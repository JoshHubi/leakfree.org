    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-was-your-thanksgiving/1951</link>
    <description>I went to my Grandma&#39;s in Berkeley and had a traditional thanksgiving family reunion. Got to see a lot of my extended famimly that I don&#39;t see that often.

While I was there somebody went along the street at night and smashed in a bunch of car windows right in front of my grandma&#39;s house, amazingly, none of our cars got hit.</description>

            <p>Spent my thanksgiving in my on-campus apartment studying my ass off for the finals.  I’m thankful (very!) my parents drove over and had a delicious (albeit sparse) shrimp dinner in my apartment.</p>

            <p>The night of was pretty sweet, too.  Went over a friend’s house, and considered driving back considering I was really tired.  Then he broke out the beer and Malibu and I decided to sleep over.</p>
<p>The four of us played 3 rounds of chandelier with Budweiser then a game of kings with Malibu and Coke.  Our stomachs were fucked but we didn’t get drunk.  Guess cause we ate so much…?</p>

            <p>The culture fail there is that my entire family emigrated here from Italy one way or another a few generations ago, so I am not implicated in any way with that dirty deed.</p>
<p>We could easily say the same about Australia and its original inhabitants…</p>
<p>And, Mangled, we’re thanking fortune.  Some thank God, but since I don’t believe in that stuff, I thank luck.  It’s good to once in a while put things into perspective and realize you could have been put in a much worse situation.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well american food is fast food, and its full of bullshit, thats why it makes you fat, but hungarian food is very spicy and fat but doesnt contain bad stuff, it’s organic or how to say it. That’s why it makes you fat, that’s the difference.</p>
<p>Edit: Soz I kinda forgot that I’m writing off topic stuff…</p>
