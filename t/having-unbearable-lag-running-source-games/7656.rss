    <title>Having unbearable lag running Source games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/having-unbearable-lag-running-source-games/7656</link>
    <description>I have recently picked up playing TF2 again and found that I cannot play through the lag im experiencing, but its not the common lag i run into.

I will play for around 5 minutes with no problems, and then all of a sudden everything around me starts to get extremely choppy.  My FPS is high and my ping is low.

Can your computer even handle TF2 noob?  Yes...

![](upload://6I6PuuEmauXO02up6hgyYXrei26.jpeg)

Have you tried turning down your graphics settings in-game?  Yes, still lags

Have you tried playing at a different resolution?  Yes, tried both 1600x900 and 1920x1080. No luck.

Have you tried reinstalling and updating TF2 and steam?  Yes

Have you tried running another game besides TF2 to rule out it being an internet problem?  Yes, I run Portal 1 and the same thing occurs.

Have you tried updating your drivers?  Yes, all of my drivers are up to date.

Do you have a firewall or Anti-virus running?  No

Are you running alot of programs while playing? No

The lag im experiencing is similar to playing in slow motion..

I have more than enough power to run a game like TF2, so I am really stumped here.  Someone HELP! :&#39;(</description>

<p>Thanks guys.  This was the advice I needed!</p>
<p>I haven’t given the inside of my computer a good cleaning and the graphics fan was clogged and overheating it.</p>
<p>Now its all clean and back to normal.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thanks again.  I hope to poke around here a little more, seems like a chill place.</p>

Anyway, on to what you’re asking about, if it starts lagging after a while of playing, find something to watch the your system temperatures.</p>

            <p>I have recently picked up playing TF2 again and found that I cannot play through the lag im experiencing, but its not the common lag i run into.</p>
<p>I will play for around 5 minutes with no problems, and then all of a sudden everything around me starts to get extremely choppy.  My FPS is high and my ping is low.</p>
<p>Can your computer even handle TF2 noob?  Yes…</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f0984456f8dd47c5beb0a68b72c3d6cf62ef2aa.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="6I6PuuEmauXO02up6hgyYXrei26" width="300" height="300"></p>
<p>Have you tried turning down your graphics settings in-game?  Yes, still lags</p>
<p>Have you tried playing at a different resolution?  Yes, tried both 1600x900 and 1920x1080. No luck.</p>
<p>Have you tried reinstalling and updating TF2 and steam?  Yes</p>
<p>Have you tried running another game besides TF2 to rule out it being an internet problem?  Yes, I run Portal 1 and the same thing occurs.</p>
<p>Have you tried updating your drivers?  Yes, all of my drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>Do you have a firewall or Anti-virus running?  No</p>
<p>Are you running alot of programs while playing? No</p>
<p>The lag im experiencing is similar to playing in slow motion…</p>
<p>I have more than enough power to run a game like TF2, so I am really stumped here.  Someone HELP! :’(</p>
