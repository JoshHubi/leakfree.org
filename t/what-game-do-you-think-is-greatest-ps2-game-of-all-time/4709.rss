<p>Everything about this game was done right. It followed the story and style of the movie without fault, even adding in prior backstory without conflicting with the film.</p>
<p>Cutscenes were excellent, as were the characters, their animations and the voices (most of which were done by the original actors).</p>
<p>The controls were fluid, simple and downright easy to use. Fights rarely felt repitive, owing less to the different moves available and more to the sheer variety of levels experienced. Gameplay was good simple fun, striking a perfect balance between combat, small navigation challenges, looting, spraying and even some proper exploration.</p>
<p>The soudtrack was excellent, using a lot of original music, newly composed stuff which still kept the style and even extended tracks from the movie trailers.</p>
<p>Topping it all off was the old Rockstar touch, with the tongue in cheek humour, odd achievements/challenges and highly entertaining “Unleash the Fury” gamemode.</p>
<p>I played the living fuck out of this game, and the only thing that it suffers from nowadays is the incredibly outdated graphics, which is more than made up for by the rest of it. See the movie and play this game today.</p>
