It always bothered me that you *had* to take damage in that tunnel, so it makes me even happier to learn that it doesn&#39;t have to be this way! Hooray.</description>

            <p>Trust me, first time I tried playing this area in HL (with cheats of course, since I wasn’t really able to finish HL without cheats because I was scared of the Alien Grunts) and I never reached the end of the tunnel.</p>

            <p>Mr. JP could have intended to make it longer than it’s respective HL counterpart since the original one bugs players so much when they try to reach the end of the tunnel. The original one was shorter to the one in BM yet what was different is that, here the player is much faster than in HL.</p>

            <p>I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure that was a swan dive.</p>
