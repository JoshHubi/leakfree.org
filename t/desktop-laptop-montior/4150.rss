    <title>Desktop + Laptop montior???</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/desktop-laptop-montior/4150</link>
    <description>I have a desktop that doesnt have a monitor and i have an unusable laptop that has a fried hard drive. Is there a cable that i could attach my desktop to my laptop, enabling me to use the screen on my laptop as a monitor? 
If the answer is no, then it cost me more than $100 to remove everything from my desktop and outfit it into my laptop? (excluding the fan).</description>

<p>You can’t just take desktop parts out of it and shove them into a laptop. They accept different kinds of parts. Like everyone else has said, either buy a new hard drive or a new monitor instead of pissing around with other solutions.</p>

            <p>^ This.</p>
<p>Making a makeshift monitor is kind of silly. Go out and spend the 60-100…I’m sure that if there was a cable, it would cost around that anyways.</p>

            <p>Well, I have to agree with sersoft, it is defiantly cheaper then 100$ to buy a new hard drive or monitor.  Also doing so will yield better results then dicking around with hooking up you laptop to your desktop.</p>

<p>A new monitor can be less than 100$ and a new laptop HDD can be way below 100.</p>
