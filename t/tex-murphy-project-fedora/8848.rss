    <title>Tex Murphy - Project Fedora</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tex-murphy-project-fedora/8848</link>
    <description>Big Finish Games is finally releasing another chapter in the Tex Murphy mystery/adventure series. I for one am very excited because the last game (&quot;Overseer&quot; released in 1999 ) left the player on a complete cliffhanger ending.

From one nerd to another; you need to play this game (if not all of them).  Even if you don&#39;t appreciate some of the cheesy humour, you can divulge yourself in the noir style setting, or the great puzzles the game contains.  Good old games sells them cheap and they work on my new pc without configuration.

They have a kickstarter [url=&#39;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/texmurphy/tex-murphy-project-fedora/&#39;]https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/texmurphy/tex-murphy-project-fedora/[/url] for their new game as well.. I will be supporting them, as games like this are too far and few between these days.:jizz:
