    <title>Traveling solo</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/traveling-solo/8737</link>
    <description>So, me and a friend were planning on visiting Finland for a week this summer. The flight was booked last month, but today my friend had to pull out because of unexpected financial difficulties on his part. This leaves me on my own with a ticket to spare.

Most of my close friends (the one&#39;s I&#39;d consider going on vacation with) are moneyless students or jobless bums, so I don&#39;t really have any options open, so was thinking about canceling the tickets (at least I was smart enough to book with cancelation possibilities).

But then again, I could also go solo.. But that idea has me absolutely terrified because I keep thinking about &quot;what if I get lost&quot;, &quot;what if I take the wrong bus somewhere&quot;, &quot;what if.. what if.. what if&quot;. So I was wondering if any of you have any experience on traveling solo and could put my mind at ease and/or give me a few tips pointers.


PS: Yes, I know I&#39;m a chickenshit faggot.</description>

            <p>I wouldn’t worry about it just because it’s the most violent country in Scandinavia. As long as you’re not Muslim, black or an Arab immigrant you should be ok. Just keep away from the neo-Nazis and skinheads.</p>

<p>why not just give the extra ticket away to one of your close friends? you didnt pay for it anyway</p>

</aside>
<p>I did and I’m not going to just give €300 away (I booked for both of us, he was going to pay me for his ticket, but he totaled his car yesterday and needs the money to get a new one).</p>
<p>Anyway, one of my main concerns is also the vulnerability of someone on his own, especially in cities. Mugging, scamming, whatever.</p>
<p>Shadi, my means of having fun are most likely a lot different than yours. Give me hiking boots and put me in a forest and I’m having fun. (Hiking and trekking is what I’m planning to do over there).</p>
<p>I really really want to go, but the thought of solo travel is pretty damn daunting to me.</p>

            <p>As to the getting lost thing, I’d suggest getting a map or three of the destinations where you want to go and, if that doesn’t help you in getting around and back to the place where you’re staying, ask around.  If you have a GPS device, all the better.</p>
<p>I’ve taken the wrong bus even where I know my way around.  Just ask the bus driver how to get to where you’re going.  They should be able to help; if not, the bussing company should have a way to get you to where you’re going.  Again, ask if you don’t have the information beforehand.</p>

            <p>As long as you use common sense I’d think you’d be fine. Finland isn’t exactly a place where people just disappear(afaik at least) so it’s not like you’re going into a dangerous place. Just contact your friends each night and tell them where you are, and where you’re headed, that way if you do go missing they’d have an idea of where to alert the authorities and look.</p>
