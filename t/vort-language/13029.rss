    <title>Vort Language</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vort-language/13029</link>
    <description>I am a bit perplexed about the vorts.

So in half life 1 they spoke that alien squigy language

by Half life 2 they had learned English and have a deep gruff voice and speak another language.

Now where I think it get&#39;s kind of weird is that if they were enslaved by a supposed ex human &quot;The Niahlinth&quot; why did they not know english.

Or do you think the vorts from HL2 are from a different place than the vorts in HL1?

It&#39;s a massive continuity error in the series in my opinion, or at least it is unexplained</description>

            <p>There’s that scene in HL2 where they mention “flux shifting” or something as a method of communication that humans can’t detect. Maybe they were using that in HL1, and it took them time to adapt to speaking vocally.</p>

            <p>Maybe the slave collars affect their vocal cords (or whatever vorts have that makes them capable of speech) somewhat similar to what electrolarynxes do for humans.</p>

            <p>The beta voices for the Vortigaunts actually sound much closer to the HL1 versions, but the trouble with that is they do not sound friendly, they sound scratchy and prickly. To make them seem like better allies, Valve probly retconned it and gave them a much smoother and warmer voice.</p>

            <p>One word: controllers.  They’re probably the same or a cousin species to Nihilanth and they’re not human.</p>

            <p>Yes, Nihilanth was a human on growth hormones, but the experiments went out of control as he grew too large for Combine to have a sufficient amount of food for him, so they decided to get rid of him instead. Poor guy had to escape and feed on Vortigaunts instead. Source: my arse.</p>

<p>There is not many concrete answers to a lot of what is in half life, that is part of the fun I guess, but I think it needs to have a proper conclusion and wrap it all up. Atleast this plotline.</p>

            <p>I posit that they’re still speaking the same language in HL2 (when they’re not speaking the player’s set audio language) as in Half-Life.  It’s just different words.  “Ooweeja, oweejya” could just be different words, such as “I’m in attack mode, don’t fuck with me” than “Gala lung” which could mean something like, “I’m calm and relaxed.”</p>

            <p>Sometimes things are just retconned without explanation tho. Either because it didn’t seem an important thing to focus at the time or because of technical limitations.</p>
<p>Valve didn’t focus on Vortigaunt communication very much on HL1, seeing as they were just a mid-tier enemy type in the context of that game but for HL2 they decided to make them allies and as such added more depth to them, which, among other changes/retcons, involved a more complex form of communication.</p>
<p>Going from weird high pitch screeches to a smoother, guttural and more elaborated form of vocalization was so big of a change that I don’t even buy the slave collar explanation.</p>
<p>It was a plain old retcon with no real explanation.</p>
<p>edit: as for how they learned english, that’s easier to explain. Enough time passed between the events of HL1 and HL2 that anyone could learn a new language, specially such intelligent creatures as vortigaunts.</p>

            <p>The Vorts are independent individuals, but when they connect with each other, they are one, almost hive-mind like mentality, so they share all knowledge. It’s highly plausible they already knew English/any human language during events of HL1. From Gordon himself perhaps, when they connected with him.</p>

            <p>Or maybe Valve did what they usually do and retconned it? If you don’t believe that bit, Flatline’s second suggestion seems perfectly reasonable to me.</p>
