Hey everyone, I come to you today with a story I have been writing since the start of this year.

Feedback is a work of My Little Pony that deals with the topic of death and what happens when a close friend is taken away. The story deals with the demise of Twilight Sparkle in the aftermath of an encounter with an ancient evil. However, there&#39;s a lot about her demise that doesn&#39;t make sense and, as her friends figure out in the wake, things can only get worse from there.

There&#39;s a fair bit of time travel involved with this story and it works with a lot of mechanics of the verse. If you enjoy works like Inception or Pheonix Wright, then you may enjoy this story as well.

            <p>I honestly didn’t think I’d get any sort of response since my track record hasn’t been all that good. Which is a shame because I’m really really proud of what I’ve done.</p>
<p>Nor did I expect any really, since this is straight promotion. It’s like advertizing a movie; pitching it in the hopes that orhers will see and enjoy it.</p>

<p>Yikes, did I? I put it through a lot of revisions but regretted posting it anyways because it sounded almost robotic. I’ll chop off everything superfluous.</p>

            <p>A My Little Pony story is just about the last thing I expected here. I notice that your work is part of the “The Shameless Self-Promotion Bureau” and “The Self-Promotion Group”…</p>
<p>Random works of fan fiction are not really my kind of thing but if there is something specific about it you want to discuss then I would be glad to. I strive to write well for other kinds of media and could use the practice.</p>
