    <title>Error With Installer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/error-with-installer/9521</link>
    <description>I have downloaded the installer.exe file; I have downloaded the BlackMesa archive file. However, when I run the install, it tells me that it &quot;cannot find BlackMesa.7z&quot; But the file that *I* have is called &quot;BlackMesa.ZIP&quot; Changing the file extension makes the install go further, but returns fatal errors. Is there a completely separate file archive....one with 7z extension and one with a &quot;ZIP&quot; extension? I don&#39;t get it.....</description>

            <p>You could try to manually unzip the ZIP file into your steam folder, which should look something like this in the end:<br>
C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS<br>
All the files and folders should go into the BMS folder that you might have to create  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
