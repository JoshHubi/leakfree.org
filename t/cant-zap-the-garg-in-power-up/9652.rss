    <title>Can&#39;t zap the Garg in Power Up</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-zap-the-garg-in-power-up/9652</link>
    <description>Unless I&#39;ve missed a step somewhere, I think I&#39;ve found a glitch that&#39;s preventing me from progressing in Power Up.

I cleared the debris from the generator, flipped the switch to power it up, then went back up and talked to the injured guard to prepare the tram, and hit the button to open the door. I ran down the hallway to the place where you zap the Garg, but the button isn&#39;t doing anything.

Map name is bm_c2a1a
Position is -1338 x, 2452 y, 276 z</description>

            <p>I found that right after I submitted this post. I even looked around to double check that there wasn’t something else I had to do in the room. &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Sneaky devs. Thanks, though!</p>
