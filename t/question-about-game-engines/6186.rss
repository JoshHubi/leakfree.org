    <title>question about game engines.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/question-about-game-engines/6186</link>
    <description>So I play Black Hawk Down, and Joint Ops/escalation. They use ALMOST the same engine. JO/E uses an updated version of the black hawk down engine. So i was wondering if anyone would know if it was possible to port the weapons from JO/E over to BHD, even though JO/e is an updated engine.</description>

<p>if you play, BHD was going to have drivable vehicles for the 1.5 update. except novalogic decided to save it for JO.</p>

            <p>It would probably be easier to port BHD to the updated engine, since I’d assume the weapons used the upgrades. Also, how upgraded is the engine?</p>

            <p>If the engine can be modded, I suppose you could.</p>
