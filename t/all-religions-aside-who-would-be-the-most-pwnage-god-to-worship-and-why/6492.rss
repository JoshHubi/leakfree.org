<p>If you believe seriously as a believer in an Abrahamic God that ANY other religion is right then you are not a true believer in your faith, because as a Jew you don’t believe that Jesus was the son of God and you also don’t believe in the words of the prophet Mohammad, if you are Muslim you believe that Jesus was not the son of God and you believe in the words of the prophet Mohammad, and as a Roman-Catholic believing anything else after the words of Jesus Christ and his disciples as coming from God is blasphemous.</p>
<p>But then Christianity is the buffet of religions where you get to pick and choose from a bunch of rules what you want to believe.</p>
