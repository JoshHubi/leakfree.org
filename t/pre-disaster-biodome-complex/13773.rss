    <title>Pre-Disaster Biodome Complex</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pre-disaster-biodome-complex/13773</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;ve recently been editing bm_c2a4e to reflect it&#39;s pre-disaster state, and I&#39;d like to get some criticism on the lighting (which I feel is kinda wonky).

            <p>Agree with JeffMOD, get rid of the white lighting as it just washes everything out, you might have to experiment a little with very subtle colour values to compliment the blue lab textures.</p>
<p>Look forward to seeing your next update.</p>

            <p>ooh, i really wanna see this! keep working on it pl0x</p>
<p>the lighting, to me, looks fine for a laboratory setting. although, the lighting in the airlock (third picture) looks to be a bit too intense next to those windows. but don’t listen to me, i know nothing about mapping lol</p>

            <p>I suppose it could stand to have more of a colour tint to the lighting - so far just about everything but the desk lamp seems to be using pure white, which is a little bit boring.<br>
Aside from that I can’t think of any improvements offhand - if this is a predisaster version, it wouldn’t make sense for random lights in the halls to be off or broken to create contrasting areas of light and shadow.</p>
