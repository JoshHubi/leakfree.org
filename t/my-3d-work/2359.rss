    <title>my 3d work</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-3d-work/2359</link>
    <description>most of these are works in progress, most of my work that&#39;s finished is under &#39;Non Disclosure Agreements&#39; from where I work.

Here&#39;s a room I&#39;m designing for my sons bedroom/entertainment room.

More pics of room if you want to see them.


Here are my character works all made in maya and works in progress.

Model I made of my wife as she posed. 
1. [url]https://eyesore1551.shackspace.com/blinkn.jpg[/url]

This is a wip on the anatomy/muscle of the male body
2. [url]https://eyesore1551.shackspace.com/green.jpg[/url]

This is one my first textures jobs i never got around to finishing.
3.  [url]https://eyesore1551.shackspace.com/JaxonWIP.jpg[/url]

4.This is an anime inspired Spiderman that the head isnt done yet.
[url]https://eyesore1551.shackspace.com/animebody.jpg[/url]

5. My first try at a body with Nurbs.
[url]https://eyesore1551.shackspace.com/body.jpg[/url]

6. Low poly creature for mod that never went anywhere kept because I liked the design of it.
[url]https://webpages.charter.net/eyesore/masher.jpg[/url]

7. Just to show you new modelers out there. Keep at it. Practice makes perfect, going to school for it is a waste of time and money - just buy dvds or practice. Everyone I know at valve (and its a good bit) just worked hard at it alone. when they were 12-13. Game DEsign  degrees are a joke as are animation degrees.


For character models/animations/facial expressions Maya has no second best it is the best in the field. Most dev companies movie and game use maya for such things. Though 3D Studio Max is still widely used but being kinda ran over by other products like XSI(SoftImage)/Maya/MudBox. Which is why the Autodesk bought about discreet and took 3D Studio Max (Autodesk = Maya first)

Though I still feel Maya and others still need to take note on 3D Studio Max&#39;s renderer. 

Crits and suggestions are welcome on all.</description>
