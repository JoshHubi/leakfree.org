    <description>So, I&#39;m wondering if anyone out there has the new Medal of Honor and if it&#39;s any good. It looks like a good game and the multiplayer beta was pretty good when I played it. I was just wondering if it&#39;s worth a buy seeing as I already own Black Ops, BFBC2, and CSS. Is it worth the $44.99 it&#39;s currently on sale for on steam?</description>

            <p>Well Modern Warfare and MW2 are also based on an ongoing conflict. It doesn’t explicitly say “Afghanistan”, it just shows the Middle East. And it’s a bit morally questionable when you go into an airport in Moscow and kill hundreds of people.</p>

            <p>No I think Stuntz meant that Medal of Honour was band, not COD black ops. The game is based around an ongoing conflict and therefore is treading on a lot of toes, even if it is a fictional story.</p>

<p>I find it very wierd how the US military banned it from selling it at military base stores. So only way to get it for poor us in Okinawa is for friends back in the states to send it over.</p>

</aside>
<p>Wow, really?<br>
That’s especially strange because the US army was one of the big “product placement” people in MW1/2. (basically, asking to give the army a good image, show off all their new toys, and make everyone brave and badass)</p>
<p>I guess black ops focused more on the shadowy, morally-questionable edges of the military, so that image was lost.</p>

<p>Yeah, but you implied BC2 on Steam has the Steamworks features, like Steam achievements and being able to join a friend’s game through the Steam friends list. It doesn’t have any of that, just auto-updates and time logger.</p>

<p>I got it in I believe July, though. School’s kept me pretty busy too. And I’ll admit that after I unlocked everything, I got pretty bored. So this morning I created a new soldier and I’m doing it again. The whole anticipation of being rewarded for teamwork/kills/objectives with specs/weapons/gadgets is a great motivation to play more.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed the campaign. Despite the fact that it is very short, and has a terrible ending, it was good fun. The weapons felt much heavier than those in CoD and the destruction was alot of fun. Multiplayer is far better though, even though I barely get any kills and have no PC friends to play in a squad with…half the fun.</p>

            <p>The singleplayer campaign in Bad Company 2 is pretty god awful. Maybe that’s a bit of an overexaggeration, but I kind of forced myself to play through it before I even thought about touching the multiplayer. It’s about 5-7 hours long.</p>
<p>I think this picture sums up my opinion of the multiplayer, though:<br>

            <p>I have been playing through Black ops…and I am not amazingly impressed so far. I can’t get into the story, and the missions are more of the same, it was good the first time…it was even good in MW2, but when you have three games in a series with very similar gameplay, it gets pretty damn tiresome. The frustrating Vietnam levels…I have never felt so angry when playing CoD before.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got to play a little MoH at a friends house. It really does feel like CoD, but not as well done. I also recommend Bad Company 2, even though I suck at it.</p>

            <p>I was very disappointed with Medal of Honour. The campaign was way too short, it took me around 5 hours to complete on the hardest setting and Im a very average player. Story isn’t really that exciting and the characters aren’t developed enough. The AI is incredibly stupid. It annoys me that you can throw a frag into a nest of baddies and they will just ignore it. COD isn’t any better. Multiplayer I found appalling. Just tiny COD style maps with the DICE engine. Loved BF Bad Company 2 multiplayer though.</p>
<p>MOH is EA’s attempt at making a COD killer and it shows. Instead of trying to innovate they have just emulated it poorly.</p>
<p>Black Ops Campaign is good, better than MOH and MW2 but again other than the story doesn’t innovate. Multiplayer is more of the same again with the addition of various “ideas” like COD points.</p>
<p>I would say you would be much better off going for BF Bad Company 2 if you wanted to get a good SP and great MP game for PC.</p>

            <p>I honestly can’t think of many maps where people actually use sniper rifles at a good range, except your examples…also I just thought of that snow one, it was pretty good for sniping. I don’t even really see the point in this discussion though, as CoD is a close to medium quarters game, I don’t see why it needs long range except for in a couple of maps. I haven’t played Black Ops yet(I do own it however) so I can’t speak for it’s maps yet, but I doubt they are anything special.</p>

<p>Garthbartin, you have to admit that most of the Call of Duty maps are close quarters. MW2’s long range maps are pretty much limited to your examples(I don’t even know what ‘Bailout’ is though, was it in the map pack?) and MW probably had one or two, and I can’t even think of them off the top of my head. WaW had Outskirts, Seelow, and a couple of others but it was generally a bad game so it doesn’t really count.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Bailout was from the first map pack. Sub base, a generally very close quarters map, has one or two long range sniping areas. Skidrow has long corridors and some large open areas. No matter what map you pick you can find just about any kind of combat in it. In Black Ops, not so much.</p>

<p>First sentence: There IS NO gameplay variation in ANY of the Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>Second: You’re a god damn moron if you think ANY of the Call of Duty games have had anything BUT close quarters maps.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I just explained why there is gameplay variation. You can’t tell me there isn’t gameplay variation without explaining why I’m wrong. There are completely different strategies to playing the game. That adds at least SOME gameplay variation. And excluding a couple cheap strategies like tubing, all of them are pretty even.</p>
<p>And CoD has relatively close and relatively long. ofc it’s not going to have anything BFBC2 style, but there are maps with short and long range. Look at Wasteland, you’re lying to me if you tell me that’s not a long range map. And bailout (I’m pretty sure that’s it’s name) has a massive street from one end of the map to another. Have you played MW2 for more than an hour? The ONLY long range in Black Ops is Array, and Array sucks because most of the Black Ops guns are for short range, not long range.</p>

            <p>Teh Frog, the Medal of Honor is not worth the full price. I’d suggest getting it on a sale or something.</p>

            <p>I thought Modern Warfare 2 was far superior to World at War, but that is not saying much at all. My favourite is probably the first Modern Warfare, but it has some problems and I got sick of it quickly.</p>
