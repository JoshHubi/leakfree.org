    <title>Great Mod! But please BRING BACK THE M16!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/great-mod-but-please-bring-back-the-m16/10083</link>
    <description>Thanks guys for the best mod ever made. Will be a long time before this is surpassed. But the weapons are hideous. Clunky and poorly balanced. The M16 is a much nicer looking weapon than the mp5. Also  AI are expert marksmen from 100 feet. These a just small nitpicks, that if fixed, will make this game a lot more fun to play. Thx</description>

            <p>Yeah I know…</p>
<p>But maybe the Community could implement something that would let you be able to carry an MP5, M4A1 Assault Rifle, Crossbow, and SPAS-12.</p>
<p>And a Glock 17, Beretta M92FS, and a Colt Python.</p>
<p>And you can pick up a silencer for the Glock and M9.</p>

            <p>I GOT IT!</p>
<p>Guys, I got the perfect solution.</p>
<p>Remember in Half-Life 2 how there’s the SMG1 and AR2?</p>
<p>Maybe the M16 could be like in the AR2 slot!</p>
<p>This way you could have the MP5, M16, Crossbow, and SPAS-12 at the same time!</p>
<p>A GENIUS SOLUTION!</p>
<p>Don’t you think?!</p>
<p>Then make the M16 have 30 Rounds and MP5 have 50 rounds out of a 250 9mm Cap.</p>
<p>Also maybe you could have 3 pistols…</p>
<p>A Glock 17, a Beretta M92FS, and a Colt Python?</p>
<p>Ah well, that’s what I think would be a solution for all the Half-Life 1 fans wanting HD pack and SD pack at the same time.</p>

Gee, I mean monsters coming from another planet, a scientist slaughtering hundreds of marines who themselves were slaughtering American civilians, okay, but ON TOP OF THAT, you’d have an M16 use 9mm ammunition?<br>

He survived a close up blast of focused harmonic radiation that DISSOLVED scientists who touched it. That’s how powerful the HEV Suit is. And even after that, it wasn’t even depleted that far.

<p>Well, when a marine can shotgun me from the dam and i can empty an MP5 clip on his buddy and not kill him, that feels pretty broken to me.<br>
The HECUs can stand a few hundred feet back and kill me in a few seconds while I struggle to hit them with anything. Ramboing them just gets me killed and none of the guns the player gets are really effective beyond 50ft or so.</p>
<p>If the MP5 just didnt spread so much or at least did more damage than the glock it would all be fine.</p>

<p>Depends on the version of the M16, you can get an M16 that takes the 9 x 19mm Parabellum cartridges which is the same that Glock takes, and Glocks take just about every type of magazine that uses the same cartridge. So you could take an MP5 mag or a even the M16 9mm magazine and out it in a Glock and vice versa.</p>

<p>but the hound eyes were never meant to be dangerous enemies. it seems that most of the stuff mod creators did was useless changes to combat mechanics to make it more difficult. crowbar got downgraded, pistol got downgraded, revolver stayed the same which I’m happy with, and the m16 got downgraded… what was the point of re-building fundamental half-life game play? its not faithful to the original or the second.</p>
<p>don’t get me wrong i want changes, in fact the stuff that’s been additions over existing game play has been great, the proper 02 counter, sprint, ADS, crowbar now properly hitting head crabs in the air. but i just cant stand how much the base mechanics have been changed, i wanted to play half-life not a different game. the new level areas alone make it different and interesting enough</p>

<p>Houndeyes were also never meant to be fought close range, no matter how bad they were</p>
<p>Point is: Any damage = Bad</p>
<p>I’d rather spam the pistol from range then go in close and risk damage just to kill it with a crowbar</p>

<p>So instead of the game making its own mark on the series by improving things in the devs’s visions, it should have blindly parroted the exact mechanics of the original for better or worse?

<p>Yep.  I say we have the MP5 lets use it but make it more useful.  I spent half the game using either the cross bow or the .357 magnum revolver when dealing with soldiers.  My second play through I did have fun using the MP5 shooting the fire doors crushing HECU grunts as well as rolling grenades under the almost closed door.  Besides that the MP5 just seemed useless to me unless I was able to get head shots off on the HECU grunts.</p>

<p>Now on the topic of bringing the M16 back, I dont care.  I just want the rifle to be made useful.  Four HECU`s pop up and you go from 250 rounds down to just 50 rounds left.  That seems a little on the excessive side to me.</p>

<p>He lied? Alright, he made a minor mistake, IF THAT<br>
Just because nobody here wants the M16</p>
<p>And yeah, sorry for late ragepost, but some people were just throwing out terrible arguments</p>

<p>There actually is a difference.</p>
<p>You KNOW an M16 doesn’t use 9mm ammunition. You DON’T know that scientists won’t accidentally tear a hole into another universe and let weird Extra terrestrials through to our world. I’m not saying expect that to ever happen, but part of the game is suspension of disbelief, and small details that are realistic like that, or bigger ones, like having the level design make sense and not just be there for you to fight in, help lend to that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the fact that this post spawned several pages of argument, regardless of who is closer to accurate, disproves the point that it’s such intuitive knowledge that ignoring it would ruin suspension of disbelief.</p>
<p>I think Bloodshot was just making a point in principle, and it’s a valid point, but the argument that followed is really not a legitimate consideration. It’s just elitists flaunting their specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>Just because something is a real-world object doesn’t mean it needs to be exactly duplicated to be accepted in a fictional game world. If most players don’t find the difference blindingly obvious, there isn’t an issue with suspension of disbelief. There are facts far more common knowledge than which bullet goes with which gun that are ignored by most movies or story-heavy video games.</p>

            <p>I was poking around in the wiki and found this about the m4.  Made me laugh.  Also, the wiki did say that the mp5 would be a weapon that was neither great at ranged combat or damage but would be like a gun to fit in the middle somewhere. I may have mistranslated that but you can look yourself.</p>
<p>"Here is another official response.</p>
<p>The M4 will NOT be included in the mod.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we said so. We are the developers. We decide what the final product will entitle. Some of you will :’( while the grown ups will move on to provide insightful ideas on other aspects of the mod."</p>

            <p>umm im just gonna add this , i dont mind the mp5 and i understand why the devs made the one they put in there , the models of the weapons are very similar to the original , notice the mp5 has no front post in the sight circle , its a simple mp5 model a lot like the original , however i loved having an m4 but to be honest i liked the new /old mp5 they had originally planned for black mesa and it shared the ammo even though i would use the m4 even though in real life it doesnt share ammo i wouldnt mind being able to use the different models and simply hope that somebody figures out a way to replace the view models of the weapons in bms (the best source mod i have ever been privileged enough to play … thanks developers)</p>

<p>Not with that magazine loadout, no. I merely stated that as a general statement in regards to the capacity of an M16 and/or M4A1 to be able to fire .9mm rounds. Doesn’t mean that the original intent was for that to take place regardless of the model used.</p>
<p>In any case, an M4A1 is essentially a poor man’s M16, and really, they practically are the same gun. With 80% of the parts being the same, the M4A1 is simply a shorter and lighter variant of the M16.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Careful, I tried replying with an informative post but look what it got me, a bunch of bs.  Just a heads up it might not be worth it in this case when dealing with this guy.</p>
<p>Most variants of the M16 including the carbines typically used the same lower receiver with a different upper receiver.  There were quite a few M16-A1<code>s out there in the 60</code>s and 70<code>s that had earlier M16 lower receivers pre fence than there were of the correct M16-A1</code>s with the correct lower receiver partial fence.</p>

<p>M16/M4 or MP5. Same ammo pool or even a different one. It doesn’t matter. The most important thing is that this ridiculous burst mode is removed or at least a switch method is introduced. Every other weapon I used (so far) seemed right.</p>

            <p>I wouldnt mind seeing the m4a1 or m16 or any varriation added, as long as it doesn’t replace the mp5 or use 9mm, would work if the HECU forces had a chance to spawn with it…  Though making it use its own caliber would lead to shortages if the only way to obtain it was by killing HECU marines, going back though the game and adding stashes every few encounters is always a (slightly lengthy but doable) option. Bonus points awarded if you take the 203 off the mp5, and leave it on the m16/m4a1/whatever.</p>

<p>When the lower receiver is chambered to fire a different round. Yeah. They can.</p>
<p>But the skin change was just an esthetics thing, so who gives a shit if doesn’t <span class="bbcode-i">look like</span> it’s chambered for 9mm. I’d be happy with an M4A1 skin to be honest</p>
