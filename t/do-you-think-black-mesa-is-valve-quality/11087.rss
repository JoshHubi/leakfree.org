    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/do-you-think-black-mesa-is-valve-quality/11087</link>
    <description>so yeah, i think this mod is pretty amazing and it feels like a real AAA title, but do you think it reaches valve&#39;s level of quality? i  am talking about pacing,enemy placement,weapon progression and all those things that valve&#39;s hl does brilliantly? (particularly in hl2 IMO).

            <p>I took a look at Narbacular Drop, which was the inspiration for Portal.  Many that worked on Narbacular Drop were hired by Valve to work on Portal.  Narbacular Drop was very crude and definitely not Black Mesa quality, so, it is my assertion that Black Mesa <em>IS</em> Valve quality.</p>
<p>Same with “Tag” and the inspiration for Portal 2.</p>

            <p>It does have Valve Quality, the mod looks beautiful, is great to play, recreats the world at the Black Mesa Research Facility quite well and if they listen to the community to get rid of the bugs and change some gameplay stuff (AI and such), animations (crowbar), … this mod is gonna be even better …</p>

            <p>No. - Not saying they’re worse, just different. BM did some things better, but they also did some things worse. Valve is very good about keeping everything very consistent throughout. If the two were compared on a line graph, they would both be about the same height, but BM would be a big wavy sine curve, and Valve would be a straight line down the middle. Both quality products, but different feels.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes and no. Yes, for that they did a very good job, and, obviously enough, gave everything they could to achieve the best possible level of quality. No, for the fact that Valve has a incomparable means, resulting in amazingly polished games, where a mod like BMS can not attain that level of perfection and being tested to such an extent at the moment of its release.</p>
<p>That said, it’s certainly one of the best, if not the best, mod I’ve ever played. And I’ll probably won’t play the original Half Life again much, because of it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Exceeds Valve’s attention to detail and animations (besides the crowbar) in many ways (bridge crumbling was PHENOMENAL!). I encountered no bugs/errors besides crashing to desktop 2-3 times through my entire playthrough, and my only real issue is with the marines difficulty (simply increasing the time they notice you would fix it imo, you can’t really sneak past them except for in the sewers on Surface Tension). I can’t even remember how many moments this game literally took my breath away, every other minute I was gasping at an incredible view or some spectacular new animation/cool as shit texture (like when hit with the bullsquid’s spray). It’s not on Valve’s level of voice acting, AI, or performance (with the crashes and all), but it sure as fuck is on their level of level design, animation, texture design, detail, effort, and the list goes on and on. I had a better time playing this game than any of the Valve games. This game did a spectacular job of giving the player breathtaking views and it did a very good job with pacing. Just my two cents.</p>

            <p>The only “Valve” games I’ve played are Half-Life and Team Fortress II, so I can’t really say anything about the “valve quality”.</p>
<p>Black Mesa is a very good and strong game.<br>
It probably has some flaws, but they weren’t important to me while I was playing.</p>

            <p>Some more sound effects would be nice, especially hitting some surfaces with crowbar sounds weird, and now you have mentioned the Bullsquid, yes… it makes fewer noises than in the original, but this goes for other enemies as well… too bad  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Its very close since when you think about it this mod is free and cost nothing so i would say its the best mod i have played on a game if  i would rank them all this is for sure number one for me. They could easily charged 10-15$ and i would gladly payed havent encountered any bugs or crashes yet and it plays like a very nice game that deserves all credit to the makers.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Yes, I think it is.</p>
<p>Remakes I’ve played:<br>
[COLOR=‘SeaGreen’]Super Prince of Persia,<br>
[COLOR=‘SeaGreen’]Dune 2000,<br>
Conker - Bad Fur Day Reloaded<br>
Super Mario All-Stars,<br>
Ninja Gaiden Trilogy,<br>
[COLOR=‘SeaGreen’]Star Fox 64 (considered a remake of Star Fox (Super NES),<br>
Star Fox 64 3D,<br>
Super Mario 64 DS,<br>
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D,<br>
[COLOR=‘SeaGreen’]Earthworm Jim,<br>
Super Street Fighter II Turbo Hyper Remix,<br>
GoldenEye Wii (more of a reboot),<br>
Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes,<br>
[COLOR=‘SeaGreen’]Resident Evil (GameCube).</p>
<p>The thing with remakes: You <span class="bbcode-b">always</span> need to sacrifice some stuff for many reasons. One of them is to update to the new standard. The ambitious plan of giving Super Street Fighter II Turbo an HD format, didn’t work, because they wanted to keep every frame of every character the same so that it wouldn’t feel different. This made the HD work look choppy and ‘old’.<br>
MGS1 remake was cool, but felt even more linear, because the controls were updated, while the bosses’ AI weren’t. And even though the levels were updated, they didn’t feel like they were meant for this new control system, either.</p>
<p>Playing Black Mesa, I felt as if I were sent back to when I played it for the first time on our—then—super gaming PC. After I completed it, I started playing the original again, and I was amazed how idealized my memories were of it. The game clearly looks very dated, the dialogue is of clear low audio quality, and the controls—while fluid—are quite unrealistic.</p>
<p>Black Mesa isn’t flawless, no. I miss the sudden elevator fall after you press the button to continue further. I like the new Houndeye’s howling, but I miss the BullSquid’s crying, though I love its new spitting and the radioactive junk’s glowing. Then again, Bullsquid is now probably my favorite character. Lastly, the Marines’ taunting are flawed and too over the top.</p>
<p>Though these decisions were made. And that’s like three complaints, where only the Marines’ changes affect the story (now, they know and are ordered to especially kill Gordon from the start). And, had Valve made this HL1 update, I bet they would’ve had to make the same hard decisions to change things or not, resulting in some sacrifices, some complaints. Probably different ones, but still, complaints.</p>
<p>The new puzzles are great. The added dialogue, included women, the music… I could go on. So much is done so well. And all for free. If it would’ve said: made by Valve, and the product would’ve cost me money, I would’ve believe it and buy it.</p>

            <p>It’s almost within hugging distance of Valve quality, but it’s mostly held back by the asinine amounts of crouch jumping.  Valve would have focus tested that annoying habit to oblivion.</p>

            <p>In general, after my third play through, I have to say most of the battles are pretty spectacular, it was exactly what I was expecting, and more. I was a bit bummed from the lack of alien vs grunt battles or the emphasis on an Alien invasion as well. While it’s not up to par with Valve’s work, it’s certainly up there, and I will keep both on my drive for quite a while.</p>
<p>I customized my skill.cfg and refined it to be more on a realistic level, the first play through was pretty brutal, but after getting used to it I managed to get through the game with out turning on God mode once and died far less frequently. Beyond that, the combat was satisfying, even if lacking the occasional alien vs grunt fight here and there.</p>
<p>I do hope they include some of the cut content after (it’s actually more of an if) it gets finished. I would love to see some more content and have an initiative to restart the game from scratch.</p>

<p>Yes, the level of detail, the level design, are glorious…I’m still drooling.<br>
But the gameplay is off. That is what is lacking yet. The jumping and the marines are just bad. They can improve a little yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s my take on it, as well. Black Mesa impresses, and greatly, in all ways visual. The game, simply put, looks amazing in every single location.</p>
<p>But a game is more than just visuals, and actual gameplay is where I find Black Mesa falters. Marine AI just doesn’t work for me, some weapons seem very bad while others seem far too good with far too much ammo. Some of the jumping puzzles seem suspect, as well.</p>
<p>The “storytelling through environment” could also be better. Because of how things were cut and reshuffled, the game’s “alien invasion” angle is drastically downplayed and its “military invasion” angle massively over-emphasised, changing the overall feel for something I just don’t think works as well. The original was more Doom 3 while Black Mesa is more FEAR.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s “Valve quality,” but that’s a pretty high water mark to aim for. I still feel that Black Mesa is a great AAA game, but I still feel it can use major tweaks and additions.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest complaints I have about any review/expectation of a sequel of any title, is the fact that it is compared to something and has a standard to live up to, and is expected to exceed.</p>
<p>When Half-Life came out, it had no criteria to meet, no fans to please, and no expected qualities and story line, and due to this, it was received very well and created a rather large following.</p>
<p>Even though Black Mesa isn’t a sequel per se, it is being compared to Half Life, and that is an extremely tough crowd to please.</p>
<p>The thing that puzzles me the most are the first few posts on Valve Time, complaining about the soundtrack being shit.</p>
<p>I’m sorry but I’m still to this minute listening to the soundtrack by itself, it’s fantastic. Yes, it isn’t remastered, recreated versions of the Half Life soundtrack, but I wouldn’t want it to be. I would honestly find that extremely boring and unoriginal.</p>
<p>So in terms of the question is it Valve quality, yes I think it’s on par with Half Life considering this is a free mod done by people who most likely had nothing to do with HL or HL2, but at the same time no, not in the way most are expecting which can be summarized as “OMG I’m going to be able to play Half Life on the Source Engine, with updated graphics and physics! This will be EXACTLY like it was 10+ years ago!”</p>

            <p>I’d say it’s ‘close-to, but not quite’.</p>
<p>Give me a patch that fixes the buggy tentacle beast in Blast Pit, makes the enemy AI a bit less prescient/hair trigger, and changes the jumping mechanics to something closer to HL2, and I’d be happy to refer to it as ‘Valve quality’.</p>

            <p>I think many parts of the game really stands out as VALVe quality mapping and structure and finess. But the game as a whole isnt. But that’s probably because of all minor bugs, an unpaid team doing it on their free time etc.</p>
<p>Sequences with VALVe quality:</p>
<p>QE chapter + end battle (this part blew my mind).<br>
Lambda Core (the reactor, OMG… too bad it’s laggy)<br>
Resonance Cascade whole chapter<br>
Office Complex<br>
The cliff</p>
<p>Many more stuff, but these parts stood out, atleast for me.</p>

<p>What? No.</p>
<p>While it’s a great game and all it has far too many minor (and major) flaws for me to call it “Valve Quality”. That’s not to say it isn’t a great game or anything, it’s just that it is not Valve quality and is riddled with flaws.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know how you can say such thing. They didn’t have the resources and money of Valve and they had released a professional product that is better than most overpriced titles. Really, I don’t get why people have the guts to say such things. I hope you’re trolling. Because just a troll can say things like these. It’s shame that this world it’s full of ungrateful jerks. I’m ashamed. You really don’t know how much it’s difficult and costly making a game from scratch without any “big company” support and resources. Just imagine what they could have done with Valve support and resources. Think before saying bullshit.</p>

            <p>If you think the budget they had and that they have made it without any external support, I say a straight and big YES. These guys are incredible, the did all this for free and result is a mod that can compete with most commercial titles. I can’t be more proud than this. Great job guys.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>If Valve remade the game they would have access to their latest source files. That means the game would look a crap ton better than Black Mesa.</p>
<p>If Valve only had access to SDK 2007 like the BM team, then I think the end result would be comparable to Black Mesa.</p>
