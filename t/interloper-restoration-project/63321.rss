    <description>Hi. New at mapping here. I’m thinking of adding the 2 missing tentacle nests to Interloper. I was wondering if you guys would be able to tell me what area of BMS&#39; interpretation of the chapter best corresponds to where those 2 nests were in the original game, so I know where to put them? The other missing part (the Manta Puzzle section) will be added at a later date.</description>
