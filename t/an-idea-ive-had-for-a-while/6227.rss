    <title>an idea I&#39;ve had for a while...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/an-idea-ive-had-for-a-while/6227</link>
    <description>has anyone else ever considered somehow porting features of Black Mesa such as the face creation system or the deathcam into HL2/episodes? My computer impotence stops me from doing anything whatsoever, nor do I even know if it&#39;s possible. but I thought it might be a good idea to see what you peoples think.

PS: I did a search, nothing, sorry if this has come up before.

PPS: I considered putting this in the suggestion box but I figured it&#39;s not directly related to the mod.

PPPS: Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not suggessting that the [i]Devs[/i] do this; I&#39;m just seeing if anyone in general has ever thought of this also.</description>

            <p>Yeah, good luck getting 'em.  After this thing’s released, they’re probably going to take a good long vacation in Mexico, complaining about salt in their margaritas.</p>
