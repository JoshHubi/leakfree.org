    <title>On A Rail texture issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/on-a-rail-texture-issues/14436</link>
    <description>So I seem to be getting texture issues in the chapter &#39;On a Rail&#39;. What seems to be happening is there&#39;s.... just not a texture there. So that&#39;s causing it to look like it&#39;s dragging textures near it in the area where there seems to be none? I&#39;m not sure how to describe it.
I would have tried to provide coordinates and the map the bug occured in but the console doesn&#39;t seem to want to open for me? If I get that working I&#39;ll be happy provide that info.

These two are at the first area in On a Rail though (right after Power Up), after you go down on the cart and there&#39;s the office with a zombie (hitting it&#39;s head on the window) and a headcrab.

Slightly further down, not much though, near the crashed carts and cave-in.

This one only seems to occur once you&#39;ve gone up the rails going up, past the area where you can look up and see a bullsquid and a barnacle. It doesn&#39;t seem to occur when you&#39;re where you see it happen.

            <p>It appears to me that the water isn’t reflecting the props, and it’s then reflecting the nodraw that’s behind the doors.</p>
<p>In your advanced graphics settings, for Water Detail, try to change from “Reflect World”. Try “Simple Reflections” if your computer isn’t the best, or “Reflect All” if it can handle it, and let us know if the issue is still present.</p>

            <p>This sounds like an exposed nodraw error to me, but I cannot see anything out of the ordinary in any of the screenshots…?</p>
