    <title>Difficulty Not Affecting Damage Dealt By Player</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/difficulty-not-affecting-damage-dealt-by-player/13926</link>
    <description>Damage inflicted by the player doesn&#39;t seem to be affected by game difficulty.

No matter which difficulty I have the game set to, and no matter what values I have set for [b]sk_dmg_inflict_scale1 [/b](easy), [b]sk_dmg_inflict_scale2[/b] (normal), and [b]sk_dmg_inflict_scale3[/b] (hard), enemies require the same amount of shots/damage to be killed.

Since the difficulty descriptions state that they should be affecting player damage, this seems to be a glitch.

(There seems to be no problems with damage dealt [i]to  [/i]the player--difficulty appears to be working fine in that regard.)</description>
