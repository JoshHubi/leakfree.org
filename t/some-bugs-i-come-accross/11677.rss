    <title>Some Bugs I come accross</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-bugs-i-come-accross/11677</link>
    <description>Not sure if they have been listed or noted. I will post it anyways.

-When opening Black Mesa, I get Node graph out of date, it happens with ever map load.

-Main Menu: Options does not work. As in it does not open

-Tram: Upon Gordon&#39;s Arrival, the guard is supposed to open the door for you. This doesn&#39;t happen. There is no guard, at all. Also note, upon arrival the game doesn&#39;t load the next map. Maybe the cause of this issue. Regardless as I was arriving where was no guard.

I currently have every single half-life game out there. I have Source Base 2006-2007, SourceSDK.

I also tried running Source 2007 from the Tools section, looks just like Half-Life: Lost Coast in the menu screen. But yea.

AMD Sempron 3000+ 1.99ghz

<p>The Immediate option you should attempt is to Delete what you’ve got, and to Reinstal Black Mesa.</p>
<p>Chances are, if you left your computer Idle for too long while the file downloaded, and it went into ‘sleep’ mode, some portions were left out of the Download; or some things in general didn’t get downloaded//transferred at all.</p>
<p>If the Problem persists, it may be a hardware issue; your machine does not look too optimal to be running Black Mesa at a desirable level, but I’ve seen some crappier machines run it as well.</p>

</aside>
<p>I installed the game twice, computer doesn’t go in sleep mode. My CPU is fine running Source Engine. So I really don’t know whats wrong.</p>
