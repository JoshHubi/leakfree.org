    <title>Let&#39;s talk about the Crowbar</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lets-talk-about-the-crowbar/11422</link>
    <description>Am I the only one here with the feeling that the crowbar is unreasonably OP? Even on hard, if I&#39;m in melee range of something, I can kill it right goddamn fast, much faster than with anything short of explosives. It hits hard and in abnormally quick succession after landing the initial blow. This is off-putting and removes much of the immersion of having an &quot;under-dog&quot; weapon. 

[u][b]This is what I suggest;[/b][/u]

[b]1)[/b] Make each hit have [i]weight[/i], aka, each blow isn&#39;t immediately followed with another blow moments after the initial. Allow 1-1.5 seconds between blows.

[b]2)[/b] Make each hit have [i]force[/i], aka, minor increase in damage to account for the slower speeds.

[b]3)[/b] Please [b]remake the animations[/b]. Is it possible to have an actual swing associated with the crowbar, instead of some instantaneous love-tap that looks like it&#39;d sooner annoy a headcrab than kill it? Make the damned thing swing!


I may be alone in my opinions with the crowbar, but it&#39;s literally the only thing that stood out to me as a gameplay killer. Where the rest of the weapons have some fantastic love put into them, from textures to animations, it&#39;s shocking to see the weapon iconic with the brand be the most lazily represented.</description>

<p>I feel like the crowbar should be raised above Gordon’s head for the swing, it would seem more powerful that way, powerful enough to smash crates and such.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That was basically going to be the idea for a secondary attack… If the animation get’s done you won’t be able to use it unless it’s hard coded in and I cannot do that. But the infomation will be in the new model and an idle animation also</p>
<p>So My Project goals have shifted now due to some enlightenment about what can and cannot be done</p>
<p>Things done so far have a  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>1 Better Animated Crowbar primary HL1 secondary attack / idle anims<br>
2.Shotgun with a stock reskin<br>
3. Half Life 2 Grenades but reskinned and have HL2 physics  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
4. Headcrab physics the same as HL2  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
5. Relevant sound and skin improvements i.e. modeldetailfx proxy<br>
6. Change the crosshair to HL2 styled crosshair on some weapons<br>
7. 357 with wooden handle and smoking nose particle effect Update existing particle?</p>
<p>Dynamic scopes are not going to be possible to do on the rocket launcher or even a ful screen overlay with right click as contained within source code.</p>

<p>Well you could be right I don’t know either I have a couple of weeks to establish realistic goals or make possible what I can.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>YOU ARE RIGHT</p>
<p>Ok so I will just get the animation improved on the existing model hopegully</p>
<p>If other animations are done then the Devs can code it in if they want them</p>
<p>I am going to try working on getting the proxies set-up on some textures and do some sounds but the crowbar I don’t think is an issue I hope and can atleast be improved</p>
<p>And I also need a compiler realisticly who can decompile models properly too</p>
<p>basically I need to learn fast</p>

<p>Why is that…anything I cannot do I cannot do…</p>
<p>Like I said the main goal is The crowbar even if it falls short at that which it has not already then fair enough.</p>
<p>What do I need the source code for on that list?</p>
<p>probably the AR2 import…</p>
<p>The rest can be done through the script files?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ok I am trying to start a project to essentially improve the crowbar and some other things but the crowbar is the primary goal at the momment achieved a few things on my list but need advice and help</p>
<p>I have a friend who is a professional animator who has worked on harry potter and with Sony and he is going to have a go at animating the crow bar in Maya as a favour.</p>
<p>He has told me he has not the time for the next couple of weeks but he wants to have a go at it for fun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I need someone who can code and probably fairly well so a volunteer help would be welcome…</p>
<p>And I also need some advice on Textures… and basically adding strings in VTF Edit can anyone help point me in the right direction for either of these points?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Serious project yes absolutley</p>
<p>Whats it about?</p>
<p>general Improvement to weapons and game play mechanics and Visual and sound enhancement where possible More HL2 than HL in terms of some mechanics in others not more like the original but not losing what black mesa has re-imagined.</p>
<p>Things done so far have a  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>1 Better Animated Crowbar primary HL1 secondary attack / idle anims<br>
2.Shotgun with a stock reskin or New Model Possible lamarrs shotgun redux but texture and sprites and sound updated<br>
3.IOut the MP5 and import the AR2 and skin an M4 instead ontop<br>
4. Half Life 2 Grenades but reskinned and have HL2 physics  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
5. Headcrab physics the same as HL2  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
6. Crossbow dynamic scope fix make smoother?<br>
7. Relevant sound and skin improvements  i.e. modeldetailfx proxy<br>
8. Change the crosshair to HL2 styled crosshair on some weapons<br>
10. 357 with wooden handle and smoking nose particle effect<br>
11. Rocket launcher with a dynamic scope</p>
<p>And that is all I want to do for the pack as a basis.</p>
<p>And that is what I want to accomplish</p>
<p>any subs or help greatly appreciated</p>

<p>I swear some of you people on this forum don’t know how to look at an example and not take it for face value. I didn’t say “The crowbar is shit because there wasn’t a cool intro.” I stated an example of what could’ve happened, not necessarily what should’ve happened. And again, it was just an example. It’s not like I’m in any place to produce anything to showcase what I mean, which is why I civilly outlined what I thought was wrong and followed up with suggestions.</p>
<p>Ever hear of constructive criticism? My OP is how you do it. Not jumping on the “omg BMS is perfect” bandwagon. It’s far from and this entire subsection of the forums was dedicated to that effort.</p>
<p>I like the idea of the HL2 crowbar. Would just like to see something new and original, if that’s possible, since the rest of BMS has a very ‘built-from-the-ground-up’ feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then what the hell were you talking about when referring to it being “lazily implemented”? If it’s just the animations, then that’s already been discussed to death. And even if it isn’t, what else would a long metal stick have going for it besides just hitting things? Giving it too much power could disrupt the balance of the game somewhat. It’s perfectly fine as a tool for breaking things and killing headcrabs.</p>
<p>Also, if you’ve seen me post before, then you’d know that I know all about constructive criticism. Not once have I claimed that BMS is perfect. I’ve criticized and nitpicked the shit out of it. Stop jumping to conclusions.</p>

<p>They weren’t being lazy, they just decided not to overdo it. Why does it need a super fancy introductory animation? It’s a crowbar. It’s a long metal stick that you hit things with. True, it’s the “iconic” weapon of the series, but that doesn’t mean that it needs to rain confetti from the ceiling when you get it.</p>
<p>Plus, the way you get it in BM is a very hectic moment in which you’re attacked about two seconds after picking it up. An introductory animation would only take away from the moment. Acquiring the crowbar is treated as a heat-of-the-moment survival decision, rather than the discovery of the holy grail.</p>
<p>However it does deserve more fluid and powerful looking animations.</p>

            <p>Well I think A community project might be in order for this and would like to get this started what do you think about these ideas? As a basis for a project</p>
<p>1 Better Animated Crowbar (or Original HL2 or other well animated crowbar)<br>
2.Shotgun with a stock<br>
3.Improved MP5 animations or import the AR2 and skin an M4 instead ontop<br>
4.Half Life 2 Grenades<br>
5. Headcrab physics the same as HL2<br>
6. Crossbow zoom/scoped the same as HL2 but with BM overlay<br>
7. Relevant sound and skin improvements<br>
8. Change the crosshair to HL2 crosshair</p>
<p>Going to speak to my mate he uses 3dstudio max and is a graphic designer see if he knows about this stuff and animation… Also he really loves his first person shooters so he might be interested</p>

            <p>Just rename the files and copy them over I wouldn’t recommend it though the fov won’t work properly and the hand textures get screwed up.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>how did you get it too appear?</p>
<p>did you copy the hands over aswell?</p>
<p>Heres a good list of things I would like to see a MOD for</p>
<p>1 Better Animated Crowbar (or Original HL2 or other well animated crowbar)<br>
2.Shotgun with a stock<br>
3.Improved MP5 animations or import the AR2 and skin an M4 instead ontop<br>
4.Half Life 2 Grenades<br>
5. Headcrab physics the same as HL2<br>
6. Crossbow zoom/scoped the same as HL2 but with BM overlay<br>
7. Relevant sound and skin improvements<br>
8. Change the crosshair to HL2 crosshair</p>
<p>This would be the dogs if these things can be changed or implemented</p>
<p>I’d call any MOD that can do this BOB (Best of Both)</p>

            <p>Nice idea!</p>
<p>The problem we have now aswell… Well, it seems like the crowbar always wants to hit above the enemies…</p>
<p>Try it with the boxes aswell, sometimes u can’t even break them</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Exactly the point of this thread… Room for improvement with the animation.</p>
<p>I read the wiki and it stated about secondary attack idea dropped due to balance issues. I don’t know what the original intention of the secondary attack was but here are my thoughts on the crowbar and how it can be improved.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Left clicking with the crow bar will make the crowbar swing left and right and is the quickest attack (keep the attack speed and damage intact from BMS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right clicking with the crowbar will  first show you the left hand reach out before seeing the crowbar come down over head swing motion. This attack deals a bit bore damage but requires timing as it takes longer to execute. If you are attacked during trying to do the overhead swing it will cancel the attack. this attack will gib dead enemies too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.Idle animation Patting the end of the crowbar into the empty left hand</p>

<p>However I stand by my original statement, that indeed, the crowbar is “lazily represented” compared to the rest of BMS. Something I found odd given the iconic nature of said crowbar.</p>
<p>Quick example for clarification-- I don’t remember the original pistol from HL1 having any feeling of power as a direct result of the sound quality, or a cool fippy spin idle animation, but I have that feeling and animation in BMS-- a clear improvement from the original. Why was the crowbar kept at the exact same quality as the original, if not at least the same quality as the one from HL2? Why was there no cool introductory animation when you first found it, as if greeting a long lost friend, a simple and fun ode to the players who’ll be exploring BMS?</p>
<p>I didn’t bash any other part of the game. I didn’t say it was bad. It’s pretty fucking fantastic, enough that I’ve been telling all of my friends who own a laptop and desktop to go download it and enjoy.</p>

</aside>
<p>They weren’t being lazy, they just decided not to overdo it. Why does it need a super fancy introductory animation? It’s a crowbar. It’s a long metal stick that you hit things with. True, it’s the “iconic” weapon of the series, but that doesn’t mean that it needs to rain confetti from the ceiling when you get it.</p>
<p>Plus, the way you get it in BM is a very hectic moment in which you’re attacked about two seconds after picking it up. An introductory animation would only take away from the moment. Acquiring the crowbar is treated as a heat-of-the-moment survival decision, rather than the discovery of the holy grail.</p>
<p>However it does deserve more fluid and powerful looking animations.</p>

<p>It’s a far-off statement to say <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> in BMS is done lazily. The game is being considered AAA content by reviews across the board, and given the strides of effort and talent that was necessary to complete it, it’s truly astonishing to see what’s been provided.</p>
<p>However I stand by my original statement, that indeed, the crowbar is “lazily represented” compared to the rest of BMS. Something I found odd given the iconic nature of said crowbar.</p>
