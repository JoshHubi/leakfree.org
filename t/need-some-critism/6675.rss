    <title>Need some critism</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-some-critism/6675</link>
    <description>Knowing how critical you guys are I thought I would share a piece of writing I&#39;m working on. It&#39;s far from done, and I need a lot of advice. Here are a few things I need help on:

1. How should I start this?
2. What should I get ride of/remove?
3. What should I add?
4. What sounds good, and what doesn&#39;t? 
5. How can I find a writing style that truly fits me (as I&#39;m borrowing from many different authors)? 

Please try to stay constructive... I don&#39;t need people telling me it sucks, but rather what you don&#39;t like about it. It&#39;s not a project or anything, I just enjoy writing. Here&#39;s what I have so far:

Long passed in the former world, before the gray brick lighthouse was precariously suspended on the rock-strewn peninsula, followed by this then erected into port and township. Long before the first man set foot onto the sandy beaches, and set in motion establishment. 

True, it had been long sense the island called out in its mysterious lore, sending bright its audible token straight into the airwaves, meeting with the cool air, and emitting for the world to behold a demonstration of likely magnificence. For it called, and the black rocks listened, it called, and the trees sang, it called, and the wind whistled. But, by and by, year after year, the rocks stopped listening and forgot how to hear, the trees stopped singing and forgot even the simplest note, and the wind stopped whistling, and forgot how to squeeze but a blow from cheek.

Never the less, not a year had gone – nor had the subtle silhouette of hollowed trees eroded in the gut of beetle distorted in position from former passing by the cosmic alignment - with the intention that of the beacon not transmitting its ancient sign. It sent out, like a torch shining brightly beside the tide. And year after year, the dirt trails had forgotten the passerby’s of creature. The wooden oak, with routs long plunged into the plot amidst the Hebrides had sense, befitting their worn old age, began to mold, reduce, and decay into only that which would be suitable of smaller and less minded beings. 

The signal called; however, there was none from this consign to rejoin its arid message but the forlorn, dry airstream drifting, by and by, amidst the cliffs and black rocks littering the zone.  Even the lifeless, flaccid, and elderly foliage long sense forgotten about the white noise. A sad omniscient tone bounced from the moldy wreck amidst the coast, through the innards of the hermit, and gull.</description>

<p>easily one of the most purple things i’ve read in a long time, and i read lovecraft on a daily basis. no wait, that sounds like a compliment. lemme rephrase that… lovecraft is arabesque. you are purple.</p>
<p>like somebody else said, you use wayyy too much metaphor. i’m not even sure what idea you were trying to get at. something about something being old or a description of a rock or something. it’s really not good. go read something by authors who express things more concretely and make another attempt. suggestions: bukowski, hemingway, bradbury, vonnegut.</p>
<p>tl;dr: your biggest problem is over expressing things. short sentences. convey through tone rather than description.</p>

            <p>Way to many adjectives and foreign words. Though I understand most, people these days, espically youth, don’t understand stuff like that. If you’re borrowing from Lovecraft or Shakespeare; don’t. You need to read a more modern books to get a better sense of wording.<br>
"Nor had the subtle silhouette of hollowed trees eroded in the gut of beetle distorted in position from former passing by the cosmic alignment. "</p>
<p>If I read that sentence in any book I would put it down due to lack of imagination. You overdue detail, use simplier words. I don’t even understand that sentence and Lovecraft is my Author of choice.</p>

            <p>I missed Maxey. He is like a radiant heater: Hot, but no flames.</p>
<p>My only advice: write as much as you can and read it aloud.<br>
If YOU don’t feel connected to the text while you are reading it aloud, chances are nobody else will.</p>

            <p>Yeah, how do you plan to be a writer if you can’t type “criticism” properly?</p>
<p>Oh god that felt good. Had to wait almost a week to finally post this.</p>

            <p>It has a bit of the old Lovecraftian “adjectivitis” and it reads like you sat there writing it with a thesaurus in hand – almost to the extent of being unintentionally funny.</p>
<p>So yeah, it has purple prose syndrome like someone above said. There was only one Poe and one Dunsany and no one else should probably write in that style again, lest it seem corny.</p>
<p>Sorry, I don’t really have any specific critiques on what could be done to change it. I just don’t think that that style of writing is effective any more, and it hasn’t been for about 80 years.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
