    <title>So I got hit by a car.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-i-got-hit-by-a-car/4695</link>
    <description>While longboarding yesterday I was going down the sidewalk of a fairly busy street and a guy who wasn&#39;t looking pulled out in front of me as he was leaving a restaurant.

I went over the hood of the car then landed on my feet unscathed.

My longboard didn&#39;t fair so well.

Before, with fresh paint-job 2 years ago

After being run over by car:

However, the guy who hit me did give me the $150 or so to buy a new longboard.</description>

            <p>I think I’ve avoided about three collisions on my way home from/to work. All while I was riding on the side of the road on my bike. Two were near sideswipes (within INCHES), one was a Truck delivering Ice nearly ran into me around a turn (Truck driver Had no excuse, I had a red, fluttering rain poncho on, and If I hadn’t turned into the grass there, I wouldn’t be here typing this). Then again these Incidents all happened on a Well-traveled Suburban road and WOULDN’T have happened if there were sidewalks on the Northern half of said road.</p>

            <p>yeah, anytime a car hits a person (anywhere) it is a collision regardless of how damaged the person is.  broken or no, if the car drives away, it is now a hit and run.  Serious repercussions if you press it legally.</p>

            <p>Good thing you’re okay. Very sorry about the board though, I know what that’s like. About 2 years ago I had a board given to me by a pro, which I thought was Bad ass. About a month later, I decided to skate around a park (A regular park, not a skate park). On my way back, Some idiot that was texting wasn’t paying attention to the road, and almost hit me. I was stupid enough to jump <span class="bbcode-u">up</span> off the skateboard, instead of off to the <span class="bbcode-u">side</span>. I landed on the hood, my wrist cracked the windshield and his tires cracked the damn board… I was pissed enough to roll off the hood, yell “What the hell you fucking idiot!?” throw the dettached truck from the skateboard at him (I missed and hit his door, which pissed me off more) and walk away holding my wrist because that hurt.</p>
<p>Yes I did just walk off after that, I was pissed that the board destroyed and that the idiot almost hit me… Glad I at least got that dent in his door through, wish it hit his hand holding the door though…</p>

<p>So, I was hit by a car about ten years ago.  I was walking home from the mall (I lived in an apartment complex across the street from one) and was entering the drive going to the complex.  I was on the sidewalk at the time.  This is an important bit of info.</p>
<p>A red car came out of a side-parking lot like a bat out of hell, squealing its wheels and jumped up the curb onto the sidewalk, the car side-swiping me on the driver’s side, my body scraping down the entire length of the car.  Had a rather nasty friction burn on the side and I was so dazed that I never found out who did it.  All I do know is that the driver was a middle-aged woman cradling a cellphone with one hand and flipping me off with the other as she drove off for getting my body in the way of her car, apparently.</p>

<p>I once hit a kid on a bike. Nobody was hurt but it scared the hell out of me.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, same happened to me. In my defense, he was riding the wrong way down the street while I was turning around a corner with a giant hedge on it. So it wasn’t really my fault, but I paid him for his bike anyway cause I felt bad.</p>
