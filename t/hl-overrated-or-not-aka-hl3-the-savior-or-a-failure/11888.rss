    <title>HL: overrated or not, aka. HL3 the savior or a failure?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl-overrated-or-not-aka-hl3-the-savior-or-a-failure/11888</link>
    <description>To keep it short, do you think (all bias aside) it really is good in terms of gameplay even now, or it only was when it came out, but now it&#39;s outdated?
Some may even say it was bad back in 2004, and got praised only thanks to hype, then groundbreaking engine, and because many fans wanted a sequel... In terms of story as well, I saw comments about how it&#39;s a joke to introduce characters out of nowhere and make them with Gordon know each other, retconning pretty much everything, with: &quot;yeah, these are few of those generic looking NPC from HL1, given backgrounds and history, accept it&quot; + mute protagonist, random antagonists and the G-man, random character with purpose and ambitions unknown, being neither good or evil, whatever Valve think about, aka. guaranteed sales for those many who want to know the &quot;mystery&quot; that might not even exist.

Come to think of it, most of HL1 is fun enough but some parts of HL2 are very boring to some people, despite being more &quot;cinematic and actiony&quot; (being chased and stuff)
With these being said, I don&#39;t have an idea how do the guys at Valve want to stay relevant with HL3... HL2 brought more open environments, more varied enemy encounters, physics, vehicles, advanced AI partners, but the weapons alone were bland and boring imo.

So the questions are:
-is the series really worthy of being thought of as the third coming of videogame revolution? What if we are going to be disappointed?
Not to set up a fire, but I think it&#39;s a possibility that people don&#39;t believe in it&#39;s success, rather are amused with the thought of a vaporware blowing mind of everyone.
-what changes do you think Valve has in store?
-what are your expectations?

I will start, I think they should say good bye to City 17 and drastically change the setting, the initially thought Episode Three&#39;s arctic placement sounds interesting to me.
Also more realistic, fun to shoot and varied weapons, and please, no &quot;plastic&quot; appearance nor sounds.
Less loading times, and I&#39;m sold.... so that&#39;s it, no trolling, be civil.</description>

            <p>Yeah, the vitriol and flaming  and the strange discussion of robot on rebel forbidden love. All gone by the wayside because of newly empowered mods. Remember the salad days of the forum, two or three unbacked up  crashes ago, when the lead developer was the most vitriolic, flame spewing person here. Yeah, those were the good ol’ days. new members would come along and say something incredibly stupid, and then the citizens of the BMS forums would rise in unison to dispense fiery justice.  Yeah, those were the days…</p>

            <p>I loved (and still love) HL2 to bits.  It was an amazing game for me when it came out and I loved every moment of it.  I always thought of Half-Life 2 as a game that isn’t really centered around the weapons but more to the point of exploring.  And that was one thing I really loved in HL2 and it was going on a massive journey and when you think back the beginning of the game felt like ages ago.  These days games don’t give me and feeling of accomplishment and that sense of journey like HL2 did.  I love everything about the game: the weapons, the sounds, the atmosphere but it’s probably because I was young when it came out and, being very little when I played HL1, it was like an old friend.</p>
<p>To the topic of HL3.  I hope VALVe has something amazing up their sleeves because one signature thing of the HL franchise was Gordons HEV suit and how it protects you.  If I’m not mistaken, HL was about the first game to really use the concept of a suit keeping you alive.  But now, and I’m not comparing’ if you look at a game like Crysis, it boils down to the same concept, a suit keeping you alive, and the suit allow for a lot more stuff than the HEV suit does.  So something will have to change in the franchise if they are going to make a ground breaking game again.</p>

<p>Plenty of stuff present in the Half-Life 2 leak is in the final game. There are City 17 maps that are still intact, Ravenholm is very similar between proto and final, stuff like that. Things that were cut weren’t cut due to the leak, but because they were cut during development anyways.</p>
<p>Levels like the Air Exchange or the Borealis were axed before the leak, even though you can still find at least one Borealis map in the proto. There’s plenty of stuff in the proto that was cut earlier on in development, but hadn’t yet been removed.</p>

<p>“It had a release date of September 2003, but was delayed. This pushing back of Half-Life 2’s release date came in the wake of the cracking of Valve’s internal network through a null session connection to Tangis which was hosted in Valve’s network and a subsequent upload of an ASP shell, resulting in the leak of the game’s source code on the Internet in early September 2003.“</p>

<p>No. The content that was cut was not cut because of the leak. Valve has specifically stated as much.</p>
<p>In any case, it would be idiotic if a leak were reason to change anything except your security. Crysis 2 was leaked when it was in a more or less complete state and they didn’t change anything.</p>

            <p>HL2 was Leaked they had to change it. But that point falls more on Ep2 where the teaser trailer was way diferent from the final game (Alyx falling from a bridge, a blue Atlion king, diferent forest, etc)</p>
