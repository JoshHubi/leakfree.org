            <p>yup, and EA actually owns Bioware and DICE. So they are not in a contract. They are just part of EA and they can’t do anything about it short of just leaving the company and starting their own. But they can’t take their game IPs with them. They would have to make new games. Mass Effect and Battlefield franchise are owned by EA.</p>

            <p>I remember it was a merge cause one bought the another… so I went to check out the companies history on wikipedia and found out that Blizzard was bought by vivendi in 1994, before they even had released warcraft, starcraft and diablo franchises… then in 2007 vivendi bought activision and merged both creating activision blizzard, so basically it wasnt a decision made by blizzard itself</p>

            <p>Which makes me wonder why Blizzard teamed up with Activision.<br>
It’s not as though Blizzard needs extra cash when WoW brings them in more money each month than some African countries see in a year.</p>

            <p>If you’ve read Valve’s Employee Handbook, you will notice the emphasys on “Valve is self funded” aspect…</p>
<p>making games requires too much money to begin with, so studios usually make agreements with publishers to get money early to fund the game, which in turn, bind the studios with obligations toward the publisher… like having to release on promised date no matter how buggy and unpolished the game may be, or to cut content from game to realease as a 0 day dlc (or post 1 month dlc), or having to produce 1 title a year for the franchise for the next 7 years (and hence stop working on patches at all), or even making shit endings just to sell a different ending as dlc</p>
<p>and this turns into a vicious circle, cause since they took money early, publishers will take a take big part of the profits, hence, studios wont have enough money for the next game, which will make them get money with publishers again and so on…</p>
<p>self funded studios like valve can just say “when it’s done”, they don’t have suck dicks from EA/activision/ubisoft like most studios do… so, basically u can blame the publisher on most of the games issues nowadays</p>

<p>I would be very interested to know just how much power EA has over Bioware.  Do they really call the shots or are they a convenient scapegoat for when Bioware fuck up?<br>
Everybody is very quick to blame EA for all of Bioware’s mistakes, but I wonder how many they are actually responsible for.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m thinking a little of both. I’m sure EAs calling a lot (if not all) of the shots, but their cheap and downright laziness has influenced Bioware I think. So, it’s not just EA saying, “No, you do this.” Biowares pretty much gone full EA now, too. Like for instance, in the PC version of Mass Effect there’s a glitch that makes Garrus’ face really low res and Bioware said it would take like a multi gig patch just to fix it. (with no other explanation whatsoever)</p>
<p>Some guy on Moddb fixed it with a couple megabyte patch.</p>
<p>So, yes. At times I think people just point their finger at EA because they don’t want to believe Biowares selling out their fans, and want to think EA is the big, bad, company, who’s holding them hostage and won’t let them make good games.</p>

            <p>I didn’t have a PC that could run it at the time, and I would never buy that steaming pile again, even if it is supposed to be better.  The changes I know about between PC and consoles (more enemies on PC…why, exactly?) wouldn’t fix my main problems with the core game.</p>

<p>If you think it’s bad on PC you would’ve <span class="bbcode-i">hated</span> it on Xbox.</p>
<p>Unless you played it on Xbox in which case yes, I totally agree.</p>

<p>2.25/3 of the recent BioWare games I’ve bought have been shit.</p>
<p>I’m not defending EA, but ever since BioWare has gone over to EA, they have put out bad games.</p>
<p>The games I’m talking about are Dragon Age 2, SWTOR, and Mass Effect 3.  DA2 was unnecessary with no improvements to the bad combat other than making it faster.  SWTOR bit off more than it could chew, the stories were mostly good, but the gameplay was a huge step back from their biggest competitor, which is 7 years older.  ME3 is great so far, but I’m reluctant to beat it because of what I’ve read and heard about the ending.</p>
<p>tl;dr BioWare is getting worse, if it’s their own doing or EA’s corruption spreading, I don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Did you even PLAY Dragon Age: Origins? The combat is perfectly fine the way it was, DA2 even made combat a lot worse. Your criticisms make it sound like you didn’t even play the game, or if you did, you must have sucked. Badly. Also, they released DA2 not to make improvements, but to further the main story line, but I’m sure story is irrelevant to you.</p>
<p>Edit: No, I didn’t like DA2 half as much as DA:O.</p>
