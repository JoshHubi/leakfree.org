    <title>Steam: scanning for games updates. FOR EVER</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-scanning-for-games-updates-for-ever/4437</link>
    <description>Ok so i just updated steam and restarted it like it told me too. Now the problem is that when i am trying to start a game, any game, it tells me that it is &quot;scanning for steam games updates&quot; and it just says that without end, the game does not launch. Also when i try to click some were else it makes a noise that reminds me of the Wii console and doesnt let me do anything unless cancel the scan. WTF is going on i wanna play through Dangerous World mod again and this shit happens. :&#39;(</description>

            <p>Yeah it happens a lot to me to, usually when I reinstall steam. Try restarting steam, usually it resumes updating. Don’t know if it works but it solves my problems.</p>
