    <title>Project: Mod in a week // Giving new life to and old pc case</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/project-mod-in-a-week-giving-new-life-to-and-old-pc-case/7276</link>
    <description>So I´ve posted this in a couple of specialised forums and I actually finished it yesterday, but I though you guys might enjoy it so here goes:


Hi Everyone,

As the title says, I have decided to do a full project (mostly painting) in a week. I will be using my first ever non-beige computer case that recently came back to my possesion. (I had given the pc to my sister around 8 years ago and she finally got a new one). I originally bought the case around 10 years ago and was my first self built PC.

You might be asking, But Luciel, why use that old piece of crap when you could be using an awesome modern case? Well, I would say nostalgia and a way of getting back to my roots and &quot;upgrading&quot; them to my current skills.

I have no idea of what the case´s brand or model is, I bought it in a computer fair in the UK back then when the whole pre-modded case market was starting.

The idea came to me last night (or, this night if you´re picky about it technically being the same day) when I was lying in bed from 3am till 7am with no success in sleeping (Spain) is bloody hot right now at nights. So I decided to get up, get down to my workbench and start it up.

I will continue the log as soon as I upload the pictures (on a rather embarrasingly slow connection here) and detail everything I´ve been doing. Enough to say I have dismantled the old crappy hardware inside it (although the ASUS A7N8X-E was pretty epic bac then) and the case itself, cleaned it as best I could (the age really shows) and will proceed to sand it as soon as the shops open ( it´´s 8.45am here) and I can get some sanding paper! and prepare it for paint which hopefully I will start today.

The hardware that´s going to be used in this build is the following:
eVGA 790i Ultra SLI
Q6600
4x2 DDR3 1600 Corsair ram (yes I know it will create a bottleneck, but this are second hand parts I have laying about).
2x GTX275
3x Seagate SATA2 750Gb
1x dvd rewriter
1x memory card reader
Thermaltake bigwater b770 CPU wc system
SB X-FI platinum pro

I will also be ordering an MCP water block as the mcp in this board gets notoriously hot in SLI configs (right under one of the cards)

I will also be painting the gpus, sound card, hdds, and dvd drive casing to go with the design.

This system will be replacing my current main PC (the fallout case project shown in this sites case gallery, which, if anyone´s interested I´ll be selling, just the case) As my P67 asus board is being RMA´d so will be using the LGA 775 for now, and I will sorely miss my i5 2500k).

Agasin, I will be updating this thread with info and pictures of the whole process as the day goes by (I need to buy everything needed this morning as my car will be in the garage for a week getting fixed and re-sprayed).

As a last message for now, I encourage anyone to try the one week mod challenge, It´s not my first time and it can be a lot of fun : ) (even if its just to ebay it afterwards).

Thanks in advanced for all comments and suggestions : =)

//

It´s now 11am, I just got back from leaving the car at the garage, and apparently I may get it back before the end of the week (awesome)! But more importantly, I got back from buying the paint, and other supplies I needed for this project.

So, here it goes (excuse the crappy camera, I have already asked a friend for his much better camera that he will bring down tomorrow):

I went down to my work-area and, admitedly, I hadn´t been down there for a while, as most computer related work I´ve done in my room recently as I´ve had nothing major. Problem with this kind of thing is that, if you need to store something, you end up putting it there and thing, ah I´ll sort it out when I need space to work (lol, yeah right).

![](upload://wNsZ60Pd0A7sdrEb1FkgJwheLKm.jpeg)

![](upload://gdzVutxdphvDs46ExSbtkhsVrAo.jpeg)

So, rather than actually try and sort things out (it´s 7.30am!!!!!!!!) I figured I´d just &quot;relocate&quot; stuff off the workbench.

Sorted...

![](upload://ttL6UOj6uokObTxkNiiD3jZUyTl.jpeg)

So here is the case, with the original pc still in it, now, as you can see, it´s not in the best of shapes and it´s had a hell of a lot of use and while it has been taken more or less care off, 10 years doesn´t do any favours to a pc tower.

![](upload://a9OpFN1bdmbBlgRYjWL7CtE5QIk.jpeg)

![](upload://nMui1ECwsIje6zfSkjLMGkhUync.jpeg)

So, first thing, dismantle the whole thing and... most likely throw away that old hardware, most of it is on it´s way out aniway.

![](upload://hVgQCECUjkjntDHnnm0bQXUr0eG.jpeg)

Dirty, let´s clean the whole thing up.

![](upload://xMDu298ZoVYdR6KHGuGzrLaFVbM.jpeg)

Well, that´s as clean as it´s going to get, at least the chasis, I will be sanding (is that the right word?) down all the panels and getting them ready for painting. I shall be doing this as soon as I press submit reply on this post.

On the side window I have opted to get rid of the acrylic, which is in really bad shape (brown with smoke and scratched to hell). I could replace it with some left over acrylic I had from another project, but I´m really liking the idea of mesh (i´ve used it before for a sidepanel and loved the look, the only downside is that the insides aren´t as visible as with acrylic, although I guess I could try and find some really fine mesh, any suggestions on this?

Until later!</description>

            <p>I bought it at my local paint suplies shop, the brand in question is 4CR and they do it with a machine they have there, as far as I know, you insert the colour code in to the machine and it mixes inks to achieve this color and then water + some other stuff, puts it in a can (if you use spray cans) or in a container (if you use compressor). It´s essentially sold as paint for cars, so if you ask for such at your local shop, that is the ideal kind of paint for this kind of job, not only the acrylic part, I.E. not afecting heatsink capabilities and such like plastic paints, but also the durability and strenght of it, but of course, you pay the price, it´s quite expensive, it works out a lot cheaper if you use a compressor as that way you´re not paying for the aerosol and can which, is, in my shop´s case, 35-40% of the price.</p>
<p>Within this there´s several types, I´ll translate as best I can, but this may not be the right names in english (I´m used to their spanish counterparts), mono-coat is as basic and cheap as it gets in this area of paint, but it requires a primer before it and lacquer after. Dual-Coat requires no primer, but the surface must be sanded and perfectly clean, it also requires lacquer, Tri-coat is the same as Dual-coat but it has more componentes, depending in the type, to achieve for example a metallic effect like on modern day car, other effects inlude pearl, and so on, it does however, still require lacquer. There are some variations that already incluce lacquer, like for alloy wheels, I´ve never trusted these though, as it´s never as strong as aplying lacquer afterwards.</p>

            <p>About an hour of fiddling tbh. I had to change the psu and put it outside the case in order to fit in 4 hard drives, and because I wanted that psu for something else. I got it all from a skip.</p>

<p>Sure, you can start by finding a logo you like, go to a printing shop and ask for, sticky vynil sheet (in a4 size), you take it home, you print your logo on to this, stick the full sheet to your computer, with a cutter, cut around the logo, take those bits off, spray away (very important you use acrilic based paint, also make sure the surface is extra clean). Then leave for a couple of hours to dry, remove vynil, tadaá your first mod : )</p>

<p>If you haven’t thrown out the old parts yet, I’ll consider buying them for cheap (read: pay for you to ship them out to me). I need old parts for an HTPC haha.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, and I should probably tell you that your mod is bloody amazing. I’d imagine you get a good profit selling your mods on eBay.</p>

</aside>
<p>I´m afraid someone else has claimed them (and offered me 50€ on top of paying for postage so…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  also, there was no hard drive (it was dead)</p>
<p>I do sell them, more basic mods, just outside paint and stuff but doesn´t make much. for example, this particular mod (if we dont take all the hardware in mind), has been around 100€ worthed of paint and other materials needed, like sanding paper, masking tape, lacquer, etc), plus around 20-25 hours of work, even at minimum wage of 5€, that´s like 100€ minimum, so that´s already 200€, plus the case which I already had… you get the picture, not many people want to pay 300€ for JUST a case, so it prooved hard to sell on ebay, it´s easier to post it in the adecuate forums, like for example, I will soon sell my previous mod since I´m now using this one.</p>

<p>Also, about the spec, it´s been answered, but I will be upgrading sometime in the next week or two, to an ASUS P8P67 PRO (or EVO haven´t decided yet) and an i5 2500k, with liquid cooling should be able to raise it to 4.8Ghz.</p>

</aside>
<p>Go for it!! I´ll be happy to help you out if you need any advice : )</p>
<p>About the hot part, yes, with the fan at 80% (on the second hard) it´s fine when gaming, but it prooved quite noise, when I upgrade the mobo and cpu I think I will take the chance to add higuer feet and make a hole on the bottom big enough for 2x12cm so they will be dedicated to cooling that card. This way, it can remain quiet, as the other fans are rather quiet (love cooler master fans).</p>
<p>I did for a while look for decent water coolers for the gpus but unfortunately the 275 doesn´t seem to be a popular model, there´s plenty of choice for the 260, 280, 285, and 295, just not the 275 : /</p>
