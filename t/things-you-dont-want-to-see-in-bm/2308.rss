    <title>Things you DON&#39;T want to see in BM.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/things-you-dont-want-to-see-in-bm/2308</link>
    <description>Yeah yeah yeah, we&#39;ve read &#39;em all; things we WANT in Black Mesa. Helmets, mirrors, retcon character references, etc. in the last several months i don&#39;t think there&#39;s been any suggestions posted that haven&#39;t been posted before.

So i propose we start a new fantasy list : [b]Things you [i]DON&#39;T[/i] want in Black Mesa![/b]

---

- in the opening chapters if the game, if i hear any scientist ask, &quot;Having fun yet, Gordon?&quot; i&#39;m going to lose it. Everybody says this to the newest hire in EVERY job. i don&#39;t care if you&#39;re stocking freight at your local Wal-Mart or managing a small team of production assistants, at every job there&#39;s always one jackoff that asks, &quot;Having fun yet&quot;, every. freaking. day.

- Fourth-wall breaking wordage regarding &quot;health&quot;, &quot;guns&quot;, &quot;pressing USE keys&quot; or any other jargon commonly read in videogame manuals, tutorials or out-of-game discussion. Real world references like Metal Gear Solid ARE FiNE! i just don&#39;t want the &#39;wall broken by accident a la Episode:Two.

- Every GoldSource game had the same stock sound effects for PC movement. Footstep sounds were terrible in the original Half-Life and thanks to the popularity of CounterStrike, i came to HATE the sound of boots on gravel. No matter what surface Gordon&#39;s boots touch, it either crumbles beneath the weight of his feet ( [i]*CRUNCH* *crunch* *CRUNCH* *crunch*[/i] ) or -[i]oddly enough[/i]- squeaks and creeks. Either the tiles of Black Mesa&#39;s floors are affixed to their foundation with springs or their maintenance staff needs to switch to a thicker floor wax. A quick sprint across the hall always sounds like a college basketball game. if Gordon&#39;s feet are going to squeak that much, i want to turn around to see some black sole marks! Thank God this is the Source Engine.

- if guards and HECU are supposed to be weapons experts, make them SOUND like it. There&#39;s a clear and obvious difference between, &quot;[url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)#What_to_call_it.3F&#39;]magazines[/url]&quot; and &quot;[url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clip_(ammunition)&#39;]clips[/url]&quot;. That being said, i AM NOT A WEAPONS EXPERT, nut, fanatic, enthusiast or collector . i don&#39;t even own a real gun and i know the difference. Hollywood ALWAYS screws this up. Please please PUH-LEASE get it right in Black Mesa.

---

Obviously the game&#39;s been in production for a while, it should be out soon and it&#39;s way too late to start removing features and the like from the game. Nobody should expect any of this to be taken seriously. it&#39;s a list of items to post, discuss and pass the time. A list of realistic expectations. A list of off-the-wall annoyances. A list for the hopeful, the impatient and the totally bored.

Have fun and feel free to post anything.

<p>Whoops, you’re right. For some reason I thought it was still a 2.5D game.</p>
<p>Anyway, you do need some special renderer or something like that to run DF2 properly on modern machines. Google it.</p>

            <p>Just because Windows Vista and/or Windows 7 aren’t mentioned in the system requirements doesn’t mean that Half-Life won’t run on those systems, you can run almost any game on newer ones. I even played the very first Prince of Persia on Windows XP although it was developed for MS-DOS. So buy it, it will work.</p>

<p>Now how am I going to fix that… Well I guess I shouldn’t as even though Half-Life exists its completely incompatable with any of the recent software… Nah, it sounds stupid the way I put it.</p>

            <p>I’ve been thinking about this for some time now. What I expect from this mod is Half-Life, but not just Half-Life. I expect a Half-Life that I can be Immersed in. The original Half-Life was just too outdated for me to truly appreciate the game.</p>
<p>As for easter eggs, I’d actualy be a bit dissapointed if the game only had a few. I couldn’t blame them though, it’s not a priority… What would be great though is a scientist saying “It will be done when it’s done!” to a colleague.</p>
