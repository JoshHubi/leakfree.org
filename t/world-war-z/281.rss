I&#39;ve been listening to the audio book, I&#39;m on track 62 atm, very interesting book.


People often tell em the part of the battle of yonkers is the best part of the book (a part in which the army fights hordes of the undead only to find there weapons are ineffective to a degree)

Depicted here:

Although I must disagree, it was a good part of the story, although I found the South Africa part of the story the most interesting. In which they depict a man with no ethics to save what was left of the country, a dark part of the story imo, 

Another part of the story was when the woman tells how her whole family heads north to avoid the zombie outbreak, at first it seems to be alright then human natural kicks in, along with the cold, and then drives them all to cannibalism.

the story I probably liked too is the story of the Merc hired to protect the rich from the zombies, but battle of yonkers is above it, this one depicts him as just a hired gun, while the great panic is going on, they sit around in a mansion with other rich friends watching the world falling apart, and then talks about them filming a web show of them throughout this, and him being sicken by this. and then the shit hits the fan.

All the other stories seem to be ok, but its good to have other perspectives I suppose, well off to listen to the rest of the book.

You thoughts on the book?</description>

            <p>If you folks like this book(or audiobook in this case), you should give The Walking Dead indy comics a try.</p>
<p>Max Brooks is a fan of those comics… so is Simon Pegg of wrote a bloody letter to them! How do you like them apples?</p>

            <p>Finished the listening to the book, I know there alot cut from the audio version considering its 6 hours long as it is.</p>
<p>but its enjoyable, the story ending is good was underwhelming, but due to the fact that the book is the end of the story and is retelling the story.</p>

            <p>This looks pretty cool. I’m going to give it a look.</p>
<p>On a side note, do you know of any other good audiobooks? I like stories that focus on the sea. I have a fascination with pirates and that style of story, but I’m not really looking for a typical pirate book. Anything that’s driven like the tracks of <span class="bbcode-i">Right Away, Great Captain!</span> are great; questioning god, love, life, death and revenge while taking on a voyage out at sea.</p>

Man, I need to get this book! It ought’ to be a riot!</p>
<p>Hopefully Max isn’t as bad as his father is now (see “Spaceballs: The Animated Series.” Yes, that show actually exist. I watched about a minute of it on Hulu. Never again.)</p>
