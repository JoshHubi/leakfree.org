    <title>Comparatively low fps in Crysis 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/comparatively-low-fps-in-crysis-2/12461</link>
    <description>So I picked up Crysis 2 with that Humble Bundle, and I actually pirated it before to play it and it seems like I might be having the same problem both times. Now, I watched this video:

[url]https://www.eurogamer.net/videos/crysis-2-1080p-dx11-max-settings-gtx-670-vs-gtx-680-video[/url]

while it was downloading, which is showing that I should be getting a pretty stable 60 fps with my 670 and I&#39;m not. The opening sequence in the video had pretty much no framerate drops while when I was playing it dropped to 50 fps or so a few times. The most noticeable though was when the guy opened the door and is looking over the park, the framerate was solid 60 fps. When I play it my framerate drops to 40-45 fps. 

It doesn&#39;t say what CPU they used for the video though. I would think that my i5 760 @ 3.5GHz should be plenty but I really don&#39;t know. Could driver interference from leftover drivers cause issues like this too? Just want to know why my performance is so much lower.</description>

            <p>I actually found out what was causing the poor performance. The Shader and Object Quality settings take the most framerate. Just lower those down a notch and the game will run great. Game itself is pretty boring though.</p>

            <p>I’ve maxed out my settings to play Crysis 2 and still can’t get high fps. It keeps dropping. My pc should be able to run this. Quite frustrating. I’m wondering if it’s just the game.</p>

            <p>So I downloaded the dx11 patch and HD texture pack. Maybe I’m expecting a bit too much from this game. There’s still flat brick textures and bad textures all over the place. It might have been installed all along and I was just expecting more.</p>
<p>Edit: Although the log says I’m running a 32 bit version of the game when the HD texture pack should enable 64 bit version right?</p>

<p>I can run Crysis 2 at ultra settings and a consistently high framerate on my single-card machine, but, then again, that single card is a GTX 580.  It’s definitely a hardware-thirsty game.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure whether the Steam version has either included by default - maybe the 1.9 patch (which definitely is in the Steam version) enables the UI options for DirectX 11 and Ultra settings without the features actually being available? :retard:</p>
<p>Both installers had some kind of error when they ran (something about “VersionInfo”), and then seemed to complete near-instantly (which seemed odd for a ~560MB patch and ~1.7GB texture pack), but the effects <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4vTQvJx.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">seem to be working fine</a>.</p>

<p>This is helpful. Maybe they were running some black magic in that video. I suppose I can lower the settings a bit and see how that works. Or try overclocking my card a bit.</p>
<p>Edit: I installed Maldo’s texture pack, and the game is running fine for me now, as it comes with its own settings changer. Thing is, it looks like the tessellation isn’t working. All my bricks and tire tracks look flat to me. Maybe I’ll try to reinstall it. Also, with the Steam version do you have to install the DX11 patch and HD texture manually? Because it says I’m using DX11 in the game but I’m not sure if it’s actually working.</p>
<p>Edit 2: It seems to be optional and not included with the Steam version by default. That’s very strange. And I was still getting framerate problems just with the default. Well I’ll probably do a fresh install and install everything else in one go and then see. Maybe that’s why the game wouldn’t start with the dxgi.dll error. Because that’s a file for DX11 and I don’t have it installed  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  .</p>

            <p>Yeah, everything is maxed out, and I’d be fine with it but the video I linked is using the DX11 stuff too maxed out with the exact same card and it getting 20+ fps higher in certain areas for some reason.</p>

            <p>Are you using DX11 + the high res tessellated texture pack on max settings?</p>
<p>If so, it was pretty half-assed and as such runs pretty shitty unless you lower object detail.</p>
<p>I remember looking at tessellated objects in the editor and they literally tessellate everything, even objects that aren’t being manipulated - so what that does is end up creating objects like flat concrete walls that are made up of several hundred faces while the original object was made up of say, only <span class="bbcode-i">two</span>.</p>
<p>It’s really fucking stupid - and to add on to that, Crysis 2’s watter culling, unlike Crysis 1’s - is broken, so it always renders the ocean no matter what, even if the level just has one small area of water and the rest is land.</p>
<p>Normally it’s not a problem, but again, with tessellation enabled the water becomes extremely dense with polys, and they are all being rendered along with the deformation for generating the realistic looking waves all the time.</p>
<p>Of course if you don’t have that enabled, then I’m not sure what the issue is.</p>

            <p>That’s the first thing I did. Most of the answers were updating drivers and shit, which I have checked. Turning off vsync is another commen thing they said to try and that doesn’t make any difference either. According to that video my specs should be getting me 60 fps almost all the time and that’s not happening. I’ve tried most of the stuff suggested when Googling it. That’s why I made this thread.</p>

            <p>So I picked up Crysis 2 with that Humble Bundle, and I actually pirated it before to play it and it seems like I might be having the same problem both times. Now, I watched this video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/videos/crysis-2-1080p-dx11-max-settings-gtx-670-vs-gtx-680-video" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.eurogamer.net/videos/crysis-2-1080p-dx11-max-settings-gtx-670-vs-gtx-680-video</a></p>
<p>while it was downloading, which is showing that I should be getting a pretty stable 60 fps with my 670 and I’m not. The opening sequence in the video had pretty much no framerate drops while when I was playing it dropped to 50 fps or so a few times. The most noticeable though was when the guy opened the door and is looking over the park, the framerate was solid 60 fps. When I play it my framerate drops to 40-45 fps.</p>
<p>It doesn’t say what CPU they used for the video though. I would think that my i5 760 @ 3.5GHz should be plenty but I really don’t know. Could driver interference from leftover drivers cause issues like this too? Just want to know why my performance is so much lower.</p>
