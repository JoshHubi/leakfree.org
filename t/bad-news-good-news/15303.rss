Straight to the bad news: we are pushing back the release of Xen. We are truly sorry for getting everyone&#39;s hopes up and then delaying... again. We worked very hard to make December, but we are not yet ready. As a team, we take FULL responsibility for that. We have an internal deadline we are confident in, and we will be getting everyone more details as we get closer to that date.

Thank you again to our community and Early Access supporters. The funding from Early Access has allowed us to hire many new talented developers, and has allowed older developers to put more time in the project. Simply put, Xen has proven to be an enormous undertaking, and while we are managing it to the best of our ability, it is proving to take longer than we estimated.

The good news is that we will be releasing a large update in December to test all of the new features that have been developed for Xen. We have changed a number of things within the Source Engine, and we want to make sure they all work on the myriad of PCs out there. By enabling the new tech on the Earthbound section of the game, we can get the engine/code fully stabilized on Steam before we drop the final chapters.

[b]In December we will also have an update on where our Xen chapters stand, show some additional media, and deploy the engine update.[/b]

Here are some features that will be in the update:

[b][u]Lens Flare[/u][/b]
We&#39;ve created a custom lens flare entity, and have added lens flares to important light sources in the game. Don’t worry, we will spare your eyes and not go overboard with our new lens flare tech. We think it adds a nice layer of polish to the Earthbound lighting and we hope to use it to really sell the alien feel of Xen... and add endless frustration to the debate about whether or not Gordon wears a helmet.

[b][u]Dynamic Lights[/u][/b]
We’ve shown some dynamic lights in the last update. Here are a few other sections that got the dynamic light treatment. Lights can simply cast light, cast shadows, and even cast volumetric godrays.

[u]Security Joop with Dynamic Lights and Lens Flares[/u]

[u]OAR Rocket Launch with Dynamic Shadows, Light Rays, and a Lens Flare[/u]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/RqrmWXc.gif[/img]

[b][u]4 Way Texture Blends[/u][/b]
We incorporated a 4 way texture blending system like the one seen in Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and improved upon it. Our level designers have 4 texture layers to blend, each with its own bump map and environment map (SSBM OR Normal Bump). Like other versions of the shader, level designers and artists can blend between the 4 layers procedurally using light and dark values of the diffuse textures.

[b][u]Image Based Ambient Lighting[/u][/b]
Lighting can now be generated from the image of the skybox texture. This gives level designers a very quick and accurate base lighting for outdoor maps. The example below has just a light_env in the scene, with no colors. All colored lighting is created automatically from the skybox image.

[b][u]CSM and Godray Performance[/u][/b]
We’ve improved the performance on Cascade Shadow Maps and Godrays and made them both more straightforward to implement on the Hammer side. Godrays are now placed with our newLight_Dir entity and automatically get ray angles from the light_env. Rays not only run better, but look smoother as well.

[u]Environment Light Godrays[/u]

[b][u]Xen Concept Art[/u][/b]
Concepts as seen in [url=&#39;https://www.pcgamer.com/the-story-of-half-life-remake-black-mesa/&#39;]PCGamer[/url]. In addition to the Xen screenshots we have released, these Interloper concepts highlight the difference in environment types we have.

<p>you have dynamic lights now, please re add the light switch to this room. Even if it is just to give the voice actors a few lines. (hate that they removed that little gag from HL :s ource, it and the other two gave a bit of life to the game)</p>
<p>EDIT: beta branch bug reports</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>anytime you kill a garg red X’s spawn around it missing intity errors in consol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in some areas especially the first map of forget about freeman when aliens teleport in the players screen goes completely green making it impossible to see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>through surface tension the ground and air flashes black. (likely a known bug as it is hard to miss)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lambda cores last map spawns a console error related to int_xenturret no clue what that is, doesn’t seem to do anything.</p>
</li>

<p>Will it be dropped before lunch, breakfast or dinner. You can just give the greenwich mean time to save the hastle of converting.<br>
But really, we’ll get it when we get it.</p>

            <h2>^ Thanks for pointing that out. I was thinking the same, when I saw the gif. The internet has an incredible macabre potential of reducing the severest shit to banal memes. But anyway, let’s not assume bad intentions on john’s part.</h2>
<p>For what it’s worth, let’s take the essence of what - I assume - he was trying to say and get back on track here:<br>
I was following the update since it was released but didn’t get around to comment on it. First of all, thanks to the devs for being so open and keeping contact with the community after this unfortunate delay! I personally do not mind the delay, but I do understand the frustration. After all, it did feel like a broken promise. And that is always a big let down, especially when fans get all emotional and personal with a franchise like Half-Life. But there’s way better ways to express said frustration than the incredible salty and hostile and even down-right rascist stuff you see on the steam forums. Though I feel that the majority of the comments are very understanding.</p>
<p>I’m very excited for the changes to the engine. Incredible what you squeeze out of source!</p>
<p>Apart from that, I’d be very interested if the devs are still planning to pursue a mac OS release for Black Mesa after Xen is done. I have windows myself but I am dying to give a copy to a friend of mine!<br>
Thanks and keep up the great work!</p>

            <p>Good God man, don’t commit to that! Have you learned nothing from the Xen delay?</p>
<p>All I can say is I’m staying off the Steam forums December 2117, if you guys miss that deadline it is NOT going to be pretty.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
