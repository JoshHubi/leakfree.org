    <title>A thought about what&#39;s next</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-thought-about-whats-next/15120</link>
    <description>Its really cool that the completion of Black Mesa is in sight.  It got me thinking: If desired, what would be next for Crowbar Collective?

Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if you guys could get Valve&#39;s blessing to make Half Life 3?  I couldn&#39;t think of a more appropriate group.   :wink:</description>
