    <title>Unused content in the files</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unused-content-in-the-files/10948</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been busy searching through the mod files to see what&#39;s available when I came across these four skins for the female scientists: 

[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18318949/unusedscientist.png[/img]

Now, I&#39;ve already completed the mod and there only seems to be three female scientist skins used (Blonde middle aged, elderly grey-haired, brown haired young etc etc.) and I never came across one using any of those above skins - the fact that the hairstyle bodygroups available are designed only for the same used three skins seems to support the fact that these four skins weren&#39;t meant to appear ingame, you can&#39;t even get any of them via spawning through the console.

It makes me wonder if they actually do appear in the mod or not, or if there&#39;s any other unused stuff lying about.</description>

            <p>I would have had Eli in that room as well, then when you snag your suit he’d have had time to go meet up with Kleiner in the labs. Or a possible Breen cameo.</p>

            <p>Can I just guess? It’s not “Prepare for unforseen consequences” is it? Although I believe hes supposed to have said that to Eli.</p>
<p>Edit: I was ninja’ed! Well that is odd.</p>

<p>I found some interesting things out in the mod files. For instance you can find out what G-Man is lipsynced as saying in that office where you hear mumbling.</p>
