    <title>Black Mesa Localization uses (maybe) Source SDK Stock Subtitles</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-localization-uses-maybe-source-sdk-stock-subtitles/11574</link>
    <description>I prefered to actually make a separated thread for this.

The Italian localization (and probably a few others) seems to use some &quot;stock&quot; captions, even though there are equivalents in the captions file. Of course, modifying said equivalents doesn&#39;t actually change what it needs to change. And so i went and checked out the Source SDK GCFs, and i found some related captions, but even there any modification was to no avail, even if it was just copypasting values and editing them slightly just to see if it worked. And thus, to cut it short: Does anyone of you know where the game might be taking these &quot;stock&quot; captions from, and possibly how to change them? I&#39;m sure this would be really helpful to other translators and not just me.</description>

            <p>The translation is done, it <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=515870&amp;postcount=146" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">has been</a> in fact for a little while. The only, very minor thing that we didn’t work on is these stock captions which we can’t seem to be able to modify. If we can get a hold of those we are basically done, excluding additional future work</p>
