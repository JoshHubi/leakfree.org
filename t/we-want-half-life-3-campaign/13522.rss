    <title>We Want Half Life 3 campaign</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/we-want-half-life-3-campaign/13522</link>
    <description>Just discovered a campaign on idiegogo where a group of interns are gathering half life fans to fund some
really creative ways of getting the message across to valve and hopefully inspire them to make the game.

I think the idea is amazing, and some of the methods are just hilarious! Imagine an army of Gabe Newell
clones invading the campus while a billboard truck drives around valve headquarters the whole day! LOL!

            <p>Yeah, because Valve doesn’t know that we want Half-Life 3.</p>

            <p>You know what would be better? If they raised $150,000 and sent it to Valve with a caveat of “Only to be used in the development of HL3.”</p>
<p>If HL3 isn’t in development an ad campaign isn’t going to do anything to change that, and if it is in development anyways (making an ad campaign useless, surprise surprise) A HL3 that is $150,000 better doesn’t sound half bad.</p>

            <p>It’s probably a scam anyway. Besides, why would Valve NOT work on Half-Life 3 already? Jesus, I thought people would figure out that Valve knows there’s money in the HL franchise and therefore they wont abandon it. They’re just a smart company that bides their time and properly polish their games so their fanbase doesn’t go apeshit at a bad game.</p>

            <p>I don’t see how this would help any more than what the endless complaining online has done.</p>
