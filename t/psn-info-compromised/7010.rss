            <p>But PCs run on the World Wide Web (WWW) which:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">*Doesn’t directly require your bank account number or other personal information</span> (it is only acquired trough your internet operating company or web sites where you can buy stuff)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">*It is more efficient</span> (PSN was hacked during spring break and it wasn’t discovered until after spring break)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">*Is safer</span> (was origionally made by the military)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">*Can logically only get locally hacked</span> (It is so global and universal that nobody even can get close to hacking it, shutting it down and/or stealing vital information from all the users in just a few seconds or a few days)</p>

            <p>The PS3 was probably the console that took the longest to hack. It took, what, 4 years to get hacked?</p>
<p>Sony probably deserves props for making a system that took so long to hack.</p>
<p>Too bad everything else after that didn’t need as much time.</p>

</aside>
<p>I love how they put that as the last thing in the paragraph, although it is probably just as likely to have been compromised as anything else in a PSN account.</p>
<p>On a side-note, I have an xbox and… OMG PLAISTASHUN SUXX.</p>
<p>No, I’m not that guy. I feel for PS3 owners, because this situation really does suck. Hopefully they can get your online services back, and more securely. I will say that PSN has been pretty damn irresponsible, not that it is Playstation owner’s fault, but hopefully they have learned their lesson from this and that they can improve security. Actually, i think that this is going to be a wake-up call to all networks; hackers are getting more cunning, so hide yo’ passwords, hide yo’ credit card numbers, and hide yo’ mailing address, cuz they stealin’ all the info out there.</p>

            <p>Just got an email from them:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Playstation Network">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Playstation Network:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Valued PlayStation Network/Qriocity Customer:</p>
<p>We have discovered that between April 17 and April 19, 2011, certain PlayStation Network and Qriocity service user account information was compromised in connection with an illegal and unauthorized intrusion into our network. In response to this intrusion, we have:<br>
Temporarily turned off PlayStation Network and Qriocity services;<br>
Engaged an outside, recognized security firm to conduct a full and complete investigation into what happened; and<br>
Quickly taken steps to enhance security and strengthen our network infrastructure by re-building our system to provide you with greater protection of your personal information.<br>
We greatly appreciate your patience, understanding and goodwill as we do whatever it takes to resolve these issues as quickly and efficiently as practicable.</p>
<p>Although we are still investigating the details of this incident, we believe that an unauthorized person has obtained the following information that you provided: name, address (city, state/province, zip or postal code), country, email address, birthdate, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online ID. It is also possible that your profile data, including purchase history and billing address (city, state, zip), and your PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained. If you have authorized a sub-account for your dependent, the same data with respect to your dependent may have been obtained. While there is no evidence that credit card data was taken at this time, we cannot rule out the possibility. <span class="bbcode-b">[i]If you have provided your credit card data through PlayStation Network or Qriocity, to be on the safe side we are advising you that your credit card number (excluding security code) and expiration date may have been obtained.</span>[/i]</p>
<p>For your security, we encourage you to be especially aware of email, telephone, and postal mail scams that ask for personal or sensitive information. Sony will not contact you in any way, including by email, asking for your credit card number, social security, tax identification or similar number or other personally identifiable information. If you are asked for this information, you can be confident Sony is not the entity asking. When the PlayStation Network and Qriocity services are fully restored, we strongly recommend that you log on and change your password. Additionally, if you use your PlayStation Network or Qriocity user name or password for other unrelated services or accounts, we strongly recommend that you change them, as well.</p>
<p>To protect against possible identity theft or other financial loss, we encourage you to remain vigilant to review your account statements and to monitor your credit or similar types of reports.</p>
<p>We thank you for your patience as we complete our investigation of this incident, and we regret any inconvenience.  Our teams are working around the clock on this, and services will be restored as soon as possible. Sony takes information protection very seriously and will continue to work to ensure that additional measures are taken to protect personally identifiable information. Providing quality and secure entertainment services to our customers is our utmost priority. Please contact us at <a href="http://au.playstation.com/psnoutage" rel="nofollow noopener">au.playstation.com/psnoutage</a> should you have any additional questions.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Sony Network Entertainment and Sony Computer Entertainment Teams</p>
<p>Sony Network Entertainment Europe Limited (formerly known as PlayStation Network Europe Limited) is a subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Limited the data controller for PlayStation Network/Qriocity personal data</p>

<p>Th plaintiff lose because Sony did inform users of a potential threat the day of the outage.</p>
<p>If anyone has lost money because of the outage it’s their own damn fault because Sony stated from day one that the network had been potentially at risk.</p>
<p>And anyone saying Microsoft is better is a blind dumb ass because credit card info has been stolen from Microsoft several times.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually there’s been an interesting little article being passed around that features a chatlog over two hackers from months ago, insinuating that they had breached the network months prior to the PSN lockdown.</p>

            <p>Th plaintiff lose because Sony did inform users of a potential threat the day of the outage.</p>
<p>If anyone has lost money because of the outage it’s their own damn fault because Sony stated from day one that the network had been potentially at risk.</p>
<p>And anyone saying Microsoft is better is a blind dumb ass because credit card info has been stolen from Microsoft several times.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, Sony should have encrypted everything. I’d be interested to know why they didn’t to be honest.</p>
<p>As long as people realise its not just Sonys fault, people are acting like Sony sat there handing this information out. I’m quite impressed how as soon as they found out there was a breach they shut the system down and started investigating.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’m not happy I’ve had to change a lot of passwords but I don’t begrudge Sony at all.</p>

            <p>Of course the hacking is the hackers fault, but i don’t think sony can just get a free pass here from maintaining such a bad security on their system</p>
