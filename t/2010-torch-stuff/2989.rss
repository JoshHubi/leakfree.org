<p>You’re just going in circles now. Try actually basing your claims on fact, or demonstrating reason and logic. And your question wasn’t really a question, more of another example of your stupidity. Check your own posts, your growing anger and frustration is clear for all to see. Try again. Your failure is almost complete…</p>
<p>PS: I love it how I can keep you replying and trying again and again. Especially after you tried to bail on your own trolling attempt.</p>

            <p>Lol it neither takes much of my time, nor do I find it a waste - you still fall back on saying something as if it were true. Making up things hasn’t worked out well for you so far. I also find it funny that you think you’re appearing smart. For example, you try to mock me for “wasting my time replying to someone I don’t know”, yet fail to see the irony - you’re doing exactly the same thing numpty. Please give us more examples of your stupidity and failure to troll.</p>

            <p>Now that you’re stupidity has been pointed out, you’d LIKE it to be all done wouldn’t you. However, you seem to have forgotten that YOU were the one that decided to begin trolling and bring the focus to yourself. I already said I had no problem with replying to your trolling, so don’t get shy and try to back out now.</p>
<p>You are the one that seems confused. Your trolling has so far only succeeded in making you look like a fool, getting only YOURSELF all worked up and raging (I ROFL’d at that by the way so thanks) and you somehow managed to let yourself be fooled into openly admitting you’re just here to troll - something that may or may not go down well with the mods that have already banned you before.</p>
<p>Looks like fail troll is fail. You’re the sort of person that would hold a gun to your own head and yell “gimme all your money” into the mirror. Nice work, Einstein. Lol.</p>

<p>Ah, the old “it’s just the internet, so it’s ok for me to be dumb”. So you think it’s ok to sound like a moron unless you’re writing an essay? Gee, what high standards you set for yourself. Here’s a tip - using things like correct spelling/grammar, reason, logic, supporting your claims etc are not just for when you’re writing an essay.</p>

<p>I agree with him.  Your posts are just self-contained standards.  You think using the word “trollbait” would get you somewhere in a debate?  I’m involved in contemporary analytic philosophy and formal logic so I’m used to nitpicking langauge.  I don’t see a problem with dissecting what people say.  I don’t think having a standard for accuracy make you a troll.</p>
<p>Evidently you’re a dick now-a-days if you have an education.  If you don’t want Shasta to tell HeadCrabeD how to think and act then why don’t you start being consistent and not tell him how to think and act?</p>

<p>hahaha, All I was saying is that your TL;DRs and caps indicate that you are a brilliant example of raging trollbait. That post proved it yet again. Thank you for great fun.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t matter a slightest whether I agree with you or not.<br>
P.S. How does one take another seriously on the internetz?</p>

</aside>
<p>As expected, you’re back with more nonsense. My posts are calm examples of reason and demonstrated logic, on topic as much as possible. Your posts seem to be nothing but off topic trolling / personal attack attempts with a little rage and a little name calling. Try harder kid.</p>

<p>I didn’t say you raged. I pointed out that you agreed with my message, not the way I made it. What makes you think my posts are in a “rage” anyway? I’ve just been calmly pointing out peoples stupidity and offering suggestions to help them avoid similar mistakes in the future. Judging from your comments (including “you spelled mean wrong” lol) you don’t seem to have a grasp on this conversation anyway. Plus your comments seem rather raging for someone who claims to not be raging. I just can’t take you seriously. Thanks for playing, better luck next time.</p>
