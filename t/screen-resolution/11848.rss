    <description>The game changes my res while running and changes back when I quit, I&#39;m fine with this.
But very occasionally when I quit, it doesn&#39;t get changed back.

No big deal, just go and set resolution again, but I thought you might want to know.</description>

            <p>Might be a good idea to set the game to your native resolution, it will look more crisp and maybe less distorted (depends on the aspect ratio) plus it won’t change res when you start/quit the game. If the game is already set to your desktop resolution maybe adding  -novid  in the game launch options will work.</p>

            <p>I haven’t messed with launch options at all, since I didn’t have trouble running the game as is, so… probably no.</p>

            <p>Do you have the “-dxlevel xx” command enabled in the launch options?</p>
