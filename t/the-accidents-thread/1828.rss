    <description>Yes, post some of your accidents from the past.

I got hit by a car today while biking, My leg muscle is fucked but apparently no bones are broken. Thing is, the driver looked suspiciously like Hubi, Coincidence?
I also demand that my user title be changed to &quot;got hit by a car&quot; for emotional support.

And I&#39;ve fallen over a fence and broken my arm before.

Yep. Fun. :retard:</description>

            <p>I managed to break my wrist running down a hill in sixth grade. Turned out my mom (the only person within an hour and a half drive) was in a meeting until 2, so I spent two hours sitting in the office clutching a broken wrist. Add in all the waiting at the doctor’s office and I got the first splint (not including the clipboard taped to my arm by a sympathetic nurse) a full four hours after it broke.</p>

            <p>Other than the typical scar-inducing fall, I’ve broken my elbow, lit my hair on fire, electrocuted myself 4 times and accidentally slammed my ankle into a steel fence. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Oh, and when I was coming back from a field trip back in elementary school I accidentally got my thumb stuck in the door jamb of a Volvo, which ended up getting locked by the driver while it happened. Needless to say, I lost a fingernail and have a scar underneath the newer one.</p>

            <p>This happened a long time ago, back when I was stupid…well, stupider.</p>
<p>I was working the deli department at the local grocery store.   At the end of the day, I was tasked to clean the deli slicer.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you see where I’m going with this.   Anyway, they had these chainmail gloves that were to protect the fingers, but I didn’t like to use them because the water and the meat and cheese remnants got into the links of the chainmail and made it feel like a muddied clumps.  So, I had the bright idea to clean the slicer without wearing the gloves.</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>I still have a scar on the pointer and middle finger on my right hand.</p>

            <p>When I was 4, I was climbing on the kitchen counter trying to get a bag of chips and I fell off. I tried to catch myself on something, only to grab onto the steak knife holder, I proceeded to fall with the knifes and one of them cut my belly open. Somehow it didn’t scar.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, there was also the time I stuck my finger in a power outlet. But that wasn’t so much an accident, as it was me being an idiot.</p>

            <p>So I was camping and my friend tossed me one of those glass stink bombs that you throw on the ground, the fire we had last night was still smoldering so I tossed it in. About 2 minute later nothing had happened so I went to poke it with a stick… As I poked the glass it exploded sending shrapnel into both my eyebrows (pretty fucking close to losing my eyes) I had a 1 inch cut across my brow, it’s almost fully healed now. Not one of my smarter ideas, although my friend was laughing his ass off calling me a dumbass. (he’s probably right):3</p>
<p>And another day when I was surfing my board flipped and the fin almost went straight up my asshole. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

            <p>Not much bad stuff happens to me, but that doesn’t apply to my friends:</p>
<p>One of my friends shot another in the back with a .22 on accident. It would only be serious if it was a real gun, but still . . .</p>
<p>Another, smaller stature friend was hit by a segway and broke his arm. Yeah, I know. A segway.</p>
<p>Two guys I know were making explosives (!), and one went off and blew off a lot of one guy’s hand.</p>
<p>One time I was golfing, and got hit by a 150 foot drive in the back. I rolled down a hill cussing, trying to smother the pain.</p>
<p>Most recently, I was lit on fire during a lab experiment, but it was only along half of my leg, and I smothered it by rolling.</p>

            <p>I was smashed by a car when I was J-walking a few months ago.</p>
<p>I once grabbed a glass doorknob and it popped in my hand.</p>
<p>During a football drill 2 years ago my right arm was shredded open right before the forearm by some kid’s broken helmet, the scar looks like a small candy.</p>

            <p>I fall off the bike all the time, I think I’ve totally ruined 4 bikes by crashing them into posts, trees, sidewalks and parked cars.</p>
<p>I’ve also broke my arm once while running after a bus on an icy road.</p>
<p>One time I was biking pretty fast at night and there’s a passage that blocks cars from going there (4 short concrete posts) well I thought I passed but I hit it pretty hard and felt pretty stupid, but I didn’t feel much pain. After I got home I realized that my ipod was what protected me. Obviously it got smashed to a million pieces though.</p>

            <p>About 2 years ago, my best friend (who passed away a month ago  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> ) was handling my 30" full tang katana, and when he went to hand it back to me, handle up, he lost his grip and the blade headed towards my feet.  Being a 30" blade, and considering he was holding the sword at waist-height when he dropped it, there were only about 3" between the blade and my foot, leaving very little reaction time.</p>
<p>So I simultaneously yanked my foot back while reaching for it with my right hand…and ended up catching the blade with my right hand as gravity did its work and drew the blade down the inside of my right index finger.  Damn near took the finger off, the blade went down to the bone.</p>
<p>Mind you, my friend and I were at my house alone, were both 18 at the time so at least we had some (marginal) sense.  Hydrogen peroxided the hell out of it, wrapped it in gauze and went about our day :-).</p>

            <p>Damn.</p>
<p>My dad sliced his elbow off (sounds strange) riding a minibike when he was a kid. Not me but still.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago I hacked into my left knee with the thing on the picture below while cutting down little trees in my internship. I limped to my car, tied the wound off with some bandages and drove to the hospital where it got sewn up.</p>

            <p>shit in face. Actually that reminds me of a horrid incident involving my cat and my mother. My mom was trying to read, and the cat jumped onto her lap, and started doing that cat thing of walking around in circles on her lap. At one point his butt was in her face and she tried to push him off. Then he launched a projectile shit directly into her eyeball. My mom screamed and it freaked all of us the hell out. By then the cat was well out of the vicinity. will NEVER forget that for my entre life…</p>
