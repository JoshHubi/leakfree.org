            <p>Though I’m still not sure about that considering that there are parts pertaining to the helmet under the “npc_human_medic” section (helmet_medic). I don’t see anything else like that for grunts.</p>

            <p>The only thing I see that seems possibly related to it in the “npc_human_grunt” codes is “head” under “bodygroup_data”</p>

<p>There is a mod on the workshop which uses modified/unused character_manifest stuff to add that sort of things.</p>

<p>I have that mod, but the chances of a grunt spawning like that is actually pretty low. I’d say probably 1 out of every 10 spawns with just a helmet. I went through the file and I’m not sure which code changes that.</p>
