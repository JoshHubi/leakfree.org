    <title>When tech support needs tech support...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/when-tech-support-needs-tech-support/1848</link>
    <description>...They go to their favorite forum for tech help.

I am the most techy of the family, so when there is a problem they come to me.  This particular problem is that I cant figure out and I need help.  How do I get the &quot;Steve&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth&quot; folders in the picture below to NOT give me the security error.  I already verified that they are NOT user accounts, and I am already logged in as the &quot;Administrator&quot;. 

So, how do I get rid of that error/gain access to those folders?

Also, what and where is the setting that auto hides your desktop shortcuts?

Thanks for the help guys. I am really stuck.

            <p>If you want to do it remotely you can pick Safe Mode with Networking and then use a bundled VNC server and client like RealVNC, TightVNC, or UltraVNC so you can do it for her. It should work pretty easily as long as she doesn’t have a router/firewall. It should allow it through her Windows XP firewall with PNP support but if it doesn’t it will still ask her if she wants to block or unblock the traffic from the VNC app so it should be able to get through that. I could get it done it 5 min, 10 min max if there are any hitches…</p>

            <p>What you need to do is claim ownership of the directories. You could chown them in Linux/BSD and retrieve what you need that way. If you don’t know or want to do that you can boot into safe mode by pressing F8 when Windows is booting. Right click on the folder you are wanting to change permissions for and there are a few things you can do. Now I don’t use Windows anymore and haven’t for 4-5 years, but I am pretty certain you have to claim ownership of the directories you want to change permissions to or it won’t let you change any permissions. This can only be done in Sage Mode and you should also click:</p>
<p>Apply Changes to all Sub Directories</p>
<p>or whatever it says similar to that<br>
After you take ownership you should be able to browse without getting Access Denied and will be able to change permissions, I can’t give you exact word for word directions cause like I said I haven’t used Windows myself, except for cleaning up other ppls shit, in about 4-5 years. I still use Windows every now and then maybe ever 3-6 months for my Steam Games, but thats it.</p>

<p>And this is a windows xp system.</p>

            <p>Remote desktop doesn’t work when you go into safe mode nor does it work in linux. Keep that in mind.</p>

            <p>Go into safe-mode (it depends what motherboard you’re using, but typically this can be accessed by pressing F5 or similar on your mobo’s splashscreen). Then navigate to these folders, right click them and set the permissions that way. If you’d like a more detailed step-by-step procedure, I can provide that in about 30 minutes when I get home.

            <p>That’s easy, assuming the folders are locked due to account restriction (and not bad sectors on your hard drive) Just boot up your favourite flavour of live linux and copy the contents of those folders somewhere else.</p>
