    <title>Is it possible to add a tab to the options dialog?</title>

    <description>[b]Aye, I think I found something:[/b]

[url=&#39;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Making_GameUI_Panels&#39;]VGUI2: Creating a panel - developer.valvesoftware.com[/url]

As of now, my C++ knowledge is close to zero, since I have been experimenting with C# in the past years, only....

If there is any way to just add a page / tab to the existing panel, I&#39;d be more than happy to know about it.  :slight_smile: 

If there is no other way than using C++, I think I have to drop this idea (again).  :frowning: 

Thanks in advance!

[b]EDIT (09:13 PM):[/b] I&#39;ve also tried to somehow &quot;squeeze&quot; the controls I wanted to add into the existing &quot;Black Mesa&quot; tab, but there&#39;s just not enough space left for 4 Labels and 3 Sliders...

[b][i]Original thread text:[/i][/b]

[COLOR=&#39;#808080&#39;]Good afternoon,

while browsing through some of the mod files I came to think about adding a new options tab to the in-game (options) menu itself (similiar to how the DEV-Team added their &quot;Black Mesa&quot; tab).

I did figure out how to add and change certain sliders and labels to said &quot;Black Mesa&quot; tab and to make them actually do something, but I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to &quot;duplicate&quot; said Black Mesa options tab - so I can edit this duplicated tab.

There is an [url=&#39;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Adding_convars_to_the_multiplayer_advanced_tab&#39;]article in VALVe&#39;s developer wiki[/url] I found.

It describes how to add controls for different ConVars.

What I am trying to do, is add a new tab for different controls (checkboxes, sliders, etc.) entirely (as illustrated in the image below).

[b]Note:[/b] The above image shows, what I&#39;m trying to accomplish (not entirely, but it would be a start).

Is there a way to do this?

Any help would be much appreciated!

[b]Note 2:[/b] This may be the wrong subforum (I think it is), so if it is, please move this thread. I&#39;d like to say sorry in advance, if that is the case.  :wink: [/SIZE]</description>
