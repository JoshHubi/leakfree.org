    <title>A map of BM&#39;s Black Mesa Research Facility</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-map-of-bms-black-mesa-research-facility/12439</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve spent the better part of today capturing overhead views of each and every one of the game&#39;s map, and I&#39;ve consolidated them into one image. It&#39;s pretty interesting how vast this place really is.

Some mods present in the image:
On a Rail: Loop Mod by .RK
On a Rail Uncut by TextFAMGUY1
Surface Tension Uncut by TextFAMGUY1

            <p>Thanks Again RK so I believe that puts the outside area in WGH firmly at the north of the facility.</p>
<p>By your word North Gate it shall be. Perhaps N1</p>
<p>I think I will stay clear of the road signage as It could cause more continuity errors and leave it ambiguous. I thought about Route to all gates sign and thought about a ring road. But I will be steering clear on that based on what you have said.</p>

            <p>All the maps are oriented uniformly in the game, so the way you see them here is the way they are oriented in-game (bar on a rail uncut and apprehension) It really helps with consistency, even from a behind the scenes standpoint.</p>
<p>Talking direction-wise, the map itself is 90-degrees clockwise from the actual, so <span class="bbcode-b">north</span> is towards the <span class="bbcode-b">left side</span> of the map. To put it in perspective, when you come out of the dam and follow the river to the pipes, you are traveling <span class="bbcode-i">south.</span> I’m basing this on the sun’s angles on the few outdoor sections we see.</p>
<p>I can’t answer those last three questions though because there’s no good information on that. The dam <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> have a name, but I don’t know what it is. More chiefly though there’s no way to tell how far we are from neither the dam nor the lambda complex since the two sections are completely arbitary from WGH and <span class="bbcode-i">especially</span> since the entirety of the Surface Tension through Lambda Core sections is one big impossible clusterfuck in the game.</p>

            <p>I consider you the spacial expert on Black Mesa RK just so you know that.</p>
<p>I have a couple of more questions regarding WGH outside area.</p>
<p>Where are we on the compass in this outside area North / south /east or west (plan view of facility)?</p>
<p>One more question how far are we from the dam in Kilometers and does the Dam have a name? Also how far are we from Lambda complex?</p>
<p>I am planning on making a road sign if you are wondering why I am asking this so It has not got to be totally accurate but a rough estimate will do.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>It’s not an issue the dormitarys would be on the platform where there is no soda machine.</p>
<p>Nothing needs fixing.</p>
<p>The side with the soda machine would give workers access to the storage facility</p>

            <p>With the gap between Unforeseen Consequences and Office Complex being completely arbitrary (because you do so via elevator), so the best we can do is guess.</p>
<p>That being said, if we assume a flat ground between Inbound and WGH, and the fact that WGH’s C map is five floors higher than the A map (which I would guess at 18 ft height per floor including ceiling structure would be around 90 feet), then we would have WGH’s A map being 90 feet below Inbound.</p>

            <p>I have a question rk not sure if you can answer it even approximateley but…</p>
<p>How high is the dormitary from inbound in relation to the first map of we’ve got hostiles?</p>
<p>I noticed the 2 maps are alnost on top of one another.</p>
<p>But I have no idea if the surface slopes from the surface in we got hostiles up or down in relation to inbound.</p>

<p>Thanks for clearing that up. Also, what maps are those parts covered in in <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 1</span>?</p>

Both maps are taking on a level overview scale of 4. By comparison, the original round of maps I took was done at the scale of 10.</p>
<p>I’ll be doing another full round of maps once the next BM update hits, I think. And definitely when Xen hits.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, I’ll be capturing Surface Tension Uncut tomorrow.</p>
<p>EDIT: Have some STU<br>

<p>If I’m not mistaken, in the original Half-Life after you traverse through the dam, you enter the the pipe to the D map on the right-hand side of the river valley. In Black Mesa, it’s the opposite…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, you’re completely right. In BM the pipes are on the left side of the valley while in HL version’s is on the right side. But now consider the attached picture.</p>
<p>As you can see, even though HL’s version was on the right wall, the canyon itself makes a <span class="bbcode-i">left</span> turn. This puts the pipes heading east, away from the dam face.</p>
<p>This was then belayed by the fact that in HL, the pipes then made a left turn, so the player is still heading north like in BM’s B map. However, <span class="bbcode-i">unlike</span> BM, this isn’t so much of a problem because HL’s dam is actually facing away from the QE labs, and because of that the B map does not head back in that direction either.</p>

<p>There might be a way. If they could do it with Half-Life, then they could probably do it with Black Mesa. How to go about doing that though, I have absolutely no freaking clue. I too would like to see a 3D map, I just don’t know how.</p>

<p>Pretty much. And to top it off, the Xen chapters featured lots of teleporting, so if they do that with BM then the Xen maps would be segmented from each other.</p>
<p>I might make a version that includes the Xen maps if, you know, they map well.<br>

            <p>.RK, this map is really cool. It’s awesome to see the whole game laid out like that, and I could never put in that much effort like that. However, I would love to see (I’m not asking anyone to do this, but I think it would be cool) a 3D version of this map. You spend most of the game underground, and it would be cool to see exactly how far underground you are. However, it would also be interesting to see if there are any inconsistensies with how far beneath the surface you are. Is there any way to take extremely low-polygon versions of the maps and extremely low-res versions of their textures, and export them to a 3D modeling suite?</p>

<p>This is a map of the Black Mesa Research Facility. Xen, being a completely different place, wouldn’t be in this map. It could be mapped, and that would be cool, but integrating it into this map would leave it completely seperate because you teleport into it rather than walking through a door.</p>

            <p>Awesome map .RK! Love it!</p>
<p>I know someone did a 3D render of all of the BMRF for the original Half-Life once… Probably impossible with Black Mesa, though. Too much detail… And the overlaps would me all the more painful.</p>

            <p>Double posting, but only because Oh my God. If a mod wants to merge, please do so.<br>
I have just realized that when I was doing Unforeseen Consequences, I pasted a section twice (if you look just south of where the Anti Mass Spectrometer is located, a location appears twice). And because of that everything from late UC to Apprehension is shifted southeast by quite a fair bit.</p>
<p>I’m working on a new version of the map anyways though so this will be fixed.</p>

<p>Ooo, that’s a really good one. I never really got to see Nova Prospect up close. Or Anticitizen One. Or Follow Freeman. The full HL2 map is really good, but I haven’t been able to find one yet that let me see them up close (because they’d always error on me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  )</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, this map got featured on the BM facebook page. Cool!</p>
