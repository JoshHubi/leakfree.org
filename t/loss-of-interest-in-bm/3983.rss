    <title>Loss of Interest in BM?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/loss-of-interest-in-bm/3983</link>
    <description>It is now July and I have noticed that there are a lot less threads or discussions on the website lately. I&#39;ve noticed that no one I know really talks about Black Mesa anymore. It seems that a lot of people are losing interest in BM because of the delay, no release date, less news and threads, and no updates to speak of. I think that if the devs gave us at least a written update saying the mod would be out in 2010, then more people would support it. Which, I can&#39;t see the mod coming out any later than 2010 because the engine would be too dated compared to other games like Portal 2 and HL2: Episode 3. It&#39;s kind of weird going on a website that was once visited and supported by lots of people, that now seems deserted. I know the devs say they don&#39;t care about this, but the mod is losing less and less potential everyday.

I&#39;m just sharing my concern about people losing interest in the mod. I just want to state my opinion and create a thread. I don&#39;t want this to be a hate thread, just a place of discussion.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I used to help run <a href="http://AllMetallica.com" rel="nofollow noopener">AllMetallica.com</a>. During that time I interviewed Dave Mustaine for our forums (it was while St. Anger was being made, I think). Not sure if that interview is still available… as the site has gone way down and even changed ownership since then. But anyways, my point is that I liked both bands then, and still do now… and from what I can tell, they’ve worked out their feelings between them, also (the bands).</p>
<p>Also, side note, it’s funny how a thread labeled “Loss of Interest” is actually deteriorating into talk such as this.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Justin Beiber isn’t dead yet. I mean, who have 300 000 000+ views on youtube ? This little fag.</p>
<p>That’s why I hate conflict that shouldn’t exist between two freakin’ awesome bands. Seriously, both makes good music and, as James would say, nothing else matters.</p>
<p>This as to be one of the biggest off topic ever, seriously. I suggest we stop this now.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>what kind of music does Justin Beiber actually play? I’ve never even heard one of his songs before all I hear is how everyone hates him so much.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I believe there is a loss of interest in BM because [u][i]<span class="bbcode-b">this thread is </span>[b]horribly off topic!</p>
<p>[/b][/i][/u]But no, in all seriousness I don’t think there is a loss of <span class="bbcode-u">interest</span> as much as a loss of <span class="bbcode-u">patience</span> from the few that don’t understand the development process. If the Team is in the polishing phase (which I am assuming they are for most chapters), they are in the most stressful/time-consuming phase of development, as the Devs will attempt to find every bug (or misplaced enemy, prop, texture, etc.) they can and repair it. Which also explains the update silence. Why would they waste time saying “Yep, just moved that lamp that got in the way” or “Removed a sound that didn’t make sense” every 15 minutes? They’re working to make this game near-perfect using their own time as efficiently as possible, and keeping us up to date on every little thing would be impractical.</p>

<p>I’m someone who buys music, I buy music after hearing parts of the album first (either through online previews/mediaplayers or on the demo-units at music stores). However, due to ridiculous comments of fans like yourself that Death Magnetic was an old school Metallica album, I bought it without giving it a spin beforehand. Sadly, this is the only album to date that I regret ever buying.</p>
<p>No it’s not old school. Lars’ drums still sound like shit, just slightly less shit than on St. Anger, Kirk just abuses the wah-wah pedal at 400 miles an hour while going up and down the same scale over and over again, and James has never sounded as bad as he does on this album. And don’t get me started on the actual lyrics (“Love is a four letter word”… Really, James?). Add to that a bassist who’s style just doesn’t fit Metallica at all, and you have an album that just sounds bad. The only thing that can be considered old school, is that they caved in and let Kirk pull off some solos again, bad idea.</p>
<p>I’ve seen Metallica live twice (2004 and 2009) and Megadeth once (few months ago), and it was amazing (granted, Dave kind of needed to get into it, but after 15-20 minutes he was on a roll).</p>
<p>I grew up with Metallica’s pre-Load work, and it saddens me to see the state they’re in right now. On the other hand, I’ve only started listening to Megadeth a few years ago (due to growing up with Metallica and the bullshit that you can’t like Megadeth if you like Metallica, and visa versa). I’d trade in tickets to a Metallica show for a Megadeth show any day.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then there’s nothing I can do for you. On the other hand, you, respect other people’s tastes. You prefer Megadeath over Metallica ? I’m freakin’ fine with this. But seriously, don’t say that they sucked in the past 19 years. There’s other people who like their recent stuff (like me) and that’s their choice. I, myself, don’t like megadeath. But at least, I’m not yelling how bad I think they are.</p>
<p>So yeah. As I said before, we should really stop this off topic dude. I mean the flame war could go on and on…</p>

            <p>Justin Beiber isn’t dead yet. I mean, who have 300 000 000+ views on youtube ? This little fag.</p>
<p>That’s why I hate conflict that shouldn’t exist between two freakin’ awesome bands. Seriously, both makes good music and, as James would say, nothing else matters.</p>
<p>This as to be one of the biggest off topic ever, seriously. I suggest we stop this now.</p>

            <p>Megadeth had some bad times… The risk album was horrid when viewed from thrash metal point of view.</p>
<p>Justin Beiber is now dead… nobody likes him (I though he was a girl when I first saw him). Now the new target is rappers.</p>

<p>The difference between Metallica and Megadeth is that Metallica stopped making decent albums 19 years ago.</p>
<p>Also: Megadeth still sounds nice live. James just can’t handle vocals anymore, Lars looks and sounds like a demented Animal (from the Muppets, that is), Robbert was born a few hundred of thousands of years too late, and Kirk still can’t solo for shit live.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The first part is not true at all, as it is a matter of tastes. If you liked their old stuff like “Kill em’ all” or “Ride the lightning”, there’s a new album called “Death Magnetic”. Oh, haven’t you heard ? I guess not. As a die hardcore fan, this is my favourite album. And you know what ? I like, I mean… I love “Load” and “Reload” AND “St.Anger”. With some awesome songs like King Nothing, Until it sleeps, Fuel, The Memory Remains, The unamed feeling, etc. All of their albums are worth it, you just don’t know them well.</p>
<p>And I saw them live at Ottawa the 23th november and dude, I almost died because of how awesome they were. God, you are trying to make me rage and it works. Grrr.</p>
<p>Seriously, we should stop this now. There shouldn’t be any fight between any metal band. Together, we should stay united and attack our number one target : Justin Beiber.</p>
