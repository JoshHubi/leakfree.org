</aside>
<p>I can’t, because this is insanely complex, but <a href="http://reddit.com/r/asksience" rel="nofollow noopener">reddit.com/r/asksience</a> might have some better info, I saw a lot of posts there earlier.</p>

<p>To put it into perspective, this is basically being able to look directly at conditions about <span class="bbcode-i">10^-34 seconds</span> after the origin of the universe.</p>

<p>That is impressive a number.  A drop of water (about 0.5mL) has 10^22 atoms in it and 10^25 is considerably larger than that (but less than a liter of water).</p>
<p>Still, pretty damned impressive.</p>

<p>Wow. That’s like 10^25 eV.</p>
<p>(Not so impressive sounding, now, is it?)</p>
