    <title>Black Mesa is droping my wireless connection</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-is-droping-my-wireless-connection/10712</link>
    <description>So i was playing Black Mesa and sister is yelling from another room that i should fix wireless connection. When i found out it&#39;s the router that is dropping wireless i wanted to fix it. I started to change settings in router firmware and everytime i changed something wireless was fixed and stable again. And everytime I would alt+tab back to game sister would start yelling again. OMG let me play.  :smiley: 

Ok what the hell.. I started cmd on my laptop and started to ping -t. Back to game with alt+tab -&gt; request timeout and general failure on cmd. I tested this many times now alt+tabbing in and out and wireless dies when i alt+tab back to the game. I can&#39;t play the game without wireless crashing.  :smiley: 

//EDIT

Things i tried and didn&#39;t solve the problem:

-steam offline mode. Wireless drop as soon as i start the game.
-disabling lan controller on the PC where i run Black Mesa
-adding firewall exception to block hl.exe</description>

            <p>Ok i fixed the problem. Router was directly behind the monitor so it was interference from monitor cable or monitor itself. I moved the router to another place and the problem is gone.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>My only plausible explanation left is a fault in the electrical wiring in your walls or in your PC which could explain black mesa=your PC suddenly using more power, emitting more noise on the ground wire and the router malfunctioning. My next suggestion is obviously to move the router to another room(further from the computer playing black mesa).</p>

            <p>I have no wifi connection or device in my PC and my network adapter is Realtek pcie gbe family controller. I agree it is very weird but every time it happens like in the video, even when i unplug the utp cable that connects PC-&gt; router.</p>

            <p>Does your computer have built-in Wifi? If you only experience this issue with BM I would say it’s weird but I don’t believe in paradoxes and I would suggest you relocate the router into another room.</p>

<p>I already told you. Steam is resetting your network adapter. You don’t have to be connected to a network for that to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It can reset my network adapter on my PC but it cannot interfere with router settings and wireless because it is PHYSICALLY DISCONNECTED from the network and no wireless connection is available on my PC. I plugged out the network cable from the router. Or what am I missing here ?</p>

            <p>I wont be changing IP settings to manual, too much hassle. And it’s only BM doing this. I rather play at night when nobody is using wireless.</p>

            <p>Change IP setting for all the computers in the house to manual, problem solved. Unless your PC is a microwave oven there is no way it can affect the 2.4ghz band like you are describing.</p>

            <p>I have windows firewall. I turned it off and it didn’t solve the issue.</p>
<p>I still can’t get over the fact that disconnecting the PC from network didn’t solve the problem. It doesn’t make sense.</p>

            <p>Steam likes to do all sorts of things to throw connections off. What could be happening is that you have some sort of firewall/whatever that doesn’t recognise Steam/BMS and is resetting your network connection every time that it detects the process. You could have a stupid firewall that locks down your entire connection and your hardware when it detects an executable that it doesn’t like. BMS is only v1.0 it could be very possible that some crazy AV or Firewall would see that it is coded badly and attempt to lock down your network.</p>
<p>Just disable all the protection you have for a moment and see if it’s still a problem. I had the same sort of problem with a few older games like Wolf 3D a long time ago.</p>

            <p>It’s totally illogical now for my PC (or BM) to cause internet problems since it’s disconnected from the network PHYSICALLY. But it happens like in the video.</p>
