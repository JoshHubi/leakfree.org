        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I never suggested that Valve would randomly hand out their IP to any old outfit, so how about a little less arrogance Crypt?<br>
It’s not beyond the realms of possibilities for Valve and CC, or any other game studio for that matter, to work together on HL3, with Valve being the publisher. For instance, Turtle Rock studios developed Left For Dead and the game was published by Valve, which is just one example of Valve working with other devs.<br>
It’s that kind of scenario that I’m suggesting with impeccable logic as it happens.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Valve has no desire to create a Half Life 3. It is literally dead in the water after a cliffhanger ending. It kinda sucks but they make too much money off of steam and micro transactions in their freemium games to notice their fans and when you combine this with their total lack of structure, there is no driving force to get it done. Even after operation crowbar, Gabe just stopped talking about it all together</p>

<p>Valve would never sell <span class="bbcode-s">or give</span> the HL3 IP to anyone, especially Crowbar Collective (nothing against CC).<br>
As for them waiting to see the market response to a remake of a 20 year old game that is 12+ years in the making*, well that’s just plain laughable.[/size]</p>

            <p>Both of you are correct and wrong.</p>
<p>Yes, they wouldn’t just give it away.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Since Valve doesn’t appear to be interested in developing anything HL related any more, or in fact any single player games, I’d put money on The Crowbar Collective being handed the HL3 portfolio.<br>
With the success of Black Mesa, it seems entirely logical to me.</p>
