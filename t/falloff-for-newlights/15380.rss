    <title>Falloff For NewLights</title>

    <description>Not sure if this is a feature that&#39;s supposed to be in the game (making its absence a bug) or just something that was never implemented (making this a feature request) but the falloff parameters on the newLight_spot and newLight_point entities do not work- their falloff is always quadratic.</description>

<p>Yes old fall-off parameters are no longer supported. They have been taken out of shaders to reduce complexity.<br>
Lights dont have any explicit falloff parameter in current version and they always follow quadratic fall off curve only, its more physically based and gives better results in our experience.</p>
