    <title>Dedicated server map problems</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dedicated-server-map-problems/14853</link>
    <description>Hey,

Since, a couple of days I&#39;ve been having an issue with the dedicated server.

Several maps seem to differ between the dedicated server and the main game.

When i load the maps through the menu play online and start the maps, they load perfectly.

But when I try to play the maps through the dedicated server he gives me the message, that they differ from the server.

I&#39;ve been running a vanilla game and a vanilla server. So it shouldn&#39;t be a workshop / mod related problem.

I also tried to verify the gamecaches of both the game and the server, but the issue persists.

here is a picture of the message,

Is this a known problem and/or is there a way to resolve this issue?

Kind regards,

            <p>Not having the dedicated server installed, I can’t confirm this, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/346680/depots/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamdb.info/app/346680/depots/</a>, the current build of the Black Mesa Dedicated Server was released on May 14, 2016 – 22:19:04 UTC. That was the same day the Black Mesa v0.3.0 Content Update was released. However, the v0.3.1 patch to Black Mesa was released on June 5, 2016 – 05:53:03 UTC, and it doesn’t look like they updated the Dedicated Server along with the regular game. So that might explain why the local and server maps differ.</p>
