    <description>I just saw this youtube video:
[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqFU5C9ppaw[/url]

And I really like the workflow of that Particle Editor, it seems better then valves&#39; editor. I started doing some basic particles but the UI really for the preview really could be alot more user friendly. 

I wonder if it is available to the public and if not if it could be released.</description>

            <p>Good thank your for the response, since I’m working on a mod (just to learn though), it wouldn’t be a problem to add those changes, but I’m starting to get used to valves’ editor. So it’s no problem. Thanks again.</p>

            <p>IIRC, our editor requires in-engine flags to watch for file changes and reload appropriately, meaning it doesn’t work stand-alone and won’t work for vanilla EP2 without special dlls (like Black Mesa’s).</p>
<p>IMO, it’s worth getting over the learning curve in Valve’s editor as there you have realtime feedback (no alt-tabbing) and you have more visibility between the interactions of particle systems.  We have all moved on to using Valve’s editors for these reasons.</p>
<p>Also our editor was built blind (essentially), and doesn’t have ALL of the options that valve’s does (as we built it before valve’s editor existed, so we guessed at the available parameters.</p>
<p>It would take quite a bit of work I imagine to get our editor release-worthy and with a seperate dll/mod setup to be able to use with Vanilla EP2.  I’d rather not spend the time on that work now when we have plenty of other stuff be to focusing on.</p>

<p>Yeah, I remember mine too, lol.</p>
<p>I posted a suggestion in the suggestion board about vending machines that gives shirts, books, beer, newspapers and cigarettes etc. like in Japan. (you can find anything in vending machines in japan)</p>
<p>Everyone said it’s useless and that it’s a stupid idea. But it would look cool though. like you would see someone buy a hat out of a vending machine and put it on or something.</p>

            <p>I’ll say it nicely, by BM standards: you need balls and a backbone to survive here. Just because you get the shit flamed out of you for your first post doesn’t mean that you should leave. Most of us (even the proud few who ACTUALLY READ THE FREAKING FAQ) have been flamed at some point. By BM standards, you got away with a mere singe.</p>

<p>Also it’s not that the forums are useless, it’s just some of the people in the forums are. ;^D</p>

            <p>I didn’t mean to harm anyone, its just a simple Question.<br>
I searched for a while in the forum, searched for an irc channel, found the steam group and got pointed back to the forum.</p>
<p>And since that thread you pointed me to seems to have been mostly flamed to hell, whats wrong about making a thread and asking. It’s not like some wasted kilobytes in a database do matter.</p>
<p>And thank you for proving to me how useless forums are, next time I have a question, I’ll just idle in the chat room longer until I find someone who can answer my question, works for every other mod I play, I should have known how useless forums are in general.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>It’s not really that they made a “viewer” it’s more of they made it updateable ingame, if it’s not like that already.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thats why I want it. My current work flow is the following: change the name of the particle I want to edit in my test map with an info_particle_system placed somewhere in it. Then go into the tools, load the map, trial and error some values, Press F10, Press H for the binding to reset all particles, Press F10 again, Trial and error some value again, and repeat the F10 madness. So the workflow to play with particles could be improved a lot and from what I’ve seen from that youtube video, the work flow of the bms particle editor looks a lot better. Thats why I’m interested in it.</p>
