    <title>Virtual Reality - The Oculus Rift</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/virtual-reality-the-oculus-rift/9115</link>
    <description>I stumbled upon this little Kickstarter project that&#39;s been going on for a while now.  You may have heard of it but I didn&#39;t see a thread on this so here you go: [url]https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game[/url]


So it&#39;s essentially a really cool Virtual Reality visor thing that&#39;s in development.  Seems like it may be on of the first [i]true [/i]visors in development.  What really got me interested (no surprise here) was the Gabe Newell and Michael Abrash both made an appearance in the video.  Especially since Valve has seemed to be pretty big on wearable computing lately  I don&#39;t think the two projects are related, but it&#39;s still  pretty cool.  Anyone feel like buying a dev kit just to toy with it?</description>

            <p>I wonder what kind of resolution the final release is gonna have. Or if there’s going to be multiple models with multiple resolutions/ prices.</p>

            <p>Yeah, seems like it’s more of an immsersion-enhancer than an actual control-changer. Which is a big plus, I think.</p>
<p>Though I do hope that this means the Dark Mod and Thief 4 will let me lean to peak around corners.</p>

<p>It’s supposed to be implemented so that the mouse/controller moves your aim and view like normal, but you also get x amount of degrees on each axis (hopefully, including z) that are controlled by the Rift.</p>
<p>The rift doesn’t move the gun, but the view from the perspective of the player character.</p>

            <p>Honestly if this turns out well it would be a great excuse to get the Doom3 BFG edition, and I would probably buy it on day 1.</p>

            <p>I was just about to start this thread. Since it has both John Carmack’s &amp; Gabe Newell’s approval, it certainly has my interest. Hell, it might be a day-one buy depending on the price.</p>

<p>I doubt that head-tracking will be the sole method of looking around. Not everybody has a wireless keyboard, wireless mouse &amp; swivel chair to work with.</p>
<p>Edit: They should add stereoscopic cameras on the outside so it could be used for augmented reality.</p>
