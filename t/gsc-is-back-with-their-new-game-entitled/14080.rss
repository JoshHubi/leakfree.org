    <description>Cossacks 3!

Never expected this to happen but that&#39;s pretty cool. It says it should be out by the end of the year.

They&#39;re essentially keeping the gameplay the same as the original but in 3D and with new campaigns. Also day one mod tools. This actually makes me hopeful for a new Stalker game since doing this shows that they haven&#39;t abandoned their PC audience like so many other devs.

Edit: They just put up a site for the game today I think. And with more info and bullet points.
