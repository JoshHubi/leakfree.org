    <title>Music and Map Transitions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/music-and-map-transitions/12535</link>
    <description>One thing that&#39;s always annoyed me (especially in the HL2 games) is how the music stops at loading screens. The worst part is that, often, when the next map loads, you are often continuing the same action that the music scored in the last map, yet now you&#39;re music-less.

I know even Valve&#39;s more current games like Portal 2 have this issue (even though, they are gracious enough to let the music fade out instead of it just suddenly stopping), and I noticed how Black Mesa skirted the issue by timing the tracks and designing the maps so that the song is guaranteed to be finished by the time the next map transition hits (if the game is played as intended). Joel also split the Inbound theme into 3 parts for the same reason.

I&#39;ve heard that the reason this happens is because the sounds are linked to the maps, so when a new map loads, the sound isn&#39;t in that new map, thus it stops. I&#39;m not sure if this really is the issue, but I just wanted to bring it up.

Valve &quot;recently&quot; updated the Steam version of Half-Life (Goldsrc version) to now play music through the map transitions. Is this possible in the Source engine? And if so, if somebody could point me in the right direction to fixing it, that&#39;d be tremendous. Even if it involves writing a CD with the music on it, or something like that.

TL;DR: I hate it when music stops at level transitions. Why does this happen, and how can I fix it?

Thanks!

<p>It would just replay the music from the beginning.</p>
<p>The best way to do it, is to create a looping music that plays right after the level changes.</p>

<p>I believe the problem has to do with it being the same ‘trigger’ for both reloading of map and loading of next map.</p>
<p>If it is loading of the next map it isnt a problem, but if you do a reload of a map because you died, you now may face hearing the middle to ending of a song as well as an overlapping restart of the song.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, I can see how this’d be a problem. In the HL2 games (last I checked), when you die during a song, if you reload to a time after the song trigger, but before the song ends (or the map changes) the song will just not play on your reload.</p>
<p>I never minded this too much, because it’s like a reward for completing the section the first time. What I don’t like, however, if the “punishment” for finishing the map quickly (having the song stop abruptly)</p>
<p>As for the songs overlapping, in my reading on FMOD, there is a “is sound playing” type command, so I could theoretically have it check if the song is playing already, and have it not play the song again, That that be the case. I may also be able to rig up a way for the song to stop playing when the player dies. That should clear up the issue of reloading the same map, and loading the next map being the same trigger!</p>
<p>I don’t really know for sure at this point. I’m still trying to figure out where to start!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
I’m gonna keep on poking around for info, of course, but does anyone know where the  code<br>
that handles music queues is located, or if I’ll have to decompile the maps and edit the triggers in there?</p>

<p>True, the music could be too long. But Vortal Combat is too long for where it plays too (episode 2, fighting off antlions with griggs and sheckley). This could be solved like they did there; have the music fade out after making it through the battle.</p>

<p>Yes, on further inspection, it is. I only skimmed the page before, but I got to read it all of the way through today. I do know how to do <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> programming, but these are unfamiliar, and vast waters. :fffuuu:</p>
<p>From what I can gather, all of the music and sounds in Source are played through it’s proprietary(?) sound system, “Miles”. “FMOD” is a separate program that runs at the same time as the game, and the game can send out commands to FMOD telling it what to do. I don’t want to re-do and port Half-Life 2s entire audio system, because the sound effects and voices are fine. I just want to move the <span class="bbcode-i">soundtrack</span> to FMOD, which I assume requires me to remove the soundtrack queues from Miles, and have it call FMOD instead. I probably need to grab the MP3s out of the old GCFs and store those separately in an accessible location. I doubt that FMOD knows how to read files from GCFs or VPKs.</p>
<p>Again, any insight or pointers are welcome, and if anyone knows a useful website or page, that’d be awesome! I’ll be doing plenty of digging on my own as well, of course.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I do the same thing… except I kind of like the music in the elevator… I kind of feel like that music represents the chaos on the surface… Chaos I am leaving behind… Besides, having the doors open to that pool of toxic goo kind of makes it feel like the pressure’s still on… I dunno.

<p>Now, what is FMOD? Because, Black Mesa was designed with the idea of not letting the tracks reach the end of a map… Half-Life 2 was not. I’m more looking to fix HL2 (+episodes) rather than BM.

<p>Then again, this is referring to making mods…  but I’m trying to mod HL2, not make a standalone mod… Furthur reading is required!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>One thing that’s always annoyed me (especially in the HL2 games) is how the music stops at loading screens. The worst part is that, often, when the next map loads, you are often continuing the same action that the music scored in the last map, yet now you’re music-less.</p>
<p>I know even Valve’s more current games like Portal 2 have this issue (even though, they are gracious enough to let the music fade out instead of it just suddenly stopping), and I noticed how Black Mesa skirted the issue by timing the tracks and designing the maps so that the song is guaranteed to be finished by the time the next map transition hits (if the game is played as intended). Joel also split the Inbound theme into 3 parts for the same reason.</p>
<p>I’ve heard that the reason this happens is because the sounds are linked to the maps, so when a new map loads, the sound isn’t in that new map, thus it stops. I’m not sure if this really is the issue, but I just wanted to bring it up.</p>
<p>Valve “recently” updated the Steam version of Half-Life (Goldsrc version) to now play music through the map transitions. Is this possible in the Source engine? And if so, if somebody could point me in the right direction to fixing it, that’d be tremendous. Even if it involves writing a CD with the music on it, or something like that.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I hate it when music stops at level transitions. Why does this happen, and how can I fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
