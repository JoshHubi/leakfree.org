    <title>SUGGESTION: get some donation for this AWESOME Work</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestion-get-some-donation-for-this-awesome-work/10198</link>
    <description>I wouldn&#39;t say BMS is a Mod, its a full flagedet Game. And its awesome.
May be remake but mind blowing.

And its FREE.
But their hard work MUST be rewarded.

[b][COLOR=&#39;Yellow&#39;]IDEA[/b]: Please create a Red Bill&#39;s TF2 Hat and sell it for $5. We will all buy and support.

            <p>The devs can’t and won’t take donations since HL is not their intellectual property. If you really want to give money, give it to a charity, they need it more than we do.</p>
