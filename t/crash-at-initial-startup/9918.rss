    <title>Crash at initial startup</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-at-initial-startup/9918</link>
    <description>I installed the mod, as well as 2007 SDK and started the game up flawlessly; I went to change the resolution of the game and as soon as I did it crashed. I proceeded to start it up again but it loaded a black screen then appeared to minimize in the bottom right of my monitor and then close. I proceeded to uninstall it and reinstall it but it still gives me the same problem with the crash on the startup.

I&#39;ve attempted to reinstall 2007 SDK and Mesa multiple times.</description>
