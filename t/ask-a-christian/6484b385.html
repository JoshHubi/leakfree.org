<p>So, these people basically did whatever they wanted with no regard for morality. Technically, they were nihilists, but their acts of moral freedom were mostly limited to heavy drinking, sexual immorality, expressions of disrespect for social convention and protocol, etc. There is a name for this group, but I forget it at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They were called libertines.</p>
<p>Anyway, as for free will, according to St. John of Damascus, God “knows all things beforehand, but He does not predetermine them. Although He knows what is in our power, He does not predetermine it”.  Man is free because he was created in “the image of God”.</p>
<p>Just because you know something in the future is going to happen that does not mean you caused it to happen.  Granted, we, in our limited capacity, cannot know the future, but if you did reason your way to a prediction about what will happen, if you’re right, you aren’t the reason it happened.  God’s omniscience and human free-will are not contradictory.  Knowledge does not necessarily employ force, nor come from force.  It’s simply knowledge.  Just because it’s hard/confusing to see the consistency does not mean it isn’t there, especially when you’re theory relies on it being inconsistent/contradictory.  So God knew you were going to be a fuck-up when he decided to create you, that doesn’t mean he made you to be a fuck-up, merely that he knew the circumstances of your life and the choices you would make.  The question that you’re really trying to ask is not “then, how am I free?”, but rather “then, why did He make me?”.  That’s a really dumb question to ask, to yourself or another human, at least.</p>
<p>That leads me to my next point, all this debate is centering on something that IS contradictory.  According to the scriptures and Christians, God is perfect, infinite and a bunch of other really fun words, yet we are imperfect beings and seemingly finite in this life.  This means that we can’t possibly understand anything God does as His perfection is beyond our imperfect capacities.  This is a double-edged sword, though, because now we can’t accurately reason about God.  We can try, but we can’t really hold anything true in light of our reasoning.  This is the distinction between reason and faith.  God is illogical, I’ll give you guys that, but just because something is illogical does not mean that it is wrong.  It just means that it is not bound by the rules of logic.  It’s important to note here that according to logic, logic itself can logically be false.  It is rooted in postulations.  Philosopher/logicians have been trying to prove logic for the past 200 years, so far to no avail.  All we can think to know is that logic looks like it’s right (I’m not saying it’s wrong either.  In fact, I think it’s the best tool that will probably ever be available to us, given our capacities).</p>
<p>What’s the case for this perfect/imperfect finite/infinite distinction?  It’s simple, can we know everything?  Can we even know anything for certain?  How is it that we can even understand a concept like ‘certain’ when we seem to be incapable of it?  The same goes for perfection and infinity.  Infinity is a great example actually.  We can kind of realize that there is an infinite, yet given its definition, there is no way that we could probably prove it exist.  In order to prove it, you must show everything that makes up infinity, which is impossible.  We use ∞ as a cop-out because we really have no idea.</p>
<p>Everything that we hold a belief about is going to be rooted in some degree of faith somewhere along the line.  That degree of faith is logically unprovable, yet we still hold beliefs.  I believe I’m typing on a laptop right now because I’m using my senses to figure that out, however, how do I know my senses are right?  They fuck up quite a bit.  I believe, hypothetically, in evolution/big bang theory, but how the shit did the big bang happen?  Fuck if I know, we haven’t figured it out yet, BUT WE WILL.  ORLY, how do you know that you will one day without employing faith?  As it stands, big bang theory basically says that everything today came out of the “explosion” of something.  Well, where the fuck did that something come from and why did it explode?  WHERE DID YOUR GOD COME FROM. :fffuuu:  Right, the distinction here is that those who have faith realize that we have a limited capacity for knowledge and that get the feeling that there are some things that we’ll never know for certain using reason.  For those things, some, including myself, think it’s appropriate to employ faith.  Atheists say faith is stupid, but I counter by saying that so is the big bang theory until it makes some fucking sense.  Furthermore, faith does not require anything additional, you can’t disprove a matter of faith because of something else, because faith is a belief of something without regard to any proof/evidence, so no evidence should technically affect it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr:</span> Christians/scripture say God is perfect and humans are imperfect.  Imperfection cannot understand something more perfect than it–namely perfection.  So, you’re all cocks arguing about something that will never get anywhere due directly to the definition of those two terms. :jizz:</p>
<p>On that note, I’m going to start rambling and write this ridiculously overdue paper. :retard:</p>

          <p>You don’t see that there is no point in placing a god there at the big bang, answering a question with another even more nonsensical question.</p>
<p>Even if, for sake of argument, a god did cause the big bang, what gives you any idea that it was the god of christianity?</p>
<p>The bible itself has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnnWbkMlbg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">refuted</a> quite a few times in this very thread.</p>
<p>You are essentially using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZpJ7yUPwdU" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pascal’s wager argument</a> which is also invalid, because there are so many different versions of christianity, not to mention that it doesn’t disprove any other god from other religions.</p>

          <p>I didn’t say that a God is needed for the big bang, just that it contradicts current accepted laws of physics: the Law of Conservation of Mass.  Quantum physics/mechanics is trying to get around that, but it hasn’t–yet, at least.  Until it does, it just doesn’t make sense.  Even then, who knows if it will.  I’d really like to see how they’ll explain that something came from nothing.  From my perspective, that centers on something which is beyond human cognition.</p>
<p>Secondly, you cannot refute a matter of faith by its very definition.  Faith can only be accepted or abandoned by the individual holder of said faith.  You can, however, argue when faith is and isn’t appropriate, and if it is or isn’t, but that–theoretically–would have no effect on anyone’s faith, as arguing uses reason.</p>
<p>Thirdly, similarities don’t mean they came from the same a different source.  Much like in science, correlation does not mean causation.  Also, just because there is a purported lack of monotheistic beliefs in that area during that time does not mean there weren’t any.  It only means that we haven’t found any.  Is it an alternate, reasoned theory?  Sure it is.  Does that mean it’s correct?  No.  Providing an alternate theory is not refutation.  There are even plenty of counter-theories to that alternate theory.</p>

<p>They were called libertines.</p>
<p>Anyway, as for free will, according to St. John of Damascus, God “knows all things beforehand, but He does not predetermine them. Although He knows what is in our power, He does not predetermine it”.  Man is free because he was created in “the image of God”.</p>
<p>Just because you know something in the future is going to happen that does not mean you caused it to happen.  Granted, we, in our limited capacity, cannot know the future, but if you did reason your way to a prediction about what will happen, if you’re right, you aren’t the reason it happened.  God’s omniscience and human free-will are not contradictory.  Knowledge does not necessarily employ force, nor come from force.  It’s simply knowledge.  Just because it’s hard/confusing to see the consistency does not mean it isn’t there, especially when you’re theory relies on it being inconsistent/contradictory.  So God knew you were going to be a fuck-up when he decided to create you, that doesn’t mean he made you to be a fuck-up, merely that he knew the circumstances of your life and the choices you would make.  The question that you’re really trying to ask is not “then, how am I free?”, but rather “then, why did He make me?”.  That’s a really dumb question to ask, to yourself or another human, at least.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the counter to that is supposed to be that if everything you ever will do, or decide is predetermined ( knowing all past and future simultaneously means that the linear nature of time as we know it doesn’t apply ). If everything that you will ever do is determined BEFORE you were even born, then what will of yours was there? Unless you argue for infinite possibilities that you COULD have accomplished but because of the choices you make, you are who you ended up being, there never was choice. You simply played your part while only perceiving your timeline in a linear way. Unless you argue for a branching reality, there never was free will. Just the illusion of it.</p>
<p>Again, this is ALL academic because there is no evidence either way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That leads me to my next point, all this debate is centering on something that IS contradictory.  According to the scriptures and Christians, God is perfect, infinite and a bunch of other really fun words, yet we are imperfect beings and seemingly finite in this life.  This means that we can’t possibly understand anything God does as His perfection is beyond our imperfect capacities.  This is a double-edged sword, though, because now we can’t accurately reason about God.  We can try, but we can’t really hold anything true in light of our reasoning.  This is the distinction between reason and faith.  God is illogical, I’ll give you guys that, but just because something is illogical does not mean that it is wrong.  It just means that it is not bound by the rules of logic.  It’s important to note here that according to logic, logic itself can logically be false.  It is rooted in postulations.  Philosopher/logicians have been trying to prove logic for the past 200 years, so far to no avail.  All we can think to know is that logic looks like it’s right (I’m not saying it’s wrong either.  In fact, I think it’s the best tool that will probably ever be available to us, given our capacities).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>All of this ( and I mean EVERY WORD ) is meaningless drivel. It simply has no place in a debate for the existence of a god. Saying that our logic may fail is one thing, but to argue that because a god might exist with an entirely different nature, and any influence such a being has on us or our universe imperceptible, than the existence of the being to us is meaningless. What is the point of discussing a being totally separate from us and any perceptible interaction? Your argument that reason fails is also ridiculous because it is based on the premise that it doesn’t change.</p>

<p>What’s the case for this perfect/imperfect finite/infinite distinction?  It’s simple, can we know everything?  Can we even know anything for certain?  How is it that we can even understand a concept like ‘certain’ when we seem to be incapable of it?  The same goes for perfection and infinity.  Infinity is a great example actually.  We can kind of realize that there is an infinite, yet given its definition, there is no way that we could probably prove it exist.  In order to prove it, you must show everything that makes up infinity, which is impossible.  We use ∞ as a cop-out because we really have no idea.</p>
<p>Everything that we hold a belief about is going to be rooted in some degree of faith somewhere along the line.  That degree of faith is logically unprovable, yet we still hold beliefs.  I believe I’m typing on a laptop right now because I’m using my senses to figure that out, however, how do I know my senses are right?  They fuck up quite a bit.  I believe, hypothetically, in evolution/big bang theory, but how the shit did the big bang happen?  Fuck if I know, we haven’t figured it out yet, BUT WE WILL.  ORLY, how do you know that you will one day without employing faith?  As it stands, big bang theory basically says that everything today came out of the “explosion” of something.  Well, where the fuck did that something come from and why did it explode?  WHERE DID YOUR GOD COME FROM. :fffuuu:  Right, the distinction here is that those who have faith realize that we have a limited capacity for knowledge and that get the feeling that there are some things that we’ll never know for certain using reason.  For those things, some, including myself, think it’s appropriate to employ faith.  Atheists say faith is stupid, but I counter by saying that so is the big bang theory until it makes some fucking sense.  Furthermore, faith does not require anything additional, you can’t disprove a matter of faith because of something else, because faith is a belief of something without regard to any proof/evidence, so no evidence should technically affect it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr:</span> Christians/scripture say God is perfect and humans are imperfect.  Imperfection cannot understand something more perfect than it–namely perfection.  So, you’re all cocks arguing about something that will never get anywhere due directly to the definition of those two terms. :jizz:</p>
<p>On that note, I’m going to start rambling and write this ridiculously overdue paper. :retard:</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This whole thing throws all useful information out the window. There is a MAJOR distinction between saying one doesn’t know and work towards understanding more, and simply saying something that could very well just be a made up concept is the answer and stop. You say our perceptions are flawed and our tools imperfect. But that doesn’t mean you throw the tools out and hope that the work does itself. You improve the tools to as much as possible to do the best you can. the very nature of our universe suggest that perfection doesn’t exist within it. So we may never reach perfection. Assuming that it does exist is flawed though. The proper approach would be to say we don’t know, but there is no suggestion that it does yet.</p>
<p>You seem to be approaching the whole concept cart before horse here.</p>

<p>I didn’t say that a God is needed for the big bang, just that it contradicts current accepted laws of physics: the Law of Conservation of Mass.  Quantum physics/mechanics is trying to get around that, but it hasn’t–yet, at least.  Until it does, it just doesn’t make sense.  Even then, who knows if it will.  I’d really like to see how they’ll explain that something came from nothing.  From my perspective, that centers on something which is beyond human cognition.</p>

          <p>Let me just note that my and daniel’s concerns regarding the relationship between God’s omniscience and free will are actually very known in philosophy and theology:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Wikipedia">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Wikipedia:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Some modern theologians argue that God’s omniscience is inherent rather than total, and that <span class="bbcode-b">God chooses to limit his omniscience in order to preserve the freewill</span> and dignity of his creatures.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Whether Omniscience, particularly regarding the choices that a human will make, is compatible with free will has been debated by theists and philosophers. The argument that divine foreknowledge is not compatible with free will is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_fatalism" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">theological fatalism</a>. Generally, if humans are truly free to choose between different alternatives, it is very difficult to understand how God could know what this choice will be.[4] Various responses have been proposed to this argument. One possible solution is that God could know every possible life you might live, but allows for free will according to laws set in place that cannot be contradicted. God would know all possible ways to live and all the outcomes, but a human being with free will would choose which specific life to actually live out, one decision at a time. God would allow for the ability to choose, and to not have full power over all in what was chosen by a human being each step of the way. God would be all knowing in terms of infinite specific details of every possible life you could live.</p>

</aside>
<p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience</a></p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_fatalism" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">theological fatalism</a> as well.</p>
<p>So, guys, stop saying “free will and omniscience are not contradictory, it is obvious”. It seems obvious for people that are not familiar with logic. The problem is that we did not give a specific logical definitions of free will nor omniscience. I have thought of a few possibilities, the only possible answer seems to be limiting God’s knowledge.</p>

          <p>Within the confines of ourselves, it appears that we have free will; that we use our knowledge to make what we perceive to be completely voluntary choices…whether to buy a game, whether to wear that shirt, whether to eat at 6:30PM instead of 7:00PM, what movie to watch in the theater, or whatever.</p>
<p>But, if God knows exactly what we’re going to do, we logically cannot make any other choice.  I could choose between seeing “Paul” or “Rango” in the theater, but if God knows that I’m going to see “Paul”, then it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to choose “Rango”.  It is an illusion of free choice.</p>
<p>I could not see “Rango” no matter what I do.  I may believe I can, but I can’t.  I may believe that I can buy the movie theater nachos, but if God knows I’m going to buy the large popcorn, then nachos was never an option, even though I believe it would be.</p>
<p>Understand?</p>

          <p>[color=red]Daniel. Thank you for so many good questions. Guess what. Youre right. You are so right. I think everything you ahve said here is completely and totally right. I wish more Christians understood this. Let me explain.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that free will simply does not exist, but it looks <span class="bbcode-i">a lot</span> like it is just an illusion.</p>
<p>It is actually very debatable whether we have free will or not, this is complicated.</p>

<p>Yes. It is a bit hard to understand how this works at first, almost seems like an illusion, thats not a bad way of describing this.</p>

<p>Good point bur. It was completely in the will of Adam and Eve to eat the fruit. They wanted to. Good distinction, this will come in handy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason I ask about “free will” is that a whole boatload of Christians have told me that the existence of evil is the result of “free will” and that “evil” didn’t exist before the expulsion from paradise; that it’s humanity’s fault.</p>
<p>Yet, if God was omniscient, God would know that Adam and Eve would betray Him in the Garden and eat from the tree…even before Genesis 1:1. Yet, He created them anyway and they did exactly what He knew they were going to do…and punished them anyway…and, by extension, all of us unless we join that religion and accept His son as our savior.</p>
<p>[color=red]So, it was God’s doing when Adam ate the apple, but its up to us the accept God? Not quite. Look at this in a second.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve had NO CHOICE but to eat from the tree. There is no free will if God is omniscient. So, do we have free will or is God not omniscient?</p>
<p>Or, what is “free will”, then?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Great question here. Do we have free will? Can we do something God does not already know we intend to do? No. Can we do anything that God has not already predetermined? … NO. (yes i admit it) so then is there free will? In a very important sense yes. I right now am choosing to type what Im typing. Of course im choosing to do this. Of course I am freely choosing to do this. Free will. I am responsible for this action of typing. So yes I have Free Will, and Im responsible for what I do. But did I just contradict myself? Lets keep going here.</p>

<p>Daniel it’s really not good to get hung up on one single logical fallacy when it comes to Christian religions. Save your energy. There is literally a whole book full of contradictions, logical fallacies, and outright fabrications to go through. You are going to give yourself an embolism or something, going on like this.</p>

<p>bur: Yet, the Bible states otherwise. The Bible states that God knows you before you’re born. So, God knows what you’re going to do prior to your birth. God knew that I would be eating pasta tonight (rotini-shaped!) even back before Genesis 1:1.</p>
<p>This is what the Bible states.</p>
<p>[color=red]its true! And such a blessing for us as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had no choice but to eat pasta tonight. I may think it’s based on free will; that I could’ve had the hot dogs or the mac and cheese, but I really didn’t have any choice in the matter.</p>
<p>I can’t do something that God doesn’t expect.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>[color=red]I think you pretty much got it here. Congrats. This is like a pretty tough concept and you reasoned through it remarkably well.</p>
<p>[color=black]Lets do a little recap here.<br>
Does God know everything that will happen? Even more so, is God in complete control over all actions.<br>
IF GOD WAS NOT IN CONTROL OF ALL THINGS, WE COULD HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THE FACT THAT ALL THINGS WORK FOR GOOD FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.</p>
<p>How could he possibly say this if we had complete free will to do whatever we want.</p>
<p>God has all authority on heaven and on earth. all of it. everything.<br>
Ill let you read this and take the multitude of questions that will follow.</p>

</aside>
<p>I have read your post with great interest and I thank you for your answers.</p>
<p>The problem I see here is that God knew you were going to type what you typed even before you were born.  I do see that you contradicted yourself and I don’t see where you had any choice in the matter.  Every letter that you typed or backspaced or deleted or anything else for that matter was predetermined, assuming God’s omniscience.</p>
<p>You say that we can’t do anything that God doesn’t already know about?  Then we don’t have free will.  If we turn away from God, such as Adam and Eve did when they ate from the tree, God knew that would happen before we were even born.</p>
<p>Basically, we were created to be punished.  That doesn’t, to me, sound like the workings of an “all-good” deity.  Does it to you?</p>
