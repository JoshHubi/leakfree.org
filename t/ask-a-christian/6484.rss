    <title>Ask a Christian</title>

    <description>Since people of other religions are doing this, I might as well give it a shot.
As for my religion, Christianity was summed up as this:



We believe in one God, 
the Father, the Almighty, 
maker of heaven and earth, 
of all that is, seen and unseen. 
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, 
the only Son of God, 
eternally begotten of the Father, 
God from God, Light from Light, 
true God from true God, 
begotten, not made, 
of one Being with the Father. 
Through him all things were made. 
For us and for our salvation 
he came down from heaven: 
by the power of the Holy Spirit 
he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary, 
and was made man. 
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; 
he suffered death and was buried. 
On the third day he rose again 
in accordance with the Scriptures; 
he ascended into heaven 
and is seated at the right hand of the Father. 
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, 
and his kingdom will have no end. 

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, 
who proceeds from the Father and the Son. 
With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified. 
He has spoken through the Prophets. 
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. 
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. 
We look for the resurrection of the dead, 
and the life of the world to come.

Feel free to ask any questions.</description>

<p>^Well said, yourself.<br>

But, let’s remember; if God is actually God, he has the right to determine the fates of the humans that he created, even if we don’t agree with him. Even if it is death-by-war-with-predetermined-victors or something of the sort. He doesn’t have to submit to “humans terms” of good or bad.</p>

</aside>
<p>The thing is: even if there is a God, I highly doubt he did those things that the bible says. I find it much more probable that the men who wrote the bible were trying to justify their own actions, just like other nations justified sacrificing kids saying it was their gods’ wishes.</p>
<p>According to Deuteronomy, some nation neighbor to Israel was sacrificing their own children to Baal, because Baal wanted them to, then Israel found that out and invaded that country sacrificing <span class="bbcode-i">everyone</span> to Yahweh, because Yahweh wanted them to. If Yahweh really wanted them to do that, then he is either a hypocrite or he doesn’t give a shit to the other nation, don’t you think? Because the other nation was just sacrificing some of their own kids, and Israel killed every single one of them.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if you are going to like to watch the following video, but it clarifies the context in which Deuteronomy and Leviticus were written:</p>

            <p>^ Well said.</p>
<p>Personal life experience can teach you a lot of things. It can help you understand the people around you, how they behave, what they think. But you have to take care about the conclusions that you make about other people, don’t you? You can’t jump into conclusions about people, you have to talk to them, ask their opinion and only then you can form an opinion yourself. Am I right?</p>
<p>If you have to take care about making conclusions about natural things, shouldn’t you care ten times more about the conclusions that you make about supernatural things? Imagine how much presumption it is to tell everyone that you know what God thinks, what he approves and what he doesn’t approve, what he is angry at and what he isn’t, why he created us, what he created us for, how and when he created us…</p>
<p>Would it be a big shame for you if that “voice” that talks to you in your mind isn’t God’s voice, but your own voice? Or if what you think to be God’s opinion is only your opinion, which you deify to make it more believable? Which would be worse: to die and tell God: “I’m sorry, but I didn’t know it was you saying that” or face God for having used his name to promote you own ideology in pretty much the same way that those people who tell everyone that they are “the return of Christ”?</p>
<p>If you don’t have enough knowledge to argue with a Physician about how atoms work, do you find yourself in the place to tell them how the universe was created? Doesn’t that require even more knowledge then the knowledge necessary to understand quantum physics?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I certainly wouldn’t get mad to the point of promoting war and tell “my people” to kill everyone in the countries they invade, including children. If you were in one of those wars and liked a woman in the country that you invaded, I also wouldn’t tell you that you could rape her after capturing her as a property and letting her mourn her parents for one month, and then authorize you to make her your own wife and leaving her after you get tired of her.</p>
<p>Yes, theoretically God should be patient enough to stand anything without losing his temper, but the god of the bible is bad even in (today’s) humans terms.</p>

            <p>Individual life experience:<br>
I was going through a citizenship test (it was one of those required tests you had to take to graduate).  The test was in a different portion of the school which I had never been to before, so I saw something completely different out the windows.  In the distance, above the treetops, I saw a silver sphere.  It seemed to be completely stationary.  I didn’t (and still don’t) know what it was but the test was starting so I had to concentrate on that.</p>
<p>I glanced up a couple times throughout the test and it hadn’t moved.  Maybe it was a water tower.  Maybe it was an advertising balloon.  I don’t know.</p>
<p>But, when I was done with the test and I had turned it in, I returned to my seat waiting to be dismissed (you had to stay until the 2 hours was over), and looked out the window.</p>
<p>The sphere wasn’t there anymore.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t know what happened to it and still don’t.</p>
<p>However, let’s now say that I believed in space aliens and that they visit Earth.  I would probably take this “life experience” as evidence that aliens are visiting Earth and insist that “I know what I saw”.</p>
<p>But I don’t.</p>
<p>It could’ve been an advertising balloon that was brought down or floated away. The point is, I don’t know…but I’d insist that I would know what it was if I already “pre-believed” in it.</p>

<p>Because they can’t.  There is nothing to understand about it. Individual life experience proves nothing. Maybe you do not understand what “proving something” actually means.</p>

<p>Assassin:</p>
<p>I have a guy that I’d like your daughter to meet. I know you have high expectations for her happiness and I didn’t want you to think I was just trying to fix her up with just some big loser so, let me tell you a little bit about him.</p>
<p>He has a temper and has been known to throw fits of rage.<br>
He is jealous.<br>
He has slaughtered men women and children.<br>
He has ordered his armies to rape and pillage.<br>
He has a son that he killed<br>
and he really likes the smell of burning flesh.</p>
<p>Isn’t he just the perfect kind of guy you would want your 16 year old daughter to meet? When should I have him drop by?</p>

<p>That video shows how to “cure” deafness, blindness and even how to make the shorter leg of a person to grow.</p>
<p>The most upsetting thing in the video is what one of the founders of Trinity Foundation said:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<pre><code>She had a thirteen year old daughter who had multiple sclerosis, and there was a testimonial...where a woman had made a thousand dollar vow of faith and, supposedly, was healed of multiple sclerosis. Of course it was an actor that did it. And so she, unbeknownst to her mother over the course of the year, paid off the thousand dollars - mostly from her grandmother.

So at the end of that year when she'd finally paid it all off, she wasn't healed - she was far worse. She called the man of God that told her she would be healed, and he told her that... the reason she wasn't healed was that she had secret sin in her life. And this little girl, now fourteen, went to the back yard and poured a can of gas over herself and lit herself, and committed suicide. And the mother just begged me to do something about this.

            <p>Jesus said in Matthew 5:17-18 that he did not come to abolish the Old Testament laws but to fulfill them and they wouldn’t be fulfilled until Heaven and Earth “disappear” (Judgment Day).</p>
<p>As far as I know, the Earth has not yet “disappeared” so the Law has not yet been fulfilled.  Or am I reading it wrong?</p>

<p>That isn’t favoritism??</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Haha, thats great. Good point. Yes God chose a certain people group as part of the Old Covenant. But now as the New Covenant God opened that up to Jews and Gentiles, which was a pretty big deal. No more is there a special people. So in this current age, it doesnt matter. But yes good point.</p>
<p>As a side note, salvation has always been through faith. There are examples of non-Jews being saved in the OT. The NT is not a new way to salvation.</p>

<p>Once more, I’m not trying to prove anything.  I want YOU to provide a reason for why you believe in the Christian deity and the characteristics you ascribe to this deity versus the thousands of other deities out there.  I am “ask(ing) a Christian”.</p>
<p>If you want me to discuss my atheism and want me to try to prove things, there’s a thread for that.  This is your thread, Assassin; yours and any other Christian’s.</p>
<p>Like I said, I’m not trying to prove anything.  I’m just asking questions.  Your “disagreement” isn’t advancing the discussion but if, in the discussion, you say something like “2+2=5”, then I’m going to call you on that.</p>

<p>That is not hard to do. It is actually simple to consider what the person is saying for what the one is saying, not for who one is or what one believes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdt9CPAipA4" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here is the proof that even Christians can do that</a>.</p>
<p>If you say I’m a hypocrite because I don’t value your opinion, well, that is because your opinion don’t sound reasonable to me. However, I value the opinions of the priest Fabio de Mello and the pastor Rob Bell (which doesn’t mean I agree with <span class="bbcode-i">everything</span> they say). Also, the Christian that talks in the video above seems to be a very reasonable person as well.</p>

</aside>
<p>As I said above, I don’t think that “people who believe in god are blind idiots”. There are people (like you) that I consider to be blind, but that is <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> because they believe in some god. Fancy Pants is an example of someone who is atheist and that I consider to be blind.</p>
<p>All the proof that you might have that I don’t want to find the proof is that I disagree with you, as if you were the holder of the truth. Like I said, I don’t believe in what you say, that is all.</p>
<p>Finally, I did not request a 1000 word post from you, you were the one to request us to provide the whole context of the verses we quoted, which means, at least, the entire book (not the bible, just the book) we are quoting from. I just asked for you to show how one can do that.</p>
