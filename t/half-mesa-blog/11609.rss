    <description>Since I have taken over 14,000 screenshots during my gaming in [b]Black Mesa [/b]and I&#39;m a bit of a creative/arty dude by nature I&#39;ve decided to make a complete set of photo composites of [b]Half-Life/Black Mesa [/b]and share the results of this experiment with anyone who cares to check it out.

I&#39;ve made composites all the way through [b]We&#39;ve Got Hostiles[/b] but I&#39;ve only just now started uploading them to my newest blog.

Feel free to stop on by.

It&#39;s been quite a lot of fun and I hope you get a kick out of my fannish excess.
