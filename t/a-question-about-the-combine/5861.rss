    <title>A question about the Combine</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-question-about-the-combine/5861</link>
    <description>I have heard for awhile now that the Combine are human. I have seen a picture of a combine soldier without his armor on the top, but I couldn&#39;t tell if it was real.

I do know for a fact that they are part flesh and part mechanical/ synthetic. But are they kind of like the Chimera (Resistance)? Once human, now Alien/ Robot things?
[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]SPOILER (if you havn&#39;t played ep1)[/SIZE]

 Then only time (in-game) that you hear about transforming humans to combine is when you are with Alyx in the Stalker car. She says &quot;This is what happens when you resist...&quot; 

Do they turn them into soldiers to? Or are they volunteer Humans, who realized the fight was over? that giving up and joining the winning side would be the better choice? you never see a unarmored Combine Soldier anywhere.

Could they possibley be dead humans, brought back to life to do the Combines bidding? Wired with a AI brain, and controlled by the Advisors? The advisors seem to have a strong, telekinetic power of some sort...</description>

            <p>The Combine are a faction of bad guys that take over alien planets and milk them to death.</p>
<p>Combine soldiers are human beings that have been conscripted, brainwashed, and enhanced with cybernetic components.</p>
<p>Combine Metropolice are regular human beings that join up with the Combine so they can beat people up and get decent meals and simulated sex with synth babes.</p>

<p>The Combine are an intergalactic alien force that conquer worlds and use whatever they find in those world for their own use.</p>
<p>When they conquered Earth, they started using humans for their own cause, either by hiring normal humans for urban security (Metrocops) or actually genetically modify them for the elite squads (Elite soldiers). If you are captured by the combine and resist their brainwashing, you are eventually transformed into a Stalker.</p>
<p>It’s assumed that most of the synth enemies, like the Striders or Hunters are actually based on beings from other worlds they had conquered previously.</p>

            <p>The Combine are an intergalactic alien force that conquer worlds and use whatever they find in those world for their own use.</p>
<p>When they conquered Earth, they started using humans for their own cause, either by hiring normal humans for urban security (Metrocops) or actually genetically modify them for the elite squads (Elite soldiers). If you are captured by the combine and resist their brainwashing, you are eventually transformed into a Stalker.</p>
<p>It’s assumed that most of the synth enemies, like the Striders or Hunters are actually based on beings from other worlds they had conquered previously.</p>

            <p>I have heard for awhile now that the Combine are human. I have seen a picture of a combine soldier without his armor on the top, but I couldn’t tell if it was real.</p>
<p>I do know for a fact that they are part flesh and part mechanical/ synthetic. But are they kind of like the Chimera (Resistance)? Once human, now Alien/ Robot things?<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]SPOILER (if you havn’t played ep1)[/SIZE]</p>
<p>Then only time (in-game) that you hear about transforming humans to combine is when you are with Alyx in the Stalker car. She says “This is what happens when you resist…”</p>
<p>Do they turn them into soldiers to? Or are they volunteer Humans, who realized the fight was over? that giving up and joining the winning side would be the better choice? you never see a unarmored Combine Soldier anywhere.</p>
<p>Could they possibley be dead humans, brought back to life to do the Combines bidding? Wired with a AI brain, and controlled by the Advisors? The advisors seem to have a strong, telekinetic power of some sort…</p>
