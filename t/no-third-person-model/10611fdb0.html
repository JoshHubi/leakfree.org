<p>If this game would have a 3rd person, it would only improve it, with no damage to it whatsoever. So why are you against it? Why so not understanding? Why the patronizing tone? It is a fact that 1st person is nauseating to some. Game developers could show some simpathy. It would also earn them some money.</p>

<p>It’s not lack of understanding, it’s logic. Developers could do it. All games could feature every single type of view there is, but do you actually think there’s an actual sizable demand for such? You may be vocal but you only represent a very small minority. Black Mesa in particular is not being made by a big AAA studio with lots of resources. This mod/game has literally been 10 years in the making and it’s still not finished. Do you really think they’re willing to go out of their way to implement a feature that has no demand? Game development is neither easy or fast, so you gotta prioritize what’s important. Duke Nukem Forever is a good example of a game that was grossly mismanaged and took more than 20 years to come out and it was terrible anyway.</p>
<p>Black Mesa is a first person shooter and doesn’t need to be anything else.</p>
<p>However, there’s always mods.</p>

<p>The simple fact is that you need to learn to cope with your limitations.</p>
<p>There seems to be this individualistic tendency seeping through American culture (and some others) that everything must fit one’s precise needs, and <span class="bbcode-i">right now</span>! Without going down the political path (political discussions derail threads faster than anything), I will simply say that I see this trend all the time when working as a computer and network technician. The consumer (business or otherwise) expects everything to work cohesively and without a hitch, all the time. This is simply unfeasible.</p>
<p>So, too, is your apparent assumption that video games in 2015 must cater to everyone. It’s unfortunate that you have this limitation, but we all have some form of limitation. I can’t read more than a couple hours without having to take a break–I take those breaks because, if I fail to, I will get a pounding migraine. Now, do I insist that all books must adjust themselves to fit my need? No. I simply take the necessary steps to alleviate the problem.</p>
<p>It also seems to me that you are focusing on your video gaming as being a need, rather than a desire. If you <span class="bbcode-i">needed</span> to play video games to survive or maintain your career, it’s a pretty safe bet that the Black Mesa team would find some way to accommodate you. However, you simply <span class="bbcode-i">want</span> to play, and in a manner that is most conducive to your enjoyment. Since pleasing everyone is ultimately impossible, I think it’s safe to assume that your plea is both unfounded and unlikely to be accommodated.</p>
<p>That said, if you would like some suggestions for games that have either strictly third-person mode or utilize both first-person and third-person, I’m sure you can start a thread in The Cafeteria. One upcoming game that is sure to rattle your jimmies is MGSV.</p>
