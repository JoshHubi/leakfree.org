    <title>No Third Person Model?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-third-person-model/10611</link>
    <description>Great mod.  Loving it.  Although to see that there is no third person model for Gordon was disappointing.  You have all these great models in the game, but Gordon himself never was created.  Seems..... off.  Plus playing in third person mode would have been fun, but as of right now the model for Gordon is just a grey figure with no animations tied to it.

Also for anyone that doesn&#39;t know how to go third person type the following in console.

sv_cheats 1
thirdperson  (or thirdperson_mayamode or thirdpersonshoulder)  All are different view points.</description>

        <title>No Third Person Model?</title>

<p>The simple fact is that you need to learn to cope with your limitations.</p>
<p>There seems to be this individualistic tendency seeping through American culture (and some others) that everything must fit one’s precise needs, and <span class="bbcode-i">right now</span>! Without going down the political path (political discussions derail threads faster than anything), I will simply say that I see this trend all the time when working as a computer and network technician. The consumer (business or otherwise) expects everything to work cohesively and without a hitch, all the time. This is simply unfeasible.</p>
<p>So, too, is your apparent assumption that video games in 2015 must cater to everyone. It’s unfortunate that you have this limitation, but we all have some form of limitation. I can’t read more than a couple hours without having to take a break–I take those breaks because, if I fail to, I will get a pounding migraine. Now, do I insist that all books must adjust themselves to fit my need? No. I simply take the necessary steps to alleviate the problem.</p>
<p>It also seems to me that you are focusing on your video gaming as being a need, rather than a desire. If you <span class="bbcode-i">needed</span> to play video games to survive or maintain your career, it’s a pretty safe bet that the Black Mesa team would find some way to accommodate you. However, you simply <span class="bbcode-i">want</span> to play, and in a manner that is most conducive to your enjoyment. Since pleasing everyone is ultimately impossible, I think it’s safe to assume that your plea is both unfounded and unlikely to be accommodated.</p>
<p>That said, if you would like some suggestions for games that have either strictly third-person mode or utilize both first-person and third-person, I’m sure you can start a thread in The Cafeteria. One upcoming game that is sure to rattle your jimmies is MGSV.</p>

<p>If this game would have a 3rd person, it would only improve it, with no damage to it whatsoever. So why are you against it? Why so not understanding? Why the patronizing tone? It is a fact that 1st person is nauseating to some. Game developers could show some simpathy. It would also earn them some money.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s not lack of understanding, it’s logic. Developers could do it. All games could feature every single type of view there is, but do you actually think there’s an actual sizable demand for such? You may be vocal but you only represent a very small minority. Black Mesa in particular is not being made by a big AAA studio with lots of resources. This mod/game has literally been 10 years in the making and it’s still not finished. Do you really think they’re willing to go out of their way to implement a feature that has no demand? Game development is neither easy or fast, so you gotta prioritize what’s important. Duke Nukem Forever is a good example of a game that was grossly mismanaged and took more than 20 years to come out and it was terrible anyway.</p>
<p>Black Mesa is a first person shooter and doesn’t need to be anything else.</p>
<p>However, there’s always mods.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Because of all the enclosed spaces, I don’t think Third Person would be a good fit for the game. It’d be very hard to get a camera angle that would allow you to see stuff, say, inside vents without clipping through the side of the map. Said camera would also have to be programmed with what amounts to an AI so it can follow the player and change angles and such, again, intelligently and without clipping through the map. Nobody wants bad camera angles. The character model would not only have to be modeled, it would have to be animated, and probably with more detailed animations than the multiplayer ones have to keep people from complaining. And even when all that work is done, there’s really no guarantee that BM would even be any fun as a third person shooter- while they’re very similar in concept, the gameplay is actually quite different between the two genres simply because of where the camera positions are - what might be fun in one would be boring or even infuriating in another.<br>
That’s not to say that good hybrid FPS-TPS games haven’t been done, but it takes a lot of work and usually you have to design the game with both in mind from the get-go for it to be decent.</p>
<p>It sucks that you have such bad movement sickness, but third person probably isn’t going to come out for BM, especially considering the small size of the team. Rockstar managed to get both TP and FP views in GTAV, but they had thousands of people working on the game, and it wasn’t even included in the original releases.</p>
<p>Have you maybe tried adjusting the game settings in regards to the view roll (which no doubt contributes <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span>) and the FOV? (Black Mesa and Advanced Video settings, respectively) I’m also pretty sure you can adjust the latter further than the slider allows with the console command “fov 120” (120 being an example value, no idea if that would be better or worse for you)</p>

<p>Yeah, but like you said, it wasn’t designed for such a gameplay. The controls didn’t even work properly.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that, man. But yeah, rule <span class="hashtag">#1</span> of Half-Life is that the entire game is ALWAYS in first person. It’s honestly part of the appeal to a lot of people.</p>
<p>I will ask, have you tried cranking up the FOV? I’ve heard that has helped a lot of people with motion sickness issues.</p>

<p>Whoa, why are you so angry is something I cannot understand.</p>
<p>Neither HL1 nor BM were designed for a 3rd person gameplay/perspective whatsoever, so there’s no point to add such a model/feature. It’s as simple as that.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This discussion is moot because adding Gordon’s body to the first person is absolutely NOT a trivial matter, in any way, shape or form. People who are saying that are very much underestimating what is required to make it work and look good. And obviously we would not add it in if it does not work or look good. So it’s not going to happen.</p>
<p>It would require us to almost entirely rework the way in which viewmodels work - the hands are currently a part of every individual weapon model, not some separate thing. That alone is prohibitive. Not to mention needing a super detailed model (anything first person HAS to be much more detailed than anything in the world, by virtue of being in your face and not occupying physical space in the world). Or the clipping, from looking down - or how things are connected. Changing how Gordon lowers his weapon. Or how his feet pose when on a slope, climbing up things. Or every single reload animation, so if you’re looking down it’s not like he conjures a magazine out of thin air. Or how the suit zoom interacts with his body.</p>
<p>Still sound simple? We could work out some kind of janky, half-arsed implementation, but why would we want to do that for a feature that wasn’t even in HL1 and nobody really expects anyway?</p>
<p>A simpler argument is that it’s not Half-Life.</p>

            <p>I think in a game where you use your legs for more than running and jumping, they could help. Otherwise, they don’t really contribute much. In Mirror’s Edge for example, the legs are used to help convey the expansive movement and make sure there’s no confusion as to what’s going on (running up a wall for instance). In a game like Half-Life (or Black Mesa), the movement is so simplistic that legs don’t really serve any purpose other than “Look! Legs! Super-real grampfics!” Even in Mirror’s Edge, though, simply walking and changing direction looked odd because animation is apparently no so great, yet.</p>

<p>I guess that means you’ve never played FEAR or Mirror’s Edge. In FEAR, not only is the main character able to kick, but he is able to cast real-time shadows. Not having legs would make shadows look really odd. And in Mirror’s Edge, not only is the main character able to kick, but maneuvers like sliding naturally put the character’s legs in view of the camera. Without legs, a lot of the character’s actions would look really weird.</p>

<p>F.E.A.R is the only first person shooter with legs in my opinion that was able to pull it off well. (The graphics in F.E.A.R also still look nice for a 10 year old game) The Black Mesa team on the other hand is to busy to add such a trivial mechanic to the game, but some modders might be able to do it.</p>

<p>In my opinion, legs in FPS are horrible. They are completely anti-inmersive.</p>

<p>Truth be told i got to wear that occulas rift a couple of days ago… And I</p>
<p>immediateley thought of Black Mesa and source 2013 compatibility.</p>
<p>Not sure about this motion control razer hyra seems over compllicated for the sake of it and we are told “that it is really good” but to me not only looks like shit but also can imagine having to go through this control scheme to a means to an end as labourious and annoying Sorry but for me I don’t mind putfing on a vr headset but the control sceme shoul feel familiar. this razer hydra thing is out in the cold as far as i am concerned and does not seem to offer anything positivd as it seems to be crowbaring in on the experience not that i tried this but i don’t like it.</p>
<p>What confuses me even more is why valve are striving to rush to support this new technology yet they maintain a stance that they are a multi-player gaming company.</p>
<p>What they should be doing is helping to develop single player encapsulated experiences supporting this vr technology as well as multi player experiences.</p>
<p>Looking down is where this technology breaks immersion if you have no body. it is a fair point that the OP made and i think if anything valve should be helping the mod team with this</p>

            <p>The future of gaming is not a pair of floating hands… Although Black Mesa Team may not implement it, and there is nothing wrong with that, the question itself is not unreasonable in the world of today though in terms of what is coming in the future.</p>

            <p>Having a Gordon Model and having him properly animated (also including holding weapons, climbing ladders etc.) would allow for shooting a movie in the game. That would of course be interesting.</p>
<p>But the game itself would not benefit from that - the game should be played, not watched.</p>
