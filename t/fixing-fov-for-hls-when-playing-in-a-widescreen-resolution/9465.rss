    <title>Fixing FOV for HLS when playing in a widescreen resolution?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixing-fov-for-hls-when-playing-in-a-widescreen-resolution/9465</link>
    <description>I was told by someone on this forum (before the threads were dropped) that the FOV in Half-Life Source gets messed up when you switch to a widescreen resolution. 

How do you fix it?</description>

            <p>Keep in mind that for widescreen your FOV should probably be set to 90 instead of 75.</p>

            <p>It might be that you’re not in game when the command is entered, but I could be wrong. I’d just bind a key to switch your FOV ("bind x “fov 75”).</p>

            <p>Ok, I tried doing that and put it in an autoexec.cfg script with an sv_autosave 1 command as well; but while the autosave definitely works now, the FOV doesn’t seem to work.</p>
<p>I say that because if I go into console and type fov 75, the view changes. Which must mean it didn’t work the first time, correct?</p>

            <p>I’ve never had any problems playing HL:S in widescreen. But if you do,</p>
<p>Console:</p>
<p><code>sv_cheats 1
fov ##</code></p>
<p>Where ## is some number.</p>
