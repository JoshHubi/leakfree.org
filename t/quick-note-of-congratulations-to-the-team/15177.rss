    <title>Quick note of congratulations to the team</title>

    <description>Hi all,

Sorry to clutter up the forums, but I just wanted to give the Black Mesa team my heartfelt congratulations.  A mod of this size is an astonishing accomplishment, and I thrilled to replay Half Life taking advantage of the full Source engine.  The sheer amount of work this must have taken is mind boggling - I forgot Half Life was so big, and you have captured its essence beautifully.  I don&#39;t really have any more to say so I&#39;ll leave it there.

Yours,

A very happy customer</description>

            <p>Ah, i remember first discovering the Black Mesa. I envy you, because for you this is a wonderful new experience,<br>
while i went past that point years ago. Played the game many times and it kinda got bland.</p>
<p>Now with the Xen finally arriving soon, i’ll get to experience that feeling again!</p>
<p>CC you rock!</p>
