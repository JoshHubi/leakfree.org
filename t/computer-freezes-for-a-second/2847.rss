    <title>Computer Freezes for a Second</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-freezes-for-a-second/2847</link>
    <description>I used to have a problem where sometimes my computer would just freeze for less than a second.
The screen freezes and the sound is replaced by a weird garbled sound.

Then it just went away, and I don&#39;t know why, but now it seems to have come back.

Sometimes it just keeps happening no matter what I do, but sometimes it goes away after a few restarts.

I have no clue what might be causing this.

Any help?


edit: problem fixed: slab of dust on heatsink caused overheating</description>

            <p>It took you 4 months to figure out that your computer is overheating due to dust bunnies blocking the airflow in the heatsinks?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Yeah, the cables are pretty crazy  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  It would be a lot of work for little gain to organize them a bit better though. It’s pretty condensed, so it has little effect outside of that area I think. I had to be creative to get it like this though, I used tape and rubber bands :3</p>
<p>I should’ve asked before, but what’s a vertical HSF? I’m guessing it has something to do with the direction the air is blown in?<br>
I think I’ll get an 80mm fan from an old computer, as that one’s only used for watching videos and such now. 80mm should suffice for now, I think (mainly to spare me the effort of going to the shop :3).</p>
<p>My pleasure, and I certainly will, you’ve been very helpful  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Edit: oh wait, I get it. The fan Assassin linked is mounted vertically.<br>
Am I right in thinking that I’d have to reapply thermal paste? Yeah, you said that before didn’t you  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Good to hear the temps dropped so much, and you are very welcome for the help.  Side note - CRAZY cable nest in that case haha.</p>
<p>Like Mango said, a vertical HSF setup would be optimum, as would a front 120mm intake fan.  Your side fan should definitely be intake; my suggestion to make it an exhaust fan was an experiment which veritably failed  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> .  If you find yourself with an extra $8US and start gaming more, grab an Antec Tri-Cool or something.</p>
<p>Anyways, cheers for getting to the bottom of it and let us know when you encounter your next issue  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>It’s not really that I can’t afford it, but at the moment it’s not worth the money for me, as I don’t really game that often anymore.</p>
<p>Haha has it been <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> long? I can’t believe I’ve lived with this problem for over four months :fffuuu: :3<br>
Yeah, seems like it’s fixed. Haven’t had any lag spikes any more, neither in CoD2 nor in CoD4.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help again, especially Mango Assassin and Batz.</p>

            <p>That fan on the CPU, the one actually ON the CPU with the heat-sinks, should be pushing air out so should be exhausting air away from the heat-sink which dissipates heat. (theoretically) but some people have results that INTAKE on CPU is slightly cooler,</p>
<p>Your best bet is to buy a nice CPU cooler you’ll be looking anywhere from 12-18+ drop in centigrade measurements.</p>
<p>This cpu cooler is new, just to give you an idea :</p>

<p>Both case fans are exhaust, CPU and GPU are intake.<br>
So you’re saying I should turn around the side case fan? It was like that originally, but I got better results for my CPU this way. Haven’t really checked out the effect on the GPU.</p>
<p>My fans are both 120mm, if I’m not mistaken. I might add another fan at the front, I think I can take one from an old computer anyway.</p>

Fronts (if available, [COLOR=‘RoyalBlue’]intakes.)</p>

<p>Can you send some pictures of the inside of your case.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]EDIT : Do you have any smaller fans, such as, an 80mm on a fixing that could fit a 120mm? if so spend some cash.</p>

            <p>Turns out there were massive clots of dust on my CPU heatsink. I dusted out my computer, and turned around both case fans, and now my temp is 40+°C at idle.</p>
<p>Case fans are now exhausting air out of the case, while the CPU and GPU fans are blowing air towards the CPU and GPU. That’s a good set up, I hope?</p>
<p>I’m going to try and find out if the problem is still there now. If it is, I’ll contact you, Jeannot, for the memory stuff.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help everyone!</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, any time you remove/install a HSF, you should replace the thermal compound.  If you get a new one, it should come with some pre-applied (not the highest quality, but to get “good stuff” is another $8US or so.  Wipe as much as you can off with a lint-free rag, then use a Q-tip soaked in rubbing alcohol to clean the rest (off both the CPU and the old HSF).</p>
<p>As for your current HSF, it doesn’t “take air in” so much as it “blows air around”.  Figure, it’s not connected to the wall of your case, so it’s not intaking or exhausting.  That’s why I like vertical HSFs, such as the one I posted - as opposed to blowing hot air down towards your CPU, or up away from it (which would create turbulence with your current side intake fan) vertical HSFs blow air towards the rear or top of your case, helping overall airflow.</p>
<p>Concerning doing things “on the cheap” you can get a 120mm fan for <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835209005" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">~$9US</a>.  It sucks having to put money out, but think of it this way - suppose the heat ends up blowing your CPU?  $30 for a HSF and $9 for a case fan seems economic compared to a blown $100 processor.</p>
<p>And you’re welcome for the help - I love discussing this stuff  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Second, if/when you replace your cooler (or even if you go to remove it) run your computer for 10-15 minutes so the thermal compound loosens up.  If you try to remove a cold HSF, you have a very good chance of busting your CPU socket.</p>

</aside>
<p>A few things in response to this post.  First, I would get yourself a can of compressed air (unless you have a compressor, then I’d say use ~35-40psi in short bursts on all the fans, especially the CPU HSF [heatsink + fan]).</p>
<p>Second, if/when you replace your cooler (or even if you go to remove it) run your computer for 10-15 minutes so the thermal compound loosens up.  If you try to remove a cold HSF, you have a very good chance of busting your CPU socket.</p>

<p>Finally, if it’s possible, and if your case has the mounts for it, I would install an intake fan on the front of your system.  Yes, I know I just said that exhausting is normally better, but ideally you want front-to-back airflow in your case.  Since you have no front intake fans as it is, adding one SHOULD help, especially if you can fit a 120mm in there.</p>
<p>As for another cooler, <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> SHOULD fit your system (quick research shows the Q6600 is LGA775, which the AC Freezer 7 is compatible with).  Otherwise, good cooling names are Coolermaster, Zalman, Xigmatek (usually pricey).</p>
<p>Hope that helps  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
