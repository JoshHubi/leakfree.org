    <title>Freezer Health Issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/freezer-health-issue/10871</link>
    <description>Not so much a direct bug as a way to make proceeding further impossible. Earlier today I found myself in the first section where you run through the freezer with it hurting you as you go. Fine enough, except that I had only 5 health when I entered the room with the scientist in front of it. Yes there is the energy charger for the suit, but because I had only 5 health I would die long before reaching the vent at the back. The scientist seals the door as well, so there is no way to go back and find more health. You need an absolute minimum of 25 health to make it through that room and survive the cold, even if you just sprint through without bothering to stop and fight things.

A possible solution would be to put a health pack in that room. I simply loaded a previous save, but it was annoying.</description>

<p>IIRC if you’re low on health and would keep pressing your “use” button on scientist he would heal you up a bit allowing to pass through the freezer without being killed.</p>

            <p>The scientist can also heal you enough, I believe, to survive the jaunt through the room.</p>

            <p>I also found it really dumb that being in the freezer drains health, when that scientist only says that “it’ll sap your suit” when saying that it would freaking kill you would be a more accurate description.</p>
