    <title>We got Black Mesa on Steam!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/we-got-black-mesa-on-steam/9384</link>
    <description>Hey everyone!

Black Mesa officially just got GREENLIT!  Thanks so much for all of your support! This has been a wild ride, and this is just as much your victory as ours!

EDIT:
For everyone asking, you guys know about as much as we do.  We WILL be releasing on Friday, in some form or another, no matter what.

There&#39;s a lot of talking and figuring out stuff ahead of us before the game actually gets on Steam. We really don&#39;t know exactly how long that will take, so we will all have to wait and see. We&#39;re doing our best, we are as excited about it as you are!</description>

            <p>@ wow:<br>
You can look on Steam tomorrow afternoon 4:47 (our time) but it’ll most likely not be there yet, and no it’s no special version of steam.</p>
<p>You’ll have to come to <a href="https://www.blackmesasource.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.blackmesasource.com</a> and when counter hits zero it’ll take you automatically to <a href="https://release.blackmesasource.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://release.blackmesasource.com</a> where the download info will be.<br>
That page is painfully white at the moment lol, zero lines of code  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Personally, Xen is way further then I ever got in the original game before other games distracted me. So I don’t really mind that it’ll be missing Xen. It’ll still be cool when it’s added, though.</p>
<p>Also, I love how the counter’s (<a href="http://blackmesasource.com" rel="nofollow noopener">blackmesasource.com</a>) picture has changed. It’s a neat effect.</p>

<p>I bet more than 50% of the people about to play the mod have not read the description and have no idea it’s incomplete. Hopefully we don’t get too many people raging on the forum about it.</p>
<p>I wonder what happens when you walk into the teleporter to Xen. Will the game just end or will there be text telling you about Xen releasing next year? I imagine there are a lot of people that are playing this that have never played the original because of the outdated graphics, so hopefully there is a message there letting the newbies know it’s not the end of the game.</p>

<p>The delay of xen can be explained by a time displacement when you enter the portal, like when you arrive at Kleiners lab a few weeks later.

<p>I have one friend who I’ve introduced to this that played HL2, but didn’t want to play the original HL because of how old it is. I guided him through the SDK installation process. I made sure to tell him that it is not the complete game without mentioning anything about Xen because even the name Xen is a spoiler of sorts. I can’t wait to hear his experience of the game.</p>

<p>The last time the devs hardcoded a year turned out really badly, so I really doubt the text would explicitly say “next year”.</p>

            <p>I bet more than 50% of the people about to play the mod have not read the description and have no idea it’s incomplete. Hopefully we don’t get too many people raging on the forum about it.</p>
<p>I wonder what happens when you walk into the teleporter to Xen. Will the game just end or will there be text telling you about Xen releasing next year? I imagine there are a lot of people that are playing this that have never played the original because of the outdated graphics, so hopefully there is a message there letting the newbies know it’s not the end of the game.</p>

<p>I’m surprised that many of the comments there don’t know why Xen is not in the first release. But what’s more perplexing is that they are willing to make up and post their own theory about it and not at all bothering to check the damned official announcement.</p>
<p>Regardless, RC7!!! Woohooo!</p>

            <p>Then we are in the mega-eye-hole of calmness.  Or, as we scientists call it, Meh.</p>
<p>Anyway, whilst meh-ing, I found myself watching the '09 trailer again, and it dawned on me (again) just how awesome some of the interior shots looked.  I can only imagine that they’ve gotten better, and that the facility is going to feel even more amazing when we get to experience it in person!</p>
