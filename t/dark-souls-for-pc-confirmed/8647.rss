Pretty much every rumor lately was leading up to this.

I already have the game for the PS3 but I&#39;m glad they&#39;re bringing this for PC finally.

Just hope the port is decent and the franchise gets PC versions from now own.</description>

            <p>Screenshots look at high res. I picked this up last night, so hopefully I’ll be able to dick around and get the mod working tonight.</p>

<p>Some guy modded the game to run natively at 1080p+ within the first hour of the release (23 minutes is the official time apparently) without access to the source code, only messing around with DX9. I think this is really funny and kind of sad at the same time.</p>

            <p>I don’t think the resolution is going to be changeable even in the files. In the article it says that the internal framebuffer is locked at that resolution. I don’t think doing anything in the files will be able to raise that, it seems like some hardlocked shit. It’d be nice if someone figured out how to after release though, I’m sure there’s going to be a lot of people looking for ways in any case.</p>

            <p>Even if we can change the res through text files…are you fucking kidding me? The last game I played that I had no way to change the resolution in game or at least through a launcher was GL Quake - which came out in 1997.</p>

<p>Game will be locked at 1024x720, the resolution setting only upscaling it it seems. It’s also locked at 30 fps. GFWL as well. This is shaping up to be the worst PC port ever.</p>

<p>Exactly. Besides, the lower texture detail on console games is more because of limited RAM than rendering resolution.</p>
<p>They need to pack a huge amount of stuff into just little less than 512 MB of RAM.</p>

<p>That’s not really what I meant. I was thinking that if the textures were made for a game that was going to be played at 720p then if you were to play with the same textures at 1080p then they wouldn’t look very good.</p>

            <p>GFWL has not been confirmed by the developers yet, so there’s a chance it might not use it. As for the resolution, it will have to have a choice of different resolutions since not all brands of monitors are compatible with 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Besides, you’d have to be doing a bad port on purpose to not include resolution options.</p>

            <p>Anybody still following this? There are so many problems that are cropping up. GFWL is one, which people are trying to get removed. Just recently it’s been revealed that it will most likely be locked at 30 fps because of how the game was made, and that either the resolution will be locked at 720p or the textures will be the same as the console versions, meaning 720p.</p>

            <p>Agreed. The way the controls are now on the PS3, a direct port would never work. I hope they take the time to build an interface that works well with M/KB and don’t just say expect PC gamers to use a gamepad.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I just want to see framerate issues fixed from the PS3 version and I’ll be happy.</p>

            <p>I hope they get the PC controlling right. I know that the game is fucking hard and bad controlling would be very frustrating.</p>

<p>Pretty much every rumor lately was leading up to this.</p>
<p>I already have the game for the PS3 but I’m glad they’re bringing this for PC finally.</p>
<p>Just hope the port is decent and the franchise gets PC versions from now own.</p>
