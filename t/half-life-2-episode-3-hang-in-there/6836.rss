    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-2-episode-3-hang-in-there/6836</link>
    <description>Looking at the March Madness thread where the game developers battle it out i come across a nice little document that many people will find interesting, not sure if it has already been noted or posted but hey, its episode 3  :smiley: 

[url]https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/108821-Valve-Says-Hang-In-There-For-Half-Life-2-Episode-3[/url]

Will Half life 2: Episode 3 come before BlackMesa Source? Only time will tell.

<p>Yeah, tons of stupid crap, thats why they’re one of the most successful companies on the planet. so flush with cash in fact that they  can do what they want whenever they want with no ipo and have you dry humping any interview hoping to get a little info on the next installment of their flagship series.

<p>Depends on the game.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Anyway, my point was, people pay for whatever floats their boat. Pretending to shoot people and pretending to wear hats are both pointless time wasters, but some people pay to do them, because hey, some people think they’re fun. If you think hats are stupid and worth less than any game, that’s fine. Can’t stop me from thinking some games are stupid and worth less than a TF2 hat.</p>
<p>Oh and just for the record, I’m only playing the devil’s advocate. I could not imagine paying for a hat in TF2, the only ones I have I found or crafted.</p>

            <p>i dunno… i actually have no problem what soever with Valve taking a long time for EP.3 its actually extremely reassuring that they are.  It seems to be the trend for developers to put out the next title in a franchise a little too quickly which i think wastes so much potential that could be put into the next game.</p>
<p>think of it this way:  Valve’s big title is Half Life and they know one very important fact… if they rush it and its sub par… they will have a LOT of angry fans. So other games are developed centering around different ideas</p>
<p>Portal - I’m sure Valve has learned a lot with story telling and seamlessly incorporating learning what to do, with the game itself. On top of this they have tested out using the players eye movements, where they are looking as means of where the game is looking.</p>
<p>L4D - The AI director in these games make replaying the same map for the 60th time just as intense and exciting as the 1st. plus with new research and a working version of the game that does monitor the players actual stress levels, they can hone in and tailor the game as the person is playing it.</p>
<p>i’m sure there is tons of more research going on in valve that seems way ahead of the curve of where developers are making their games today… all of this, the information that theyve gotten from the feedback and research, all can be incorporated into making EP3 that much more amazing. instead of simply having a game that does nothing new, even if it is still fun, Valve may have the potential to make EP3 a game that is unparalleled for years to come after its release.</p>
<p>Maybe i’m putting too much trust and hope into it but like i said valve knows if they release anything that is below the highest expectations, they will have a lot of unhappy fans. My opinion, Valve has earned the right to take as long as they want. they produce quality, not rushed money cash-ins</p>

            <p>That would have no effect on the core team for Dota 2, so I’m not sure what you’re getting at. Say it is as “big” of a team as Portal 2 – which seems unlikely. That’s 30 people.</p>

<p>Not how… I meant why… I don’t think the core of valve fans even care about playing this game more so than say ep3… It feels even more pointlesd and unwelcome as l4d2.</p>

<p>Gabe Newell’s a really big fan of the mod. I get the impression that getting Ice Frog was kind of his little coup, but I don’t know that for sure. It doesn’t really look like a major project for them though. It probably just has a tiny core team like Portal 1 and Alien Swarm.</p>
<p>Your assumption that Ep. 3 is delayed because they’re focusing on other games is probably false. There are 250 people at Valve. There are 30 working on Portal 2 and probably far less than that on Dota. Do the math.</p>

<p>More like hang in there because they felt like writing something about valve today.</p>
<p>I’ve read it and it specifically says we still don’t know if episode 3 is coming or not, or why after that massive cliffhanger has valve chosen to work on Portal 2, Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, Dota 2, etc instead of working on their most successful series.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They don’t want to rely only on one successful mark, if you know what I mean. When people think back to Valve in future, they will think: “Oh, you mean Valve? The developers of Team Fortress, L4D, Half Life, Portal?” and not just “Oh, Valve? The creators of Half Life?”</p>

            <p>Actually if you followed the link it came from, you’d know that there was a full interview with Doug Lombardi. A very corporate history-ish interview that’s full of a bunch of pretty common questions, none of them quite news-worthy as I’m sure we’ve heard all of these answers in previous interviews.</p>
