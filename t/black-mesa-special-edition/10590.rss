    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-special-edition/10590</link>
    <description>I have not even finished the game yet.... But I am totally loving what the DEV Team have done.

So Basically Instead of only releasing The Xen or Part 2... Do you think that it should be a slightly overhauled version tweaked a bit balance wise But also to include the following.

Re-insertion of the Uplink Chapter after you launch the rocket...But Re-imagined 

Re-insertion of any missing scripted sequences if possible or moved to another part of a level or slightly expanded to accomodate some small things that got left out

The Hazzard Course as a standalone time trial with online leaderboards...DEVS OWN VERSION NOT FOR TRAINING PURPOSES basically a speed run but with achievements and online top scorers and rank the real thing... Launched outside of campaign

And ofcourse Xen

Basically I am fine with everything they have done I just want more of it!!!!  :slight_smile: 

And it gives people another reason to playthrough it again as slightly tweaked and expanded in places</description>

<p>We keep repeating this on these forums.  I hope some day people will learn:  the developers have stated many times, they will not work on Hazard Course, Uplink, Blue Shift, Opposing Force or Decay.  You’re asking for cut content to be included again.  Have you considered that it might’ve been cut for a good reason?  I, for one, find Uplink insanely boring.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is not our game; it’s their game.  And the developers have made their choice.  It’s time for you to accept that and either drop it, or make your own levels.  By the way, if you do make your own levels for Black Mesa, be sure to post them here in the “Test Chamber” section of the forum. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Just small tweaks really and sometimes different enemy placement because houdeyes could be placed wrong in some parts if they are not on the same level plane as Gordon they are useless dead meat.</p>
<p>I am not boasting but I had this complex about them disregarding uplink and I have mapped over half of it and spoke to raminator about it now I am going to post my unfiinshed work from a couple of years ago onto him as a thanks it just needs to happen</p>
<p>it is not like I expect them to do it just by asking them… And my map is crap by their standards but not crap for a single guy wanting it to happen. and alot of hard work with some scripting too</p>
<p>But I was on their level of thought atleast so this for me is the way forward now…</p>
<p>Wish I had of handed it over 2 years ago… I will pakrat it as soon as I can and send to them</p>
<p>Now I believe… This MOD is the nuts</p>

            <p>Good idea. I’d love it if the devs took onboard the most popular feedback almost like it was a pubic beta. Things like vort chargeup time, tweaks to the HECU, more Xen aliens to make it more obvious the HECU are having trouble. Etc.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">“A reminder that the Black Mesa Hazard Course decathlon will commence this evening at 1900 hours in the Level Three facility. The semi-finals for high security personnel will be announced in a separate secure access transmission. Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your fitness.”</span></p>
<p>I actually think this is a really cool idea. While I don’t expect the dev team to do this, perhaps the team working on Hazard Course could.</p>

            <p>They did such a great job of this so what If I have not finished it I will be soon so I think they should do it this way…</p>
<p>Hazzard course but the real competition not a training mode</p>
<p>Basically I want them to do it because I think it is very good what they have done that is all</p>
<p>Uplink would be amazing if they could do this</p>

            <p>The Hazard Course is being worked on by a community project. The Devs have no intention of doing it.</p>

<p>Hehe, how about finishing the game first, before asking for more?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bug fixes are likely to come.</li>
<li>Xen will come.</li>
<li>Deathmach will come.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else could you want?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hazard Course won’t come, because these days tutorial maps not needed, Unforseen Consequences has all the lessons one could need.</li>
<li>Uplink is being redone by others.</li>
</ul>
