    <title>[Extremely important addon to the game] Proper Game Icon</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/extremely-important-addon-to-the-game-proper-game-icon/14402</link>
    <description>I  think it&#39;s a bit silly that in 2015, the black mesa mod uses the hl2 logo when alt-tabbed, a simple fix for this is just to take this icon:
[url]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7315285/Maps/BlackMesa/game.ico[/url]
Remake it if needed.

Drop it in the resource folder of the bms_misc_dir.vpk file.
So.. I need a dev to do that.
K thx bai!  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>Agreed! Ever since viewing this thread, my experience playing Black Mesa has been utterly ruined by this glaringly <span class="bbcode-i">obvious</span> and bothersome error.</p>
<p>While one might argue that listing something so minuscule that it would take a concentrated effort to notice and then prioritizing it over other glaring issues, <span class="bbcode-i">as well as</span> attracting attention to said thread with the title “Extremely Important”  is a mischievous  act, that should warrant no further attention besides a simple “we’ll get to it eventually”… I disagree.  But who am I to speak on others behalf? I have constructed <a href="https://strawpoll.me/5452470" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this poll</a> as a simple way for users to express what they feel is the most refractory issue they wish to be incorporated into the next update, please, share your opinions!  Regardless, I believe should similar issues arise, they should be directed and addressed as “simple suggestions”.</p>

            <p>We’ll get to this, eventually.</p>
<p>It’s one of those things where, a long time ago, someone on the team (which may or may not have been me) one day said…“Hey, why is the Steam icon ugly?” “Hey, why do we still have the HL2 icon for our .exe? Shouldn’t we fix that?”</p>
<p>And then…nothing happened. Nobody knows why or how. It’s one of those weirdly specific things to fix due to the way our content is structured internally, we have to talk to our release guy to fix it, I think.</p>

</aside>
<p>I can’t remember, was the retail version ported to a newer version of Source? That might explain it. Perhaps a lot of the game was reconstructed from scratch, or slowly ported over, and they simply forgot the icon.</p>

            <p>I agree. The game needs a better icon. The current one looks worse than the one from the mod version (2012). Here’s the icon from the mod version: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XfJFv.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/XfJFv.png</a> Add it back, devs  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And I know this isn’t top priority. Just a suggestion for your “to-do” list. No need to rush with it.</p>

It’s just that placing the game.ico i in the resource folder isn’t very well documented on zeh interwebs and thats why most people don’t know about it.</p>
<p>“Worth the time.”</p>
<p>It takes them about 1-2 minutes to do it and makes the game look less like a hl2 mod and more of a proper game. It’s the little things.</p>

<p>Perhaps, but it does show a mild lack of polish in my opinion. It’s not a big deal though, not worth putting it up as a suggestion.<br>
Maybe a bug thread or something would be more akin to a lack of an icon, but again, it’s not exactly important.<br>
Personally, I just cannibalized the icon from the free version that I still have installed for some reason.</p>
