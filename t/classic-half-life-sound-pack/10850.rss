    <title>Classic Half-Life sound pack</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/classic-half-life-sound-pack/10850</link>
    <description>Black Mesa is great. Quite a few times throughout the game I felt like I was playing the original Half-Life, but renovated. Shooting is enjoyable, music is OK, level design is amazing - it is very much close to Half-Life.
The only problem for me were the sound effects. The developers made a huge effort to mimic the classic sounds and they did okay, but it&#39;s just not the originals we all love. Because of that I decided to create a little modification consisting my favorite sound effects from the original Half-Life. These include:

[b]Weapons:[/SIZE][/b]
 
* Tau Cannon
* Gluon Gun
* Snark hunt and deploy sounds

[b]UI:[/SIZE][/b] 
 
* Ammo pickup
* Weapon pickup
* Flashlight on/off (Half-Life 2)
* Health charger
* Suit charger
* Medkit pickup

[b]NPC:[/SIZE][/b] 

* Houndeye charging and hurting sounds



Notes:
1.) If you think HL&#39;s Tau Cannon overcharge sounds are lame, you can always replace them with the BM&#39;s (included in the pack)
2.) I didn&#39;t replace the battery pickup sound because it&#39;s a bleak Counter-Strike weapon pickup sound. But in case you are an ultra-purist I included it in the pack

            <p>@ The copyright thing.</p>
<p>Probaly copyright and the fact that they wanted to create them from scratch to use it as a portfolio for getting a job in the game-making industry.</p>
<p>By the way Xalener, you need to make the vort’s skin dark brown. Dark brown as shit.</p>

<p>The original vorts were way better for their time… New ones from hl2 remind me of jaja binks or some trying to be half cute alien… I HATE that cutesy crap they sometimes put in modern games. ie borderlands robot thingy. Id rather talk to paperclip friend in word…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">   nice to see youve been inspired by the release of BMS. Cant wait for a complete sound pack that tickles my fancy enough and replaces enough of the sounds for me to be fully nostalged. The vorts could probably be totally remodled to have a scarier face in my opinion.</p>
<p>Hoping for some kind of change to the soldiers aswell even though it might just ruin the gameplay. Some small changes maybe to make em a little more like the original but not so predictable like the original.</p>
<p>Hope someone reads this and gets inspred to MOD the mod some more. hehehe</p>
<p>It really has made a diff in my life gettin this mod. Been having a few cool half life related dreams at night  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">   HALF - LIFE FOREVER!  … lol this mod kicks duke forevers arse doesnt it.</p>
<p>Poo gearbox, what happened they did such a good job of opposing force</p>
<p>Im gonna give it some time and see if a really good sound pack or perhaps ( nostalgia) pack  comes out. If not im gonna do my best to replace the sounds i want back. Might be hard though i think the devs did real good job of making the sounds bring back the HL1 feel but still feel refreshed in the new engine, If you catch my drift.</p>
<p>Anyway in the mean time i think everybodys heading for the surface. So im gonna try and open up the reactor complex so we can get down to safety. And i hope the radiation levels arnt to high sent smithers down there and he never came back… whats that   NO STAY BACK… GOOORDON !!!  RAAAAHHHH!!!   … splat    hehehe</p>

            <p>Added those freckles (they were supposed to be pits, but the texture was so low rez in HL1 it always registered to me as splotches of darker pigment) and some of the hexagonal turtle shell shit to the belly that the original had. I changed the diffuse of the shackles back to the original HL2 ones because the iridescence map kinda took care of the green tint it needed anyway. I could whip up something higher rez though, definitely. Also, simplified the pupil detail greatly to match the flat red that was in HL1. That affected the bullsquid too, but meh. I think it looks cooler on the BS anyway. Though I do wish it had that white eye it did in the original. Maybe I can do something about that, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>I also added a separate lightrap texture for the vorts and the Agrunts for more exaggerated translucency. I’m testing out something else for the bullsquids and houndeyes since an orange endodermis layer doesn’t make much sense for them.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t want to derail this thread. I’ll start my own when I get home. I was weary about it because the rules said “NO SOUNDS”. It really sucks, because that’s my specialty.</p>

<p>I agree about the Vorts, but I guess they kept the same sounds from HL2 and the episodes for consistency. I do prefer the harsh cackling of the Vorts from HL1 though, they just feel more ‘alien’.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa is great. Quite a few times throughout the game I felt like I was playing the original Half-Life, but renovated. Shooting is enjoyable, music is OK, level design is amazing - it is very much close to Half-Life.<br>
The only problem for me were the sound effects. The developers made a huge effort to mimic the classic sounds and they did okay, but it’s just not the originals we all love. Because of that I decided to create a little modification consisting my favorite sound effects from the original Half-Life. These include:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Weapons:[/SIZE]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Tau Cannon</li>
<li>Gluon Gun</li>
<li>Snark hunt and deploy sounds</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">UI:[/SIZE]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ammo pickup</li>
<li>Weapon pickup</li>
<li>Flashlight on/off (Half-Life 2)</li>
<li>Health charger</li>
<li>Suit charger</li>
<li>Medkit pickup</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">NPC:[/SIZE]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Houndeye charging and hurting sounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:<br>
1.) If you think HL’s Tau Cannon overcharge sounds are lame, you can always replace them with the BM’s (included in the pack)<br>
2.) I didn’t replace the battery pickup sound because it’s a bleak Counter-Strike weapon pickup sound. But in case you are an ultra-purist I included it in the pack</p>
<p>Here’s a video preview<br>
