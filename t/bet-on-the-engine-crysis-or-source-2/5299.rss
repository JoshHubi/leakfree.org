<p>Yea, of course there is, instead of updating whats already there… Microsoft knows that they could make more cash by putting out a new product… if they did update it like Valve updates source, maybe we would still be using win 98.</p>

            <p>The Source engine is supposed to be like that but as hardware gets more and more powerful and new features are created, Valve eventually needs to start a fresh new engine to support all the new features properly.</p>

            <p>I have no idea how Source is structured, but it is entirely possible to code an engine to be modular, and load different versions of, say, the lighting system, depending on what game you’re playing.</p>
<p>I don’t know how difficult it would be, but that’s basically what I did with most of the shit that I made in my first programming class.</p>

<p>You must be retarded to think that Valve will make a new engine when the last works perfectly well just because it’s now Half-Life 3 instead of 2.</p>
<p>Unless Source starts falling really far behind the competition and can no longer be updated to graphical standards, Valve WILL NOT make a source engine 2, regardless of whether or not it’s Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 6: Modern Science 2.</p>

<p>I never associated the loading screens in HL with overcoming challenges. They’re short enough that they only serve the purpose of loading the next .bsp. What truly indicates me that I’m making progress is when the name of the chapters show up. As far as I’m concerned having no loading screens in the middle of the would only enhance the experience.</p>

<p>I don’t mean making one huge map. I mean finding a way to load the maps in the background without having to interrupt the game with loading screens.</p>
<p>Uncharted, for example, apart from the initial loading, doesn’t have any mid-level loading for the whole game. You can basically play the whole game from start to finish without loading screens between chapters.</p>
<p>It would be great if we could play Episode 3 or Half-Life 3 without loadings between chapters.</p>

            <p>The oldest game that I can think of that definitely streams the level off of whatever (disc in this case) is the first Medal of Honor.  The levels were pretty big, and the PS1 had like, no RAM.  If you use the wireframe cheat, or just open the disc cover while playing, you can see where the seams in the levels are.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Valve would do something like that, or go a step further and do what Gears of War or (apparently) Uncharted 2 did and just not stop to load after the initial load.  The question is, how much work would you have to put into it to get it to work on an existing engine?  Would it just be easier to throw whatever functions are needed for levels out and start from scratch?  I personally don’t mind a loading screen every once in a while.</p>

<p>I don’t mean making one huge map. I mean finding a way to load the maps in the background without having to interrupt the game with loading screens.</p>
<p>Uncharted, for example, apart from the initial loading, doesn’t have any mid-level loading for the whole game. You can basically play the whole game from start to finish without loading screens between chapters.</p>
<p>It would be great if we could play Episode 3 or Half-Life 3 without loadings between chapters.</p>
<p>edit: ah fuck, sorry about double post.</p>

<p>But that’s the thing. We can’t talk about an engine that doesn’t exist or has been announced yet, let alone compare it to an already existing one.</p>
<p>All we can do is speculate and we’ve already done plenty of it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope Valve’s next engine or major update removes the loadings between chapters. Even if they make the initial loading longer, I’d rather have no more loadings after that.</p>

            <p>There’s plenty of Portal 2 screenshots around, if you want to know what the next update to Source is going to look like. It’s still well behind Valve’s competition. Although I’ve always said it’s the art direction that matters and not the engine tech, look at how boring 99% of Crysis is.</p>

</aside>
<p>It annoys me to read comments on other sites where people write that the Source Engine is old, although it gets updated for every new game by Valve. But the people (especially 11 year old kids who already got a pc) don’t realize it. Many think that Valve uses a new engine because of the Portal 2-Videos.</p>
<p>What I mean is, the people only think it’s a good engine, if it gets a new number at the end of the name, every time, a new game comes out.</p>
<p>So the people will still bet on Cry-Engine, cause it still looks better and has a higher number than the Source Engine. The fact, that the Source Engine needs lower hardware than the CE doesn’t affect it that much. And a new Source Engine 2 might comes out when the new console-generation is coming. Maybe 2012</p>

<p>To be honest I love the Source engine. It is perfectly balanced and won’t kill your computer or turn it into a microwave. It will run at 60 FPS maxed out on average modern-day computers. Plus the water effects are very nice. The textures are a bit pixelated though, but not very much. I never liked Crysis’s engine very much. It looked a little nice but it seemed to be all about Crytek’s e-penis, so I’m not too excited about running Crysis 2.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>lol its supposed to run better than warhead.<br>
the crytek engine is actually pretty scalable (not as much as source of course)</p>
