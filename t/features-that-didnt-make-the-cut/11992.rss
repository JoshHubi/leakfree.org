    <title>Features that didn&#39;t make the cut</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/features-that-didnt-make-the-cut/11992</link>
    <description>Well, hopefully this is the right section. Was there anything previewed/showcased/mentioned before release that isn&#39;t present in the game or has been changed since first sight? I&#39;m not talking about minor things, but something important. Things like level design and such logically change during the development process, so that&#39;s obvious, but in gaming, some planned features have to be cut for any reason sometimes, any example with BM?</description>

<p>Even though that’s not a deal breaker, more variants (actual new models instead of re-textures) would greatly improve the immersion. The models from the trailer were (if I remember a dev’s statement correctly) cut before the face-generator came into play. It would be nice if they weren’t lost and could return later or something.</p>

<p>Quite possibly, but it’s not like the devs are answering questions these days, and that one isn’t for discussion between posters, but a “poster asks, a dev answers” thread, so I do think at least. And yes, right; co-op.</p>

            <p>Well, hopefully this is the right section. Was there anything previewed/showcased/mentioned before release that isn’t present in the game or has been changed since first sight? I’m not talking about minor things, but something important. Things like level design and such logically change during the development process, so that’s obvious, but in gaming, some planned features have to be cut for any reason sometimes, any example with BM?</p>
