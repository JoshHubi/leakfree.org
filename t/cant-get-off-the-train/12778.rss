    <title>can&#39;t get off the train</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-get-off-the-train/12778</link>
    <description>Hey i installed Black Mesa and it&#39;s running and all, but i can&#39;t get past the introduction. When the train arrives at Sector C, there should be a security to let me of the train but he won&#39;t show up. It doesn&#39;t freeze or crash, so no minidump, crashlog whatsoever. I already checked that the files I downloaded from gamefront aren&#39;t broken and did a reinstallation.
If no-one has a solution I&#39;d gladly take a savegame from just after this scene.</description>

            <p>This reminds me the bug I had with the original HL… When the guard came to open the door, he was killed by the electrified rail… Epic LoL</p>

<p>Skipped the scene using map bms_c1a0b in the console, just missed putting on my HEV Suit and proceeded from there. Hope I don’t have to skip more memorable moments.</p>

<p>If you notice some more skipped scenes, you’ll need to go with TehBoxNoob’s suggestion.</p>
