    <title>Gordon.... A girl?!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gordon-a-girl/4212</link>
    <description>I introduced half-life to some bored girls and they became addicted to half-life. One of em got a crush on Gordon Freeman! :freeman::meh:

So... She came to me and asked... &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be better if Gordon is a girl?&quot;... I was like :what::zip: and speechless.

She slapped me coz I I gazed at her chest, which I honestly didn&#39;t noticed, and started to search the net for &quot;female Gordon Freeman&quot; models. She only found models of Gina Cross. She then started imagining what would happen if Gordon is a girl. 

-would Alyx have been a boy?
-would barney have been a girl?
-would G-man have been a girl? 
-would &quot;girl&quot; Gordon Freeman still be hardcore?
 :fffuuu::fffuuu::fffuuu::fffuuu::fffuuu:

I don&#39;t now why she started changing the genders of the characters. I don&#39;t know what runs trough a girls mind. She then started to write a story of her own with a girl Gordon Freeman...:jizz:

So... what do you &quot;guys&quot; think? I think the idea is funny but horrible.

Even a bigger question... If the creators of Half-life were all girls... what would have happened... Ram...:retard:</description>

<p>okay, a couple things don’t quite fit here:</p>
<p>Possible. I’m certainly not about to think that girls can’t like video games, and while I do know that there are spatial reasoning issues that usually make FPS  lot more disorienting for girls, that’s still only a rule of thumb. Still, this is pretty unusual addiction unless these girls were already into gaming, and already had experience with 3d titles(anything not using a fixed camera)This is the section that really gives me pause. I can see a girl getting a crush on Gordon Freeman, but then if she’s crushing on him, why want to make him a woman, unless she’s got some minor lesbian leanings? Well, there’s also another possibility; this whole story is actually not real, and it’s really a GUY who has the crush on Gordon Freeman, and therefor wants him to be a woman.</p>
<p>– Actually… It’s Half-life is the very first FPS game that she ever played. She’s a girl… A REAL GIRL. She died a lot of times even on easy.</p>
<p>Another part of the story that doesn’t ring true, while Google Image doesn’t return anything relevant, just doing a regular google search on “female gordon freeman” has the first result as a proper hit, turning up a thread that links to <a href="https://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w315/felipefrango/concept.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">THIS IMAGE.</a> It’s not much, but it’s still close to a year old, so even if this story wasn’t recent, it should still have been findable.<br>
Also, as you had said earlier, she was introduced to it along with some other bored girls, so why didn’t she discuss this with them instead of you?</p>
<p>– I didn’t know what and how she searched a MODEL “female Gordon freeman”. She wanted to replace the the character you’re using. As in in-game that if you went in third-person you’ll see the MODEL. I didn’t discussed it to all of them coz not all of em are “Friends”.</p>
<p>All of this starts to sound a bit like testing the waters on feelings that you’re a little uncomfortable with. Like “hey this guy i know, NOT ME, is really in to just totally crazy stuff like 2 girls 1 cup. He, NOT ME, totally gets off on it, isn’t that just sick and crazy?” If everyone agrees that it’s sick and crazy then you can continue to pretend it’s not you who thinks that way, but if they go “It’s not that crazy” then you can start being more open about your interests.</p>
<p>– huh?:retard:</p>
<p>Now it’s getting taken a step beyond ridiculous, perhaps to make the earlier idea of Gender Swapped Gordon Freeman seem a bit more acceptable in comparison.</p>
<p>– It’s her idea… not mine…</p>
<p>Of course,it is possible that the girl in question really managed to get immersed in the game, only to have that immersion broken by being called Gordon every so often, so therefor she wanted the role to be female in order to get full immersion.</p>
<p>– I guess so.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I only have this to say; Sure, it’s weird, but not THAT weird.(certainly not compared to some of the stuff you can find on the internet) You don’t really have to hide it. Having a guy crush isn’t bad either, those feelings don’t automatically mean you want to have sex with him, but merely that you see him as an ideal standard for being a man, in this case; Intelligent, Well groomed, Quiet, Not overly muscled yet not a weakling, Doesn’t buckle under pressure, and Willing to kick some ass when the situation calls for it.<br>
The proper course for pursuing those feelings is to emulate those aspects of him you see in yourself. Focus on your studies and academics, in your spare time go running/biking/swimming or other cardio focused activities and concentrate on exercises that use a low weights with increasing numbers of reps for endurance, and think carefully about what you want to say before speaking, even if it sometimes means not saying anything.</p>

<p>– There is no Guy Crush here. I just shared a story. If you won’t beleive it… then don’t.:jizz:</p>

<p>Of course,it is possible that the girl in question really managed to get immersed in the game, only to have that immersion broken by being called Gordon every so often, so therefor she wanted the role to be female in order to get full immersion.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I only have this to say; Sure, it’s weird, but not THAT weird.(certainly not compared to some of the stuff you can find on the internet) You don’t really have to hide it. Having a guy crush isn’t bad either, those feelings don’t automatically mean you want to have sex with him, but merely that you see him as an ideal standard for being a man, in this case; Intelligent, Well groomed, Quiet, Not overly muscled yet not a weakling, Doesn’t buckle under pressure, and Willing to kick some ass when the situation calls for it.<br>
The proper course for pursuing those feelings is to emulate those aspects of him you see in yourself. Focus on your studies and academics, in your spare time go running/biking/swimming or other cardio focused activities and concentrate on exercises that use a low weights with increasing numbers of reps for endurance, and think carefully about what you want to say before speaking, even if it sometimes means not saying anything.</p>
