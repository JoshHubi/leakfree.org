    <title>[Imba] An single apache need 16(!) rockets to kill?!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/imba-an-single-apache-need-16-rockets-to-kill/9668</link>
    <description>Guys... this mod is *REALLY* awesome, thanks for it. Even, if they are some crash an minor bugs. 

BUT. Why the hell need an single apache 16(!) missiles to kill?! This is a bit nonsense. (And i&#39;m not mentioning the hl2&#39;s nonsense rocket respawning box...) 

I&#39;m in the big wall in Surface Tension where I get missile launcher. My difficulty settings is normal. 

Is it designed or just some imbanalcing/bug/something else?</description>

            <p>I’m only playing on normal and I gotta say, there is definitely something wrong with the balance in this game. The A.I. just sit and wait for you to poke your head out then start filling you with lead. Normal honestly feels like hard. As for the chopper battle on the cliff face, I think it should be moving around more, and shooting a bit less. At least if they keep it’s health at or around the same level.</p>

            <p>To be honest I think this is the true beta testing.</p>
<p>Totally agree with you the helicopter is far to hard, especially since it’s on EASY by default.<br>
Also a few maps (which require a strategic retreat) need to be optimized so you don’t get 10 fps when running.</p>

            <p>lots of monster/weapon imbalances in this game.</p>
<p>grunts, bullsquids both take WAY too many combat rifle rounds to kill, headshots with anything but the pistol are far too difficult, the combat rifle only has a 30 (not 50) round magazine and doesn’t have enough accuracy, and the .357 zoom mode is really bad.</p>
<p>The game is great, but I really see a poor degree of testing. Hopefully they can patch this.</p>
