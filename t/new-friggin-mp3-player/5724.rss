    <title>New Friggin&#39; MP3 Player</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-friggin-mp3-player/5724</link>
    <description>My Creative&#39;s starting to die on me, as is wont to happen, and I want to get a new pocket music sound box before it kicks the bucket. I was going to go back to Sony, but for some bizarre reason the biggest amount of memory is 16GB, which is pathetic.

What is yous guy&#39;s opinions?

Oh, also, I don&#39;t want an iPod, because they&#39;re shitty.</description>

<p>The Cowon S9 you linked doesn’t have “amazing video quality” as you put. Maybe the sound is better (although the iTouch 4 has an improved sound card or whatever you’d like to call it), but the screen is 480x272, REALLY low resolution for the price. But if you’re going to be listening only to music I guess thats fine, although then i don’t see why youd go for it anyway considering its supposed to do more than just music.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I never said it had amazing video quality. :brow: It says in every single review that it does though. I think they mean picture quality rather than size.</p>
<p>I had a look at Creative’s X-Fi 2, but it’s apparently awful and touchscreen only (but has a shitty resistive screen to boot). I had a look at Sony’s range, but like I said they have terrible storage for the prices asked. I thought about getting the Nationite S:Flo2, but it’s hard to get hold of, expensive and is again only touchscreen. The iTouch is expensive, doesn’t have great sound quality and I don’t want to use iTunes. I could go for a Sandisk Clip+, but I’d have expand the memory which would bump the price up and even then it’s an old and ugly thing.</p>
<p>I’m going for the Cowon because it’s apparently one of the best in terms of sound quality, has decent storage, has buttons along the top (which will be so damn useful if I have it playing on random) and is <span class="bbcode-i">fucking sexy</span>. I’m not an Audiophile, but a lot of people who are seem to be saying that it’s just the best of the bunch.</p>

            <p>Anyone going to note how the iPod Touch/iPhone is hardly an MP3 player any more? It’s a Portable Media Player. Sure, it’s locked down to hell, and you’ll need to convert your videos to run on it, but if you consider the 960x640 resolution… you can get pretty sweet looking videos on that thing (720p re-encodes anyone?).</p>
<p>If you want an MP3 player, forget the iPod Touch. That’s a PMP. Yet, if you want something with an extra spice… I’d go for it! I always like the iPod Classic, but wish they’d update it. I loved the click wheel, and the only reason I got the (first-gen) iPod Touch was because it was cheap due to the crappy economy in USA (and I was travelling there from Europe… and dropped my iPod Classic in the pool Q_Q). I liked it, and eventually started using it dangerously much with the WiFi connectivity.</p>
<p>Now that I am in Japan, I bought the iPhone 4 to stay connected. The apartment I will move into won’t have a net connection, so I’ll have to live off being tethered via the phone (unlimited data plans… yes plz!).</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the MP3. I must admit that I have found the Creative line-up to be great in the past, but they tend to break on me all the time :\ I’d say for all-round lovely-ness… iPod Touch or iPod Classic. MP3-only, I’d go for the classic. Lovely for storage, too, and the click-wheel is lovely to use in the pocket. Want photos+videos+WiFi? Get the iPod Touch (4).</p>

<p>You can buy portable amps and stuff though if it’s really that big of a deal: the quality’s meant to be amazing anyway, and I would expect most other players to have similar limitations.</p>

            <p>The only feature I really use on my current Zune is the radio tuner, so the 4GB capacity isn’t a problem.</p>
<p>But that Cowon player looks gorgeous… a real contender against the iPod imo.</p>

            <p>I’m gonna pull this out of my ass and say the iPod Touch is actually pretty sweet. I’m actually saving up for one at the moment, my current MP3 Player is 2gigs and has a very basic interface and can’t play songs downloaded off iTunes (It sucks, but relatives keep giving me iTunes gift cards). I only say the iTouch is pretty sweet because I’ve seen it do more than the Pieces of shit mp3 players I’ve owned could ever do.</p>

            <p>I have played with many an iPod, and they are very shitty, both in terms of build and sound quality. I can’t speak for the Touch, but I’m not shelling out that much money for a gimmicky brick if I’m just looking for decent space and good sound.</p>

            <p>I’m definitely not the kind of guy to defend apple products, but the iPod line is for the most part full of good mp3 players, why do you say they are shitty?</p>

            <p>My Creative’s starting to die on me, as is wont to happen, and I want to get a new pocket music sound box before it kicks the bucket. I was going to go back to Sony, but for some bizarre reason the biggest amount of memory is 16GB, which is pathetic.</p>
<p>What is yous guy’s opinions?</p>
<p>Oh, also, I don’t want an iPod, because they’re shitty.</p>
