    <title>AVG detected bms.exe as a threat</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/avg-detected-bms-exe-as-a-threat/14164</link>
    <description>I was playing BM, saved my game and quit.
When i saw my desktop, AVG opened a window saying:
[attach=4000,none,503][/attach]

I clicked on more info, it opened a website saying more about the threat.
Type Unknown it said.I added the executable as an exception in the AVG.

It is probably nothing, but i guess it&#39;s for the best you
guys have this in case of future problems like these.
