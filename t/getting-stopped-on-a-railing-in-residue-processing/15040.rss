    <title>Getting stopped on a railing in Residue Processing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/getting-stopped-on-a-railing-in-residue-processing/15040</link>
    <description>In this map, if you lean against the left railing (that is, pressing A and W at the same time), the player get stuck in that position and does not move forward. Of course you can move around that railing to continue forward, but it really makes the map feel clunky. Here is the info:

[code]map bm_c2a4b
setpos -1311.968750 204.257141 576.031250;setang 9.661890 -70.717613 0.000000[/code]

I also have a video on this bug:

Thanks, I hope this gets fixed.</description>
