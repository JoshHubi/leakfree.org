    <title>Piece of Shit Wireless Card</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/piece-of-shit-wireless-card/4994</link>
    <description>Okay, so I have a cheap tew-643pi wireless card and I have had nothing but trouble with it. It&#39;s biggest problem is online gaming. It sometimes worked perfectly and other time not at all. I recently switched from my old internet, at&amp;t broadband, to comcast (which is well over twice as fast) and now it works okay for regular web browsing but it can&#39;t play online games at all. Modern Warfare 2 is completely unplayable. Other games like L4D2 are playable, but go between 100 to 1000 ping. What could be wrong???? Also, the drivers are up to date.

I also switched routers to a DIR-655 d-link router if it could be the problem.

I had problems with my last wireless card as well; it caused my computer to stutter. I gave it to a friend and it&#39;s been working fine on his computer but I don&#39;t see how it could be a problem with my comp as I tried switching the pci slots and make sure it was mounted correctly and everything.</description>

<p>Yes, because it will put fewer tasks in the hands of the DIR-655, which is prone to mental difficulties, and more into the hands of the WRT54G, which is more stable and reliable.</p>

<p>Yay!<br>
This will be very convenient as I will no longer have to string a long ethernet cord to connect xboxs to internet in my room.</p>
<p>Do you know if the router Firetime linked will have the range and speed to game at the same distance the wireless card is usually at (it reports full bars, but drops to 2 when I run utorrent)?</p>

<p>I now have an intense dislike for wireless cards.<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>I didn’t understand Firetime’s solution completely so he explained it to me and now it seems like the best option so I guess I"ll go for it, but if the DIR-655 is truly the problem, will his setup fix it?</p>

<p>Well, the big problem is I’m only 15 and thus live with my parents, so my parents bought the IDR-655, and seeing as they don’t give a shit about gaming and in fact discourage it, they are happy with the DIR-655 and like the fact that it’s fucking up my gaming. Also, my dad keeps the modem+router next to his computer, which is literally the furthest point in the house from my room.

<p>Do what i would do.<br>
wire the  Ethernet cable to your dads room through the walls and attic (doesn’t have to be an attic, but it makes things easier.<br>
Sounds hard, but with a drill, and a good hand, its really quite possible. Option 2, just nail some wheels to your tower,  and sneek in into your dads room when he’s sleeping :3</p>

<p>lighting my computer on fire isn’t an option because computers don’t burn. FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU</p>
<p>Is there any way I can take the linksys wrt54G or something similar, connect it wirelessly to the dir-655, and then connect my pc directly to the linksys wrt54G? And also eliminate the problem?</p>

<p>Solutions???<br>
Wired isn’t an option and nothing other than the isp and and the router have changed so 3. and 4. shouldn’t’ be the problem. And I don’t think 1. is it either because all other computers connected are fine and everything but gaming works (usually).</p>
<p>If the only solution is to buy a good wireless card, what are some suggestions? I want one that wont’ have any trouble whatsoever because if I have to go through 4 wireless cards I will be pissed as hell.</p>

            <p>Okay, so I have a cheap tew-643pi wireless card and I have had nothing but trouble with it. It’s biggest problem is online gaming. It sometimes worked perfectly and other time not at all. I recently switched from my old internet, at&amp;t broadband, to comcast (which is well over twice as fast) and now it works okay for regular web browsing but it can’t play online games at all. Modern Warfare 2 is completely unplayable. Other games like L4D2 are playable, but go between 100 to 1000 ping. What could be wrong??? Also, the drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>I also switched routers to a DIR-655 d-link router if it could be the problem.</p>
<p>I had problems with my last wireless card as well; it caused my computer to stutter. I gave it to a friend and it’s been working fine on his computer but I don’t see how it could be a problem with my comp as I tried switching the pci slots and make sure it was mounted correctly and everything.</p>
