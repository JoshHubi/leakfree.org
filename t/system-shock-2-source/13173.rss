    <title>System Shock 2: Source?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/system-shock-2-source/13173</link>
    <description>Hello, my name is LucasGodzilla and I wonder if anyone has any experience with Black Mesa mods. I have an interesting idea of making a mod that remake the horror sci-fi game System Shock 2. If anyone have modding experience, please friend me on steam. My username is the same.  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>You’ve been doing everything wrong, so far. You need to show you’re willing to do something yourself. Show us something you’ve made that actually counts. We don’t want to see slightly edited faces in GMod; we want to see models made from scratch, maps made in hammer, or just about ANYTHING that can prove you’re willing to undertake being the leader of such a huge project. The very first thing you should’ve done was post a little bit of media you made yourself, it didn’t have to be a lot, just enough to prove your point: which should be that you’re a capable leader who knows enough about mods to start a project.</p>
<p>But no. Instead you’ve chosen to bitch and whine about how no one of us will do this for you, which is what you’re really asking for. No one wants to help you, because you’re seemingly not going to help in any way yourself. Go and learn how to properly propose an idea, how to properly assemble and inspire a team, how to properly lead them, and most importantly: how to properly do modding yourself. Then maybe you’ll be ready to take on a <span class="bbcode-i">small</span> project.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing modding since I was 9. I started out with Goldsource, and now I know to operate Goldsource, Source, UDK, CryEngine and numerous programs such as 3ds Max and Photoshop. I still don’t think I’m ready to take on a project of any kind (much less lead one), I still see myself as an amateur, because I am exactly that.</p>
<p>Just leave. Leave already, so you don’t stain your reputation any more. You’ll be able to salvage the little bit of dignity you have left, and start learning how modding is much more complex than you seem to think. I’m not asking you to leave because I don’t like you, I’m asking you to leave because if you continue doing this, you’ll just embarrass yourself further.</p>

<p>That’s the THING. I can’t fully model or anything. That’s why I request some help to model stuff for me, etc.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What you’re doing wrong is attempting to do something beyond the reach of your skills before you understand what you’re actually getting into. Do you understand what it takes to make a mod like this?</p>
<p>If you do understand completely, then list everything you need here. State your goals, your vision, projected progress and expected pitfalls, requirements, and desired features. Tell us your artistic direction, gameplay ideas, and everything that you want to achieve, and not only that, tell us EXACTLY how you can see yourself and a good team achieving those goals.</p>
<p>Like I said before, without a solid vision and plan, you’re going to need some extreme amount of luck to make up for it, which you can only really get from someone with very good modding experience and leadership skills.</p>
<p>The way I see it, your mod has two possible outcomes if you continue to think that doing what you’re doing is a good idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your project will fail either due to lack of support, or due to a mishmash of mismanagement issues. Your progress will be hindered by a lack of solid vision and solid execution. If you do manage to pump out a product, the result will overall be sub-par. Conflicting visions for the mod might lead to team conflict, and you may not be able to put together a unified product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less likely than possibility 1, but still possible, you might get extraordinarily lucky and find someone who actually knows what they’re doing, has the correct leadership skills and modding experience, and is able to pick up the slack where you cannot provide it. This hypothetical person would easily displace you as a leader figure, which means you would be out of work since you don’t seem to have any other significant skills to contribute to your team. You would be marginalized, which would lead to conflict that can’t be resolved. The result would not be pretty.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>Oh, that’s a load seeing as most of it was general, not specifically Source.</p>
<p>Pop Quiz!<br>
Please write down your answers below. Showing your work and citing your sources is preferable, however not necessary.<br>
[COLOR=’<span class="hashtag">#191919</span>’]|</p>
<ul>
<li>What should one provide when asking for team members? Please be specific.</li>
<li>Have you provided this? [COLOR=‘Silver’](Hint: <span class="bbcode-i">“No.”</span>)<br>
[COLOR=’<span class="hashtag">#191919</span>’]|</li>
<li>At what time is it acceptable to ask for team members? Please be specific.</li>
<li>Are you at this point? [COLOR=‘Silver’](Hint: <span class="bbcode-i">“No.”</span>)<br>
[COLOR=’<span class="hashtag">#191919</span>’]|</li>
<li>Should a looking-to-be developer with no extensive experience in at least one component of development begin a large-scale, ambitious project? Why?</li>
<li>Is this what you are, and are doing? [COLOR=‘Silver’](Hint: <span class="bbcode-i">“Yes.”</span>)<br>
[COLOR=’<span class="hashtag">#191919</span>’]|</li>
<li>Should an “Ideas Guy” attempt to build a team for a project? Why?</li>
<li>Is this what you are, and are doing? [COLOR=‘Silver’](Hint: <span class="bbcode-i">“Yes.”</span>)<br>
[COLOR=’<span class="hashtag">#191919</span>’]|</li>
<li>Should a looking-to-be developer that is incapable of reading basic laymen’s documentation dismiss the advice of various talented developers? Why?</li>
<li>Is this what you are, and are doing? [COLOR=‘Silver’](Hint: <span class="bbcode-i">“Yes.”</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have time for this simple test, you do not have time to devote to a project of any scale.</p>
<p>If you cannot answer all of these questions off the top of your head, you are absolutely positively full of shit, and did not thoroughly read a single link you’ve been given. In this case, you are completely helpless, useless, and are too incompetent to head a project of any scale at this point in time.</p>

<p>People, I know a little bit in almost everything to modding (Model, Sound, Script, Map, etc), but It’s not enough to fully make a mod by myself. I can help my mod team, but I can’t do this mod myself. Please, anyone with modding experience come out!</p>
<p>P.S. You guys gave me NO advice, just a lot of gossip and bitching. I want help not advice!</p>

<p>They gave you a ton of advice and you repeatedly avoided detailing the skills you have. Instead of getting confrontational about it, try actually listening to what they have to say.</p>
<p>Edit: Naturally my browser decided to hide a few pages of stuff until AFTER I posted that, but my point still stands. Probably.</p>

<p>Holy crap you are good! I sent you a friend request on steam and a group invite for the mod. Is it possible if you could work on the human models or the V_hands model soon?</p>

<p>You guys are a bunch of jerks. Lucas I think your endeavor is respectful and inspiring. I have taken it upon myself to help out with this mod, mainly because I love system shock (it happens to be my favorite series of all time. This got me so excited that I started modeling the wrench right away. It’s only been about 15 mins of work so far but I will work more.<br>
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6622687/Wrench.png" alt="" width="" height=""> I’m just getting the basic shape down right now. Working on handle. Will come with an update soon.</p>
