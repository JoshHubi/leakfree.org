    <title>Can&#39;t launch game, SteamStartup() failed</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-launch-game-steamstartup-failed/13223</link>
    <description>Hey everyone.
So I&#39;ve just installed Black Mesa, followed the instructions, download the Source SDK Base 2007.
Every time Im trying to launch the game I get the following error:

[b]&quot;SteamStartup() failed: SteamAPI_Init_Internal failed&quot;.[/b]
Screenshot:

I&#39;ve tried to reinstall both the SDK and the mod multiple times with no luck.

Source SDK Base 2007 is in : C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Source SDK Base 2007

BMS is in: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\SourceMods\BMS

Downloaded SourceSDK as well.

If it gives any clue, trying to run hl2.exe from the Source SDK folder gets the same error message, so I guess that means the error is comming from the SDK.

Any help will be appreciated.</description>
