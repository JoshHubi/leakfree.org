    <title>Computer Freezing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-freezing/2388</link>
    <description>My computer has been doing this thing on and off where it freezes for about a second and then goes back to normal. If there&#39;s any music playing while it does this the music will repeat and make a grating noise. It usually happens about once every 10-20 seconds and it seems like it only goes away entirely when I jiggle my hard drive cable. After about 2 or 3 weeks the problem will come back and I will jiggle my HD cable again. Just this morning I ran a clean install of Windows 7 (my old os was xp) and now the thing is back and it happens every 2 or 3 seconds. I jiggled my hard drive cable a bunch and even unplugged it and cleaned it but the problem just got worse. Any suggestions? I really need to get this fixed my computer is unusable. :&#39;(:fffuuu:

Also, I don&#39;t notice any freezing while the computer is booting up and it seems to get worse and worse the longer the computer is on.

EDIT: the problem went away on its own, but I would still like to know what is causing this because it will come back.

EDIT2: It&#39;s coming and going. It seems to get worse if I run windows media player

EDIT3:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH make it stop!!!!!!!!!!!! :&#39;(:&#39;(:&#39;(
My internet goes out whenever it happens.</description>

            <p>just in case if you still get freezes: don’t forget to check the temperatures of CPU, GPU and board - overheating is the most reason that causes a system to freeze without any error message. the second reason could be a power supply that just doesn’t provide enough power for the whole system or can’t hold the 12v power on the 12v power rail.</p>
<p>and if you got anoter bluescreen: just post the stop-error number here.</p>

            <p>I think I may have identified the problem; I noticed that the freezing occurred more often and sometimes ONLY when I tried to access the internet, regardless of the browser or program. My computer started freezing really really badly (like it does every other day) regardless of what I was doing and if I was using the internet, so I turned it off and took out my wireless card and turned it back on. No freezing. I turned it off and put the wireless card back in and it started freezing again. I’ve taken the card back out and have had it out for about 2 days with no freezing. I reinstalled the driver for the third or fourth time and had no luck. I changed the card’s port and it still froze. I also cleaned off any dust on the card. Right now I’m waiting on a friend to see if I can borrow a wireless card from him and plug it into my computer to make sure it’s the card itself, not the motherboard.</p>
<p>So happy I think I’ve finally figured out what’s wrong with this thing and it’s not that expensive.</p>

<p>Don’t listen to those saying monitors don’t use EDID after 2000s. That’s plain bullshit. Every VESA-compatible monitor/TV has EDID; I mean how could it be “Plug &amp; Play” without an EDID? If you have an at least VGA (640x480, 16 colors) monitor, then it has EDID, and Windows should detect it as “PnP”. If it’s detected as “Generic Non PnP”, then the EDID is corrupt, no doubt about that.</p>
<p>I don’t know why you complicate things? Grab the monitor, take it to a friend’s computer, or bring a friend’s computer to your monitor. Attach it on the <span class="bbcode-u">same port</span> (D-SUB / DVI / HDMI) you were getting low res. If your friend’s Windows again detects it as a “Generic Non PnP” and you’re stuck at low res (something below your native resolution) then definitely the EDID is screwed.</p>

            <p>I haven’t had any problems at all with the glitching since I moved my HD’s SATA cable to a different plug-in so I am pretty sure that that problem is resolved.</p>
<p>What happened was, on my first install of windows 7, the computer started freezing very badly, so I killed the power using the switch in the back. When I turned the computer back on, it started calling my monitor generic non-pnp and not letting me set the resolution above a certain point. I reinstalled my drivers and the problem persisted so I reinstalled windows 7 and all my drivers and the problem was still there. Also, most of the drivers I am using are the latest versions from online not from disks. My display driver is the newest version from <a href="http://Nvidia.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Nvidia.com</a>. My monitor’s driver is from a disk, but I’ve searched very very hard and it appears that there are no drivers for it online, I am assuming this is because the monitor doesn’t need a driver. The monitor is a 25-inch iH252.</p>
<p>My monitor’s symptoms exactly match that of a corrupt EDID, so I am pretty sure that is the problem.</p>
<p>EDIT: oh yes, and my monitor is plugged into my graphics card.</p>

            <p>Okay here is my two cents.</p>
<p>The problem with the intermittent lock ups is similar to a problem I had recently. I had xp installed and it was showing symptoms similar to yours. I reformatted and installed Windows 7 because I wanted to be lazy and just start fresh then trouble shoot possible software problems, but the issues only got worse.</p>
<p>I tested RAM with memtest 86+ and it checked out fine. Tested HDDs with read/write testers. No problems there. Thought it might’ve been the cpu but didn’t really decide to try another one because I lacked extra thermal paste.</p>
<p>After running all these tests I decided to monitor the system with the resource monitor (ctrl+shift+esc and then click resource monitor button). It seemed fine sitting idle, no problems, but when I ran programs and used the system, my HDD activity meter would spike whenever it locked up. The spikes though, when hitting 100%, were WAY below the rated speeds for the HDD. I grabbed a spare drive and threw XP on it and the system runs like a champ, no problems. I tried formatting the drive that had windows 7 for kicks and giggles and it wouldn’t let me format. It kept failing.</p>
<p>If the problem persists after you switched the SATA port, it MAY be your HDD. First though see if it is your cable by switching to another one if there is an extra SATA cable lying around.</p>
<p>Your video issues are interesting though. If I understand correctly, you had Windows 7 installed once and using the drivers provided on the cd, everything worked fine. Then you reinstalled Windows 7 and tried to use the drivers provided and now you can’t get your proper resolution to stay?</p>
<p>Not trying to insult your intelligence, but do you have your monitor plugged into your motherboard (if it has onboard graphics capability) or your video card. Sometimes it’s the little mistakes that drive people crazy when the fix is something as simple as making sure the plugs are in the right places.</p>
<p>Anywho, hopefully this info will help you out and at the very least point you in the right direction.</p>

</aside>
<p>Then what should I do about the EDID? My computer is stuck in a really shitty resolution. Also, I have forced a higher frequency with Nvidia control panel and it said “out of range”.</p>
<p>EDIT: Fuck fuck fuckity fuck fuck. Right as I posted this it did it again. I think. It was only a tiny bit, so maybe it was the music I’m listening to or I just imagined it.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Alright, I’m pretty sure it was the music.</p>

<p>My computer has been doing this thing on and off where it freezes for about a second and then goes back to normal. If there’s any music playing while it does this the music will repeat and make a grating noise.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is your sound builtin or on PCI?</p>
<p>My builtin AC97 junk in my D865GLC did something similar. I disabled the onboard sound in the bios and got a cheap sound card.</p>
<p>I don’t see how jiggling the HD cable will do anything, but you got the right idea. If you do, say, have an Audigy or X-Fi or Asus Xonar, I suggest taking it out and reseating it. In fact, you may want to reseat just about everything anyway.</p>
<p>The worst thing dust can do is causing things to over heat. Using a vacuum should be no big deal. Static discharge is a possibility, but unlikely.</p>

            <p>^ This.</p>
<p>But I’m afraid you’re not going to successfully switch the CPU, since the other one is 6 years old… I guess it’s probably not the same socket.</p>
<p>You said the problem started about 2 months ago… do you remember any event associated with it? Something like someone kicked your pc, or a new software downloaded from <a href="https://www.freeviruses.net" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.freeviruses.net</a>, or something like that, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, and you said that the problem seems to get a little better when you do something with the HD cable. Is this still truth?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve switched around the RAM cards a lot, and one appears to work worse than the other. I haven’t tried switching the old cpu, I guess I can try that now but I’m afraid the cpu will be too slow to run windows 7. The problem started probably around 1 to 2 months ago, and only got bad when I installed windows 7.</p>
<p>I ran memtest for 3 hours on one of my cards and no errors showed up. I’ll leave the test running over night on my other card.</p>

<p>He doesn’t charge, but I’d offer to pay him anyway.<br>
I already ran memtest, but I only ran it for 40 mins with both RAM cards in, I’ll try again.</p>
