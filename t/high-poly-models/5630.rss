    <title>High poly models</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/high-poly-models/5630</link>
    <description>Im not sure if this is in the right part of the forum, but I was just looking through the wiki and i was amazed with the detail on the high poly models. So i was wondering if it was possible to be able to switch between the normal in-game models (for peple with normal computers), and the high poly models (for people with big, expensive, gaming computer)?  :smiley:</description>

            <p>The hi-poly models are far too detailed for normal in-game use, even with very powerful computers. If a scene requires several instances of those hi-poly models on the same scene, even your beefy computer would easily start to have difficulty maintaining a stable framerate processing so many polygons at the same time.</p>
<p>Besides, those models are used as a base to make normal maps for the in-game models, they donâ€™t even get textured or animated.</p>

            <p>There is no high or low poly models, the graphics of BM will adjust your computer performances.</p>
