    <title>God of War 3 [Official Thread]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/god-of-war-3-official-thread/3218</link>
    <description>Well the bets are in. The cats are out of the bags. Demos have been released. Tv spots have been spotted. Its finally here! 

The official God of War 3 thread.

To start this one off, I&#39;d like to say that the demo has been opened to the general PlayStation© users for about two weeks now. And it was an epic one. 

I specifically enjoyed the flight in the vent near the ending. Also, it seems they will be doing some fancy stuff with the camera. Like the part where the minotaur creeps up behind you and you see the snake in the back scene. Some really hot s@#t. 

The GOW games have just been pure entertainment gaming. Nothing like a tapping sequence to tear a guy&#39;s head off.

P.S. Well all knew this thread was coming.</description>

            <p>Yea, I wasn’t crazy about the spam of brand new weapons in Gow 2. It felt like they weren’t needed. I gotta say though playing the demo of Gow 3 is just too epic. I’ve played it countless times now and it never gets old.</p>

<p>Its really worth it. They did a good job re-rendering the games and upscaling them to hd.</p>

            <p>My sincere welcome to you sir. Sometimes its hard to discern the legitimacy of a thread with all the non-fps and non-pc gaming threads on this website. And with no one possibly being a fan of the franchise, I doubt it will catch on.</p>

            <p>My sincere thanks for putting “Official Thread” in the title. It really helps me to distinguish from all the unofficial God of War threads that are out there on this predominately PC and fps related forum.</p>
