            <p>of course we need , in order to play cinematic-like games , make models using our hands n shit , but it’s less or more accurate , i belive that  the industry will hit a halt in the next 10 years , computers have gone quite far in the last 100 years , i could say faster then any industry out there , too bad there are retarded people who can’t run installers and wanted consoles… , now they’re pulling us down …</p>
<p>as i said , they need to re-aim the industry , yes we know money is good , but you can make more money from new / better stuff no?</p>

            <p>Agreed Max, its not the hardware thats the problem, its the software. The end user also limmits the advancement. Technology wont push as far if we cant afford it. No company is going to make each component costs thousends and attempt to throw it into the mainstream if we cant have it.</p>

<p>GPU capabilities are actually developing rather quickly at the moment.<br>
What is holding many things back is the software side, and consoles holding back major titles that would otherwise push hardware more.<br>
Because cross platform games do better financially, in general, many new games are designed for consoles as well as PCs Because it’s been a while since a next gen console came out games aren’t pushing hardware because you need it to scale to the relatively old hardware currently running consoles.</p>

Considering that GDDR<span class="bbcode-b">5</span>[/SIZE] is already in use on video cards, I don’t think you should get too caught up on that. Memory bandwidth and latency isn’t as much a bottleneck as sheer GPU power.<br>

<p>what exactly is keeping them from making video cards with i7 processors and tri-channel 4 gb ddr3’s 2000 hz memories? , i know they will cost as much as a computer , but they will last 20 years as far as performance goes ,</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>[was written before the 1st paragraph ] it seems that the selling of ps2 has accelerated in romania due to price cuts , it seems that my county will always be found to this theory ," wait t’il it gets cheap and not dead" , it’s hard to imagine that any time soon the playstation 2  will die , but the xbox seems to have , did it die or romania just isn’t one of the coutries that it’s publictated ?</p>

<p>i heard the guys that are making red faction 3 saing : it pushed the 360 to the limit , so basily , currentgen is becoming oldgen , this fast? , i think new consoles that are technological untouchble should be released no?</p>
