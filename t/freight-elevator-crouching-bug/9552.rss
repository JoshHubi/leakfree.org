    <title>Freight Elevator ~ Crouching Bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/freight-elevator-crouching-bug/9552</link>
    <description>When you crouch on the massive freight elevator, it stops, then stutters, then carries on moving. Not a huuuge bug, but it does break immersion.

[b]Note:[/b] I only noticed this when crouching in one of the corners. It could be that the rest of the elevator is fine and that I may have been getting &quot;stuck&quot; on a bit of wall, but I don&#39;t think I was that close.</description>
