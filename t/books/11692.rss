    <description>I think we should have a place where we can dump our pseudo-reviews and discuss the stuff we&#39;ve been reading recently. I&#39;ll begin.

---

I recently finished [b][url=&#39;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Zero-Novel-Rob-Reid/dp/0345534417/&#39;]Year Zero[/url][/b] by Rob Reid. It was so uneven in quality. At points it was humorous and entertaining, and at others it was groan-inducing and laborious. Rob Reid makes some excellent points about the state of the music industry and their litigiousness, but I think his problem here is he&#39;s trying too hard to be Douglas Adams. If you want to see Reid at his best, [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZadCj8O1-0&#39;]check out his Ted talk here[/url]. [b]3/5[/b]

Changing themes a little bit, a friend recently lent me his copy of t[b][url=&#39;https://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Cosmos-Space-Texture-Reality/dp/0375727205/&#39;]he Fabric of the Cosmos[/url][/b], authored by Brian Greene. Damn, this is a great book. Thought provoking and insightful from the very first paragraph, Greene really has a knack for making high-level material understandable, even for someone as dense as I am. I&#39;m only about 3/4 of the way through the book, but it&#39;s really engrossing. If you have even a fleeting interest in physics, and even if you don&#39;t like to concern yourself with math and equations, give it a read. It&#39;s given me plenty of insights into the world around me. [b]5/5[/b]

I also just finished up [b][url=&#39;https://www.amazon.com/Cats-Cradle-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/038533348X/&#39;]Cat&#39;s Cradle[/url][/b] for what was probably the third or fourth time. I fell in love with Vonnegut in high school and wanted to commit to reading his complete works (novels, at the very least) before the year&#39;s up. [b]5/5[/b]

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Last books I read are:</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shantaram-Novel-Gregory-David-Roberts/dp/0312330537/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353276563&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=shantaram" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Shantaram</span></span></a>”, by <span class="bbcode-b">Gregory David Roberts</span>. An Australian man flees from a high-security prison and start a life anew in India, becoming a smuggler, a doctor, a criminal… but apart the action and the romanticism, is the “picture” of India it communicates that makes the book great. You feel like you were there, and you’ll be glad of it. I loved it.<br>
Interesting fact: it’s based on Roberts’ own life (a bit fictionalized, of course, but he <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> escaped the Australian prison and went to India and etcetera).<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4.5/5</span></p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Wind-Carlos-Ruiz-Zaf%C3%B3n/dp/0143034901/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353276842&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+shadow+of+the+wind" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">The Shadow Of The Wind</span></span></a>”, by <span class="bbcode-b">Carlos Ruiz Zafón</span>. A very interesting “detective” thriller, set in 1950s Barcelona. A young boy goes with his father in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and finds a novel that should not exist from an author who has mysteriously disappeared, and tries to uncover the truth. Let’s just say that mysteries will deploy other mysteries… and things will take bad turns…<br>
Well written, very, very captivating and addictive, and plain fun.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4.5/5</span></p>
<p>I am now reading “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Remains-Day-Kazuo-Ishiguro/dp/0679731725/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353277386&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+remains+of+the+day" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">The Remains Of The Day</span></span></a>”, by <span class="bbcode-b">Kazuo Ishiguro</span>, but I’m still at the beginning, thus can’t say much about it…</p>

<p>While I can’t say that the story itself was particularly enjoyable, or that I was entertained in the slightest, I did still somehow enjoy reading it, and I found it quite interesting.</p>
<p>It’s hard even trying to describe it considering the very unique style it has.</p>

<p>I assume you’re referring to the Kafka novel.  I loved it.  The bureaucracy portrayed in the book is pretty much the same as modern day Germany.  Ahaha, it’s utterly maddening.<br>
I loved the way it oozed frustration and absurdity.</p>

            <p>I’m currently reading Dead Souls by Gogol.  I had previously read his short stories and loved them, so I thought it was about time I checked out his longer novels.</p>
<p>I’m only 50 pages in, but so far so good.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Breakfast of Champions is my favorite Vonnegut book. Athough it’s probably his most well known, I think Slaughterhouse 5 is my least favorite of his that I’ve read.</p>
<p>Finished 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami not long ago and I’m about to start Anathem by Neal Stephenson. Digging the long novels right now I guess, both are 1000+ page beasts.</p>

<p>Slaughterhouse-Five was the first book of his I read. I’m working on Man Without a Country at the moment (I had no idea his essays would rival his fiction), and I’ll make sure to hit those two next.</p>

            <p>I recently finished reading Poisonwood Bible and As I Lay Dying out of necessity (ie to pass literature class).</p>

<p>finished <span class="bbcode-i">The Catcher in the Rye</span> yesterday… Although <span class="bbcode-i">Salinger</span> is considered world literature and I had high expectations reading it (GITS SAC  got me on this) it somehow turned out plain boring and I don’t really see the transition of the main character…<br>

</aside>
<p>Catcher in the Rye was the first book that I ever read completely through in one sitting. Couldn’t put it down. I was a teenager when I read it so, that was probably the reason that it had such an impact on me. The only reason I can think that you wouldn’t have enjoyed it is you are either too young or too old to empathize with the character. I’s considered a great piece of literature for a reason.</p>

            <p>The only Canadian author I can think of reading at the moment is Douglas Coupland. He’s okay.<br>
I’m more of a science reader. Just finished reading ‘A Brief History of Time’ again. Looking into reading a Michio Kaku book next.</p>

            <p>I’ve been thinking about picking this book named Barometer Rising, which is a Canadian Novel often included in high school curriculums. Any Canadian fellas read this yet? Would it be worth it?</p>

            <p>I started reading <span class="bbcode-i">Dragonflight</span> a while, but I had a lot of trouble getting into it. Maybe I’ll get around to finishing it if and when I pick up a new charger for my Kindle fire, as my current one is broken.</p>

            <p>finished <span class="bbcode-i">The Catcher in the Rye</span> yesterday… Although <span class="bbcode-i">Salinger</span> is considered world literature and I had high expectations reading it (GITS SAC  got me on this) it somehow turned out plain boring and I don’t really see the transition of the main character…<br>

            <p>I think we should have a place where we can dump our pseudo-reviews and discuss the stuff we’ve been reading recently. I’ll begin.</p>
<hr>
<p>I recently finished <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Year-Zero-Novel-Rob-Reid/dp/0345534417/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Year Zero</a></span> by Rob Reid. It was so uneven in quality. At points it was humorous and entertaining, and at others it was groan-inducing and laborious. Rob Reid makes some excellent points about the state of the music industry and their litigiousness, but I think his problem here is he’s trying too hard to be Douglas Adams. If you want to see Reid at his best, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZadCj8O1-0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">check out his Ted talk here</a>. <span class="bbcode-b">3/5</span></p>
<p>Changing themes a little bit, a friend recently lent me his copy of t<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Cosmos-Space-Texture-Reality/dp/0375727205/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">he Fabric of the Cosmos</a></span>, authored by Brian Greene. Damn, this is a great book. Thought provoking and insightful from the very first paragraph, Greene really has a knack for making high-level material understandable, even for someone as dense as I am. I’m only about 3/4 of the way through the book, but it’s really engrossing. If you have even a fleeting interest in physics, and even if you don’t like to concern yourself with math and equations, give it a read. It’s given me plenty of insights into the world around me. <span class="bbcode-b">5/5</span></p>
<p>I also just finished up <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cats-Cradle-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/038533348X/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Cat’s Cradle</a></span> for what was probably the third or fourth time. I fell in love with Vonnegut in high school and wanted to commit to reading his complete works (novels, at the very least) before the year’s up. <span class="bbcode-b">5/5</span></p>
