    <title>Help me remember this movie.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-me-remember-this-movie/9296</link>
    <description>Alright people. I need help remembering an asian movie. I don&#39;t know which country, chinese or japanese maybe but definitely not indian.

I can only remember the ending of the movie and only minor details but I hope it helps. It&#39;s a comedy? [b]cooking movie[/b] with a small [b]cooking competition[/b] at the end. They present food like [b]hotcold bear paw[/b]  and still alive [b]monkey brain[/b]. Turns out the monkey brain is made out of soya and the monkey sounds were coming from a toy? under the table.

The movie is not Tampopo or Man eat drink woman.

I don&#39;t know if you guys watch a lot of asian movies so I put up all my hope into Fong.</description>

<p>a jungle fighter of some sort comes to a house and is supposed to kill the proprietor. The wife sees him entering the house and tries to distract him with her - eehm - body. The Fighter then stabs her with a bush knife.</p>
<p>Anybody know that movie?</p>
