    <title>english application, please help</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/english-application-please-help/4818</link>
    <description>I wrote an application in english but I don&#39;t have anyone speaking english native to check for issues. If some of the true BM forum guys could help me out a bit it would be a great pleasure for me.
I have to send this in at least 14 hours so unfortunately you have to hurry a bit. I have written it in german first but I found out that that would not be so good and I really want that internship.

Here is it:

Dear *game company* ,
I am writing to apply for a 2 week internship from *date1* to *date2*. Currently I am a student at the grammar school *name of school* in *name of town*.
I have been educating myself in computers for 5 years now and found my primary interests in software development.  The pure logic and creativity of programming languages fascinates me and have set my future targets.
After learning some Java for one year I started creating own game content with Autodesk Softimage, Valve’s Hammer Editor and Gimp. This tought me key aspects of software design as well as the development of a game. Great game modifications motivate me and give me reason to become better every day.
This internship is that important for me because I want to meet the people who developed the successful *gameengine*. So I can see what I have to achieve at least to become a very good programmer.


Ah yeah, this is not a joke.
giant thanks and cookies for everyone who help me.</description>

<p>haha.<br>
I only gave them my application today. They will call or mail back within 6 weeks. I didn’t see anything but a giant amount of monitors and computers. I walked through the whole complex. After I discovered that the few people who where working there thursday at 8pm only speaked english and russian or Polish or sth. I decided to rewrite my application in english.</p>

            <p>It sounds your writing a cover letter to supplement your portfolio/resume because no essay is require by crytek.</p>
<p>I’ve actually never had to write one for my resume, so I dont really know what they should contain and how long they should be.  What you have so far sounds good, I hope my OP helped though, let us know if you write anything else and need edits.</p>

<p>Crytek never contacted me. I was there today but I passed the work time so there was noone who was responsible for the applications. Just some guys doing their work.<br>
There was a total douche in our school who got an intern at Crytek. I thought if he gets an intern my chances of getting one would be very high.<br>
It’s also a school internship but I don’t write that in my application.</p>

            <p>Thanks!<br>
Omg, now I realise how bad mine was. The words “grammar school” are important here so I have to use them. It has to do something with the school system here in germany.<br>
More suggestions would be great.</p>
<p>What does “enclose a finger” mean? I think I am not able to write scraps of newsprint. Do you mean rorriamesus text?<br>

<p>Dear <em>game company</em> ,<br>
I am writing to apply for a 2 week internship from <em>date1</em> to <em>date2</em>. Currently I am a student at the grammar school <em>name of school</em> in <em>name of town</em>.<br>
I have been educating myself in computers for 5 years now and found my primary interests in software development.  The pure logic and creativity of programming languages <span class="bbcode-u">fascinate</span> me and have set my future targets.<br>
After learning some Java for one year I started creating <span class="bbcode-u">my</span> own game content with Autodesk Softimage, Valve’s Hammer Editor and Gimp. This <span class="bbcode-u">taught</span> me key aspects of software design as well as the development of a game. Great game modifications motivate me and give me reason to become better every day.<br>
This internship is that important for me because I want to meet the people who developed the successful <em>gameengine</em>. So I can see what I have to achieve at least to become a very good programmer.</p>

<p>Corrections underlined. Can I ask what company you are applying to?</p>

            <p>Dear <em>game company</em>,</p>
<p>My name is <em>insert full name</em>.  I am <em>insert age</em> years old and am writing to apply for the 2 week internship from <em>date1</em> to <em>date2</em>. I am currently a student at <em>name of school</em> in <em>name of town</em>, <em>name of state</em>.  I find logic, and the creativity in programming languages, simply fascinating.</p>
<p>After 5 years of self-taught computer science, my primary interest is software development.  I have set my goals and am familiar with Java.  I create my own game content utilizing Autodesk Softimage, Valve’s Hammer Editor and Gimp. Vital skills for software design, as well as game development, have been reinforced through practice. Successful game modifications have provided me with the inspiration and motivation to improve.</p>
<p>While interning, I want to learn from the influential people who developed <em>game engine</em>, as well as offer my own strengths to the team. I hope to glimpse what can be accomplished through years of dedication.  Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Im certainly no expert, but i would start with something like that.  Good luck!</p>

            <p>I wrote an application in english but I don’t have anyone speaking english native to check for issues. If some of the true BM forum guys could help me out a bit it would be a great pleasure for me.<br>
I have to send this in at least 14 hours so unfortunately you have to hurry a bit. I have written it in german first but I found out that that would not be so good and I really want that internship.</p>
<p>Here is it:</p>
