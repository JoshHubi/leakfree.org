And when I come home,I’ll stand in front over my computer in accomplishment.<br>
(It dosent stop now)Then sit back,have a drink,and listen to the song,The Life And Times - Coat Of Arms.</p>

<p>Well, once BMS is released, I’m sacrificing an infant to Cthulu, then once the editing tools are out, I’m making a mod that’s an alternate universe in which the experiment goes fine, and Gordon goes about his daily life, working at Black Mesa, going home, coming back to Black Mesa, you get the picture.

            <p>Well, once BMS is released, I’m sacrificing an infant to Cthulu, then once the editing tools are out, I’m making a mod that’s an alternate universe in which the experiment goes fine, and Gordon goes about his daily life, working at Black Mesa, going home, coming back to Black Mesa, you get the picture. How we REALLY wanted half-life to be.</p>

<p>I’m going to play it.<br>
Then I’m going to either learn how to do so (or bitch at friends with the required skills) and put the M4 back in the game, then the HECU zombies and those “solder/security prayer” animations I mentioned in another thread.<br>
Then I’m playing it again to see if there’s any major difference (purple elephants, etc.).<br>
I’m also going to wait patiently for cosplayers to start mimicking Freeman outside Area 51.</p>

            <p>I’m going to be so excited when the mod is finally released that I’ll probably have to play a level at a time so I don’t have a heart attack. Going to be tough trying not to explode in ecstasy.</p>
