    <title>Most anticipated game?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/most-anticipated-game/352</link>
    <description>There are alot of good titles being released through 2009/10 such as assasins creed 2 in august, call of duty: modern warfare 2 in november and hopefully half-life 2 episode 3 in late december. But what game are you most looking forward to?

mine would be:

half-life 2 episode 3 :freeman:
duke nukem forever :pirate:
  Modern warfare 2 :jizz:
sims3 ([b][u]already leaked!![/u][/b]) :retard:
mafia 2 :fffuuu:
red dead redemption
call of juarez: bound in blood
LEFT 4 DEAD 2!!!!!

Can all these good games live up to expectations and [b]how great[/b] the first one was of that game?

Oh and Black mesa does not count it is a mod!</description>

            <p>Talking more about the underlying system of it, relying on dice rolls, psuedo turns and such. It’s meant for PnP which causes problems in game design you actually have to work around for a CRPG. It worked well in BG yep, but the new system removes constraints and so is theoretically better and at least easier to work with.</p>

<p>The AD&amp;D2 rules are perfect for RPG’s.</p>
<p>It’s what made the gameplay of Baldur’s Gate awesome.</p>

<p>What it doesn’t have is a broad range of classes and alignments like it should.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The actual number of base classes is irrelevant if you can customise them so much that any two people of the same “class” have vastly different abilities and tools at their disposal.</p>
<p>The alignment system is unnecessary and simplifies moral choice.</p>
<p>I didn’t say it was going to be the exact same game, they are making improvements where necessary. Hell it’s not even using D&amp;D because they realised that’s a backwards assed system for CRPGs.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No it is BG’s spiritual successor, what it isn’t is a sequel.</p>
<p>Edit: What the devs mean by spiritual successor is tactical party based combat, medieval fantasy setting, strong story and characters, having isometric styled gameplay as an option. In that they feel they’ve captured the feeling of playing BG, even if it isn’t reusing the same story elements.</p>
<p>Combat actually looks more in depth than BG as well, fighter type characters have abilities now so can be used as more then meat shields while autoattacking.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah I’m not much interested in that… Bioware were the developers for BG 1+2 so they know what they’re doing when it comes to Dragon Age (except for some of the crap their marketing department have been doing with their latest trailers :fffuuu: ). When Interplay had the license they made the Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance console games and they don’t deserve the name.</p>
<p>Besides, the actual storyline is over for BG so any more games using the IP would just be a cash in, there’s no need for them to be in that setting again.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh and most the media you’ll see for it is from camera angles made to look more “actioney”, here’s some BG successor goodness<br>

            <p>I don’t play enough games to anticipate them.<br>
I guess I’m looking forward to Episode 3, see the end of this story arc, but I’m not holding my breath or anything.</p>
<p>My gaming routine is usually, play a game straight until I beat it, then not play anything else for a few months. Since September I’ve played Assassins Creed, a little TF2, Left 4 Dead, Roller Coaster Tycoon (the original was the best), GTA San Andreas, and I’m onto GTA 4 now.</p>

<p>I am curious as to why would you get flamed. And if you are referring to all those ‘Boycott Left 4 Dead 2’  idiots, I will go ahead and tell you to flame them instead, for being such ignorant fools.</p>

            <p>I think I already posted here saying that I couldn’t wait for HL3 and BM, but, besides those games, I can’t wait for… L4D2. And, before you flame me, let me tell you that it is because I am terrified of the dark; therefore, daytime campaigns sound good to me. Also, Wasabi’s link to the <a href="https://www.blackmesasource.com/forums/showthread.php?p=43620#post43620" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Spitter</a> in the “Ugly Enemy” thread might have something to do with it.</p>
