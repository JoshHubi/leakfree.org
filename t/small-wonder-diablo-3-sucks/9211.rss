So glad I didn&#39;t even think of buying that PoS

P.S. Heck, even Forbes picked up on that.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve been thinking it over and here’s some things that could’ve made Diablo 3 better, in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A different skill system: I guess something along the lines of what skyrim did. “Do something, get better at it”. What Skyrim did could work for Diablo and would make skill building a bit more difficult but not too dumbed down. Also, something OTHER than basing them on your gear. I’m thinking about them having a base damage or effect and on top of that, a certain percentage influenced by a attribute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different attribute system: Make it a little bit more restricted in the sense that you can’t just level up one atribute all the time. Having it conforming to some (somewhat loose) parameters for each class. Meaning that you can have say, a ranged barbarian and kick ass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring back gambling: Mainly because you can’t be sure to get something good out of the artisan if you level him up. That equals to money and items wasted. Also, a jeweler is kind of unnessary since you could…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring back the fucking Horadric Cube: I actually liked that six faced bronze son of a bitch. I liked crafting stuff for myself and mixing jewels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better mercenaries: By “better” I mean “they shut the fuck up”. While the billion times I played through D2, I never thought I’d say this but I miss the mercenaries. They actually did help, in their own way, even if they died and had to pay a kings ransom to bring that lance wielding motherfucker back. I say make them mute, more useful and with less skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having an inventory you don’t have to pay for: Because fucking seriously. About 80000 gold to have a stash larger than a mosquitos dick? It’s ridiculous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No auction house: You know what Blizzard, I don’t fucking care if the fans did this beforehand. Let fans still do it like they did, SPECIALLY if the drop is so poor that you’re practically forced to use it halfway into Nightmare. Don’t put it in, specially if you have to include DRM motherfuckery to support it not being rendered moot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, even if D3 is very shallow for a Diablo game, here’s something they did right:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Champions: I liked the direction the champions and uniques went. It makes for more active combat and is generally more fun than “Extra Strong, Cold enchanted, Extra Fast”. Besides with this, you can make the game more a little more tactical in nature, allowing for a somewhat fast paced but also thoughtful gameplay. But this is downplayed by the fact that they still fucked it up by not forbidding combinations that can render entire classes useless, which in turn, makes those same champions virtually innofensive to others. Also, if they explode when they die, at least they have the goddamn common courtesy to delay the explosion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More visually atractive skills: Something I definetly did not like about Diablo 2 were how boring the skills were visually. This may seem petty, but I like how Diablo 3 reflects the power of your skills, maiming not only your enemies but also the scenery. But it’s also kind of fucked, mainly because with just one player the screen can look so busy you can get confused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability lo dye your equipment: This may seem even pettier, but I didn’t like having a really useful armor looking like it was made of solidified cotton candy. I’m the kind of guy who’s obsessive enough to organize his stash and certainly don’t like maiming the hordes of hell looking like Payasokiin: Clownborn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No undead fetishes: Seriously, who the fucking christ on cheese sandwich thought that was a good idea? “Hey, you killed a monster. Reward: Death. Because fuck you”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">TL;DR:</span> Diablo 3 had a bunch of shit wrong, did about one thing right and fuck undead fetishes to the deepest pits of hell and back.</p>

<p>I love Starcraft 2 singleplayer as long as I’m inside an actual mission, playing. Everything’s really awesome, every mission has something special for it, controls are easy and powerful, visuals are stunning etc.<br>
Problems emerge when they are trying to tell a story OUTSIDE missions. There are visual/logic goofs, there are continuity problems, and worst of all is the retarded dialogue/story writing. Jim Raynor is holding crappy tears-inducing speeches about “Leaning on each other”, “Some things are just worth fighting for”, nobody questions why Tychus remains in the deathtrap suit even after Moebius Foundation joins forces with Raynor…</p>
<p>I mean, it’s very similar to Terminator movies. You watch them the first time and are just too occupied with drooling that you don’t see the blatant errors. But then you notice, when you watch it the second time, that:<br>
a) a terminator is easily able to break any bone in human body just by squeezing it in its hand, and<br>
b) many times, terminator (any of them) gets hold of the hero, but instead of simply crushing his/her skull/chest/arms, he throws the hero against walls or other stuff, punches him etc., thus giving the hero opportunty to escape. Doesn’t seem like a particularly clever thing from a machine DESIGNED to be efficient human-killer, right?</p>
<p>And that’s what’s happening with Starcraft 2’s story.</p>

</aside>
<p>and seemed to me like way to many of the missions in SC2 have little to do with whatever the main plot was, reminded me of Mass Effect 2 and all its recruiting missions, where’s the freaking story in these high-profile future space sagas?</p>

The complaints now are Diablo 3 and WoW: Mists of Pandaria, while the latter isn’t even bad just people don’t like the taste</p>

<p>In all honesty I’ve played through Diablo I &amp; II several times not paying one bit of attention to the lore. I don’t like having to read 10 pages of text every time I talk to an NPC.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That was the beauty of it btw. You could just skip the lore and PvE until there smoke out of your ears and your eyes start bleeding.</p>
<p>In D3 - not only the lore is terrible, but it is shoved down your throat every new playthrough.<br>

<p>In D3 it was spoken of her as a deceased person. Thus “look, she is alive and corrupted now, lulz!!! why not to rape her own daughter and transform her into ex-husband?” was lame.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I believe she left Caldeum and never came back, so everyone just began assuming she had perished in the desert?</p>
