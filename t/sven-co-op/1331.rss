    <description>I&#39;m finding it kind of hard to believe there&#39;s so many Half-Life fans here who have never seen/played/heard of the mod &#39;Sven Co-op&#39;. It&#39;s probably the most developed mod for HL1 (bar TFC?) and provides literally 100+ hours of fun. For the past 2 years the mod has been rather... dead, however in the last 6 months they have updated it to the new version (4.0/4.07) which is a VAST improvement. Basically they&#39;ve overhauled the NPC&#39;s (New models/AI/Attacks) and improved upon the weapons with again new models/animations/sounds.

There is a somewhat active mapping community who create some great maps involving objectives/killing enemies all with the help of your friends/randoms Online.

Like I said 100+ hours of fun, keeping your mind off the release of BM. Really, I recommend it.

Edit: 100+ hours of fun if you played version 3.0 with the large amount of maps.

Did I mention full HL1 main storyline online cooperative with full HD models?  :smiley: 


If you&#39;ve already played the mod I&#39;d love to hear some stories or praise from the game ^_^</description>

            <p>Back to the topic, I used to be a huge fan of Sven.  I even donated to it, too.  Interest fell off as other games came out and even though 4.0 is out I can’t see myself getting excited for it.  It really does depend on who you have as your teammates, too.</p>
<p>To those who complained about missing sequences, because of the problems they had with certain sequences that had you go back to previously visited maps, it was impossible to get them to work correctly, so they were cut.</p>

<p>No, it doesn’t. If something is obtuse, it is (besides being greater than 90°) indistinct or obscure. For example, many of my posts are obtuse.</p>

<p>That doesn’t sound right either. <span class="bbcode-i">Vague</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">ambiguous</span> do a better job of expressing that, without the risk of calling many of your own posts <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/obtuse#Adjective" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">intellectually dull or dim-witted</a>.</p>
<p>SC’s objectives can be ambiguous or vague, and the gameplay can be random and indiscriminate. But I can’t find any way to apply “<span class="bbcode-i">obtuse</span>” to SvenCoop other than when describing its playerbase.</p>

<p>Yes it’s true… 60% of the maps are terrible and only worthy of one playthrough, some not even one glance. The other 40% can be pretty fun though if you play with people you know and trust (and who aren’t retards who consistently block you and steal all the ammo).</p>
<p>Osprey isn’t a bad map… It’s a classic xD</p>

</aside>
<p>well, obtuse is used to refer to wide angles exceeding 90 degrees, and to things that are pointless, or lacking sense.<br>
I actually think the word is the most fitting one I could have used. It both refers to the lack of thought that i viewed, but also gives a slight nod to the wide variety of enemies placed and where they were placed.</p>

            <p>One of my most played games since I got it about 4 years ago, so many custom maps always being made keeps it alive; although I only lan it, its the only way to play it.</p>

            <p>It’s fun, but the HLSP campaign is pissing me off because they changed so much stuff.<br>
A) I think it would have been better with the original weapon models<br>
B) While the chaingun is epic, I think it would have been better without added/altered weapons<br>
C) How the hell do you finish WGH? They killed that scripted sequence! Do you have to go through the vents or something?</p>

            <p>I tried it, but between spawning obtuse number of enemies in obtuse places along with the fact that map transitions often skipped sections, killing my frame of reference, compounded by the fact that you couldn’t access any areas unless someone already joined you for multiplayer destroying any chance you had of simply dicking around while waiting for someone to join you, all pretty much shot down any interest I had in it.</p>

            <p>I’m finding it kind of hard to believe there’s so many Half-Life fans here who have never seen/played/heard of the mod ‘Sven Co-op’. It’s probably the most developed mod for HL1 (bar TFC?) and provides literally 100+ hours of fun. For the past 2 years the mod has been rather… dead, however in the last 6 months they have updated it to the new version (4.0/4.07) which is a VAST improvement. Basically they’ve overhauled the NPC’s (New models/AI/Attacks) and improved upon the weapons with again new models/animations/sounds.</p>
<p>There is a somewhat active mapping community who create some great maps involving objectives/killing enemies all with the help of your friends/randoms Online.</p>
<p>Like I said 100+ hours of fun, keeping your mind off the release of BM. Really, I recommend it.</p>

<p>Edit: 100+ hours of fun if you played version 3.0 with the large amount of maps.</p>
<p>Did I mention full HL1 main storyline online cooperative with full HD models?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>If you’ve already played the mod I’d love to hear some stories or praise from the game <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
