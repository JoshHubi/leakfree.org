<p>half-life 1: first (i think) story heavy FPS.<br>
half-life 2: in production just after the release of HL1, presumably before Halo was a concept–the whole time it was planned to be story heavy.</p>

<p>Just think for a minute… Before everyone and their mother played halo 2 - 3 multiplayer on xbl, and before everyone had played through the campaign hundreds of times… Halo was an epic step forward in video games imho… Without halo I don’t think later story-heavy FPS games would have (could have) been pushed to be what they are (and I include HL2 in that category).</p>

<p>I got nothing to say other than, someone who plays a shitty campaign more than once is invested in the story and is therefore a fan boy. Also, are you kidding me? Halo!? A step forward!? If anything, it was a step forward for the gamepad, nothing else. I’d like to see you say that to a room full of quake fans.</p>
<p>Judging by these remarks, I’m guessing you must be new to the FPS. I mean, you seriously think Half-life 1 isn’t story-heavy? You think it didn’t maybe lend a few pages to the bungie guys or inspire its sequel?</p>
<p>This is what I’m hearing. You’re saying that the backstreet boys were just as revolutionary as MJ. I call virginz on that! Stop listening to G4 man! They don’t know. Heck, gametrailers doesn’t even know.</p>

<p>I’m impressed that HL2 is still in the lead and has slightly increased the gap. I’m really curious now if it can beat a behemoth like WoW, even though Valve has released nothing new for HL2 in years</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When I stop and think about it, it’s hard to believe a HL2 fanbase can outvote a WoW fanbase. I just see WoW as holding the biggest number, simply because I hear an astronomically larger number of people randomly talk about WoW as apposed to HL2, but meh, my world is small</p>

I played it once, and it was like Sherwood Dungeon (Online MMORPG) And nearly the same, and you have to pay for WoW when SD was free and almost the same.</p>

<p>erm again it sounds like you had a quick glance and didnt see the full picture  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  i thought the same too until i actually tried to play and relised its a good game (was very sinicle about it at first) its nothing like sherwood that graphics sucks if there was a word for how sucky sherwoods graphics were i would use it and dip it in scooped up baby poo and horse radish and actually the graphics engine has been improved alot on Wow and lately with newest content its actually REALLY fun now…its not easy either  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  and actually the story of wow is based around you as one hero as it says in the quest descriptions its just theres more than one person as its multiplayer but if it was singleplayer if would be based around you  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>and hmm you also may need LBP in that list too for great games  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  can never get enough of that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But as aswell on the matter i almost forogt fallout 3! that is an awsome game (Agree by loads) tbh i like alot of games i am a game fan and can never say anything bad about games unless they really suck  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  like sherwood <em>shivers</em>  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Halo is boring, the concept was absolutely AMAZING, as were the guns, and it had a decent physics system aswell, but the story line? It was terrible compared to what it could have been, while it wasn’t that bad by itself, it just didn’t live up to the concept of the Halo world (which i think is quite possibly one of the coolest things ever to come up in a game). After all those little things got there it just got really boring, and then after an hour shooting tiny things for no apparent reason, the game bugged up, and a door wouldn’t open when it should have, i spent another hour trying to open it, and then gave up, and didn’t even finish the game.</p>
<p>bscly Halo= Good concept, shit story.</p>

<p>How is halo in any sort of contention with half-life 2 and wow. I mean, wow , I kind of understand. But halo, really!!! Halo was the most over rated game of the decade not the best. Masterchief appeals to 12 yr old gamers. I played it, and I was bored out of my freaking mind. Gordon would be pissed.</p>

</aside>
<p>You’re joking, right? Halo is, tbh, just as revolutionary as half-life is.</p>
<p>Just think for a minute… Before everyone and their mother played halo 2 - 3 multiplayer on xbl, and before everyone had played through the campaign hundreds of times… Halo was an epic step forward in video games imho… Without halo I don’t think later story-heavy FPS games would have (could have) been pushed to be what they are (and I include HL2 in that category).</p>
<p>e: and before you call me out on fanboyism, no: I do not play halo. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
But I’ve played through its campaign several times, and, considering when it was released, I know enough to realize that it is a revolutionary game, certainly capable as being one of the representative games of the decade.</p>
<p>Also: lol WoW.</p>

            <p>“wow has no story” &lt;===== the most redarded thing i have ever heared… the guys says that he played <span class="bbcode-u">once</span> is it enought to play game, in which world is in size of moon, enought to judge about it… wow has longers story and has been envolving for 15 years. it has the most detailed story in gameing histori and one of the biggest (after Might and Magic) in compareing to Half-Life its story is ginat… yeah HL has great storyline great gaphics but WOW has greater story and Greater universe. who wants to know what the story is they should play warcraft warcraft II and Warcraft III and if you don’t like story say it after playing those all… I love HL but wow is better…</p>

            <p>Well, it’s not entirely certain. Just like with the last it could be that Half Life has less unique ip’s than wow. Which could still result in WoW winning. We’ll have to see though. Certainly hope not.</p>

            <p>It almost seems pointless to pick a ‘game of the decade’… without a doubt, its been gaming’s largest decade ever… I mean really, think about it: Metroid Prime, HL2, Halo, Zelda WW and TP, GTA SA / IV, Mario Galaxy / Sunshine, Fable, FFXIII [well, jp ver], The introduction of music games to the US (Guitar Hero / Rock Band), revolutionary handheld gaming on the PSP and DS, TF2/Portal/L4D, Bioshock, the Call of Duty’s, Little Big Planet… I mean, that’s really just the very tip of the iceberg… the 00’s were insane for videogames, and I honestly don’t think anyone can pick THE game of the decade.</p>
<p>Think about how many games you’re talking about here… the ENTIRE libraries of the Ps2, GameCube, XBOX, GBA, DS, PS3, wii, 360, and most of DreamCast’s games… not to mention every game thats been released on XP/Vista.</p>
<p>There’s no way to just pick one game from all that <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Though, I gotta say, HL2 is a good choice if one had to be chosen :3</p>
