    <title>cant load c2a4f</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-load-c2a4f/13825</link>
    <description>So despite the minor issues ive had with Black Mesa that have yet to be solved,i still enjoy the game very much and ive played through it again but in unforseen consiquences ive met up with the guard who suggests we should go find scientists with retinal clearance and after i go to the hallway that loads c2a4f, hl2 stops working and the error message pops up and the game crashes. Ive tried opening it through the console but the error still pops up and crashes the game. Ive uninstalled the game and reinstalled and my issue still remains. Ive tried to load c2a4g via the console and that works just fine. i dont know what else doesnt work and this liitle bug is bothering me alot. I can withstand all the other minor problems with the game ive experienced but now its really starting to bother me. A fix would be more than appreciated</description>

            <p>Check to see if any .dmp files were created from your crash.  The are located in \Steam\dumps\ and are named something similar to crash_bms.exe_20150505021705_1.dmp, if you do have one from that crash specifically please either attach it to a reply (you may need to zip it up before doing so) or upload somewhere so we can investigate it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
