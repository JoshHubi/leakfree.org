<p>Sure it’s <span class="bbcode-i">based</span> on the Humdinga, but it’s better-ized. More defensively &amp; offensively capable. Plus it goes faster on the water, which is cooler.

            <p>Or they could of course fly well and drive well. Although I will defer to your superior abilities of randomly making up the future. Plus boatcars have been done for 60 years. We should move on.</p>

            <p>Except if you fly, there’s no fucking purpose to drive on the ground. At least boat-cars have a purpose. The reason these are neat is because they can do <span class="bbcode-i">both</span> of them pretty well, instead of doing them both really shittily. Which is what a flying car would do, drive like shit and fly like shit.</p>

            <p>Not this year, dear, maybe for your birthday.</p>
<p>…I’ve seen the first and third before, which are kind of ridiculous, but not the Humdinga. I actually understand what the it’s going after, a really effective niche. It’s actually a pretty good design which demands further research (and a better name).</p>
