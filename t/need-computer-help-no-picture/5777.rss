    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-computer-help-no-picture/5777</link>
    <description>My home PC isn&#39;t working. It&#39;s not getting any picture. The last time this happened I switched my monitor&#39;s connection from one graphics card to the other, and that solved it. This time none of the connections on either graphics card are working. Nvidia 8900 Ultras inj SLI (or was it 8800?) I don&#39;t know what to do...</description>

            <p>I’m not sure where you heard that, at the moment IMHO ATi/AMD has the best price/performance/heat/power consumption when it comes to their higher-end and upper mainstream cards.</p>

            <p>Don’t worry about it. I like Nvidia anyway  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Besides, I have heard that AMD doesn’t get along with open GL games, and I love quite a few of those.</p>

            <p>WTF? ATI cards don’t work in your machine but Nvidia cards do? Sorry that’s complete bollocks. All motherboards that have PCI-E cards can take GPU’s from either it’s just some have crossfire, SLI or both.</p>
<p>Did the IT guy get any GPU working with that PC? As mentioned before this looks like a faulty PCI-E slot.</p>
<p>EDIT - Sorry a bit of searching has shown people have a lot of problems with this motherboard and AMD/ATI cards as it has an Nvidia chipset which doesn’t play nice. That’s typical Nvidia to be honest, forcing the consumer into buying their proprietary stuff.</p>
<p>My bad, I think it was me who recommended the AMD card, I just assumed it would be okay. Sorry bud.</p>

            <p>Crap shit crap shit crap shit crap fuck shit fuck shit fuck crap shit fuck shit fuck!</p>
<p>I bought a new ATI sapphire card and the fucker shit fucking fuck shit fucking doesn’t work in my computer! I took it to a professional and he couldn’t get the shit fucking fucker to fucking work in it either. and he also confirmed my old video cards don’t work, my motherboard and power supply do, and only Nvidia cards work on my computer.</p>
<p>So now I need to buy a new Nvidia card to replace the old ones, and figure out how to get my money back on the ATI that I bought…</p>
<p>shit fucking cock fucker twat-ass motherfucking motherfucker motherfucking fuck shit fuck fuck <span class="bbcode-b">FUCK!!!</span></p>

            <p>Ok, it isn’t overheating, but it is definitely crapping out on me. Minecraft keeps locking up on me, or simply crashing to desktop saying that something is wrong with my card or my drivers. I removed and replaced all of the drivers, so I am betting on the three year old video card.</p>
<p>I will probably buy a new card if/when I get my next paycheck.</p>

            <p>Like I said earlier, use GPU-z to monitor temperature. Let it run in the background, play a demanding game for 30 minutes and check GPU-z to see the maximum temperatures that were reached. If they are around 90+ C you should be worried.</p>
<p>Download Rivatuner as well, and set the fanspeed to 100%</p>

<p>Not necessarily.</p>

<p>I think I spoke too soon. I think I overheated the card a couple hours ago. Shut down, let it rest for a bit, and now I’m only using it for internetting for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>I will probably be ordering a new card soon…</p>

<p>Well this error is obviously not related to the system memory, but if you want you can go to the manufacterers website and locate your memory kit using its product code. Then under details it usually lists the optimal timings for the memory. You could download CPU-z and see what timings they are currently running at, if they are on the high side then you might want to change them to get some more performance out of it. Always useful to have this program anyway.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of my memory, running at 8-8-8-24</p>

</aside>
<p>Hmm, I take it you are running a game when this happens? Is it every time with the same game? Perhaps try a different game. Are you running vista or windows 7?</p>
<p>You could try: (found this on a post on another forum)</p>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="https://www.guru3d.com/category/driversweeper/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Driver Sweeper</a> from Guru3D and install it.</li>
<li>Re-download the latest drivers from Nvidia.</li>
<li>Open Control Panel&gt;Add Remove Programs and uninstall the current ForceWare (display) driver.</li>
<li>Uninstall the PhysX driver (if present).</li>
<li>Reboot into Safe Mode (tap the F8 key after the POST screen).</li>
<li>Run Driver Sweeper and check “NVIDIA - Display” only.</li>
<li>Press “Clean” and wait for it to finish.</li>
<li>Reboot (normally).</li>
<li>Cancel any hardware wizard(s) that may appear.</li>
<li>Install the Forceware driver.</li>
<li>Reboot.</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT - It’s also worth downloading rivatuner and getting it to graph GPU temps. If it’s unusually high (above 90c) it can cause issues.</p>

<p>So you took the memory out then put it back in? Most memory doesn’t set its timings and voltage so you might want to go back in the BIOS and set the voltages and timings properly. The correct settings are usually found on the sticker on the side of the memory stick in the form of three or four numbers with a voltage behind it.</p>
<p>Whether this is actually your problem I’m just going to say it anyway.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>When you’re at the memory screen you’re gonna see a list of settings you can change by entering a number.</p>
<p>The timings on the memory above are listed as 6-6-6-18 @ 1.8 volt<br>
This means the first option you see in the memory screen must be set to “6”, the second to “6”, the third to “6” and the fourth option to “24”.</p>
<p>Leave the others at default. Don’t forget to change the voltage as well.</p>

<p>I don’t see anything that looks even close to that on my RAM…</p>
<p>But I did get the bad card removed from the motherboard, which makes me wonder how they got it in there int he first place…</p>

            <p>I have only been using one card or the other for over a year as using the SLI on this motherboard has been buggy since I bought it (when 8800 Ultras were brand new, whenever that was, I forgot, I’m going senile in my young age).</p>

            <p>Lol, most mid to high range GPU’s are 10" or longer now. Once you are running on just the one card that appears to be working it’s probably a good idea to tax it a bit and see if it causes any problems.</p>
<p>Remember to switch automatic restart off in order to see those blue screen codes.</p>
<p>Hopefully removing the faulty card completely will sort it out. I’m not sure whether replacing the 8800 ultra with the same card is worth it over getting a completely new card or not. You could also consider grabbing a Nvidia GTX 460 1gb (the msi and gigabyte versions overclock well and can meet the 6850 and possibly 6870 territory) and keeping the working 8800 as a physX card if you have any games that use it that is.</p>

            <p>No, I didn’t know that about the cards. I know (little) about RAM troubles because I have had RAM problems before. This is my first SLI system though, so I’m at a loss for everything.</p>
<p>And damn fuck shit those are two huge cards I have in there… I’m going to need to clear some shelf space to store them while I am playing around with everything.</p>

            <p>That’s fair enough, looks like it is at least one of the GPU’s are at fault then. It’s worth making sure you have identified the fault correctly before you invest in an expensive card. It would be pretty annoying if you get the same symptoms after spending a load of money.</p>
<p>Once you have a BSOD code that should help verify further. You will need to turn SLI off in the Nvidia driver and switch that connector around I referred to in the manual but you probably already know that.</p>
<p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

            <p>I have tested for RAM problems before. It passed with flying colors (or RAM, whichever). I didn’t know about re-timing them though. I will look into that tomorrow.</p>
<p>It rebooted automatically while trying to play Minecraft, which in retrospect was a little hasty of me to play…</p>
<p>I will fully pull out each GPU when I get a chance to get in there fully with some more time on my hands. After what happened last night I just felt confused and defeated, and was also really tired from my evening workout, so delving further in just wasn’t happening…</p>

<p>Ok, I pulled out the RAM (two sticks) one at a time and no beeps.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Did you pull <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> the RAM out and switch the power on at any point? It’s purely a test to see if the motherboard get’s past the BIOS and CPU test and squarks about lack of RAM. Clear the CMOS (refer to motherboard manual; downloads section <a href="https://usa.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=KyHOsOKWujC2QguJ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>) and then place one stick in a slot, attempt boot, if nothing try the next slot and so on. Repeat with the second stick. The reason for this is it’s unlikely that both sticks of ram have gone or all ram channels have gone simultaneously so if you still don’t get a successful post then it’s most likely a GPU issue.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I disconnect one of the GPUs (left it seated on the motherboard because it is bolted in there and I forgot a screwdrivel  :rolleyes:  ) and get this shrill tone, so I shut it down, plug it back in and retry. Starts right up perfectly…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If one of the GPU’s is still plugged into the PCI slot but not powered it could cause issues in the boot process. Even more so if it’s in the default slot on the motherboard. I suggest completely removing the card you believe you know is faulty before trying the RAM test above. Yes that means you need to find a screwdriver  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> !</p>
<p>You may have said so before but is there anyway you can borrow a known working GPU from someone? Doesn’t matter if it’s inferior we just want to see if it boots properly with a verified working card.</p>
<p>I also second what Jeannotvb said about verifying CAS timings.</p>
<p>EDIT 1 - Your computer’s rebooted twice of it’s own accord from windows or did you reboot it?</p>
<p>If you can get into windows try turning off automatic restart on system failure (right click “My computer” or Computer &gt; properties &gt; advanced &gt; start up and recovery, untick the box that says automatically restart). Note the code down you receive when it BSOD’s and post it up here.</p>
<p>EDIT 2 - Just looking through the motherboard manual and noted section 3.3.2 regarding the dual/single gpu card configuration. You need to make sure that’s set correctly if you have a single card, it may even be the reason behind the beep. If you hear that beep again you need to note the sequence of beeps.</p>
<p>If you can boot now running memtest86+ for a while (1 hour at least) is a good idea. It’s on the <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ubuntu live cd</a> if you have facility to burn it it’s a good tool to have.</p>
