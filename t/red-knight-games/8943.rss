    <description>Hey guys, the last few months I&#39;ve been working with some friends to try and start up a small indie company based here in Sydney. We&#39;re called Red Knight Games, and our first title is called Grapple Knight, a throwback to the retro arcade platformers of the 90&#39;s. Here&#39;s the site:
[url]https://redknightgames.com/[/url] 
Go to &quot;The Game&quot; page and download the exe to play it at a better resolution. 

Shameless self plug aside, If you&#39;re a fan of old-school platformers (not sure how many there are on these boards) you should play our current demo and leave some feedback, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it!
If you want to follow our development we have all the usual social media crap

Cheers guys!  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Ok so I played through it here are my thoughts.</p>
<p>-It’d be nice if up arrow also jumped.  I feel like it would make grappling diagonal after jumping feel a lot more smooth.</p>
<p>-This is probably just because you haven’t implemented it yet, but it could use a delay between when you die and respawn so you can stop press whatever button you were when you died. I found on the diagonal grapple jump with the spike pit beneath it if i died, I’d die again immediately. because naturally you don’t think to let go of the input right away.</p>
<p>-Depending on which way you are facing the arm magically changes which arm has the armor.<br>

<p>-The backgrounds are nice enough for a fairly common environment type.  The main character design is interesting to an extent.  But I feel like as it stands screen caps of this probably wouldn’t stand out amongst a lot of other 2d side scrollers.</p>
<p>-The way the foreground trees’ faces turn to face you is pretty neat, I hope to see more little touches like that in the environment.</p>
<p>-As far as gameplay is concerned I can’t really say too much because its so early but it was fun for a tutorial level.</p>

            <p>It’s similar, it’s supposed to be an Ibis that spits acid globs at you, haha. The enemies are going to be encountering are animals that have been merged with other animals, so those birds attacking you are vampire chickens.</p>

            <p>The controls are still very much WIP at this point, so it will inevitably change in a few months time, until we find something that feels just right. You’re right about wall scaling, I think we’re changing it so you can jump off the wall you are facing and grapple in mid-air towards the opposite wall. But yeah, thanks for playing and for your feedback man.</p>

            <p>Seems like a pretty good base so far and the art style is nice. The controls are decent but need some tweaking, specially the grapple mechanics need less delay between uses. That part where you need to scale the wall using the grapple can be a bit frustrating because pressing down to cancel the grapple does not work well. It would be better if pressing the grapple key again cancelled it and launched it again at the same time, combined with almost no delay between uses, it would make using the grapple a lot more fun.</p>

            <p>Oh, that’s just the end of the prototype level, should have mentioned that sorry. I should also probably mention this is a very early version of the game, so it ain’t perfect yet! But yeah, mouse aim is something we will take in to consideration as an alternate control scheme. It’s also possible to play with a controller. What were your thoughts besides that?</p>

            <p>So I just played the game and reached a part where I have to jump down to a pit full of birds and after killing them all I seem to be stuck.</p>
<p>Is the game supposed to do that or am I doing something wrong? Also, the grapple mechanic would be much better with mouse aim.</p>
