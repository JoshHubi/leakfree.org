    <description>This might be irrelevant; but Valve recently implemented SteamPipe in TF2. [url]https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7388-QPFN-2491[/url]
According to the FAQ, SteamPipe does not use .GCF files. Instead, content is packed up into VPK files, which are similar to .zip files. VPK files are used by other Valve games such as DOTA2, CS:GO, and Left4Dead 2. VPK files are also used on the dedicated server.
My question is whether Black Mesa will be affected by the new changes.</description>

<p>Would this perhaps improve load times</p>

</aside>
<p>Yep. In fact, the FAQ for SteamPipe says that load times would be reduced. :freeman:</p>

            <p>Hopefully BM will have a Steam Workshop section, so you’d just have to subscribe to a mod and it’d install automatically.</p>

            <p>I’m not positive, but I think this might allow BM to work somewhat like WON HL’s mod loader. Obviously not in the same way as far as the back end is concerned, but if addons are structured the right way, the experience would be about the same for the user.<br>
[b]&gt; Install Mod</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open BM<br>
Modloader/Addons menu option<br>
Select Mod<br>
Activate<br>
Mod files override BM files: Menu changes over<br>
Play Mod<br>
Deactivate when done to play BM some more.[/b]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which of course, if it works this way, will make BM be what HL was for the modding community about ten years ago; A massive opportunity.</p>

            <p>shitting fuck</p>
<p>I wonde rif the classic folder drop method will still work? I’m dumb and never bothered learning to do VPKs. So used to being able to blend mods together without repacking them</p>
<p>guess it’s no different than the system skyrim or fallout uses</p>

<p>Just a heads up that we are working on a similar file/mod setup which valve is using on the new tf2 beta update.</p>

<p>TextFAMGUY1 will be able to distribute his work in a VPK and allow users to simply drop it in a specific folder then play it away!</p>
