    <title>Detail-Sprite shadowing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/detail-sprite-shadowing/14469</link>
    <description>Hello guys.
I&#39;m currently working on my next multiplayer map and I want to add some cool vegetation. For the vegetation to get shadowed correctly I tried out prop_static, prop_detail and prop_dynamic. But the models appear fullbright in game all the time.
How can I use correctly lit grass-models and detail sprites in source engine?

So far it doesn&#39;t work for the following models:
models/props_foliage/detail_plant01.mdl
models/props_foliage/detail_shrub03.mdl
models/props_foliage/detail_shrub05.mdl
models/props_foliage/detail_plant02.mdl


Help pls  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Unfortunately, with those models, you can’t - It’s a limitation of the detail prop system. All models and sprites to be used in the system (primarily for auto-placement on specific displacement types, but they can be hand-placed as you’ve been doing) have to use the UnlitGeneric shader, which means they can’t <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> be fullbright. (I’m under the assumption that this was done because most detail models are very low-poly, down to 2 tris, so so Valve opted to disallow vertex lighting)</p>
<p>Any foliage prop with detail in the name is used by that system, so short of making a copy of the model and material without the unlit shader, there’s not really a way to use lighting on them.<br>
Luckily the larger shrubs are designed for prop_static!</p>
<p>EDIT: Just found this on the Developer wiki-</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Valve Developer Community">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Valve Developer Community:</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> Tip:</span>To allow <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VertexLitGeneric" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">VertexLitGeneric</a> models, open game\client\detailobjectsystem.cpp and remove the conditional block from CDetailObjectSystem::UnserializeModelDict().</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So support for vertexlitgeneric can be coded in fairly easily. Might be something we should ask the devs to do for the next update.</p>
