    <description>The Dark Mod, a Doom 3 mod that is heavily inspired by the Thief series, released a very impressive patch today!

I&#39;m pretty new to the thief series myself, been playing the first one recently. I was thinking to myself while playing it the other night, &quot;this needs a BM style remake&quot;, and stumbled across this while reading Rock Paper Shotgun. While it&#39;s not a 1:1 remake of Thief due to copyright issues, the gameplay and setting are very, very similar. They&#39;re working on a standalone version that won&#39;t require Doom 3, but if you do own D3 and enjoy stealth games, check this one out!</description>

            <p>That’s a great breakdown of Assassins. Really excellent level.</p>
<p>Also, got my PC all back up and running, so downloading TDM 1.08 now. Gotta find something to tear me away from Dishonored.</p>

            <p>Not really related to TDM, but an interesting analysis of one of my favorite Thief 1 levels:</p>

<p>Related to the dark mod, I knocked her on the head, but I don’t think she survived the fall:</p>

            <p>I played the included mission “The tears of St Lucia” and it was very enjoyable. I think it bugged out on me because one of the objectives was to steal at least 1000 in valuables which I did, but it didn’t register for some reason. So I couldn’t finish the mission. But overall it was very good, amazing to think this is running on the same engine as Doom 3. Will try out some other missions soon.</p>

            <p>Been playing the new fan mission “In the North” by grayman, it’s good fun.</p>
<p>I’m enjoying the changes to the AI, much more realistic reactions and perception, as opposed to earlier versions with the whole “Oh, I see a tiny spec moving in the light in the far distance? It <span class="bbcode-i">must</span> be an intruder here to steal our riches!” or making one mistake and having them instantly attack you.</p>

            <p>Definitely gonna give this a shot as soon as my gaming PC is back up and running. I love the Dark Mod, but it had some big issues last time I played that seem to be mostly cleared up now.</p>

            <p>Already got it, TDM is one of my favorite mods ever. Thief is such an awesome series, I’m glad they are trying to give the mod scene for it something newer to work with then the Dark engine.</p>
