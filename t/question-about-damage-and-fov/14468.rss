    <title>Question about damage and FoV</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/question-about-damage-and-fov/14468</link>
    <description>I was wondering if the ability to either increase or increase the damage value for a weapon is still in the game.
The 2012 version of the mod used the standard Source command &quot;sk_plr_dmg_(weapon) x,&quot; and it allowed for me to increase my gaming experience, or simply dick around whenever I was bored.
However, I recently noticed that this command is unavailable. Is there any way to replicate the effects of sk_plr_dmg in the newest version of the mod?
Additionally, it seems I can no longer change my FoV.
Will these be added in a future update, or is this something I&#39;m going to have to do manually? If so, please help!

Thanks.</description>

            <p>Bump. No alternate way to change viewmodel fov? I don’t mind waiting for official support. Just seeing if it’s possible right now.</p>

            <p>You can change your FoV with the console command fov_desired. We made it so it can be turned up to 120.</p>
<p>The damage variables are now kept in the weapon file .dmxs, which are in scripts/gameplay/weapons, which you have to extract from the game’s VPKs. This is a more efficient way of storing the information, and prevents tampering for MP. But you can edit them freely as they are just text files.</p>
