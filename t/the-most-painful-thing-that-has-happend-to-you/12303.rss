            <p>This one time I got a rock lodged about one centimetre into my eyebrow. I was lucky it didn’t hit just slightly lower or I would’ve been blind on my right eye.</p>
<p>Not sure if that was the most painful, though, but it’s the only occurrence I can remember.</p>

<p>Yeah all those idiots wearing protective gear are so dumb. Everyone knows you shouldn’t wear protective gear until you have a painful experience!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Albeit I’ve had a few knocks here and there, and bless my snowboarding helmets I’ve had some crashes I KNOW would have caved my skull in on more then one occasion without.</p>
<p>When I was younger I fell off my bike on the way to a video rental shop and smashed the back right of my head on concrete with nice grippy sharp stones pointing out of it, woke up 30 minutes later feeling a little dizzy and continued to walk with my bike about 100 yards then decided to turn around and head home, sat down had my step mother dabbing blood off my hair and head I was unaware of, all of a sudden felt sick, ran to the toilet, threw up all over the wall and door before I made it in then decided it was probably time to go to hospital.</p>
<p>Once in hospital I got priority, apparently head injuries get priority, got cleaned up, hospital dressed and a nice little room with a hook up, felt okay at this point.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the next morning, still felt okay till the second I got out of bed and stood on my feet had a migraine shoot through my head and had to walk slowly as each step came with a pulsing head pain, took about 3-4 days to heal.</p>
<p>People who wear protective equipment during sports aren’t the smart ones, they’ve just wised up after having previous accidents, I don’t want another head injury.</p>
<p>Edit, I’ve also fell a story through a corrugated asbestos roof, natural reflex had me grab the ledge as I fell and sliced three gouges into my arm, probably should have cleaned it, worst part was half a meter next to me was old rusted jagged sharp farming machinery pointing up, I was half a meter from being impaled. (done much more but I’ll stop here.)</p>

            <p>Pretty much the most painful thing that ever happened to me was when I was scratching inside my ear and I nicked something exactly the wrong way. Cheese and rice, I was whining on the couch for hours. Then there was the time recently that I was opening a can of cat food and I yanked it open and… slice. At least two-millimeter gash in my thumb.</p>
<p>I lose though.</p>

            <p>I want to post something in this thread, but I can’t remember the pain, only the injuries.</p>
<p>We used to have a huge swing set when I was younger. I don’t think they’re allowed to be that big anymore, not sure it was allowed even then. Pretty sure I remember my parents telling me that, or maybe it’s the way it was constructed that isn’t allowed anymore.  Four big, long square pieces of wood put together as two 'X’s so they form a crotch up top where another piece was fitted between them to attached the swings to.<br>
The swings were hanging above dirt, not sand, old fashion dirt, and roots.<br>
Me and my siblings used to dare each other to lean as far back as possible when swinging, even went as far as hanging by the knee. I went a little bit too far down and struck my lower backs on the roots, skinning it. There’s now a scar covering my spine.</p>
<p>I was also bitten by an adder once around the age of 4-5, nearly died. There was never no pain, had been bitten when we went swimming at that forest lake, didn’t noticed it before we were back at my grandmother’s house.<br>
Was picked up by an ambulance, though I don’t remember. I’m not even remembering my grandmother slapping my face to keep me conscious, I’ve been told it wasn’t any easy slaps either.</p>

            <p>When I was little I was running through the forest and ran face-first into a lone strand of barbed wire. I’ve got a small scar beside my left eye from that.</p>

            <p>Sometimes when I’m really into a drawing I’m working on, I’ll go like 16 hours without food or sleep without even realizing. A few years ago during one of these trips I got up to pee. The biggest issue with sitting down for that long is definitely blood flow, and in the middle of my journey to the bathroom I froze with vertigo and collapsed head-first into the corner of a freshly sharpened coffee table</p>

<p>I suppose I should have mentioned the pain was excruciating, I couldn’t breathe very well for a good 3 minutes after the fall. Luckily I was practically unscathed otherwise.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>One thing I’d like to add about my incident with the wire in the car is that the doctors had told my parents that, if the wire had been even a half a millimeter closer to my eye, I would’ve lost my eye.  So.  Yeah.</p>

            <p>Speaking of falls, I fell on my head and got a mild concussion when I was a wee youngster. I learned to not play in the back of my dad’s truck after that brush with death.</p>
<p>And then I almost drowned in my aunt’s pool. Twice.</p>

            <p>Oh and then there was that time I narrowly avoided death after I crashed through the drywall in the roof… 6’ fall on your back isn’t something to laugh at. IF I had reoriented a few degrees to the left or the right, I’d be permanently paralyzed if not dead atm…</p>

            <p>I fell from a 1 story height and landed on my back, luckily the damage wasn’t much but the pain lasted me for a month.</p>
<p>Back in the middle school, I have this jaw issue where I couldn’t open it fully, when I do it hurt and have a loud snapping noise when I force it open. It was really annoying especially when I try to eat.</p>
