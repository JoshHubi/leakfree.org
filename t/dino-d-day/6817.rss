    <title>Dino D-Day</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dino-d-day/6817</link>
    <description>Has anyone else noticed that Dino D-Day is on sale for pre-order for $18 on Steam. The reason I&#39;m bringing this up is because Dino D-Day is a HL2 mod that is available for download off of Desura for free. This just got me thinking that if Dino D-Day can be put on Steam for distribution than maybe Black Mesa can too.

<p>No, the main difference is that Black Mesa is using someone else’s intellectual property.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/bulb.png?v=9" title=":bulb:" class="emoji" alt=":bulb:"></p>

            <p>Thanks for the info because now it makes sense . I figured it was the same mod I played for free. I never meant to imply Black Mesa could be sold on Steam because of the obviouse intulectual rights issue I just thought that it might be possible to download it from steam for free once its released. Since Dino D-Day bought the Source rights however it look like they paid for their distrabution rights however and this thread its pointless and means nothing for BM.</p>

            <p>You could, of course, take out every reference to Half-Life, rename everything, and title it “Balck Meas”, which may or may not have been the original intention of that particular sister mod.</p>

            <p>Yeah, these guys bought a license; the “mod” was just a test.</p>
<p>Now the real question: is this going to be any better than the demo? Because that was pretty disappointing.</p>
