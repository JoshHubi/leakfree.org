    <title>CRASH: Blast Pit, the &quot;big fan&quot; area</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-blast-pit-the-big-fan-area/10076</link>
    <description>After activating the &quot;big fan&quot; in Blast Pit from just beneath it, I tired to step on one of those metal structures that connect the center of the shaft with the round wall: as a result, the game crashed.

What puzzles me is that when I reloaded and tried to do that once more, to &quot;test&quot; it, it didn&#39;t happen again, neither with the fan off nor after activating it.

Probably it&#39;s not such a big deal, but I thought you guys would check it out anyway. Maybe the minidump (attached) will be of some help.

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Please forgive my bad english! I fixed it… run, the task manager, after launch the game, jump to the task: hl2.exe, right clik, set affinity, and enable 1 or maximum 2 cores.</p>

<p>That actually just worked and I can continue my game.</p>

            <p>I fixed it by destroying a box in the fan, it could be any other loose debris aswell.<br>
To do so, enable the console (Esc.setting&gt;keyboard&gt;advanced settings (it’s across the bottom of the small settings windows)&gt;enable developer console.<br>
Then type in:<br>
“Sv_cheats 1<br>
noclip” (no quotes)</p>
<p>Now destroy/ move debris then no clip your way back to the lever then dis-able noclip by simply typing in “noclip” in the developer console again.<br>
And know it seems so obscured that debris in a fan can crash a game but it worked for me.<br>
Good Luck  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>My game is always crashing at this point. Tried restarting the game, the pc and even changing process priority (which was a fix for others but not for me).</p>
<p>Is this going to be fixed? A lot of ppl seem to have it…</p>

            <p>I vaguely remember a similar issue and solution to something in Half-Life 2 or one of the episodes. I think its a Source vs certain hardware issue.</p>

            <p>Yeah I just encountered the same problem - I can also confirm that it’s to do with debris or objects that fall onto the fan before you switch it on.</p>

            <p>Same problem.  Game would crash shortly after fan was started. I reloaded the autosave and tried not to throw anything down.  It worked.</p>

            <p>Same problem here. I did however have the urge to push a canister off the edge at the top. I’ll try reload further back and not do that, to see if something colliding with the fan is causing the crash.</p>

<p>Same problem here. Hopefully there is a fix to this. I only downloaded 2/3 of the downloads “needed” to play this game. I thought that that was the problem, so I went to download it again. It brought me to a 404 error page. Can someone else tell me if they only downloaded 2/3 of the folders?</p>
