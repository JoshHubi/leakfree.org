    <title>Fallout 3?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fallout-3/1976</link>
    <description>I just started playing Fallout 3 last friday, it kinda sucked me in. Came nowhere as close as the Half-life Universe, but still it&#39;s a pretty formidable game. What do you people that have played it think? Any opinions, memories, good mods? Just wondering what other people think about it.</description>

            <p>I never (well…) got any problem about multiposting before. I would edit my post now, but there is no “delete” option.</p>
<p>About console vs PC versions. Well yeah, consoles have dlc, but you have to pay for it (which is stupid, but standard marketing). With PC you have many free mods.</p>

            <p>I got Fallout 3 exactly 7 days ago, and have already beaten it 3 times, I bought the GOTY edition over Steam to replace the torrented version I had and have had a very enjoyable time playing it. You did ask about mods and thus I have to warn you, be careful if you use a custom race. If you do, and apply the race before you begin Broken Steel you will run into a glitch that prevents Broken Steel from loading. There is another problem that you might run into involving Scribe Rothchild and his bloody map, but I have yet to discover if that is caused by mods, or the game itself, (I have also yet to discover a fix for it). It is an amazing game, with quite a few good mods out there. My personal favorite is this one&gt; <a href="https://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5666" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5666</a>. Excellent retexture of the Chinese Stealth Armor.<br>
Other then those two glitches, it has been an amazing game for me. Have fun.</p>
<p>Edit: I did not see you post information about what distribution method you purchased the game over, as such, if you purchased a physical copy, you should get the FOSE, or Fallout Script Extender. It opens up a plethora of fun mods for you.</p>

<pre><code>It was the least fun out of all the DLC but you also get the best armor in the game after you finish it. (Winterized TB-51 and the Chinese Stealth armor)  As well as the Gauss rifle (Which is alright, I just like how it knocks the toughest enemies on their ass really. The Victory Rifle does too though I suppose.)

<p>Fallout: New Vegas is an upcoming game announced by Bethesda Softworks on April 20, 2009 at its London showcase. While New Vegas is not a direct sequel, it will be in the same style as Fallout 3 and will be developed by Obsidian Entertainment, a company founded by some of the developers of Fallout and Fallout 2. Based on the title, it will be set in Las Vegas. It has a projected release date of 2010 and will be available on the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.  “Fallout Wiki” <a href="https://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout:_New_Vegas" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Portal:Fallout:_New_Vegas</a></p>

<p>I feel like the only person in the world who really didn’t like Fallout 3. As in, not even just average like Halo, but below average. Maybe I just played it right after I had gotten completely bored of Oblivion (After about 150 hours), and it just was too samey. Oh well. Gun play still sucks.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I got through Oblivion vanilla, then again with all the mods I could fit in my computer and I (obviously) loved Oblivion. Then right after that I downloaded Fallout 3 and went through it with a constant sense of deception. I was … angry… at Bethesda, and pissed of everybody praising its “greatness”. It only seemed like a cheap guns version of Oblivion to me. (I also tried Morrowind, but being young and superficial, I couldn’t go over the fact that its graphics are old and the gameplay is plain bad)</p>
<p>Then about a month ago I bought it for PS3. I’m not saying it’s better on PS3, but this time I really got into it. I think that I was just too obsessed with oblivion to appreciate Fallout 3 …</p>

<p>No way its going to make its release date of June. A game as popular as Fallout would almost certainly get its pseudo-sequel overhyped long before its release.</p>

<p>yea and don’t quote me on this or anything but I think the original developers are doin this one. Have to check my resources again to make sure…</p>
<p>Edit: No I was wrong. Some company called the Obsidian Entertainment. I just assumed cause it was different that it was the original developers.</p>
