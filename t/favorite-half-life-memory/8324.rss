    <title>Favorite Half-Life Memory</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/favorite-half-life-memory/8324</link>
    <description>What&#39;s your favorite Half-Life memory?  I have to say, I&#39;ve got many.  But My top three are:

The tram ride in:  as boring as it is, the ambient music and the atmosphere the game presents to you really immerse you into the game.  I heard that was actually the intention from Valve as well.

The Test Chamber: Of course I have to say this one.  Its just really amazing with all of the sounds the AMS makes and then when the resonance cascade happens... Wow...  Then you wake up to see the facility destroyed.  Probably one of the must memorable scenes in video game history.

Getting the Tau Canon/Gauss Gun: Questionable Ethics IS my favorite chapter.  But that moment when the room explodes and you find that weapon sitting on the floor.  Then when the music kicks in and you go running down the hallway killing everything in sight with one of the most dangerous weapons in the game.  Hearing the [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkdZUW_vuf0&amp;context=C30b91d2ADOEgsToPDskIypAMsERpdqrhuiCurmSof&#39;]audio from that scene in BMS[/url] only got me excited to play QE and the rest of the game again. 

Oh, and I was bored so I made this.  Not the best box art out there but I think it&#39;s pretty nice.  Especially since its my first one  :stuck_out_tongue:

            <p>I remember the Tram ride and the test chamber from when I was like 4 or 5 years old. Half life was the first video game I had everseen, and my god, was the game amazing to me. Video games were an amazing concept for my young mind. And the game looked very realistic.</p>
<p>Ten to Eleven years later, I got to relive those memories when I got the game on Steam. Played it over summer, and God, was there so much nostalgia .</p>
<p>Also, I was playing on Hard, when I got to some Blast doors.I ran up to them, trying to open them with E. An Alien Grunt did, and oh my god, did I scream like a girl. I shot it, and blasted it with some grenades, and just as I thought I was going to kill it, <span class="bbcode-i">Another</span> freaking Grunt spawned behind me. So, instead of trying to finish off the first alien grunt, I started taking out the other one.</p>
<p>God, did my hands shake after that. Half life has been the only game that has scared me like hell.</p>

            <p>My memory of Half-Life… was when I first played it. That tram ride was SO memorable. And then the whole teleportation experiment in Anomalous Materials. I was pretty excited when I got the MP5 I have to admit… I never expected to see an MP5. Before you say I’m a COD fanboy… I’m not, so get that out of your head.</p>

            <p>I think the most memorable scene from my first play through of Half-Life must be the Resonance Cascade.</p>
<p>I remember shoving the carrier into the analysis port and then seeing the green electricity.  My first thought was, “Oh shit!  Did I push it in wrong?”</p>
<p>“Gordon!  Get away from the beam!”</p>
<p>I started running, thinking I had to avoid the beams and get out of the test chamber before something happened and I died, having to start over.  I couldn’t open the door so I ran up to the ladder.  I was genuinely panicking.  I started to ascend the ladder as fast as I could when suddenly the screen went black.  The breathing!  The heartbeats!</p>
<p>Oh god, that was great.  I had chills.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I still remember how I felt during the scene where you could hear Gordon breathing but the screen was black.</p>

            <p>Probably tram ride. Mostly because I’d seen videos of Half-Life, and heard plenty of good things about it, along with watching Freeman’s Mind several dozen times, finally experiencing it for myself was amazing.</p>

            <p>Theres walking into and around Anamolous Materials and the entire experiment.</p>
<p>Then there is getting to the surface for the first time and having soldiers dropping in from everywhere completely intent on killing you, then escaping them.</p>
<p>Every boss is memorable, and all had their own sense of fear. Running from the Garg to turn on the power still gets the heart racing today.</p>
<p>Getting captured and thrown into a garbage compactor, awesome.</p>
<p>Questionable ethics and the entire surface tension chapter, the pinacle of HL1 I think.</p>
<p>Then exploring the Lambda complex, awesome map design everywhere. Then of course going over to the other side and the awe when you get there.</p>
<p>Then the Nihilanth, epic battle.</p>
<p>Then the Gman speech, probably the best monologue in gaming.</p>
<p>Half-Life and Deus Ex are my favourite games ever. I could literally walk you through both games blindfolded.</p>

            <p>I have a lot of favorite memories in Half Life.  This is when you come to a part of the game and say to yourself, “Oh…… I love this part”.  But I think Surface Tension has most of them.   And you’re right, the music plays a big part in the memories.</p>

            <p>My best Half-Life memory was that moment when I walked out of Black Mesa Research Facility and saw the jets fly by. This video game moment is only rivaled by the part in Fallout 3 where you walk out of the Vault, and your eyes flare to adjust to the sun.</p>

            <p>For me there are many as well, but there is one that sticks out in my mind.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the game measures your proximity to the NPCs and that triggers a reaction based on what NPC it is and how close you are. ie: arms length from a scientist and they will speak to you, line of sight for an HECU and they shoot.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game after the Resonance cascade and you begin your fight out, there’s that elevator that fails and kills those scientists…</p>
<p>Well, during one of my play throughs, when I got into the elevator shaft I was close enough to the elevator to trigger a proximity reaction of one of the scientists. He greeted me with “Oh, Hello” …as he plummeted to his death.</p>

            <p>I remember how excited I was about going to Xen after on the first couple of tries the scientist operating the portal device died.</p>
<p>Then I remember being somewhat disappointed and actually lost some interest by the time I got to Interlooper. Glad Xen is being reworked.</p>

            <p>It has been a loooong time since I played (been holding out for the BM) but I think I remember running round a load of pipes at one point (possibly just before surface tension) and the music kicked in all rock style.  Made me feel cool.  Therein lies the memory.</p>
<p>Oh and the fan, in the blast pit.  That’s not a good memory.  Put the game down for a month after my 15th attempt to get through the fan.  Funny now I come to think of it, the first time I picked up the game again I went straight through.</p>
