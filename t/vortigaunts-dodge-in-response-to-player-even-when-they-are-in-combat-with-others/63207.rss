    <title>Vortigaunts dodge in response to player even when they are in combat with others</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vortigaunts-dodge-in-response-to-player-even-when-they-are-in-combat-with-others/63207</link>
    <description>So vortigaunts now dodge in response to the player aiming over them, a feature from the Xen update pasted onto all vortigaunts in the Black Mesa facility. However, these vortigaunts are also often in combat with HECU. 

In Surface Tension, there are some massive fights in which the player can even choose not to participate. In those fights, I can be far away from the action, probably not even visible to a combatant, but still the vortigaunts dodge in response to MY aim even though they don&#39;t even acknowledge my presence, instead of in response to the HECU units they&#39;re fighting.

This is a minor bug and hardly noticeable, but because I had read the patch notes I could not stop noticing it.</description>
