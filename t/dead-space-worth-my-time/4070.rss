    <title>Dead Space: Worth my time?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dead-space-worth-my-time/4070</link>
    <description>Considering getting Dead Space in a week or so. Just need some opinions on whethers it&#39;s worth it or not. I&#39;ve got a secondary choice of ARMA II, but if you have any other suggestions add them.

And a few don&#39;ts:


* L4D 1 or 2
* any fantasy RPG
* Just Cause 2
* Metro 2033</description>

            <p>You could get this game, and play it on an HD projector alone at 3 in the morning with loud surround sound. Of course, you would scare yourself so much that the only thing you can do is keep playing (you cant go to sleep) and get stuck in an endless loop.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well, finished the bastard over the weekend. Once again my sentiment is the same in that it didn’t deliver in all areas. The game proved definitely creepy. The crew quarters? I knew that’d be bad but holy shit that voice whispering “Twinkle twinkle Little Star” in the lobby full of bodies made me extremely paranoid. Unfortunately nothing afterwards delivered with this kind of tension, and I found that no enemy induced any kind of paralysing fear. In fact after launching the executive shuttle most encounters felt little more than a combat fest shoot em up.</p>
<p>However, while not quite delivering on the atmosphere I expected the story does keep you captivated until the end. The constant piecing together of what happened, as well as the brief encounters with both Unitologist doctors keeps you engaged with the story of the Marker; leaving the twist that it is in fact a man made copy all the more delicious. I was kind of let down by the lack of crew members though; apart from the two scientists and a few crazed shipmates everyone appeared to have died, even the engineer Temple, who I gained a strange bond with through his audio logs and ended up being saddened by a lack of closure. Obviously you’re meant to presume that he was killed in the shuttle bay, but was it not possible to leave a recogniseable corpse with his final log somewhere nearby? On characters I must say that Nicole annoyed me. It was painfully obvious that she wasn’t genuine, her mannerisms and reports of similar apparitions being a dead giveaway. The effect was that I felt like I was guiding an idiot around as he dragged the Marker to the altar in the final chapter.</p>
<p>All in all though it is a solid game with satisfactory gameplay, excellent story and great setting. Really could have benefitted with more fear generation though; perhaps the developers should take a look at titles such as FEAR, STALKER or Silent Hill?</p>
<p>Plenty of highlights throughout:</p>
<p>Temple, as I said, was an interesting if unseen character.</p>
<p>The Marine ship was a brilliant twist, multiplied by the appearance of the super fast Twitchers!</p>
<p>Mercer was a fine nemesis, and while his self sacrifice left me somewhat cheated of dealing with him myself, it seemed a fitting end to his insanity.</p>
<p>Dying in some cases was oddly hilarious, my favourite being completely obliterated by an asteroid or sliced clean in half by those blades around the ore sample.</p>
<p>Daniel’s betrayal was both surprising and unexpected. On the one hand she seemed like a person who’d do that, on the other there was never any hint at why she would do so. Her death was one of the most shocking and brutal I’d ever seen as well.</p>
<p>The final battle with the Hivemind was something that I loved. Although it seemed a bit easy, I couldn’t help but feel great satisfaction in killing something the height of a small tower.</p>
<p>And of course, the stinger at the end. I fucking knew there’d be one! Nonetheless I shat my pants when Nicole leapt out at the screen, prompting me to cast some nervous glances around the room as the credits rolled.</p>

<p>I also found the laboratory full of babies nightmarish; the occasional infant cry proving just as unnerving as the soft whispering in the morgue.</p>

<p>If you think that’s creepy, wait until chapter 10 or watch the attract video that plays if you leave the main menu idle for a couple of minutes and listen.</p>
<p>I love Dead Space, it’s the first game I’ve played that has ever truly had me completely on edge throughout the entire thing. Normal was scary enough, hard was frightening, and impossible was shit your pants terror, even with the buffed up tank suit, dying was extraordinarily easy. Great use of atmosphere, great characters, great cast, great story, great enemies, great game. Can’t wait until 2 comes out (later this year hopefully).</p>
<p><span class="mention">@ThatOneGuy</span>: BLACK-TEXT SPOILER ALERT! [COLOR=‘Black’]You can see Issac’s face right at the beginning of the game. After the Kellion crashes, but <span class="bbcode-i">before</span> Issac puts his helmet on (obviously), you can rotate the camera fully around him to look behind. Voila!</p>

<p>I don’t want to ruin anything for you, but I finished Dead Space just yesterday and all I can say is that you will find that the story gets progressively more complicated.  I liked it.</p>
<p>[Spoiler following in black for those that have finished it]<br>
[COLOR=‘black’]Did anyone else like how you don’t see Issac’s face until the end; when he takes off his helmet, and you can see (or imagine seeing) the weight of what has happened on his face?  I thought that was a nice touch.</p>
<p>Man, I hope I did that coloring correctly.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hey guys, I was looking the Facebook page for Dead Space 2 and look what I found:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
Yup, this confirms it.  Dead Space 2 will be awesome.</p>

            <p>i like this game although i didn’t have time to finish it when i rented it, it’s pretty cool. its mad scary in the beginning before you figure out the AI can’t walk thru doors and realize that every corpse turns into a monster and learn to predict where battles are going to happen.  i believe the sequel will be dope.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well, played up to Chapter 4, I think? I’m in the engine section, just turned on the centrifuge.</p>
<p>So far it’s kind of failing to live up to expectations. A lot of the environs feel like Quake 4 all over again, although the zero G and vacuum areas are quite trippy. Visuals overall however are quite good and the Ishimura is starting to take a life of its own.</p>
<p>However my main gripe is the predictabilty so far. I run into an alien corpse that I haven’t killed yet, and of course it jumps to life just as I slice its head off. Walk into a well lit laboratory with intact ventilation hatches, of course the lights will fail and a gunfight will ensue. Even the story isn’t surprising, I’m just seeing a standard “crazy guy goes mutant and spreads his infection” plot, so I’m desperately hoping for a twist.</p>
<p>It’s this predictability which makes the game a lot less scary than it should. After playing games like FEAR and STALKER I know that the key to making something scary is using a fuckton of foreshadowing. Dead Space tries to do this, but half-heartedly with the occasional dark corridor, loud noise or simple shadow. It doesn’t put you on edge enough and when the enemy does appear it’s more akin to some soldier rushing out at you than a fear-commanding predator.</p>
<p>That said it isn’t a bad game. The visuals are great, with plenty of little details such as survivor messages, maggot ridden corpses and loose everyday items. The blood decals seem a bit overused though in areas which are mostly devoid of actual bodies.</p>
<p>The whole inventory and store system is very reminiscent of Dino Crisis 2, which is slightly nostalgic but also quite comforting. Even the aiming system is similar, except that melee is actually a feaseable option in this game.</p>
<p>I did encounter mouse problems that were described here, but turning off Vsynch made the pointer respond less laggily. There was also a point at the start where the camera would get into an uncontrollable spin, which I discovered was due to the Z-Axis throttle on my joytstick! After these were sorted out it was fine, however I’ve noticed that the aiming mode camera is quite sluggish. Is this normal? I’m unable to make it any faster, but this is more of an inconvienience than a life threatening control issue.</p>
<p>I’ve had some good moments so far. Just as standard necroforms had become unfrightening and simple enemies to deal with, I run into a swarm of gooey things. A long streak of not dying was broken as they crawled all over me and bit me to death. Oddly enjoyable to be killed by what appeared to be a harmless enemy. There was also a point where I was opening a door, only to see a shadow move across the wall in front of me. After turning around to see nothing there I KNEW it was just a trick, but I went and rechecked the hallway anyway!</p>
<p>Strangley enough the creepiest parts of the game have been the ones with crewmembers in it. Seeing insane people slamming their heads into a wall or cutting their own throats is far more rattling than a random monster dropping from the ceiling. I also found the laboratory full of babies nightmarish; the occasional infant cry proving just as unnerving as the soft whispering in the morgue.</p>
<p>All in all it’s a solid game but not quite up to its reputation. I’m still fairly early in though, so I’ll see if Dead Space can surprise (or scare) me yet.</p>

<p>Go for it. This is an awesome game. I’d say it’s even more awesome than <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span> if I wasn’t such a fan of VALVe’s games. DS has got great visuals, grim atmosphere that actually makes you wonder what you’re gonna find around the next corner, but the cherry on top of the cake in that game is the story. You discover, step by step, all the little events that led the USG Ishimura to the state it is in when Isaac and his team find it. Definitely a game I didn’t feel I had wasted my money on, unlike, say, <span class="bbcode-i">Red Alert 3</span>.</p>

            <p>Dead Space uses a lot of so called “horror” which is nothing more than sudden movements with loud noises to ‘scare’ the player.<br>
Real horror is where the player is actually scared, such as being in a claustrophic dark environment with scary ambient music. Fighting creatures you know almost nothing about (people usually fear what they don’t understand).</p>
<p>A good example of fine horror is the level Ravenholm from Half-Life 2. It has a great dark atmosphere, great ambient noises and music and scary creatures to fight. I remember the first time I heard those screams from fast zombies - now that’s good shit.</p>

<p>The only thing I ever crowbar in HL are things of the headcrab variety, the majority of enemies recieve a hefty dose of lead/laser/explosions.</p>
