    <title>Any fans of MMA / UFC here?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/any-fans-of-mma-ufc-here/5823</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;ve been working on a series of documentaries lately for web-based news channel [b]Whoa!TV[/b] who focus on news and behind-the-scenes access for major fighting events worldwide.

Enough of that though; here&#39;s my first episode for our exclusive look at Karlos Vemola: (You may also recognise the intro music... :wink: )

[b][url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRA7K97bBaE&amp;fmt=37&#39;]Ultimate Fucking Clickage.[/url][/b]

I just wondered what you guys thought of it?  :slight_smile: 

Also, ignore the shitty intro with the girl and the er, shoe. That was made by someone else and I&#39;m currently in the process of making an awesome 3D, animated logo (leading to me being absent from my Wheatley model).  :slight_smile: 

Thanks,

[b]Harry[/b].</description>
