    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glitchiest-games-that-still-work/6014</link>
    <description>Idk if we&#39;ve had a thread like this, I&#39;m not going to check.

Bethesda games like Oblivion, FO3, and FO:NV come to mind, but those glitches are fun, at least to me. Love duping items in Oblivion or using the paint brushes. 

Honestly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve played a ton of glitchy games besides Bethesda ones, but I love them all.

Ok, do us all a favor. STOP MENTIONING STALKER.</description>

<p>Thanks, I was wondering why it was itching so much.</p>
<p>Actually, you said “every GTA game<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">s</span></span>” which doubles your epic failure.</p>

            <p>Driver 1 has serveral glitches:<br>
It’s possible, with invincibility, to get slammed through walls and get stuck inside.</p>
<p>in Miami, you can drive over some bridges in the north part of the city and go flying really spectacularly, bonus points for cop cars slamming into the ground and/or the wall.</p>
<p>In San Fransisco, try having a car chase on the golden gate bridge, cop cars love to go flying over the walls at the end of it.</p>
<p>In LA, you can drive right through a wall and the cops can’t get to you.</p>
<p>In New York, you can get slammed into the wall of a tunnel and break the game, i got stuck there plenty of times. It’s really close to the start of the level too.</p>
<p>And then there’s the training mission…</p>

<p>My favorite was the bypass that allowed you to complete the Challenges without even completing the Challenges. Plug in a second controller, back out and go back in, and you have a custom game masquerading as a Challenge. Easy win, though unfortunately, they “fixed” it in the 360 release. Way to be a kill joy, fellas.</p>

            <p>I learned some important problems in Mario Kart 64, Mario 64, Pokemon, and if you shoot through the wall in the dark in perfect multiplayer mode to kill people then Perfect Dark has some real problems.</p>

            <p>The Synergy mod crashes every time I try to boot it up, maybe if I use something like dxlvl_70 or 60 would that help? Also Fallout 3 or anything Bethesda makes on that engine is going to fail on performance terms (&amp; those emotionless faces too). Almost wrecked my PS3. Halo 3 sucked too, it RRoD’d my old Elite.</p>

<p>Watching the clueless AI try to walk up a quarter pipe that i put in the middle of the walkway, while making a wall, then fall, then respawn on the other side of the wall is priceless</p>

<p>Ah yes, emulation at its finest.</p>
<p>My vote goes to both True Crime games. Though L.A. has less, and it doesn’t lag. As much. I think I’ve fallen into too many invisible holes in L.A. and NYC tends to freeze and it chugs slower than an alcoholic grandmother. Still fun playthroughs regardless.</p>
