    <title>Error - gameinfo.txt doesn&#39;t exist?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/error-gameinfo-txt-doesnt-exist/9606</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, have a slight difficulty running the game, maybe one of you will be able to help  :slight_smile: 

So I installed Source SDK Base 2007 and Black Mesa today, and been playing Black Mesa for several hours now, unfortunately when I exited the game I was unable to run the game again.. The way I was able to run the game the first time was by checking the box to launch game after install.

There wasn’t a .exe where I installed the game, so I pressed Ctrl+Alt+Del to open task manager and right-clicked on hl2 to find the path, it brought me to 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\”My Name”\source sdk base 2007\hl2.exe

When I run hl2.exe  I get an error saying
“Setup file ‘gameinfo.txt’ doesn’t exist in subdirectory ‘hl2’.
Check your –game parameter or VCONFIG setting.”

So I went online, googled ‘hl2 gameinfo.txt download’ and downloaded the text file and placed it in
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\mystinavaleth\source sdk base 2007\hl2

I can now run hl2.exe, it shows the VALVe picture ([url]https://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/1/13686/1766783-valve_logo_the_bald_guy_large.jpg[/url] )
But then it crashes to desktop and gives me an error saying

“Engire Error
Could not load library client”
And places ‘hl2_4104_crash_2012_9_14T23_16_47C0.mdmp’ in my ‘source sdk base 2007’ folder.

Does anyone know what to do? I&#39;ve tried googleing this problem and read through several forums, but no one ever seems to resolve the problem... Currently my only way to play the game is to reinstall the game and pick &#39;launch after install&#39; every single time I want to play. :[

Any help would be most appreciated! ^_^</description>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">PROBLEM SOLVED!</span>[/SIZE] <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So, all over this forum I see people having the same issue as me, and most people say to fix it just restart steam and Black Mesa will show under library… but didn’t seem to work…</p>
<p>So I figured I’d try playing around with restarting steam, I reinstalled Black Mesa, but instead of picking a custom install path (I was installing it on my D drive), I let it install to it’s default path (which was C drive, more specifically C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS )</p>
<p>Once the game was installed to it’s default path, I then restarted steam one more time and opened steam and Black Mesa is now showing under Library (Also make sure that the drop-down box is set to ‘all games’</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">That’s really it, just had to install the game to C drive instead of a custom location, fixed everything…[/SIZE]</span></p>
<p>If you want to make a shortcut for your desktop, rocketdock, etc. Just right-click on your desktop, go to ‘New’, then pick ‘Shortcut’.<br>
When it asks to type the location of the item, put in “ <a>steam://rungameid/13540830642081628378</a> “ without the quotes.</p>
<p>Vuala, you now have a desktop shortcut for Black Mesa that fully works!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
