    <title>Another HL3 taunt by Valve</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/another-hl3-taunt-by-valve/13763</link>
    <description>So a lot of you have probably seen the whole [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/games/SteamWorkshop/announcements/detail/208632365237576574&#39;]Skyrim workshop paid mods deal[/url].

[img]https://media.steampowered.com/steamcommunity/public/images/workshop/Workshop_CommerceAnnounce.jpg[/img]

Look up in the topleft. Lambda Locator, [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=428880958&amp;searchtext=&#39;]a mod by Jimo which is themed off of Half-Life[/url], is listed and, of course, already purchased and installed, when no other mods listed are.
Classic Valve and their constant teasing without actually saying anything.
Not trying to make conspiracies myself mind you, I just saw this and thought it was amusing. If nothing, it&#39;s unlikely to be accidental.</description>

            <p>Every major HL release has been a milestone in FPS gaming, the next one is going to have to be pretty damn innovative to impress today, it would have to include some sort of new way to interact with the characters, maybe oculus style headset, wired gloves, imagine shaking Barney’s hand in the game world xD</p>
