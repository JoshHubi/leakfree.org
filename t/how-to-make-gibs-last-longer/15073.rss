    <title>How to make gibs last longer?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-make-gibs-last-longer/15073</link>
    <description>Hello,

So I bought the game after playing the free mod back in 2013, and I have noticed that since then gibs disappear within a few seconds. which wasn&#39;t the case before. I am talking about gibs that appear after exploding various NPCs and headcrab corpses as well. I understand this was probably done for performance reasons, because the Source engine and game in general might become laggy and not handle too many gibs/ragdolls/props at the same time.

However is there any console command available that can increase the time gibs are displayed? If not, is it possible to add such a command in a future patch? It should not be a terribly hard task to do, because they already lasted longer before. I understand that tampering with these settings puts performance at risk, but it&#39;s a shame to see such a wonderful custom-gib system go to waste when they dissapear within seconds.

I looked around the internet for a solution but the standard Source engine commands do not work. Here is a list of them:

cl_ragdoll_collide 1
g_ragdoll_fadespeed 0 // controls how fast ragdolls fade.  does not works for gibs.
g_ragdoll_lvfadespeed 0
g_ragdoll_maxcount 100
g_ragdoll_important_maxcount 100
ragdoll_sleepaftertime 500

cl_phys_props_enable 1
cl_phys_props_max 128
props_break_max_pieces -1
r_propsmaxdist 1000
violence_agibs 1
violence_hgibs 1

Thanks! I am loving Black Mesa in general.</description>

            <p>Our gibbing system broke entirely upon the port to the retail engine. It was causing a terrible crash that we only uncovered about 2 weeks out from EA release. Our lead programmer busted his goddamn ass rewriting the entire thing from scratch in record time, to fix the game. Still amazes me that he managed to pull it off!</p>
<p>At any rate, that’s the reason why the gibbing system in retail is different to the mod. It’s much better optimised and causes way less problems than the mod had. That’s the reason why the standard/old commands don’t work, they were probably lost in the rewrite. We can look into powering up the system a bit, but if it does at all happen, I imagine it would be after the Xen release.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, I’d laugh if sv_cheats fixed it but unfortunately it didn’t. I am starting to think something was changed internally in the games source code, so no console commands can help. I can only wait for a dev’s answer.</p>
<p>But for you they do not disappear? That’s strange because after a few seconds of the player not looking at them they should fade away for everyone, other people on the internet say the same.</p>

            <p>Hmmm… i never noticed anything disappearing when playing.</p>
<p>But i’ll give it a try, to see if it would work for me.</p>
<p>Try typing “sv_cheats 1” first in the console, maybe it is needed first.</p>
