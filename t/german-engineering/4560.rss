    <title>German Engineering?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/german-engineering/4560</link>
    <description>Is anything made by Germany superior in terms of how its made? e.g. cars, school stationary (pencils, rubbers, sharpener), women ( :stuck_out_tongue: ) etc

My curiosity rose after i watched a special program on the History Channel. The program was saying how the Germans were superior in everything they made in WW2 like: the tanks, submarines, guns, the first produced prototype sleath bomber in ww2 (thankfully it didnt get a chance to be used in the war), the training of the soldiers etc 

It then got me wondering if the Germans [b]still had[/b] the advantage when it came to making high quality, reliable products.</description>

<p>What is your Central-European country then, and why don’t you show us some pics of your women to prove your point? But in the “feminine beauty” thread, and not here. Stop derailing!</p>

            <p>I like the idea of this thread, being a WWII history buff, and I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents.  German engineering is, and was, exceptional.  But there are some very blatant engineering blunders that the Germans let slip during the second world war.  One of the biggest (haha) problems was with the largest tank produced by Germany during the WWII.  The King Tiger, or Tiger II, was plagued by so many problems that the Russians actually couldn’t understand why the Germans would even make it.  More of the tanks were lost due to mechanical problems and lack of fuel than to enemy action.  The steel used in that tank’s armour was of a lack luster quality which led to catastrophic failure in some cases.  It also used an engine that was used in the Tiger I, which was actually too weak for the original Tiger; this meant the King Tiger had a top speed that was incredibly low.  For the price of one overly large and unreliable Konigstigre, Germany could have produced 1 1/2 much more effective Tigers.</p>
