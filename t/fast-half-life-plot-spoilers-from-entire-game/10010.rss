        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Half-Life 1: An scientist is late for work and, because he’s too tired to think about what he’s doing, accidentally blows everything up.  Seeing this, the government offers him a job.<br>
Opposing Force: A group of soldiers miss their instructions and consequently fail to kill many of their targets.   Instead, they amuse themselves by killing worms.  Seeing this, the government gives our hero a time-out.<br>
Blue Shift: An alcoholic college dropout builds a teleporter during a blackout, partially because there’s nothing else to do and partially to show up some scientists who act like assholes towards him.<br>
Half-Life 2: On the first day of his new government job, the scientist from Half-Life 1 gets into a fight with the police.  He then uses religion to justify escalating this fight into a full-out street war.  During his efforts to send a city into complete chaos, he runs people over with a speed boat, cuts dead bodies in half, burns ants with a magnifying glass, and visits a Holocaust museum.  He ends the day by attempting to destroy a large skyscraper full of people, at which point his boss calls him up to congratulate him on a good first day of the job.<br>
Half-Life 2: Episode 1: The scientist from Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 quits his job and gets a girlfriend who is half his age.  They go out on a trip to the countryside, but on their way there they are stuck in traffic for a very long time.<br>
Half-Life 2: Episode 2: In his attempt to be the first person ever to get a lawn gnome into orbit around the Earth, the scientist from the earlier games gets his girlfriend’s father killed.  She cries tears of joy.<br>
Half-Life 2: Lost Coast: The deepest installment of the series yet.  Guilty over the death toll of his shortsighted obsession with launching painted ceramic statues into space, yet secretly ecstatic because his underaged obsession’s happiness regarding her father’s death plays directly into his lust for her, the scientist from earlier games takes a walk, alone, by the sea, to think.  There he hears voices that tell him how his world works, and afterwards everything looks a little nicer to him.</p>
