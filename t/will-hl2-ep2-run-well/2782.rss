    <title>Will Hl2:ep2 run well</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/will-hl2-ep2-run-well/2782</link>
    <description>Sorry if this Topic is to short to have it&#39;s own thread but I didn&#39;t know where else to put it. I have a question.I recently got a new PC and I wanted to know if a 2.7 GHz pc would run HL2:EP2 well even though the recommended specs are 3.0? I figured .3 Ghz wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference but i wanted to make sure before i bought it.The OS is Windows 7 and i have 4GB of RAM and the Graphics card is an NVIDIA GeForce 6150. I doubt the Graphics card would be a problem cuz i ran HL2 alright on my previous pc with a NVIDIA TNT2 or something like that.</description>

            <p>you won’t need a new processor. Worst case scenario, new power supply (PSU).</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure about your PSU, go for the radeon 4670. Best card you can get that doesn’t require additional power cables. It’ll set you back about $65.</p>
<p>If you are sure about your PSU, or can get someone who knows something about power supplies to make you sure, go with a radeon 4850. It should only set you back around $100.</p>
<p>edit: have we established that you have PCIe and not AGP?<br>
edit2: new pc == pcie</p>

            <p>Okay, so to sum up what I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A graphics card with the ability to run E2 well, as I wan’t Portal 2 and Black Mesa.</li>
<li>A graphics card that can run with my current proccessor, or at the very least<br>
Without havindg to spend more than $50 on one, and fit in my PC.</li>
<li>And it costing (excluding a the price of new proccessor if needed) under $100.</li>
</ul>
<p>If anybody knows a card that meets these requirements (if there is one) please tell me as I said before, don’t wanna waste money on something that won’t even work.</p>

            <p>Oh ok. I know opening the case is safe but I wanted to be sure I knew what I was doing, because everytime I get a computer I can never find anything on the internet to help me. Which is why I posted here, so I’d get  quick answers from (some) people with common sense…</p>

            <p>For the Radeon 4670, you don’t even need to plug in a 6/8 pin connector… Atleast I didn’t. That card will match your budget, and should fit your computer. Opening the case is safe, just shut down your machine first, and you can unplug the power cord if you want to be sure. Just look for a PCI-Express slot, that’s all you’ll need. It’s usually black; check google images for some pics.</p>
<p>By the way, OP means ‘original poster’, which would be you  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>But if you upgrade you’d have to do it all at once, because, the video card can’t do all the job by itself :…should upgrade the processor as well</p>

            <p>WAIT the OP says he has an HP.</p>
<p>You NEED TO CHECK that your PSU can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deliver the necessary voltage over the rails for the video card</li>
<li>Has enough wattage to power all of your devices, and then some left over</li>
<li>Has the necessary 6 and/or 8 pin connectors</li>
</ol>
<p>I know I probably said this earlier in the thread, but this is CRUCIAL.</p>

<p>I do not own Bad Company 2. I do actually own this card, I’m running it alongside an Intel Core i5-750. Planning on getting another to run it in Crossfire. Sometimes it slows on Episode 2 when I have AA and AF maxed out + motion blur to ~30 fps, but I use vsync, so I imagine it would be less if I didn’t use vsync. It’s a nice card, seems to do well with overlocking, though I have not personally tried yet.</p>

<p>I recommend the Sapphire Radeon HD 5770<br>
It can run HL2EP2 fine at maxed out settings, 1600x1200</p>
<p>If you’re serious about upgrading your CPU and want the most bang for your buck, get the i5-750…though you might need to replace the motherboard as well.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all the help. Sadly I’m on a really tight budget. For a graphics card I have about $100 to spend, then I need to find one that’ll actually fit my PC… I’m gonna look into all of these, check prices and find out if any will fit in my PC. I have an HP Pavillion p6203w-b, So if anybody happens to have this PC or a similar one, lemme know what you think’ll fit in my PC 'cause I’m not really sure I wanna crack open my PC case and screw it up or waste $100 for something that wont even fit. That happened to me like, 2 computers ago, and I don’t want a repeat of that. Again, thanks for all the help.</p>
<p>Also: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/HP-500GB-p6203w-b/12347231" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.walmart.com/ip/HP-500GB-p6203w-b/12347231</a></p>
<p>that’s the page for my PC if you need a closer look at the specs. (It’s not the best but it was in my budget and could run Half-Life 2 and Gmod without problems so I’m happy)</p>

            <p>I recommend the Sapphire Radeon HD 5770<br>
It can run HL2EP2 fine at maxed out settings, 1600x1200</p>
<p>If you’re serious about upgrading your CPU and want the most bang for your buck, get the i5-750…though you might need to replace the motherboard as well.</p>

            <p>If you want a cheap AMD card I suggest the Radeon HD 5670.</p>

            <p>If you want a cheap graphic card that is decent, maybe try the ATI Radeon 4000 series.</p>

            <p>…The evidence I found supports just the opposite.  With the obvious exception of Crysis, which always runs better on nVidia hardware, the 5870 blows the 295 out of the water, especially considering that its a single-GPU card.</p>

<p>EDIT:  I’ve found some of the benchmarks you are referring to, and in those tests the testers used <span class="bbcode-i">beta</span> drivers for the 5870. Since its release and several consecutive driver updates, performance has improved greatly.</p>

<p>Guys… seriously, dont confuse the poor guy any further.</p>
<p>If you want the best-of-the-best single GPU cards, the Radeon 5870 and 5850 lead the pack by far. I’m sorry to say, but nVidia really fell behind.</p>
<p>If you want nVidia for some reason, the GTX 275 is as good a value as you’re gonna get. Its not as powerful as the GTX 280, which is nVidia’s most powerful single-gpu card, but its pretty damn close at a better value. keep in mind though that the radeon 5870 blows both of these away, <span class="bbcode-b">and even the dual-GPU GTX 295.</span></p>
<p>Simple as that. but keep in mind that the amount of volts your PSU outputs on the rails is as important as the wattage of the power supply. Also make sure that it has the necessary 6 and/or 8 pin connectors, and that your PC has enough room for these cards (they are hella long).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The rest: yes.  This: no.  Granted there’s a little over a hundred dollars difference between them, but the GTX 295 by most all benchmarks outperforms the 5870.</p>

            <p>…yeah, I know. I was just listing the better cards in case the OP wanted to futureproof his PC.</p>
<p>The 9600GT is a pretty decent all-around card. If your limit is $100 you can get a decent 9800GT.</p>
