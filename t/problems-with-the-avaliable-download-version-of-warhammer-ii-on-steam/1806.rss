    <title>Problems with the avaliable download version of warhammer II on Steam</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problems-with-the-avaliable-download-version-of-warhammer-ii-on-steam/1806</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know why, but the game keeps shutting down every time I use the options window.
Instalation was normal. The first time it happened, the main menu was open and all I did is opening the &quot;Options&quot; window. Then, the game closed and a report program from Relic opened. Wrote the report and tried again.
The second time, the &quot;Options&quot; window opened and I went to &quot;grafics&quot; tab. I put everything at minimal or off (my computer doesn&#39;t support the game properly - discovered today). Then, when I clicked the &quot;Apply&quot; changes button, the game closed again. And again, the report program of Relic opened.

I would like to know if the problem is with my computer or with the game.</description>

<p>I would think this is the problem…what are your system specs?</p>
<p>I wouldn’t advise the hassle of a HD reformat unless you think it’s absolutely necessary and as a last-ditch option; backing up in preparation for a reformat and clean OS reinstall can take a while and is a complete pain (if you operate like me and spread stuff across multiple disks)</p>

            <p>reformat your hard-drive, if that don’t work You may want to update some of your components.<br>
I used to get a similar problem with the original Half-life (although my system is suited to those Graphics) it would freeze/crash the game whenever I was swimming.</p>
