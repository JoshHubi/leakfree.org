    <description>I felt this thread was important, so as to keep the chat thread free from lengthy discussion about politics and the opinions therein.

Thoughts? I&#39;m still reading into certain things, so I&#39;ll either edit this with my own opinion, or I&#39;ll post it up later.</description>

            <p>Hmm, Well politics are where a debate does to die. No mater which side you are on when politics get their hand on it well all descution turns into shit flinging. Take climate change, we have had proof of that sense the 80s yet nothing really gets done do to politics.</p>

Hillary Clinton underperformed President Obama’s showing in 2012 by a dramatic margin.<br>
