    <title>Math Counter and npc_turret_ground</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/math-counter-and-npc-turret-ground/15023</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m working on a HL2E2 level and I&#39;m trying to get this puzzle to work. In sum, the player can blast their way into a Combine outpost by overloading a gas main and taking out the outpost&#39;s defense turret to cause a reaction. The entity logic is set up like so:

math counter 1, max value of 3. Gas valve 1, 2, and 3 each Add 1 to the value of this counter. When maxed, a light flips on to signify the gas is overloaded enough.
[spoiler][attach=5155,none,1916][/attach][/spoiler]

math counter 2, designed after the ground turrets in the Overwatch Nexus during &quot;Follow Freeman!&quot; The counter is based around a check to see if the player has tripped a sensor recently to force a check from the turret. If the player trips a sensor, the trigger subtracts 1 to turn off the lasers and enable the turret, as well as opening it&#39;s func_door casing. If the area is clear, it adds 1 from the counter to re-enable the laser grid and shut the floor hatch, disabling the weapon.

[spoiler][attach=5156,none,1928][/attach][/spoiler]

2 major problems with my entity setup-

1. The light on the third button isn&#39;t turning on, which means possibly the counter is not receiving all possible additions.

2. The turret refuses to shoot at me. I&#39;ve tried everything- changing the casing, the logic for tripping the sensor, I even squadded in an enemyfinder in case the turret was having issues seeing the player. Nothing works.

I&#39;ve been slaving away at this logic for several days and it&#39;s getting quite annoying. Is there a way to check my entity logic to ensure all additions are being calculated properly? I saw one bug in the console that I fixed, but it didn&#39;t help the overall issue. Map available on request.

            <p>You can also use ent_messages_draw 1 to visually see the entity outputs that are being sent. Very useful entity debug tool.</p>

            <p>Small useless note:<br>
If you double click (or drag) the manifest window on your right, you can kill it with the x button on it. Gives you a little bit more of screen space.</p>

            <p>If you pop the VMF my way I can take a quick look for you, if you like.</p>
<p>Alternatively, try running the game with developer 2 enabled. This makes all entities output their entity logic to the console, and you can then go over the console log and debug.</p>
