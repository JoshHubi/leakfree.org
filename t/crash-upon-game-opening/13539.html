<p>but i doubt that would cause any trouble.</p>
<p>i have tested other mods and other source mods have the same issue, including mods that have been greenlit and are on steam, HL2 games, Episodes, TF2, CS:S, CS:GO and all other related games boot and work 100% fine, have also tried deleting the clientregistry.blob, still no change.</p>
<p>tried forcing -window, still crashed, tried setting resolution with -width 1920 -height 1080, still no good, tried setting -dxlevel, still crashes, pretty much out of options on what to do.</p>
<p>any help would be appreaciated, cheers.</p>
