    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-upon-game-opening/13539</link>
    <description>im sure you have seen this issue before, however i have tried everything over a 2 days period, read alot of threads, tried alot of methods, nothing seems to work.


i am using Windows 7 and have run steam as an administrator, deleted BMS entirely and did a fresh download, re-installed 3 times, deleted Source SDK base 2007 and re-installed several times, i did a condump and i got this:
[code]maxplayers set to 1

but i doubt that would cause any trouble.

i have tested other mods and other source mods have the same issue, including mods that have been greenlit and are on steam, HL2 games, Episodes, TF2, CS:S, CS:GO and all other related games boot and work 100% fine, have also tried deleting the clientregistry.blob, still no change.

tried forcing -window, still crashed, tried setting resolution with -width 1920 -height 1080, still no good, tried setting -dxlevel, still crashes, pretty much out of options on what to do.

any help would be appreaciated, cheers.</description>
