    <title>game looks funky and weird</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-looks-funky-and-weird/10872</link>
    <description>for some reason my game looks like this:
[url]https://img.photobucket.com/albums/v233/dragon143/bms_zps58dcae78.jpg[/url]
i&#39;ve tryed all the funky stuff with directx which is written in faq but none of those work actually. i&#39;ve noticed that if i turn off hud post processes i could see something, with it being enabled all i could see were pink and black squares only all over the screen.
my pc specs:
core2quad q6600
geforce 9600 gso
windows xp
might be the drivers issue but i&#39;ve used to play tf2 with the drivers i have already instaled so dunno ^_^.</description>

            <p>Put it simple, there are two major ways to download the game:</p>
<ol>
<li>Official download mirrors.</li>
<li>Torrent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Choose any of these, there are no other options (expect for finding a friend who has the game downloaded and copying installation files from him).</p>
<p>As for the game looking like in screenshots: it could be anything starting from software/hardware related problem and ending with corrupted game data files.<br>
Redownload/reinstall. If the problem persist - try updating the drivers. Game is known to work normally (except for some performance issues - but that’s something everybody suffers from to some extent) on the hardware like you have. BTW, how much VRAM your GPU has? You hadn’t posted it and I remember that there were some low-cost video cards having next-to-none VRAM installed on them and using main system RAM as a storage space for textures. In case you have such - it could be your problem cause.</p>

            <p>Looks like your missing all the textures AND models.<br>
Might want to try reinstalling the mod.</p>
<p>Make sure the path is: Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS<br>
Otherwise it will have missing text and stuff.</p>

            <p>You probably just downloaded a corrupted file. Try redownloading it.</p>
