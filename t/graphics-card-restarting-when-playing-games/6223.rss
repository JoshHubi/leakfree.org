            <p>look at the post above yours, i have checked the power supply, and it is the culprit. Its still working but not at full power. Going to get a new one soon (if it fixes it, which is 99% chance it will cuz i can play normaly without it pluged in) and the GPU temp is ok, its not good norr bad.</p>

<p>i had a similar problem 3 years ago when i had my old hardware with a geforce 8600 GTS. there were two problems: first the GPU-cooler was broken. the second was that the power supply didn’t provide enough power anymore for the GPU on the 12V power rail. i’ve found this out with everest ultimate and sisoft sandra. 2 or 3 weeks later the PS died. so maybe you should check your power supply if the GPU-temp is ok.</p>

            <p>Overheating doesn’t necessarily effect the FPS… it often triggers sudden system reboots or stuff like that.</p>
<p>Did you check the system event logs? In the administration tools, you can view these things… perhaps  would show up something in there.</p>

            <p>See, but with rivatuner, you can’t lower the fan speeds on his lappy, because of how the fans are wired. (Something along the lines of dediicated fans or something, i don’t remember the term.)</p>
<p>I’m almost positive you have an ASUS, and lemme tell you, that’s where you fucked up.</p>

            <p>I can almost be positive you installed the incorrect drivers.<br>
If you’re one of those cool kids who tried to play with that 3d-shit technology (Which you might be) Revert to the old driver, or update the driver.<br>
If that’s not the case.</p>
<p>Open up your lappy, and clean it out, because i can bet you’re a dirty pig.</p>
<p>Oh, and retard, your laptop does have a fan.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem a while back with my gtx 275 initially.  It was overheating because I didn’t have a profile for fan speeds to automatically adjust according to temperature when I bought it.  Now there are no problems.</p>
<p>Download a driver (I recommend from nvidia) that lets you control fan speeds.</p>

            <p>First off try updating your drivers officially: <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-uk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here</a></p>
<p>If that does not work then try unofficial drivers: <a href="https://www.omegadrivers.net/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;view=section&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=55" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here</a></p>

            <p>Clean your fucking computer, especially the heatsink on the GPU.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t help, change the clock speed 50mhz lower, if that doesn’t help put it back and take off 50mhz off the RAM.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t help, get a new GPU!</p>
