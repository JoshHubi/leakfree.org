    <title>Creatures from HL1 that were removed from HL2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/creatures-from-hl1-that-were-removed-from-hl2/2798</link>
    <description>I was always puzzled by this. How come there are Head Crabs, Barnacles and Vortigaunts in HL2, but none of the other creatures? 

I thought about the idea of the Combine exterminating them all, but it&#39;s impossible to kill every single one of them. I understand them keeping the headcrabs as some sort of biological weapon, but the barnacles just sit around, eating whatever shit passes bye, and it looks like they didn&#39;t even make an attempt at killing them.

Plus, bull squids kicked ass.

            <p>The Combine found out how to use head-crabs as weapons, and they put Vortigaunts to work as slaves. And they never really found a need to kill of the barnacles, guess they thought it would control the pest problem?</p>

<p>I thought about the idea of the Combine exterminating them all, but it’s impossible to kill every single one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think it’s impossible that the Combine exterminated them. We’ve managed to do that with many of Earth’s native inhabitants without even trying, so it doesn’t seem that far fetched that an advanced alien race would be able to do it if they had the motivation. Even if there were any left, there’s going to be so little about that it’s not unreasonable that we haven’t seen any. Also, we don’t know how many were teleported here, or how well they can survive in this environment for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>I understand them keeping the headcrabs as some sort of biological weapon, but the barnacles just sit around, eating whatever shit passes bye, and it looks like they didn’t even make an attempt at killing them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, that’s just it. They just sit around, so the only people they’re going to have much of an opportunity to eat are people hiding out in dilapidated areas where they’re going to grow. The Combine probably already quickly remove any which are going to be much of a threat to them or their citizens.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think the reason we see the aliens we do are thus:</p>
<p>Headcrabs: Biological weaponry. 'Nuff said.</p>
<p>Barnacles: Already explained above.</p>
<p>Antlions: Breed too fast, and can generally be kept back with thumpers/restrictors in any case.</p>
<p>Leeches and Ichthyosaurs: The Combine don’t seem to express much interest in the ocean, so they likely don’t think it’s worth getting rid of them. Also, they’re apparently draining the seas, so they probably look at it in the long term.</p>

            <p>Under a bridge. Like a troll.</p>
<p>And to answer the barnacle question, aren’t barnacles small fungus untill the’yre on the ceiling? so the combines would have to find every single spore to exterminate them.</p>

            <p>I’d like to believe they’re still around, just not in City 17. If we see some in Episode 3 that would be awesome though.</p>
<p>EDIT: On second thought, if the Nihilanth and Combine were sworn enemies, it would makes sense for them to exterminate all Xenians that don’t serve their purposes during their invasion, but like the OP says, I doubt they could get all of them.</p>

            <p>Actually, some of those “removed” creatures still exists in the HL2 universe… the point is just that Gordon didn’t see one of them yet. Think about the Icthyosaur. See what I mean?</p>
<p>But others like the Controller or the AGrunt just don’t fit into HL2. Not after Nihilanth’s death’s.</p>
<p>And some creatures like the tentacles or gargs would be hunted down by the combine. Also, where could a Gargantua hide?</p>
