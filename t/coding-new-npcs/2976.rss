    <title>Coding new NPCs</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/coding-new-npcs/2976</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been attempting to code some new NPCs just for fun, but i&#39;m having trouble getting them to behave the way i want them to, ive tried the valve developer wiki and the mailing list etc (which seems a very tedious way of finding information) I was wondering if perhaps the devs or someone else had a good link to a tutorial that goes into more detail than the valve wiki. Cheers</description>
