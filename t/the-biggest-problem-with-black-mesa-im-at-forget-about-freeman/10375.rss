    <description>You guys [i]really[/i] overdid it with the crouch jumping.  I&#39;m at a step-high ledge, and I cannot hop onto it with a simple jump.  I mean come on, guys.  I can understand it for the actual jumping puzzles, but if I&#39;m just doing simple navigation I don&#39;t see why I need to constantly mash my Control key.</description>

<p>I agree, I believe they should trash the crouch jumping mechanic entirely and just increase our jump height.</p>

<p>You can change the jump height through the console, I forgot the command though.</p>
<p>Personally I didn’t find it too bad. I’m so used to doing it all the time in HL2 anyway since the jump height in HL2 was relatively the same, there just wasn’t that many sections were you had to go “higher” like in HL1, it was more to make gaps or jump on objects.</p>
