<p>I did nothing special, except add the map into bms/maps , and added a fastDL link into server.cfg , also changed what’s inside the mapcycle.txt to dm_killbox_v1e</p>

<p>Hm, that did the trick.<br>

</aside>
<p>Also known as: “time out, try later”, as far as I can remember, so just re-trying to upload your file should probably do the trick.<br>
Also, how did you manage to get custom maps working on your server?Mine won’t detect any add-ons besides SourceMod &amp; Metamod.</p>

<li>
<p>The source code for the ggun was removed. If it gets to the game, then the game is ruined for sure and you do not seem against it, surely because you are a burned scripter already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not care if you believe if I cheat or not, I know what the truth is about my fate and I do not need anyone to bring anything on the table. They could not find a better reason to ban me, so they went on and invent anything. I would like to tell you I burned Maxtasy using ggun script. The one who does not like cheaters cheats himself, ironic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Black Mesa is dev’s game and if they want to patch the plugin, they will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not cheat? Surely is not what the newly anti-cheat plugin says when your client-side files were analyzed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will conclude this to prevent starting a fight between us that I have been playing for way longer than probably the whole community on HL2DM and I am qualified to know who is clean and who is not.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anymore replies from now on will be ignored.</p>

            <p>First of all, I’m not the one who is doing the plugin for the gravity gun on BMS.</p>
<p>Second of all, I didn’t ruin anything, don’t blame me on what the other admins took action on, my opinion regarding you was that you were clean, and the fact that you were banned on <a href="http://hl2dm.net" rel="nofollow noopener">hl2dm.net</a> is because you DDoS-ed the site out of anger.</p>
<p>Third of all, devs will not stop the fact that gravity gun is getting developed unless they limit the usability of addons/plugins/console.</p>
<p>Fourth of all, I don’t cheat if you meant to say it, indirectly to me. Stop crying over the past and get over it.</p>
<p>If you want to open the “cheaters” discussion here then we will not conclude anything except the fact that you, like some accusers I have in mind and you probably know who they are, don’t have extensive and long experience to judge someone if they are cheating or not.</p>
<p>My game is updated, thanks for your suggestion. (It still doesn’t work)</p>

            <p>Update your game.</p>
<p>Also a question for you -&gt; Why do you insist on bringing the gravity gun to BMS? Do you want to ruin the game like you did on HL2DM along with other cheaters/scripters?</p>
<p>I beg the devs to not let this happen, otherwise cheaters will ruin the game.</p>
