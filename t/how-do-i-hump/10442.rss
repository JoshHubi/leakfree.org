    <title>how do I hump</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-do-i-hump/10442</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t get this. I hit enter yet I can never jump high enough to get on most of the stuff. This is completely ruining the game. I find I need to do some sort of weird alt-space jump to get on some of these pipes/boxes. This takes minutes and is 0 fun, so I cant imagine this is part of the game....

Whats going on? Right now I cant even progress in the game because ive spent the last 10 minutes on the bridge collapse part of the game and cant get over one of the pipes...</description>

<p>tbh I disagree with both of you, although I am more than capable of doing it manually, and very well I may add, and used to this style for over a decade, to some players it is another thing to think about that isn’t natural, and really not needed, the question is, is there any occasion during the mod where a normal jump is preferable than a duck jump? if no, then it should be removed, its a pointless feature and all jumps should be duck jumps (imo ofc). Once multiplayer hits I’ll use a script 100% of the time, just because i have another key bound to a weapon, and not duck (I don’t really need to duck with a duck jump script as i can just hold key, and land in a crouched position into the area I need to be).</p>

<p>It takes minutes to press 2 buttons at once?</p>
<p>It’s CROUCH JUMPING. IT IS AN INTERGAL ELEMENT OF HALF LIFE. IT HAS BEEN SINCE 98, AND HAS BEEN PRESENT AND USEFUL IN EVERY VALVE GAME SINCE.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but I’ve got to explode. I can’t wrap my head around how people can’t wrap their head around the intricate complexities of <em>gasp</em> PRESSING TWO BUTTONS AT ONCE HOLY SHIT. How in any way is this difficult? I mean, if it’s that much of an issue, you can re-bind crouch to something more accessible. I had to do it because alt negates my space bar if I press it before I jump, so the LJM was useless. I re-bound it to C, and it worked great.</p>
<p>Also, this is possibly the best thread title in the history of this forum. Pre-release included.</p>

            <p>bms_normal_vertical_height or something along those lines. Try fussing around in the console. But yeah, the jump height is pretty low, you have to crouch jump everything.</p>
