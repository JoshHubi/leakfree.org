    <title>legacy game does not install correctly</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/legacy-game-does-not-install-correctly/15299</link>
    <description>I recently played Half Life and then remembered Black Mesa, so decided to try it again.  It worked fine back in 2012.

I installed and ran source SDK, source 2007 SDK, created a BMS folder in sourcemod, and DLed the installer.  The only place I could DL from is ModDB which has the 2 part installer.  So it is installed and shows as 7.06gb in size but has no .EXE.  No way to run it.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it trying different combinations 4 times now and always get the same result.

There must be something I&#39;m missing but I do not know what it might be.</description>

            <p>I was extracting the zip files directly into the steamapps folder, both in and outside of the BMS folder.   This did not work.</p>
<p>This time I extracted the files into its own folder and then moved that folder into steamapps.  When I restarted steam it worked this time.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>when you extract the 2 zip files it should create a folder and in that folder you should have a few other folders and the gameinfo.txt cut and paste that folder into the sourcemods folder, it might be setup like sourcemods/blackmesa and not sourcemods/bms, start or restart steam and the blackmesa link should be in the games libary</p>

            <p>Could just buy the game, you’d won’t have to hassle with installing mods then.</p>
<ul>
<li>You get lots of free workshop maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Black Friday is coming up soon… Steam will probably have some good prices on games then, including BMS.</p>
