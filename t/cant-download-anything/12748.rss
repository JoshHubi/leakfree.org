    <title>Can&#39;t download anything</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-download-anything/12748</link>
    <description>So I recently got a new HDD, and reinstalled Windows 7 on it again.
So I went to download Steam, but for some reason it just stays at &quot;Waiting for cdn.steampowered.com&quot;.I tried other downloads, but the same result with the &quot;Waiting for [download server]&quot;.After waiting, I just end up not being able to connect to it.
I&#39;m also not able to watch video&#39;s anywhere.
However, I&#39;m able to download &amp; watch stuff from my laptop.

Anyone knows what could cause this?</description>
