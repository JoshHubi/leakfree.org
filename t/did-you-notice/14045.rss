    <title>Did you notice?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/did-you-notice/14045</link>
    <description>I have noticed some things in the Black Mesa: Source game:

1 - In the cold chamber part, from &quot;Apprehension&quot;, the HUD status shows damage from BURNING?
2 - I never have seen a damage by biological hazard. In the &quot;Residue Processing&quot; for example, the green toxic waste tanks are radioactive. I am not sure if in HL1, they are radioactive too.

If I am mistaken, or if the error was correct, disconsider my message. ?(</description>
