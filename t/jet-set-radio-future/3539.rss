    <title>Jet Set Radio Future</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/jet-set-radio-future/3539</link>
    <description>I had one of the original XBoxes, the huge ones, and I played the hell out of this game. The whole cell shaded aspect and the aggressive inline combined with graffiti made it really interesting to me.

Which isn&#39;t to mention the soundtrack..

So, is there anyone else here that played and loved this game?</description>

            <p>That game was really addicting. My friend used to have it way back and I’d hijack his Xbox and play for hours. The soundtrack was really awesome too. Funny thing is, I don’t remember exactly why you skate around tagging over people’s stuff, but hell, who cares?</p>
