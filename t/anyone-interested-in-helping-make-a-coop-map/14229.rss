    <title>Anyone interested in helping make a coop map?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anyone-interested-in-helping-make-a-coop-map/14229</link>
    <description>I was testing NPCs &amp; A.I. logics in multiplayer, and it seems stable.  Rather than spend 5 months myself (I tend to burnout rather quickly), I figure a team could knock out a decently-long cooperative map in a month or so.  Just drop me a line if you are interested  :slight_smile:</description>
