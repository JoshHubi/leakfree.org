    <title>What is YOUR favourite Boss Battle of all time?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-your-favourite-boss-battle-of-all-time/785</link>
    <description>Like most of these situations, the title says it all.
What is your favourite boss battle from any game? it could be because of the emotion it produces, the memorable dialogue, or even the way the bad guy fell over in the end. A battle that you truely found awesome. :awesome:

I&#39;ll start off. My favourite boss battle so far has to be the final face off between Solid Snake and Liquid Ocelot on top of the Outer Haven at the end of Metal Gear Solid 4. Plays as something of an interactive cutscene, but epic none the less. The constant tension between the characters through the series finally climaxes (:jizz :slight_smile:  in an unforgetable, no nonsense fist fight. Fucking win.

Big Boss?! :pirate:</description>

<p>Well  I supose Fontaine did in a way, But when your dealing with idea’s like that theres no room for half measures.</p>
<p>Its all or nothing, the really intresting thing about Fontaine was that he was one of the only sane people with you through out.</p>
<p>A sane coherent chalenger is always going to be more intresting than a slavering monster.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d disagree with you there. He seemed pretty damn unhinged, but then pretended to be a sane person through most of the game. If he wasn’t, I think taking that much adam would send him the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Also, why not have a lucid slavering monster? I think I’d find that infinitely more disturbing.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It never made sense to me. All the splicers have seriously fucked up features and use relatively little adam (presumably), so I would have thought someone using that much adam at once would go all Resident Evil and turn into some kind of misshapen grotesque.</p>

<p>Dude, you just reminded me of the most epic boss battle ever! The Butcher in Diablo!</p>
<p>Seriously, who didn’t think it was awesome hearing the “FRESH MEAT!” when you were 10 years old? And the whole room filled with blood and mutilated corpses?</p>
<p>And he wasn’t even a hard/final boss, he was at the what? Third floor?</p>

            <p>It took me almost an hour to beat the Twilight Princess boss because I didn’t want to hit Zelda. That was just a cheap shot, Nintendo  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I don’t really count that puppet battle as part of the real Ganon battle in WW, since it’s before Ganon’s monologue. I like to think of it as an independent miniboss  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Shadows of the Colossus is an obvious choice for Epic boss battles. That’s the only type of battle it has.</p>
<p>Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess was also one of the most epic Ganon battles I’ve played. Wind Waker was good, but the use of puppetry rather cheapened the entire experience. Twilight Princess gives you the magic duel, the monster duel, the horseback duel, and then the mano-a-mano duel to wrap things up. Very satisfying.</p>

            <p>The final boss from Shadow of the Colossus is definitely high on my list. Also the boss of Arbiter’s Grounds from Twilight Princess (freakin’ Skeleton Dragon! The best boss of the game, definitely!) and the boss of GTA4 is fun for the drama factor.</p>
<p>I also beat Dungeon Siege 2 the other day which, by itself, may not be that awesome of ab oss fight, but I want listening to Our Solemn Hour by Within Temptation, and it really spruced it up.</p>
<p>And, of course, Ganon in The Wind Waker. To this day, one of them most emotional, dramatic boss fights ever conceived.</p>
<p>Honestly, in so many pages I’m surprised Shadow of the Colossus hasn’t already been mentioned. Every awesome boss fight ever packed into one game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Also, mention of T2T seems to be popular, but I thought that boss battle was drawn-out and frustrating (and I love the PoP series). I mean, it was just one long, crazy quicktime event with some rock-dodging thrown in…</p>

<p>And probably like, most of the bosses in the Devil May Cry series… They’re pretty fun.</p>
<p>I just like whatever bosses give that epic feeling and it takes forever to kill them and you feel like you ~accomplished something after.</p>

<p>Ah yes, Ultemicia is damn hard.</p>
