    <title>Wired and Wireless PC File sharing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wired-and-wireless-pc-file-sharing/11109</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t get much help from Google and I don&#39;t have much time to go to the library. It&#39;s a burden to plug my flash drive over and over. How can I grant file sharing between a netbook(using wifi) and a desktop(connected to a modem)?</description>

            <p>Yeah if your just moving smaller files around drop box will save you the headache.  If you have larger files then you might want to treat your pc as a server and use something like FTP.</p>

            <p>You could use dropbox like some of us.<br>
Default free plan is 2gb’s, with a referral it’s 2.5 though.</p>
