    <title>GTX 560 rattling problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gtx-560-rattling-problem/7240</link>
    <description>Sup guys, I just got a new video card, a GTX 560 Ti 2gb, installed it a couple of days ago, amazing card. 

Just yesterday I started getting this problem, it sounded like the video card was rattling from time to time, almost as if the fans were skimming against the plastic cover that&#39;s over them from time to time.

Most of the time its fine, but occasionally (idle or in a game) it starts to rattle faintly for anywhere from a half a second to 1 or 2 seconds. Today I tried opening it up and popping the card to see if the fans were loose but the cover was blocking any connections that may have been for the fan, so I tightened the visible screws just a bit. As I expected, it did nothing, and the sound still happens from time to time. 

I just would like to know how worried I should be and should I send it in, or would it not really matter enough to warrant that? Also, if anyone knows the 560 and how to tighten the fans, that would be helpful too.</description>

            <p>It depends on how much you spent on your current heatsink, if standard or cheap then just get a new one, I would like to add Xilence as a cheap option, but when going for air, I personally go for Noctua.</p>

            <p>*cooler master hyper 212+</p>
<p>And yeah I also recommend that one, although check to make sure there’s enough room in your case for it, and maybe consider doing a push-pull configuration.</p>

            <p>Alright to be sure, I removed the video card, and I unplugged the case fans to make sure it wasn’t them. It’s the CPU heatsink. From what I’ve read the rattling means that the fans are dying.</p>
<p>What do you guys think is the better route? Getting a new heatsink entirely, or replacing the fan in this one with one of the same size?</p>

            <p>It sounds to me like a bearing is shot in your card fan, I just had that happen on one of mine. I’d take it in, if your fan seizes, you could fry the card.</p>

            <p>After opening the case while the computer was on and feeling the side of the video card fan cover and listening, It actually seems to be the heatsink making the noise. It seems to have stopped for now though. Hopefully it doesn’t come back but I’m sure it will.</p>
