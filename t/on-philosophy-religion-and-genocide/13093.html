<p>euhm no, if you hold to the evolution theory without higher power, any genocide is equally disastrous to the survival of the species. There is no reason why Europeans or Asians would be a better choice, not even because there are many of them or because they currently have great material wealth. Genetically, the distinction is arbitrary.<br>
If anything, killing all Europeans or all Asians would free up more resources for the rest than any other ‚Äúrace‚Äù. Which is what Ramirezoid was getting at, I think.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I do not think this would be true. If everything is simply a mechanical entity with no other force behind it save the same physics that hurl asteroids through space and burn stars, if your intended goal is to keep such entities replicating, you would naturally use strains that have proven traits of high adaptability, though I agree culling any other races generally would come with more cons than pros.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also pretty much impossible to use ‚Äúrace‚Äù with any sort of accuracy, since superficial differences don‚Äôt necessarily speak to genetic ones.<br>
A white dude could be more closely related to some black dude than some other white dude, and vice versa. Or not. There‚Äôs no way to know unless you do DNA testing, and even then it‚Äôs subject to interpretation and error.</p>

<p>This sounds like you are measuring humans with a different scale than common animals. Pitbulls tend to be more violent, Greyhounds tend to be faster, Pomeranians tend to be more noisy, etc. As noted, they are all dogs, yet they all show physical as well as mental differences within each breed/race/strain. It is impossible for someone to be atheistic, believe in evolution and not believe in racial superiority in one form or another (by this I mean: Whites are superior in X, blacks are superior in Y, etc). It‚Äôs one of the fundamental laws governing evolutionary theory.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs an element of luck behind everything in the universe. Call it ‚ÄúThe Hand of God,‚Äù or what have you. Doesn‚Äôt matter. Evolution not a purely mechanical entity as it stands. If it wasn‚Äôt for luck the Human species as we know it wouldn‚Äôt be here let alone exist.</p>
<p>Different ‚Äúraces‚Äù have different genetic traits, some legacies have genes that are resistant or outright immune against the HIV virus (FYI, 20% of the European population have/has this resistance/immunity; they DO have something to contribute to the species as a whole  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ). That‚Äôs something highly desirable from a genetic point of view, but in terms of a person, their genetic makeup is not what makes them who they are.

</aside>
<p>From an evolutionary standpoint, dogs have been more specialized to a niche due to artificial breeding practices. I can‚Äôt speak to the human genome, but we aren‚Äôt so genetically specialized for an environment. We live practically everywhere on the earth and adapt the environment to our needs rather than the other way around. So it doesn‚Äôt really apply here.</p>
<p>Genetically speaking, Humans are less diverse than dogs when it comes to physical traits (e.g. speed). We as a species have different body types, but they‚Äôre less specialized than a dogs or a cats is.</p>

<p>So, basically racism is always going to exist in some form regardless of what you do? (straighten it out, I can‚Äôt make much sense to this - call me an idiot)</p>
<p>True some people are better at things than others, but really, our bodies are practically all built the same irregardless of gender and race: A black guy can be just as good as a white girl at hockey or what have you if the individual practices it enough, but some people have a natural talent for it. It varies between people <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> animals.</p>
<p>Take Orcas (killer whales) for example: Each pod has their own hunting patterns, some of them purposefully beach themselves to get a seal close to the water line, sometimes that behavior is unique to that pod, other times it isn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>As rot pointed out, it‚Äôs a fundamental law. Not much you can do. Some people are superior to others in some ways (e.g. HIV immunity/resistance), it‚Äôs just the way things are, but am I saying blacks are better at basketball than whites are? No. Maybe if the person involved was better built than the other, sure, but not because of the color of their skin, but because they took better care of themselves.</p>

<p>From an evolutionary standpoint, dogs have been more specialized to a niche due to artificial breeding practices. I can‚Äôt speak to the human genome, but we aren‚Äôt so genetically specialized for an environment. We live practically everywhere on the earth and adapt the environment to our needs rather than the other way around. So it doesn‚Äôt really apply here.</p>
<p>Genetically speaking, Humans are less diverse than dogs when it comes to physical traits (e.g. speed). We as a species have different body types, but they‚Äôre less specialized than a dogs or a cats is.</p>

</aside>
<p>I could have used a better example perhaps. It‚Äôs the same general idea for breeds of dogs, or for entirely different species (if you believe we all started out as soup), as it is for races. Certain groups, whether from the smallest scale being a personal family or to the largest scale of being a mouse versus  an oak tree, every ‚Äúliving‚Äù thing will be specialized in some way or another that sets it apart from everything else. Tying this back to the original topic, it does not make sense to commit mass genocide on the more successful strains of evolution.</p>

<p>While it‚Äôs regrettable, sometimes you do need mass genocide for a new species to flourish. The rise of dinosaurs, mammals, and other such critters would have been unlikely if not for the mass extinctions that happened in the ancient past.</p>
<p>Tying this to the topic, while it a genetic bottleneck occurs, it provides a smaller gene pool and better genes to spread to the species that survive the event. I don‚Äôt condone the mass murder of a certain group of people (be it jews, black, white, or what have you), but its a tool that nature uses quite frequently throughout our past history that the evidence points to.</p>

</aside>
<p>My philosophical point of view on Evolution vs Creationism is really a mix of the two. There‚Äôs no evidence (yet) that this happened or that happened. Creationism is too far-fetched for me, and frankly, anything that crazy people spout is to be ignored. Atheism‚Äôs too extreme as well, the world is not as black and white as they say.</p>
<p>It happened by pure chance in my honest opinion. Nothing more, nothing less. The hand of god may have been behind it for all I know - frankly this is really the stance that creationists should take in this day and age. The evidence points to the Earth being 4 billion years old if not older, and life may have been transplanted or evolved from extremophile bacteria (google it) that existed at the creation stages of the Earth or we came from soup, I don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>To my original point, it was all chance. Some atheists make it black and white, it‚Äôs not. Mutations by their very nature are unpredictable, it depends on the creature (or person), how damaged the genetic material is (through radiation or degradation), and a whole slew of other factors. Saying that you can predict what path life will take in four generations is like predicting when and where exactly to the letter the next hurricane of the season will form next week (I wanted to come up with a witty example, but I couldn‚Äôt think of anything funny). It‚Äôs neigh impossible.</p>

          <p>Didn‚Äôt read everything, three quick points:</p>
<ol>
<li>The point is that appearance or place of birth have nothing to do with genetic traits. Race is a social construct with <span class="bbcode-i">absolutely no basis in biology</span>.<br>
If you kill all white people you wipe out the genes for low pigmentation, that‚Äôs all you can really say with certainty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Race (=appearance) != DNA</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Please don‚Äôt tell me what I believe. As an atheist, I simply hold no belief in any god. Any of my other beliefs or ideas have nothing to do with my atheism.<br>
I believe luck is just a term for happy coincidences, which is subjective and thus not a real thing. Everything is pretty much random, so effectively everything is a coincidence, luck is just when things coincide in your favour.</li>
</ol>
<p>The absence of a deity does not require a mechanical universe. Quantum theory shows that pretty clearly.</p>

<li>Evolution does not work by weeding out weaker strains. Some genes or species die out because that‚Äôs what happens. Things die. Most of the time it has more to do with circumstance than with actual fitness, or with an evolutionary arms race type situation.<br>
Actually, that‚Äôs what fitness means. Fitness (in evolutionary terms) is simply an organism‚Äôs suitability to survive in its environment, so in fact everything is circumstantial.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fun fact: we are no more or less evolved than chimpanzees. We (humans and chimpanzees) are all just a bunch of apes who stopped having sex with eachother a few million years ago.</p>
<p>Oh, one more, very important point. Leaving everything else aside, there is noooooo reason to say that white people (Europeans) are a ‚Äúsuccessful race‚Äù, definitely not in the long term. Our current relative ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù has been going for a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the existence of the modern human species.</p>
<p>‚Äì</p>
<p>Mass extinction isn‚Äôt genocide, and it doesn‚Äôt provide anything to make a species ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. Species just change. If we were living 100 million years ago you wouldn‚Äôt call us ‚Äúbetter‚Äù at anything, we would have no chance of survival. Species change because environments change, there is no good or bad, advanced or primitive, there is only alive or dead.</p>
<p>If you kill all white people, maybe you end up killing a gene that would‚Äôve made everyone immune to some horrible disease. Maybe if you kill all black people you end up doing the same. There really is no objective criteria to predict or estimate what effect killing any particular ‚Äúrace‚Äù would have on the evolution of the species.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unless you deny that race is a social construct (which it is), what you‚Äôre describing, rot, is basically social Darwinism, which is what neo-Nazis, for example, often subscribe to; so I don‚Äôt need to explain why it‚Äôs wrong, I hope.</p>
<hr>
<p>also, watch the video idi linked, because it /thread within the first five minutes</p>
<p>btw, what really started this was Ramirezoid saying (jokingly) we should kill all white people because that includes (nearly) all rich powerful people<br>
and sorry if I sound serious, that‚Äôs not the intention  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

          <p>Perhaps you‚Äôve misunderstood me (Or you are making an aside point) I (myself) agree that there is 0% good reasons to commit genocide of any kind (for personal moral beliefs). The point I was making, is that if there is no moral right or wrong, just being alive or dead as you say, it would be particularly counterproductive to eliminate whites and/or asians, as they are by far the most plentiful versions of the species, which would suggest they are doing something ‚Äúright‚Äù as far as evolutionary survival goes. The interesting thing is that racism is probably a very prominent factor in why there are so many whites around today. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre different, we kill you and take your land for us‚Äù, while barbaric and morally abhorrent, seems to be quite a successful survival strategy.</p>
<p>And sorry Bur, I was not meaning to say ‚ÄúAthiests all believe X‚Äù. Personally I don‚Äôt know any Atheists who do not have morals, what I was getting at is that without a God, morals have no value, which would put genocide on the same level as walking to the store and buying a piece of fruit; just another thing that happens. Again, I don‚Äôt know anyone (scratch that, I don‚Äôt know many people) who would be pro-genocide in any circumstance. I‚Äôm just saying that if it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwrong‚Äù well, what happens?</p>
<p>Actually to change the subject a little, and only if you want to talk about it, what is your personal views on morals? I‚Äôm curious to know.</p>

          <p>I‚Äôm totally on a line with most of what bur said. The discussion is also based on assumptions that some of you maybe got wrong. First of all, I think a big problem here could be the misconceiving view on some terms like ‚Äúrace‚Äù for example. Like bur put it,  ‚Äúrace‚Äù is first of all an artificial, made up term, a sociological construct that has no meaning in the science (biology), except that we use it synonymous with subspecies, for example for domesticated animals like dogs. You may confuse it with species, which in itself isn‚Äôt even as rock solid as you want. There are many concepts on species (morphological, population genetic, phylogenetic concepts, to name a few), with currently no sufficient and absolute theory.</p>

</aside>
<p>It would be counterproductive to eliminate anyone, not more or less based on any (socially constructed) ethnicity or skin color, that‚Äôs what bur said. Whites/ and or asians as you have put it, don‚Äôt do anything more ‚Äúright‚Äù than any other species. With this logic, just because they are more in numbers, insects or microorganisms would be the most ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù living entities in this world. In contrast to that, you can deem any species successful that currently lives on this planet.</p>
<p>And to hold racism as a point that there are so many whites today and this seems to you as a ‚Äúsuccessful survival strategy‚Äù is, pardon me, just laughable.</p>
<p>By linking any shady characteristics to " evolutionary superiority", you are really getting in social darwinism range. By that logic, all people that pushed this idea would have to start with wiping themselves out, because they will have at least one trait that‚Äôs flawed.</p>

</aside>
<p>Couldn‚Äôt have put it better myself. We just think we stand on the end of the evolutionary chain, because we are self-aware, can think and have culture, build metropoles all over the world and so on (traits that to some extent also applies to some other animals, albeit not so far and complex like we humans have). In fact, we are not. There is no ‚Äúperfect‚Äù species, some kind of super organism that someday will evolve. Species simply are vehicles for their genetic material, which gets constantly tested by the environment and must pass the test of time. If it gets approved, they live on and inherit their specific code. If not, they die out. Simple as that.</p>
<p>As far as morals go‚Ä¶ hm‚Ä¶ another social construct invented by mankind that seemingly has no counterpart in nature. I say seemingly because also in nature social things like altruism, caring for others and so on can be observed. Still, I think it‚Äôs good they are there, if religion provides you with it, that‚Äôs fine, in my opinion, mankind can have moral standards or codes also without the need for religion.</p>
<p>How these moral codex‚Äôs look like and after what criteria you build them is another thing. You could argue yourself to death about topics like this, so I‚Äôll leave it at that.</p>

<p>Didn‚Äôt read everything, three quick points:</p>

<li>The point is that appearance or place of birth have nothing to do with genetic traits. Race is a social construct with <span class="bbcode-i">absolutely no basis in biology</span>.<br>
If you kill all white people you wipe out the genes for low pigmentation, that‚Äôs all you can really say with certainty.</li>

<p>Oh, one more, very important point. Leaving everything else aside, there is noooooo reason to say that white people (Europeans) are a ‚Äúsuccessful race‚Äù, definitely not in the long term.

<p>I‚Äôm totally on a line with most of what bur said. The discussion is also based on assumptions that some of you maybe got wrong. First of all, I think a big problem here could be the misconceiving view on some terms like ‚Äúrace‚Äù for example. Like bur put it,  ‚Äúrace‚Äù is first of all an artificial, made up term, a sociological construct that has no meaning in the science (biology), except that we use it synonymous with subspecies, for example for domesticated animals like dogs. You may confuse it with species, which in itself isn‚Äôt even as rock solid as you want. There are many concepts on species (morphological, population genetic, phylogenetic concepts, to name a few), with currently no sufficient and absolute theory.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, I understand this I think. I see it like a tree, where two separate branches may represent the difference between say, a squirrel and a dog, and where two separate twigs may represent the difference between individual families.  It‚Äôs the same basic principle in varying levels, from macro-evolution to micro-evolution. all the words used to describe each particular‚Ä¶ stage, if you will, are simply words. It‚Äôs the same thing happening on all levels if you hold to such a theory, am I correct?</p>

<p>It would be counterproductive to eliminate anyone, not more or less based on any (socially constructed) ethnicity or skin color, that‚Äôs what bur said. Whites/ and or asians as you have put it, don‚Äôt do anything more ‚Äúright‚Äù than any other species. With this logic, just because they are more in numbers, insects or microorganisms would be the most ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù living entities in this world. In contrast to that, you can deem any species successful that currently lives on this planet.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree it would be counterproductive to eliminate any particular race, as that eliminates genetic material for no reason. I do not agree that it would be evenly counterproductive to eliminate any particular race, whether it be majority or minority. To make my point clearer, lets say you have this camp out in the wilderness with one hundred clones, ten of them wear blue shirts, twenty wear yellow shirts and seventy wear red shirts, you cannot tell me that if you had to remove one group it wouldn‚Äôt matter which group you decided to eliminate, and that is based solely on numbers and nothing else.</p>
<p>I would say that microorganisms probably <span class="bbcode-b">would</span> be the most successful in terms of survivability goes, perhaps humans are the most complex, but they are certainly not the most plentiful and definitely not the most adaptable if you are including all forms of ‚Äúlife‚Äù. Probably the most adaptable as far as macro-organisms are concerned, but no, if the only goal for life is to keep living and spreading, bacteria and other such things have got us all beat by miles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And to hold racism as a point that there are so many whites today and this seems to you as a ‚Äúsuccessful survival strategy‚Äù is, pardon me, just laughable.</p>
<p>By linking any shady characteristics to " evolutionary superiority", you are really getting in social darwinism range. By that logic, all people that pushed this idea would have to start with wiping themselves out, because they will have at least one trait that‚Äôs flawed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But isn‚Äôt this the basis for all evolution, the strong survive? For billions of years life has been taking it‚Äôs strongest (by brute force, intelligence, resourcefulness or otherwise) strains and snuffing the other, less adaptable ones out. I‚Äôm glad you brought up social darwinism, that was kind of what I was hinting at with all of this, with the continuation of life being the only goal, would that not make genocide at worst, counterproductive and at best, the strengthening of the species?</p>
