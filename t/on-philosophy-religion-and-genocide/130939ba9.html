</aside>
<p>Depending on which definition of ice age you’re going by, the last was either 260,000,000 or 22,000 years ago. Humans started practicing agriculture about 12,000 years ago.</p>
<p>What exactly are you implying? That there was some sort of lost civilization, more advanced than our current one, tens of millenia ago? I don’t think there’s any archaeological evidence to support that.</p>

<p>I think Catholicism is particularly harmful, and personally I believe that the Bible should solely be the moral rule book, and as particularly Catholicism and many parts of Protestantism have nothing to do with the teachings of Jesus in any way, and even are directly opposed in several ways, I hold a certain level of disdain for organised religion in general.</p>
<p>Mark 12 30-31:  "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[a] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] There is no commandment greater than these.”</p>
<p>The thing is, if you love your neighbor, you will not pester them or look down on them for their beliefs or life choices. Certainly you would share your “religion” with them to a point, but never in judgement. “Love the Lord your God” as a priority keeps you from aiding someone or partaking in certain actions deemed “sinful”, but I believe the only people that Christians should criticize for they way they are living are other Christians, and that is only when they are doing something DIRECTLY in opposition to what the Bible says. (IE: don’t harass anyone for playing cards or not wearing a suit to church)</p>
<p>I’m going to leave this where it is for now to prevent myself going off on a major tangent, I’ll add more later possibly. I like where you’ve taken this Bur, and it is interesting to see everyone’s reasons for their own personal beliefs.</p>

          <p>I think the bible actually says that not everyone should focus on trying to spread the Word, and that it’s not for everyone. I know for a fact that it says, if someone doesn’t want to listen to you when spreading the Word, you should kick the dust from your feet and move on.</p>

<p>Depending on which definition of ice age you’re going by, the last was either 260,000,000 or 22,000 years ago. Humans started practicing agriculture about 12,000 years ago.</p>
<p>What exactly are you implying? That there was some sort of lost civilization, more advanced than our current one, tens of millenia ago? I don’t think there’s any archaeological evidence to support that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I mean the one which was its maximum ~20ka, and ended ~12,5ka (shortly before what is considered the start of agriculture).</p>
<p>Not a lost civilization, but simply lost culture, knowledge, technology. More likely it would have been a dispersed, interconnected (to some degree) spectrum of different cultures, traditions, etc. - which makes sense if you consider that man spread out from a small group of individuals.<br>
Not more advanced than us, but advanced in some way, probably overlapping with what we have today in some areas, surpassing it in others, and vice versa.</p>
<p>There is a lot of evidence, at least circumstantial, in the form mostly of megalithic structures, ancient cities, etc. There has been a lot of new discoveries in the past decade. Agriculture has been pushed back, the way it came to be is being reconsidered.</p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>modern man has been around for ~70k years. Before that there were already humans around which were much like us, though there is no (or little) evidence of symbolic thought - which is the main thing which is thought to distinguish us from other/older human species (aside from pure biology/classification).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our planet is a violent place; earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, rising and falling sea-levels, comets and asteroids, …: a lot of opportunity to destroy without a trace much of the fragile objects we leave behind. Several of these events occurred during the past 70k years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even without such violent events, time would dissolve much of what we could have created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stone cannot be dated, only the organic material associated with it; thus, it can only be dated as far back as the oldest organic material left behind demonstrably by humans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in our own history, we went from printing press to internet in about half a millennium, 140 times less than the accepted age of our species; all it takes is a few people having a few ideas, which can then be built on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the accepted rise of agriculture - and other developments - started all around the world in supposedly independent cultures at roughly the same time - shortly after the end of the last ice age I mentioned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the oldest depiction of a sea-worthy vessel is 50k years old and was found in Australia; there is increasing evidence that sapiens colonized the entire world much earlier than thought</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are striking similarities between supposedly independent cultures all around the world; in their architecture, in their myths and stories, in their technology, …; one example is the presence of a certain type of snake worship which exists literally everywhere, for which the oldest evidence found is ~70k years old. (incidentally, its symbolism is strikingly similar to Egyptian symbolism, Christian symbolism, and much more)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>very little is known about the origin of the Egyptian culture. Their king lists go back tens of thousands of years - Egyptologists dismiss it as fantasy. Similar king lists exist for the Sumerians. There is no evidence that the great pyramids were actually built by the pharao it is claimed to be (khafze?), except for some graffiti in a barely accessible part of it, and one vowel of the pharao’s name appearing on the sphynx (the rest having faded away/broken off), with no reference to the actual pyramids. Moreover, the slab of stone it is printed on isn’t part of the original sphynx; which reminds me that the Sphynx has been shown to be at least as old as the last period of heavy rainfall in the area. Also, there is no evidence at all that any of the pyramids, except the later ones (which are of lower quality and complexity), were ever used as tombs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can you image our civilization almost completely disappearing through some global disaster? and the survivors holding on to and preserving a part of what was lost, to be built on again? if so, could it not have happened before?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I could go on for a while here, but I’ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>also, I said plausible, not factual  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

          <p>Well, rot, there are a lot of contradictions in the bible, which is definitely common in a book as long as the bible. But I think is wrong is that people aren’t seeing the bible for what it is: “A book telling of stories to serve as a general moral compass for your personal character to evolve from.” The bible is not something you meticulously analyze and pick apart to guide every aspect of your life. In essence, as I see it, it’s a book that tells you not to be a massive dick, which considering our current state, is still a very relevant message that hasn’t occurred to many people yet.</p>

          <p>The thing is Han, is that when you meticulously pick it apart you come to realize that it <span class="bbcode-i">doesn’t</span> guide every aspect of your life.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  So I simultaneously agree and disagree with your post, I agree that it is a moral compass, but I disagree that you cannot study it to closely. Actually, I think that is where a lot of “Christians” go wrong, is that they don’t take the time to actually read the thing, and end up following whatever wacky tradition someone behind a pulpit tells them is a good idea. They pass this stuff on to other people who don’t actually care enough to find out what is going on, rinse and repeat until you have people praying to mary and the pope and asking humans to forgive their sins, of which they feel the need to keep a meticulous record of. I think the worst thing you can do, is just sit back and not question things.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, I personally have yet to come upon any unexplainable contradictions. I think Pyro is right here, there are some things you need to read in historical context.</p>

<p>About the bible: I very strongly recommend anyone, agnostic, atheistic, christian, or whatever, to watch this video (two parts):<br>
edit: sorry, I meant this video (also two parts, same series):<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnnWbkMlbg&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnnWbkMlbg&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A</a></p>
<p>In fact, that whole series is super interesting and enlightening, whether or not you agree with the guy’s conclusion (atheism). It played a big part in consolidating my stance, and equipped me with some excellent ways to argue for it.</p>
<p>(the series idi posted is also really interesting, it’s a four part BBC documentary about perception, to put it very generally)</p>
<p>After you’ve watched both parts of that video, you should immediately watch this: <a href="https://youtu.be/SB3yo-ZAHAw?t=2m34s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/SB3yo-ZAHAw?t=2m34s</a><br>

          <p>Yes! Imagine how many more libraries or something equivalent could have been destroyed without leaving any written record.<br>
The oldest books we have would have been long gone as well if it wasn’t for careful preservation techniques, and we only started doing that a short while ago.</p>
<p>Another thing which really says a lot: the precession of the equinox, which was only discovered by modern science in the latter half of the 20th century IIRC, is coded into many ancient temples, and myths.</p>
<p>“Your speaking of carbon dating”<br>
I think my wording was a bit confusing. I didn’t mean the actual geological age of stone, that’s not really relevant in archaeology. I meant the age of a stone structure such as a pyramid, or megalithic structures - any manmade structure made of material that isn’t organic and wasn’t crafted, forged, or whatever else allows us to date the age of the actual man-made structure.</p>
<p>A thought which sometimes occurs to me: what if magic is actually an ancient word for electricity which lost its meaning along with the knowledge of electricity  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  it kinda makes sense, magic isn’t so impossible anymore when you have electricity. Just baseless speculation, but a fun thought experiment imo ^^</p>
<p>and after looking it up on wikipedia, it appears electricity has been known about in some form at least since 600BC, and was mostly developed over just 2400 years before a battery had been developed. That’s still about 30 times less time than the existence of our species, plenty of time for this knowledge to have been found and lost.<br>
(although apparently ancient historians said “magush” comes from the name of some tribe)</p>

</aside>
<p>If you read the entire chapters here you will see one is a song of praise about deliverance from Pharaoh, and the other is instruction to the church regarding speaking in tongues. “God is not the author of confusion, but of peace.”, these verses are talking about two entirely different things, two entirely different types of “peace” if you will. I believe the verse in Corinthians, you can use “peace” and “order” interchangeably.</p>

<p>“The Lord is merciful and gracious, <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">slow to anger</span></span>,”.

Jeremiah 7:22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ll get to Genesis 22:2 in a bit, because it doesn’t actually have anything to do with your current point if you read the whole chapter. Have you pulled these off of the first “bible contradictions” google search you found, or are you being ignorant on purpose…?</p>
<p>As for Exodus 29:18, I don’t think this is a matter of God loving burnt offerings, and if you’ll notice that verse never actually says that. Did you ever consider that the smell of roasting cow might just be… nice?  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  I’m just kidding, I think burnt offerings were pleasing to God, in that they were payment for the debts of sin, so not so much the sacrifice, as much as what it signifies.</p>
<p>Jeremiah “22 For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, 23 but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in obedience to all I command you, that it may go well with you.”</p>
<p>Thing is, that burnt offerings were used as atonement for sin. Sin requires payment of life, and in the Old Testament, animal sacrifice was used for that atonement. If you are Christian, you believe that Jesus lived an entirely sinless life for the sole purpose of being “sacrificed” to take on the sins of those who believe just that, making animal sacrifice unnecessary. I believe God did NOT like sacrifice at all, so in order to remove that necessity and still remain true to the rules originally laid out, he sent Jesus who <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> God (if you are Christian) to live sinlessly, thereby being unfit to die, and so, in who’s death, payed for the sins of all who would accept him.</p>

</aside>
<p>22 Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!”</p>
<p>“Here I am,” he replied.</p>
<p>2 Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”</p>
<p>God detests human sacrifice, but it was never God’s intention to have Abraham sacrifice his son. Now I believe that is the King James version? The NIV that I have quoted above uses “tests”, which is very similar but not entirely the same. I personally believe this is meant to test Abraham’s loyalty to God. In the end, God never meant for Abraham to sin, and so prevented Abraham form sacrificing his son. So it still stands true that God has never tempted any man to sin, and would never.</p>

<p>Another thing which really says a lot: the precession of the equinox, which was only discovered by modern science in the latter half of the 20th century IIRC, is coded into many ancient temples, and myths.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Precession has been known and written about for a very, very, very long time. Oddly enough, I just watched a program last week about Isaac Newton who had written about it in the 1600s and included it in his famous books.  Ptolemy was making observations in the second century. It’s not something that came about anywhere near the 20th century.</p>

<p>If you read the entire chapters here you will see one is a song of praise about deliverance from Pharaoh, and the other is instruction to the church regarding speaking in tongues. “God is not the author of confusion, but of peace.”, these verses are talking about two entirely different things, two entirely different types of “peace” if you will. I believe the verse in Corinthians, you can use “peace” and “order” interchangeably.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Order is one of the major definitions of peace. The instructions to the church aren’t strictly about speaking in tongues. It’s about proper worship practices. That’s why the chapter ends with stating that worshipping behaviour is to be done in a orderly manner.  The conflict still remains. He is either the author of peace or he’s a man of war.</p>

<p>This says nothing of how long he stays angered once he has been pushed far enough…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes it does. Psalm 30:5 says exactly how long in it’s first seven words which state:  <span class="bbcode-u">“For his anger endureth but a moment”</span> So, the contradiction remains when Jeremiah 17:4  says “for <span class="bbcode-u">ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever</span>.”</p>

<p>As for Exodus 29:18, I don’t think this is a matter of God loving burnt offerings, and if you’ll notice that verse never actually says that. Did you ever consider that the smell of roasting cow might just be… nice?  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  I’m just kidding, I think burnt offerings were pleasing to God, in that they were payment for the debts of sin, so not so much the sacrifice, as much as what it signifies.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Begin reading at Exodus 25. That’s where it starts with “And the Lord spake unto Moses”.  Exodus 29 is a continuation of what “the Lord” is saying. The atonement for sin is stated in Exodus 29:14 where he says " But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering."    So, it’s precisely laid out that a sin offering is burning a bullock’s flesh and his dung! Read the rest and you’ll find some pretty disturbing instructions on what to do with the animal. Later on he talks about killing a bull each day along with two one year old lambs. Later he tells them that generations to come are to do a burnt offering at the entrance to the tent. It’s rather obvious that God likes burnt offerings isn’t it?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="(rot)(fodder">

 (rot)(fodder:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Thing is, that burnt offerings were used as atonement for sin. Sin requires payment of life, and in the Old Testament, animal sacrifice was used for that atonement.If you are Christian, you believe that Jesus lived an entirely sinless life for the sole purpose of being “sacrificed” to take on the sins of those who believe just that, making animal sacrifice unnecessary. I believe God did NOT like sacrifice at all, (even though he commanded it in Exodus?) so in order to remove that necessity and still remain true to the rules originally laid out, he sent Jesus who <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> God (if you are Christian) to live sinlessly, thereby being unfit to die, and so, in who’s death, payed for the sins of all who would accept him.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You state adamantly that sin requires payment of life. If that’s true then why weren’t Adam and Eve killed for sinning? Or better yet, why didn’t God simply tell them that they could kill a bullock, remove its skin and dung, burn it and that their sins would be forgiven?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God detests human sacrifice, but it was never God’s intention to have Abraham sacrifice his son. Now I believe that is the King James version? The NIV that I have quoted above uses “tests”, which is very similar but not entirely the same. I personally believe this is meant to test Abraham’s loyalty to God. In the end, God never meant for Abraham to sin, and so prevented Abraham form sacrificing his son. So it still stands true that God has never tempted any man to sin, and would never.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Of course it was a test. That’s not the point. The point was that Abraham knew that god liked sacrifices.</p>
<p>You say you use the NIV. Did you know  that the NIV never even existed in its entirety until 1978, that they had added words to it in spite of Revelations 22:18 commanding no one to do that?  You use a book that edited out The deuterocanonical books just like the KJV that did the same thing in the late 1800s? The one that relied on texts from the United Bible Societies that only came into existance in 1946? The one that added the word YOUR to Matthew 13: 32 (then removed it in the 2011 version because of criticism) in order to avoid Jesus speaking a botanical untruth  when Jesus said that the mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds?</p>
<p>In the mean time, here’s a couple more contradictions. I used your NIV this time.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Genesis 32: 30 says: </span>So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because <span class="bbcode-b">I saw God face to face</span>, and yet my life was spared.”<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Yet John 1:18  says:</span> <span class="bbcode-b">No one has ever seen God</span>, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Ezekiel 18:20 says</span> The one who sins is the one who will die. <span class="bbcode-b">The child will not share the guilt of the parent</span>, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child. The righteousness of the righteous will be credited to them, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against them.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Yet Exodus 20:5 states:</span>  You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, <span class="bbcode-b">punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation</span> of those who hate me,</p>

          <p>We can continue this forever, and it will boil down to one of two outcomes each time, you will either give two examples completely ignorant of their context, or I will not take a certain verse literally enough to see a contradiction. Now we could debate every verse in the bible against each other, and be locked in an eternal (now if you take this statement too literally it will be false and upsetting) battle of pedantic and futile struggle, but that seems tiresome and stressful.</p>
