<p>I assume you’re asking my personal religious beliefs. If so, I’m an atheist.</p>
<p>I also assume you’re asking about my personal religious history rather than my life story so…<br>
I have a strong background in religion. I was born, bred and raised in Christianity.</p>
<p>I literally began attending church as an infant. I attended Sunday morning and evening worships, Wednesday night worships, vacation bible schools and was baptized at the age of 12.</p>
<p>I have relatives who are preachers, a grandfather who founded a church at the turn of the 20th century that’s still in existence, have relatives further back in time who were also involved in church leadership and have learned and studied the bible since as far back as I can remember.</p>
<p>I am well versed in Christianic beliefs and its history. I’ve spent numerous hours throughout the years researching its history and the influential people and points in time that effected the spread of Christianity and I understand many of the fascinating events that helped shape Christianity into its current being.</p>
<p>That’s why when you, or others, say that I would speak of the Bible because “I’m ignorant of its context” is really very, very funny. I’m extremely well versed. Well versed enough that I could start a church tomorrow as its preacher.  I suppose your concern is understandable though because of how many people actually do sprout their beliefs without actually knowing the source material, its origins and how its been altered and changed throughout its history.</p>
<p>The people I laugh at the most are those who are literalists. The ones who believe stuff like the great flood actually took place, the ones who believe the earth is only about 6,000 years old. Those are the ones I’d love to run a psychological and IQ test on.</p>

          <p>That is interesting, I kind of expected it to be honest. I’ll assume we just translate things differently. Anyways, I’m going to guess you have a protestant background, probably… baptist?</p>
<p>You’ve been in this thread every single time I’ve come in, in the last two days and the few posts you have made have an air of agitation about them that isn’t present in your usual, pleasant posts elsewhere. From what I’ve seen, <span class="bbcode-i">generally</span> catholics or baptists seem to be to blame for people’s deep rooted… um, distaste, for Christianity in general. If you don’t mind my asking, what happened? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/expressionlessc164.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

          <p>Actually, I don’t find the difference to be varying translations but rather the entire concept.</p>
<p>I was raised neither baptist or catholic. Protestant is probably the closest label because that simply means western Christianity that rejects the authority of the pope.</p>
<p>As far as what happened, the answer is quite simple. I questioned things at an early age that really had no acceptable answer other than basically it was magic. Stuff like who did Adam and Eve’s kids marry? Where did they come from since there’s no mention of them in the Bible? How did Noah get all those animals on the ark? How did they live especially when there was only one small window? What about animals that lived thousands and thousands of miles away? How did he get those?  If everyone on earth died in the great flood then where did human offspring come from? Apparently, incest was ok since everyone else was dead except for Noah’s family. These were questions, as a kid, that had no logical answer. Years later, I studied psychology. With that I was able to understand why humans behave, think and interact the way they do.</p>
<p>How about you? From reading your posts through the years, I would guess that you’re probably in your early to mid 20s, weren’t born into it like I was, but found it later on and are still involved in learning more.</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for the comment that my posts are usually pleasant. I take that as a compliment. Thinking back to my “A Black Mesa Tale Part 2” story maybe I was a little mean to you  but, I had no choice! I hope you read it.</p>

          <p>This is a X-Post from The Rage topic. If you want to respond, respond here. I just wanted to migrate the conversation here:</p>
<p>Sorry guys, my internet connection had gone down for a while.</p>
<p>Essentially, my reasoning for libertarianism is that people should be allowed to do whatever fucked up or great thing they want to do, provide it doesn’t infringe on the established rights of others. Cooperation is great, problem is, as people, we haven’t reached the point where we can put our differences, personal desires, etc aside to deal with bigger issues. At some point, some dumbfuck will come around and take advantage of a fully cooperative society.</p>
<p>Now, a libertarian society does not condone “altruistic” tendencies. In fact, we welcome it. The basis of libertarianism is, after all, voluntary exchange. In a libertarian society, there will be charity groups, much like today, with many privately run non-profit charities. People donate without the input of government right now, so in a libertarian society, it’s not as if all people suddenly become self-absorbed assholes waiting on the next paycheck. The absence of government doesn’t mean that we don’t still feel compassion or sympathy. The point is that people have choice, without the forceful hand of the government (which relies on, lets be honest, the threat of force to achieve means) to dictate what you should or should not do.</p>
<p>Another reason why I’m a libertarian is because I don’t support strong government. Government’s aim is to pass laws, and uses the threat of force to enforce the law. When law surpasses the mere protection of natural rights (don’t kill, steal property, vandalize etc), then it’s either the enforcement of 1. morals or 2. laws that results in personal gain. For the first, morality is subjective, and to enforce a fundamentally subjective idea is the direct violation of someone’s own morality (If your morality is killing people, then that doesn’t apply, as your morality is in direct violation of someone’s natural right). For number 2, it’s using a undisputed position of power for personal motivations, and as we see from countless different points in history, that has ended very poorly.</p>
<p>And I am a fairly avid follower of economics. The problem with a lot of government intervention is, of course, the misallocation of resources. For example the lauded over Scandinavian Health care system is adored by people in the United States. But the reality is, when you phone into the hospital, it often takes months to half a year to get an x-ray, and for people that have serious diseases like cancer, that can mean the difference between life or death. And doctors are often not paid enough in these countries to make up the time spent studying medicine, especially counting the ludicrous 50% tax rates on income. Government just really hasn’t helped in the allocation of health care. And when you look at the numbers for health in the US, the stats are only bad due to cultural habits (like the culture of fast food and a blatant disregard for health in general), and actual figures for treatable and serious diseases are amongst the highest in the world. For a country of 300 million people, that’s impressive. And the US is in this strange limbo zone in medical care where it’s partially private but has many traces of government intervention. Some people call for more government intervention, but I personally think that less government intervention would result in an overall better health care system.</p>
<p>And, to be truthful, I’m not a huge fan of democracy. Sure, it’s great to have democratically leaders, and democratically elected representatives to bring state matters to the attention to the nation and all that jazz. But what democracies usually end up being is a dictatorship of the majority. Especially considering in the US, that split is pretty near 50 50, that means that at one point, 50% of the population is being ruled with the other 50%. And this is with the numerous checks and balances littered in the system. Democracies let the majority’s voice be heard, but the minority, no matter how large, is left in the cold to be pushed around, which I assume many would agree with me to be less than ideal. Libertarians don’t believe in a government, even with the support of the masses, to oppress a minority for thinking different.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m a libertarian, not an anarcho-capitalist. I believe that government, no matter that it’s an evil, is a necessary one. People who are less capable of defending one’s rights should not be at the mercy of his fellow citizens, as that just ends up descending to a government composed of the most ruthless and physically powerful.</p>
<p>This is why I’m a libertarian. I occasionally stray from libertarian principles (I’m an advocate of a voucher system of education rather than a full on privatization, and I do support NASA, even though private companies seem to be taking the initiative right now when it comes to space exploration), but I do value my natural rights over the veneer of security which the government provides.</p>

          <p>Politics does fall under philosophy.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Before I begin, I’m unsure of where my political views lie truly, if I had to pick something it’d have to be lean between moderate republicanism and democratic leanings (in American terms). If someone wants to correct me on that, be my guest.</p>
<p>My views on this topic are based off of my own beliefs and experiences and could vary from yours wildly.</p>

</aside>
<p>Laws are a balance between your rights and how much are you willing to give up. I agree with you, however. In an ideal world, I’d want my government to be as transparent as possible, but it’s fundamentally impossible as it stands today.</p>
<p>You <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> regulation on food, pharmaceuticals, and goods. If it didn’t exist, we’d have quite a larger number of problems with companies. We still have problems with them over here; read up on the coal disaster in WVA (West Virginia). In some cases, these restrictions need to be clamped down even further to ring them in and prevent disasters like those from happening again.</p>
<p>As far as individual rights go, I think the government should be as transparent as possible in these matters, that also goes for philosophical things like Religion. China has that problem as far as religious freedom goes. It’s better than it was in the past (no religion at all), but it’s still got some problems (limiting what someone can talk about in the sermon). No government is perfect. Some are better than others in some things. Mine’s been the most inept for the past 8 years since its inception. That’s pretty fucking sad imo.</p>

<p>People are selfish by nature. The chances of you getting a society like this is astronomical, nigh impossible. Frankly, for that very reason, this is why I’ve supported limited terms for government officials for the past few years. The House and Senate in the US doesn’t have this (yet). It’s why the American people have had so many problems in this matter when dealing with the hardcore conservative republican party. If the American government had something like this, it would limit the damage the trouble makers would be able to do. That said, the American government is at a turn in its history at the moment, our society is evolving faster than the government can keep up with. The same goes for governments across the world, actually.</p>
<p>As far as economic might goes, there are some things that should be regulated by the government. Things like the food supply, water supply, healthcare, and public resources. Those need government regulation. Everyone uses them, therefore they should be the same across the country. As far as private businesses, etc, these shouldn’t be regulated as hard. If you will, ideally a mix between socialism and capitalism would be great on the market.</p>

<p>Everyone’s view on sympathy and compassion is completely different. What may be one thing to you may be another to me. While I agree with you (to some extent), it’s a necessary evil. You <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> order in some form to be able to live in the world you’re in now. Without those laws, what’s to stop someone from shooting you on the spot for an argument that got out of hand? You can’t rely on reason when someone’s in a blind rage. Or what’s to stop your bank from scamming you out of your money? Etc. Those are things that are necessary and put in place for a reason. If they could be modified to be explicit about the conditions in which the law applies, I’d be satisfied.</p>

<p>Up until recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster#United_States" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Filibuster</a> was used extensively by both sides of the government. It was a way for the minority to speak on the matter and prevent the bill from being passed. It was overly used in this congress because of the uncompromising side of both parties. As a result it was removed. If you have irrational government it can become a massive weapon and cause gridlock for months. This was the case in the US around October of 2013, which lead to its removal.</p>

<p>Actually, I don’t find the difference to be varying translations but rather the entire concept.</p>
<p>I was raised neither baptist or catholic. Protestant is probably the closest label because that simply means western Christianity that rejects the authority of the pope.</p>
<p>As far as what happened, the answer is quite simple. I questioned things at an early age that really had no acceptable answer other than basically it was magic. Stuff like who did Adam and Eve’s kids marry? Where did they come from since there’s no mention of them in the Bible? How did Noah get all those animals on the ark? How did they live especially when there was only one small window? What about animals that lived thousands and thousands of miles away? How did he get those?  If everyone on earth died in the great flood then where did human offspring come from? Apparently, incest was ok since everyone else was dead except for Noah’s family. These were questions, as a kid, that had no logical answer. Years later, I studied psychology. With that I was able to understand why humans behave, think and interact the way they do.</p>
<p>How about you? From reading your posts through the years, I would guess that you’re probably in your early to mid 20s, weren’t born into it like I was, but found it later on and are still involved in learning more.</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for the comment that my posts are usually pleasant. I take that as a compliment. Thinking back to my “A Black Mesa Tale Part 2” story maybe I was a little mean to you  but, I had no choice! I hope you read it.</p>

</aside>
<p>I actually was born into Christianity, but I didn’t just accept it because it was there, like I see some people do (particularly Americans it seems, my American relatives are like that and I think it is unhealthy). I’d say that I’ve only really been a Christian in the truest sense of the word very recently though, and I’d say I base my belief on personal experiences all through my life before textbook evidence per se. No “Miracles” in the strictest sense, just ever-present coincidences and eventually some of them surpassed my skepticism.</p>
<p>I guess my personal philosophy could be (directed at no one in particular) “You could be just as wrong as I could be.” I see all through history millions of different views on the world, be they Atheist, Buddhist, Christian, Ancient Egyptian, Greek, etc and I figure, we are probably all wrong to a certain extent. So I go with the truths of what I know. I know it is highly unlikely we will ever know in this lifetime what happened “in the beginning”, whether we all exploded into being from a floaty pencil dot and a puddle of soup, or if there was a garden with two gullible people talking to a reptile, so the topic doesn’t really concern me much. I know from my personal experiences and of those close to me who I trust, that my life has been affected in ways I do not accept as coincidence. I’ve decided to throw my lot in with Jesus’ teachings, and I fully expect that I’m right, but so does everyone, don’t they?</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe one day we’ll all end up discussing this as grasshoppers floating on ethereal weed clouds or whatever crazy garbage those New Agers are getting into these days.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>There were actually three different tales that I had to do because of requests. Unfortunately, they were posted on the site prior to the current one and aren’t visible any more. I’ve thought about re-posting them because of a couple of other inquiries but thought it might appear like I’m an attention whore.</p>
<p>Maybe I should re-post them and just explain that I’ve had some people asking for them and then blame you for being the final one that made me do it again.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <p>People have the capacity of selfishness but also compassion. Basing a political philosophy on only one of those aspects is doomed to fail. What I call human nature is simply a generalization of all of human action, and I admit to that. But it doesn’t detract from the fact that a perfect system like anachro-communism or anachro-capitalism cannot exist with the current way we as humans act.</p>

          <p>I’d say personal experiences that <span class="bbcode-i">solidified</span> my belief.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Mostly just small things that I don’t often remember. Growing up we were a low income family, and mom would always pray if there was a need. There would always be an answer to that need, but I’m not talking about the usual “we always had a job that payed the bills” or stuff like that. I mean like random people coming and saying “I was told to give you this” and giving us the right amount of money to cover what we needed though we never told anyone else about it. Now you could say for skepticism’s sake that maybe these needs slipped out somehow and a friend of a friend whom we never met felt charitable, but recently I’ve been starting to see for myself how God always seems to come through on what he says he will.</p>
<p>The sad thing is when you actually read what the Bible is saying, you find it is speaking out against so many of the practices you find in modern (and medieval) Christianity.</p>
<p>EDIT: I hope this comes out coherently, I’ve got to go right now. Yeah, you can blame me for posting that Black Mesa tale, I love a good read.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
