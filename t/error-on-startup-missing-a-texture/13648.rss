    <title>Error on startup, missing a texture.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/error-on-startup-missing-a-texture/13648</link>
    <description>So I installed BMS yesterday and ran it straight out of the installer, it worked perfectly.  No problems at all.  I installed it to an external drive (which happens to be the same drive that SDK Base &#39;07 is installed to), which meant that Steam refused to place it on the games list even after a restart.  I followed the instructions posted [url=https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=492357&amp;postcount=20]here[/url], and now I&#39;m getting an error message on startup: &quot;Can&#39;t find background image materials/console/startup_loading.vtf&quot;  I checked the folder in question and there is indeed no such texture.  Is this a built-in texture from the SDK base?  If so, could the problem be that I have both BMS and the SDK base installed to an external drive?  If not, uhh...help?
