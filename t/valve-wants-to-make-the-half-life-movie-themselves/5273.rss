    <title>Valve wants to make the Half Life Movie themselves.</title>

    <description>[url]https://www.pcgamer.com/2010/08/26/valve-want-to-make-the-half-life-movie-themselves/[/url]

&quot;Valve’s CEO and co-founder, Gabe Newell, has told PC Gamer that the only way there’d be a Half-Life movie would be if Valve made it themselves. He also said they’ve been experimenting with doing just that.

Tom interviewed the living daylights out of Gabe, and came up with the whole history behind the Half-Life movie – it turns out that they were approached by lots of rubbish proposals for movie cash-ins, and felt that the only creative team that could do it justice was Valve itself. Here’s the full quote from Gabe:

“As a WoW player, I would much rather that the WoW team made the movie, right? Than anybody else. I like Sam Raimi, I’ve been a fan ever since Evil Dead came out, but I would rather see Blizzard making the movie. We think that customers are like, ‘OK, we’re kind of sick and tired of the way you guys are slicing and dicing the experience of being a fan of Harry Potter, or Half-Life, or The Incredibles, and you need to fix it.’ And the people that fix it will be rewarded, and the people that don’t will be on the rubbish heap of history, or whatever the phrase is.

“Where we got into this direction was after Half-Life 1 had shipped. There was a whole bunch of meetings with people from Hollywood. Directors down there wanted to make a Half-Life movie and stuff, so they’d bring in a writer or some talent agency would bring in writers, and they would pitch us on their story. And their stories were just so bad. I mean, brutally, the worst. Not understanding what made the game a good game, or what made the property an interesting thing for people to be a fan of.

“That’s when we started saying ‘Wow, the best thing we could ever do is to just not do this as a movie, or we’d have to make it ourselves.’ And I was like, ‘Make it ourselves? Well that’s impossible.’ But the Team Fortress 2 thing, the Meet The Team shorts, is us trying to explore that.”

This is just the tip of the iceberg of stuff Tom uncovered on his trip to see Valve this month. Our Valve Issue is about to hit shelves and appear in our online shop from the 1st of September – subscribers should be expecting it to materialise in their circle of deadly hero power crystals any day now.&quot;


I believe this is something every video gamer would want from their favorite game company, is for them to make the movies themselves. Since they are the sole creators of said game they&#39;d know what they could take out, leave in and most definitely cast the right people to portray the characters we know and love, instead of some big name who&#39;d just bring in money.

My favorite part of the article is where he says random writers or directors would pitch movie ideas and they would be horrible, which is so true for so many video game-to-movie adaptations, and vice-versa.

If Valve does make a Half-life movie, I&#39;m more than positive it will be good, because they know what they&#39;re doing with their story and because it&#39;s theirs.

I hope to hear more about this in the future.

(also, an update for TF2 and CSS is headed our way in about 45 minutes, or so Valve tells us. Probably engine updates and fixes)</description>

            <p>I would like it if they made 2 Movies out of the saga.<br>
The first one following someone’s escape (or try to escape with being shot in the end) from black mesa with catching a glimpse of gordon crowbaring a soldier.<br>
The second one during hl2/ep1/ep2 showing the escape of some citizens.</p>

            <p>I would love to have Half-Life shorts. Some could be comic (The Adventures of Barney and Kleyner come to mind) and some others action/drama centric. For example one with Alyx as protagonist were we get flashbacks a la Lost of her childhood when she was in Black Mesa and rescued by the gman or even one that covers what happens between EP2 and EP3 (they are going to the Arctic in a chopper and it’s unlikely the game will cover that long travel as we would have to be flying for hours without seeing anything apart from playing a chopper simulator).</p>
<p>BTW, I can’t get copies of PCgamer where I live. Is there any place where I can get scans of this issue?</p>

<p>And this as well. Maybe it’s an enhanced retelling of Blue Shift? Or an overview of the incident with only a few scenes showing Gordon, none of them close up?</p>

<p>It was a dark, dreary day of darkness and dread. The Black Mesa Research Facility has been under attack for 10 minutes. First, people believe the Resonance Cascade is only bringing in aliens from another dimension… But in a blink of an eye, it goes down even further into the depths of the fierce hell fire. A new enemy wanders into the rift, an enemy far more threatening than the invading aliens or the soon-to-be arriving H.E.C.U. An enemy that pushes our hero, Gordon Gerard Freeman, into such a predicament that he mutters his first words… “I’ve had enough of this shit. Time to kick ass and chew bubble gum. It appears I can currently do both for at least a few hours… Until I’m all out of gum.” This enemy, so horrid, so vile, isn’t really just one enemy… But two. The locust… And the Covenant. Gordon-"</p>
<p>That’s as far as the guy got. I think.</p>

            <p>you know, a half life movie would be weird, maybe i don’t know much, but i dont see movies with silent protagonists all that often. And if they gave him a voice that would just be the start of something bad</p>

            <p>No movie in sight, but at least we can be sure they won’t let Uwe Boll or Shyamaladingdong or Michael “BOOM” Bay fuck it up.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Maybe a spinoff made by nolan, he didn’t make any bad(ly rated) movies so far.</p>
