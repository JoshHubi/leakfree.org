    <title>HUD post process is enabling itself back with every relaunch of the game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hud-post-process-is-enabling-itself-back-with-every-relaunch-of-the-game/15155</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t like to play with post process enabled in hud. So I decided to disable it. The problem is, that it enables itself back, every time when I close and launch the game again. Hope it&#39;s fixable.</description>
