    <title>Great Games to Play</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/great-games-to-play/8135</link>
    <description>So I was searching for some great games to for me to get, so I looked around the internet, and decided to come up with this list, which acts as a checklist of sorts for me, as well as a recommendation list for others if they are interested.  So the main point of this thread is if any of you have recommendations of some great games, or just feedback in general, such as your opinions on the ones on the list, any essential mods, etc.  post them here.  I might update it with any new ones I forgot.

I got quite a few of these from antisocialfatman (for those who haven&#39;t heard of him, he&#39;s a very good reviewer, he died earlier this month, but you should check him out nonetheless.)   [url]https://www.youtube.com/user/antisocialfatman#g/p[/url]

<p>I didn’t mention UT99 cuz that’s a given once you find out about unreal in any form.</p>
<p>Also, i remember Nox. Very little, some caves with lava - also i remember i was impressed how when you walked through a door the shadows would come from it as if you were the light source, and I remember seeing a guy get sucked into a TV, and a hot air balloon. That’s about it.</p>

            <p>I see that a lot of my favorite games have already been mention. Here’s a few that haven’t been mentioned yet. Clive Barker’s Undying, the ending sucks but the build-up to it is good. Nox, a Diablo clone with a quirky sense of humor. Torchlight is OK too although it seemed kind of short.</p>

<p>It outrages me to see that no one has mentioned Unreal and Unreal Tournament(99).</p>
<p>I also really liked UT2004, come at me bros. It needs some mods, nothing in particular though, just stuff to make it interesting. One really good one for it is Ballistic weapons.</p>
<p>UT3 was fun too, but there was only one good map in the whole game, VCTF-Suspense.</p>
<p>EDIT: The Riddick games are great, and highly recommended. I did a quest in Skyrim that was pretty Butcher Bay, and I was all :awesome:.</p>

<p>Its more of a pricing thing, I don’t particularly care for graphics, and assault on dark athena costs around $20-30 more where I live, and I can’t get it on amazon or ebay from my location.</p>

            <p>I have some questions, do you guys recommend Assault on Dark Athena, or should I just get Escape from Butcher Bay.  I know that they upgraded Butcher Bay with better lighting and crap, but how does Dark Athena stack up to the original?</p>
<p>Is there any game on that list that is bad and shouldn’t be included, because I intend to go on a “best of the best” videogame spree at some point.</p>
<p>Also Please don’t try just to list whatever game comes to your head, or your favorite game, list the games that you believe can be considered “great”  of course its always going to be an opinion, but do give it some thought.</p>

            <p>I’ve played since year one, on and off of course, but I used to do endgame raiding heavily, I PvP’d seriously, and I would just fuck around with my friends and do exploits and glitches all the time. It’s a great, fun game, but I am starting to get burned out, 7 years is a bit much for me, and Cata and Wotlk have been lackluster compared to TBC imo, but it’s still a great game.</p>

            <p>WoW is legitmately fun in moderation to me. I can’t play it for hours/days on end like some people can without brushing with death out of boredom, but it’s not a bad game. And it’s an unbelievably well-designed game, it wouldn’t still be around after 7 years and completely destroy all of its competition if it wasn’t. People who say WoW is shit are people who have never tried it, typically, or just don’t like MMOs, because out of all of the MMOs I’ve played, WoW is the only good one, imo.</p>

            <p>WoW is a good game if you don’t suck, I’m guessing you did Mab.</p>
<p>Minecraft is also a really great game, but it depends on the person who plays it, some people can’t stand it, millions love it.</p>
