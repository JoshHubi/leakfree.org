    <title>First chapter, big elevator -&gt; no headcrabs [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/first-chapter-big-elevator-no-headcrabs-fixed/9789</link>
    <description>Well, i missed them.
There was only one headcrap before i started the elevator. I killed it and used the elevator. But then there are no headcraps falling down on the elevator.
When the elevator was down his way there where no headcraps and enemies too.

Kinda frustrating.</description>

            <p>Yup, they appeared at first, then I died (I have a hangover, so wasn’t at my best!), then when I started again, no headcrabs appeared.</p>

            <p>I was reloading this section to get through it with as little as damage as possible and the headcrabs were raining on me, so to speak.</p>
<p>On one of the times i stayed hurdled in button facing left side of the platform. no headcrabs loaded that time</p>
<p>Dunno what caused it but I am just reporting it</p>

            <p>I got no headcrabs, either. I saw them spawn at the top of the slope, but they simply walked back into the room above and never attempted to jump down at me.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there’s an extra bug with this: The music that plays is tied to pressing the button, but you can press the button multiple times on the way down and the music restarts each time. I believe the button should become inert as soon as it’s pressed the first time so that it can’t be touched while the elevator is moving. Either that, the music should be prevented from restarting itself. It’s supposed to be background mood and it comes off like it’s playing in the PA system.</p>
<p>That’s actually the only obvious bug I’ve seen.</p>
