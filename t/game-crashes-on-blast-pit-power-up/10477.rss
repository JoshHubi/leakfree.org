    <title>Game Crashes on Blast Pit/Power Up?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-on-blast-pit-power-up/10477</link>
    <description>So I installed Black Mesa yesterday night and played through it till who knows the time of night. And got to Blast Pit. I defeated the tentacles and saved it while climbing down the ladder where the tentacles died. I saved my game and the next day (today), I went around all the radioactive pipes, turned the valve to replace the HUGE missing pipe and jump across.

At THAT loading screen (which i believe may be the loading screen to the next level, Power Up) the game just crashes.

I&#39;ve tried restarting the game and restarting the computer. Every time I restart the game and loaded and retried (which after about 5 tries i saved it RIGHT before the loading point) it kept crashing, about 6 times and then I gave up.

Any help here? Maybe I got a bad file or perhaps I&#39;m just SOL and may have to restart the level? :fffuuu:

I put a screenshot of the loading point in the attachment.

EDIT: Just figured out that the game crashes WHENEVER I load. I started a new game on Blast Pit and the game crashed after loading the next area.
