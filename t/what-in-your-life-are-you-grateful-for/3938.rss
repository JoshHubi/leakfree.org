    <title>What in your life, are you grateful for?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-in-your-life-are-you-grateful-for/3938</link>
    <description>For me, there are many, many things. Part of where this comes from, is I had a buddy who recently died from cancer. While he was still alive, there were a bunch of us having coffee. There was this one guy who bitches about every stupid pathetic, little thing. He complains and rarely finds the good in things. Santos looks over at him and says, &quot;I am about to die - do you really think that what you are bitching at, is worth investing your life in? Life is too short, take it from me.&quot; Santos died shortly after. So, tragedy aside, what are you grateful for?

Just for bones, photography.

What are some of yours?</description>

<p>Thank God (Whatever God there may be - Being as this is a female oriented comment, does it seem reasonable to mention Hestia?) They do still exist.</p>

<p>you assume that I had pity for people with a life like that.</p>
<p>it is humanly impossible to deduce whose life is worse than whose but somewhere, weather it is starving on a mat in the middle of africa or sitting in an office chair with paperwork stacked high, there is someone who’s life sucks more ass than anyone else in the world.</p>

<p>An American businessman went on a vacation to coastal Africa, where he met a fisherman. And asked him “What do you do during your day?”</p>
<ul>
<li>“I wake up in the morning, around 9, go to the sea, catch 2 or 3 fish, then go home around 11, give the fish to my wife, and she cooks them. And I spend the rest of my day sitting on the beach, watching kids play, enjoy the sun and warmth…”</li>
<li>“But, if you woke up 2 hours earlier, you could catch 3 times as much fish!”</li>
<li>“Yeah? And what would I do with all that fish?”</li>
<li>“Well, you could sell the surplus fish on the market and make some money.”</li>
<li>“Yeah, and then what?”</li>
<li>“Well, you could hire few fishermen, who would go fishing with you, and then you could catch 10 times more fish and sell those too, and make even more money!”</li>
<li>“Yeah? And then what?”</li>
<li>“With all that money, you could buy a new boat, and make two fishing trips instead of one, and catch even more fish and make even more money!”</li>
<li>“Yeah? And then what?”</li>
<li>“Well, if you continued expanding like this, soon you’d be a director of a huge fishing company, and would earn huge amounts of money!”</li>
<li>“Yes? And then what?”</li>
<li>“Well, one day, you will be able to retire, buy yourself a nice house on the beach, and just sit on a chair, watch the kids play, enjoy the sun and warmth…”</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no chain. It’s a circle. We pity poor chinese farmers, working hard on their rice fields… And they pity us for our stressful lives, our divorce rates…</p>
