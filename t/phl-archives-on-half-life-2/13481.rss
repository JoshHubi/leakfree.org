    <title>PHL Archives on Half-Life 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/phl-archives-on-half-life-2/13481</link>
    <description>Since Planet Half-Life is no longer the site I remember, and has declined a bit (it hasn&#39;t updated for two years), I thought I should revisit the past which I remembered fondly. 

Which brings me to this awesome April Fool&#39;s joke they did back in the ancient era of 1999. I think Fragmaster wrote this. There are some crude concept art, and some in-game screenshots (which are stated by the author to be really old screenshots of what the Gunmen Chronicles was originally going to be, which was a mod for Quake 2). Better check it out for yourself.

[url=&#39;https://web.archive.org/web/20000816004906/https://www.planethalflife.com/features/articles/hl2prev/&#39;]https://web.archive.org/web/20000816004906/https://www.planethalflife.com/features/articles/hl2prev/[/url]

The mailbag response to the article is also pretty humorous. 

[url=&#39;https://web.archive.org/web/20000831031738/https://planethalflife.com/community/mailbag/mailbag40499.shtm&#39;]https://web.archive.org/web/20000831031738/https://planethalflife.com/community/mailbag/mailbag40499.shtm[/url]

Even though it&#39;s a joke, I think that a screwy retelling of Half-Life with Deerman as the main character would make for a really wacky mod, for Goldsource or Source. It would be like if Half-Life incorporated a bit of The Tick and other underground comics into its universe. If I had to develop the story some more, I would have it that Deerman was a mistake resulting from the crypto-genetics branch of Black Mesa, and somehow escaped to do battle with the forces of Xen and other dimensions. He might use the antlers on his head for a weapon when he doesn&#39;t have a crowbar

And here&#39;s another link for one of PHL&#39;s old mailbag sessions, in which the fans submitted their own ideas for Half-Life 2&#39;s story (long, long before Half-Life 2&#39;s announcement). Some of the ideas are downright creative, though it is funny to see how many of us then thought that Xen was the only threat before the official Half-Life 2 came out.

<p>EDIT: Also you said they were from the Gunman Chronicles? I picked up the original CD-ROM version of the game at a garage sale a couple years back; purely due to the fact that it used the goldsrc engine and was therefore pretty much just a mod for HL1. Never actually played it though… can’t imagine what the beta of it would look like lol.</p>

<p>They are from what Gunman Chronicles originally was supposed to be, which was a mod for Quake 2. Fragmaster explains it in the mailbag.</p>

<p>Yeah, in case you missed it, those test level screens were from the Gunman TC, but those particular shots are actually really, really, really, old Q2-engine shots.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I rather liked those screenshots, even if players thought they were too old.</p>

<p>Try clicking on them. You’ll see them better that way. It happened to me too, though when I clicked on them to see the bigger image, they appeared clearly.</p>

            <p>You should play it. It’s fun, imo, if a little bit cheesy. And yeah, I can’t imagine the beta on that haha</p>
