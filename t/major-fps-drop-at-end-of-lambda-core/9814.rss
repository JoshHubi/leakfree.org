    <title>Major FPS drop at end of Lambda Core</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/major-fps-drop-at-end-of-lambda-core/9814</link>
    <description>The final battle at the end of Lambda Core (where they&#39;re opening the portal to Xen) is horribly laggy for me, dropping down below 15 FPS. I was able to play through the rest of the game without noticing any FPS drops at all.

GPU: Radeon HD 5870
CPU: Intel i5 2500K
Ram: 16GB
OS: Windows 8 Release Preview

Settings: All maxed, no motion blur, VSync on, 1680x1050 fullscreen

I also tried lowering most of the settings, it didn&#39;t seem to have much of an effect on the FPS.

Other than that I had a hell of a lot of fun playing it.  :smiley:</description>

            <p>It’s in the frakkin’ ship! The nicer the effect, the more particles rendered it seems, as to not look like generic round particles.<br>
Spamming the particles and decals was what causes the drop.<br>
I first noticed it while blood decals were gushing out of a gibbed creature, and only while looking at it.</p>
<p>I guess I’ll have to p*ssy my way through the tough part of the fight, I’m at it right now and the drop is making Hard - Insane…<br>
(awesome dash jump manouverability due to slo-mo, though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  )</p>

            <p>Strange… I’ve got a Radeon HD 4600 and there was only ever an FPS drop during just before the portal bit, with all the lasers and such, and that was only a small one. Also noticing pretty much everyone who mentions having the problem has an ATI card. Maybe Source doesn’t like those?</p>

            <p>Same here, with a Radeon 4850. AMD cards seem to be a recurring theme.</p>
<p>As <span class="hashtag">#4</span> said, the trigger seemed to be creating and loading a save once the effects had started up. Smooth on 1920x1080 4AA /8AF everywhere else. Dropping down to 1280x720, 0AA / Trilinear didn’t make a difference.</p>

            <p>This is, from what I can tell, a problem with the Source engine itself. Particle effects and glowing materials seem to always cause massive FPS drops on it, even with the lowest settings.</p>

            <p>Happened to me too.  FPS was gorgeous all the way up to there.  But it didn’t drop until I died and I quick loaded, as others have mentioned.  I have a Core i7 2600k, Sapphire Radeon 7870, and 8gb memory.  I don’t remember if they did this, but if they haven’t, the devs should consider making this area its own map.  And consider toning down the particle affects as well.  It’s definitely not a hardware problem, it’s a Source 2007 problem.  Maybe Valve will be nice enough to give them a license to fix stuff like that in the future.  Surely they’ll be taking interest in this mod.</p>

            <p>Just posted in another thread regarding this but yeah I had the same issue. Everything prior to the final battle went silky smooth but whenever the portal to Xen opened up it became unbearable and almost unplayable.</p>
<p>Played with everything maxed with 2X AA, 16X AF, HDR on, Bloom on, V-Sync off at 1920x1080.</p>
<p>My specs if it matters:<br>
Intel Core i5-2500K CPU 3.30GHz<br>
4GBRAM<br>
ATI Radeon HD 5850 1024MB</p>

<p>I had the same problem, I found that if I saved at any point during the portal opening cycle and then loaded that save the FPS would drop to 10-15fps and nothing I tried would fix it. Loading from the autosave point when you first enter the room seemed to work though.</p>

<p>Had this as well, once i loaded a save it got much worse.</p>

            <p>same processor, same graphic card, 8gb memory, i had the same problem (the framerate drop only occurred when looking toward the rays)</p>
<p>also, the ray coming vertically from the teleporter was ‘hidden’ behind it’s source, it was not coming from it’s center.</p>
