    <description>This is something rather bizarre I&#39;ve noticed with Black Mesa, the soldiers do not move their lips or anything when they speak.
For example when a soldier exclaims &quot;No sign of hostiles sir, over!&quot; his mouth remains shut the entire time and makes no indication that he is speaking. They do move their mouth when they say things like &quot;GET DOWN&quot; but it seems that their face posing doesn&#39;t cover random, idle chatter.</description>

<p>Well the majority of them have masks so I haven’t really noticed too much, since I usually kill the Commanders and Medics before they get too close.</p>

<p>Precisely. I’m never close enough to their faces to notice, unless I’m about to die or doing a suicide run.</p>
