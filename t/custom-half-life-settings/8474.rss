    <title>Custom Half Life settings</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/custom-half-life-settings/8474</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if it has been done yet here, but as I recently created my personnal configuration for Half Life which gives me satisfaction, I thought it would be a good idea to open a thread and share it, and share yours if you have one.

So the idea is to change, by the console commands, the damages caused by some weapons and the health of some ennemies. Of course, doing that manually each time you launch the game would be very annoying, so the commands are packed in a cfg file. 
Just put the file in C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\*user*\half-life\valve and, each time you launch the game, you only have to load a map, 
type &quot;exec *name of the file*.cfg&quot; in the console, reload a map and that&#39;s it.

This way you can drastically change the gameplay. Personnally I missed a &quot;hardcore&quot; mode for HL: in the hard mode the ennemies could just withstand a large amount of damage, which I find unrealistic and not very fun. So I made my own &quot;harcore&quot; mode, in which I increase a lot the damages made by conventional weapons and alien attacks, as well as the aliens health. I also drastically reduced the health given by medipacks and health chargers.
As a result, I find the gunfights more intense and more realistic (especially against the human grunts).
That, plus forcing myself to quicksave only one or two times per level (depending of the length of the level) greatly improves the game experience.

I give you my cfg file if you want to test it:

            <p>Since we are on the topic of configs, does anyone know how to make the recoil on the mp5 match the original half-life? They seriously messed up the feel of it by adding the jerky up and down motions with it in source. Is there a console command?</p>

            <p>Yeah, I played Metro2033 in hard mode too, I liked how you died as soon as you made a mistake, or almost. It’s a great and very immersive game, anyway.</p>
<p>Also, the realistic mode in Far Cry was excellent as well.</p>

            <p>i’m liking this<br>
however, i think metro2033 nailed the difficulty</p>
<p>the more difficult you set the game, the more damage weapons do to everyone<br>
for example, on easy mode you can take an insane amount of damage, as well as your foes, but on hard mode, both you and the foe are 1 shot kills</p>
<p>of course, metro 2033 =/= half life, but you get the idea</p>

<p>Is that irony?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>If it’s not, then I’m glad I allowed other peoples to enjoy the different gameplay and maybe go through HL again, but I’m kind of surprised nobody shared the idea before, I mean most of us are diehard HL fans who have been through the game a dozen times or more, right?</p>
