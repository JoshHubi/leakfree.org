<p>If we go by the logic of ‚Äújust because it wasn‚Äôt there, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs impossible for it to exist‚Äù for every silly idea we might as well add in Link from Legend of Zelda as a side companion who got stuck in Xen or something, cause as long as it looks cool, who cares about logic. I‚Äôm not saying new ideas are bad, I‚Äôm saying things have to make sense in the context of the world you‚Äôre building.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>lmao what? That is a literal strawman argument right there. No, adding Link would not make sense, because it does not fit into the world of Half-Life. Adding HEV Zombies does fit into the world of Half-Life. It really is that simple.<br>
((((No it‚Äôs not, I went with an extreme example, but the point stands, if your world has rules, you should follow them, anything that goes against the rules of your world by definition doesn‚Äôt make sense in your world and won‚Äôt fit. Metal is hard, headcrabs have no teeth or acid secretion to eat away at the metal, even if they did, it would take too long and the scientist being attacked by the headcrab would have plenty of time to remove it))))</p>

</aside>
<p>Kind of besides the point. He is clearly talking about Half-Life 1, not Decay.There were no female scientists in Half-Life 1. No, the hologram doesn‚Äôt count, because the hologram being Gina Cross is a retcon that didn‚Äôt exist back in 1998.</p>
<p>((((The hologram counts because A: She has to work in the facility to record that training and B: It was part of the original which is an official game made by Valve and to date I haven‚Äôt seen a HL game that that retcons her training recording mostly because it would make no sense to retcon something like that anyway. The fact that you don‚Äôt even know HL1 had a female scientist kind of puts your validity into question, the fact that a DEVELOPER of Black Mesa doesn‚Äôt know that is even more scary.))))</p>

<p>I‚Äôd go a step further and say you didn‚Äôt go far enough, instead of creating something new you just created a variation of an existing enemy, instead of making a new alien you made a variation of the houndeye, you could have put a charger in there and had your own spin on it, but you just remodeled a houndeye and tweaked the effects. Black Mesa always struck me as a game that never knew what it wanted to be, it never wants to be the original but it also never has the balls to break away from the original and actually do something new, it just stays in the middle.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don‚Äôt get it. Black Mesa Xen is almost <em>nothing</em> like Half-Life Xen, they tried something new literally at every corner, and here you are complaining about them not having revived a cut creature from Half-Life 1? Besides, wouldn‚Äôt reviving the charger would have been just copying old ideas?! I don‚Äôt understand this line of reasoning at all. Also, Textfamguy literally already answered your last question there. Black Mesa tries to stick as closely to Half-Life <em>where it makes sense</em>. It‚Äôs  basically a reimagination of Half-Life if Valve made it in the current day. Keep what works, maybe add some new elements here and there, throw out what doesn‚Äôt work.<br>
TLDR: It‚Äôs beyond me why people are stuck up on these minute details that make barely any difference at all, instead of just accepting that CC have taken some artistic liberties with what is their OWN version of Half-Life Xen. It‚Äôs ridiculous.</p>
<p>(((( I‚Äôm not complaining, I‚Äôm giving my opinion, not everything that goes against the herd is a complaint. I gave the cut creature as an example, doesn‚Äôt mean they have to implement exactly that. It‚Äôs very obvious that the HL community can‚Äôt create new things, they either just go with what HL1 and 2 had or they use cut beta content because anything knew to them wouldn‚Äôt fit in with the series. It still would have been better than just a houndeye reskin with slight tweaks though, after all that is what he stated their goal was, to create something new (that wasn‚Äôt in the first game), yet they just recycle.</p>
<p>Using the excuse that they stick close ‚Äúwhere it makes sense‚Äù literally makes no sense because a lot of the changes made in BM wouldn‚Äôt need to be there by that logic. The marines never had to sound so annoying, the bullsquid never needed that binocular vision redesign with that ‚Äúoh look how scary I am by showing my sharp teeth constantly‚Äù design, On a rail never had to be cut, Xen never had to have 70 different color palettes and earthly looking flora there. Yes it makes sense to improve upon gameplay but the visuals were purely subjective, they never had to change those because there was nothing that ‚Äúmade sense‚Äù to be fixed. No, I‚Äôm not complaining about the looks of Xen but using the ‚Äúwhen it makes sense‚Äù for such subjective changes is illogical. Which part of changing the position of the bullsquids eyes made sense? It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI made the vorts green cuz it makes sense‚Äù. Fixing bugs makes sense, I tell ya that.</p>
<p>Also the devs like to tout BM like a reimagining, but really apart from Xen what is actually reimagined? It remade the levels, it made the enemies HD and tweaked them a bit, the voice acting is new, the guns are tweaked, it‚Äôs a remake. There are no new subplots, new characters, aliens, guns, the areas are pretty much the same but with slight alterations and prettier graphics. Doom 3 is a reimagining, it takes Doom 1‚Äôs story but other than that it‚Äôs completely different. Serious Sam HD tweaked enemy health, damage, made the levels HD, tweaked the AI a bit, is that a reimagining? No it‚Äôs a remake, so is Black Mesa. If Black Mesa was a true reimagining people wouldn‚Äôt constantly confuse it for a remake because it would be obvious that it‚Äôs different. As I said, the devs like to pride themselves on changing things but apart from visuals, slight level layout changes, and the reinventing of Xen‚Äôs maps, what is there that is different? Are they going to introduce new to Half Life creatures? New weapons and mechanics? New characters?</p>
<p>No need to argue more here, especially to someone who doesn‚Äôt even know basic things about HL1. Also yes, I didn‚Äôt separate the replies, I can‚Äôt be bothered : P))))</p>

<p>What this basically means, is that you and I have very different visions about what Black Mesa should be, and your idea isn‚Äôt the one that we are making. And that‚Äôs okay - but you‚Äôre arguing a point which comes from that place that we simply can‚Äôt agree with.</p>
<p>I mean, you saw the Xen Trailer, right? Sticking closely to the original is already WAY out of the window at this point. Sticking closely to the original was basically never the point of this project; it‚Äôs our own spin on the original. There‚Äôs no point simply remaking the original. The original can‚Äôt be topped at what it does, and it still exists. It‚Äôs a masterpiece of gaming history, warts and all. That‚Äôs the original, authentic HL experience. This is our take on it. We stick close to the original where it makes sense and benefits the game. which is a lot of the time. This particular point? Doesn‚Äôt really matter that much. The gameplay benefit and variety that comes from the HEV zombies is worth more than potentially worrying about a small break in canon.</p>
<p>I highly doubt that Valve ever intended that the HEV suit provides the user immunity from Headcrabs, and we‚Äôre not in the habit of making illogical assumptions based on unstated facts. The original HL had only scientist zombies. Did this mean that Guards and Soldiers were immune to Headcrabs, just like the HEVs were? That‚Äôs the same logic, is it not? There also weren‚Äôt female scientists in the original - we have those too. Is that too far for you as well? Did Valve intend for the researchers at BMS to be 100% male?</p>
<p>You probably accept those latter 2 things, because they just make sense. HEV Zombies also just make logical sense, you just don‚Äôt like that because it contradicts your notion of canonicity. And it‚Äôs fine for you to not like it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we have to adapt the game to fit that. Nor does it mean it‚Äôs a bad idea/doesn‚Äôt make sense.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat this basically means, is that you and I have very different visions about what Black Mesa should be, and your idea isn‚Äôt the one that we are making. And that‚Äôs okay - but you‚Äôre arguing a point which comes from that place that we simply can‚Äôt agree with.‚Äù I really disagree with this and it probably says that you didn‚Äôt even get where my vision about Black Mesa is. My vision lies exactly there, where it is now in the released state, so your ‚Äúvery different vision‚Äù statement is invalid. I appreciate the game development how it is and I was always stunned how correct it is to my liking, I would do it the same, if I could!<br>
‚ÄúSticking closely to the original is already WAY out of the window at this point. Sticking closely to the original was basically never the point of this project; it‚Äôs our own spin on the original. There‚Äôs no point simply remaking the original.‚Äù I disagree again, because it actually is sticking to original, it was point of the project and remaking the original has a point as it is a todays trend to remake original games. What is not that sticking to original is maybe Project Lambda and even this can‚Äôt be considered as ‚ÄúFAR AWAY‚Äù from it. Many things which in default setting doesn‚Äôt correspond to original have it‚Äôs ticks in Options menu which could make the gameplay more similar to HL1. Those are for instance: Always Run, Iron sights, View roll, etc. Even the newer shotgun model was changed so it corresponds more to HL1 model!!! (although I like here more the first SPAS model, but I have it replaced back via Workshop, problem solved!) How could you say it‚Äôs WAY out from original I don‚Äôt know. Xen might be different, but it is great it‚Äôs different in this part, because it matches todays players graphical demands, and it is the exact part where you can express your lvl dsgn art and creativity, sticking here with the original cave-like design may just wouldn‚Äôt be enough.<br>
And to rest of your post‚Ä¶ doubts or no doubts‚Ä¶look‚Ä¶<br>
There will be always 100 reasons from you that will defend your HEV zombie idea, and there will be 100 reasons from me or the others offending the idea.  And exactly because of this, I find it QUESTIONABLE. And because it‚Äôs questionable, please, make it optional as the other features. You already have a Black Mesa bookmark in the options. Scripting it optional and put Grunt or other NPC‚Äôs instead shouldn‚Äôt be that hard I believe. You will make me, and I believe lot of other people happy. You guys made a lot of work and cared about many details, and this is a last detail that should be dealed to create an outstanding remake.</p>

<p>Agreed, but that opens another question. When are humans still alive? If a body is not functional anymore but brain is still working? Or if brain is dead, but body is still functional?<br>
I think that headcrab can adapt to both scenarios. If the brain is still intact, it could provide some basic memories, reflexes or habits.</p>

<p>At least with the zombine the host is completely alive, you can hear the zombine calling warnings over the radio that they are infected. And the grenade pull is suspected to be a suicide move. It is belived that this is because the brains of the combine are replaced with robotic parts in a safer location then the head as the head is a weak point.</p>
<p>As for standard zombies it is a toss up I would say some might be still alive living a horror as this creature mutates their body and eats other people using it, while most are more or less killed by the crab. Though The way the games play the zombies especially in two it leans more on the. Living hell as a parasite controls your body side. But it is left vague so we can infer what we want. I don‚Äôt think there has been a word of god or cannon explanation.</p>

          <p>What exactly are you envisioning? A setting in the options menu reading ‚ÄúHEV Zombies On/Off‚Äù? Why not include every NPC type while you‚Äôre at it, so players can <span class="bbcode-i">really customize</span> their experience?</p>
<p>Do you understand how ridiculous it would get if developers took time to make every little thing that was at all controversial an optional part of the game? For instance, I prefer the look and sounds of vortigaunts from the original HL‚Ä¶ maybe they should make that an option too? Oh wait, there‚Äôs a mod for that. Maybe that‚Äôs what mods are for‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I just don‚Äôt like this addon, seems weird to me, lol. Gordon with HEV is somehow resistant to crabz attach. Scientists on XEN wears helmets, so wtf. I don‚Äôt even remember this from the original game. Any chance making this feature optional? Replacing NPC‚Äôs with other creatures? I am quite conservative in this way. Perhaps it is just a detail that players don‚Äôt mind, but maybe they do. What do you think?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you really don‚Äôt like the addition of the HEV zombie, I suggest you mod the game when it gets released. It‚Äôs really the easier route. I personally like the idea, and, if at first glance it doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense, I try to find a way for it to make sense, just as others have suggested. I suggest you do the same. Many things in this game don‚Äôt make sense, because it is just that, a game. Try to view this new addition as an opportunity instead of being offended by it. You know what? When <em>Black Mesa</em> first came out, I got pretty disappointed because I was expecting many things to be just like <em>Half-Life</em> and they turned out to be really different; but over the years I learned to like it, and now I love it.</p>
