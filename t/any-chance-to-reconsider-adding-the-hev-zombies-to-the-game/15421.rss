    <description>I just don&#39;t like this addon, seems weird to me, lol. Gordon with HEV is somehow resistant to crabz attach. Scientists on XEN wears helmets, so wtf. I don&#39;t even remember this from the original game. Any chance making this feature optional? Replacing NPC&#39;s with other creatures? I am quite conservative in this way. Perhaps it is just a detail that players don&#39;t mind, but maybe they do. What do you think?</description>

<p>If you really don’t like the addition of the HEV zombie, I suggest you mod the game when it gets released. It’s really the easier route. I personally like the idea, and, if at first glance it doesn’t seem to make sense, I try to find a way for it to make sense, just as others have suggested. I suggest you do the same. Many things in this game don’t make sense, because it is just that, a game. Try to view this new addition as an opportunity instead of being offended by it. You know what? When <em>Black Mesa</em> first came out, I got pretty disappointed because I was expecting many things to be just like <em>Half-Life</em> and they turned out to be really different; but over the years I learned to like it, and now I love it.</p>

            <p>What exactly are you envisioning? A setting in the options menu reading “HEV Zombies On/Off”? Why not include every NPC type while you’re at it, so players can <span class="bbcode-i">really customize</span> their experience?</p>
<p>Do you understand how ridiculous it would get if developers took time to make every little thing that was at all controversial an optional part of the game? For instance, I prefer the look and sounds of vortigaunts from the original HL… maybe they should make that an option too? Oh wait, there’s a mod for that. Maybe that’s what mods are for…</p>

<p>One thing I love about some developers is they are inaccessible in arguments and must be always right, no matter to actual sense or better solution. Your signature says it all, Chris.<br>

<p>Agreed, but that opens another question. When are humans still alive? If a body is not functional anymore but brain is still working? Or if brain is dead, but body is still functional?I think that headcrab can adapt to both scenarios. If the brain is still intact, it could provide some basic memories, reflexes or habits.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>At least with the zombine the host is completely alive, you can hear the zombine calling warnings over the radio that they are infected. And the grenade pull is suspected to be a suicide move. It is belived that this is because the brains of the combine are replaced with robotic parts in a safer location then the head as the head is a weak point.</p>
<p>As for standard zombies it is a toss up I would say some might be still alive living a horror as this creature mutates their body and eats other people using it, while most are more or less killed by the crab. Though The way the games play the zombies especially in two it leans more on the. Living hell as a parasite controls your body side. But it is left vague so we can infer what we want. I don’t think there has been a word of god or cannon explanation.</p>
<p>And we are not going to be getting any new valve lore from half life until HL VR, which seems like it is just showing the creamators are canon.</p>

<p>What this basically means, is that you and I have very different visions about what Black Mesa should be, and your idea isn’t the one that we are making. And that’s okay - but you’re arguing a point which comes from that place that we simply can’t agree with.</p>
<p>I mean, you saw the Xen Trailer, right? Sticking closely to the original is already WAY out of the window at this point. Sticking closely to the original was basically never the point of this project; it’s our own spin on the original. There’s no point simply remaking the original. The original can’t be topped at what it does, and it still exists. It’s a masterpiece of gaming history, warts and all. That’s the original, authentic HL experience. This is our take on it. We stick close to the original where it makes sense and benefits the game. which is a lot of the time. This particular point? Doesn’t really matter that much. The gameplay benefit and variety that comes from the HEV zombies is worth more than potentially worrying about a small break in canon.</p>
<p>I highly doubt that Valve ever intended that the HEV suit provides the user immunity from Headcrabs, and we’re not in the habit of making illogical assumptions based on unstated facts. The original HL had only scientist zombies. Did this mean that Guards and Soldiers were immune to Headcrabs, just like the HEVs were? That’s the same logic, is it not? There also weren’t female scientists in the original - we have those too. Is that too far for you as well? Did Valve intend for the researchers at BMS to be 100% male?</p>
<p>You probably accept those latter 2 things, because they just make sense. HEV Zombies also just make logical sense, you just don’t like that because it contradicts your notion of canonicity. And it’s fine for you to not like it, but that doesn’t mean we have to adapt the game to fit that. Nor does it mean it’s a bad idea/doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>“What this basically means, is that you and I have very different visions about what Black Mesa should be, and your idea isn’t the one that we are making. And that’s okay - but you’re arguing a point which comes from that place that we simply can’t agree with.” I really disagree with this and it probably says that you didn’t even get where my vision about Black Mesa is. My vision lies exactly there, where it is now in the released state, so your “very different vision” statement is invalid. I appreciate the game development how it is and I was always stunned how correct it is to my liking, I would do it the same, if I could!<br>
“Sticking closely to the original is already WAY out of the window at this point. Sticking closely to the original was basically never the point of this project; it’s our own spin on the original. There’s no point simply remaking the original.” I disagree again, because it actually is sticking to original, it was point of the project and remaking the original has a point as it is a todays trend to remake original games. What is not that sticking to original is maybe Project Lambda and even this can’t be considered as “FAR AWAY” from it. Many things which in default setting doesn’t correspond to original have it’s ticks in Options menu which could make the gameplay more similar to HL1. Those are for instance: Always Run, Iron sights, View roll, etc. Even the newer shotgun model was changed so it corresponds more to HL1 model!!! (although I like here more the first SPAS model, but I have it replaced back via Workshop, problem solved!) How could you say it’s WAY out from original I don’t know. Xen might be different, but it is great it’s different in this part, because it matches todays players graphical demands, and it is the exact part where you can express your lvl dsgn art and creativity, sticking here with the original cave-like design may just wouldn’t be enough.<br>
And to rest of your post… doubts or no doubts…look…<br>
There will be always 100 reasons from you that will defend your HEV zombie idea, and there will be 100 reasons from me or the others offending the idea.  And exactly because of this, I find it QUESTIONABLE. And because it’s questionable, please, make it optional as the other features. You already have a Black Mesa bookmark in the options. Scripting it optional and put Grunt or other NPC’s instead shouldn’t be that hard I believe. You will make me, and I believe lot of other people happy. You guys made a lot of work and cared about many details, and this is a last detail that should be dealed to create an outstanding remake.</p>

<p>In my opinion it doesn’t matter if HEV scientists died because of headcrab attack. There are stronger enemies and other hazards that probably killed HEV teams, like Vorts, bullsquids, houndeyes, various plants and other enviroment hazards.

<p>There is no proof Headcrabs have an ability to “revive” and control the corpse. It’s not an “Aliens” mechanics. They attack and tend to control only a live body.</p>

<p>It really is not. Headcrabs have beaks. If they can drill through your SKULL they can also easily drill through a helmet. Might take them a bit longer though. Arguing about this is nothing short of nonsensical in my opinion.<br>
((((HL1 headcrabs have a front row of teeth, HL2 headcrabs have no teeth at all, they have two sharp thingies next to their front row of legs, and when Kleiner talks about debeaking  Lamarr he probably means those because in her model, they are missing. Those are too small and in no logical world would they offer the advantage of chewing trough flesh, let alone metal at best you should  think of them as you do the fangs of a spider))))</p>

<p>lmao what? That is a literal strawman argument right there. No, adding Link would not make sense, because it does not fit into the world of Half-Life. Adding HEV Zombies does fit into the world of Half-Life. It really is that simple.<br>
((((No it’s not, I went with an extreme example, but the point stands, if your world has rules, you should follow them, anything that goes against the rules of your world by definition doesn’t make sense in your world and won’t fit.

<p>Kind of besides the point. He is clearly talking about Half-Life 1, not Decay.There were no female scientists in Half-Life 1. No, the hologram doesn’t count, because the hologram being Gina Cross is a retcon that didn’t exist back in 1998.</p>
<p>((((The hologram counts because A: She has to work in the facility to record that training and B: It was part of the original which is an official game made by Valve and to date I haven’t seen a HL game that that retcons her training recording mostly because it would make no sense to retcon something like that anyway. The fact that you don’t even know HL1 had a female scientist kind of puts your validity into question, the fact that a DEVELOPER of Black Mesa doesn’t know that is even more scary.))))</p>

<p>I’d go a step further and say you didn’t go far enough, instead of creating something new you just created a variation of an existing enemy, instead of making a new alien you made a variation of the houndeye, you could have put a charger in there and had your own spin on it, but you just remodeled a houndeye and tweaked the effects. Black Mesa always struck me as a game that never knew what it wanted to be, it never wants to be the original but it also never has the balls to break away from the original and actually do something new, it just stays in the middle.</p>

<p>I don’t get it. Black Mesa Xen is almost <em>nothing</em> like Half-Life Xen, they tried something new literally at every corner, and here you are complaining about them not having revived a cut creature from Half-Life 1? Besides, wouldn’t reviving the charger would have been just copying old ideas?! I don’t understand this line of reasoning at all. Also, Textfamguy literally already answered your last question there. Black Mesa tries to stick as closely to Half-Life <em>where it makes sense</em>. It’s  basically a reimagination of Half-Life if Valve made it in the current day. Keep what works, maybe add some new elements here and there, throw out what doesn’t work.<br>
TLDR: It’s beyond me why people are stuck up on these minute details that make barely any difference at all, instead of just accepting that CC have taken some artistic liberties with what is their OWN version of Half-Life Xen. It’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>(((( I’m not complaining, I’m giving my opinion, not everything that goes against the herd is a complaint. I gave the cut creature as an example, doesn’t mean they have to implement exactly that. It’s very obvious that the HL community can’t create new things, they either just go with what HL1 and 2 had or they use cut beta content because anything knew to them wouldn’t fit in with the series. It still would have been better than just a houndeye reskin with slight tweaks though, after all that is what he stated their goal was, to create something new (that wasn’t in the first game), yet they just recycle.</p>
<p>Using the excuse that they stick close “where it makes sense” literally makes no sense because a lot of the changes made in BM wouldn’t need to be there by that logic. The marines never had to sound so annoying, the bullsquid never needed that binocular vision redesign with that “oh look how scary I am by showing my sharp teeth constantly” design, On a rail never had to be cut, Xen never had to have 70 different color palettes and earthly looking flora there. Yes it makes sense to improve upon gameplay but the visuals were purely subjective, they never had to change those because there was nothing that “made sense” to be fixed. No, I’m not complaining about the looks of Xen but using the “when it makes sense” for such subjective changes is illogical. Which part of changing the position of the bullsquids eyes made sense? It’s like saying “I made the vorts green cuz it makes sense”. Fixing bugs makes sense, I tell ya that.</p>
<p>Also the devs like to tout BM like a reimagining, but really apart from Xen what is actually reimagined? It remade the levels, it made the enemies HD and tweaked them a bit, the voice acting is new, the guns are tweaked, it’s a remake. There are no new subplots, new characters, aliens, guns, the areas are pretty much the same but with slight alterations and prettier graphics. Doom 3 is a reimagining, it takes Doom 1’s story but other than that it’s completely different. Serious Sam HD tweaked enemy health, damage, made the levels HD, tweaked the AI a bit, is that a reimagining? No it’s a remake, so is Black Mesa. If Black Mesa was a true reimagining people wouldn’t constantly confuse it for a remake because it would be obvious that it’s different. As I said, the devs like to pride themselves on changing things but apart from visuals, slight level layout changes, and the reinventing of Xen’s maps, what is there that is different? Are they going to introduce new to Half Life creatures? New weapons and mechanics? New characters?</p>
<p>No need to argue more here, especially to someone who doesn’t even know basic things about HL1. Also yes, I didn’t separate the replies, I can’t be bothered : P))))</p>

            <p>As someone who committed fandom apostacy long ago by assuming that Gordon does <span class="bbcode-i">indeed</span> have a helmet, I never really saw any problem with the HEV zombies. The suit is able to ward off headcrabs until it fails structurally at zero health, at which point the crab is able to either dislodge the helmet or break it apart (seeing as they can indeed rip off the tops of skulls with no problem).</p>

<p>" The original HL had only scientist zombies. Did this mean that Guards and Soldiers were immune to Headcrabs, just like the HEVs were? "<br>
No it means they were limited to using 1 model, however it doesn’t take much thought to come to the conclusion that it’s silly for a headcrab to eat through metal. Even the soldiers can be explained due to some not wearing helmets, same for some security guards. Valve probably also didn’t think about these things when they made the zombine, but we can only speculate whether it was a bad logic defying oversight or whether the combine modifications on the headcrab allowed it to eat trough metal.</p>
<p>If we go by the logic of “just because it wasn’t there, doesn’t mean it’s impossible for it to exist” for every silly idea we might as well add in Link from Legend of Zelda as a side companion who got stuck in Xen or something, cause as long as it looks cool, who cares about logic.

<p>“There also weren’t female scientists in the original”<br>
Incorrect, Gina Cross was a scientist who recorded herself wearing the hazard suit and giving instructions during the hazard course in HL1</p>
<p>Anyway it doesn’t matter, can probably mod the model so if someone doesn’t like it they can change it. Of all the changes BM has done to enemy designs, levels, atmosphere and so on, it’s silly to get stuck up about 1 npc, Xen in BM seems to have Earthly looking plants ffs. But it doesn’t matter, the original will always be there and having two different experiences won’t hurt anybody, it’s  rude to tell people how they should make their own passion projects, I’d definitely be annoyed if I shared my own vision only to get people upset and nagging at me that it’s not how they wanted it to be.</p>
<p>“The gameplay benefit and variety that comes from the HEV zombies is worth more than potentially worrying about a small break in canon.”<br>

            <p>What this basically means, is that you and I have very different visions about what Black Mesa should be, and your idea isn’t the one that we are making. And that’s okay - but you’re arguing a point which comes from that place that we simply can’t agree with.</p>
<p>I mean, you saw the Xen Trailer, right? Sticking closely to the original is already WAY out of the window at this point. Sticking closely to the original was basically never the point of this project; it’s our own spin on the original. There’s no point simply remaking the original. The original can’t be topped at what it does, and it still exists. It’s a masterpiece of gaming history, warts and all. That’s the original, authentic HL experience. This is our take on it. We stick close to the original where it makes sense and benefits the game. which is a lot of the time. This particular point? Doesn’t really matter that much. The gameplay benefit and variety that comes from the HEV zombies is worth more than potentially worrying about a small break in canon.</p>
<p>I highly doubt that Valve ever intended that the HEV suit provides the user immunity from Headcrabs, and we’re not in the habit of making illogical assumptions based on unstated facts. The original HL had only scientist zombies. Did this mean that Guards and Soldiers were immune to Headcrabs, just like the HEVs were? That’s the same logic, is it not? There also weren’t female scientists in the original - we have those too. Is that too far for you as well? Did Valve intend for the researchers at BMS to be 100% male?</p>
<p>You probably accept those latter 2 things, because they just make sense. HEV Zombies also just make logical sense, you just don’t like that because it contradicts your notion of canonicity. And it’s fine for you to not like it, but that doesn’t mean we have to adapt the game to fit that. Nor does it mean it’s a bad idea/doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>Freeman is resistant because he is the player. It’s not a fun gameplay experience to have the player immediately die to a Headcrab in the name of realism or consistency. Whether he wears a helmet or not is borderline irrelevant at that point.  It only raises key questions if you start focusing on lore details that are secondary to gameplay. The suit is that powerful because it’s the player’s suit. Not because the suit is actually that powerful. There’s a pretty key distinction there. We also care about story, coherence and rules.

<p>Zombie HEVs are a cool gameplay piece which don’t stretch the logic of the game world. They are stretching the logic in your mind because you are conflating the godliness of the player with godliness of the suit/scientists, which isn’t really intended from an in-universe perspective.</p>
<p>Also - I don’t appreciate the way you’ve worded much of what you’ve said. It’s unnecessarily inflammatory and aggressive. Knock it off, relax your tone, and post constructively.</p>

<p>Ok, I apologize if my reactions seems agressive, I don’t intend to force my opinion to anyone. But it’s my bad, I didn’t mention the true point of all this: Black Mesa is a REMASTER of Half-life, or a re-vision as was stated. Since this character wasn’t in original game, it shouldn’t be force added into a remaster. Remaster shouldn’t add new questionable characters that testifies about key assets of the game -&gt; HEV suit. If this character already existed in some of the Valve game, I won’t say a single word. What if it is not meant to be like this from the original? What if HEV truly means resistance to headcrabs by it’s developer, only he or Valve should answer this…<br>
I always appreciated about Black Mesa that it sticks to the original -&gt; weapons, levels, storyline, characters, etc. It brings only a remaster/revisit graphical needed changes, or just some small level changes like the puzzle which doesn’t create any questions. Remaster should just rejuvenate original Half-life and you guys from Crowbar Collective know this. New character shouldn’t be added, + if it brings answer to a non answered question by original developer. Please, don’t force add it to the game. Make it an optional feature or keep it as an add-on.<br>
All the best!</p>

<p>That was actually one of the original devs saying that. I think he was responsible for the character design of Gordon too!</p>

            <p>The only reason why a (Freeman) does not succumb to the (Headcrabs) is because it is not in the script, it would not make sense that the protagonist of the story dies on that point of the history, adding the (HEV Zombie) to the game is a success but also it would be that the (antlions) and (headcrab with variants) were added because the Vortiganos admit that they are native creatures of that (XEN) which they exploited, besides (Big Momma) is a species different from the (headcrabs), the (headcrabs) reproduce with other sources in nests such as spiders according to lore (Half-Life), sure you can put (antlions) outside the map only can be visibles not interact with they as you do with the (manta rays) in “Forget about Freeman”.</p>
<p>What if they should add extra are 2 or 3 shades of color of scale to the (vortigaunt’s) and remove those shiny eyes or reduce it a little.</p>

            <p>I always assumed that the suit was protective, but only so long as the user’s health remained above 0. That is, if a headcrab delivered what would otherwise be a lethal blow, then the headcrab could take control. The other explanations are also good enough to satisfy any questions here, I think.</p>

            <p>Freeman is resistant because he is the player. It’s not a fun gameplay experience to have the player immediately die to a Headcrab in the name of realism or consistency. Whether he wears a helmet or not is borderline irrelevant at that point.  It only raises key questions if you start focusing on lore details that are secondary to gameplay. The suit is that powerful because it’s the player’s suit. Not because the suit is actually that powerful. There’s a pretty key distinction there. We also care about story, coherence and rules. But it’s secondary to gameplay. There is zero in-universe reason for Freeman to be the only one who can survive through all this nonsense, aside from the fact that he’s the player.</p>
<p>Zombie HEVs are a cool gameplay piece which don’t stretch the logic of the game world. They are stretching the logic in your mind because you are conflating the godliness of the player with godliness of the suit/scientists, which isn’t really intended from an in-universe perspective.</p>
<p>Also - I don’t appreciate the way you’ve worded much of what you’ve said. It’s unnecessarily inflammatory and aggressive. Knock it off, relax your tone, and post constructively.</p>

            <p>“treating everyone else like they’re fools for not buying your attempts to justify your own level of purism isn’t the most friendly way to carry yourself.”<br>
WTF, i am not treating anyone as fools I am just rejecting “realism” argument here, cuz it has nothing to do with it and a “weird means nothing” reply which actually says nothing.<br>
It may not break it, but it creates many questions about key assets that are not clear.<br>
As seen Freeman jumping to port on Xen he has no helmet, and is still resistant. 1+1=2. Get it.</p>

            <p>This doesn’t break story, coherence, context or rules. Why are you so adamant that it’s an unlikely scenario? There’s clearly camps where BM Personnel are hanging around, perhaps on occasion they remove their helmets when in these areas? Perhaps not all personnel are helmet equipped? We see in Half-Life a scientist or two in Xen who have <span class="bbcode-i">no</span> HEV suit to speak of, I don’t find it hard to believe that a HEV-suited scientist would remove their helmet in areas they believed safer, only to have a camp ransacked at an inopportune time. You could point out the camps that aren’t at all part of Half-Life 1’s definitively canon story, context or rules, or the houndeye-like explosive creatures which not only violate all of that but also probably don’t even make any biological sense in the slightest, or the swamp that doesn’t exist, or blah blah blah. You’re not concerned w/ any of that, you’re concerned w/ justifying the one area that irks your purism. I understand everyone’s concern with purism lands on different levels,  but you’re not using any sound logic to back it up, and treating everyone else like they’re fools for not buying your attempts to justify your own isn’t the most friendly way to carry yourself.</p>
