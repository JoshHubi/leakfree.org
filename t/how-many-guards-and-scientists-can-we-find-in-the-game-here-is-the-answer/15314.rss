    <title>How many guards and scientists can we find in the game? - Here is the answer.</title>

    <description>Greetings everyone!


While waiting patiently for the next great update, I decided to make an attempt at determining the number of Black Mesa employees we can find throughout the game. Years ago I did it with Half-Life. There, excluding the Hazard Course and the Xen chapters, we can find:


[b]   34 security guards alive, 22 dead.[/b]

[b]   104 scientists alive and 57 dead.[/b]


[b]   35 zombies[/b] and [b]3 awesome forklifter guys, called &quot;Gus&quot;.[/b]


This puts the total number at [b]255[/b].



With Black Mesa, this quest took me... slightly longer. First thing first, I made a couple of rules for the job, like:

- Anomalous Materials and Unforseen Consequences chapters are considered completly separate.

- Scripted events are ignored. If an npc is alive at the moment we find him, than he is marked as alive.

- Zombies.... alive, dead, half dead or very dead... they are all the same to me.

- Burnt bodies are counted: usually it&#39;s easy to determine wether they were friends or foes.

- If only a part of the body remains, I look for a vital part like torso, spine or skull. A lonely severed leg doesn&#39;t have to mean it&#39;s owner is dead (rip Eli Vance)

- Sometimes only some suspecious blood mark remains on the floor or on the walls. Those are counted as well.


One question remains. What version of the game I used?

* The up to date Steam version of Black Mesa, extended with the [b]OAR: Uncut[/b] and [b]WGH - Vent Mods[/b].


So , here is the brakedown of all the chapters. Or you can just skip it it to avoid nightmares with all these numbers.

Summa summarum, in Black Mesa, I&#39;ve found

* [b]51 security guards alive, 81 dead and 33 zombified.[/b]
* [b]146 scientists alive, 136 dead and 106 zombified.[/b]
* [b]34 suspecious blood or body remains.[/b]
* [b]6 suspecious burned husks.[/b]
* [b]22 dead engineers (in OAR UNCUT)[/b]
* [b]and 8 dead office clerks (in OAR UNCUT)[/b]
This puts the total number at [b]623[/b].  - 39% of the total 1600 employees the BMRF claims to has in an advertisement.

Phew. This is it for now...

... or did I miss anything? Well, if we want to go even crazier... there is a total [b]147 barnacles[/b] spread around the facility. When killed, every single of them spits out some human remains, including a skull usually.  Guess our collegues really lost their heads in the chaos.</description>
