    <description>Loving the game but it is taking me far too long to jump onto objects. I feel like I am constantly trying to glitch my way through the game. Any jumping advice?</description>

<li>Yes, it sucks.</li>
<li>Use crouch jump, ALWAYS. (Space+Ctrl) Regular jump is useless.</li>
<li>They are stubborn about it and likely wont change it.</li>
<li>Suck it up and get used to it. That’s what I did, even though it took me half the game to do so.</li>
<li>[See the post above mine.]</li>

            <p>This issue is killing me too. Like  many I have waited patiently for 8 years for this and I think what the team did is beyond amazing!..Thank you for seeing it through! My only complaint is you just cant jump high enough to get through the levels without frustration. Why can’t I jump high enough to get on top of a barrel when it’s on it’s side? That would solve so much. If Gordon could just jump another couple inches higher it’d be awesome. I am stuck on the level where the walkway gets destroyed by a houndeye and you have to jump on the pipes and follow them over to the opening in the wall. It takes many try’s at running jumps to jump on the barrel (lying sideways) to even be able to jump on the lower pipe…then once I get there I can’t jump up to the next higher pipe. It’s really frustrating…In original HL this section was easy to manuever. And the level previous where you had to stack things to get into the upper wall opening to access the control room for the slanted elevator was really something…took me 45 mins and alot of luck to finally get up there. If you could just tweak the jumping height this mod would be perfect.</p>
