    <title>GPU Upgrdade? Or CPU Upgrade?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gpu-upgrdade-or-cpu-upgrade/5978</link>
    <description>K so the other day, I felt that my computer is pretty beast for now, so I figured i&#39;d mess with the laptop I had laying around (ASUS G71x Laptop... or was it G70..)
Well anyways, I wanted to get your guys&#39; opinion on what i should upgrade.

I have an intel core duo p8700 at 2.53 ghz

As for the gpu, i have an Nvidia GEForce GTX 260m

What do you guys think i&#39;d be better off upgrading, as to make my gaming experience more enjoyable?

Edit: Suggestions as to what i should buy would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>ASUS laptops use a proprietary reverse-MXM format for GFX cards, which means that any upgrades that you do find (the only worthy one would be the 5870m) would cost you an arm and a leg.</p>

            <p>I strongly recommend against overclocking. The reason being that most laptop coolers are barley adequate for stock frequencies due to the inherent lemited space for proper cooling. The increased heat places strain on the whole system seriously reducing the life of the equipment.</p>
<p>While you have the thing apart don’t forget to clean it out and spend the money on proper thermal compound. A faster processor will run a little hotter (unless it happens t o be a smaller atrecture than your current chip then it may be similar). Just doing those simple things can drop a system 10º.</p>

            <p>Your board should support at least all the mobile core 2 duos, get the fastest one that uses the same socket type.</p>

            <p>All sounds great guys. So it looks like im upgrading my cpu.</p>
<p>You guys have any suggestions as to cpu’s that can run like 2.9 or 3 ghz? More than that would be even better</p>
<p>Edit: The more cores, the better</p>

            <p>Just noticed this is a laptop…</p>
<p>Your only choice is to upgrade the CPU, if you can find the PLL chipset you can use SETFsb to overclock that core 2 duo to about 2.8 or so depends on your ram clock limit, also you can overclock the GPU with RivaTuner, don’t overclock it though, I bet it will have heat issues.</p>

            <p>2.53Ghz Dual Core? You CPU is fine. A better choice would be to get either a new GPU, or maybe better RAM if it’s less than DDR3 with 2gb’s.</p>
<p>But yeah, I would think that GPU is best choice for an upgrade.</p>

<p>yea every part of the laptop is interchangeable.</p>
<p>do you have any suggestions as to what cpu I should look into?</p>
<p>and as for the video card, money isn’t too much of an issue, so suggestions as to what I should look for would be great!</p>
