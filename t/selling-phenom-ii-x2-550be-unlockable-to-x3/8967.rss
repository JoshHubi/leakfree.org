Phenom II x2 550 Black Edition. Dual core processor, standard clock 3.1 Ghz, and it comes in completely original packaging, along with documentation and a &#39;high end&#39; AMD brand cooler.


[i]Now I&#39;m not going to try and fool people into thinking I haven&#39;t overclocked with this chip. I have. In fact it&#39;s one of the selling points of this specific chip[/i]


- Amd produced their processors as quad cores(x4), and locked any number of those during production. Essentially, these cores lay &#39;dormant&#39; in processors that are sold as dual core(x2). It was discovered that the dormant cores are functional, and can be &#39;unlocked&#39; on some of the earlier chips. 

- Core unlocking was clamped down by AMD. As a result, newer 550&#39;s, and the 555 replacement, cannot do this.

- This chip specifically, will run as a fully functioning tri-core (x3). 

- Overclocking wise, the 550 stands out from it&#39;s competitors, as you&#39;d expect from a &#39;black edition&#39; processor. An unlocked multiplier gives excellent flexibility when setting options in the bios. Highest speed I&#39;ve run it is an impressive 3.7Ghz, stable, with three cores.

- In benchmarks, this chip when unlocked and overclocked rivals several of AMD&#39;s quad core processors. I chose to keep this instead of upgrading to a Phenom II x4 945. 

- The chip has never run hot; I&#39;ve used an aftermarket cooler on it, and I&#39;ve never seen more than 40*c while under maximum load, three cores.

- The 550 comes with a smaller AMD cooler as standard. But instead, I&#39;ve included one of the larger AMD coolers, designed for higher end chips, and can cool more effectively.


Of course, none of the above is meant to discredit the factory settings. Even when run as purchased, the 550 has great speed flexibility, as well as surprisingly low power consumption. I ran mine like this satisfied for a long time before looking into getting more &#39;juice&#39; out of it. And when I did that, it certainly didn&#39;t dissapoint either.  The 550BE is a perfect processor for someone building a gaming PC on a budget, but is just as happy sat in a media centre or a workstation.

            <p>Indeed. Paired with my 5850 and 8 gig ram, it was still eating up all but a few of the very most demanding games.</p>
<p>My reasoning for upgrading wasn’t because it lacked gaming power, rather I needed a cpu with more cores for my work.</p>

            <p>That is a fairly decent piece of tech you have there! I myself don’t really need to buy it since I have a 3.4 Ghz Quadie Phenom which I love and would have children with if the fan was a little bit less choppy  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
But yeah, the price is quite nice and the speed is good enough to play basically anything out there. Someone may come along and but  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
