Happy Wheels is a flash motocross game, but not like any other motocross games. It has litres of blood coming out of you when you lose your limbs, quite hard levels, and 4 characters with unique abilities. It also has a built in level editor, so you can kill your character YOUR way.

The characters are : The Wheelchair Hobo, The Segway Dude, The Bicycle Dude with a kid, and The Fat Lady on a scooter. My favorite is the Hobo, because the rocket wheelchair is fucking awesome.

Have fun, and dont forget to post screenshots of your dismembered character.</description>

            <p>It was the performing of balancing in the wheelchair, even if it was not too safe. This will really help disabled people to balance themselves by using this equipment. The price may be reasonable for sure.</p>

            <p>Segway is nice for autobalancing, but it’s too narrow for platformer areas.</p>
<p>Bicycle goes well. You just have to knock the kid off to become a stripped down speed-machine.</p>
<p>Scooter seems the easiest.</p>
