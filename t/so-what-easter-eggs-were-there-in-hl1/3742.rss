    <title>So what easter eggs were there in HL1?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-what-easter-eggs-were-there-in-hl1/3742</link>
    <description>I went by the FAQ in the wiki to see if it differed from the forum FAQ. The thing about easter eggs made me wonder... what easter eggs where there in half-life 1? I can&#39;t recall any.</description>

there is a pic of her in his locker?!?!?!?!?!?</p>

<p>It’s not his daughter, there was a letter in one of the old instruction manuals that mentioned he had no “dependents” it was most likely a relative of one of the the developers put in there as an easter egg. In universe it was probably a more distant relative (a cousin perhaps).</p>

            <p>In the chapter Surface Tension,there is a easter egg(and more of course). When you are at the cliffside,you will find a hgrunt having a huge rock on his back that killed him but his body is still there and not gibbed yet. (I guess that many already know this one though :|)</p>
