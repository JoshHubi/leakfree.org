    <title>Crosbow-Zoom-Sensitivity and Collision Issues on Rocks.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crosbow-zoom-sensitivity-and-collision-issues-on-rocks/13915</link>
    <description>For me the crossbow-zoom-sensitivity-factor always restets to 1.0 in the settings. It is a bit annoying.
Also, ingame a lowered sensitivity remains until after the unscope-animation ends. IMHO it should reset to normal, as soon as you disable zoom (when you get hit from behind, you need to turn quickly, but only turn wiht 0.1 or whatever you have set).

And some rocks have a different collision mesh than their actual displayed mesh. THis affected gameplay in the following ways.


In Surface Tension I had one occasion where my valuable crowssbow arrow was wasted because it got stuck in midair although I had clearly aimed past the rock  (the rock is on the ledge before you enter the dam where you first encounter the helicopter)

The second major collision issue I had was even worse. When I battled the helicopter in the mountains and hid behind the rocks on the left  I aimed the guiding laser at the heliucopter but the rockets didn&#39;t react because I actually aimed at the invisible collision mesh, although Iit looked like I had the laser right on the chopper. I wasted some rockets and lost some precious health. 

Apart from that. Great game so far.  :slight_smile:</description>
