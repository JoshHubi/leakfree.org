<p>Yeah haha, it’s not like huge gaming studios like Epic and id created PC games that were completely MP based over 10 years ago and they were hugely successful.</p>

</aside>
<p>Feedback from play testing is different from feedback after releasing a game. Dev’s only make changes based on a small sample of play testers and this does not represent the overall population. Also feedback from play testing is just basic general stuff like: “dont make jumping too slow” where as after the game is released, thats where the real feedback comes from. Like just what you wrote right now, about the kill streak bullshit, that information was collected after people played the game for 2 weeks on the multiplayer.</p>
<p>Also i doubt the play tester would have the balls to tell nor would the game dev be willing to listen to a big gameplay altering suggestion.</p>

<p>Sure the market dictates but when every fucking game has to have some level of multiplayer its a bit annoying. I mean for gods sake Overlord had multiplayer. And the amount of hyped up bad multiplayer games for consoles is so tremendous. Hell I asked a friend who plays Xbox if he had played Braid and he laughed calling it a faggot game, because it was a singleplayer sidescrolling game. While its the market its also not the best thing that every game does it, becuase then when a game doesn’t have multiplayer the market won’t prefer to buy it over the hyped up piece of shit game with multiplayer.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This. I have some retarded “friends” that when I tell them about a singleplayer or multiplayer shooter, will immediatly talk about MW2, even though it’s repetetive, has ridiculous gameplay and has to much emphasis on Assault rifles. I’m sorry but I want to play a game where I can win with a shotgun or heavy machinegun, not just some kind of easy mode spray and pray weapon. It was this bad in other games, and I thought IW would finally change this and what happens: They give the community the scavenger perk, giving them a complete resupply on ammo after they got their unjustified spraying kill, and when you think they’re at the very least almost out of supply: You see him fucking spray his gun getting a few hits in the fucking <span class="bbcode-i">legs</span> and kills the other guy and gets a complete resupply upon walking to a corpse. The game lost the meaning of skill ever since CoD 4 came out, and I’m never gonna play any CoD game again.</p>

            <p>I hate it because it cost $60 US. for the most basic version of it. With the PC gaming  market as shunned as it is, I always saw the $10 cheaper price of PC games as a sort of apology. Then Infinity Ward charged PC gamers $60 for MW2, and suddenly it was like the cat was out of the bag, now I am seeing multiple PC games selling for $60 for the base version, and on Steam no less. Its a bloody ripoff and thats the problem.</p>

            <p>Horrible short (and stupid) single player campaign. The multiplayer is decent but not as good as MW1. No dedicated servers. No moddability whatsoever. $60 for PC version. It’s published by Activision.</p>

            <p>Sure the market dictates but when every fucking game has to have some level of multiplayer its a bit annoying. I mean for gods sake Overlord had multiplayer. And the amount of hyped up bad multiplayer games for consoles is so tremendous. Hell I asked a friend who plays Xbox if he had played Braid and he laughed calling it a faggot game, because it was a singleplayer sidescrolling game. While its the market its also not the best thing that every game does it, becuase then when a game doesn’t have multiplayer the market won’t prefer to buy it over the hyped up piece of shit game with multiplayer.</p>

<p>Hahahaha. this is why I hate console gaming. all its about now is multiplayer. The developers spend more time on multiplayer then singleplayer and ultimately make the singleplayer bad. I have nothing wrong with a game being released with only multiplayer. I mean if CODMW2 was released only multiplayer no one would complain. And at that point it would be ALL multiplayer, but because they put an unpolished bad SP campaign in it will be complained about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of my complaints about the game is that during its early development stages, Infinity Ward keeps saying things like Task Force 141 is the “International Coalition of Badasses” and “Best Handpicked Warriors on the planet” which made me expect more from the campaign, but in the finished product many of them keep getting killed off in the most anti-climatic way.</p>
<p>And yes single-player is very, very short like 5 to 6 hours estimated time of completion even in higher difficulties.</p>
<p>The whole TF141 thing might just be me being a perfectionist, but still…</p>

            <p>I’ve played a little bit of the single player for COD MW 2 and that was pretty damn cool.<br>
After having played the first COD and EVERY COD since the first one I’ve grown bored of the multi-player. COD MW was fun at first then the chaos just got frustrating then really boring. But I’m a huge fan of Co-op game play and that’s where my heart resides. Chaos multi-player team death match or anything else has been around since I started playing HL 1. It’s a stale game-play with a graphical face lift.</p>
<p>Just my opinion though of course.</p>
<p>And plus the hype of the game is out of control. I go to a tech school and everyone uncluding the instructors can’t stop talking about it and I am sick of hearing about it. I’m at school to learn about motorcycles not talk about an over-rated/over-hyped game.</p>
