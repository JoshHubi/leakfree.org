    <title>Foolish youtube/moddb comments.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/foolish-youtube-moddb-comments/797</link>
    <description>Twas a good thread back in the day, so I&#39;ve decided to reconstruct it. Post retarded things that youtubers, moddb people and others say about black mesa.

I have one to start. if someone wants to translate, be my guest. I have no idea what the hell he&#39;s saying. this was pulled from moddb:

[COLOR=&#39;Sienna&#39;]&quot;Oh, my God, you do not want to believe do not believe me and not some fucked up then writes comments like &quot;Your a noob if you think everybody is stupid enough to believe you.&quot;. You do not think that anyone I believe. How can you call yourself as HLFan `s can not even believe that this mod is not dead. Why whom 5 and a half years work in the ass. As I wrote above, you do not have to believe me. 

You will see the truth if I said a month or two, and not the end of 2009. But I think that this mod come out sooner. 

And then we&#39;ll see whether or not I spoke the truth! 

* PS: Close the muzzle and keep the comments about whether the faith that this mod is not dead or not! I`m says politely to you and you insult me motherfuckers.&quot;
Your turn.</description>

            <p>not an exact qoute, just from memory.</p>
<p>“Blackmesa is not a mod, it is a seperate game, you will have to pay for it, and you do not need a source game to play it.”<br>
Probably a troll, but still finny.</p>
