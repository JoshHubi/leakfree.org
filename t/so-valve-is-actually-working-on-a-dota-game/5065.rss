<p>Also, it’s better to be split between a few projects. Then if one of them flops you have other games to fall back on.</p>

<p>I’m not upset about the pushback of Portal 2, because they had the decency to actually tell us.  And yes, Valve has multiple teams, but they have only so much money to go around, I can’t imagine it’s not already spread thin between Portal 2, porting to Mac, porting to PS3, updating game engines, supporting released products, constant additions to TF2, that new Alien Whatever game they just released (which isn’t even generating revenue back for the cost of making it), and now DOTA.</p>
<p>Also, how the hell does Valve have any legal rights or access to the content of DOTA?  Isn’t that just a special way of playing Warcraft 3?  Aren’t they basically filing a copyright for content another living, active company made?  Oh god how this happen i no good with law.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Are you kidding me VALVe is one of the most prosperous game companies around and the Alien Swarm generates revenue through getting more steam users.</p>
<p>Bottom line, Valve isn’t spreading thin.  Its just not sitting on all its resources its using them to their full potential.</p>

            <p>Steam alone gives Valve enough money to just slack off for a decade without making any new games.</p>
<p>Besides, all we know is that they registered the DotA name for trademark. For all we know they may have 70% of the team working around the clock on EP3 right now.</p>

            <p>Putting a game, Episode 3 for example, on hold so as not to spread resources too thin, is managing resources.  And I STILL haven’t been given any hints that this isn’t what they’re doing to help afford to work on so many other crazy projects.  I’m not asking for a gigantic press release.  Hell, I’m not even asking for a complete sentence.  I’d be satisfied with a random message from Valve saying “working on Episode 3”.</p>
