<p>Ok, thanks for all the help so far. I’ve gone for the ATI 4870 1GB card. I think I’ll leave the soundcard and see how I fare without it - if it’s really that terrible (and I don’t think I’ll be that fussed personally), I can always install one.</p>

<p>In a real world environment, matched clocks and all, a quad core is going to shit on a dual core. You have more threads to work with and can split a workload much better.</p>

            <p>Sweet, yeah, my teachers always said I talked too fast. I wonder if I was talking normally but just said things that make no sense…</p>
<p>-Anyways, Is 500W good for a normal gaming computer because I have room for $50 more?</p>

            <p>It sounds like you <span class="bbcode-i">want</span> a power supply that doesn’t support all your stuff, lol.</p>
<p>Pretty sure any modern power supply should be able to power all your stuff… If you have uncommon things, like… I dunno, 2/4 SLI / Crossfire’d huge video cards, water cooling, or whatever, then just check the specs of the power supply. Actually, water cooling probably doesn’t require anything from the power supply, but whatever.</p>

<p>If you have a 2.1 set up then you probably wouldn’t give a damn about it emulating the 5.1.</p>
<p>On initial set up onboard is serviceable. There is a noticeable difference, even with bargain 5.1 system, but it can be added later. The GTS 250 matches up about even in performance with the 4850. The 4850 is a might bit cheaper. If you were looking for the performance of the GTS 250, and don’t <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> the extra the 4870 needs you could go for a 4850 even.</p>

<p>Superb answers to my queries, thanks. That’s eased my mind a bit. Okay, so I’ve got rid of the sound card, gone for an E7400 Processor and a XFX GTS250 GPU, which brings it down to £381.34… Fuck yeah. Dudes, I’m indebted.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d go for an ATI 4870 instead of that GTS250. It’s slightly faster, it should cost around 10 pounds more, but it’s a slightly better bang for your buck.<br>
Unless you’re an nvidia fanboy, hehe.</p>

<p>Superb answers to my queries, thanks. That’s eased my mind a bit. Okay, so I’ve got rid of the sound card, gone for an E7400 Processor and a XFX GTS250 GPU, which brings it down to £381.34… Fuck yeah. Dudes, I’m indebted.</p>

<p>Sorry to hijack the thread a little, but it was probably better than starting a new one. I’d also like some advice on building a computer.</p>
<p>I’ve sorted out all the parts to a new computer that I’m planning to buy and build over the summer. It’s really my first attempt at building a computer and, although I have <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> idea of what I’m doing, I’m by no means certain.</p>
<p>So basically I’m asking whether these parts can work together and whether there are some massive steps that I’ve overlooked and whether I’m heading to a big disaster. I was also wondering whether I’ve spent money in the right places, whether I can afford to cut down in price in any areas, or whether you’d recommend any other parts? Here’s what I’ve got so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abit IP35 Pro XE (My sister’s boyfriend sold this to me for £40 so I’m not so fussed about this one)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 - £115</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corsair 4GB (2x2GB) DDR2 - £34</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Western Digital 500GB SATA II 7200RPM - £40</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XFX 9800GT 512MB DDR3 - £75</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCZ Stealth XStream 700W PSU - £70</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asus Xonar DX 7.1 PCI-Express Soundcard - £50</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antec 300 Three Hundred Black Case - £45</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That all comes to a total of about £470. The last two are ones that I’m not so sure about. Do I really need to splash out on a sound card? Also, will the Antec 300 be large enough and provide enough cooling? There are just lots of smaller details that I’m not sure on. Any help would be awesome.</p>

<p>The intel Core 2 Quad is a bit unnesacery. I’d say you’re better of with an Intel Core 2 Duo E7400. It’s quite a bit cheaper, and it doesn’t perform any less in games. There are barelly any games that make use of all 4 (Or 8 with multithreading] cores.</p>
<p>And then you got some extra money to spend on perhaps a different videocard. Maybe an ATI 4890?</p>
<p>Oh, and throw out the soundcard. Unless you buy a 200 pound one it doesn’t matter squat.<br>
Waste of money really. Better spend that on a better videocard or a better cpu. Or just save some money</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Also, since everyone is posting their pc question here, might be an idea to pin this and turn it into a general pc advice topic?</span></p>

            <p>Look I have a XFX 780i.</p>
<p>And the Nforce 7 range have a major heating problem on the northbridge.</p>
<p>All you have to do is stick a 90mm fan blowing onto it and its fine.</p>
<p>All thanks go to Ram for this, because he helped me solve my issues with it when I first got this mobo.</p>

<p>There’s your problem.<br>
Kidding, you should email alienware to send you proper drivers. (or a link to them)</p>

            <p>I do mind you hijacking the thread, and am now going to assasinate you anally.</p>
<p>But I don’t think an ATI-Nvidia relashionship would cause the crashes, I’m sure that the companies are aware that people will use both. If you can, send it to a repair center.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure how to find out what the specific problem is, that’s why I asked about the NVIDIA-ATI relationship, since I’ve heard that could cause problems.</p>
<p>I can tell you when games crash a little bubble pops-up saying “Display Driver atiumdag.dll  failed and has recovered successfully.” and that’s pretty frequently.</p>
<p>If you can give me a specific way to pinpoint what is actually going on, that would be great, but otherwise all I know is it has never worked like it’s suppose to and crashes a lot more than I would expect.</p>
