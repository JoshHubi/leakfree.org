    <title>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 video game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-amazing-spider-man-2-video-game/13119</link>
    <description>I was surprised there was no thread about this, so here we are.
The trailer -  [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUXS8c5QatQ[/url]
And the PS4 gameplay footage - [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_TdGkaXBAc[/url]
  Well, considering it being, more or less, the succesor to Spider-Man 2 movie game, which is STILL the BEST Spider-Man game , count me interested. While 90% of the things he said about added moves to swinging were already in SM2, it&#39;s still cool they&#39;re reincluding them, although they moved the camera back a little... Added Deus Ex Style do-it-your-own-way missions are interesting, especially compared to Arkham&#39;s &quot;Now you have to stealth, Now you have to fight&quot; restrictivness (give me freedom dammit), and the fact that you need to get close to do a stealth takedown is also awesome. But the graphics did seem a little meh, but oh well...
  These guys are getting better and better at this! I wonder that will be next!</description>

            <p>It’s time for some thread necromancy.<br>
As you know, the game released today. TheRadBrad already did a video on it and I must say what it looks rather amazing ( pun intended). The swinging already seems great,no more regenerating health during combat and awesome Stan Lee cameo.<br>
What do you think of it? Has anyone bought the game ?</p>

<p>So angry? What? I think you’ve massively overestimated the amount I care. I’m looking forward to Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I truly hope it IS better than SP2 but that’s just the end of it.</p>

            <p>No, Spider-man was voiced by Mike Vaughn in that game. Not the best voice, lol.</p>
<p>On TASM 2, the game looks amazing, and I love how they’re adding those alternative outfits, as well as the Hero Or Menace thing. Though I’m far more concerned about the actual movie, lol.</p>

<p>This.<br>
I remember Web Of Shadows - it was very demanding and looked extremely crappy for that kind of requirements… I had to scale it down to be able to play from my 1440x900 resolution to 1024x768 or 800x600 , which The only time I had to do was crysis 2…<br>
Although I haven’t played any Spiderman games on pc after what… Did they at least add any extensive options after, or , at least to the last TASM game?</p>

            <p>I must agree on the fact that it has a lot of inspirations from arkham games ( although Some can argue that arkham games also had a lot of inspirations from past spiderman games) like detective vision type spider-sense, stealth abilities , etc. But the fact that they are trying to push the envelope by giving you the freedom to do missions your own way, ability to Actually use stealth instead " take out everyone with stealth in this specially designed room and don’t worry about stealth afterwards" like arkham games do, the ability to play the alter-ego at will and the ability to FREAKING replay the mission you want instead of having to play from the beginning.</p>
<p>P.S. I do hope they add challenge rooms or something like that, even better if they add BOSS challenge rooms like in SM 2 , which , again, would be really cool to have in arkham games too…</p>

            <p>Looks like an awesome combination of Spider-Man 2 and the Arkham games which can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>One thing I did notice is that movement across different streets/buildings and up that pipe during the latter half of the video kind of makes it look like Spidey, for lack of a better word, snaps into certain movements. As in, on the pipe, it looks like he basically attaches to it, and you hold forward until you reach the end, which I’m sure if you’re intentionally getting on it, will be fine, but if you accidently land on it it’d probably lead to some frustrating situations.</p>
<p>Overall it looks awesome, just the movement itself doesn’t look quite as smooth as I personally think it should.</p>

            <p>Spiderman 2’s tongue-in-cheek vibe went perfectly with Sam Raimi’s own comedic sensibility. God damn, it was great. I just wish the PC got a proper port so I didn’t have to play it on a PS2 emulator that it barely works for. The Mysterio “boss” in the convenience store ought to go down in gaming history as best fucking thing ever done.</p>
<p>I love me a well done spiderman game, even if it is color by numbers. I’m getting this one.</p>
<p>aaaand wow. It actually looks really fun.</p>

<p>Good licensed games tend to get swept under the rug. The Riddick games are fucking masterpieces, and Xmen Origins: Wolverine is so good it made the movie look watchable. Wanted was alright, but way too short. It was helped by the fact that the devs were fans of the original comic and put some of the extended lore into the (totally inaccurate) movie adaptation universe. The Punisher game was fucking awesome. The LOTR trilogy games were great. One of the (non bethesda) terminator licensed titles was okay for their time. I believe it was Terminator 3: Redemption. It tends to go like this:</p>
<p>If the movie has a big extended universe/ is based on something that’s been around for a while, the game license will turn out okay. If the movie didn’t do too well, the game is even better.</p>

<p>Venom and main story missions were superbly done and were really nice, but combat was lacking, especially compared to SM 2, you didn’t have as much  awesome things to do in free roam ( just searching for hint tokens to hear that awesome Bruce Campbell voice, is one of the best things in sm2) , swinging didn’t feel as good as sm2, and the map was both smaller and less enjoyable to explore ( despite having some Easter eggs and tokens to collect ). Overall, it wasn’t as awesome as sm2, but was still the best one on pc till the amazin spiderman game.<br>
P.S. I do hope they add races back into sm games, they were one of the best things in past ones ( e.g. Sm2 and ultimate).</p>

            <p>Spider-Man movie and licensed games in general have an interesting tendency to be better than games just based on his character - For example, the amazing spiderman and spiderman 2 movie games, while based on movies, are one of the best ones, especially compared to edge of time and web of shadows. I wouldn’t write this one of the book so easily…</p>

            <p>I was surprised there was no thread about this, so here we are.<br>
The trailer -  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUXS8c5QatQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUXS8c5QatQ</a><br>
And the PS4 gameplay footage - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_TdGkaXBAc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_TdGkaXBAc</a><br>
Well, considering it being, more or less, the succesor to Spider-Man 2 movie game, which is STILL the BEST Spider-Man game , count me interested. While 90% of the things he said about added moves to swinging were already in SM2, it’s still cool they’re reincluding them, although they moved the camera back a little… Added Deus Ex Style do-it-your-own-way missions are interesting, especially compared to Arkham’s “Now you have to stealth, Now you have to fight” restrictivness (give me freedom dammit), and the fact that you need to get close to do a stealth takedown is also awesome. But the graphics did seem a little meh, but oh well…<br>
These guys are getting better and better at this! I wonder that will be next!</p>
