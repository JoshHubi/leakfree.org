<p>I was looking for a torrent to download the source SDK base 2007 and found one that includes Black Mesa too. I already found a fast torrent of black Mesa via GamersHell (yes! GamersHell offer torrent with webseed of their servers downloads!!!) so with the following torrent I selected blackmesa files and chose not to download. (live today 2013 aug 9th it is downloading slowly 50-120kb/s, but i prefer that cause steams bandwidth limit creates huge lags on my brothers cs:go online gameplay [even in very low limits])</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">https://kickass.to/black-mesa-source-sdk-base-2007-t6666492.html</code></pre>
<p>or the magnet link (copy paste in your address bar and hitting enter should open your torrent client and start downloading metadata)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">magnet:?xt=urn:btih:0E12553A6F2D43D15AD4B8AE31989EA21E037F72&amp;dn=black+mesa+source+sdk+base+2007&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80%2Fannounce&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337</code></pre>
<p>Posted here because others advanced users may be looking the same alternative to steam download service!</p>
<p>EDIT: Because I refered to GamersHell torrent I will give the main download page of the Black Mesa Free Full Game<code>
https://www.gamershell.com/download_93608.shtml
</code> under  red button “Download” click “Show advanced download options” select fast or/and closest server download, then in the next page, under the “Your download is ready. Please click here to download the file.”, there should be a “Download as torrent (using this mirror to seed)”!!!</p>

            <p>It sounds <span class="bbcode-i">kind of</span> like he thinks Valve will update the Base and break Black Mesa, but that like me trying to decode “has anyone really been far even as decided blah blah blah.” It’s pretty far fetched, but it’d the only translation I got.</p>

<p>Um, slightly confused but I’ll try to help.</p>
<p>Source SDK can be downloaded through Steam by going to the Library tab and finding the Tools Section.</p>
<p>After its downloaded the files themselves are located somewhere in your Steam folder. Its not necessary to back them up yourself.</p>
<p>BMS is installed in your sourcemods folder, which is located in your Steam folder (Normally around C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps). (Or Program Files (x86) on 64bit systems.)</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I’d imagine the files would be in the Source SDK Base 2007 folder in your steamapps(username) folder, but I could be wrong. Why do you need that, though?</p>

            <p>Inside steam, go to top menu.</p>
<p>Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Downloads + Cloud</p>
<p>Then change Download region to something else. Your region may be under heavy load.</p>
<p>I’d suggest getting it from Steam still, to keep it easy.</p>
