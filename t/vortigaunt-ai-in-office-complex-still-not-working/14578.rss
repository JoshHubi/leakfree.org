    <title>Vortigaunt AI (in Office Complex) STILL not working!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vortigaunt-ai-in-office-complex-still-not-working/14578</link>
    <description>The update made a bunch of my save files inoperable (AI disabled, visible triggers) so I loaded from an autosave in that weird swinging crate area. Anyway, I got to OC and everything was awesome and everybody&#39;s AI seemed to be working...until I saved that security guard from his headcrabbed friend turned zombie (&quot;one of these little buggers latched onto my friend&#39;s head&quot;). I got my Magnum, told the guard to come with, and then stepped out for the Vortigaunt ambush.

[b]Before the patch, in a later section of OC[/b], the Vorts would freeze up almost immediately, after firing maybe one burst of electricity if even that. They were literally frozen no movement.

[b]Now, with the patch and in this earlier section[/b], they do better but not well enough. The vortigaunt that appears in front of me will fire at and even chase me. The one below and on the left will fire once and then does not seem to want to do much more unless I get close and then he&#39;ll hit me. The third one, below on the right, will fire at me but with a lot of weird hesitation sometimes. When I kill his buddy down below he&#39;ll run forward. He&#39;ll sometimes just stare at me for a few seconds and then attack. It&#39;s weird they don&#39;t freeze up but they aren&#39;t consistently dynamic and aggressive.

Sorry for harping on this but it&#39;s a problem. Do you want a video?

Edit: not sure if this is important but I have the ST Uncut and On A Rail Loop mod installed. I also replaced the Vortigaunt sound-file with the old one (original HL sound). There are a few other cosmetic workshop add-ons but I doubt that&#39;s the problem.</description>
