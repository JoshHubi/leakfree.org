    <title>TES V announced at last - it&#39;s Skyrim!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tes-v-announced-at-last-its-skyrim/6004</link>
    <description>TES V: Skyrim has been announced by Todd Howard at the Spike Video Game Awards 2010.
The announcement involved little more than a short video presentation and the date: 11/11/11 - just eleven months from today. 

Finally Elder Scrolls 5!

<p>Seems that Bethesda’s shitty coding and the limitations of the PS3 are keeping really any DLC from being released for it.</p>

From the trailer it looks like you have a set type of house to build.  Where’s the variety in that?  Why would an evil necromancer want a cosy little home?  S/he’d want an evil castle of doom.</p>

<p>It’s really lame.  I love Beth open-world RPGs because I just love to go out into the world and adventure and survive.  Whenever I do concern myself with quests, they almost feel like a chore.  Their writing seems to me to be pretty consistently garbage (although bear in mind that I’ve only played games they’ve released since Oblivion), and the dragon quest is no exception.  You SPOILER [color=black]travel to Sovngarde to defeat Alduin, and the place is hugely disappointing because of how generic it is.  It just looks like another part of Skyrim.  Then you meet up with some poorly voiced, poorly written ancient Nord heroes and head out to fight Alduin, where there’s an absolutely cringe-worthy moment that was probably meant to be suspenseful where you have to use Clear Skies three times on Alduin’s Mist before he appears to fight you.  Then it’s pretty much a normal dragon fight without any exciting twists.</p>

<p>Fair points.  Of course, nothing you say is wrong or right.  You have your opinion and your points are valid.<br>
I have yet to play through the main dragon questline, so perhaps I am really in a bad position to judge.<br>
I don’t know how long I have played the game because I was playing on my brother’s computer whenever I was at his place.  I played it enough to complete the DB questline and the Imperial quests plus quite a few side quests, so I’m guessing I come in at 40 or so hours.  I deliberately didn’t take the main quest all the way because I wanted to wait until I got my own rig and my own copy of the game.</p>
<p>On a side note…I’ll never be able to get my own rig if my company doesn’t pay me the money they fucking owe me!  PAY UP BASTARDS!  It’s been 7 working days since I finished the job and now I want my money!</p>

            <p>The DB was the only guild in skyrim I enjoyed playing through, a lot. <strong>SPOILER</strong>[COLOR=‘Black’]I loved the part where you kill the couple at the party in Solitude, after I did that I ran out of the town, climbed the rocks right outside and jumped off the cliff all the way down into the water. It was awesome<strong>SPOILER</strong></p>
<p>I’ve yet to play through the imperial faction questline, but when I was fighting for the stormcloaks it seemed like every time I would get a reward that was way under any equipment I had at the time, but maybe it was because I did it later on.</p>
<p>The whole oblivion thing I was talking about was in more regards to the story, Oblivion gates were repetitive, but on the whole the main quest still managed to hold my interest throughout, enough so that I would stomach the obl gates, even if it meant speeding through some of them just to get the sigil stone, but dragons are pretty annoying half the time instead of fun - which is probably why I feel so strongly about them, because Dragons aren’t exactly new to the fantasy genre, and if it’s gonna be the focus of your story, it should at least be a little more engaging. Then again, that could be more of a fault of the combat system, that basically hasn’t really changed from oblivion except for better animations, dual wielding and killmoves that have horrendous clipping issues, and the fact that I usually go melee, and if you don’t have a large enough flat surface around you, a dragon that attacks you won’t be able to land, rendering you useless against him until you run a far distance to somewhere flat enough, and especially if you don’t have the better shouts.</p>
<p>It probably has a lot to do with my expectations. I really expected with all of Beth’s backlash from Oblivion, that they would make the beginning of the game easy enough, but there would be a lot of hardcore-rpg styled questing later on that would cater to people who like to be challenged in areas other than combat, as well as expecting your actions to have more consequence in the world (like how you become the leader of the TG and nobody even cares enough to talk to you, becoming a werewolf has basically no drawbacks whatsoever)</p>
<p>Again, I still love the game, just it’s lacking something that kept me playing the other ones. Also, I was actually more of a fan of selecting your skills, because I’m very indecisive when it comes to stats, but I always pick something that forces me to stick with whatever I’m currently doing - but with Skyrim you could go off and do anything, so In my second character I found myself constantly switching between different weapon types, unsure of what I wanted to focus on using</p>

            <p>And yet if you check the Steam achievements you’ll see that only 29% of people actually completed the Dark Brotherhood quest line and only 9% of people completed the whole of the Thieves Guild quest line.  That means that 91% of people haven’t even noticed how easy the Thieves Guild quests are.  Ahaha.<br>
Actually, I screwed up the first TG quest.  I’m not sure why it didn’t work.  I planted the ring in the guys pocket, but it never seemed to register as complete.  Either way, Brynjolf gives you quests after.</p>
<p>The Dark Brotherhood has 29 quests in Skyrim (plus unlimited optional) and in Oblivion there are 30 (plus 2 optional).<br>
Actually, I did think that Oblivion’s DB quests offered more ways to murder the contracts, but upon looking at the wiki for the Skyrim quests I’ve seen that Skyrim offers way more options when it comes to murder.<br>
For example, when you have to kill Vittoria Vici at her wedding I just shot an arrow into her face and was done with it.  It turns out that are 5 other ways to kill her, including having a statue fall on her head and crush her.  I didn’t even think such methods would be available.</p>
<p>The whole Cicero thing was amusing too.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried the Companions quests, so I can’t really comment on those.<br>
It is a shame that there is no Arena questline, but then it was hardly anything special in Oblivion either.</p>
<p>I see where you’re coming from, but I personally really don’t think Skyrim’s questlines are much worse than Oblivion.<br>
The defence of Whiterun and the storming of Winterhold were as fun as storming the Oblivion gates for me.  Plus, the Oblivion gates got a bit repetitive after closing the first 4 or 5.</p>

            <p>I didn’t say all of them, but most of them.</p>
<p>The guilds especially were a slap in the face. The Thieves guild did not require you to be proficient at sneaking at all, and even gave you missions where you were allowed to kill just because they were bandit guards, and all of them were way too short. <strong>SPOILER, sorta</strong>[COLOR=‘Black’]The Companions give you the ability to become a werewolf really fast with almost no effort at all required on the player’s part, and all the guilds were extremely short compared to previous games.</p>

</aside>
<p>Don’t worry, it wasn’t directed at you.  You just reminded me of these people.</p>
<p>I don’t think I entirely agree with you.  The quest where you get majorly drunk and keep having to uncover what you got up to on your bender is far more interesting than any quest chain I played in Oblivion or Morrowind.  You can hardly call it unoriginal.</p>

<p>Not sure if this was directed at me, but I don’t hate it at all, but every time I play it it just annoys me how simple every quest is, right down to even the daedric artifact quests, or how the writing is in general. I STILL barely played the main quest because the whole idea of Dragons just seems so uninteresting, whereas in Oblivion, at least the Daedra were of their own creation. It kept me much more invested in the story, even though the main quest wasn’t mind blowing or anything like that. Overall, even the general quests in previous titles were more engaging.</p>

<p>I’ll have to find it, but i think it had something to do with the near distance in an .ini or something.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay, you have to edit the fNearDistance=x and play with values in between 17-25. Lower values produce more Z-fighting, but higher values make objects disappear close to the camera, so try to find one that you find works well. I personally use fNearDistance=21</p>

            <p>Gonna wait. Judging from other people playing, it is not long enough nor does it provide nearly enough new content to justify a 20$ purchase.</p>
<p>I’m tired of skyrim anyway, considering 90% of the questlines have absolutely no depth compared to the other games and on top of that are very badly written, it makes it very hard for me to find a reason to keep playing when I’ve already played for 100+ of hours</p>
