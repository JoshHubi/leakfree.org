    <title>Strange Crash, no MDMP</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/strange-crash-no-mdmp/10184</link>
    <description>hi,

So far I&#39;ve been loving Black Mesa, well, except for this strange crash that&#39;s been repeatedly happening (at least 10 times) to me: 

After about 5-20 minutes of game-time (approx), my screen displays a single green, sometimes blue, horizontal streak, which is immediately followed by a screen of solid, slightly flickering/changing, black bars. My sound starts repeating the last 1/2 second of sound for a bit, then just goes to noise. it doesn&#39;t seem to ever stop, although one time I  was able to get task manager up, and kill the game. All other times, I&#39;ve  just had to reboot on crash. What&#39;s really strange is that there doesn&#39;t seem to be any MDMP file being created. I&#39;m looking in steam/steamapps/(my username)/source sdk base 2007, and there isn&#39;t a single mdmp file in sight. Also, this crash does not appear to be tied to specific spots-- after a crash, i can play through that area a dozen times and not have a single error.

OS: Windows 7, sp 1, 64 bit
Processor: Intel Core2 Duo CPU P8700 @ 2.53 GHz x2
RAM: 4 Gigs
Video Card: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4650

Any help would be greatly appreciated; I&#39;m itching to get back to playing Black Mesa!

            <p>I have had the same problem, no minidumps seen (unless they are somehow a hidden filetype by default?). I got all the way to the middle of Power Up in two sessions at the highest settings running like butter (except for lower antialiasing settings), turned on power, about to open doors to kill Gargantua, and saved my game. About two days later I start again, and after one minute I get blue or green diagonal artifacts, sound buzzing and a crash. Every time I have to do a hard shut down. I lowered graphics settings to the floor, and it still has the problem (but it tends to self-recover by grinding through a few times and I start on a rail before fatally crashing). Sometimes I can alt-tab out, sometimes I can’t. The game never posts a crash message, so I guess that explains the lack of a minidump.</p>
<p>I clean updated my Nvidia drivers, no real change at any graphics level. I am going to try starting a new game on Power Up and retracing my steps, maybe I corrupted my save file.</p>
<p>System specs:<br>
Genuine Windows 7 32-Bit SP1 fully updated<br>
Core 2 Duo E6600 2.4 GHz overclocked to ~2.8 GHz<br>
Nvidia 8800GTS ~350 MB GPU<br>
4GB Corsair RAM<br>
Sound Blaster XFI sound card<br>
EVGA 680i Mainboard<br>
WD 300GB HD</p>
<p>Update: New game did not change anything, crashed about two minutes into Power Up. I am considering a reinstall of SDK and BM. I don’t understand how I could play through half of this game at high settings but now I’m afraid my GPU is gonna burn itself out after two minutes even on the lowest settings.</p>

            <p>Okay. So, having just updated my drivers, I just got the longest playing session in so far, from a decent ways before the rocket launch, to right after I got captured. then i got the same crash, as highlighted above. Still no idea whats causing this</p>

            <p>Windows has been telling me it’s up-to-date, but I just went and downloaded some stuff anyways. It’s nearly dawn here, so I’m going to get some sleep now. thanks for the reply, I’ll be rechecking tomorrow.</p>
