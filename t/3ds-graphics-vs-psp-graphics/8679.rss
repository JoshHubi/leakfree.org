    <title>3DS Graphics vs PSP graphics</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/3ds-graphics-vs-psp-graphics/8679</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;ve got a PS Vita and I love it. It&#39;s a great system that just needs some more games.

The Vita&#39;s graphics are definitely a generation ahead of the PSPs. Nobody doubts it&#39;s graphical capabilities are practically the best of any portable gaming system out right now. 
As for the 3DS, from what I&#39;ve seen and heard it appears to have graphics somewhere around the level of the PSP&#39;s. I have a PSP, and I&#39;m well aware of the graphical capability of that system.

When comparing the 3DS and PSP graphically, which one has better visuals overall? I don&#39;t want to start a flame war, and I know that the quality of graphics can be subjective, but there are similar games for both of those systems which can be compared, right? They also have similar screen resolutions (referring to the 3DS&#39;s top screen).</description>

            <p>My favorite DS games have been 2D anyway, so it’s a moot point for me.</p>

            <p>I wonder when they’ll make a Metroid game for 3DS. Prime Hunters 2 would be cool</p>

            <p>^ this pretty much.</p>
<p>The lighting and shadows tend to look much better on the 3DS than on the PSP, and the poly count in the few games I have tend to be higher than anything I’ve seen on the PSP.  Both God of War games have the best graphics I’ve seen on the PSP, and the Resident Evil Revelations demo’s graphics look more impressive, IMO.</p>
<p>It’s pretty much like comparing a PS2 to a GameCube.  The PSP is slightly behind the PS2 in graphics, and I would say the 3DS is slightly ahead of the GameCube in graphics.  The GameCube generally had better looking games than the PS2.</p>

            <p>I’ve been looking around, from what I can tell, on a scale of 1 (PSP) to 10 (PSV) the 3DS can range between a 1-6, depending on the game. I guess it’s because the 3DS triumphs over the PSP in terms of technical specs. The more I think about it, the more the graphics seem like a cross between Wii and GCN… no wonder that’s the common consensus!</p>
<p>So… I suppose I’ve answered my own question.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Usually the best graphics come well into the life of a system as developers learn to utilize its power. I get the feeling the best has yet to come with the 3DS (and Vita).</p>

</aside>
<p>How superior are we talking? Are they impressive looking (edit: compared to the PSP)? On a scale of 1 to 10, PSP being 1 and Vita being ten, where’s the 3DS?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps a better question, are there any good PSP vs 3DS comparisons out there?</p>
