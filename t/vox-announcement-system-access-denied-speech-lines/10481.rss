    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vox-announcement-system-access-denied-speech-lines/10481</link>
    <description>I just realized VOX had a small amount of lines in BMS; i missed being able to hear male VOX while trying to open locked doors like in here:

i dont know if its nessessary, but is it possible to implement more vox voices throughout the game?

            <p>According to lead developer Raminator, there are prospects to include more VOX lines in future updates. The thread in which he discusses this can be found <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14251" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>We had a tool that analysed all of the content that the game used during runtime, so we could purge the unused stuff to trim the filesize down prior to release. Although it saved us about three gigabytes’ worth of data, it looks like the entity setup that the VOX system used didn’t make it through. We’ll have to address it in future updates.</p>

            <p>I really missed having the AI voice saying Access Denied and stuff like that, and having it announcing stuff along the course of the game. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>There’s probably reasons why it wasn’t included (maybe with one exception where I noticed it, though not sure if it was it), I have been missing out on news and on the forums and I’m not aware of what it was.</p>
<p>Sorry if someone already posted about this.</p>
<p>Still, I had fun! Great mod and great nostalgy it brought me.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>It has been brought up before (I inserted your newly created thread into an older one).</p>
<p>More information about the VOX announcement system can be found on the wiki:<br>
<a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/VOX_System" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/VOX_System</a></p>
<p>As for why; I guess it’s a design choice.  Maybe some developer can clarify.  I suppose you could argue it doesn’t make sense to hear a very loud “Access denied” over the intercom of the facility when you try to open a door you shouldn’t.</p>

            <p>Does it sounds familiar ? Great mod guys, but i have one question which is partially a complaint, why did you removed the “Acces Denied” error from the retinal scanner device ? I really loved it and im really surprised that noone has brought this up until now, it was something that belonged to Half life, and it was pretty awesome, it gave you a certain feeling that you are all alone and that you dont belong there or something like that, what do you guys think ?</p>

<p>will there be a patch that adds in more VOX lines, so it can be heard throughout the facility?  and will it use a sentence.txt system?  from what i recall, voicefiles for HECU and VOX were words that would be combined as according to sentence.txt</p>

<p>I can’t tell if you’re joking or not?</p>
<p>Either way, no - the developers have re-created Black Mesa in their vision.  You cannot expect things to be the same, and you cannot expect them to release patches to make Black Mesa more identical to Half-Life 1.</p>
<p>If you want to play a game that’s identical to Half-Life 1, you can play Half-Life 1.</p>
