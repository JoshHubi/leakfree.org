    <title>How do I edit .dmx files on the Steam version of Black Mesa?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-do-i-edit-dmx-files-on-the-steam-version-of-black-mesa/14358</link>
    <description>I have bought the Steam version of the game and I wanted to do some modifications to the weapons but the weapon files appears to be in .dmx format. When I try to open them with notepad I see no text inside although they have a file size. Can someone tell me how I open and modify them? It should be possible because in the workshop I have seen other mods that seems to alter the same files. If anyone has any ideas or suggestion I would appreciate it a lot (also, if there&#39;s a better place to post this question on this forum please tell me where to do so).</description>

            <p>I’ve tried now and I can’t extract any further files once they are in .dmx format. What exactly did you mean by that? Which vpk-files were I meant to extract them from?</p>
<p>Which text editor should I use then? I tried Wordpad and Notepad but the files appear empty.</p>
<p>Edit: I have now found that the .dmx files of other peoples mods work as they should. For example, if I download the “More accurate shotgun” mod and open it, then the weapon_shotgun dmx-file inside will work perfectly and the text can be seen. But if I extract the same files from the Black Mesa I have installed on my computer, then those files will appear completely empty even though they have a file size. Does anyone know why that is the case?</p>

            <p>Extract them and open them with a text editor, should work fine!</p>
