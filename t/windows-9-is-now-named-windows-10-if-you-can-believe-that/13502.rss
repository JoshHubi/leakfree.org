[quote]
Microsoft is officially unveiling the name for the next release of Windows today: Windows 10. While the software maker had referred to Windows 9 as codename Windows Threshold internally, today’s official naming puts any rumors of Windows, Windows TH, Windows X, and Windows One to bed. It’s simply Windows 10, marking a jump from the mixed reception of Windows 8.

<p>If the people violating my privacy are strangers and I don’t have a reason to believe they’re doing it maliciously I don’t care. I’m a little touchier if it’s people I know, but not too much so. So yeah, in both cases, as long as the violation was restricted to strangers I’d care very little. I mean I doubt I’d do it without getting paid for it, but you wouldn’t have to pay me all that much.</p>
<p>For example, one of my housemates keeps leaving the blinds and window open in our bathroom. There’s a large house with windows angled just such that anyone in the house can see you on the can if they care to look. At first I kept putting the blinds down, but after a little while I realized putting the blinds down every time the culprit leaves them up is more work than it’s worth. So now I shit shower and piss in relatively plain view to the house across the alley.</p>

            <p>Well they openly admit it in the EULA, but nobody reads it so just a heads up. I’m just repeating the advice from some of the smartest tech experts on the internet. They always advise not to use a beta OS without its own dedicated pc or virtual machine, with keylogger or without.</p>

            <p>I think they care too much about the build number. It’s not like the new Source engine is officially called Source 5 (just because the build number is 5595)</p>
<p>Also apparently Windows 10 official beta has a keylogger inside, so unless you want microsoft recording your keystrokes, don’t run the beta as your daily driver just yet. Unless there is some keylogger removal tool online that works on windows 10.</p>

<p>Or maybe they’re trying to piss us off. But unfortunately they have failed miserably.</p>

</aside>
<p>I can understand why someone with little develouper knowledge wouldn’t understand their reasoning for naming the next version of Windows, Windows 10. However, they named them after the build numbers. Not the release.</p>
<p>In actuality there’s 21 different official (meaning complete and released to market) consumer versions of Windows. Even more if you count the enterprise/server editions.</p>
<p>However, the name ‘Windows 10’ actually makes perfect sense. By that time, the build number for the Operating system will reach ‘Windows NT 6.5 Build 10000’ of course it will change over time. As every single hotfix, or tiny update changes the Windows build number.</p>
<p>Technically - Windows 8, should have been called ‘Windows 9’ because Windows 8’s original build number was ‘9200’. Windows 8.1 moved that up to ‘Build 9600’. That’s why inside Microsoft, they were trying to keep the build number under 9xxx, so it could remain true to the fact that this, was indeed, Windows Build <span class="hashtag">#8</span>. But they missed that target due to internal hotfixes before the official RTM release.</p>
<p>I remember downloading Windows 8 (two years ago now), right when it hit the ‘Gold Master’ mark. Someone leaked it on the internet, and I got it in early August. 3 months before it hit shelves. The build number for GM was, ironically, ‘Windows NT 6.4 Build 8888’ but when the RTM build hit the torrents in late September, it had been bumped up to ‘9200’.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you get my point. They are naming them after build numbers again - like they did back in Windows 3.1 days  :rolleyes: . That’s why ‘Windows 7’ was called ‘Windows 7’. Because it’s build number was ‘Windows NT 6.3 Build 7100’</p>
