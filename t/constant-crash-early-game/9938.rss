    <title>Constant Crash early game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/constant-crash-early-game/9938</link>
    <description>Shortly after I get the crowbar and see the zombie transformation scene, I head through the door and get the loading screen as expected. Then the game crashes. Attached are two separate crash reports.&lt;a class=&#39;attachment&#39; href=&#39;/uploads/default/original/2X/a/aa73a7338e7f19fe51beaef1f28c3faa75b444e8.mdmp&#39;&gt;hl2_4104_crash_2012_9_15T17_47_9C0.mdmp&lt;/a&gt; (74.9 KB)

Please help. Have enjoyed the game so far. Also, unrelated, I am having some texture difficulties, probably related to having to run DirectX 8.1 on my hardware... Basically, almost everyone&#39;s eyes are checkered purple and black and the radioactive waste is too. Any advice would be helpful.</description>
