    <title>A Release Date Has Been Set!!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-release-date-has-been-set/8577</link>
    <description>I&#39;m glad to announce that a release date has been set, and verified, through the appropriate authorities. 

It&#39;s been a long time coming and I&#39;m sure most all of you will be anxious to jump on board and carry the word to those less fortunate to be members of this site. 

Thanks go to the entire team, sponsors and emailers for their help in contributing to the release and to those in charge who were able to make it a reality.

For further information concerning my release from Cell Block 17, contact my attorney or check your local newspapers.

Thanks Again!

CPU
