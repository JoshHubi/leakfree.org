    <title>Dialogue Bug?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dialogue-bug/11797</link>
    <description>I noticed that in part where you first meet the Ichthyosaur and receive the cross bow, the scientist in the control room is supposed to have a dialogue scene, however it is not playing on my game. 

this is the only dialogue bug I have found in the whole game. (Even the 2 scientists and Barney  trapped in a pipe room during the teleportation labs area had funny and different dialogue)

I believe the scientist is supposed to say something like,

&quot;Did you see it? They said it was hauled from the &#39;Challenger Deep&#39;. I swear that thing never swam in Terrestrial Waters til a week ago.&quot;</description>
