    <title>Making a DVD</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/making-a-dvd/4077</link>
    <description>Alright. I have three files with file extensions Windows, nor I, know what to do with. However, I DO know they are supposed to go on a CD, but most likely after something (decompression/unpacking) is done to them. The files are:

MLB2K10.I00
MLB2K10.I01
MLB2K10.MDS

All help is greatly appreciated.  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>I00: The first file of a group of disk image files saved by DVD Shrink; designed to fit a DVD-Video disc on a single DVD-R disc; usually saved as part of a sequence of files, i.e. “.I00, .I01, .I02, etc.”</p>
<p>Use DVD Shrink and burn the mds file, it will ask you for several disks (in this case 2)</p>

            <p>Something like Alcohol 120 or Magic ISO should do the job. Not sure what the I00 and I01 extensions are, I only know what MDS is but it might as well just work!</p>
<p>I’m convinced however that Google would point you to what you need.</p>
