    <title>Chapter 10 conveyer belt crushers</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/chapter-10-conveyer-belt-crushers/10651</link>
    <description>Probably is a bug and if this can help people stuck on it like i was.

So the crushers seem to get out of sync if you start hanging around them or you die alot on them and keep spawning at last checkpoint.

Since i was doing this for about an hour and they started to get out of sync so it was impossible to get past even the first 3. But then i reset at the start of the chapter and ran back to them and i flew past them first try.

So to anyone being stuck on them just walk in to the crusher when its going up and keep pushing forward to it with sprint and it lets you past with no problems what so ever.</description>
