    <description>Hey,

The very first Houndeye you encounter in the game, the one who jumps out of a window, turns invisible if you hit him with the crowbar while he&#39;s still in that animation and hasn&#39;t turned on his regular AI behaviour yet. He&#39;s still there, still does damage, can still take damage etc. I tried it a few times and the same thing happened.</description>
