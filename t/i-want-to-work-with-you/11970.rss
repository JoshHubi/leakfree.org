    <description>Hi!

I love the 3d modeling and I want to contribute to the project blackmesa.

I studied game design and development engineering, my passion is computer generated graphics and I want and need to work with people I keep learning.

Please contact me for work!

Thanks</description>

            <p>Crypt19 is right. You might try to send a email but if you haven’t done anything before, it’s not likely you’ll be picked.</p>

            <p>Think you got the wrong section. Test Chamber is for contributions to the mod you’ve already made and would like to submit. There’s also a <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/General_FAQ#Jobs_.7C_Contact_Us" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">wiki page</a> for this topic, but considering the game is out I wouldn’t imagine they need new team members, but who knows.</p>
