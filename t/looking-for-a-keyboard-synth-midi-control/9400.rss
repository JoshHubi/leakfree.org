    <title>Looking for a keyboard (synth/midi control)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-for-a-keyboard-synth-midi-control/9400</link>
    <description>Not sure how many of you are musicians, but I&#39;m looking for a keyboard. Here are the things I&#39;m looking for:

* Midi control (USB in addition to midi output would be nice)
* Included synths
* Realistically weighted key action
* 49 key minimum
* $700 or less, preferably
* Studio and stage use


I&#39;ve been doing lots of searching and a lot of the boards that strike my interest seem to be out of production. If any of you use a board you really enjoy that even kind of fits the bill, let me know.</description>
