    <title>worthwhile cpu upgrade?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/worthwhile-cpu-upgrade/6522</link>
    <description>&#39;Sup guys.

So someone I know is selling his AMD Phenom II x4 945, it caught my eye. Thing is, I&#39;m wondering how much a  worthwhile upgrade it would be from what I have at the moment;

Phenom II x2 550 Black Edition 
Running as a tri-core @3.6Ghz (stock 3.1)

I&#39;d be running a smaller overclock, if at all, for the equivalent performance, and I&#39;d be getting an extra core. It&#39;s 3 months old, comes with all the standard stuff(cooler bscly), and he&#39;s asking £45 / $75usd.

            <p>you crazy bidders…</p>
<p>It was £11.50 when I went to bed, wake up, it’s a £70. No bidding war, just some guy placing a bid of +£30 then +£10 right afterwards. :S Strange.</p>
<p>3 days left on the auction, and I’m already £20 in profit! :retard:</p>

            <p>Because I’m selling it as it was intended to be sold, simple as that.</p>
<p>A guy has already offered me £75 inc. shipping for the cpu only…but that would leave me £10 undernearth my ‘buy it now’, paying shipping out of my own pocket, and with a fairly worthless cpu cooler which I probably wouldn’t be able to sell. So I told him to ‘jog on’ as it were.</p>
<p>It’s been up just over a day on eBay, with another 3 1/2 to go.</p>
<p>And I’ve had 1 firm offer, a few bids, and 13 watchers. So I’m sure I’ll get a decent price for the whole lot.</p>

            <p>Well He’s a regular on a forum I’m a regular on, I’ve had plenty of discussions with him. But a close friend, he’s not. So morally, I’d have no problems selling it.</p>
<p>I guess the decision to sell it isn’t something you guys can really help with, but thanks for all the replies  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I don’t think its a dickish move to flip it… you buy it its yours, your friend got the money he wanted for it.</p>
<p>As for whether or not its worth it for future proofing, I don’t think so. Most likely any game that can play on 4 cores should do fine with 3 for the forseeable future. But enjoy it, the 945BE is a good processor.</p>

            <p>Well is this someone you know a good friend of yours or just someone who wanted to sell it. It’d be kinda dickish to sell something a friend sold you cheap for a profit.</p>
<p>Friend “Oh hey how is that new processor working for ya?”<br>
You “Oh… I sold it for profit”<br>
Friend "Oh  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> "</p>
<p>If not it depends on how much you can sell it for.  Now its a question of opportunity cost.  The price to upgrade your cpu is now the loss from paying for the cpu and the lost opportunity to sell the new one.</p>
<p>10-15 is certainly a good upgrade but is 40-50? Up to you.</p>
<p>Also what of it sersoft :3</p>

            <p>That’s bullshit. One year on, my cpu is almost exactly the same price*. It’s reached it price floor. Sure, I’d dream of being able to pick up a quad core 3Ghz cpu for $40, but it’s just not happening anywhere in the nearish future.</p>
<p>The price here still seems damn good to me. So I looked around, and if I sell my current processor to raise funds, I could possibly break even out of all this, and have a better cpu in the end. What’s not to like there? O__O</p>
<p>I reckon I’m going to go for it. We’ll see.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘DimGray’]*the x2 550BE is no longer in production, it was replaced last year by the x2 555. I remember looking around at the time, and the general feeling was that it was hotter, more expensive, but gave little extra performance over the 550BE. Even if you look at second hand 550BE’s, I could still make back the money I spend buying this.</p>

<p>Chances are that in a years time you’ll be able to get that PIIx4 for half that price. Or something better for those $75. If you want longevity, invest in gold or something.</p>

            <p>If its cheap buy it, but you won’t see a massive impovement with that CPU though. Next upgrade for me is when the new AMD CPU’s are out.</p>
<p>That means a new mobo by the looks of things if I want Bulldozer… <em>sigh</em></p>

            <p>Okay then. Financially, I could probably set aside the money to buy it, anyway, selling on my 550BE would go a good deal of the way to cover the cost.</p>
<p>I’m pretty happy with my CPU atm, it does everything admirably. But it’s about the longer term. 3.6Ghz and 3 cores is as high as I can clock it it seems, and I’m sure a year down the line, I’d be less satisfied. With something like this I could save having to overclock for a later date. For me it’s about the longevity, will an upgrade now save me having to spend more next year for example</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>

            <p>lol I dunno, do you want more speed and are you willing to spend the price?</p>
<p>These are question you should ask yourself, we don’t know your financial situation nor your general level of satisfaction towards your current CPU.</p>
