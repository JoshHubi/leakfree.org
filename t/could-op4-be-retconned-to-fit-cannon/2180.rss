    <title>Could Op4 be retconned to fit cannon?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/could-op4-be-retconned-to-fit-cannon/2180</link>
    <description>Okay, I know there are people working on making Opposing force using the source engine. There are also various fans who clamor for Adrian Shephard to make a return. The major point that constantly is contested is that Valve hasn&#39;t accepted Race X as cannon and if they brought Adrian Shephard back, they&#39;d be forced to accept Race X as cannon by association.

However I was wondering if this really needed to be the case. What if Opposing Force was retconned when it was redone? COULD it be retconned? As a little thought experiment, I thought about what the different Race X creatures really accomplished and what they could be replaced by that IS part of Half Life cannon.

[url=&#39;https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Pit_Drone&#39;]Pit Drone[/url] - These were essentially the Vortigons of Race X

[url=&#39;https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Shock_Trooper&#39;]Shock Trooper[/url] - essentially the Alien Grunts of Race X

[url=&#39;https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Shock_Roach&#39;]Shock Roach[/url] - These have no counterpart, but might be substituted in certain situations by having a few more snark traps scattered around.

[url=&#39;https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Voltigore&#39;]Voltigore[/url] - these have no counterpart in HL1 that I can think of, but HL2 provides an excellent substitution with the Ant Lion Guardians. Obviously they would lack the long range attacks of the Voltigore, but would make up for it by being much harder to kill. Obviously having every Voltigore replaced with an Ant Lion Guardian would be a bit much, but the Acid Ant Lions bring in the long range attack that the Guardian lacks while still being easier to kill. The baby voltigores could be replaced with regular Ant Lions. 
Even if Valve felt that this SHOULDN&#39;T be how Ant Lions got into earth&#39;s ecosystem, that gets wrapped up neatly by the Nuke at the end of the game, which can be said to have wiped out that crop of ant lions, but then another group of antlions entered earth&#39;s ecosystem at some other time period.

[url=&#39;https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Pit_Worm&#39;]Pit Worm[/url] - This was essentially the Tentacles of Race X. Lets face it, the entire scenario was practically a carbon copy of the part in HL1 where you roast the Tentacles with the Jet thruster testing area. Obviously the section would need to be drastically reworked in order to make it still play properly, but having two sets of tentacles that come out of pipes that stick out above the toxic waste could then be flooded and killed by the toxic waste level raising the same way.

[url=&#39;https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Gonome&#39;]Gonom[/url] - Again HL1 offers no real substitution, but Episode 1 shows that regular headcrab can use grenades when they take over combine, so if headcrabs take over military in Op4, you could claim that they can use grenades too while also having the body armor protection. It wouldn&#39;t directly replace the gonoms, but it might help balance areas towards that.

[url=&#39;https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Gene_Worm&#39;]Gene Worm(final boss)[/url] - this is the only one I don&#39;t have a clear idea for replacing. Theoretically, you might be able to throw in an advisor or something and claim that it was a frontal scout for the combine. At that point Adrian Shephard may have played an unknown part in keeping the combine forces at bay, but also being responsible for how well prepared the combine forces were to deal with Earth&#39;s military force when they attacked during the 7 hour war.

[url=&#39;https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Ops&#39;]Male Assassins/Black Ops[/url] - I don&#39;t think this would NEED to be changed, but if Valve was feeling particularly anal retentive, the assassins/black ops could just be made so that they were all female. At that point the female assassins/black ops would need to be allowed to use other weapons, since the combat did change drastically. (grenades, smg, and sniper rifles)

[url=&#39;https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Spore_Launcher&#39;]Spore Launcher[/url] - There&#39;s no clear indication that this is connected to Race X, or for that matter even connected to Xen. I don&#39;t think leaving this in would break cannon.

So do people think these substitutions would allow Opposing Force to be treated as cannon? Is there anything else that would need to be revamped for cannon purposes? Would it still be fun to play even without the &quot;new&quot; enemies to fight? Could all the various levels be balanced properly? Would it make the game better or worse? I&#39;m curious what other&#39;s think, or if people have given any thought to this at all.</description>

<p>“racex was purely a gearbox creation that doesn’t figure at all in my thinking about the world. Understand, they wanted to come up with a set of creatures that would create gameplay they knew how to make. They could have been making an original title or an add-on for some other franchise, and plugged racex into that–the reason being that they had gameplay they wanted to explore and needed the freedom of their own race of critters to conduct those experiments with. If gearbox had kept making hl games, i suppose we might have seen these threads develop. Since blackops are not a gearbox creation per se, but an opportunistic use of existing real-life elements, i don’t see how the idea of canon applies to them.”</p>
<p>As a purely gearbox creation, we will never see them again. aka, they effectively don’t exist. you fought them in op4 but they have never been seen before and will never be seen afterward. Stuff from the story, like the nuke or barney or the black ops, they were valve. This is why the the canon thing is pointless. because they were not a valve creation, they don’t factor in. No mater how much you love the enemies or want to see them again, Valve has decided to never go there again. So the fan argument of “I fought them in op4 so they must be canon” means nothing to the writers and creators of the franchise and universe. They are not part of the combine despite what fans want. They are not from xen because we never see them there. Shepard, race x, the worms ect are there and only there on op4. This is not meant to be a slight to shepard fans, only a dose of reality. Now that valve has the resources to do all the expansions in house, unused gearbox stuff has gone by the wayside. Enjoy the game for what it is and all that it will ever be.</p>

            <p>Although Op4 is horrible story wise, I suppose it could be stretched that Race X were the combine… Wasn’t the Gene-worm supposed to absorb Earth’s resources, more or less was the combies do?</p>
<p>Meh, i’d say let sleeping dogs lie, Opposing force isn’t canon according to VALVe so we shouldn’t be mentioning it. Until the time Shepherd shows up in some future game and some 12 year old kid squeels, “OMg dem fags on Balck Meas said I was ghey… I was leet.”</p>

            <p>You guys are missing the obvious easy way out for most of this. The aliens in OP4 are from a different part of Xen, like there are different animals in different environments on Earth, same with Xen. If you don’t like that, the OP4 aliens are from a different branch of the Xen invasion army, like Army and Air Force.<br>
Feel free to bash, I haven’t read most of the thread or anything linked in it, just posting thoughts.</p>

<p>the concept of canon, as laid down by marc laidlaw is a fan boy invention. Do not concern yourself with it, as it is nothing. Enjoy the games for what they are, nothing more.</p>

</aside>
<p>I didnt say they contradict anything, I just like to see it from both sides. I like to think of OP4 as connon because I enjoy playing it, so knowing all the cons helps you with your own counter arguments for it being connon.</p>
<p>But like it says in Johnworfins post above it will only become true cannon if and when Valve decide it to be.</p>
<p>Any way like I said, Im just figuring out if OP4 can <span class="bbcode-b">potentially</span> fit into cannon. And so far in my own opinion it can.</p>

<p>Just do the mod, it is a piece of fan fiction, regardless of the cannon or not stuff. If you like the character or the game, just do it. It is only a story. Just think of the 20 years of “official” star wars fiction that went by the wayside when lucas decided to rape his own story.</p>

<p>In the Marc Laidlaw vault that was so generously linked for us, he repeatedly discusses the concept of canon. He does not care. it does not factor in his job or other games he is working on. he has repeatedly stated that the gearbox expansions stand on their own and certain things, like the nuking of black mesa and barney, because they appeared in later games are part of the VALVE story. anything else was artistic license from gearbox. According to Marc,  valve wanted to have the marines be “The Bad Guys” in op4, but gearbox wanted a good main character. Because of this, and numerous other little details, the gearbox story has never been progressed. In what seems to be an effort to placate shepard fans, he has stated that the gearbox story line is deliberately left ambiguous in case they want to revisit the story later. But they won’t, because valve was not happy with the aliens (race x) in op4. He also went on to discuss how the stories are made from game to game, with little story arc and with lots of customer feedback, so contradictions between valve titles are already there, and he does not want to be forced to work within a story line someone else wrote.So, as it has been stated numerous times here, if it appeared in a later valve title, it is part of the story line and if it has not, then let it go, unless valve decides to use it at a later date. and if you are desperately bent on the concept of canon you should read the bible, it’s the real good news <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
