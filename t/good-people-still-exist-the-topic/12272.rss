    <title>Good People Still Exist (The Topic)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/good-people-still-exist-the-topic/12272</link>
    <description>Considering all of the pitch black awful things that have happened so far this week, and kind of the last few years in general, I&#39;d like to have a thread dedicated to good, kind, heartwarming, and otherwise nice things. But let&#39;s try to keep this to actual good things being done so we don&#39;t just have a thread dedicated to pictures of kittens.

            <p>Dudes are trying to do their jobs, but get flooded by Pizzas.</p>
<p>And, depending on how many people actually participate, there will be way too many pizzas and most of them will end up in the bin untouched.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s trolling if you make them pay for it. But if you buy somebody pizza, that should be a good thing, right?</p>

            <p>It depends on how you look at it. A friend of mine did that to people who pissed him off on the internet, he obtained their information and ordered a pizza for them… I dunno how he got the contact info, but he did.</p>

            <p>How is ordering a metric ton of pizza for police officers an act of trolling? I’m confused…</p>
