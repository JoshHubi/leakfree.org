    <title>A Few Bugs</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-few-bugs/13896</link>
    <description>First off, I just want to say that I am enjoying the Steam release so far, it&#39;s great to see all the improvements being made to the game. However, there are quite a few issues. I haven&#39;t made it that far in yet, but I thought I would go ahead and post these. I&#39;ll post more later as I find them.

DX Level 9

Graphics settings:
Model Detail = Medium
Texture Detail = Medium
Shader Detail = High
Water = Reflect All
Shadows = Low
Color Correction = Enabled
Ant-Aliasing = 0
Anisotropic Filtering = 2X
Wait for vertical sync = Enabled
Motion Blur = On
HDR = Full

BM Settings:
Blobby Shadows = on

Sprint funkiness: If you switch to the pistol and then quickly sprint, the sprint animations derp out for a second.

Ties: The ties on scientists and guards go completely apeshit. I think this may be related to framerate as this only happens on my laptop but not my desktop.

[b]Anomalous Materials[/b]

Disappearing flasks: The flasks in this cabinet randomly vanish in plain sight for no apparent reason.

[b]Unforeseen Consequences[/b][/size][/size][/size]

Strange floor glitchiness + server chunks vanishing: I&#39;m not really sure what caused this. Happened on my laptop but not my desktop.

Tank feet: These tanks in UC just after you escape the AM labs look great, but there&#39;s no geometry on the bottom of the feet, which wouldn&#39;t be a problem except for this one laying on its side.

Ceiling Tiles: It&#39;s entirely too easy to get up into the ceiling here where you&#39;re treated to a wonderful view of nodraw.

See though: Just inside the vent you can see through the edge of the hole.

A lot of these may have already been reported, if so I apologize for repeating.
