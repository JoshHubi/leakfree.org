    <title>Steam shitting itself up</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-shitting-itself-up/8272</link>
    <description>A couple of weeks ago, some games from my Steam list dissapeared. I contacted the Steam support, and this is what they told me to do:

[indent][i]Hello,

A staff member has replied to your question:

Hello Antoine,

Thank you for contacting Steam Support.

Please exit Steam and go to the folder called C:\Program Files\Steam\ (this is the default location for a Steam installation - if you set a different installation directory, you will need to browse to it).

Delete all of the contents of this folder except:

The Steamapps folder and Steam.exe (If &#39;exe&#39; is not visible, look for the black and white Steam icon)

Restart your computer.

Then, you will need to launch Steam.exe from within the Steam installation folder, and not from a pre-existing shortcut. 

With Steam running, re-test the original issue.

Note: This process will not affect your currently installed games.[/i][/indent]

So I did it, and it worked. But ever since, all of my icons in my Steam game list disappeared, and the store page messes up real bad:

The store thing is intermittent though.

Anybody knows how to fix this?</description>

<p>I have most Steam games. Some publishers can elect to keep their games, or certain games, off of the press list, but tonnes of them don’t care.</p>
<p>At the moment I have over 1,000 games. It’s hard to get an exact number because Steam isn’t quite consistent when it comes to counting expansions and DLC packs.</p>

<p>Back when he was writing for GN and Planet Unreal, he got his account flagged as a press account.  I dunno if he’s still writing for either, but I’m guessing the flag was never taken off of his account  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
(that, or he spends way too much money on Steam)</p>
