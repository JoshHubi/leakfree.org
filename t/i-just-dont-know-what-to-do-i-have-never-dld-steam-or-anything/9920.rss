            <p>Did you install the mod itself? I recommend the torrent <a href="https://release.blackmesasource.com/pages/download_manager.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. You can double click the .exe here and it will install the mod for you.</p>

            <p>Install Steam (go here <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/Steam" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://store.steampowered.com/Steam</a> and in top right side of the screen there is green button Install Steam). Create a Steam account (username and password). Download Black Mesa, install it, and it should automatically find your Steam folder and install Black Mesa in the correct place. And if you try to play Black Mesa without installing Source SDK Base 2007 then I think Steam will automatically download and install the SDK Base for you. (I can’t test that myself though as I already had installed.)</p>
