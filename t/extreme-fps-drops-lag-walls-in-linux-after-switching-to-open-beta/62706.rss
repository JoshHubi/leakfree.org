    <title>Extreme FPS drops, &quot;Lag Walls&quot; in Linux after switching to Open Beta</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/extreme-fps-drops-lag-walls-in-linux-after-switching-to-open-beta/62706</link>
    <description>I played through the whole game as it currently exists in the main Steam branch with no unfixable, not already documented errors.  After credits scrolled I decided to look up the status of the Xen beta to find out the full play-through had been pushed to the Open Beta branch just the day before!

I had to delete the `glshaders.cfg` file to get the Beta to load.

I noticed the FPS issue at the first Xen title sequence, but the game was totally still playable for a while.  I posted in Discord about it as well:

&gt; I also have the FPS issue, running `Ubuntu 18.04.1` 
&gt; It seems to be location based.  I first hit the &#39;lag wall&#39; at the same time the chapter text Xen appears on screen, and the music starts.
&gt; If I keep walking forward when the speed returns everything is fine.  If I go back into the cave I hit the lag wall all over again.  And a third time when I leave the cave again

I dropped my graphics settings to as low as I could get them, and attempted to modify the `mat_queue_mode` setting, but couldn&#39;t figure out where it needed to be set.

Here&#39;s a collection of screenshots I took with `+showbudget_texture` enabled:

Here&#39;s a pastebin of everything in my console: https://pastebin.com/HsTidbBn
Here&#39;s the status and getpos results:

Edit:
Here&#39;s some info about my system:

    $ uname -a
    Linux Wheatley 4.18.0-25-generic #26~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 27 07:28:31 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Results for 

    $ sudo lshw &gt; lshw.txt
https://pastebin.com/9VaHqCFT

Edit 2:
I noticed I have two Black Mesa folders in `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/`.  One is `Black Mesa/` and the other is `Black mesa/`.
`Black Mesa/` is the main folder, while `Black mesa/`&#39;s files all share a timestamp of when I updated to the Beta branch:

    $ ls -al
    total 44
    drwxr--r-- 3 aaron aaron  4096 Dec  7 21:42 .
    drwxr--r-- 3 aaron aaron  4096 Dec  7 21:42 ..
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 aaron aaron   925 Dec  7 21:42 gamestate.txt
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 aaron aaron 13179 Dec  7 21:42 glshaders.cfg
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 aaron aaron  4422 Dec  7 21:42 modelsounds.cache
    drwxr--r-- 2 aaron aaron  4096 Dec  7 21:42 sound
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 aaron aaron     0 Dec  7 21:42 stats.txt
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 aaron aaron     4 Dec  7 21:42 voice_ban.dt

No idea if this is intentional or related, but figured it&#39;s worth noting

Edit 3:
Ran another test, this time starting the game from CLI, here&#39;s logs:
https://pastebin.com/Hdz4Rpex

I was running HTOP at the time, the game was making use of multi-threading at first, but after hitting the wall a single core was at 100% and the rest were low util.
I noticed two `matqueue0` processes pretty high on the CPU usage list when first starting, but they seemed to disappear after the wall.

More system information--
I don&#39;t believe this is a strict graphics driver issue; the GPU even works on Folding@Home
But in case it is anyway,

Are there other logs that might prove useful?  
Should I try to capture kernel logs during a test?</description>
