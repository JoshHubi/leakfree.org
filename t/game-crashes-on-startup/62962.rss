    <title>Game crashes on startup</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-on-startup/62962</link>
    <description>I bought the game about 2 days ago on steam. I&#39;ve played through the first 2 chapters with no problems. Today, I tried to start the game, but it crashed on startup, during the Crowbar Collective splash screen. I&#39;ve tried everything I&#39;ve seen online. Reinstalling, verifying cache files, going into launch options and setting -autoconfig or -window. The only minor issue I seemed to have at the start was a bit of a heavy gpu load. But it didn&#39;t seem to important, every other game works fine. What should I do?</description>

            <p>I will post several developer recommended fixes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Uninstall ALL Mods, no exceptions.<br>
Verify the game files afterwards and quit using the old saves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your saved game could be corrupt.Quit using it and restart the chapter from the new game menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revert to the old menu.<br>
Right-click the game in Steam, select “Properties”, and in the General tab select “Set Launch Options”. Type “-oldgameui” in the launch config.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try Launching the game with:<br>
-forceuid3d9<br>
in the launch options.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional tips<br>
Disable free gpu tuner software ie Afterburner, Rivatuner</p>
