    <title>Some Interesting Things I Found</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-interesting-things-i-found/2550</link>
    <description>I was recently going through boxes and I found some [b][i]interesting things.[/i][/b]

First I found a Red Rider BB Gun-it&#39;s the real thing too. I&#39;m slightly afraid to use it for fear of having my eye shot out.

Next I found a German SA and Hitlers youth knife-I honestly have no idea why I have these, but I&#39;m glad I do.

The last [b][i]mildly interesting[/i][/b] thing I found was an untitled book from the 1900&#39;s-it&#39;s a pretty good book from what I&#39;ve read so far. It&#39;s about a guy living in Chicago during that time. It&#39;s pretty cool, it doesn&#39;t have any plot, it just sort of goes through events in his life. Very naturalistic.

Go through boxes and post what you find. They might be [i][b]interesting[/b][/i].</description>

<p>You sir, have found yourself what is called a <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">diary</span></span>.</p>
<p>Also, you should have an expert look at that if you think the book itself is interesting; I’m sure you’ll find the expert’s opinion also just as interesting.</p>

            <p>I was recently going through boxes and I found some <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">interesting things.</span></span></p>
<p>First I found a Red Rider BB Gun-it’s the real thing too. I’m slightly afraid to use it for fear of having my eye shot out.</p>
<p>Next I found a German SA and Hitlers youth knife-I honestly have no idea why I have these, but I’m glad I do.</p>
<p>The last <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">mildly interesting</span></span> thing I found was an untitled book from the 1900’s-it’s a pretty good book from what I’ve read so far. It’s about a guy living in Chicago during that time. It’s pretty cool, it doesn’t have any plot, it just sort of goes through events in his life. Very naturalistic.</p>
<p>Go through boxes and post what you find. They might be <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">interesting</span></span>.</p>
