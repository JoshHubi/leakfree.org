    <title>Unable to change keyboard controls</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unable-to-change-keyboard-controls/10702</link>
    <description>Hello there mister Black Mesa sir.

Basically, I use DVORAK, and I have a quick little shortcut to switch between DVORAK and QWERTY. No game I have ever played has had a problem with this, apart from Black Mesa.

Usually I can just switch to QWERTY and it&#39;ll be fine. Worse case scenario is that I just have to remap the controls, but no matter what, even after remapping controls or switching to QWERTY or whatever Black Mesa will always use the default QWERTY controls and treat my keyboard like it&#39;s in constant DVORAK so it&#39;s completely unplayable.

The one work around for this is going all the way into my regional and language settings, and changing to QWERTY. Obviously this is a big problem, since anyone with a foreign, or otherwise different keyboard layout, is unable to play this game. Not only that, but remapping keys is totally whack anyway,  and not being able to remap your keys is a terrible thing on any PC game, never mind a Source game.

Anyway, peace out.</description>

<p>And what about trying to remap then by editing config.cfg (as a kind-of workaround)? There’s a set of “bind …” commands at the top of this file which you could try modifying to check if the problem is with binding working incorrectly or with the vgui keyboard controls change dialog being bugged.</p>

            <p>I said in my first post, I already have a work-around but the point is that it’s rather annoying and I can’t remap my controls at all. You can see a different key in the options box, but the controls don’t change in game.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also just found out that clicking “use default” stops all keys from responding.</p>

<p>Definitely Black Mesa only. Everything works fine on any other Source games, and recently, including TF2, Portal 2, Half Life 2, ect… Maybe you just need to insert a 2 somewhere in the name to get it working.</p>

</aside>
<p>If “2” is a key point here then you should have problems in HL: Source. That’s might be a “Black Mesa Keyboard Curse” then :-). Being serious, it really seems pretty strange to me. What could you try to do is to temporarily remove DVORAK layout from the system, then log off, log back on and try starting up Steam and Black Mesa. It might help you to get in-game input working properly but still doesn’t explains what is the problem with BM.</p>

            <p>Do you have the same problems in other Source-based games? AFAIK Black Mesa uses default keyboard handling as implemented by Base 2007 SDK version of the Source engine so it might rather be bug in the engine and not something that had been introduced by  Black Mesa.</p>
