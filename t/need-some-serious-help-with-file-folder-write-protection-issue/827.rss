    <title>Need some serious help with file/folder write protection issue!!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-some-serious-help-with-file-folder-write-protection-issue/827</link>
    <description>A brief recap. Yesterday I decided to start organising my files, especially my Steam files as they were all over my D :\Data\Games folder with no actual Steam folder. So I make a new Steam folder and a Non-Steam Games folder and put them all in. And thats where the trouble starts. As soon as I move them in, EVERY file and folder except for 1 (.rdata (RData file, 304kB ) from the Steam stuff) is suddenly write protected. This stops me from doing ANYTHING with them. When I try to open Steam as its .exe file, it tells me that:

&quot;[i]Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.[/i]&quot;

And when I try to access my user folder:

&quot;[i]D :\Data\Games\Steam (FYI its the new folder)\steamapps\chaemoir is not accessible. Access is denied.[/i]&quot;

[b]I have never encountered this problem before[/b], and it applies to almost all of my Steam files/folders, enough to stop me from being able to use or open ANY moved file/folder altogether.

Ive tried emailing the friends I have on Steam, none of which seem to know a thing about the problem. I would be VERY grateful for any help on the topic!!</description>

            <p>Maybe run the Steam.exe as an administrator?</p>

            <p>Wait, you’re telling me you tried to organize files that are used by a program?<br>
:facepalm:</p>
<p>Also, there are programs out there to delete and basically unlock those files, I don’t have any off the top of my head, but google it.</p>

            <p>I think your hard drive needs a format.</p>
<p>That usually means there is a filesystem error somewhere in that folder.</p>
<p>You should at least run the disk check tool (without windows running) with all options enabled.</p>
<p>Don’t expect miracles though, it usually deletes the corrupted files, or moves them somewhere never to be found.</p>
