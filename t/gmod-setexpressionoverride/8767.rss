    <description>I&#39;ve been trying out the console command &quot;ent_fire setexpressionoverride&quot; in Garry&#39;s Mod 13 recently and been having no luck.

I put the command in as follows: &quot;ent_fire z1* setexpressionoverride scenes/citadel/br_youneedme.vcd&quot; 
*My ent name after renaming it with &quot;ent_setname&quot;

I continuously get an error telling me that the scene cannot be found. Even when I change the scene to something different I get the same error for every scene.

I tried extracting the scene files from HL2&#39;s cache file and placing it in locations that matched up with where it was in the cache. I put the file in HL2&#39;s files and Gmod beta&#39;s. 

Is there something I&#39;m doing wrong or is there soemthing wrong with the game/files?</description>

            <p>New source is stupid about VCDs because Xbox is stupid about small text files. Any VCD files moved into a new game directory must then be compiled as part of its “scenes.image” file. To do this, open up Source SDK for the game in question, then go to File &gt; Rebuild Scenes.image. You may be able to move this file between some Source games.</p>

            <p>I personally don’t believe anyone on this forum even knows what your talking about. That being said you might want to make a post <a href="https://facepunch.com/forum.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. They usually know what to do.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
