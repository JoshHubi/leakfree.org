    <title>[Suggestion] AI alertness</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestion-ai-alertness/10219</link>
    <description>Hey there, having a very good time so far, overall a splendid re-imagining. 

I&#39;ve only really got one nitpick/gripe, but it has been a consistent problem throughout the game. The AI is far too alert and robotic in it&#39;s reactions. For aliens this isn&#39;t really an issue, but as it is soldiers target and fire upon you seemingly the instant you pop from cover, even if you were behind them (Save for a couple of scripted encounters). Thusly forcing the layer to take damage in most circumstances, and turning battles into one of attrition rather than ability. 

I would suggest, if at all possible giving the soldiers some degree of fallibility in their reactions, a half second delay after the player breaks cover, and have them only being able to &#39;detect&#39; the player if he is in front of them. To make them more human, less robotic, and in my humble opinion more fun to outwit rather than outgun/health/armor.</description>
