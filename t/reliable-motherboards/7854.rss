    <title>Reliable motherboards?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/reliable-motherboards/7854</link>
    <description>I recently got an msi 870a-g54 to go with an AMD 870 Phenom II Quad-Core to replace my Intel 1.8 Ghz dual core and I&#39;ve tried everything that anybody could possibly suggest (getting new memory, putting the board and components on cardboard, buying a speaker, etc. etc. etc.).

I&#39;m going to RMA the piece of shit, so I&#39;m in need of an ATX motherboard that has an AM3 or AM3+ socket and supports 1333 Mhz memory, has at least 2   pci-e slots, and is preferably within a $50- $200 price range. 

Thanks in advance to anyone who helps me with this. I&#39;d really to buy Human Revolution and play it on a decent processor.

EDIT: To clarify, my motherboard isn&#39;t posting (aka doing anything to get the BIOS and Windows 7 up and running), and by reliable I mean a motherboard that actually does this with the features mentioned above.</description>

<p>My corsair kit passed every test, the ram was not faulty, yet it caused BSOD with a motherboard just because they weren´t in their QVL list V_V</p>

            <p>DDR3 is a huge fiasco with compatibility with every board with every broand unfortunately, check your motherboards´s QVL and it will tell you what ram modules are compatible at what settings.</p>
<p>…hell I´ve got an 4gb OCZ gold kit and 8Gg Corsair kit both ddr3 1600 that i cant sell because no mobo seems to have them on their QVL ¬¬</p>

            <p>I currently have a Gigabyte ma77ot-ud3 mobo, running the AMD phenom II x4 955 edition, the only problem is I think there’s a slight in-compatibility with my RAM, It doesn’t like the default voltage needed and will not change in the BIOS. consequently resulting in occasional freeze-ups/ blue screen. I could be wrong about the cause. But the mobo does actually support ddr3 memory at 1600MHz.</p>

            <p>Well asus are really supportive for amd I think. When it comes to unlocking cores on some of the AMD processors, lots of websites suggest older firmwares. But with asus boards, you’re encougraged to flash to the latest version, their bios has built in core unlocking features and all.</p>
<p>I’m running my chip unlocked and overclocked, and my next board will be an Asus based purely on that.</p>

<p>evga… sure if you want to spend a fortune and spend hours configuring it for it to be perfect… oh gawd tghe 790i ultra sli has taken away so much time from my life it´s stupid V_V</p>
<p>Also… the evga 9800GX2 was never meant to be ran on air, but spending 200usd extra for a water cooler version of a 500usd card seemed stupid back then lol.</p>

            <p>As noted above - any hardware can throw you for a loop but in general, Asus and MSI are great boards (I’ve used one or the other for my last ~5 builds).</p>
<p>And I can’t validate at the moment but my i7 930 is humming happily at 3.98 or so, Hyper 212+ and usually maxes in the 50C’s after hours of burn-in.</p>

            <p>ASRock. Very solid performance and very competitive price, easily my favorite motherboard manufacturer out there right now. And yes they have both high and low end motherboards, as well as everything in between.</p>
<p>Keep in mind though MSI is a good company too, and all hardware has a risk of not working. I would exchange it and keep the new one they send you, it’s just easier that way.</p>

<p>if its ddr2, really any AM3+ asus mobo is going to be well prices and reliable.</p>
<p>If its ddr3, all motherboards of all brands are picky with their memory, best thing would be to check their respective “QVL” lists to see what modules are compatible</p>

            <p>I recently got an msi 870a-g54 to go with an AMD 870 Phenom II Quad-Core to replace my Intel 1.8 Ghz dual core and I’ve tried everything that anybody could possibly suggest (getting new memory, putting the board and components on cardboard, buying a speaker, etc. etc. etc.).</p>
<p>I’m going to RMA the piece of shit, so I’m in need of an ATX motherboard that has an AM3 or AM3+ socket and supports 1333 Mhz memory, has at least 2   pci-e slots, and is preferably within a $50- $200 price range.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who helps me with this. I’d really to buy Human Revolution and play it on a decent processor.</p>
<p>EDIT: To clarify, my motherboard isn’t posting (aka doing anything to get the BIOS and Windows 7 up and running), and by reliable I mean a motherboard that actually does this with the features mentioned above.</p>
