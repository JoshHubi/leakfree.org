    <title>steam locks up</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-locks-up/5465</link>
    <description>Since today my steam just locks up, right after the start wehn it wants to load the store page.
I already tried to delete anything of steam except steam.exe itself and steamapps.
I remember that I already had this issue, but can&#39;t remember the reason.
So, what else could I do to get it working again?</description>

            <p>ok, platform.gcf wasn’t the problem, it seems like the “dystopia live content.gcf” caused the lock ups</p>

            <p>Start renaming or moving the files and folders inside the steamapps folder until you find the culprit.</p>

            <p>Well if you already eradicated yourself of all the blobs you can try a reinstall. Move your steam apps folder out, uninstall steam, reinstall and move the steam apps folder back.</p>
