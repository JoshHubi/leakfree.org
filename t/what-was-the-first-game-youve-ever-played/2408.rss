            <p>Umm… PuttPutt travels through time? Maybe. I don’t know. probably some educational game. I just remember puttputt (it was a windows game I think) crashing my mom’s old PPC mac that she got from her boss.</p>
<p>EDIT: actually it might have been Oregon Trail at my friend’s house in preschool. I really don’t know.</p>

<p>The game that kind of got me into FPSes was Wolfenstein 3D.  I couldn’t stop playing that.  I didn’t play much in the way of other FPSes until Quake came out, which I sat down and beat with the only breaks for the bathroom.  Then Quake 2.  Quake 3 kinda sucked for me because I didn’t like the multiplayer aspect (I’m a single-player kind of guy).   Then I heard about this “sciency” game called “Half Life” that had aliens, so I got that.  :jizz:</p>
<p>And the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

            <p>Wow, looking at a bunch of these posts there are quite a few young 'uns here  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Hmmm, probably Pitfall for Atari. For PC… well, the ones I remember are Duke Nukem (the platformer, not 3D) and Commander Keen and such. But I probably played some non-memorable ones before that.</p>
<p>The one that really got me into PC gaming was Quake though. I mean, DooM did as well (and Heretic and Hexen and such), but technically Quake was what took me over the edge. I’ve never come back…</p>

            <p>Spyro the Dragon! Good ol’ Playstation. It got crap after Insominiac sold it off to EA or something. Sometimes I wish that they would remake it for the PS3 in shiny shiny graphics. Got round to re-playing it though on the PSP (custom firmware ftw).</p>
