    <description>So my g35 headset snapped when i tried to take it off today and now I am in need of a new headset. I thought I would ask what you guys would recommend?
I know there is some other similar threads but they were a few years old and much happens in that time.

I would prefer analog(3.5) but USB can work, I have no set budget but cheap is always welcome as long as quality doesn&#39;t suffer.</description>

            <p>Funny I was just about to create a new thread for this same reason. I’ve been shopping for the last three days for a new headset and I was looking at the Logitech but with the reports about the mic snapping It kinda pushed me away from that. With some further research I’m now looking at the Plantronics GameCom 780. Any one have any input on that model/brand?</p>

<p>I’ve been interested in the tiamat. Do you know if they are compatible with thx trustudio? And It says on the page that you need a soundcard installed, but do you think I can use my onboard card, it has all the ports.<br>
(this board: <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/P67%20Extreme4%20Gen3/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/P67%20Extreme4%20Gen3/</a>)</p>
<p>And YES audio quality really does matter to me. But I’m not sure i can afford a good sound card as well as that headset atm.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>i had the same worry mate, but i just sank the money into sound card aswell, your going to loose to much quality if you dont have a decent sound card. i went with one of these<br>
<a href="https://www.centrecom.com.au/catalog/forte-auzentech-forte-soundcard-p-36409.html?sort=2a" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.centrecom.com.au/catalog/forte-auzentech-forte-soundcard-p-36409.html?sort=2a</a><br>
and its treated me perfectly, low profile, great audio and a nice mid range price over here.<br>
if you dont get the audio card dont get the Tiamats stick with teh Megladons, USB connect cant go wrong.</p>

            <p>If you’re lucky Logitech will replace them even if they’re out of warranty. My friend had a G25 for just over 4 years, when it died, he spoke to Logitech and despite being really, really far out of warranty they gave him a 25% off on their store as thanks for being a valued customer. In my experience logitech have really nice customer support, lets hope you see the same treatment.</p>

            <p>Just stop fighting. As far as I see it it is the exact same construction in the g930 as in the g35. So that joint is the same and even though i was careful with mine i managed to break them so I\m afraid that the same would happen too them.</p>
<p>I’m currently trying too get my g35 replaced through warranty and if that works out i might not need to get a new set. Have too wait and see I guess.</p>

            <p>I’m arguing because he asked for a new headset, and you bscly recommended what he already has. The 930’s are much closer to the 35’s than you’r willing to admit that’s all.

            <p>Uhg, why are you trying to argue about this? You act as if I said it had better sound quality.  G930 is just built better, wireless is awesome, and the Gkeys work. I really don’t care if you disagree. OP asked for headset suggestions I recommend one I use. Simple as that.</p>

            <p>I’ve not broken the joints, not everyone does, so don’t try and pedal that as a ‘feature’ of the 930’s  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  As for the Gkeys, I can’t help you bro.</p>
<p>I have heard about this joints issue, so here’s a common sense solution for all you people out there; retract the cups when you’re not using them. Then the bottom edges don’t press against each other causing pressure, and therefore there won’t be as much stress on the joints. It’s the simplest thing, and infact, something I’ve always done with my headphones.</p>

</aside>
<p>Like I said, wireless is the only real feature enhancement.</p>
<p>My programmable keys work perfectly fine, was that an issue you had, because I’ve not noticed any issue. Sturdy, I can’t comment on, not having owned 930’s, let alone for a long enough period to judge. All I can say is my 35’s haven’t broken because I treat them right. They look identical construction wise, so I can’t see them being worlds apart. Comfy…well the 930’s have a slightly slimmer lighter headband, so maybe.</p>

<p>On my regular store OverclockersUK it’s £90 vs £130. Which is only 30%, but that’s still a pretty significant amount for, like I said, basically wireless.</p>

<p>I would like that too, from the webpage they seem to have the exact same features as my g35s with the only difference being that they are wireless and cost 50% more.</p>

<p>As much as I love the 201’s(mate has a pair I use a lot), they’re not really a headset. They don’t have a microphone.</p>

</aside>
<p>Very good point mate. Surely there must be an equivalent though? I´m just amazed at how brilliant and clear the sound is from them and yet they are like what, 25€? stupidly cheap, and yet to me they sound much better that a lot of much more expensive ones.</p>

<p>Well there are a few decent sound cards out there. If analogue is a must for you and you’re on a budget then maybe the <a href="https://www.corsair.com/en/vengeance-gaming/vengeance-gaming-headsets/vengeance-1300-analog-gaming-headset.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Corsair Vengeance 1300</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.asus.com/Multimedia/Audio_Cards/Xonar_DGX/#specifications" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Asus Xonar DGX</a> would suit you. Which you should be able to get all tolled for about $140.</p>
<p>What I currently have is a <a href="https://store.razerzone.com/store/razerusa/en_US/pd/productID.169420200/categoryId.35096300" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Razer Megaladon 7.1 USB headset</a>.<br>
I freakin love these puppies (laptop user). Uber comfortable for long sessions, and I wear glasses too. I only really feel a little discomfort from the glasses after about 5 hours. Five minute break and it’s good to go again.<br>
Game sound is fantastic (I don’t use the 7.1 emulation much as I’ve found cuts a lot of the body of the sound out - though it does work well), midrange is probably the warmest most clearly punctuated area of it’s soundscape. And the volume scales well - these headphones go really LOUD, but still preserve a ton of detail.<br>
Bass is imho purrrfect for music with the standard fabric ear cushions (I have the bass level set to maximum) and I wouldn’t even consider getting the leather replacements.</p>
<p>I listen to the DJ Channel on TRANS-FM most of the time. Sometimes the delivery of more subtle ques in the tracks sounds so real that I actually go “Wtf was that!?” pull off the headphones, look at the door to my room and continue, “oh yeah, it’s the headset.”</p>

<p>I’ve been interested in the tiamat. Do you know if they are compatible with thx trustudio? And It says on the page that you need a soundcard installed, but do you think I can use my onboard card, it has all the ports.<br>
(this board: <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/P67%20Extreme4%20Gen3/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/P67%20Extreme4%20Gen3/</a>)</p>
<p>And YES audio quality really does matter to me. But I’m not sure i can afford a good sound card as well as that headset atm.</p>
