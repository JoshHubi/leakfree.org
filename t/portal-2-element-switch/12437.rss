    <title>[Portal 2] Element / Switch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portal-2-element-switch/12437</link>
    <description>So once upon a time I was a Portal 2 mapper. It&#39;s how I got started out~

Today I&#39;d like to share just a little bit of that history. I&#39;ve released around three maps. The two latter ones are actually up to some sort of standard. The former, which was my very first map, is not, and thus I&#39;m not including it in this post (unless enough people want to play it).

Both of these maps are a bit old, so much so that I don&#39;t even have the original vmf files anymore. Please keep both these tidbits in mind.

[u]Switch[/u]
The last Portal 2 map, this dates back to around late July of 2012. This map was build sometime after the release of the Perpetual Testing Initiative. As such, this map is completely compatible with it. Simple download and play here.

[u]Element[/u]
This dates back to August of 2011. I had originally designed this to be the first part of a map pack (which didn&#39;t get really far). This one is not compatible with PTI so it has to be installed and played the old fashioned way. You&#39;ll find a readme in the zip folder.

Note that there is an extremely obvious bug at the very beginning where you are already holding a portal gun. I cannot fix this at this time.

            <p>Portal 2 doesn’t seem to look through the “addons” folder for some reason. You might to make it so that it would have to merge with the “maps” and “materials” folder in the “portal2” folder.</p>

            <p>I played through your element map for Portal 2. I thought you did a great job on it, but you might want to take the addons part of the readme out. Here’s why:</p>
<p>The file didn’t create an addons folder when I extracted it to the portal2 folder as instructed. I renamed the folder from “New folder (4)” to “addons” after extracting it and attempted to play it. When I tried to get in that map via developer console, it couldn’t find it at all. I had to copy and paste the “maps” and “materials” folder from the addons folder just to get it to work properly.</p>
