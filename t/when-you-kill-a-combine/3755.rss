    <title>When you kill a combine</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/when-you-kill-a-combine/3755</link>
    <description>When you kill a combine cop in HL2, there is a female voice message (some sort of warning). Does anyone know what does it say? I cant make it out since its not very clear. Just curious, thx.

Edit: And also, what is the announcement at the start of route canal saying? (&quot;attention protection scheme.......&quot; &quot;attention please, an identified person&quot; etc... something about civil protection scheme?)</description>

            <p>Humanoid Combine<br>
The primary military force of the Combine on Earth is the humanoid Combine Overwatch (referred to by Doctor Breen as the “Transhuman arm of the Combine Overwatch”, although he could be referring to the entire Combine military presence on earth as the Overwatch and the ranks including modified humans are the transhuman arm.): humans who have been modified into “transhuman” (or “post-human”, as referred to by Dr. Kleiner) cyborgs. They are the most frequently encountered foes throughout Half-Life 2. This could also be another possible reason why they are called the Combine, because they are a “combination” of humans and alien technology. It is important to note that the Civil Protection foes are not hybrids and are in fact, human.</p>
<p>Civil Protection: The quasi-thoughtpolice that patrols the cities, monitor the public airways, and conduct randomized raids. Since little modification is involved, some Resistance members, such as Barney Calhoun, join Civil Protection in order to go under cover to investigate Combine activity and tip off would-be victims.<br>
Overwatch Soldier: The main military of the Combine on Earth. Soldiers patrol and enforce Combine law outside of the city boundaries. It includes the Shotgun Soldier and the Nova Prospekt Prison Guard.<br>
Overwatch Elite: The Elite soldiers of the Combine Overwatch. They’ve undergone extensive modifications and are seen protecting the Citadel or occasionally leading squads of regular soldiers.<br>
Stalker: Mutilated, drone-like slaves that are created from dissident Citizens and captured Rebels.</p>
<p>Guys, that mean that I know ^^</p>

            <p>Personally, I feel the Overwatch is more likely to be a heavily modified human rather than a computer. Her voice seems too natural, especially when you compare it to things like GlaDOS. But who knows?</p>

<p>Yeah but they are two distinct things, he was just trying to show that. Both can be called Overwatch for short.</p>

            <p>The way Combine assimilation works is by reward scheme. People join Civil Protection for better living conditions and power. CP Officers are encouraged to do well by further rewards including “organic reproduction simulation” as said by the Overwatch Dispatch, indicating they get free sex for doing a good job.</p>
<p>However, in order to move up the food chain you have to give away more of your humanity. By agreeing to become part of the Overwatch military you go through the surgical processes and become more of a slave. Overwatch soldiers aren’t rewarded so much as threatened to do their tasks. The Dispatch constantly mentions “permanent off-world assignment” in Nova Prospekt.</p>
<p>Presumeably the Elite Corps seen towards the end of the game have had further modifications to their bodies and may be little more than robots.</p>

            <p>Where exactly does this information about CPs being human come from? I always assumed ALL Combine were modified in some way or another. Didn’t Isacc say that all those who became a part of the military machine were purged of their humanity?<br>
The only contradiction of this that I’ve seen is the Civil Protection series by Ross Scott, and that’s a parody.</p>

<p>I never really thought too heavily into it. You never see any metro cop besides barney take off their mask, and the only time you see any combine without their mask is the one with the white guy in Nova Prospekt.<br>
On top of that I had trouble identifying metrocops from the actual soldiers period, since I usually shot and moved on before actually stopping to get a look at the differences between the costuming. Soldiers were just the ones with the bigger guns as far as I was concerned.</p>

<p>You know, I had wondered about that for a while. I thought everyone who joined the combine had to undergo the transhuman organ removal/replacement procedure. It left me wondering why Barney hadn’t gotten found out for not having undergone that procedure. This makes so much more sense now. It’s also going to make it a lot easier to play Human Error now.</p>
