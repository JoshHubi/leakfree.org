    <description>I figured I&#39;d revive JeanPaul&#39;s late thread, it had sparked some rather interesting ideas/ drawings and I&#39;d hate to see that all lost. Specifically it was in reguards to the rotating platforms and how to go about their design. 

For those of you that missed it JeanPaul was referring to this section- (see attachment)

To get the ball rolling I&#39;ll add my two cents, it always struck me odd how the random teleport sphere just hung in the air above some of the rotors. Perhaps having a bit of arcing between the central pillar to the tellys to show some sort of connection? 

My first &quot;official&quot; post to the bm forms&#39; (waves) Ello&#39; all glad to be part of the discussion.

ALright. Inn my mind they’re pretty similar but thats okay.</p>
<p>Ill officially leave this thread alone, I bet its not useful anyway since hes probably already modeled the room anyway.</p>

            <p>Hey Assassin dude, you must realize that the Test chamber device is not modeled in any way after real world scientific equipment, it’s merely something a concept artist drew on paper, same with the textures, they have no purpose other than looking cool and scientificky.</p>
<p>And just because a level designer chose the same textures for two different models does not mean they are the same. I sometimes use a texture of a random red metallic object and use it on a fusebox or a power coupling, does not mean any of them are related.</p>

</aside>
<p>Alright Xilef, youve vented. Now breathe deeply…<br>
The point of this thread is to come up with a rational explanation for these platforms, a reason for why they are there.<br>
On the topic of this being a mod, of course its a mod, trying to make everything that made the game great in 1998 even better for todays players. One of those things was scientific plausability. And in this case we are trying to make this weird platform scientifically plausable, rather than just there for kicks.</p>
<p>With all this said, I was reading some chemistry texts and one explained a mass spectrometer. Yes, this should sound familiar because the infamous test chamber focuses on an anti-mass spectrometer.</p>
<p>Heres some shots of a mass spectrometer.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
Okay, notice that the test chamber models around this device. The xen sample is what that sample is. We have our electron beam (‘power to phase 1 and 2 emittors’) The mentioned ‘im seeing predictable phase arrays’ are what the detector records, thereby measuring the levels of antimatter. It is obvious that Valve did their homework before modeling.<br>

<p>Any shape look startingly familiar?<br>
So in the test chamber the things on the floor must be electromagnets, which is kinda what everyone had said.</p>

<p>BTW I was pretty dumb to say they couldnt be magnets because they have pipes coming out of them sorry. Forgive me, that was dumb. Of course they would have pipes, obviously they arent affecting the room or youd be stuck to them. anyway.</p>
<p>Established earlier in another post, these things on the floor are the same in LC. Most likely they have a different use then in mass spectrometry, but at least they are, for sure and definetely, electromagnets.</p>
<p>As a side note, Xilef if you dont appreciate this post, well im sorry. This thread was created with discussions like these in mind, and no one is making you post here. See ya round the forums!</p>

<p>Supercunductor magnets, such as the ones used on some MRI’s, the pipes could be used to provide the liquid nitrogen used to keep the temperatures cool enough.</p>
<p>They don’t have to be magnets, but don’t dismiss an idea just because you can’t think of a reason, after all its a <span class="bbcode-b">game</span> that involves a research facility that has developed technology we don’t understand.</p>

<p>Looks to me like these things have grates on them and vents because they get hot. My new favorite theory is now that they are generators. But stil, why are they spinning in LC?</p>

            <p>^ You’re not the only one who never saw it. There are people who have played Half-Life 20 times and never seen it. I’m hoping the developers do just what you’ve suggested and put some pieces of paper on a table or have a diagram that shows the destinations of all the portals, or at least the ones you need to take.</p>
<p>The thing is that I went into that room several time before, exploring and hoping for just a clue. I must have looked at the three numbers several times but didn’t understand them. From the wrong angle or even from the <span class="bbcode-i">right</span> angle, they simply look like another generic blood sprite.</p>

            <p>I… never saw that 247 :o</p>
<p>Why would it be written in blood stains? These teleporters seemed like they were working before the resonance cascade anyway. Why not just have a bunch of notes on a table with 2-4-7</p>
<p>Also… When I replayed that part few days ago, I wanted to visit every place anyway. There are some nice ammo caches in there  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I think the 247 thing should be made more obvious.</p>
<p>I’ve just replayed through that part, and I’m pretty sure I only found it because I was looking (I’ve never seen it before).</p>
<p>To anyone who hadn’t played it it would just look like any other bloodstain I think.</p>

            <p>About Lambda Core:<br>
I just played up to it and it’s been a while since I played HL. I couldn’t SEE the exit door at the very end of the puzzle, after jumping across radiation over spinning platforms to go through the 1/2 puzzle, I didn’t realise it took me even higher and i would look around, i thought it was familiar and jumped back into the teleporter to try and get it right. It was only watching a youtube video when i realised there was a door at the top.<br>
EDIT: Also, i think the platforms should be maintenance/inspection platforms. They could have a rail around them and closed maintenance hatches around the walls at the heigh of the platforms. Maybe there could be robot welding arms around. The place could be malfunctioning so they are spinning out of control, with sparks and bolts of electicity emitting from them.<br>
What I hated most was missing the platform as you couldn’t see the exit without testing first.<br>
Also, where is the “247” blood writing??? Cant find it at all!</p>
