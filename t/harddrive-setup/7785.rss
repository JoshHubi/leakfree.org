    <title>Harddrive Setup</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/harddrive-setup/7785</link>
    <description>So I have a 1TB HDD in my computer and have yet to backup anything (:fffuuu :slight_smile: . I was wondering what a good HDD setup would be. I&#39;ve heard of multiple things such as different types of RAID, just having Windows backup to a separate HDD, putting the OS on a SSD then everything else on a HDD. 

What would you guys recommend?

Edit: Meant to post this in Help but oh well.</description>

            <p>Might have missed something but you need at the very least 2 hard drives of the same size to make raid (in a backup configuration)</p>

            <p>RAID is okay, but it’s usually a full-time solution (i.e. if you run your computer on a RAID, the drives are running as long as your PC does, so they get a lot of running hours).  To be TRULY backed up, you need at least 2 copies of any given file (the source and the backup) and preferably a backup that is off-site (to eliminate fire/flood/theft/etc).</p>
<p>That said, a realistic/economic backup would involve at least one external hard drive that you only turn on when you’re running a backup and turn off immediately after.  Once you have that external, the process by which you backup is entirely up to you -</p>
<ol>
<li>Just do a straight copy/paste from your internal drive to the external (simple but takes a long time, and can’t do a true system recovery since you’d be missing the MBR).</li>
<li>Use Windows backup and tell it to backup to the external</li>
<li>Get yourself some imaging software, such as Macrium Reflect (free), Acronis True Image Home, etc, which will allow you to do incremental backups and such.</li>
</ol>
