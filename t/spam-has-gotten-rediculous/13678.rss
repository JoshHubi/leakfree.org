    <title>SPAM has gotten rediculous</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/spam-has-gotten-rediculous/13678</link>
    <description>There has been A LOT of spam lately. Specifically with the advent of the new website. 

I propose that ALL newly registered accounts be limited to ONE post for a period of 36 hours and to only make newly registered accounts aware of that rule AFTER they have submitted their first post. (Obviously, moderators should be allowed to bypass that restriction once it&#39;s verified that it&#39;s legitimate.}  This way, if it&#39;s spam, there will only be one occurrence of the garbage prior to them being banned.  Hopefully, when the ban is put into place it&#39;s not only for the user name but also includes IP addresses. 

Thoughts?</description>

            <p>Thank you for the concern.  The moderators and administrators are very well aware of this issue and are working hard to make this forum spam free.</p>
<p>Closing this thread now.</p>

            <p>It didn’t. The swarm of new spam bots just happened to come in at roughly the same time as the forum switch. We were having some spam issues right at the end of the old forum’s lifespan too.</p>

            <p>We’re aware of the spam, we’re doing everything we can to fix it. You see it, but imagine the work we have to do to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Hubi’s working with the board software designers to come up with a solution to stop them, and in the meantime the moderators and developers are working overtime to keep the boards clear. I had to manually delete 600 spam threads this morning. We’re doing our best. Literally every day I’ve been logging onto the forums every 20 minutes and clearing out the spam. While I’m<span class="bbcode-b"> at work at my real job</span>. And it’s not enough.</p>

<p>Yep, you’re right. That was my fault. Restored them - thanks for the info. We had a particularly nasty attack yesterday, I deleted over 500 threads, so probably selected a whole page without noticing.</p>

            <p>Hubicorn will get to it eventually. It takes time to discern a particular sites most efficient method of bot blocking.</p>
<p>There are good ways of blocking bots, which do not adversely affect a new users ability to join in the conversations, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rejecting posts within the first few days which contain an image tag, or a URL. (Our implementation works via post count instead, and posting links or images cannot be done until a user has 10 posts and has been registered for a few days. Additionally, we have a game linked to our forum accounts, and links cannot be posted until a user has a positive score in the game.)<br>
– This inherently prevents real people from dropping in simply to advertise their personal products or projects.</li>
<li>There are new and effective anti-bot methods at registration which can be enabled, whether WoltLab has any built in is another question.</li>
</ul>

            <p>I’ve noticed that all of the spam contains the same number in the heading, could the moderators be given the ability to set that as an automatic deletion key phrase?</p>

            <p>I think an short authorization period (or first few posts) would help control the spam, but that would also put a heavier workload on the mods.</p>

<p>My second suggestion is to remove those deleted posts from the forum instead of turning them white for a while, since they clutter multiple pages while they’re still visible.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If I’m not mistaken, a mod said this is thanks to there being a “trash” as well as “delete” option, the latter of which is apparently not being used entirely. Pretty sure we aren’t supposed to see that by design.</p>
