Remastered versions of the original games all polished and shinied up for the highest definitions of sound and visuals along with the original versions of the games patched to be compatible with modern computers.

Seems like Gearbox is not fucking this up this time around.</description>

            <p>My thoughts exactly. Homeworld is one of my favorite RTS games and I was really hoping we would get Homeworld 1 with all the features in tact instead of a watered-down HW2 mod gameplay wise. Otherwise though it does seem very lovingly handled.</p>
<p>Maybe gearbox will listen, i mean why put in all those formations if they don’t even work properly (some of them actually glitch out a lot of the time)</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The game is so much more gorgeous than I thought it would be - and I already thought it was going to be gorgeous. The graphics are stellar and the Homeworld 1 ships look completely glorious. It’s clear a huge amount of love has been put into the visuals and the presentation.</p>
<p>I wish some of that effort had been diverted into the gameplay design. There’s a lot of gameplay detail from HW1 which has just been dropped or doesn’t work properly - the MP at the moment I would say is very mediocre with regards to the HW1 races, it’s not really even close to how HW1 played. The fact that formations basically might as well not even exist is a major bummer and makes larger scale strike craft battles IMPOSSIBLE to read and very confusing. Resource, construction speeds and research speeds work like HW2, so when playing the HW1 races you basically can just spam crazy amounts of units of any type. All the multiplayer games where I’ve played the HW1 races I pretty much just spam Frigates to great effect. Again, they play totally like HW2 Frigates in that they’re glass cannons and are extremely expendable.</p>
<p>I was so excited for the combined multiplayer idea but I don’t think it’s very good. It is a beta though, and balancing the 4 races with one another was always going to be extremely challenging. It will undoubtedly improve.</p>
<p>Personally I really wanted something with HW:R’s graphical fidelity which played very close to HW1, because I think most people would agree its MP design was far superior to HW2, and was much deeper and had far more strategy than HW2’s rock paper scissors unit spam. Unfortunately it really is a HW2ified version of HW1. However - Gearbox/what’s left of the original Homeworld team clearly loved the game greatly and may be far more limited by the engine and timing than we realise (trust me, the BMS team know greatly the challenges of dealing with a restrictive engine). I’m hopeful they can bring back more of Homeworld 1’s gameplay details and design, over time, particularly if we’re vocal about it. At the very least, the formations HAVE to work properly!</p>
<p>At any rate, I’m just delighted that people love and care about this series and that it might have a future. It’s still fantastic and I am really happy with it despite my complaints.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately Formations are fucked and serve no purpose other than grouping. A lot of the time ships won’t even regroup into formation after they finish combat.</p>
<p>Which confuses me because they included all the original formations - and they all had combat/defensive uses in homeworld 1, so I assumed they would here as well but it doesn’t seem to be the case</p>
<p>Game is gorgeous though</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Apparently homeworld 2 is the base for Homeworld 1, and as such it doesn’t have the same little details engine-side that the first game had.</p>
<p>Stuff like fighter shots being actual projectiles that can be intercepted, or fighters holding formation in combat with different formations being effective for different situations, nor do tactics function the same way and fighter’s AI flight paths aren’t really dependent on the enemy positioning and shit like that.</p>
<p>I mean it still looks awesome no doubt, but those little things added so much to the game and they dropped that stuff in homeworld 2, i was really hoping they would’ve translated them in some way to the remaster.</p>

<p>Is this the kind of RTS where you can pause the game to issue orders? I always go crazy in games where you have to work as fast as possible to manage all your units.</p>

            <p>As long as they don’t change the voice acting and music this seems like a definite buy for me</p>
<p>I absolutely love homeworld’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>They should add in the ship death screams from homeworld cataclysm though. That was really good feedback, and made loosing your forces actually kinda scary.</p>

            <p>This is very exciting. I consider the original Homeworld to be among one of the greatest games of all time, and I’ve always absolutely loved the Homeworld series.</p>
<p>If they do a good job of this (which shouldn’t be too difficult - just some hi res models, effects, and backgrounds should do the trick - Homeworld was always a very visually minimalistic game), I will be a very happy little boy.</p>
