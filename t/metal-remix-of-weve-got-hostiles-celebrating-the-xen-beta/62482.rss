    <title>Metal remix of &quot;We&#39;ve Got Hostiles&quot; - celebrating the Xen beta!</title>

    <description>Hi, I&#39;m Björn, I&#39;m a musician and audio engineer. Among other things I produce metal remixes of video game music on my YouTube channel. I love the Half-Life series and have remixed a couple of tracks from the HL2 OST already. When the devs here recently announced the Xen beta, I was super excited and wanted to celebrate the event with a remix from the Black Mesa OST, which I hadn&#39;t touched so far. When I planned out the remix, I unfortunately wasn&#39;t aware how imminent the release of the Xen soundtrack was, so I picked &quot;We&#39;ve Got Hostiles&quot; from the 2012 OST.

Forward a couple of weeks to today, where I&#39;ve release &quot;COTERMINOUS&quot; on YouTube and SoundCloud. Check it out, if you like, and let me know what you think!

Also, the Xen soundtrack is so friggin&#39; good. Joel outdid himself. Would it be low-hanging fruit to remix Shadows of Death as well? Because it&#39;s already pretty ... metal already, if you know what I mean?

Cheers!
