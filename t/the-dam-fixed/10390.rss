    <title>The Dam [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-dam-fixed/10390</link>
    <description>Strangely, one of the most impressive areas to look at in screenshots is one of the buggiest i&#39;ve come across in the game thus far, mapping wise.

Jump off the Dam, on the right side (where you don&#39;t die) on the approach across it. Oh look, giant chunks of wall missing! Is this just me, or is this the same for everyone?

(Upon closer inspection, it seems to be areas in which the water brush hasn&#39;t been pulled far enough across) [url]https://i.imgur.com/nnGoo.jpg[/url]


Also, random spike of terrain in the middle. No idea why that is there, but it has no collision detection so I&#39;ll assume its a misplaced model or something. [url]https://i.imgur.com/9iiN1.jpg[/url]


Finally - and before someone tells me, I know its a limit of the Source Engine to only have one height of expensive water at once - but does the Cheap Water have to be [i]that[/i] ugly?

[i][b]However, I gotta say that this is one of the most impressive things I&#39;ve ever played, and it utterly breaks my heart that you guys aren&#39;t seeing a dime from this - so I can but hope that it&#39;ll get you hired by Valve.[/b][/i]</description>
