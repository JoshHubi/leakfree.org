    <description>My friend was at one point, not too long ago, a real EVE Online nerd. I liked to play it alright myself, but he was so into it he would buy in-game money from a 3rd party site so he could afford the best stuff. Anyhow, he kinda got out of it, thought of playing again, and when he logged in, he found that, instead of banning him, or forcing him to sell items to pay back the illegal money, they simply reversed the contract, causing him to pay back the money from out of his game wallet. Money he didn&#39;t have, of course, leaving him with a massive negative balance. This might not seem like such a big deal unless you know that any transaction in EVE requires fees, just like in real life. Meaning not only could he not buy anything, he couldn&#39;t [b]sell[/b] anything either, and no one could even send him money to help him pay it off. It was a total ball-busting move - the only way he could earn money is from running tons and tons of missions for the relatively paltry rewards.

So anyway, I thought that was a pretty hilarious way to deal with that situation. What are some of your favorite anti-piracy or anti-cheating methods in games?</description>

            <p>If someone made a game that was as close to real life as possible, it would be hilarious if that game slowly evolved into amnesia as you kept playing if you pirated it.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to today, I agree with lambda about that those are pretty funny, but the best one has to be the Nitendo DS “Michael Jackson” game thing, even if it forces little girls to smash the console in any way possible. &gt; <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I think I had the Earthbound loads of enemies glitch a couple of years ago due to a badly ported ROM. The Batman: AA was quite a good piece of game design because you had enough play time to get you completely hooked, and then you get stuck with an unsolvable puzzle, making the pirates want to go out and buy the game.</p>
<p>However, the EVE Online money thing is just really smart.</p>
