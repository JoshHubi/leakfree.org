            <p>Try using mat_monitorgamma_tv_enabled 1. This  ups gamma. Oh and try using mat_dxlevel 95 for flashlight if it doesn’t work either. I think that certain specs of a computer effects the way brightness is handled. Happened to me. Just make sure to put those two codes every time you reload the game. But it worked for me. Edit: also it seemed awhile since you posted the comment, so I don’t know if I am being redundant here. If I am, sorry.</p>
