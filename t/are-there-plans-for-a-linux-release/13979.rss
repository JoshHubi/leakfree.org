    <title>Are there plans for a Linux release</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/are-there-plans-for-a-linux-release/13979</link>
    <description>Hello people of earth!  I was wondering if you guys are going to be releasing Black Mesa on Linux once Xen is done.  I&#39;ve played the original Half-life on Linux, and seeing as Valve is pushing Linux support it seems like it would fit.  Hopefully make it support just one distribution (like Debian) then list the dependencies in the system requirements.  I really liked HL1 and would love to play this, but seeing as I have no Windows machine I wont be buying/playing it for a while.</description>
