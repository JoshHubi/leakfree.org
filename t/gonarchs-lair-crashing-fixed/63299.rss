    <title>Gonarchs lair Crashing(Fixed)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gonarchs-lair-crashing-fixed/63299</link>
    <description>I have a great laptop it handles the whole game until a few days ago. I started up Gonarch&#39;s lair(the last fight). When Gonarch blew to pieces the game crashed. The next day I start up Gonarch&#39;s lair just before the chase that leads to the final battle place as soon as I started the fire the game crashed. It only happens in Gonarchs lair and it&#39;s not my computer it&#39;s weird Please help. -ImAGweenBean.</description>
