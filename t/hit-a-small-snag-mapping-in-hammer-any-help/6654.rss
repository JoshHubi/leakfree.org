    <title>Hit a small snag mapping in hammer, any help?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hit-a-small-snag-mapping-in-hammer-any-help/6654</link>
    <description>So I am quite the novice using hammer but I have been trying to improve my skills with a L4D map I have been working on recently, all is going swimmingly but with some static props the lighting and texture seem to be a little warped, any suggestions

PIC: here is the problem with a car model
![](upload://yOOxZSdPo31FQoMZGuQTxD3Wtva.png)

and the same for a curtain rail
![](upload://yOOxZSdPo31FQoMZGuQTxD3Wtva.png)

Another problem I have been getting is with models that have transparent textures the shadows seem to be cast off the collision model as opposed to the dominant texture. I have tried to fix this using the lights.rad method but the shadow is still being cast off the collision model despite being told not to. 

as shown here;![](upload://yOOxZSdPo31FQoMZGuQTxD3Wtva.png)

any help would be greatly appreciated

EDIT:
progress. or lack there of.

<p>This explains now to get the shadows casting from the polys, instead of the collision model pretty well <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jEuuvSevi0&amp;feature=player_embedded" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jEuuvSevi0&amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p>
<p>As for the texture thing, I have no idea. Have you tried using a prop_physics and ticking static in flags?</p>

<p>That was the exact tut I was using to try and solve it but as stated the lights.rad method didn’t exactly work. but cheers anyway.</p>
<p>Tried using cubemaps and that solved the texture problem so i’m content for now</p>
<p>EDIT &lt; Success</p>

Your light model doesn’t look like it’s using it’s “on” texture. Make sure it’s using the right skin, there should be a tab in the model browser in Hammer which will tell you which skin you need to be using.</p>
<p>That’s about it, for your issues.</p>

            <p>What i usually do is place an env_cubemap next to it, if that happens, but that’s probably not the proper way to solve this.</p>
