            <p>Guys, you obviously havn’t played the frankly fantastic, original title <span class="bbcode-i">Duke Nukem:Forever</span> yet, have you? Because once you get the oppertunity to listen to all the well thought out and modern jokes, Black mesa’s release date is shown after the ending credits!</p>
<p>But seriously, the release date should be pretty obvious, as they said a couple of times that the site would be massively updated, and there will probably be a lot of buzz about it on the 'net.</p>

            <p>It’s gonna be all over the news and make the late night monologues:</p>
<p>"One of the most anticipated game modifications of all times was finally released yesterday. But the fans of the mod were not satisfied with the final work of this Black Mesa develpoers team:</p>
<p>After downloading a 10 GB .rar file, when they tried to install the game, the only thing in the archive was a video: a 90 min HD documentary about the making of the music video of a song called “Friday”, by Rebecca Black. 23 years ago, this girl was pretty popular because of this single which went absolutly viral on the internet."</p>

<p>This has gone from irritating to mildly amusing to just plain boring now. Constantly trying to piss me off with the whole psychic thing is never going to work. You can all stop now. I would like a fresh start with this like the whole thread never happened. Of course with the way the rest of the forums are this seems to be a giant troll den, in which case you will all never let it go and I will just have to continue to ignore you. Either way, I win.</p>

            <p>Personally I don’t think they should announce it. If they announce it for all the world to hear, then the site will crash withing a matter of minutes. If they just release it without telling anyone, at least a handful of people will get a few percent of the download before the news gets out to the general population and the site gets crashed for a while anyway.</p>

            <p>I believe even vavle will set up a news from Steam when the mod is released just like they did when showing a little news about the mod.</p>
