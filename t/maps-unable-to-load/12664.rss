    <title>Maps unable to load?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/maps-unable-to-load/12664</link>
    <description>When I launch the game, I am taken to the main menu, with the background functioning perfectly. However, when I attempt to load a map, it begins to load for a millisecond, and then it quickly returns to the main menu. No crash, it simply refuses to load maps.

To try and fix this, I&#39;ve re-installed Black Mesa multiple times, (I have also re-downloaded it from both the torrent and two of the mirrors on the main website.) I&#39;ve reinstalled SDK Base 2007, to no avail, and there is nothing related to this on the Forums that I&#39;ve so far seen. Any help would be both enthusiastically accepted and graciously thanked.</description>

<p>Many, including me, had a problem with bm not loading. Right click on source sdk 2007. Click properties. Click BETAS. In the drop down select steampipe then select local files and verify integrity of tool cache. It should work. I did this and now black mesa works fine.</p>
