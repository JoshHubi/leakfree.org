    <title>Blast Pit lighting and AI bugs?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blast-pit-lighting-and-ai-bugs/14835</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve encountered a few strange bugs in blast pit, and I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s causing them. [spoiler][img]https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/260461914170253384/60CEC235A426B63E9C77182A9405B91583FAD3B6/[/img][/spoiler] And[spoiler][img]https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/260461914170252994/E87D7100E2C7D72E5BBCC57BB7EBAF3B7A6D7868/[/img][/spoiler]

I&#39;m thinking these might have something to do with a workshop addon I have, the Blast Pit lighting fix, but I&#39;m not entirely sure. The other one is even stranger to me, though. The Tentacles AI seems to have glitched out, and I don&#39;t know why. It happened after I returned to the rocket silo after turning on the huge fan.

As you can see, they all seem to be stuck in the bind/ref pose, and nothing I do gets them to move. Anybody have any ideas as to why this is happening?</description>

            <p>That did it. Not sure why it was affecting the AI, I’ll try to contact the creator of that addon. Thanks!</p>
