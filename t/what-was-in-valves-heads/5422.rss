<p>I think it’s funny how the Flood is basically Headcrabs.  More evolved or some bullshit, but still, headcrabs.</p>
<p>Also, in response to the thread title: delicious brains.</p>

<p>No, he’s Gordon’s son from the future. Gordon wasn’t a good dad so when he grew up he used science to turn himself into a time traveler and has proceeded to make Gordon’s life a living hell by causing the resonance cascade, and now he uses him as an inter-dimensional mercenary, hiring him out to who ever can pay the biggest price. In the instance of Half-Life 2, Eli’s life was the price.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how much the design has changed. It’s gone from a complete joke to totally serious. Looking at very early screenshots shows how over-the-top it was (scarred and disturbed looking ‘mad’ scientists, eyes-wide-with-terror military policemen, muscular cigar smoking soldiers with handheld miniguns, etc). And the early concept are gets even weirder, the original human enemies come to mind:</p>
<p>Special Unit / CIA Soldier aka “The Butcher”: A man in heavy metal armour with circular saws for hands.<br>
Special Weapons / CIA Assassin: A man in light metal armour with a sniper-machinegun and what appears to be a belt of throwing knives.<br>
Special Attack / Psionic Soldier aka “Brainboy”: A short man with a large head that is hooked up to a “thought cannon”.<br>
Light Attack: Female CIA Soldier: A tall thin woman with large breasts wearing a skimpy outfit and wielding a Machine-pistol. (And the only surviving concept, being recreated as the Female Assassin)</p>

            <p>Valve only wanted to create a quick and cheap game to pay their gambling bills and Gabe’s addiction to exotic hookers. Turns out they’re so talented that they still created a pure gem of a game even without trying too much.</p>
<p>Now you can imagine what would have come out if they had actually made more of an effort.</p>
