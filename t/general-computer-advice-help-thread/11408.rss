    <description>I thought it would be a good idea to make a thread where everybody could ask for questions related to their computer instead of having hundreds of thread asking for &quot;which mobo should I choose?&quot;.

So I&#39;ll start it with my question: [b]I&#39;ll probably reformat tomorrow, and I was wondering whether I should go with Windows 8 or 7 ?[/b] I&#39;ve hear people saying they hate Win8, but I&#39;ve never really gotten why. Thanks.</description>

            <p>Sure.<br>
(Might be useful to post my specs for reference:</p>
<p>AsusP5B-Plus mobo<br>
Intel Q9550 2.83GHz<br>
70GB HDD for Windows<br>
250GB HDD for Data<br>
ATi RadeonHD 5770 1GB<br>
3GB DDR2 Ram)</p>
<p>Right now I’m not experiencing any technical problems whatsoever, except one thing and I havn’t been able to find anybody else with the same problem. For some reasons custom folder paths seems to randomly vanish. Shortcuts or custom user data folders like My Music get deleted (just the shortcut or program setting, not the folder itself). I don’t know what could cause that, but I think it’s because Windows 8 is designed for tablets or pre-built computers, it’s not made to handle more than a single hard drive.</p>
<p>Actually it is a lot less “customizable” than previous iterations of Windows. It’s almost like they’ve gone with Apple’s mindset and decided to make it pretty and user-friendly, diminishing the user’s control. You’ve really got to look for the “My Computer” shortcut and the Control Panel, which is also quite hidden, has been dumbed down a lot. That’s good for tech-illiterate people who just want to check their mails and go on Facebook, and I’m not against that, but for the experienced user or just anybody who’s comfortable with Windows OSes, it’s quite mind boggling. You have to start up with a clear mind and get those habits of fiddeling in the Control Panel or using the task menu out of you, because it’s gone.</p>
<p>You can also tell it’s been designed for touch screen. Most UI functions like swipping to the edges of the screen or clicking the corners would feel very natural on a tablet but a tad awkward with a mouse. As for speed, it’s very good. Integrated, full-screen apps like Mail open very fast without hogging your resources.</p>
<p>So, so far I’m really liking it, and I’m sure (and I hope) Microsoft will listen to their customers when it gets properly released and make it more “experienced-user” friendly.</p>
<p>Here’s a couple of screenshots that I took.</p>
<p>That’s your new task menu, hope you like it.<br>

            <p>Edit: NVM need to read more. Good to know you’re enjoying it. If you don’t mind, could you report back in awhile with any problems you run into? Could be useful later to let people know.</p>

            <p>Well my hardware is starting to age quite a bit and I quite like the Metro UI (I’ve had both Zunes and I still have a Windows Phone) so I decided to go for Win8. So far I’m liking it very much. Feels very clean. And it is quite fast too. Havn’t tried any games yet, but overall use works quite well. And I still havn’t seen anything about Smartscreen. But thanks anyways !</p>

            <p>There are (or were in the RC I was using) various drivers for old XP and Vista related hardware that won’t work at all. The UI is kinda awkward, but that’s my opinion. It’s mainly just the drivers that don’t work, but I have no idea what hardware you’re using so I can’t really judge if you should use it or not. Also, this SmartScreen stuff can become bothersome depending on what you do on your computer and what applications you use</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/27/3271125/microsoft-comment-smartscreen-windows-8-privacy-concerns" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/27/3271125/microsoft-comment-smartscreen-windows-8-privacy-concerns</a></p>
<p>I read another article somewhere discussing the flaws of Windows 8’s SmartScreen, but they were using the same RC that I was using, so the info I have now is a little dated. I might get the full release and see if my mind changes, but there was nothing “big” or “new” about it other than that it looks like Windows Phone7 and the explorer takes less memory in the taskmngr.</p>
