    <title>gauss gun not cool</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gauss-gun-not-cool/12756</link>
    <description>Hi guys

I used to play a lot of Half Life, it was my favorite game back then and I even enjoyed it more than Counter Strike. 

What I loved to do back then was to use the Gauss Gun. It was a really cool weapon because you could shot yourself into the sky and it was also a risky weapon because when you missed a shot there is a chance that people hit you back.

I don&#39;t really like the Gauss Gun in Black Mesa. I tried it and I was not able to shot myself to higher places, I also think that it charges to slow.

Is there a reason why the Gauss Gun behaves like that right now?</description>

<p>You need to get your facts checked. The Gauss Gun didn’t do that in single player HL, in addition to that, the charge time was also significantly slower than in multiplayer. Fire up the game and type in impulse 101 when the game loads some random level you choose and check yourself. They behave identically.</p>

            <p>Gauss jumping was not in the single-player Half-Life, so why would you expect it to be in single-player Black Mesa?</p>

            <p>To try and attempt to answer your hinted-at and obvious questions, the Tau Cannon is arguably the best weapon in the game, so making it charge slowly (aside from being closer to realism) is a way to account for its extreme power.  If it was an instant-shot-esque weapon, it would probably imablance the game’s difficulty.</p>
<p>As for launching yourself into the air, or “Gauss jumping”, this was primarily used in the Deathmatch mode of the original Half-Life.  I somewhat doubt that the BM staff will include this in their version of Deathmatch, but it may crop up at some point.  Accounting for this feature in the single-player game would have required the developers to ensure everything was out of range height-wise, which would have potentially led to some aesthetic and functional issues.</p>
