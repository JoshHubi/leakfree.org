    <title>Won&#39;t let me download from any mirrors?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wont-let-me-download-from-any-mirrors/9615</link>
    <description>I have tried all of the mirrors, including the torrent, but after the countdown for the download ends, it wont download. Period. I tried the &quot;If the download does not start automatically, click here.&quot; buttons, and they let to broken file downloads. If anyone else has this problem, how can i fix it? Please, and thank you. *EDIT* Also I do have pop-ups unblocked.</description>
