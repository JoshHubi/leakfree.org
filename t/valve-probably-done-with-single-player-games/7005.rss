Discuss. It&#39;s kind of an odd, vague statement, but it sounds like Gabe is saying he doesn&#39;t want to do any more games that don&#39;t have the option to play alone. Maybe he&#39;s not including the final part of Half Life, and if he isn&#39;t...well is that really so crazy, for Valve at least? Consider their main franchises: Half Life, Portal, Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress, and Counter Strike. 2 of those, TF and CS, are multiplayer only. L4D can be played alone but is geared towards multiplayer. Portal 2 has co-op. Half Life has Death Match. Then there&#39;s Alien Swarm, and Dota 2 coming soon, both multiplayer games.

In any case, as long as they release the final Half Life like normal, I&#39;ll be happy with whatever they do afterward, since they make fun, innovative MP games. It&#39;d be a shame, since they&#39;ve proven they can make awesome SP storylines too, but I&#39;d be okay with it.</description>

<pre><code>AND GOD SAID, "VALVE SHALT NO LOONGER MAKE ANY SINGLE PLAYER GAMES, FOR MULTILAYER IS WHERE THE MONEY IS AT"


 And in the book of Gabe Newell according to Doug Lombardi it was stated that valve whored themselves out to those who touched themselves while they played Call of Duty Black OPS. Therefore Valve collapsed under their own greed and sold their soul to Activision. And then the world was pounded with earthquakes, tsunami's, tornadoes, and hot pockets. Which caused global warming and ultimately the melting of the polar ice caps causing a new ice age.

 Prophecy!

<p>How’s that for a bible discussion ManlyStump?</p>

            <p>the whole article sounds purely speculative to me. the last part contradicts the other parts leading into the final impression that the whole article basically said nothing at all.</p>
<p>I think it’s bullshit and not very convincing. as written in another post: trust valve(we can sill afterwards build a huge scientific facility underground including an insane AI and put gabe newell in it to show him some singleplayer.)</p>

<p>Well, because of the extremely vague line I quoted from the article, I think that this is some web-site trying to get hits and it’s pulling people in with their title. Because people think they have to read in between the lines to find some sort of hidden message, they over look the absolute vagueness and lack of hard referenced FACTS that would normally come along with an article. And 90% of people eat the shit right off the floor. HENCE, this thread…</p>

<p>Did Valve (Other than Portal <em>Original</em> and I suppose the episodes, but those technically aren’t even full games.) ever put any major titles out that were strictly single player? They all had some sort of “support connected, non-solo gaming, in some way, at all levels.”</p>
<p>Doesn’t sound like anything new to me. All it means is that HL:E3 could/might/will have have “support connected, non-solo gaming, in some way, at all levels.”  Sounds pretty vague when you actually read that last line of the first paragraph. Made me neglect the rest of the article with that opening.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>HL1 had built-in multiplayer online and over LAN, many HL1 mods were strictly multiplayer, HL2 was released in pretty much the same way and so were all their other games. Anyway, the source engine allows more than 1 player in any game, with only a few console commands, that’s why when HL2 SP was leaked, many people downloaded it before the retail release and were playing with other people via LAN or a dedicated server.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is true. By now, with their track record, it’s better not to believe anything related to Valve until you see it or play it for yourself.</p>
<p>Also, I just noticed this myself, and it’s kind of been stated, but just to reiterate, this is completely second hand. The writer of that ipad app just says, “Portal 2 will probably be Valve’s last game with an isolated single-player experience.” He claims that Gabe told him they “want all of their future games to support connected, non-solo gaming, in some way, at all levels.” But there’s no other evidence of that. So it’s even less likely than if Gabe said it, which would already be pretty sketchy.</p>
<p>Even if it this turns out to be what Gabe said, it sounds like, at the most, they want all of their future games to have multiplayer support in all their parts. Meaning there could be games like Halo in their future - games that have discrete single player and multiplayer parts, but with multiplayer support for the single player (so one or more people could play, as opposed to a separate co-op campaign which requires two people, ala Portal 2). That could be interesting. Maybe we’d finally get an official world model of Gordon Freeman.</p>

<p>There won’t be another Portal anyway I think. But Valve MUST keep on doing singleplayer games rather than focusing on coop or even worse multiplayer games like Counter-Strike, Deathmatch and Team Fortress. I’m tired of game developers only producing multiplayer games like Treyarch and Infinity Ward do with Call of Duty. (I admit that I like the singleplayer very much though)</p>

<p>Solution to idiotic AI. Combine who are player controlled…when Overwatch can get more troops, it will send more players who are combine after you (Dropships). Gordon Freeman is played through everyone one at a certain time depending on if the player who is Gordon dies. alphabetically the next person. Anderson dies, Bob goes next. If Bob dies, it’s Charlie. Unless there’s some kind of intelligence test for Freeman or who has his attitude most. Rebels are controllable. (Virtual Reality…?). Sweet, there you go. no more dumbass rebels too. Scientists…I have no fucking idea. Xen creatures could be controlled as well. Combine vs headcrabs vs freeman. All hate eachother and all players. There should be some sort of brain scan to detect if a person joining has the sole intention of ruining the fun or is under 16 (or the M rating) or so.</p>
<p>When you die, you disconnect? That could be a possibility. So you have people who come in and aren’t fucking “metagaming” and going directly to where they last saw Freeman. Typing may become obsolete and mic channels MUCH better quality and 3 dimensional, unless you have some sort of radio. (Rebels and combine). It can break and you can lose communication and be killed. Worlds would be massive.</p>

            <p>I honestly despise Multiplayer at this point. Over the internet you never know who’s on the other end and they can be a jackass and ruin the entire mood of the game for you. So I stick soley to single player games at this point. Even to the point when I got Call of Duty Black ops for christmas I played single player then sold it away. Never touched borderlands multi. It’s just not fun with the hacking, the greifers, ect. Singleplayer I can play how I want, explore how I want, theres not a push for “Come on lets go I wanna kill things!” The 1 vs 1 fighting games are really one of the few games I touch multiplayer wise because thats how they were designed.</p>
<p>I don’t mind if it’s in the same room. Oh I don’t care if it’s a multiplayer game in the same room, that makes it all the more fun. But games like Dragon Age, Mass Effect, I can’t see them as being multiplayer. Never can.</p>

<p>Well, because of the extremely vague line I quoted from the article, I think that this is some web-site trying to get hits and it’s pulling people in with their title. Because people think they have to read in between the lines to find some sort of hidden message, they over look the absolute vagueness and lack of hard referenced FACTS that would normally come along with an article. And 90% of people eat the shit right off the floor. HENCE, this thread…</p>

            <p>Did Valve (Other than Portal <em>Original</em> and I suppose the episodes, but those technically aren’t even full games.) ever put any major titles out that were strictly single player? They all had some sort of “support connected, non-solo gaming, in some way, at all levels.”</p>
<p>Doesn’t sound like anything new to me. All it means is that HL:E3 could/might/will have have “support connected, non-solo gaming, in some way, at all levels.”  Sounds pretty vague when you actually read that last line of the first paragraph. Made me neglect the rest of the article with that opening.</p>

<p>Yeah. If Episode 3 contains coop, I’m going to have to send an email to Gabe. I’d be fine with DM, but coop just isn’t HL’s style (I’m not counting Decay, because it was only a bonus added to the PS2 version, not a full game, nor was it that good gameplay wise, playing by yourself.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I hope you mean “If episode 3 is only coop” because complaining about Valve expanding on a formula and giving you more content sounds kinda silly to me.</p>

<p>I hope they don’t start doing “Left 4 Dead singleplayer” with bots, that would really suck<br>
If they can make bots as good as their scripted NPCs, than that’s ok, but L4D-style bots won’t cut it</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re right, the scripted NPCs always work beautifully. I loved restarting Episode 1 fourteen times because Alyx would get trapped or become non-responsive.</p>
