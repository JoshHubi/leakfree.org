    <title>What sports/physical activities do you practice?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-sports-physical-activities-do-you-practice/161</link>
    <description>Personally I do skatboarding and bodybuilding (damn I hate this word, I feel like if I wanted to become a body builder or something, but I only want to get a bit of shape).

In the past I did a bit of Archery but I stopped due to lack of time.

What about you guys and gals?</description>

            <p>You know, I actually respect guys who go to the gym to do some bodybuilding. As long as they don’t overdo it =\</p>
<p>I used to row a lot, but I quit that because I didn’t like it. After that I did several years of lazy.</p>
<p>Now I find myself dancing. You know, like ballroom dancing and stuff. I do that three times a week now, the fourth to be coming if I get accepted to my school’s demonstration-team. I also do some generic workout stuff.</p>

<p>Sorry but when I’m squatting or deadlifting 510lbs I couldn’t care less what you think of my attire. Who seriously wears all that to the gym? I wear a cutoff and basketball shorts and probably get far more done than you do.</p>
<p>/rant, yes mad.</p>

            <p>I bike. (Road and a lot) I did weightlifting for about a year, but I stopped this winter. Haven’t done any regular physical stuff since. Laaazzzyy. Ah well, I’m making a summer resolution: I’ll make it up.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>/\ tell that to my triceps!</p>
<p>Anyway, I bike, I do stairs, stretching like pushups, chinups, situps, anything good for my back. I earned gold in Physical Fitness in Cadets when I was 18. I was 6 push ups off from receiving Excellence. I enjoy going to the “Y” sometimes for a day pass to go and swim all I want too. I don’t enjoy going to big gyms, it waists time, people don’t wear the proper clothes (undershirt, T-shirt, hoody and pants), talk too much and many of them don’t get anything done. It’s not a social! If they don’t want to sweat, they shouldn’t be there.</p>
