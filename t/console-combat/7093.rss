    <description>Allright, we have a fight here between PS3 and Xbox 360 .....again .....I know that most of you guys are more PC fans than console, but still....which of these consoles is better for you and why ? 

for me it´s PS3 ....I´m more familiar with it than with 360, although I´m a PC-fan .....</description>

</aside>
<p>Personally, I find making such a big deal out of two words to be rather stupid. You could have just as easily moved on without even needing to make such a deal out of it in the first place, but since you did, so will I. Mainly because I’m bored.</p>
<p>I still think you’d be better served by jumping in front of a moving vehicle, but that’s apparently not going to happen. There’s simply no argument that it would be an improvement, that’s an absolute certainty. No doubt. None. At all. It’s absolutely the absolute truth. Definitely.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/bolteh">@Bolteh</a> judging by the touchscreen on the controllers, it looks like the new wii will still be fairly gimmicky and still be very casual gaming oriented. One problem with this whole touchscreen on the controller thing is it’ll cost an arm and a leg to have enough controllers to play with all your friends. Just bootcamp one of your macs or buy a pc.</p>

            <p>I’d advise waiting until after E3 so we can see what direction Nintendo are going in. Going on what I’ve read about the specs of Nintendo’s Project Cafe, I think it will be only slightly ahead of the 360 and PS3. It’s more ‘next-gen’ in the way that the PS3 and 360 were supposed to be compared to the PS2 and Xbox, not the real ‘next-gen’ as in the massive leap forward from the current generation. Although it sounds like a gimmick, having small screens in the controllers could work well if it’s done right. Overall, it seems to be designed to allow current games to be playable on a Nintendo console that will work with all Gamecube and Wii games as well.</p>
<p>As for 360 exclusives that really make a 360 worth getting, there are some, but not loads. The Halo series is good if you want fairly open battlefields with good AI to deal with, and Gears of War is good if you want to see bodybuilders shooting their way through huge numbers of aliens and destroying humanity as they mess it up. Forza 3 is better than GT5 if you want an all-round racing game, rather than loads of cars that look similar and tracks that take ages to load, but if GT6 follows Forza’s idea that racing games need to be fun as well as realistic, then Forza won’t be able to match it. Fable 2 and 3 are good if you want an action adventure with RPG elements. The main reason I got a 360 though is because the multiplatforms (that weren’t on PC) that I wanted to play ran better on the 360.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Both Sony and Microsoft claim that their respective consoles are about halfway through their expected lifecycle. This means that we probably won’t see a console by either of them before 2015-2016.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Nintendo seems to be kickstarting the “next generation” in 2012 with the release of “Project Café”, a console that is said to leave both the PS3 and 360 in the dust and isn’t a gimmick like the Wii was.</p>
<p>What does this mean for Sony and Microsoft? Will they have to rush out a new console to compete with Nintendo, or is Nintendo merely joining the “current generation” (in terms of performance) by releasing a console that is on par with both the PS3 and 360’s performance (if not slightly better)?</p>
<p>Is it still worth buying a PS3 or 360 today, knowing that a “way better” console may be hitting the shelves within the next year? Asking this bit because I have a PS3 at the moment, but was looking at getting a 360 as well… But I’m unsure whether it’s worth it considering the imminent release of a new console, the fact that I’ll have to buy a console as well as a bunch of games to begin with and the fact that I know fuck all about games for either console, so I have no idea what exclusives are worth the purchase of a 360.</p>

<p>It’s not bad at all, especially if you’re used to it. I’m not shelling out all that cash just for my one or two racing games.</p>
<p>And as bloodshot mentioned and I forgot; just plug in a controller. The only games that are better on a controller are racers and platforms and such, and those don’t need a mouse for the aiming so a controller will work just fine.</p>

<p>Hold Shift to Sprint, or hold ALT to walk. oh WOW, SO HARD.</p>
<p>Other games like racers and such may be a little better without a mouse and keyboard, but they support other forms of input, such as gamepads or Driving wheels, etc. for that reason.</p>
<p>And I hardly see how varying speeds of movement is more important than aiming? If you can run fast in real life, what good is it if you can’t actually turn your fucking body?</p>

            <p>Just use the mouse to point where you want to go. Strafing isn’t a very significant feature in a lot of games. And those that do require the side keys are things like racing games where it’s very easy just to tap the side key into a curve.</p>

<p>I did at least point out that I think navigation is better with a controller across a spectrum of game-types. I’m happy that THU2 plays fine on a KB+M, but I’d much rather play it with a controller. (If I played it at all. I think that series dies with THPS3.) Granted, it’s been years since I’ve played many games on PC, but I do recall trying to do movements that required some finesse ended up turning into a frantic tap-dancing ballet on the movement keys.  While it may work this way, the smoothness with which a thumb-stick could handle the same maneuver with a single sweep of the thumb is to be appreciated, at least to me. YMMV</p>

<p>There is no doubt in my mind that movement and navigation is far and away more precise and fluid on a controller.  Being able to have variable walking and running speeds, as well as various degrees of movement while strafing gives the controller an advantage in this. This is also true for other game types beyond shooters, be it platformers, racers, or…just about everything that isn’t a clicky-clicky puzzle game. It’s far easier and fun to move with a controller. Keyboards are quite polar in this department. You have stop, and you have go, and that’s usually it.</p>

</aside>
<p>I more or less agree with you on that. But movement in shooters is a secondary function. Aiming is the important part. Plus, it’s rarely much of a disadvantage. Raelly the only things you can’t do are move very slowly over a long distance without stop and start and strafe at an odd angle. Both of which are rare uses. Anything movement oriented can still be pretty easily played on the pc. I’ve played Tony Hawk Underground 2 on my computer with KB+M no problem.</p>
<p>Controller’s aiming problem is far more significant than computer’s moving problem. You’ve completely downplayed one and exaggerated the other. Aiming on the console isn’t even acceptable, the only reason you think it is is all the aimbot.</p>
