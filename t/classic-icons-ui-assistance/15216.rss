    <description>In addition to the weapon bucket icons, I&#39;ve been working on making ammo icons to match the models used in Juniez&#39; pack.

It&#39;s going alright so far, but I&#39;ve run into an issue that&#39;s been bothering me. The generic ammo icons are used both for ammo counts and for pickups alike.

In vanilla BM, this isn&#39;t really an issue as they decided to use images of the ammo&#39;s world models, meaning they&#39;re all in boxes or canisters for the most part.

In short I&#39;m trying to allow for the CHudItemPickup field to use separate vtf&#39;s from CHudWeaponPrimaryAmmo and CHudWeaponSecondaryAmmo, where applicable. Problem being I can&#39;t make heads or tails of source&#39;s UI framework. Anyone think they could lend me a hand?</description>

<p>Thanks, I’m glad you like it thus far.</p>
<p>As for the HUD, I feel like the default already does a pretty nice job. My main issue is mostly with the VGUI elements, hence the icons. Really the main differences between the two are the color-balancing / scanlines and fonts. That being said, I have been toying with the idea of replacing the health / armor icons, but all of this is fairly up-in-the-air at the moment.</p>
