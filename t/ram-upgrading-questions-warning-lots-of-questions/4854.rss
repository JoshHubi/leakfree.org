    <title>RAM upgrading questions. (WARNING: Lots of questions)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ram-upgrading-questions-warning-lots-of-questions/4854</link>
    <description>I&#39;m upgrading from DDR2 800mhz ram to DDR2 1066mhz RAM but I&#39;m not sure whether or not the RAM will plug in and work automatically at 1066mhz speed or whether or not I&#39;ll need to overclock it to get to that speed. I know that in order to overclock the ram I need to go to the bios, set the RAM to run at 1066mhz and raise the voltage but would the advertised voltage and speeds just need to be implemented or would I need to customly overclock the RAM? If I would need to customly overclock it how would I do that and is the upgrade even worth it? If it is worth it what products would you recommend in that are in the $100 for 4GB&#39;s range?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>If you REALLY want to upgrade, get a new motherboard.</p>
<p>That motherboard does: Dual channel DDR2 1066(OverclockMax)/800/667 Max 16GB.</p>
<p>If you aren’t interested in spending money, then don’t bother upgrading the RAM at all. Otherwise I would suggest getting a newer, DDR3 motherboard, and upgrading to either i5 or i7. With that you would get a 750w+ power supply (CORSAIR), and some DDR3 RAM (CORSAIR).</p>
<p>You would run at around $700USD for an average build of those. ($100PSU, $100~200RAM, $150~200MB, $120~350CPU)<br>
I’m assuming that your case is an Med?</p>
<p>As for overclocking, it can get difficult if the multiplier isn’t unlocked and if you don’t have 3rd party cooling. RAM overclocking is VERY dangerous, but OCing the CPU will OC the RAM safely.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>I have never tryed overclocking my CPU out fear of doing something horrible to it nor do I have any experience in RAM overclocking. I do like what you’re saying about overclocking the RAM and I may consider the CPU.</p>
<p>Here are my specs:<br>
Intel Core 2 Quad 2.4Ghz (Stock CPU cooling)<br>
Readon 5870 1GB GDDR5 VRAM (I have reasonable experience in overclocking G-cards but I haven’t bothered with this one.)<br>
Dual Channel 4GB DDR2 800Mhz RAM (G. Skill brand)<br>
600 Watt power supply<br>
Foxconn P45A-S MoBo<br>
5 120mm Case Fans<br>
1 200mm Case Fan</p>
<p>If I were to buy a better CPU cooling system how would I overclock it to 3.0Ghz if possible and what is the chance of hardware damage?</p>

            <p>Going from 800mhz to 1066mhz with DDR2 won’t show any significant real world changes if any at all so it is a complete waste of money imo.</p>
<p>My advice would be to get a decent CPU cooler and have a go at overclocking your existing rig. Quality 800mhz ram can be pushed harder and reach 1066mhz with some clever overclocking. What is your existing spec?</p>
<p>A lot of dual core CPU’s can break the 3ghz barrier easily and if you have a more expensive model may even reach 4ghz (although will probably not be stable).</p>
<p>EDIT - Are you running a 64 bit operating system? If not then you will only be utilizing a little over 3gb of ram, the rest unusable due to 32 bit operating system restraints. If your motherboard only supports 1066mhz (OC) like so then yes you will need to increase your fsb manually and adjust the ratio if you want to keep the CPU at stock speed. In other words if you plonk 1066mhz ram in there unless you change any settings it will run at 800mhz.</p>

</aside>
<p>I do that all the time, plus run a content creator (GECK), like 5 instances of FOEdit, couple of nifskope instances, ~10 tabs of web browser, calc, notepad+ and all the shizz that comes with doing stuff with 4 gigs just fine… So yeah, just OC if really needs, and put your money to better use.</p>

            <p>If you upgrade to 8 gigs, you’ll not get a big difference at all. Unless you play games, listen to music, making 3D models and running Photoshop all at once, then you should upgrade.</p>
<p>I suggest you just OC the Ram you already have, start small and OC just a little at a time over and over until it doesn’t work anymore, and go back to the last working speed and Voltage if needed. I say wait on buying more ram until you upgrade the whole computer for DDR3.</p>

            <p>Are you finding that current 4 gigs insufficient? Depends what applications are you using. I’ve got 4gb as well, but cba to screw around with a 64 bit os, and even the rough ~ 3 gigs is more than enough for what I use (and it isn’t just word processing).</p>
<p>Unless you’re running a server or workstation, you most likely won’t notice any difference from the upgrade.</p>

            <p>My mobo does support 1066mhz RAM, I am buying from <a href="http://newegg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">newegg.com</a> and I have currently 4GB of DDR2 800mhz RAM. Would an increase to 8GB of my current RAM be a better choice for performance? Also I would hold off from claiming that this stuff is getting outdated, it’s not the bleeding edge of technology but if price is a concern (Like for me) DDR2 is more then good enough to play most games. Whenever I get worried my system may be going out of date I remind myself that the Xbox 360 will stay in use till 2015 and if the Xbox has five more years of lifespan, my system will to.</p>
<p>I was just checking my mobo specifications and I noticed that on the listed acceptable RAM speeds that next to the 1066mhz entry there was this acronym O.C which I presume to mean Over-Clock. Would this mean that to reach 1066mhz speeds with my mobo I would need to overclock it or is it irellevent?<br>
Here is the link to my mobo: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813186148&amp;cm_re=foxconn_P45A-s--13-186-148--Product" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813186148&amp;cm_re=foxconn_P45A-s-<em>-13-186-148-</em>-Product</a></p>

            <p>If your board states that it supports DDR2 1066mhz RAM, it should automatically detect the speed of the RAM you are using. If it doesn’t, you will most likely have to overclock it. I am not an avid overclocker so if you have to do that ask someone else.</p>
<p>When it comes to RAM, the capacity matters much more than the bus speed. If you are upgrading for the speed only, then you won’t see much, if any difference in performance, especially since the increase in speed we’re talking about here is so small. If you are upgrading your total capacity of RAM and you want to go to a faster speed at the same time, then that’s your decision. I’m afraid both DDR2 800 and 1066 are getting outdated, however, now that the i7 boards are going to DDR3. Again, though, the bus speeds don’t matter too much.</p>
<p>As for recommended items, I would just go to <a href="http://newegg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">newegg.com</a> and search for a product with the specifications you want that has good ratings.</p>

<p>But he should have to do anything to the RAM to make it go that speed right? Just make sure it is detected correctly?  I have become curious about this…</p>
