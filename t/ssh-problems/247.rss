    <title>SSH Problems</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ssh-problems/247</link>
    <description>Anyone who has played the version with steam fix knows that the keyborad keys won&#39;t work, and that to fix the problem the CFG from the regular half-life folder has to be copied over and pasted to the ssh folder.
