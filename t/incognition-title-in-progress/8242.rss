    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/incognition-title-in-progress/8242</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;m not sure this is in the right place, but I need some help. There&#39;s this game that I&#39;m working on by myself and wanted your input.
I haven&#39;t quite worked out the story, but it&#39;s going to be a sprite-based, 2D-isometric, third-person shooter, similar to Gears of War and a mix of some other games. It runs on the game maker engine, and will have multiplayer along with a deep enticing story mode. I&#39;m setting it in the future and I plan on leaving the story open for future releases and prequels. I already have alot of stuff, like the first chapter and levels, some weapons, and a map for multiplayer.

I need some ideas on:
Story
Weapons
Multiplayer (game modes ect.)
Game Mechanics
How I can implement game mechanics(like the coding of it, I have been stuck on implementing a cover mechanic)</description>

Of course, any idea that you come up with should be fresh and original, but it’s title should be the last thing you worry about.  And it should be a real word.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Try to avoid plot themes that stink of Spielberg and his hasidic homeboy JJ Abrams</span> and gutless writer/white manservant Damon Lindelof.  Unfortunately that means no back-and-forth in the timeline to fill gaps in the story, no aliens trying to get home, and no expansive, cliched dialogue.  That should free you from any crappy plot development, but it can’t hurt to incorporate stuff you liked from books or real-life experiences and locations.  You could go to an industrial facility nearby and take pictures for textures and infrastructure, or live near an ocean or other body of water, you could use that as well.  And don’t try doing this alone, a couple of people working with you can give fresh ideas and perspective, as well as sharing the workload.  Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>I haven’t considered UDK or Unity because I thought that they were 3D only engines, but I guess I’ll do some research. Also, UDK won’t even launch on the comp I’m using, I’m thinking I need to upgrade my graphics card.</p>
<p>Edit: also my bad, I never knew HTML wasn’t a programming language. thanks</p>

<p>There are many foss game engines out there which you can build on, would be much easier, and at the end, your game wouldn’t be a bad hack. Especially if you are already a programmer, I would really recommend not using gamemaker.</p>

            <p>Do you know how to code?<br>
Judging by the fact you said you’ll be using gamemaker, I’m guessing not.<br>
Gamemaker is basically doing it wrong.<br>
If you really want to make games, learn to code, then start making them. You can’t really learn to code by making games. Not at the start anyway. If you set your goals too high too early it just won’t work. You need lots of little projects before you can contemplate one of this size.</p>

            <p>Alright, so the setting could be a parallel universe Earth where the dark ages never happened, allowing science and culture to advance without any hindrance from religion until our days, so the world is a lot more technologically and culturally advanced even though it’s actually the same year as in our universe.</p>
<p>That alone is enough to fuel some ideas for alternate history events, such as wars that never happened, stuff that happened in a different way or even made up stuff based around things going on differently in this alternate version of human history.</p>
<p>Now that you can shape a creative backstory for your game, it’s probably easier to write a plot, since you can have total creative control and still base it on real places.<br>
However, the same natural disasters that happened in our universe will happen in that one too, so take that into account.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Well I’m not sure this is in the right place, but I need some help. There’s this game that I’m working on by myself and wanted your input.<br>
I haven’t quite worked out the story, but it’s going to be a sprite-based, 2D-isometric, third-person shooter, similar to Gears of War and a mix of some other games. It runs on the game maker engine, and will have multiplayer along with a deep enticing story mode. I’m setting it in the future and I plan on leaving the story open for future releases and prequels. I already have alot of stuff, like the first chapter and levels, some weapons, and a map for multiplayer.</p>
<p>I need some ideas on:<br>
Story<br>
Weapons<br>
Multiplayer (game modes ect.)<br>
Game Mechanics<br>
How I can implement game mechanics(like the coding of it, I have been stuck on implementing a cover mechanic)</p>
