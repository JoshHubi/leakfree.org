<p>You’ve said Viktor’s Combine design is merely Star Wars Imperial space construction + Borg, right? Borg is just Imperial space construction painted black with some Giger smushed into it. Imperial space construction is just ancient Greek construction with car parts glued to the walls. Remember Giger? From the Borg designs? Gothic architecture with air conditioning parts and genitals strewn everywhere.</p>
<p>I remember sometime a long time ago there was a thread about Doom 4. I said something about how I hoped the designs were closer to the classic I and II designs, and mentioned the imp. Needless to say, some halfbrained fucknut went “HURR DURR DA IMP IZ JUSS NEKKID BALCK GGUY WHID SPIEKS ON HIM&gt;”. So fucking what? It looks great. You’d be lieing if you haven’t seen a naked black dude before, and we’ve all seen spikes. We’ve all seen glowing red eyes. We’ve all seen skeletal noses and mouths full of canines. Have we seen spikes growing out of a naked black dude with a skeletal nose, a mouth full of canines, and glowing red eyes? No. Not before Doom. That’s why it’s still a classic recognizable character.</p>
<p>Fuck, this goes back to the beginning of time. I shouldn’t have to explain this to you. I shouldn’t have to tell you that Astro Boy borrowed many design cues from Mickey Mouse’s, whose whole design is a shameless ripoff of Felix the cat. I shouldn’t have to tell you that the classic Nike swoosh logo was made by a graphic artist that couldn’t think of anything and just vomited anything on to a piece of paper just so she could make the 35 bucks and move on. As a professional artist, you should be able to know and accept these things as a history of your field. You should be able to understand that nothing new just springs out of the air, but you don’t. Your arguments have shown nothing but a sickening naivety and a longing for the impossible.</p>

<p>Fuck, I got em mixed. Yes, astro boy is a lift from Mickey. The hair spikes were supposed to evoke the feelings of trust children had gained from Mickey’s ears, and they were purposefully arranged in the same one Vertical-one Diagonal array.</p>
<p>Point still stands. In fact, point reinforced by misunderstanding.<br>
I’m going to edit the post because no one’s gonna see this one.</p>

            <p>Personally, I do not like the art style of the original beta–it seemed way too futuristic for a Half-Life game. The game we have now, although suffering from a lack of interesting enemies, is well above my standards of artistic design, at least.</p>
<p>Sides, one has to understand that to build that sort of environment back then in the Source SDK (that they had) would have been near impossible… so they had to reach a compromise of some sort.</p>

</aside>
<p>No shit you’re freelancing. I’d never fucking hire you for a long term job.</p>
<p>I was speaking in no relation to the gaming industry. I have no idea why you chose to cling onto and counter argue a point I never made.</p>
<p>Plus, my assumptions are pretty well founded in the fact that the mess you’ve been spewing from your broken cortex comes from some far off land of bullshit town. This one is a true gem though. “hurr durr gaem artiztzz dont make a original thing beacuz gaems r all steal things”. Get fucking real. I’d come back with “there’s no such thing as true originality, for creativity is just iteration of the combinations of previous innovations”, but it’s already been stated many times in this thread. If you’re actually 23 like you’ve said, and really do have nine years working in the professional art field since the ripe age of 14, I’m assuming it’s also a fact you should be fucking familiar with. Apparently not.</p>
<p>You’ve said Viktor’s Combine design is merely Star Wars Imperial space construction + Borg, right? Borg is just Imperial space construction painted black with some Giger smushed into it. Imperial space construction is just ancient Greek construction with car parts glued to the walls. Remember Giger? From the Borg designs?

<p>Regarding the legs, they are just crap. They serve for nothing apart from adding more polygons to render. The collisions are inacurate, and adding better collisions is not a trivial thing. If they use collision boxes is for a reason, performance. Calculating per-feet collision just for the seek of seeing your virtual penis, errr, I mean, legs is stupid.</p>

<p>Actually, Gabe is on the same playing field everyone else is.  Sure, it’s his company so he COULD do whatever he wants as the owner.  But from a hierarchical standpoint, he’s in pretty much the same boat.</p>
<p>Anyways, EP2 was my favorite out of the three.  Sure, it really didn’t introduce anything new, but I really liked the open environments and the art style that went with them. I also really liked the antlion nests.  That reminded me a lot of Xen (which I think it actually was modeled after).</p>

            <p>He was not the art director. Valve employees have stated a millions of times that they don’t have positions and that nobody is above nobody else. Except Newell.</p>
<p>Regarding the legs, they are just crap. They serve for nothing apart from adding more polygons to render. The collisions are inacurate, and adding better collisions is not a trivial thing. If they use collision boxes is for a reason, performance. Calculating per-feet collision just for the seek of seeing your virtual penis, errr, I mean, legs is stupid.</p>

<p>hahahahahaha… No, kid. No. That Disney bullshit doesn’t grow muscle memory. You can’t know how reflected light works if you use your imagination and put your fruity little mind to it. You can’t suddenly just know the ~700 (skeletal) muscles in the human body using nothing but intuition. Composition isn’t something that just springs up your ass and shits out your fingers. 30+ years of experience don’t sprout out from wishful thinking.</p>
<p>In that ellipsis riddled broken english you called an argument, you have successfully demonstrated how <span class="bbcode-i">little</span> you know what the fuck you’re on about.</p>

<p>no shit. thats why i dont find his concept art as impressive as everyone else. i can pick up on the colour themes and/or design elements that ive seen in other places and see similarities others cant. thats how a sharp attention to detail and your memory work together. and when i dont, usually the phrase “ive never seen that before,” is uttered, not “that concept art looks familiar.”</p>

</aside>
<p>reverse engineering is an art in itself. IBM had no one to steal from in 1975. niether did gary kildall or tim patterson. but bill gates did. so did steve wozniack. the concepts behind developing software and creating a work of art, or writing a song or writing a book…are the same. the only difference is the medium the author uses. have you ever heard the saying “everything is an artform?”</p>
<p>the original deus ex came out in 2000. i can make my comparisons that anatonov’s hl2 concept art looks like a mix beween the borg from star trek and the imperial army from star wars like i did in my previous posts. thats where the mass effect and star wars 1313 comparisons come from because they are both just star wars video games.</p>
<p>EDIT: i knew i forgot one…anyone remember System Shock?</p>

<p>The new AVP game had the ability to see your legs and feet, and it worked incredibly well; the position of them would change depending on what surface you were on. The Alien’s first person perspective was quite impressive, especially with all the wall jumping.</p>

<p>judging an artist by his concept art is pathetic. saying he poured his heart and sole into HL2 only to get screwed by valve is a simple case of you not understand the difference between doing things for discovery, and doing things for yourself.</p>

<p>HE IS JUST GOOD AT STEALING OTHER PEOPLES IDEAS. alot like bill gates.</p>
<p>and no art is not defined by taking ideas from other people and simply reiterating them with some other ideas taken from other people thrown into the mix. if youre saying good artists borrow, great artists steal…then youre calling any successful artist a thief. that is worse than xalener’s argument.</p>
