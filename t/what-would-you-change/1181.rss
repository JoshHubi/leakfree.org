    <description>What would you change in Half - Life? Think about the story, the characters, the weapons, or anything, any minor detail... For example would you like Gordon better if he&#39;d talk?Or maybe u&#39;d like MR. FRIENDLY to be the Endboss instead of Nihilant? :smiley:</description>

            <p>Teeth probably, but then it’d still be a much less accurate left-handed toss than a controlled and balanced two handed throw.  And also while all that is going on your other weapon would become one-handed, and hence much less accurate at minimum…</p>

            <p>…so while holding a 2-handed weapon you can throw a grenade with…your 3rd hand?  …your foot?<br>
It makes sense to require at least one hand free to throw it, and two free to control it best.</p>

            <p>I’m going <span class="bbcode-i">way</span> over the top here, but I still wants it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">- Larger.</span> I’d love for Half-Life 2 to be far more expansive and explorable than it was. I don’t mean like Far Cry 2’s size of map, but enough so that the path isn’t so damn obviously linear. Large enough so that you can choose an alternative route. The <span class="bbcode-i">incredible</span> advantage to this sort of gameplay is that it is very flexible - you can go at your own pace, explore what you want, go where you want and take in as much of the storyline as you want. It’s the perfect style of gameplay in my opinion. You could even take side-missions (as poor as that sounds), such as blowing up the gunship at New Little Odessa.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">- Graphics.</span> Like Crysis. Source is showing its age. As much as I love it and will remain loyal to it, new technology and games such as GTA IV and Crysis are undeniably better.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">- More wildlife.</span> If it was a free-roam landscape, it would be fantastic to run into Xen wildlife, perhaps come across a small antlion tunnel, bullsquid lair, or houndeye pack.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">- Day/Night cycle.</span> I saw HL2 as more about the journey, and a good day/night cycle combined with larger maps would fit perfectly.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">- Limited amount of weapons</span>. Although many people find it frustrating, I think having a limited number of weapons leads to far greater control and freedom in the end. I found in Half-Life that I’d forget about half the weapons and just stick to a select few. I love the identity that you create for yourself when you select your weapons. I encountered it first in Far Cry, where you could be silent, stealthy and quick with a machete, silenced MP5 and a sniper rifle. That was all I needed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">- More detailed environments.</span> I loved the details in HL2 - they were so subtle and small but they could reveal huge details of the plot and background. Exploration is one of the keys of HL2’s success for me, and I’d love to see this on a huge scale. You could be trekking across an old Eastern European railway at night and come across a small house in the distance. When you arrive, you find a small light and a basement, and down there you could discover something important (but not necessarily vital) to the story. Small details like that really make a game come alive.</p>
