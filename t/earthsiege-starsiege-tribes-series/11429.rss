    <title>Earthsiege/ Starsiege/ Tribes series</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/earthsiege-starsiege-tribes-series/11429</link>
    <description>I decided to dig this underrated//dying [color=lime]sci-fi-fantasy-mech-similator-fps series back up for appreciation and nostalgia and what not

The newest game in the series is Tribes: Ascend (which is f2p and pretty adicting at quake-like levels as it has a high skill ceiling)

It all started with Metaltech: Earthsiege, which was a mech similation game about a rag tag team of humans fighting robotic hybrids called &quot;cybrids&quot; accross the solar system

Earthsiege 2 continues this little war

Starsiege (also known as Earthsiege 3, confusing isnt it?)  which is like the last game in the little trilogy (you can find vids on youtube for more background)

Then there came Starsiege: Tribes (which is initially a spinoff game) that pioneered a new type of competitive fps, as it had bhopping mechanics coupled with skiing (maps were large so skiing was highly emphsized the &quot;skiing&quot; mechanic)

from this popularity, tribes 2 ensured, somwhat continued the story from the earthsiege/starsiege series but later evolved into a purly multiplayer fps

Tribes vengence game afterwards but kind of killed the series

Then Tribes: ascend came out in 2011 and revived the series from tribes 2
[color=lime]so the series is pretty much no longer dead, unless hirez screws up

[b][u]Heres a timeline of the series&#39; lore, but look to the purple text before reading[/u][/b][/size]
[url]https://wiki.theexiled.pwnageservers.com/Tribes_Timeline_(Complete)[/url]
[color=red]*TAKE NOTE BEFORE READING THE ABOVE*
[color=magenta]in wiki, the articles will be written in cybrid language; the stuff below will elaborate:

[u][b]The Language[/size][/b][/u]
[COLOR=&#39;Wheat&#39;]Cybrids communicate with a modified version of English that looks and sounds machine-like. The rules of Cybrid grammar are as follows:


Proper names and pronouns are enclosed in brackets &lt;&gt; Ex: &lt;Luna&gt;


Important nouns, objects, ideas, and integers use the reverse brackets &gt;&lt;. The more important the subject is, the more are brackets used. No more than three, however. Ex: &gt;&gt;&gt;Imperial Knights&lt;&lt;&lt;.


Important verbs or actions are enclosed with colons. Ex: :Eradicate: the humananimals.


Additional colons can be used to add stress to a verb. Again, no more than three. Ex: :::Eradicate::: the human\\animals.


Colons are also used in references and designations, or to separate the object from the integer. Ex: &quot;:Eliminate: the human\\animals ref:::&gt;&gt;Rebels&lt;&lt;.&quot;


Back slashes are used to separate objects, nouns, and ideas in multilayered integers. Ex: Human\\animals. &quot;Human&quot; is the initial designation. &quot;Animal&quot; is the integer that designates humans as different from the Next. &quot;Animal&quot; vs. &quot;Machine&quot; or &lt;unit&gt;.


Forward slashes are used to separate verbs or action ideals in multilayered integers. Ex: Offline//burst the human\\animals.


Prometheus is referred to as &lt;First-Thought//Giver-of-Will&gt;, which is commonly shortened to either &lt;First-Thought&gt; or &lt;Giver-of-Will&gt;. Also, Cybrids do not refer to themselves as Cybrids, as that is a human\\animal term. Instead, they call themselves &#39;&#39;The NEXT&#39;&#39;, which alludes to the fact that they think of themselves as the next step in evolution.


Full example:


ACKNOWLEDGE//SUBMIT! Inefficiency\\lapse has allowed//permitted human\\animal war &lt;units&gt; to reach//obtain surface landing. Alert//notify &lt;Protectors-of-Giver-of-Will&gt; ref:::&gt;&gt;&gt;Platinum Guard&lt;&lt;&lt;. Exercise//implement priority &gt;protocol&lt; Designate::: A001-LI965 Eliminate//offline//burst all invaders! Do not allow//permit the human\\vermin to reach//annoy//trouble &lt;Giver-of-Will&gt;!

source: [url]https://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Cybrids-(Starsiege)[/url]


Other notes:
-The Wilderzone is the term given to the areas in galaxy/universe controlled by the tribal humans and not the Earth Empire

-In various games, there are in-game encyclopedias that flash on the screen, all of which include additional information, which have been archived by the timeline, this &quot;encyclopedia&quot; is refered to as the &quot;human and cybrid&quot; encyclopedia

-the reason wikipedia themselves havent archived much info on this game series is because most of the info the community know about is impossible to cite (because wikipedia just doesnt understand that some things are impossible to cite)


A wiki was created to formally archive the lore and what nots about the series:
[url]https://wiki.theexiled.pwnageservers.com/Main_Page[/url]

what are your opinions on the series? i hope the best future for it, its so unfairly underrated

*edit*
as of 10/11/12 i will start using (semi-moderate) cybrid language while writing articles on any related earthsiege\\starsiege\\tribes for the sake of the fandom spirit

[b][u]**edit** (11/22/12)[/b][/u]
I made a Steam Greenlight Discussion on the whole Earthsiege series (this extends to every game set in the Earthsiege universe) Go check it out!

<p>I never played the earthsiege games when I was younger, but I heard a lot of good things about them later on. I did play starsiege: tribes from the release ( 1998 ) for a long time and it was an amazing game for it’s time. Basically no other game was fps+z at the time. It had first and third person view, observer, in game irc chat, an in game map editor, a good server browser and tons of other things games today still don’t get right. The guys at Dynamix also released all of the necessary tools to make custom mods/scripts/maps on your own for free. It was truly ahead of it’s time. Sometimes I still hop on and play a few matches in t1.</p>
<p>T2 was a lot of fun as well. I tried T:V, but it died fast.</p>
<p>T:A is good fun. Free to Play has made it so there are at least a decent amount of players even a year after release, but sadly we have no mods or community mapping/skinning etc. anymore because of the business model of selling their own skins/weapons and so forth. If you haven’t played Tribes Ascend I would give it a shot. It is free after all and there are several game types including arena, ctf, death match, capture and hold, and another version of ctf called blitz where the flag changes location after each capture.</p>

<p>even without mods, T:A was still a real addicting shooter.</p>
<p>i hear hirez may even add HERCs (the earth empire’s mechs in earthsiege) and HAVOCs (those bomber and heavy transports in T:2)</p>

            <p>The series had a rather well written story, though no wiki has ever been provided, so informational sources are quite scattered around the internet</p>
<p>the best timeline i found was here:  <a href="https://wiki.theexiled.pwnageservers.com/Tribes_Timeline_(Complete" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wiki.theexiled.pwnageservers.com/Tribes_Timeline_(Complete</a>)</p>
<p>the above is the timline of the WHOLE series, they just use tribes as the name because tribes are the most recent games in the series</p>
<p>i will add it to OP</p>

            <p>I decided to dig this underrated//dying [color=lime]sci-fi-fantasy-mech-similator-fps series back up for appreciation and nostalgia and what not</p>
<p>The newest game in the series is Tribes: Ascend (which is f2p and pretty adicting at quake-like levels as it has a high skill ceiling)</p>
<p>It all started with Metaltech: Earthsiege, which was a mech similation game about a rag tag team of humans fighting robotic hybrids called “cybrids” accross the solar system</p>
<p>Earthsiege 2 continues this little war</p>
<p>Starsiege (also known as Earthsiege 3, confusing isnt it?)  which is like the last game in the little trilogy (you can find vids on youtube for more background)</p>
<p>Then there came Starsiege: Tribes (which is initially a spinoff game) that pioneered a new type of competitive fps, as it had bhopping mechanics coupled with skiing (maps were large so skiing was highly emphsized the “skiing” mechanic)</p>
<p>from this popularity, tribes 2 ensured, somwhat continued the story from the earthsiege/starsiege series but later evolved into a purly multiplayer fps</p>
<p>Tribes vengence game afterwards but kind of killed the series</p>
<p>Then Tribes: ascend came out in 2011 and revived the series from tribes 2<br>
[color=lime]so the series is pretty much no longer dead, unless hirez screws up</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Heres a timeline of the series’ lore, but look to the purple text before reading</span></span>[/size]<br>
<a href="https://wiki.theexiled.pwnageservers.com/Tribes_Timeline_(Complete)" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wiki.theexiled.pwnageservers.com/Tribes_Timeline_(Complete)</a><br>
[color=red]<em>TAKE NOTE BEFORE READING THE ABOVE</em><br>
[color=magenta]in wiki, the articles will be written in cybrid language; the stuff below will elaborate:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">The Language[/size]</span></span><br>
[COLOR=‘Wheat’]Cybrids communicate with a modified version of English that looks and sounds machine-like. The rules of Cybrid grammar are as follows:</p>
<p>Proper names and pronouns are enclosed in brackets &lt;&gt; Ex: </p>
<p>Important nouns, objects, ideas, and integers use the reverse brackets &gt;&lt;. The more important the subject is, the more are brackets used. No more than three, however. Ex: &gt;&gt;&gt;Imperial Knights&lt;&lt;&lt;.</p>
<p>Important verbs or actions are enclosed with colons. Ex: :Eradicate: the humananimals.</p>
<p>Additional colons can be used to add stress to a verb. Again, no more than three. Ex: :::Eradicate::: the human\animals.</p>
<p>Colons are also used in references and designations, or to separate the object from the integer. Ex: “:Eliminate: the human\animals ref:::&gt;&gt;Rebels&lt;&lt;.”</p>
<p>Back slashes are used to separate objects, nouns, and ideas in multilayered integers. Ex: Human\animals. “Human” is the initial designation. “Animal” is the integer that designates humans as different from the Next. “Animal” vs. “Machine” or .</p>
<p>Forward slashes are used to separate verbs or action ideals in multilayered integers. Ex: Offline//burst the human\animals.</p>
<p>Prometheus is referred to as &lt;First-Thought//Giver-of-Will&gt;, which is commonly shortened to either  or . Also, Cybrids do not refer to themselves as Cybrids, as that is a human\animal term. Instead, they call themselves ‘‘The NEXT’’, which alludes to the fact that they think of themselves as the next step in evolution.</p>
<p>Full example:</p>
<p>ACKNOWLEDGE//SUBMIT! Inefficiency\lapse has allowed//permitted human\animal war  to reach//obtain surface landing. Alert//notify  ref:::&gt;&gt;&gt;Platinum Guard&lt;&lt;&lt;. Exercise//implement priority &gt;protocol&lt; Designate::: A001-LI965 Eliminate//offline//burst all invaders! Do not allow//permit the human\vermin to reach//annoy//trouble !</p>

<p>Other notes:<br>
-The Wilderzone is the term given to the areas in galaxy/universe controlled by the tribal humans and not the Earth Empire</p>
<p>-In various games, there are in-game encyclopedias that flash on the screen, all of which include additional information, which have been archived by the timeline, this “encyclopedia” is refered to as the “human and cybrid” encyclopedia</p>
<p>-the reason wikipedia themselves havent archived much info on this game series is because most of the info the community know about is impossible to cite (because wikipedia just doesnt understand that some things are impossible to cite)</p>
<p>A wiki was created to formally archive the lore and what nots about the series:<br>
<a href="https://wiki.theexiled.pwnageservers.com/Main_Page" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wiki.theexiled.pwnageservers.com/Main_Page</a></p>
<p>what are your opinions on the series? i hope the best future for it, its so unfairly underrated</p>
<p><em>edit</em><br>
as of 10/11/12 i will start using (semi-moderate) cybrid language while writing articles on any related earthsiege\starsiege\tribes for the sake of the fandom spirit</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[u]<strong>edit</strong> (11/22/12)</span>[/u]<br>
I made a Steam Greenlight Discussion on the whole Earthsiege series (this extends to every game set in the Earthsiege universe) Go check it out!<br>
