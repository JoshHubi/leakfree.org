    <title>Game opens, and promptly closes again.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-opens-and-promptly-closes-again/9518</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been having some difficulty with my game. It worked perfectly fine before but my game was windowed [b]with border[/b], so I closed it and added -noborder to the launch options.

Game no longer worked and I was stuck with a game that opened, and then immediately closed again. Removed the -noborder line, still no luck.

Removed the game, reinstalled, no luck. (5 times).

currently clueless  :frowning: .
Edit:
No crash dump either.</description>

            <p>I managed to fix it. If you set the launch options to contain the command “-safe” without the quotations marks and launch the game once it should launch in a really low resolution. Set the resolution to whatever you prefer, close the game and you can remove the launch option and it should run fine.</p>

            <p>Fixed it myself: rename the BMS folder to blackmesasource; it breaks the text files but the game is 100% functional.</p>

            <p>This is also happening to me, however I didn’t add the -noborder command line.</p>
<p>I tried to execute, and immediately the game crashed.</p>
