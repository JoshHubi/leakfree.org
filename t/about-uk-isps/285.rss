    <title>About UK - ISP&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/about-uk-isps/285</link>
    <description>This thread is intended to make Virgin broadband users aware of the biggest con out of all ISP&#39;s so far in the UK. Here is my experience:

Virgin Media Broadband is now the worst ISP of all time!

So my internet connection used to be 2MB (UK terms), and I always recieved a constant download rate of 250kb/s ALL THE TIME.

So one day I get a letter from virgin internet, which stated that all 2MB users will be upgraded to 10MB for free! At first, this news had really hyped me up. So after couple of weeks, without any knowledge of when the upgrade would happen, I decided to download a game on steam and I noticed that the download rate was incredibly high (1.1mb/s). So I was jumping in joy to find that my ISP has been upgraded! So, what went wrong?

So the upgrade from 2MB to 10MB is huge! However, I noticed the biggest, shittest flaw! I started downloading huge-files from steam, and after 10 minutes of amazing d/l speeds, the connection dipped to something like 250kb/s, which is basically 2MB connection again. So I was thinking &quot;WTF!&quot;, and the only thing that came to my mind is &quot;the upgrade is not fully completed yet&quot;, but whoa, how wrong I was! IT TURNS OUT THAT VIRGIN HAVE INTRODUCED SPEED CAPS! Speed caps had started from 2007/8 and it hardly effected 2MB users! Read the following statement from Virgin:

   
[quote]
 &quot;Peak hours count as 4pm to midnight, and Virgin claim that only the top 5% of downloaders on each tier will be affected.

    Those on tier M who download over 350MB during peak hours will have their downstream speed restricted to 1Mbps, and upstream to 128Kbps, for four hours.

    Those on tier L who download over 750MB during peak hours will have their downstream speed restricted to 2Mbps, and upstream to 192Kbps, for four hours.

    The top rung service, XL, will see users downloading over 3GB in peak hours having their downstream speed restricted to 5Mbps, and 256Kbps upstream.
[/quote]

In other words, if I download more than 700MB during the peak hours (between 4PM till 11pm), then I will be capped for an amazing 4 hours! So if I mistakely download 700mb at 11.59pm, the cap will take place until 4am, where it has passed the off-peak hours ages ago.

So what now? In time, I am going to change my ISP to 02 Internet!

PS: anyone with Virgin internet is getting conned.</description>

            <p>My isp caps torrents and other encrypted traffic (like https or ftp, or counter strike) during peak-hours, from 4pm to midnight, but as I refused to change to the new 2wire modem, and kept using the old fashion speedstream I bought in 2006, all I have to do is reset my modem and the cap doesn’t affect me for 24 hours.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was unaware until I was upgraded to 10mb. Didn’t really see the effects on 2mb.</p>

            <p>It turns out that speed caps/throttling happens to many other ISP’s in the UK. I noticed it until I was upgraded to 10MB. I guess there’s nothing much I can do.</p>

<p>You’re just starting to complain about speed caps? In Australia it’s f*cking ridiculous. I’ve got a 2GB limit which drops to from 1mb/s to 100kb/s after the first gig! After 2GB has been used it drops further to DIAL-UP SPEEDS. Honestly my, internet connection is probably the greatest source of rage in my life!</p>
<p>I would happily live with a 250kb/s speed if it wasn’t capped. Trade internet plans with me and see who turns out angrier.</p>
<p>God, even reading this has pissed me off. I’m gonna go practice my stabbing…</p>

<p>Wow! My connection speed stays stable at 850kb download no matter how much i d/l. I’m with Pipex btw. I don’t know what i’d do if i were you, the internet is like the best thing of life</p>
