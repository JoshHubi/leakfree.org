    <title>Xen not loading (v1.0)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xen-not-loading-v1-0/62975</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;ve jumped several times on the portal in last scene at lambda bunker chapter and after watching cinematic and Nihilanth palms a portal or some planet, the game stucks not loading next chapter, the Xen. Like i said i have tried 3-4 times from my last save and same thing happened every time.

But i think i have solved the problem. I was jumping (using long jump) onto the portal from random places not over ladder. After tried to jump on the portal from top of the ladder it is fixed and i could able to travel Xen without a problem.</description>
