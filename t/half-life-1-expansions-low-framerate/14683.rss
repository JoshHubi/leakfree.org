    <title>Half-Life 1 + Expansions low framerate</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-1-expansions-low-framerate/14683</link>
    <description>So I just got a new laptop that&#39;s pretty nice, at least for what I&#39;m used to. But the weird thing is, I&#39;m getting a pretty low frame rate (45 fps) in Half-Life 1, Opposing Force, and Blue Shift. Which is weird because I get over 100 FPS in the stand alone version of Sven coop, which is the same engine as Half-Life. And I run other games such as Black Mesa at a pretty decent framerate at moderately high settings. I turned of VSync in the game options and in my Nvidia graphics options and that still did not fix the problem. I haven&#39;t had this problem on any other computer and I was wondering if anyone here knows how to fix it.  I made sure my graphics drivers are up to date as well. Here is what I&#39;ve got:

Computer Type: (Star Wars Special Edition) HP Pavilion Notebook

Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz  2.59 GHz (Dual Core)
GPU: Nvidia GeForce 940M
RAM: 8.00 GB
System Type: 64-Bit Operating System, x64-based processor
Resolution: 1920 x 1080, 60Hz
Running on Windows 10 Home</description>

            <p>I figured it out, oddly enough, running it with my integrated graphics instead of the Geforce card got it to over 100 fps.</p>

<p>Try setting the renderer / render mode to OpenGL if it isn’t already - Windows 10 tends to perform very poorly with older versions of Direct3D.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I had to deal with a laptop, but it sounds to me like HL1 goldsrc is using your integrated graphics card. I’d try looking into disabling that or forcing it to use your dedicated card instead.</p>

</aside>
<p>Modern integrated graphics cards should be able to handle games like Half-Life quite easily (assuming no compatibility problems), even at high settings / resolutions.</p>
