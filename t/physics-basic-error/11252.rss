    <description>Hi everyone, let&#39;s go to the point. If you jump in a train, you jump with the same horizontal speed. I don&#39;t speech very good english so here is an image to explain it better.

Why I telling you this?, well start a new game and try to jump in the monorail, you will see that Gordon stands in the air and don&#39;t take the train horizontal speed, so he &quot;jump backwards&quot;.
It&#39;s basic for a game and this is a very good game, we don&#39;t want to see that kind of things ruining this gift of the gods called blackmesasource.</description>

            <p>It’s like this in every Half-Life game, regardless of whether it uses Source or Goldsrc.</p>
<p>It sucks, but oh well.</p>

            <p>I think on one of the early versions of HL1 you can jump in the tram and you will land where you jumped from, but then valve broke it and never bothered fixing it even in source</p>

            <p>This is a problem for some people, for others it works fine. As far as I know no one has worked out why.</p>
