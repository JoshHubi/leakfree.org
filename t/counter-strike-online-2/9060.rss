            <p>The gun noises, the sound effects are all the same as before. I do like the map’s visual upgrades. It looks different. Not necessarily better. I think it’s a bit washed out, actually.</p>
<p>The gameplay looks pretty much identical to CSS.</p>
<p>CS:GO was boasting tons of new physics, if I recall, plus all new weapon models and animations (plus actual NEW weapons like the Molotov). For instance, reloading the M4 and hitting the bolt release instead of pulling the forward assist like in CSS. I don’t really see how this is “better.”</p>
<p>Even so, the crowd was really into it. Someone should mod in the crowd noises for when people die.</p>

            <p>The “graphics”… if by that you mean work put into a level, CSGO definitely beats O2. I’m glad that they’re at least using Source, because it would be sad to think that there are people somewhere, playing CS with the wrong engine.</p>

            <p>I’m sorry, but I don’t understand all the rage at CS: GO. Imo it’s good and it fixed everything I had problems with in CS: S. Better hitbox detection, proper and precise aiming, ect. I haven’t gotten the chance to play CS: 1.6 yet so mabie I’m not fully in the mix. I love the original HL: Deathmatch and 1.6 uses the same engie, so I may like it better than Source.</p>
<p>Until I can get a copy of 1.6 does anyone mind telling me what all the hate is about.</p>

            <p>Funny enough, I recently had the chance to see some U.S. military weapons in real life, and they were a little bit “stubbier” than I’d expect, though I’m not sure what exactly I might have been expecting.</p>

            <p>One thing that puts me off about CS:GO is the FP weapon models. I really don’t like them, at all. They look like stubby toys. But I like that they are changing CS up a bit. I stopped playing CS a while ago because I was tired of it, and CSO2 is gonna have to have something other than new maps if I’m gonna play it.</p>
<p>But the weapons do look way better from what I can tell</p>
<p>Other then that though, CS: GO seems better. And plus, I’m sure there will be some good weapon skins eventually so that makes it better, at least for me</p>

<p>Ok, I’m likely to be dead wrong about CS:GO (but it does release in 2013, after CS:O2).</p>
<p>It still looks like just an awesome texture pack. Have they changed any game mechanics? Do the maps have the exact same layout?</p>

<p>Guys, guys.</p>
<p>CS:GO is effectively in it’s alpha stages. It’s going through testing and lacks nearly any kind of polish.</p>
<p>It also appears that this “CS:O2” has changed little if any of the gameplay mechanics. As far as I can tell it’s an exellent texture pack.</p>

<p>I am not sure how long CSGO has been developed, like year? And CSO2’s being only made for 6 month and it is already look even better than CSGO for me.</p>
<p>I’ve kept my eyes on CSGO forum for awhile and user made alot of good suggest like “Remove tracer” “add character flinching upon hit”. And CSGO failed to achieve it before CSO2 did. And CSO2 is in beta stage too, it is gonna launch CBT in August for Korea user.</p>
