    <title>why does it move like that</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-does-it-move-like-that/13897</link>
    <description>30 minutes i spent in the options menu trying to make the gaem playable. And failed. i played space sim games wher the ship handles better than this guy. Why does it rock like a boat when you strafe? is he drunk? why does it have momentum when you move and stop  forward and backwards? Overall It feels like he weights 500 pounds.  Another great shooter that i am enjoying right now is borderlands 2.  time spent in the menus 0 seconds. this is unplayable</description>

            <p>If the movement speed bothers you that much you can get technical and customize your speed, acceleration, etc. in single player with console commands.</p>

            <p>As xeoxer said, disabling view bobbing will fix the view rocking from side to side. I love it personally, but it’s not for everyone.</p>
<p>As for the movement feel, our movement is pretty much stock Source.</p>

            <p>Oi, fuck it, I’ll bite the bait.</p>

<li>It was like that in the original, and seeing as this is a remake, well…</li>
<li>It’s call velocity. It’s a thing. All Source games have it.</li>
<li>Probably weighs closer to 250.</li>
<li>Congratulations.</li>
