    <title>The Science of Half-Life</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-science-of-half-life/6311</link>
    <description>Going against my better judgement, I&#39;ve decided to share a scientific article for discussion here. And I apologize in advance if the thread goes horribly awry, and I&#39;m sorry if it doesn&#39;t quite fit in this particular section of the forums, though it does have a Half-Life connection.

[url]https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110112132128.htm[/url]

I was perusing my usual sites today when I stumbled across this article and couldn&#39;t help but think of Half-Life.

According to the article, &quot;crystal can store information encoded into entangled quantum states of photons,&quot; and that &quot;Quantum networks will allow the sending of information [using photons].&quot;

So, be it a bit of stretch, I think this could be applied to teleportation theory.  If crystals can be used to store and send information via photons through space, what if they could be used to store and send bigger bits of information such as atomic data and mass, therein becoming a viable teleport via dematerializing?

It just strikes me as interesting considering the big teleportation medium in Half-Life is a special crystalline structure.  Perhaps using a crystal to teleport isn&#39;t so far-fetched.  Though I don&#39;t see the opening of portals to parallel dimensions/universes coming from this, perhaps there is the potential of sending matter through space.

Maybe those green-laser things were particle accelerators sending high-energy photons into the Xenian crystal to create a Quantum network via the Xen relay.  Thus allowing matter to be sent back and forth via dematerialization.  Perhaps the interactions of subatomic particles in the Xen borderworld with the Quantum network caused a temporal rip of some sort, causing the whole Black Mesa fiasco.  Anti-matter colliding with matter, or perhaps dark matter colliding with these Quantum network photons/particles?</description>

            <p>Athiest or not, you still dont want to not exist at any time. the way i see it, religious or not (partly religious here) if a you die and loose consciousnes, even if its for a split second, are you still going to be in control of your body at the other end? Its not the same body remember? so theres a decent chance a clone of you is running around the other side whilist the real you gets de-materialized and you dont exist anymore. just some lunatic on the other end who’s 100% sure hes the real you.</p>

            <p>To make it short:<br>
yes, quantum entanglement does exchange information faster than light.<br>
NO, it can’t be used to exchange information between people, thats not a matter of progress of development, it’s a matter of the laws of physics.<br>
Yes, quantum teleportation does create a exact copy at another place while destroying the original one.<br>
No, it can’t send you to places where nobody was before because of for every single bit of information, a photon has to be send there. So a crystal like this just acts as a memory, storing this information. So quantum teleportation is like measuring a system here, sending this information via photons, and recreating the system there from this information, but in a much more complicated way.</p>

            <p>I never doubted your google powers.</p>
<p>also from one of the comments:</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what the big deal is, with quantum entaglement like this; you could put a communication device in a ship, send it to anywhere in the universe and communicate instantly with it with no time delay.  As an example, right now to communicate with Mars, it takes 20 minutes for signals to transmit between planets.</p>

In the game portal… there were no dematerializing. Except their portals are different from what you guys are talking about… so I’ll shut up now.</p>

<p>My problem with teleportation theory is this: Say you are able to dematerialize, atom by atom in one location, and rematerialize in another with nothing out of place, is it still you? Would the information in your brain make it? Were you not, in effect, destroyed and recreated?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>From what I have read, the rematerialized version of yourself would be a perfect recreation, every single atom and molecule as it should be, including memories and personality.  The only issue is continuity of existence, which is a core factor in teleportation theory.  Even if the rematerialized version of yourself is perfect and continuous with your dematerialized self, you are still utterly destroyed in the teleport entrance as you’re dematerialized.  So, YOU no longer exist, but a perfect version of yourself with all thoughts and memories from where you left off is now living in your place.  Or something like that, it’s a thinker.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I do have to admit it’s pretty impressive how this is somewhat similar to the teleportation methods of Half-Life.  There have been many cases where sci-fi films like James Cameron’s “The Abyss”  have shown what at the time seemed like and imaginary technology, yet not too long afterward (for example, the liquid breathing in The Abyss,  if you haven’t seen it, see it).</p>
<p>So it doesn’t surprise me that we’re starting to get this from video games as well.  Hell, we might even start getting technology from the Halo games at some point which I think at least would be pretty cool.</p>
<p>Now we may not get portals exactly like in the Half-Life series where it’s required to be teleported in and out of a Border world, this is yet another example of how these sort of things can happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teleportation is already a known subject in the scientific community its just that scientists cant teleport anything larger than an atom as they are only able to teleport one atom at a time from one instance in space to another, but the only downside to it is that it trades places with another atom (how they know this i have no clue). If this is true then if they ever were able to teleport something bigger than an atom it would have to be an exact replica of said item having equal mass and possibly equal structure as the item you are teleporting</p>
<p>so in other words “teleportation” will never be fully understood anytime soon</p>

<p>The problem with dematerialization is you would lose all of your memories and or brain functions while dematerializing there for you would die once the brain ceases function, in this case “dematerialization”, if the “teleportation machine” were able to recreate your body back the way it was it would just be a corpse.</p>

<p>Why would it lose all memories and brain functions? If the connections are all there and there’s still the necessary chemicals present, it’ll resume functioning on the other side.</p>
