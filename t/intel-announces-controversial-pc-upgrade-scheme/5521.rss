Intel is giving buyers of some computers the  chance to pay for an upgrade that boosts the power of the processor in  their desktop PC.

        The pilot scheme will involve purchasing a card bearing a security key that unlocks the extra features via the web.



&quot;This saves the user from buying a new system or taking it in for a physical upgrade.&quot;

When I buy a piece of hardware, I want all of its potential available to me from the get go.


Hopefully this scheme will be just an option.</description>

            <p>I won’t buy one unless I am 100% sure I can unlock it’s true potential using leet hax of some sort right after I buy it.</p>
<p>I bet intel will have a scheme where the more advanced the upgrade the harder it is to hack, and have every CPU comes equipped with a built-in ethernet LAN adapter so that all hacked chips will be permanently bricked via the internet unless kept offline in some way.</p>

            <p>From my prospective this isn’t something that should be instantly feared.  It could lead to good things as both a consumer and Intel as a business.  It has the potential to lower the cost of CPUs.  Also its unlikely that it will be introduced and then standard processors will be cut right away.  Everyone here assumes that this will cause Intel to rase prices but I think it will do the opposite.</p>
<p>Giving computer illiterate consumers the ability to upgrade easily, would drive more upgrade sales.  This increase in sales could that they make more money on cheaper sales then on high priced sales.</p>
<p>Computers have been getting cheaper and cheaper over the years.  Innovations like these would have been controversial in the early days of computers early computers had internet.  Give it a chance, later on you may feel foolish for condemning a perfectly good business model, that would make the availability of computers cheaper and more wide spread.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  Atm the only flaw with this new scheme is how Intel will price it.  It has just as much potential to be an amazing innovation in computers as a horrid scheme to swindle uneducated buyers.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, they already do this with boat engines. Many boat companies build their boat engines with the same specs, then use a chip to lock it down to a certain level of horsepower. You just take it into the shop to upgrade it. So Intel is borrowing an already implemented idea.</p>

            <p>I’ve almost hit a wall with my system. My AMD 3800 x2+ is beginning to feel la little dated. It will do almost any normal thing I throw at it but sadly on the last movie we edited the team had to shoot in 720p because my system kept choking up with the 1080p stuff.</p>
<p>Think have about a year and a 1/2 left on this system before I get another (if I have the cash at that time)</p>

            <p>Is unlocking the fourth core considered legal and something anybody can do?</p>
<p>I’m just wondering because if its not then it wouldn’t be much different from people hacking into and overclocking these kinds of intel processors in the future</p>

            <p>That response was not a direct one about the topic at hand (please go back and read/re-read the posts preceding it). It was about the fact that Intel could gouge set the price of chips using this scheme because there would be no distinct intrinsic value of the chip. That was my rebuttal to that claim. Intel would not not set the price based on a processors cost but rather on a two things. The cost of R&amp;D and the more abstract fact of the market value per performance as  they are already doing today, and have been doing for many years.</p>
<p>Also @ russilker and Fungus<br>
there was a reason that was my third and weakest point.</p>

<p>True, but you shouldn’t have to go to the illegal way to get the most out of the hardware you bought. And I probably would, simply because I don’t really care if its legal or not and because I couldn’t stand using hardware that I KNOW is underclocked if there’s an easy way to fix that…</p>
<p>And for all you know, it won’t be cracked, like Steam (there’s no keygen out for it, and no real way to play on VAC Secured servers unless you own the game).</p>
<p>EDIT: Oops, realized I’m a page late, sorry</p>

            <p>Just thought I’d not the fact that nvidia have already done this, in a sense, as their ION LE is the same as their full ION, and can be hacked to use ION drivers, which produces the exact same specs.</p>

            <p>Reading the posts here, “selling” an overclock actually does make sense. You can already do it, with varied success and void of warranty.</p>
<p>If they offer an alternative with backed support and extended guarantee, it may actually be worth a little. All depends on the actual pricing and benefit.</p>

            <p>new technology that Intel had just rolled out/market testing.</p>
<p>You buy a processor (ideally at a reduced price) but it’s not running at full power. (reduced clock or disabled threads) You can then later purchase an “Upgrade” card that allows you unlock those restrictions.</p>

            <p>i dont understand this… this is like overclocking?<br>
if this is something else than overclocking the prosessor please someone tellme</p>

            <p>It costs intel $40 to make a chip.<br>
They sell it for $637.</p>
<p>That was in 2005 before this topic existed.</p>
<p>The price is not dependent of the cost of the processor, it is that of R&amp;D, the market demand, and that of competitive pricing. If people are willing to spend $930 on an i7 Extreme (A processor that I guarantee doesn’t cost much more than the regular i7 to produce) Intel will gladly sell it to you. Not saying thats right, but how is that ANY different than this new plan.</p>

<p>Yeah but with that attitude you will let anyone hike their prices up and you’d eat it right up.</p>

<p><span class="hashtag">#1</span> being better compatibility. Intel would be making less chips, and in turn less socket types. So they could have many of the same chip just running at varying speeds.</p>
<p>Secondly I would think upgrading the clock of your processor would be cheeper than Purchasing a new processor that runs at the higher clock rate. Sure the combined price of the chip and the upgrade may be more, but there is nothing stopping you from just doing that in the first place if you want the faster processor.</p>
<p>Third is (especially with many users here) the opportunity for free upgrades. They managed to find a flaw in the architecture of the cell, they have broken the locks on the tri core amd who says that with enough time and enough people, some one somewhere  find out how to remove the stops on these things.
