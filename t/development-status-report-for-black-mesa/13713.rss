    <title>Development Status Report For Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/development-status-report-for-black-mesa/13713</link>
    <description>So here we are two months into 2015, and BM has been GreenLit for quite sometime. As the new year unfolded, I was expecting/wanting some sort of overall status report as to the state of BM&#39;s development, but there&#39;s been nary a peep. I think the majority of long-time followers/supporters (and even noobies) of BM would like to be brought up to date as to a &quot;where are we now&quot; status report. Most of us are aware of the fiasco that resulted with your long-ago previous statements regarding the mod&#39;s initial release, and its repeated release delays. That&#39;s all fine and good, but all of that transpired quite a while ago.

As such, an up-to-date [u][b]general[/b][/u] statement as to &quot;this is where we&#39;re at&quot; would be VERY prudent and beneficial, in not only promoting, but more importantly, maintaining the longtime VERY positive hype surrounding BM. We&#39;re not expecting/looking for a release date, just a non-commital &quot;hey, this is what we&#39;ve recently improved/accomplished&quot; summary.

You&#39;ve had an extended and widespread raging bonfire burning concerning the [b]MASSIVE[/b] interest in BM - I think it would be very beneficial to toss a few logs onto the pyre, not only to maintain interest for long-term followers, but to attract newbies to the fold. If it&#39;s worded right, there&#39;s no harm in telling us &quot;this is where we are&quot;.

IT&#39;S BEEN QUITE A WHILE and a lot&#39;s happened   .   .   .   what&#39;s been going on ?   .   .   .   It&#39;s very simple   .   .   .   what&#39;s the BUZZ !</description>

<p>Sorry sir, but allow me to make one teeny tiny note here.  There was only ever ONE date given, therefore only ONE delay fiasco.</p>

            <p>It is a rule that we never give percentage estimates or a “big picture” overview of how we’re doing. There won’t be any exceptions until we announce a release date. Which may not be too horribly far in the future…[/size]</p>
<p>There has certainly not been “nary a peep”. We’ve been constantly updating on here and social media with those very things you were asking for, you just need to hunt around a little. There’s been some other fun stuff going on too, if you know where to look. Just yesterday I posted a huge list of things we’ve done to improve on the base game. There’ll be plenty more to come, when we’re ready. I’m our new “community manager” and I’m all for transparency and discussion - when we’re ready. That isn’t quite yet. You’ll get your BM updates, rest assured.</p>
