            <p>Okay… thanks for your suggestion.when Downloading Source SDK 2007, source SDK 2006 is also Downloaded if i let finish source SDK 2007 and pause SDK 2006 will it work still properly or source SDK 2007 and 2006 must be downloaded completely? It only asks for Source SDK 2007 and I want to delete or Pause the source SDK 2006 to save more space and i dont think BMS needs SDK 2006. Do I really need to download SDK 2006 100% ?</p>

            <p>You NEED Source sdk 2007 files. Though it might not be a problem in this case. Finish downloading source sdk files, validate them and then try again. IF that doesn’t help, redownload bm and try again.</p>
