    <title>Ladders and Jumping</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ladders-and-jumping/10440</link>
    <description>There&#39;s bound to be many threads of this. I&#39;m deleting my account after this too, or just never coming back so I don&#39;t care about your &quot;lets suck up to the admins&quot; replies.

The ladders are such a tedious process to use in this mod, I understand it&#39;s a mod blah blah blah. No. You&#39;ve had at least 8/9 years? to make this game and you couldn&#39;t fix the ladders in testing? I just tried to attempt the Tentacle part (which is piss easy) but with these ladders it&#39;s SO fucking impossible to do. The same with jumping, half the time Gordon doesn&#39;t make the complete jump becuase how high you jump in this game is bullshit. FYI: If you&#39;re trying to jump onto a crate, you have to crouch the moment after pressing jump.

Fuck this game.</description>

            <p>I actually had some situations where Gordon simply would not jump off the ladder.</p>

            <p>The ladders work exactly like they do in HL2 and the episodes, I had no problems with any of them.  Jump height is also the same.</p>

            <p>The ladders are easy to use. Press the USE key (E) near a ladder and you get on the ladder. Then when you’re ready to get off the ladder, press the USE key again.</p>

            <p>OH WOW, YOU SURE SHOWED ME. SHIT ASSASSIN, YOU MUST BE A REAL TROLL.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got past the Tentacle ages ago, just took more patience than I had prior anticipated. There’s not too much other things other than sometimes there’s this odd severe lag that I’ll get when starting up the game and I had one crash.</p>
