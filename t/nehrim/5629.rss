Total conversion Oblivion mod. Download it. Its awesome.







Not convinced? Well then, allow me to elaborate. Basically its a total conversion mod with an all new world (i.e. new lore, races, everything, no more tamriel). Its world space is the size of Oblivion, and hand detailed, meaning everything looks incredible, this coupled with improved graphics.
Gameplay is modified from Oblivion slightly but still the same slap with sword/spell/arrow until dead, with some new spells. Leveling up is changed to a mix of XP and skill increase mix, which works well. It does have that &quot;Oblivion was too easy must make supa hard&quot; mentality, and as such I had to put it on easy so I could just enjoy the scenery without being almost killed by Wolves every five feet.
Overall though I&#39;m loving it, the world is just so much more explorable than Oblivion&#39;s.

Also its in German but has English subtitles.</description>

            <p>I’ve beat Oblivion and the DLCs once and loved them, so I’ll have to check this out.  I’m guessing I’ll need a clean install with no mods activated, hm?</p>

            <p>Not sure, haven’t seen that quest. I’ve been screwing around way to much, barely started the main Quest. Have you looked for a walkthrough.</p>

            <p>Where the hell can you find that kidnapped woman in the quest that you get from that woman in the first parts of the game. Quest log says I have to look NW starting from the basket but no luck so far. I even searched the entire area around the city of Erothin but to no avail. Please help.</p>
