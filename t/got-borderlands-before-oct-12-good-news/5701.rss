<p>Well I have only played the demo for one previous duke nukem game, so I cant say anything comparing it to previous games.<br>
Its hilarious though. I absolutely loved it. Not much more I can say, I could explain everything that happened in the demo, but I have a headache and I’m sure a simple google search can lead you to many an article/blog detailing the whole demo.</p>

            <p>I was expecting a sale, Steam, I am dissapoint. (yeah, I know the point of the thread is the DNF demo available with purchase of Borderlands GOTY but fuck that, I’m not shelling out $50 for borderlands when I’ve already pre-ordered DNF from gamestop.)</p>

            <p>I was expecting the thread to say something like “Got Borderlands before Oct 12? LOL NEW PRICE CUT WITH ALL THE DLC PACKS” and then I was thinking “Good thing I’ve been holding out!”. And then I was sad.</p>

            <p>oh cool i get two exclusive wallpapers that i’m sure no one will publish publicly (same goes for the demo)</p>
<p>guess it’s just a cool way to get reminded when the demo comes out… at least it has some use</p>
<p>plus it’s not like i didn’t spend dozens of hours in borderlands anyway so that was money well spent and anything that comes out of it is even more awesome</p>
