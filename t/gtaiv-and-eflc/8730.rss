    <title>GTAIV and EFLC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gtaiv-and-eflc/8730</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been searching around and nothing has helped. I recently installed a SSD and installed Windows onto it. Steam is still on my HDD, though I moved it onto the root of the drive instead of in all the folders. I reinstalled Steam but just copied the steamapps folder into the new install. Most of the games still work, but GTAIV and EFLC refuse to. Every time I start it up, it shows the Rockstar Social Club window and no matter what I pick on there, nothing happens after that. I&#39;ve tried reinstalling but it doesn&#39;t work, and it doesn&#39;t do any first time setup like you usually have to do with Steam. I&#39;ve tried manually installing the stuff from the folder that comes with it but it complains about not having enough space, despite there being plenty of space.

I don&#39;t understand what the problem could be since it worked fine before I got the new SSD :S .

Edit: Well I don&#39;t know what the hell happened. I had tried running the .exe directly and it gave me an error that I didn&#39;t know what it was. I just tried it again though, and it said that xlive.dll was missing from my computer. I put the xliveless one in the folder and now it seems to be working :/ . I&#39;ll see if it stays this way.</description>

            <p>I’m fine with no online play, so that’s not a problem. But yeah, it’s weird how it just started working all of a sudden.</p>

            <p>It may continue working, but AFAIK multiplayer will not work with xliveless. I would’ve tried downloading GFWL manually and seeing if that fixed the problem.</p>
