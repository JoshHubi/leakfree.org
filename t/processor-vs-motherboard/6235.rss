    <title>Processor vs. Motherboard</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/processor-vs-motherboard/6235</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not really sure if this processor is compatible with my motherboard, so before I damage my computer, I was hoping someone could tell me if I can find out before I install it.

I have an Intel 2 Core Duo E7500.  My motherboard is a Dell 0WG855.

I&#39;m completely new to this, so I don&#39;t know what else is important.</description>

            <p>Nevermind.</p>
<p>The chipset is P965/G965…according to <a href="https://ark.intel.com/chipset.aspx?familyID=22212" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> it apparently isn’t compatible.</p>

            <p>Download it from <a href="http://Dell.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Dell.com</a> (there should be a section for drivers and software, make sure you get the one for your specific PC model). AFAIK you can update it through Windows, but if not you’d need to put it on removeable media and boot into it while starting up the computer.</p>
<p>That’s as specific as i can get without reading up on your PC, you should be able to figure it out. But try to pop in the new CPU if you already have it, maybe a BIOS update isn’t necessary</p>

            <p>Even if you put it in and it doesn’t work, nothing should be damaged. It just won’t POST.</p>
<p>Before you pop it in, though, upgrade the BIOS of the computer with the old CPU (if you still have it), and if you really want to make sure it’ll work, nothing wrong with calling Dell support. They should be able to tell you exactly.</p>
<p>EDIT: But yeah, it should work. From what I read online both incorporate the same socket type, LGA 775.</p>
