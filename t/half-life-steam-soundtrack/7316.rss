    <title>Half Life Steam soundtrack</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-steam-soundtrack/7316</link>
    <description>As you may or may not know, the audio quality of the music used in the Steam version of the original Half Life is rather crap-tastic. I&#39;ve seen threads &#39;round the inter-net discussing how to replace them with higher quality ones, but one thing didn&#39;t make sense. 

Those threads usually had a link to a .rar of the soundtrack, but what confused me was the fact that the soundtrack had more files than were actually in the Steam folder. It also seemed like when I tried to play it after copying the files, it still used lower quality music. Maybe I was looking in the wrong folder?

I could simply play the original CD version of the game, but the downside to that is the fact that it will not play in 1920x1080p in widescreen as the Steam version will.

Ideas?</description>

<p>I wasn’t asking where to find the soundtrack, dick. I was asking if anyone knows why the soundtrack (which I already have in 2 formats) has more tracks than there are files in the media folder. Ass.</p>

<p>You know being an asshole to him isn’t gonna’ make him go away. You could have just answered his question or said sorry I don’t know. But instead, arrogantly, you just made it harder on yourself by saying what you did and being a negative help to society, great job.</p>

            <p>I think the higher-quality music can be found in HLS, while the lower-quality music is in the steam version of HL1. The extra songs are other versions of Prospero_01, I don’t really know much else to say about that. Also, make sure you put the songs in \valve\media, &amp; that they have the right names &amp; .mp3 extension.</p>

            <p>Rip the songs from the CD version then copy/paste them in the steam folder.<br>
That should have been the most obvious answer.</p>
