    <title>The Military is an asshole in HL1</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-military-is-an-asshole-in-hl1/2105</link>
    <description>The fucking military AI on hard is hella hard. Quote From Soldier &quot;I killed 12 dumbass scientists and non of them fought back this sucks&quot;. Why the heck would the Military kill poor innocent scientists they didnt do anything wrong. Well one Scientist fought back: ME!!

 I dont know who is worse the aliens or the military. First time I played this game I was like &quot;what the hell Im no alien OUCH THAT FUCKING HURT!!&quot; My question is was the military there to cover the incident up,to kill the aliens, or kill the black ops. Oh the Black OPS are fucking annoying they&#39;re fast and aggressive like spiders. They Killed Black Mesa with a nuke as I know from Opposing Force.</description>

<p>What I don’t understand is why the assassins would be there to deal with him if you just end up walking into a room and getting jumped anyway. Seems like a lose-lose, y’know?</p>

Keep in mind there are some soldiers who questions the purpose of their mission.</p>

            <p>Give someone with a massive inferiority complex a gun, and they’ll more than likely kill scientist and aliens alike with little or no regard. But if I had to choose between the pointless near-fun slaughter of unarmed scientist vs. an alien grunt…I’d choose the former over the latter without hesitation lol.</p>

            <p>Srsbsns indeed. I don’t think there is some super secret reason why they are “assholes” back when the game was made it was kind of popular thing to consider the military out for blood, showing no mercy, etc. (And it still is for a few of the lower budget movies these days).</p>
<p>What I don’t understand is why the black ops are there? Maybe they were supposed to be from a “shadow” government branch or something.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that the black ops would be there to kill everyone and the USMC was there to rescue survivors and kill the aliens. The portrayal of the soldiers in the game are that they are all blood thirsty, I mean any real soldier would be “happy” enough with aliens run around, they wouldn’t give a fuck about scientists running around.</p>
