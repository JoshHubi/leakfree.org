    <description>When you jump while moving, &quot;inbound tram&quot; or &quot;on a rail&quot; you jump backwards.  Is this a limitation of the sdk or a bug?</description>

            <p>I only noticed it when the first rail cart slams into another one.  In the original I thought it launched you all the way across the room when you jump during the impact.</p>
<p>Could be remembering it wrong.</p>

            <p>If I recall correctly, jumping was like that in the original Half-Life, so it was probably done on purpose. I would be very interested to know for sure, though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I don’t mind it as an odd bit of nostalgia, but I have noticed it causing problems when moving vertically. I could be imagining this, but I <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> I remember jumping and falling through a lift at one point. Also, can anyone confirm if the same jumping behaviour applies to headcrabs?</p>

<p>You don’t jump backwards? You just jump up, and the train moves forward? So it looks like you’re going backwards.</p>

<p>Not that it’s physically correct.</p>

            <p>It was like that in the original game.<br>
My guess is its a bug in the original game.</p>
