    <title>Linux-based Media Center Options - Any ideas?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/linux-based-media-center-options-any-ideas/8061</link>
    <description>I was just wondering. I have a vast collection of TV shows and anime sitting pretty on a server. I am looking into setting up a PC dedicated to being a media server. What I would want to set up would be somewhat like a randomized list of the shows I have stored, which when the next show was selected, would play the next episode in that selection. A playlist of playlists, as it were. When an individual playlist would be selected (a playlist per show), a single episode would play, and then it would move on to the next playlist. From the vast array of Linux based options, is there any anyone would recommend?</description>
