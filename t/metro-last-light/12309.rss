    <description>the epic sequel of the story of russian metro tunnels filled with neo-fascists and communists and mutants that dwell on the surface due to nukes

Metro now returns with better graffix, better gameplay, and most importantly, immersion; and tits

it truly is a great game and i will not spoil anything besides backstory stuff

according to THQ, 4A had a real low budget when making this game, and were in horrible working conditions (a budget &quot;that AAA devs would&#39;ve consumed making a cutscene&quot;)

            <p>I don’t even know if the game is 64 bit. And I doubt the game uses much more than 2GB if it is. And I think lack of ram would cause stuttering and not really low frame rate.</p>

            <p>I suppose that the reason for the lack of performance at times is the amount of memory: 6Gb, which is not enough (in the specs of the game it says that 8Gb are required for the optimal performance).</p>

            <p>I think your CPU is the issue. The Metro games are actually properly multithreaded, so having 4+ cores would be best. Two cores is kind of pushing it. Having 6GB RAM should be fine.</p>
<p>Edit: And just checked, a dual core CPU at 2.2GHz is the minimum requirement, so your CPU is just above minimum.</p>

<p>I think it uses less than 2GB VRAM maxed out without ssaa. What are your specs? And besides the quality setting (which you said you maxed) what are your other settings (physx, ssaa, etc)?.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, I am not really max out with this game (which I just realized) - anisotropic filtering is at 4, and there is no SSAA (though the game looks perfect even without it), and I have non PhysX setting in. Also, my CPU is Pentium G620 (dual core, clokced at 2.60 Ghz, under i3 class CPU), and the speed of the system RAM is unknown to me. The video card is R7 260X. I realize that the game utilizes some GI algorithm, that is more CPU hungry than the “Metro 2033” game, so, I guess it at times needs a lot of system RAM (perhaps for Kd-Tree building, or such), which I do not have.</p>

            <p>Guys, how much video memory is required for the game to play on the max settings smoothly? I have 2Gb of it, and the game plays sometimes like a slide-show, other times with great fps, even in very complex scenes. Or it is an issue of lack of enough of system RAM, which I have 6Gb?</p>

<p>Also, it seems to be much heavier proportion wise on the CPU than the “Metro 2033”.</p>

<p>the only problem i have with this game is that they spend so much time making the game world immersive and they have the ranger difficulty to make you feel like you’re really scrounging for survival, but then all the voice acting is done in english with horrible cartoony russian/german accents and the voice acting itself is so over the top.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>IIRC, at least in the first game the English voice actors were the same as the Russian ones.</p>
<p>So, those Russian accents were real.</p>

            <p>im more interested in hearing secret dialogue in Russian</p>
<p>edit: nope mouse is still waaay faster horizontally than vertically</p>
<p>also what’s the deal with not letting me turn off antialiasing? It should at least disappear after I disable it in Catalyst.</p>
<p>My framebuffer is already too big for my GPU I don’t want to give up playability only to make the picture slightly blurrier.</p>

            <p>Heh, sorry, venting. I’ve posted about it on the Steam forums for the game and I guess they’re looking into it for another patch but it’s taking longer than I was hoping.</p>
<p>i5 760 @ 3.5GHz<br>
GTX 670<br>
8GB RAM</p>
<p>I’ve tried pretty much everything, using different driver versions, verifying game cache, reinstalling game, etc but no dice. It crashes in the exact same way every time too and the event log looks identical each time as well. Positive it’s an issue on their side.</p>
