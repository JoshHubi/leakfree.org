    <title>Half-Life 1 [WON] - No music in Win 7</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-1-won-no-music-in-win-7/4665</link>
    <description>Hi. I recently got urge to play HL1 again, so I dusted off my HL disc and installed the game. But the problem is that I can&#39;t hear music, even with CD in tray. I tried 1.1.1.0 update, but without luck (I prefer patch 1.1.0.4, it&#39;s less buggy). Do you have any experience with it? I suppose that it has something to do with Windows 7 and theirs new volume mechanism (you can only change volume of applications, not of sound sources like wave, cd or midi). Thanks in advance  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>On the other hand, I cant say for certain that I am hearing the music when I am supposed to. I have played HL several times over the last few years and cant recall the music kicking in. Does anyone know when the first “music” piece kicks in? I would like to test to make sure I am getting the music.</p>

<p>There is an intro music right at the begining or you can try to pick up the hazard suit, that’s where the techno/disco music will come in.</p>

            <p>Try checking your game file integrity (in properties).  Or maybe just delete the game and reinstall it (HL1 doesn’t take too long to reinstall).</p>

            <p>Hey! I just came across my first bug in HL1 on Steam! Whenever I shoot the M203 Grenade Launcher the game crashes and I get a “Fatal Error: sv_starsoundL volume 390” or something like that. I already googled it and didn’t get anything. Anybody know how to fix it? Or what it means?</p>

            <p>I agree that the WON version is the best. The blood splashing/repeating issue is due to something else though, it might be the high definition pack.</p>

            <p>I’ve had the Steam HL1 all along.  I recently bought a new computer with Windows 7.  Of course I had to download all my games again (at least the ones I wanted to play right away).  After doing the achievements for HL2 Episodes 1 &amp; 2, I too got the urge to play the good ol’ HL1.  The graphics were horrible.  I went into the game’s options and did everything, but stand on my head, to get it right.  From there I went to Steam Support, they suggested to do an “autoconfig” now it’s as good as new.  Steam’s Support is really good.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I mailed Valve maybe 2 years ago if they have any plans of updating original Half-Life and getting rid of these bugs. They responded that they actually have no plans. So even Valve know that there are bugs in Steam version  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>

            <p>The steam version has bugs? I just bought HL on steam and haven’t noticed a difference at all. I’d recommend just putting it on Steam and do a test again. If younotice any bugs, if you have the CD just re-install it and don’t add it to steam and play.</p>

            <p>Saw the video, I know what you mean. Another thing is that yellow HUD - should be blue, that’s why I use WON version of Blue-Shift. You can also use Blue-Shift: Unlocked, mod for HL that can be played through Steam and corrects most of the bugs.</p>

            <p>The most annoying thing to me in the steam version is, that NPCs on moving platforms start jerking. This problem existed in the first version of Half-Life, but was fixed later with a patch. Strangely in the Steam version, this bug is existent again:<br>
Watch the scientists in that elevator: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGAjbpEIg_s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGAjbpEIg_s</a></p>
<p>I really don’t know, why the Steam verison has so many bugs (even bugs, that were fixed in the past).</p>
<p>But I would recommend using the Steam version anyway!</p>

<ul>
<li>No, it’s not fixed, I tried it few days ago and it was still there (I have Half-Life Anthology)</li>
<li>Actually, downgrading WILL fix it, my eyes are my witnesses</li>
<li>Crowbar will not move (did you see the youtube video?)</li>

<p>I just may create video comparison as a proof within the following days…</p>

</aside>
<p>What? Corpses or the crowbar? The corpses won’t move because HL isn’t running on the source engine, only HL: Source runs</p>
<p>splashing? Oh for fucks sake, Half life is a such a fucking good game and you whine over things like blood splashing everywhere</p>

            <p>I’m surprised that you didn’t encountered some of the annoying bugs, which are present in new versions of HL (mainly 1.1.1.0 - same update is in the steam version).</p>
<p>First the most annoying bug of all - elevator death. When you take a lift or elevator, you get occasionly stuck and are slowly dying. This happens especially when you are riding elevator and Loading pops up.</p>
<p>Second - weird animation of some weapons and scientists. Check glock, the first weapon; when Gordon takes a look at the gun, animation repeats in wrong way. Same thing applies to bee gun (I can’t remember it’s true name). Just hold the fire button when you are out of ammo.</p>
<p>Third - try to smash corpses with crowbar. It will not move, but blood splashing will be repeating itself very fast.</p>
<p>This video shows it quite nicely (wait for 0:52): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbY1lSPj4KU" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbY1lSPj4KU</a></p>
<p>But up to version 1.1.0.6 none of these problems are present in HL.</p>

            <p>Let him use what ever version he wants. Personally I prefer the WON version, but I don’t have the disk anymore so I have to use the Steam version. I mean, We may insist on using the steam version. but come on. Ultimately it’s not our choice it’s his. Thats like telling a person to drive a car 5 minutes because it’s faster.</p>

            <p>Actually, he is right about Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Both have major game breaking bugs that can only be avoidable through careful cheat manipulation.</p>
<p>Half-Life 1, though, is totally bug free.</p>

            <p>What is better? Anti-aliasing and tons of bugs or aliasing and almost none of the bugs? Resolution won’t make the game more fun, but absence of bugs will. Steam version is afwul and with terrible support of Opposing Force and even worse support of Blue-Shift are WON versions my only choice.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Won steam has shitty resolution options, and AA only via the video card control panel. Seriously, use steam.</p>

            <p>Thanks for tips… But I figured it out eventually, problem was that I didn’t used the first CD drive, but the second. Now I can enjoy the game with music  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . Maybe this will help someone in future.</p>
