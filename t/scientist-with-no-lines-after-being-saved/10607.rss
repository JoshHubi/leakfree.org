    <title>Scientist with no lines after being saved</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/scientist-with-no-lines-after-being-saved/10607</link>
    <description>The scientist at the start of office complex behind the red doors... If you kill the barnacle before it eats the scientist (easy to do if you go straight for the vent), the scientist has no lines.

This is similar to the guard at the start of Residue Processing

            <p>is the guy who submitted a bug report because the game was “too hard” really criticizing the choice to report this as a bug?</p>

            <p>Ideally he’d say thanks, but short of that, there’s really no reason he can’t have the same “yes I’ll follow you” and “I’ll wait here” lines that every other generic scientist has. That’s a bug in my eyes.</p>

            <p>I don’t really see how this is a bug. There are really limited lines, and even more limited voice actors for this game. If someone is saved, they normally don’t have anything to say. I wouldn’t consider this a bug, in that the only difference here is that he doesn’t repeat the same roulette of answers anyone else does if you bug him enough times.</p>
