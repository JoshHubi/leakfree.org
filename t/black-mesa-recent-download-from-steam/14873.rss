    <title>Black Mesa recent download from Steam</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-recent-download-from-steam/14873</link>
    <description>I bought BM right after it was offered for sale on Steam. I had downloaded the mod when it first came out as well after waiting patiently for quite a while. The original mod was great, the paid version was better but..... I recently had to reinstall Steam and all my games including BM. I just played it again from the beginning and I just have to say I am impressed with all the new improvements to even the original &quot;for sale&quot; version.  The graphics are better, the voice acting is better and just overall a huge improvement over the game that was on my machine. I can&#39;t wait for the Zen portion to be finished. I just had to post and tell the developers what a great job they have done. Bravo Zulu.</description>

The original mod was great, the paid version was better but… I recently had to reinstall Steam and all my games including BM. I just played it again from the beginning and I just have to say I am impressed with all the new improvements to even the original “for sale” version.  The graphics are better, the voice acting is better and just overall a huge improvement over the game that was on my machine. I can’t wait for the Zen portion to be finished.
