    <title>Yeah, so I&#39;m still having DVD drive trouble</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/yeah-so-im-still-having-dvd-drive-trouble/1203</link>
    <description>The motor on my last DVD drive failed, as most of you know.  I got a new one a while ago, and had to put up with some crazy antics on its part, but now I&#39;m fed up and come to you for aid.

Sometimes the DVD drive just won&#39;t work.  It&#39;s like it has lost power.  The light doesn&#39;t flash and the door doesn&#39;t open.  If I put the computer to sleep and wake it up again, the DVD drive&#39;s light usually starts flashing in a rhythmic pattern that won;t stop.  When this happens, it still won&#39;t open or read anything in there.  It&#39;s not even listed in the device menu.  It&#39;s like it&#39;s not there.  I need to physically restart the computer for it to work again.

When I do restart, the drive is fine.  It works great and everything.  But this usually goes down the shitter when I decide to put the computer to sleep.  When it wakes up, the DVD drive revs up, I log on, and I am promptly struck inthe face with a blue screen of death, which never occurred on my system before I put the DVD drive in, if you must know.

After the computer restarts, the drive is completely powered down, or the light flashes and it doesn&#39;t work.  Either way, the process starts all over.

I don&#39;t know the model number, as I threw out the box and lost the receipt.  However, I do know it&#39;s an LG.</description>

            <p>This is probably not the solution, but check if it’s plugged fully into your powersource. I had a problem where it wouldn’t open and I realized I’d unplugged it while installing my new processor  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> .</p>

            <p>It must be the sleep that throws it off.  The computer must tell it to shut off, but it won’t turn back on.</p>
<p>I’ve tweaked around with the power saving options so the hard drive turns off after 2 hours, along with a few other energy saving tricks.  Hopefully I’ll get the benefit of the computer going to sleep without it actually going to sleep.</p>

            <p>hal.dll is one of the first files to load when you start booting, that could mean at least 1 million different possible problems…</p>
<p>As for the DVD drive, if it’s IDE you most probably need new cables, if it’s sata, you might have to replace the drive itself.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s the chipset not being compatible with the drive, it has happened to me before.</p>
