    <title>A problem in Episode one...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-problem-in-episode-one/4302</link>
    <description>I first ran half life 2 episode one after having finished half life 2 on the OB engine. I started up episode one today only to find a Q as my crosshair, I have verifyed my cache files,  if anyone has had this problem with the new port of episode one and has a solution I would greatly appreciate it.</description>
