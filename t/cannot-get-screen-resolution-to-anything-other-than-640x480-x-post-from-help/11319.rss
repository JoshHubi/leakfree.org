    <title>Cannot get screen resolution to anything other than 640x480 (x-post from Help!)</title>

    <description>Not sure if Help! or In-Game Issues is the right area for this, so I&#39;m posting here as well:

I just installed Black Mesa, launched via Steam &amp; downloaded the Source SDK component. When I fire up BM, it works, but the screen is in 640x480, and the video options don&#39;t show anything else in the dropdown (selecting 16x9 gives me 854x480, but that&#39;s it).

I tried providing command line args to the app by right-clicking on the Steam entry and providing &quot;-w 1280 -h 720&quot; in the Launch Properties dialog, but this doesn&#39;t work either - still low rez, still no choices in the dropdown.

My setup is a Intel Q6600 w/Asus P5K-E motherboard, Radeon HD 4870, and the monitor is a Panasonic 720P projector (PT-AX100U), connected with an HDMI cable.

Any ideas where I can get the Source engine to realize I have a higher-rez monitor?</description>
