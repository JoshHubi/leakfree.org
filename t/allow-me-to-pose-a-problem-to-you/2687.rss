    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/allow-me-to-pose-a-problem-to-you/2687</link>
    <description>Say I want to create a new weapon, but only have it be comprised of existing meshes and animations, yet exist as its own weapon? What I want is to have the .357 use the crowbar animations, use the .357 weapon select picture (But be placed in the melee slot), and be gripped by the barrel. So basically, no messing with new models or animations, I just want to change it so the player grips the .357 model (rotated so its by the barrel) instead of the crowbar. This seems fairly simple, and I was really hoping it could be done.  

Basically, if you were wondering, the player comes across a gun that is empty, and uses it as a melee weapon/bashing tool instead of merely tossing it aside.</description>

<p>Yes, I did. But I can totally live with what I get. I am asking rather a lot for giving nothing back, as it is.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Either way works, technically, but most people I feel would smack things with the sturdier butt of the gun rather than the barrel. Plus, I feel that the trigger guard would get in the way and be painful on your hand if you were to whack things? And you definitely don’t want your finger on the trigger… I don’t know. Regardless. Is that gmod pic using the file that cman put up?</p>
<p>[EDIT: Okay, yeah, I’m gonna need my hand held for this process. I know it mus be annoying, but this is all hopelessly confusing for me. I’ve been perusing every folder in steam, and I simply can’t find where all the content of the game is actually <span class="bbcode-i">stored</span>. People keep telling me I need to edit so and so text file, and put things in certain folders, but to be honest, I can’t find any of these files. The only things in my Ep2 folder are all the files pertaining to my level, AKA a bunch of map-related files, a particle system file, and so on. But I don’t know how exactly to go about making my level its own entity so I can freely add new content to it and edit it. I want to add new sounds, and this crowbar replacement but I just don’t know how.]</p>

<p>You’re going to need to download GCFScape to access all the content files of Steam games:<br>

<p>And I could the imagine that the reason that the model isn’t holding the gun by the barrel is because the right side of the revolver, which would be facing the player if he was holding it by the barrel, is nonexistant.</p>

            <p>Just a question: can I put this in the regular HL2 as well to try it out for myself? I went into “hl2\models” but there’s only a “ShaderTest” folder. Is this because hl2 uses gcf instead of traditional folder trees? Ok so I have no idea what I’m talking about, just to let you know.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT: I figured out how to put it in SMOD.<br>
EDIT 2: Never mind, it didn’t work, there’s just nothing at all when I switch to the crowbar.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>I believe it already does, he wanted to keep the icon the same, but put it into the Melee category instead.</p>
<p>Unless I misread, but I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Also if you want to be neat about this, then I believe that you can put them in a folder inside …\weapons, although I’m not sure if this requires some other adjustments aswell. Probably won’t, but might aswell tell you.</p>

<p>Well, it’s a crowbar replacement, so he has to change the icon on crowbar slot to the .357 icon  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And there would be no real point in placing it in another folder than weapons, since it’s just a crowbar replacement.</p>

            <p>What? No, I wanted it to have the .357 logo. Why would I want it to have a crowbar logo? Anyways, thanks, I’ll fiddle around with this after work.</p>

            <p>Okay, so I took a look, and VS is 3 gigs to download. I just don’t have the internet connection to do that (really shitty DSL, i get like 30 kb/s to download). But this will only be until I get back to school next week, where my internet will hopefully improve. I was wondering if someone who already has the tools required could possibly do this thing for me, while I continue to work on the map itself? I don’t really have the skills or software required to do all that. I’m just a mapper. If possible, I will be looking into forming a small team soon anyway, seeing as I definitely want this to be a small mod. Let me know what you think of this proposal. If anyone needs something from me in order to do this (barring sexual favors, sorry! :3 ), then I will gladly oblige.</p>

<p>Well, what I’m thinking is, that it would sorta just be a remodel of the crowbar. Like that cowbar someone made they just stuck a model of a cowbar in place of the crowbar.

            <p>Is there a tutorial I can follow for this sort of thing (other mods have custom weapons, they must have learned somehow too), so i don’t have to go rushing into this thing blind and potentially wrecking the game? haha</p>
