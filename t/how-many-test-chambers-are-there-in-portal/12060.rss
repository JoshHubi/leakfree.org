            <p>Because the game’s two years old. And I’m an asshole.</p>
<p>But I’ve cut all the stuff out.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I just got the weirdest sense of Deja Vu here. How does the same dumb thread happen multiple times?</p>

            <p>Why did you go on to spoil half of the second game?</p>
<p>And wasn’t there this <span class="bbcode-i">exact same thread</span> a few months ago?</p>

            <p>When I’m done explaining the amount of test chambers in Portal series, you’ll think your pilot’s license has been revoked with a Gravity Gun, held by a Heavy wielding an ice bow, while being covered by an AWP.</p>
<p>There. I think that sentence made a reference to every major Valve game. I’m a a badass.</p>
<p>To the topic.</p>
<p>Total, in singleplayer for both games, I count around a hundred chambers, including counting certain portions as chambers.</p>
<p>In coop, there’s about 60 chambers, give or take five.</p>
<p>Solved it for ya.</p>
<p>P.S.: I didn’t play Portal for about two months now (way too long, hehe), so it might not be entirely spot on.</p>

            <p>Nineteen, but you’ve made a pretty silly mistake. “The Test Chamber” subforum is for usermade content  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
This should be in “Technology &amp; Gaming”.<br>
EDIT: Or “Half-Life Series”</p>
