    <title>External Hard Drive detection problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/external-hard-drive-detection-problem/12220</link>
    <description>So, it seems that my external HD works flawlessly with every computer I plugged it on save for one: My own PC

At other places, all I had to do is to plug the HD in and it&#39;ll get detected and I can use it normally.

However, I have to connect-disconnect it for a random amount of time in order for it to be detected on my PC. There is still the sound effect of connecting a USB device to my. When it doesn&#39;t work, the HD beeps on and on until it&#39;s disconnected.

So in regard of this weird phenomenon, I call upon thy help oh intelligent people of the Black Mesa forums, for without thy help I will be suffering in this dire situation.


tl;dr External Hard Disk won&#39;t be detected normally on my PC, but it works normally on every other PC so far. Help</description>
