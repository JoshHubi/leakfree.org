    <title>Half-Life 3 only co-op?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-3-only-co-op/7522</link>
    <description>I was just reading &quot;the final hours of Portal 2&quot; and one passage caught my attention:
[quote]
Today the industry is abuzz about Facebook games and mobile games on devices like the iPad. Valve has neither. But online gameplay, like the co-operative campaign in Portal 2, will surely be important in the future. [i][b]In fact, Portal 2 will probably be Valve&#39;s last game with an isolated single-player experience.[/b][/i] What this all means is something Newell is still trying to figure out, but he knows Valve needs to continually innovate by placing both short- and long-term bets.
[/quote]
I wonder what this means for Half-Life 3. I can&#39;t really imagine it without a single player campaign... Although co-op would be great fun too for sure!</description>

            <p>I know, I’m just giving my opinion on why it <span class="bbcode-i">shouldn’t</span> be co-op. Like I said, I don’t know what they’re gonna do with it, I just hope it won’t be that. They technically said '<span class="bbcode-i">isolated single player experience’</span> which I’m guessing means you’re never going to be by yourself, but that might just mean you’ll have npcs following you around. I don’t know, it’s just my 2 cents.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m just losing patience with Valve when now they’re announcing games that are just kinda, “Meh”.</p>
<p>I know there was a Gordon model in HL, but that’s a little different than having a model of him for a co-op game. Half-Life is not Left 4 Dead, I enjoyed the variety in their game types.</p>
<p>Half-Life was their ‘main’ series of a single player experience.</p>
<p>TF2, CS, DoD and HL: DM were their different varieties of MP games.</p>
<p>Portal series is their more puzzle-centric series with user created maps.</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead was the team based zombie shooter that actually had a story.</p>
<p>And even DOTA 2 could establish a new RTS series for them potentially, not necessarily under the same name.</p>
<p>But making HL co-op is just kinda like taking away the portal gun in Portal, especially if you’re playing as Freeman. (Decay does NOT count)  He was never meant to be just another character for you and your buddies to play as while you fought the Combine, you were supposed to BE him. If you were playing as random rebels through a story, that might work, but it wouldn’t be a proper sequel to Gordon’s story.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Valves gonna do with HL3, but I seriously hope it’s not a co-op like L4D. I don’t know what their deal is with the single player ‘forever alone’ type now anyway. It’s worked well so far.</p>

            <p>You do know that HL1 had a Gordon model, right?  He had a ponytail.  Obviously, GMan is a ninja barber.<br>
(though I’d agree about HL3 being coop.  Maybe if they did something like Portal 2 where you play as a couple rebels, but not with Gordon as one of the coop characters.)</p>

            <p>They could just have him, you know, remain silent. Just make the model. What would REALLY be cool is if they got Ross Scott to play Freeman’s voice. That would be awesome.</p>

<p>Gearbox made a coop Half-Life campaign.  Valve has said that most of the Gearbox stuff isn’t canon*.  And one of the characters, while not technically in the game, we had already seen.</p>
<p>*I know OP4 isn’t, have they said anything about Blue Shift or Decay?<br>
(1/3 = most?  I’m judging by content, and OP4 has much more than BS or Decay.)</p>

</aside>
<p>Apparently the only thing canon about OP4 was Black Mesa getting nuked. Which pisses me off but whatever.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m assuming BS and Decay are canon. At least BS. But that begs the question why the hell they would make and endorse these games if they were just gonna go back and say, "Oh yeah that didn’t happen.’ Or, ‘Only THIS happened, but nothing else.’ Seriously, that REALLY fucking pisses me off.</p>

<p>They could probably even bring those characters back alongside Gordon and make a COOP campaign that is a little like Left 4 Dead and have Barney be the fourth character…</p>

<p>I agree, videogames have discriminated against menopausal protagonists for far too long. It’s about time to change that by bringing Gina back 28 years after the incident.</p>

<p>Sorry to correct you, but not everyone plays the same games I do  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  Which, as you probably realize, means that I may not be able to play co-op even though I do have friends! I hope you understand, and in the future, you will also maybe realize that even people who don’t play games all day can be your friends! They’re quite nice people actually, some of them are even quite smart!</p>

            <p>Gearbox made a coop Half-Life campaign.  Valve has said that most of the Gearbox stuff isn’t canon*.  And one of the characters, while not technically in the game, we had already seen.</p>
<p>*I know OP4 isn’t, have they said anything about Blue Shift or Decay?<br>
(1/3 = most?  I’m judging by content, and OP4 has much more than BS or Decay.)</p>

            <p>People are seeming to forget they made a COOP Half-Life campaign before… it was called Half-Life: Decay and it featured a couple of new characters wearing HEV suits who where tied into the plot of Half-Life. They could probably even bring those characters back alongside Gordon and make a COOP campaign that is a little like Left 4 Dead and have Barney be the fourth character… or just make it a two player COOP game and choose a second character. They don’t necessarily have to make Alyx a player character. You could easily have a knee jerk retort saying they’d never do that but you never know.</p>
<p>Anyway there’s nothing wrong with totally single player experiences and it’s not just “forever alone” types who like them. I find that label pretty insulting anyway especially how freely it gets thrown around… much like other derogatory labels.</p>

            <p>They joked about 18 years between HL2 and HL3, though.</p>
<p>Which seems quite possible at this point.</p>
