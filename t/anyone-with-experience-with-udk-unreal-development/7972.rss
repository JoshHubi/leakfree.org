    <title>Anyone with experience with UDK (Unreal Development)?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anyone-with-experience-with-udk-unreal-development/7972</link>
    <description>I&#39;m doing an architectural visualization project with UDK, and I want to import a Sketchup model (which was already finished and textured) into UDK.  Some sources told me to export to the FBX format, where I used UDK&#39;s content browser to import the file.  However after importing the model is untextured and uncollidable, meaning it&#39;s covered in the default blue/white checkerboard, and I fall straight through it when testing.  Any ideas how I can fix this?  And what is the correct method to import models and textures?  (The Sketchup file is not a prop, but the entire house, including ground).

And if no one here knows UDK, feel free to delete this.</description>

            <p>Actually yes, I’ve used UDK before, and have made a map.</p>
<p>Not the greatest map evar.</p>
<p>But a map nonetheless.</p>

<p>That’s for FBX - for our own game project we use ASE. Plenty of documentation on that site, it’s horribly organized though so I suggest you use the search function to find any stuff you need to learn.</p>
