    <title>Bonzai Bounce, my first Iphone game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bonzai-bounce-my-first-iphone-game/4649</link>
    <description>Me and 2 friends finally finished our first iPhone and iPod touch game!
The game is called bonzai bounce and is a simple ball game with styleized graphics, i was responsible for creating and painting all the graphics while my friends worked on the technical aspecs of the game.

The game atm only works on the Iphone 3GS and Ipod Touch because of time and technical limitations but we are working on a patch to make it less heavy for older platforms.

            <p>depends on how you see it, if you compress all the time spent on the actual game, maybe two months or so, we had to learn everything from scratch when it came to the engine, and all that, but it took about a year from concept to finished idea, because we had school and other things to take care of meanwhile, so it has been an on/off projekt</p>
