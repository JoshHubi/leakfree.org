    <title>Quick Question About Object Fade in Distance</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/quick-question-about-object-fade-in-distance/11222</link>
    <description>Hi all! I have just started playing Black Mesa and to say I am impressed would be an understatement. The devs have done an incredible job so far (I&#39;m only about 2 hours into it).

I have a quick question that I imagine is handled by the source engine itself rather than this particular game: object fade in distance. Is there any way to increase it? What I mean is, when I am about 30 feet away from a barrel, it is invisible, then when I move a little closer it materializes. Is there any way to increase the minimum &quot;pop in distance&quot; to, say, 100 feet or more? I am playing the game maxed out already and don&#39;t see any option for this in the graphics menu.

Thanks in advance. :freeman:

P.S. My apologies for the vague title. I should have called it [i]&quot;Quick Question About Object Fade in Distance&quot;[/i] for clarity.</description>

            <p>Try using these console commands:<br>
r_screenfademaxsize<br>
r_screenfademinsize</p>
<p>Larger values increase maximum visible distance, if you’re between min and max the objects will be partially faded. Use with caution.</p>
