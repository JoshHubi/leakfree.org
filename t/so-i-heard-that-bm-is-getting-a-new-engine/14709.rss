    <description>So  BM is getting a better engine so that it&#39;s Xen World would be much better. [url]https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3201361[/url]

Would that mean rewriting most of the codes for the game?

If so, I think it would be nice if the M4 would be reworked in game as the automatic weapon of the HECU, and the MP5 as the BM Security Weapons, after all wouldn&#39;t it make sense? The BM development team kind of changed the aspects of weapons to fit their vision of the game, like now the MP5 has 30 rounds instead of 50, and has 150 rounds spare, etc. there are changes to make the game more realistic.

That doesn&#39;t mean that we should go realistic all the way, like making it magazine-based, projectile based bullets that are affected by gravity like Battlefield, etc. But rather it would be nice that the Devs would extend their plans a bit to include M4 within BM.

I think they could fit the M4 here. So, what if the MP5 has 30 + 120 rounds, that is the standard weapon of the BMS at later games, but the HECU has the M4 instead with 30 + 60 of rounds? I mean after all, it would have been even more realistic that soldiers use AR-15, as well as the M203 would be best fit to the M4.

With the upcoming Xen, and some parts of Black Mesa, there would have been wide-open areas that the MP5 would do so poorly. The M4 assuming even tighter spread, higher recoil, and lower rate of fire and if coupled with two-round bursts, it would have great effectiveness at long-range, tougher enemies that the MP5 would less ideal to tackle with. And with less ammo, it would be a niche role too that doesn&#39;t rob MP5 the spotlight of being go-to weapon for most cases. After all, that less ROF would make the M4 less ideal to deal at closer ranges.</description>

            <p>If you think donations could match up to what a retail product can offer, that’s insane and unrealistic. Could never happen. Why do you think serious businesses don’t use that model? We wouldn’t have even be able to cover 25% of the cost of the engine license. It’s been proven time and time again that a donation model for mods, simply doesn’t work. It might be sustainable for a small time, but if you want to work as a serious business delivering a professional product, you won’t ever beat going retail. That was a large part of our decision to go retail, and it’s paid absolute dividends. I know that my possible life (working full time on BMS) would be absolutely impossible if we’d chosen any other path. I ain’t rich, but I get by working on something I really love and care about. If you want to revile us for wanting that, feel free. Pretty much everything you see today would not have happened without that pivotal decision. It was a divisive one, even among the team, but ultimately the right one without a doubt.</p>
<p>My ST Uncut (I made both, by the way) available on ModDB is in no way comparable to what’s in retail. One is a “modder’s first maps” and another is a professional set of fully realised, fleshed out, detailed and (in my humble opinion) brilliant works. Not only did my abilities improve a ridiculous amount since the mod, the input and work of the team of course makes the biggest difference of all.</p>
<p>And regarding the Source 2013 SDK, it’s actually substantially less fully featured than what’s for offer in retail 2009/TF2. Stripped back in a significant number of ways. That’s why it’s freely available, and 2009/TF2 are only available to licensees. And our hybrid engine is looking more and more attractive by the day, in my opinion…</p>

</aside>
<p>Why is it only fair that the devs give everyone something they’ve poured years into for free? They don’t <span class="bbcode-i">owe</span> us a free game.</p>
<p>Now, I would say the devs owe Xen to those who bought early access (and I have every confidence in them. They’ve earned my trust.), but that’s because we paid them for the promise of more content. I know that, what, 2-3 years ago they planned for the game to be free? But things change.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em> How about you upgrade the mod version so I can get a stutter-free version of the game without paying A little over $10 just to stay updated? The mod version that runs on Source SDK 2007 only plays stutter free if affinity is set to only one CPU core, and not only that the MSS32.dll is from 1994, which has a crap ton of bugs and is partially responsible for the stuttery gameplay. I cannot invest money into Black Mesa Retail as a poor university student.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s my loss, yeah, whatever. I would rather promote equality by also updating the free mod version instead of leaving it as a buggy “legacy” that it is. Maybe, just maybe if I could coax my parents into buying me some Steam Wallet money, then I would stop my ranting and raving.</p>

            <p>Also I’d like to point out that the thread you linked is from 3 years ago and has no developers posting in it.<br>
It’s a load of speculation based on heavily outdated information.</p>
<p>As for the M4, I have no doubt that if someone hasn’t made a workshop replacement for the Mp5, they will.</p>

            <p>It’s too late to add a new weapon. Besides, it’s not just adding the weapon assets and code, they’d need to go and rebalance all the levels, enemy placement and what have you to make the new gun fit. It’s just not worth the effort for a machine gun that only ups the damage a bit.</p>
