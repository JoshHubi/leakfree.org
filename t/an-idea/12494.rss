    <description>I&#39;m not sure if this is the right section to post this in. But I have an idea for those experienced in coding or even the Black Mesa developers themselves. It is a simple idea. Fix/ recreate the Half Life 2 Beta along with the old story into a proper playable game. The old story looked like it had the potential to be quite unique and interesting and possibly longer than the original half life 2. It is a project potentially more ambitious than Black Mesa itself due too it not just being a simple remake of a game that has been out for years but a remake/fix of a game that never made it into retail. I have seen videos of the beta and always imagined that world but filled with life and working mechanics. I mean the base and the story are already there. What would be most important is to modify it and trim it so it is fun. As the one of the main reasons it was scrapped was due to certain sections not being considered fun by Valve. I highly doubt this is ever going to happen but I would like to see you people&#39;s thoughts on it.</description>

<p>The mod is called Dark Interval like you would’ve guessed and yeah, just browse through their gallery at Moddb toget an idea of their work, I think they’re a small team though so its going to be a long time until the release, but I do believe they’re the closest to a final product.</p>

<p>I took a look and it looks good. I posted a comment urging them on. They do indeed seem quite close with the basics. You know already completed most of the Air Exchange.</p>

<p>There’s already mods working in that, if you’re experienced with modding you should consider working with the Dark Interval team, since they’re probably the closest to the remake of the original Hl2 storyline.</p>

<p>Really? What are they called? How good would you say they are?</p>

I have seen videos of the beta and always imagined that world but filled with life and working mechanics. I mean the base and the story are already there. What would be most important is to modify it and trim it so it is fun. As the one of the main reasons it was scrapped was due to certain sections not being considered fun by Valve. I highly doubt this is ever going to happen but I would like to see you people’s thoughts on it.</p>
