    <title>Half Life 2/Gmod</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-2-gmod/1059</link>
    <description>Any help is appreciated. - As a last note im very new to all this and tbh.. the best i&#39;ve done is do a few expression 2 codes in garrys mod.

(UA) Destruction Theory (In-Game Name/Steam Name)



EDIT: Also how do i make custom textures =] (I have the better part of the summer to work on all this, anyone who helps me won&#39;t be wasting their time lol)

Edit2: Ok i&#39;ve found ways around lots of that stuff, however is there anyway to use vector thrust in hammer? instead of making the model and the entity i&#39;ve decided to just make it all in hammer and then vector thrust it to my target, however i&#39;ve searched and can&#39;t find anyway of doing this</description>

            <p>Ok, my only problem now is actually compiling the model. I use milkshape to model (I’m ok-ish with it), but… with cannonfodders model compiler it comes up with some sort of library .dll error… searching it up the cause seems to be vista (it just had to be XD) and… unless i can fix it im sort of stuck, but thanks for all your help, that seems like a good idea, the track means i can make the missile fly almost cinematically</p>
<p>Edit: Maps fine, restarted my pc and compiled and it was fine…</p>

            <p>I use that for elevators. Maybe that’s why I always die going down. Or I am just shit at designing non-lethal elevators. :retard:</p>

            <p>That’s better :3</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">If both the missile origin and target are stationary</span> I recommend parenting the missile model (which must be a prop_dynamic) to a <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Func_tanktrain" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">func_tanktrain</a> entity and have it follow a route of <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Path_track" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">path_track</a> entities to its destination.</p>
<p>Then pretty much the rest is just basic trigger usage, when the missile reaches a trigger brush you can trigger explosions and sounds and such.</p>

<p>Looking back at my post… i can see your point on it being in-specific. I would like to create a missile that will fly across a map to a target and then explode (obviously).<br>
I’d like this to be on a trigger also. My only ideas thusfar are parenting a model of a missile to some unknown entity. Thats why i was asking about the vector thrust =]. There are probably other ways to do it, which is why i ask. &lt;&lt;&lt;Hope that was a bit more… understandable.</p>
