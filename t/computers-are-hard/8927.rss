    <description>People, get off that mindset.

Whenever any new idea comes up which has the potential to be interesting, there&#39;s always one clueless asshole in the room who thinks it would add a month to the release date because our precious devs had to ask the Make A Wish Foundation for a way to code through braille.

I imagine the coding involved to track NPC ammo counts would be [a bitch] to say the least.

^ This is what I&#39;m talking about. We&#39;re not supposed to consider something if this asshat has no idea how to do it.

NPC ammo counts? It&#39;s the easiest thing in the world, easier than putting in shell-ejection. Easier than calibrating an acceptable rate-of-fire, even. And I&#39;m pretty sure it was already implemented but removed.


A few things sometimes warrant that response:
&quot;[i]Perhaps it&#39;s a touch too hard for the team to add in the portal gun.[/i]&quot;
&quot;[i]Getting rid of the loading screens and having the maps load dynamically would require re-writing a good chunk of the engine.[/i]&quot;
&quot;[i]There&#39;s no way the team would be able to get a movie file to play on a screen in the game.[/i]&quot;


But short of those things, what business do you have saying an integer is a bitch? What gives you the right to say a heightmap is too much work for the result?

If you&#39;ve never done any work like what you&#39;re commenting on, keep your mouth shut. It seems hard to you because you&#39;re a dumbass.



By the way: I&#39;ve seen AVIs play on a screen [i]in a Half-Life 1 map[/i].</description>

            <p>But computers ARE hard.  I punched mine today (the shitty thing wasn’t booting properly, so a good punch always helps it on it’s way) and it fucking hurt my hand.<br>
They should make computers soft and squishy so that when I punch them it doesn’t hurt me.</p>

            <p>You know, in the process of doing a paper for one of the courses I was doing to get my bachelor’s in computer science, I came across a study on gender’s impact in HCI (human-computer interaction). I remember more info from that study than I remember from some entire courses, for the sole reason it was terribly interesting.</p>
<p>One of the arguments for the need to address gender-HCI was the sad fact that it is mostly men designing computer interfaces. From the sample of students tested in the study, men were willing to browse a lot deeper into menus and settings they were unfamiliar with; the women were uncomfortable operating and experimenting with software they weren’t familiarized to. Recounting childhoods, women cited less supportiveness from friends, teachers, and family in getting into computing than their male-counterparts received.</p>
<p>Eventually the study went on to test navigation strategies within a simulated 3D environment-- a fair or carnival, with a ferris wheel among other obstacles. Ultimately, a few things stood out. With a big screen and roomy field of view, performance on the computer was nearly equal, males getting tasks done a hair quicker. With a tiny screen and severely restricted field of view, males performed somewhat worse… while females suffered drastically more.</p>
<p>The difference in navigational strategy between genders was concretized as such:* Men focus on absolute position (i.e. bearing/coordinates)</p>
<ul>
<li>Women focus on relative position (i.e. landmarks)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found UrBy’s post too late to rage against it directly, and I realized the concept was infuriating me more than the mere individual, so I figured this was the proper section of the forum for a diatribe.</p>

            <p>I think that “it’s too hard” or “it would take too much time” sounds a lot like what we all said about the mod when we first heard of it. Bottom line is, we don’t really know everything that gets developed, what passes through the testing stages and what gets scrapped, until we see the final thing. Take the headcrab latch minigame for example, it was probably a time consuming task to do but it got thrown out because what matters most of all is “does it belong in Black Mesa?” not how awesome it sounds when you imagine it, how easy it is to make or how many people have asked for it.</p>
