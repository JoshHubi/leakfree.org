    <description>I&#39;m at the end of the level after getting through two robot sentries near a hummer. There is a blast door beyond this point with a green button to open it. the problem is when i push the button, instead of it loading the next level, the screen goes black and i get, &quot;unfortunatly black mesa has encountered an error and must close&quot;.  CRASH!    Does any one know how to fix this as i was enjoying this game up to then?    :frowning:</description>
