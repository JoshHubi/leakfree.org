    <title>Looking for some easy to follow FormZ tutorials</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-for-some-easy-to-follow-formz-tutorials/3884</link>
    <description>A project involving building a house in FormZ is coming up, and I&#39;m grossly unprepared.  I *think* I get the basic controls, but are there any clear tutorials (video, text, or otherwise) on really going into making structures?  Greatly appreciated.</description>
