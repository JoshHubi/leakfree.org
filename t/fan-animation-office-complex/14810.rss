    <title>Fan animation--Office Complex</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fan-animation-office-complex/14810</link>
    <description>Just a small bug.  Towards the end of Office Complex there&#39;s an maintenance area with a fan (should be spinning) and blowing wind.  You must flip a switch to turn it off so you can continue.  The wind blows properly but the fan doesn&#39;t spin.  I copied the messages/alerts from the console as well.
