    <title>We should make HL3 after Black Mesa is completed if Valve won&#39;t make it.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/we-should-make-hl3-after-black-mesa-is-completed-if-valve-wont-make-it/12823</link>
    <description>Since they are so involved in Steam, and the hype is so extreme, I don&#39;t know if Valve will ever make HL3. When Black Mesa is completed in 2019, if Valve hasn&#39;t released it and we get their blessing, what if we set the next project to be Half-Life 3 to be completed by 2033? 

I NEED CLOSURE, DAMMIT!</description>

            <p>You’re the boss, I’ve informed the team. They’re on it.</p>
<p>Not really, it was kinda dumb to post that, I think you should just wait and maybe after BM is released some mod devs will help Valve in development of HL3 Ep2 or something…</p>
