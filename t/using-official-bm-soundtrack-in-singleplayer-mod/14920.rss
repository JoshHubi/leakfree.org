    <title>Using Official BM Soundtrack in Singleplayer Mod</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/using-official-bm-soundtrack-in-singleplayer-mod/14920</link>
    <description>Are we allowed to use that amazing album in our workshop mode? I believe we can do it by giving a proper credit to artist (in this case, Joel Nielsen), but i wanted to ask anyways. Don&#39;t want to violate any kind of copyright license.

Edit: Also i want to know about using another copyrighted soundtrack. Just for the atmosphere. For example: using Doom 2016 OST in action sequences. Or Titanic soundtrack in a death scene and etc.</description>

As for your question, you can use the in-game soundtrack for sure. I’ve seen plenty of others use it and I assume it’s because you’re not making money off your project and it’s made for the same game that the soundtrack is created for.<br>
Not sure about other music though.</p>
