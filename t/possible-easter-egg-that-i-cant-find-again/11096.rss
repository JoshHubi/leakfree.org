    <title>Possible Easter Egg that I can&#39;t find again</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/possible-easter-egg-that-i-cant-find-again/11096</link>
    <description>So, in the canyon level of Surface Tension I came across a little hole in the cliff face when you take the alternative route down the cliff, as you could in the original. In the cliff there&#39;s a health pack, a couple of headcrabs spawn and there&#39;s a torch in the corner. Anyway, I recall as I walked in I was teleported and appeared next to a little shack on top of the cliff. There was a picnic bench outside, and inside there were various items on a workbench, a bed, and a notice board with some funny stuff pinned onto it such as a plan written up by Dr Breen with various grammatical errors, and it was a neat little find. However, when my friend replayed it the same thing didn&#39;t happen. 

Does anyone have any idea what I did to make it happen?</description>

            <p>Lost one, this guy has a completely valid question. If you seriously think that he’s trying to make <span class="bbcode-i">anyone</span> mad with this post you need to have your head examined.</p>

<p>You have to go across the top area of the cliff face when you first go out of the pipe. You will see a small cliff room with a computer terminal, a Health Charger, and an H.E.V Charger in the same spot. You have to press a button on the computer terminal, then go back to where you came out of the sewer pipe, climb down a bit, then you’ll find <a href="https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121609709556/9D001BD1200199648CC08A33EE3D9680396EE2F6/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> (sorry for the bugged out model lol), go into the little cave, and you will automatically teleport into <a href="https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/920115494457712354/0CFD3C6A0F96C29FC89AE878E71DB7A094F7F7CE/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.
