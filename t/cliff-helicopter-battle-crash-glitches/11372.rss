    <title>Cliff Helicopter battle crash / glitches</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cliff-helicopter-battle-crash-glitches/11372</link>
    <description>Hey all,

wonderful game, enjoyed it very much thus far.  Originally when fighting the Apache Helicopter on the cliff I wasn&#39;t able to destroy it.  I went back into the room where I found the rocket launcher in search of more rockets.  When I left the room back to the cliff side the helicopter would be shooting randomly and nowhere near me.  It was moving/behaving strangely.  I have retried several times and now the game just crashes on me.  HL2.exe stopped responding with the error information below.  I have also attached the minidump file.

 Problem signature:
  Problem Event Name:	APPCRASH
  Application Name:	hl2.exe
  Application Version:	0.0.0.0
  Application Timestamp:	470c11ae
  Fault Module Name:	client.dll

  Fault Module Timestamp:	504ecc4f
  Exception Code:	c0000005
  Exception Offset:	00362edd
  OS Version:	6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.1
  Locale ID:	4105
  Additional Information 1:	0a9e

  Additional Information 3:	0a9e
  Additional Information 4:	0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789

Thanks!

Cheers,

Jesse

            <p>I’m starting to think that this bug happens when the helicopter can’t see you or you get back to the room  and for whatever reason the AI gets mad because it doesn’t know what to do.</p>

            <p>I THINK I’ve had that issue (or something similar).</p>
<p>The fight was going normally as it should. I ran out of rockets and so I fled to the rocket crate to get some more. Once I ran back to my original hiding place, the Apache was at a right angle from me, and attacking the mountainside.<br>
I was able to run out into the open and just blow it up uninterrupted, but it did kill the immersion a bit (or maybe that was the fact it was my 15th retry…).</p>

            <p>I’m having the same problem as OP - helicopter just continues to fly around the air weirdly and shoot at random stuff. Does this hinder forward progression of the story?</p>

            <p>The helicopter glitches out for me as well. The game never crashed but several reloads always made it glitch out eventually. Very odd. Can’t say I complained though, because that thing can take a shit ton of beating.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem. I managed to get passed by going to task manager and putting high priority on hl2.exe.</p>
<p>Hope it works for you.</p>
