    <description>I am going to have some leftover 20 dollars and I want to spend them at a good racing game. Anyone have a suggestion? I don&#39;t mind realism, if it is fun and enjoyable, then yes.

 (NO NEED FOR SPEED HERE, MY FUN ENDED WHEN THEY GOT SHIFT OUT.)

I am currently torn between grid and TDU 2.</description>

<p>True, and I’m looking forward to Trackmania 2: Canyon.</p>

            <p>I would go with Dirt 3, or a burnout game.</p>
<p>Btw do anyone know anything about the new Burnout game? I saw a short teaser trailer, it didn’t show anything, just some explosions and then ‘Burnout Crash!’ or something like that.</p>
<p>Edit: Never mind, Burnout Crash is like a Kinect arcade shit game from what i have seen.</p>

            <p>NFS wise, my introduction to the series was Most Wanted. It was pretty fun and balanced in difficulty.</p>
<p>Carbon seemed to unbalance things due to the three car types you had to choose from. Each car was good for a different type of event- so while Muscle cars did well in drift events you really had your work cut out for you during races. With tuners it was vice-versa, and drift races were excruciating.</p>
<p>Hell, drift races in Carbon were fucking awful no matter which car you picked. It just wasn’t fun. At least drag in MW was more tolerable and rarer in the events catalog.</p>

            <p>NFS underground (first) was awesome and a here’s a big fuck you to amazingly boring police chase mechanic in HP. Burnout developers should do burnout. Best police action was in High Stakes.</p>

<p>Kindiak park on maximum tickets and maximum laps was a pinnacle of NFS as a police racer.<br>
Everything after underground (sans shift) looks fucking epic for the first 5 minutes than gets woefully boring.</p>
<p>Californicated retards at new NFS team cannot comprehend that a cheap injection of ‘FUCKING EPIC’ does not guarantee a success. But really, EA does not need a successful game (sans shift again)</p>

            <p>I know you said no NFS, but you should really try the latest Hot Pursuit game… no ugly tuner cars, no annoying free roam (well, you can, but it’s pretty useless), no stupid story. Just amazing exotic cars, full contact police pursuits and ridiculous speeds, just like the good ol’ days.<br>
I never enjoyed the NFS: Underground games and the shitload of other games that came after them, but I had fun with Hot Pursuit.</p>

            <p>I played TDU2 when it was beta. I played it after it was released. It’s a douchebag simulator. It really is. The graphics are outdated, the story and atmosphere is superficial and shallow, the IU is broken,  the gameplay is boring and the MMO aspects doesn’t work.</p>
<p>I loved TDU1 and tried really hard to like TDU2, but sadly, they really failed.<br>
The game was being bashed even on it’s own forums last time I was active.</p>

            <p>Forza 3 is the best racing game out there. Absolute beast of a game.</p>
<p>GT4 was a lot of fun as well, but Forza 3 is cheap as chips anyway so there’s not a lot to be saved.</p>
<p>Loving Dirt 3 at the moment, purely for the increased focus on rallying. A lot of fun.</p>
<p>As for Burnout, I reckon Burnout 2 is the best, purely for the soundtrack that adds more as you get faster. But they’ve all been good and are a lot of fun</p>

            <p>For arcade games: Burnout Paradise is good fun and it runs great. Also the Trackmania games are really fun and they are good pick up and play games if you want to just play for short periods of time.<br>
And for rally games, the original DiRT is a great rally game and for $10 it’s more than worth your money.<br>
I also really like XPand Rally but that’s more sim-oriented</p>

            <p>Grid is alot of fun, regardless if you tend to drive agressive or passive. And the “Instant Replay” saves you the “Restart race after fucking up Lap 5/5 hurrdurr…” frustration.</p>

            <p>I’ve always been preferential to the Burnout series. It’s how all arcade racers should play (and how Split/Second <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> have). Simwise I do have Forza 1 and 3. F-Zero GX is also one of my favorites. Oh, and don’t forget Wipeout HD.</p>

            <p>DiRT 3 is good for rally, but I’m a bit bummed at the lack of environments in the newer games. Shift 2 is immense, if you can get that in your budget then for the love of god do it.</p>
<p>Also get it on PC because both of the DLC packs are free for us <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Why? I love Shift, very realistic. GRiD is in the same branch by the way, except a little more arcade, but still damn fun. DiRT 1 is really great if you love rally. DiRT 2 is good too, but it’s more about X Games than true euro rally. I still havn’t played DiRT 3 though.</p>

            <p>You haven’t specified format so I’d say Forza 3, it is a better game than Gran Tourismo (yes it doesn’t have as many cars, but if that’s how you rate a game then go buy an encyclopedia)</p>
<p>ninja’d</p>
<p>I don’t personally play racers on PC, just can’t find anything that compares to console versions.  Post up if you find anything good!</p>
