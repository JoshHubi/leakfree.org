    <title>Steam Early Access release questions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-early-access-release-questions/13790</link>
    <description>First off, Hooray Steam release! I was disappointed to see it&#39;s not the full release yet though.

Having said that, what has actually changed from the initial release? The store page had hardly any information on it regarding this stuff.

And speaking of the store page, there is this -
[quote=&quot;Steam Early Access Page&quot;]
Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?
 “Yes. Black Mesa will be $19.99 USD during the Early Access phase.”[/size][/size]
[/quote]
Can we get some clarification about what the price will be AFTER Early Access? Because as it stands that tells us nothing we can&#39;t see from the price on the storefront.

Also, do you still intend to release a new version of the free mod? It was stated a while ago that there would be an updated free version shortly after the steam release.

And finally, no matter what the project, developers posting rave reviews the moment a product hits the store page is kind of bad form guys, come on.</description>

<p>Early access is designed so that you <span class="bbcode-b">never</span> have to pay twice. If you buy the game in early access, you get it forever. Never have to pay again or pay extra.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, I knew that part, but I wasn’t willing to buy until I knew Xen was being worked on. Last we heard ages ago was “much later”, which was disheartening. I care less about the money and more about the time. If we had to wait for a long list of bugs to be fixed before work on Xen even began, I wouldn’t have bought it yet. But TextFAMGUY1 made it clear that work on Xen was simultaneous. You guys should make that fact more widely known!</p>
<p>I’m still not going to even install it until Xen is ready. I’m just going to read about bug progress til then.</p>

</aside>
<p>By which I assume you’re meaning that the planned development of Xen would rely on things in the new engine that wouldn’t be possible in the old mod-compatible version, and therefore you’d have to build two completely different versions of Xen to put it in both the Free and Retail versions. That makes complete sense.</p>
<p>I’ve read the argument that buying now helps fund the development of Xen, and without it there’s less reason to expect it to be done, and it’s a good argument. I did think that over for awhile. Still thinking it over, actually.</p>
<p>So far I’ve seen a few gameplay bugs listed as planned to be fixed, either soon or later, and that’s good. But will development of the Xen levels only come after a majority of discovered bugs in the current release are fixed? That could take a while, bugs have a way of piling up.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is a section of the team dedicated to fixing existing issues and maintaining MP, while the rest of us work on Xen.</p>
<p>We’re very fluid and will be working on different things simultaneously.</p>

<p>By which I assume you’re meaning that the planned development of Xen would rely on things in the new engine that wouldn’t be possible in the old mod-compatible version, and therefore you’d have to build two completely different versions of Xen to put it in both the Free and Retail versions. That makes complete sense.</p>
<p>I’ve read the argument that buying now helps fund the development of Xen, and without it there’s less reason to expect it to be done, and it’s a good argument. I did think that over for awhile. Still thinking it over, actually.</p>
<p>So far I’ve seen a few gameplay bugs listed as planned to be fixed, either soon or later, and that’s good. But will development of the Xen levels only come after a majority of discovered bugs in the current release are fixed? That could take a while, bugs have a way of piling up.</p>

<p>I thought so too, but don’t see any details on it. And anyway, I’d buy it. I just might not buy it until Xen’s there.  If the whole SP campaign was completed and offered both free and paid, I’d buy it. If the whole SP campaign was completed and offered only retail, I’d buy it. But as long as the whole SP campaign is not complete…</p>

<p>If you buy it now, you get it for the Early Access price and get Xen for free when it comes out.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well… I don’t know when that is and unfortunately I’ve been a little burned on early access and (not directly related) kickstarter things over the last few years, so I don’t always assume that something promised is going to come to fruition. I realize that the team has spent several years working on rebuilding the core game and getting it into Steam, and that’s certainly a good thing. But the old FAQ said Xen was a “long way off” and I don’t know that there’s any update on its progress. I don’t think we’ve even been told it’s being worked on yet. I get the impression that the first order of business is going to be stabilizing the game on Steam.  Who knows what will happen between now and then? Who knows when, if, the Xen levels will be completed?</p>
<p>Based on the information available, I’m willing to wait to buy it until the SP experience is completed. If I knew that Xen was coming in a timeframe rather than “when it’s done”, I’d have to think that over.</p>

            <p>oh… so Xen’s not there yet? Well… maybe I’ll buy it now and wait for it before I play. Or maybe I’ll buy it when it’s complete. I was hoping with the detail of the teaser countdown it was all complete! Part of me says wait for Xen at the extra $5 cost rather than $20 now and the risk it is never finished.</p>
