    <title>Machine gun (mp5)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/machine-gun-mp5/10130</link>
    <description>First of all, I think you guys did a really great job. I&#39;ll write up some kind of full report when I&#39;m finished with the game. 

However, I want to say something about the mp5. I really, really hate 3 shot burst. When it comes to video games, I think it is my biggest pet peeve of anything. 

Anyway, I don&#39;t care if its kept in, as long as there is an option to set it so that one round at a time can be fired. And if someone can tell me how to just, like, I don&#39;t know go into the code and change it I&#39;ll do that and be on my way. 

Thanks.</description>

<p>That’s not the issue people are having: when you just click once, you burst-fire 3 bullets automatically.  They want to be able to shoot just one bullet.</p>

<p>Well for me, gameplay is just as important as realism. However, I still think that you should be able to turn off the burst in the options.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>But then there’s no real explanation as to why you couldn’t give the MP5 the hallow-points. Say you run out of standard 9mm rounds with your MP5 in the middle of a firefight, and you’ve got 100 more rounds of the same caliber that your MP5 is actually capable of firing, but you can’t. Your Glock is the only firearm aloud to use it, and for no reason.</p>
<p>The explanations of separate reserve pools are getting really contrived, and trying to use different types of the same ammunition is really grasping at straws to come up with an excuse.</p>

<p>One more thing to support the round pool vs mag pool theory: Say you’ve got a mag with 7 rounds loaded in the Glock, then fire all of your ammo with the MP5. Switching back to the Glock shows the ammo in the mag was never touched. Same with a fully loaded round or the MP5.</p>
<p>So the ammo is never in either weapon’s magazines until it’s loaded into the gun, and never leaves the mag except out the barrel.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>An alternative that would have allowed for separate reserves would be making it so that the 2 weapons use different versions of the same ammunition: The Glock 17 uses 9 millimeter by 19 millimeter Parabellum hollow-point bullets, while the MP5 uses 9 millimeter by 19 millimeter Parabellum solid-point bullets. This would also explain why the Glock 17 does more damage per hit &amp; has more stopping power than the MP5 despite them using the same ammunition type. Likewise, sorry for being off-topic, but the Gluon Gun should be modified to use Uranium-235 as ammunition, in homage to the Tau Cannon &amp; Gluon Gun sharing the unrealistically-named “Depleted Uranium-235” as ammunition in the original game. Of course, with the Uranium-235 change, the Tau Cannon would still use Depleted Uranium. Back on topic, I at least think there should be a menu option to disable the burst-fire based on personal preference, like somebody mentioned a while back.</p>

            <p>That’d be neat, as it would make sense for HECU to be using carbine rifles outside as opposed to the SMGs they used inside, but it’s more work than it’s worth, I’d say.</p>
<p>But from a gameplay perspective it changes nothing. Whether the damage your doing is .7 or 3, you’re still firing so fast that the minute change in damage is hardly enough for you to tell the difference.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’d be cool if we got an MP5 as is at first, but then after Apprehension it’s completely replaced by M4A1’s. Just keep the ammo pools for the Pistol and SMG separated, and have 2 different pickups for the automatic ammo (one of an SMG mag only seen before App., and one of a Rifle mag only seen after App.).</p>

            <p>Does it really matter if it’s an MP5 or an M4, or are we talking separate ammo pools?</p>
<p>Also, personally, I fail to see how the MP5 is useless… It’s less accurate, than the Glock, true, but it’s still way more accurate than it was in Half-Life.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure it also actually did <span class="bbcode-i">less</span> damage per shot.</p>

            <p>That’s why I believe they should have “retconned” the mp5 and use the HD’s M4 instead with higher damage than glock and separate ammunition… it makes sense from gameplay perspective too since mp5 renders the glock useless… oh wait, IT DOESN’T!!! Glock is more accurate, making the mp5 a wasted weapon taking space for nothing… please BM devs, change it to M4, increase its damage slightly and call it a day.</p>

            <p>Not at all.<br>
It’s a gameplay decision from the original that they kept in Black Mesa. There’s nothing stopping them from changing it other than whether they want to or not.</p>

<p>I’m not big on gun knowledge, but if I’m not mistaken they share the same round, so it doesn’t matter if the magazines aren’t the same. The same type of ammunition is loaded into the magazine. It’s arguable that the reserve is a <span class="bbcode-i">9mm round</span> reserve as opposed to a Glock &amp; MP5 reserve. Or that the rounds swap mags depending on which weapon needs them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So, coding limitations in the game itself prevent “same ammo type, separate reserve pool” scenarios.</p>

<p>They share a reserve because they both use 9mm Ammunition.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I know that. Why is it that, in video games where multiple weapons use the same ammunition type, they always share a reserve pool? That just bugs me. I mean, is it due to coding limitations?</p>

            <p>The main thing that bugs me with the MP5 is the fact that it shares a reserve pool with the Glock 17. This bugs me because their magazines look nothing alike.</p>
