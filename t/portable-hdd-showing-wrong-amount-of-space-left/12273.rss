    <title>Portable HDD showing wrong amount of space left</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portable-hdd-showing-wrong-amount-of-space-left/12273</link>
    <description>So I have a 500 GB portable HDD and it&#39;s saying that there&#39;s only like 40 GB left. When I go into the files on it, highlight them all, and click properties, it says they only take up 90 GB. I&#39;ve shown all folders and there still doesn&#39;t seem to be anything that would take up the other ~350 GB worth of usable space. I checked if it somehow got partitioned as well and still no idea what could be causing this. I ran CheckDisk within Windows and it seemed to have made it worse or not changed anything at all. I could format it but I&#39;d prefer to do something else if possible.

Edit: Just a few more things about the hidden files. So I backed up my laptop&#39;s stuff awhile ago and I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re part of the backup or not. There are three of them: $RECYCLE.BIN, RECYCLER, and System Volume Information. The first two allow me to open them but all the files within them won&#39;t allow me to open them. The first one has a link to my main HDD&#39;s recycle bin. The third folder won&#39;t let me open it at all.</description>

            <p>Yep, I fixed it earlier today by formatting the drive. Not sure exactly what went wrong but the format fixed it.</p>

            <p>It shouldn’t be hundreds of gigs worth of discrepancy though. I’m currently moving my stuff off the HDD and am going to format it. I found that there was a folder that wasn’t being counted before that was part of the backup that was 100 GB. That still doesn’t account for all of it though.</p>

            <p>Sometimes the space left thing fluctuates by several GB. It’s really weird.</p>

            <p>I don’t know if I have enough space left (that it’s showing at least) to defragment. I’ll try though before I try the formatting. I should have space on my main HDD to copy the files over, so no need for 1000 floppy discs  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  .</p>
<p>And I don’t know if it might be related to this issue but I’ve had it like 75% filled for years and just got around to deleting all but the 90 GB (actually more because I downloaded some files to it) that’s on it now.</p>
<p>Edit: According to the Windows defrag tool the drive has no fragmentation. I’m currently moving the files over to my primary HDD to format the portable one.</p>

            <p>Try defragmenting it, or copy all your files onto a bunch of floppy discs, format it, then transfer them back.</p>
<p>[color=’<span class="hashtag">#171717</span>’]I’m just going to keep offering advice on things I’m completely unqualified for until someone asks me to stop.</p>
