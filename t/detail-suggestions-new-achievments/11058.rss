    <title>Detail suggestions, new achievments</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/detail-suggestions-new-achievments/11058</link>
    <description>This is actually a pretty minor suggestion for black mesa, but I think the barnacles should throw out mostly xenian body parts on xen, having them spit exclusively human body parts was a bit strange back in half llife  :smiley: 

Also how about some new achievments? Maybe something about killing a certain number of headcrabs with crab corpses or finishing about 10 alien grunts with the crowbar, playing through a specific chapter with only the hivehand, etc..
There is much room for creativity!

Anyone got some ideas for achievments?</description>

            <p>For Xen I dunno, but for what we’ve got, would be nice some extra achievements.</p>
