    <description>Someone will have to change the title tomorrow most likely but I&#39;m pretty excited about this.

And the most recent thing from the source code of the site that is most likely the title. .&#39;s are vowels, x&#39;s are consonants. Eternity.

I hope it&#39;s a new IP and not a WoT game that people keep predicting or something else like that.</description>

They’re paying just as much attention to noncombat as they are to combat. Experience for noncombat abilities is separate from experience from combat and using noncombat abilities has no affect on being able to use combat abilities.</p>

<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Through a variety of techniques (e.g. martial training, meditation, ritualistic evocation, mortification of the flesh), some individuals are able to draw upon the energy of their soul to accomplish extraordinary feats. These abilities range from the mundanely superhuman to the explosively magical. Having a strong soul seems to make this easier, but sometimes even people with fragmented souls are able to accomplish the extraordinary. The individual’s body seems to act as a conduit and battery for this power, drawing in replenishment from seemingly omnipresent “fields” of unbound spiritual energy in the world around them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So souls are the main source of power in this game. It’s pretty different, which is good. It’s not just make sign=magic spell.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The cultures of Project Eternity are in a variety of different technological states. Though some remote civilizations are still in the equivalent of Earth’s Stone Age or Bronze Age, most large civilizations are in the equivalent of Earth’s high or late Middle Ages. The most aggressive and powerful civilizations are in the early stages of what would be our early modern period, technologically, even if they are not culturally undergoing “Renaissance”-style changes.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s not purely medieval like normal fantasy either. It’s everything from the stone age to the late Renaissance in technological terms, leaving quite a stretch of potential enemies. And that means guns.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Black powder firearms are of the single-shot wheellock variety. Largely considered complex curiosities, these weapons are not employed extensively by military forces. Their long reload times are considered a liability in battles against foes that are too monstrous to drop with a single volley, foes that fly or move at high speed, and foes that have the power of invisibility. Despite this, some individuals do employ firearms for one specific purpose: close range penetration of the arcane veil, a standard magical defense employed by wizards. The arcane veil is powerful, but it does not react well to the high-velocity projectiles generated by arquebuses and handguns. As a result, more wizards who previously relied on the veil and similar abjurations have turned to traditional armor for additional defense.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Guns are mostly used for counter-magic, which is an awesome idea I think.</p>

            <p>Okay so new info.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity/posts/310512" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity/posts/310512</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Set-Up<br>
The player witnesses an extraordinary and horrific supernatural event that thrusts them into a unique and difficult circumstance. Burdened with the consequences of this event, the player has to investigate what has happened in order to free themselves from the restless forces that follow and haunt them wherever they go.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sounds a lot like Berserk and I’m not complaining about that.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Character Creation<br>
At a minimum, players will be able to specify their main character’s name, sex, class, race (including subrace), culture, traits, ability scores, portrait, and the fundamental starting options of his or her class (gear, skills, and talents). We have not worked out customization details of character avatars, but we believe those are important and will be updating on these specifics in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Pretty deep, which is cool.</p>
<p>And there’s some other cool things on that page too, such as there’s going to be main races but each race is going to be split into many subraces as well depending on where a group of that race lives. You’re going to have companions but they’re not forced on you. You can play the entire game alone if you’d like. It looks like there’s going to be so many ways to play too and so many choices to make, which is fine by me.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">Project Eternity</span> will take the central hero, memorable companions and the epic exploration of <span class="bbcode-i">Baldur’s Gate</span>, add in the fun, intense combat and dungeon diving of <span class="bbcode-i">Icewind Dale</span>, and tie it all together with the emotional writing and mature thematic exploration of <span class="bbcode-i">Planescape: Torment</span>.</p>
<p>Combat uses a tactical real-time with pause system - positioning your party and coordinating attacks and abilities is one of the keys to success. The world map is dotted with unique locations and wilderness ripe for exploration and questing. You’ll create your own character and collect companions along the way – taking him or her not just through this story, but, with your continued support, through future adventures. You will engage in dialogues that are deep, and offer many choices to determine the fate of you and your party. …and you’ll experience a story that explores mature themes and presents you with complex, difficult choices to shape how your story plays out.</p>

            <p>Obsidian go alright, they generally know how to craft interesting worlds and stories, and then let themselves down with horrid bugs and janky arse gameplay (im looking at you, Alpha Protocol)… Hopefully its something a bit more unique than cardboard cutout tolkien style high fantasy</p>
