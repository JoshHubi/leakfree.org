            <p>I played the original Slender recently. It’s not that it’s scary; it’s just really really hard. Like, I could never get any more than 3/8 pages.</p>

<p>I think he means that there is ALWAYS a way around the obstacle. The game is going to try to present it to you somehow.</p>
<p>As for Amnesia, that stopped being scary after the first time I “died” and realized that all that happens is you get displaced a few feet. So I just abused that repeatedly late game.</p>

            <p>Co-op horror just does not work. It’s not scary in the slightest, and making the game work in co-op kills some of the atmosphere. Look at how F.E.A.R. 3 got butchered to make the game fully co-op. They brought back a dead character in a way that made no sense, there wasn’t a scary sequence in the whole game, and there were just shootouts everywhere. I know it’s presumptuous of me to think that horror cannot be done in co-op, but it’s highly unlikely you’ll manage to pull off the right atmosphere to scare the player when you have some mouth-breathing thirteen year old swearing up a storm in your ear looking for dog tags or coffee mugs. It would have to be like Journey or something, where there’s no voice comm between players, if that.</p>

<p>What a shame horror games don’t work as co-op.</p>

</aside>
<p>What I wouldn’t give for a survival horror game that forces in engine VOIP and puts two players in a maze and separates them while they run from some crazy shit. Their voices would be realistically occluded and reverbed in the environment, meaning that anyone can get abandoned at any time. It also means that the players can unwittingly scare the shit out of each other.<br>
Of course there’d be more than that, but it’s the only way I see COOP horror working.</p>

<p>It’s kinda hard for me to get scared in a game, mainly because it’s made to be beaten. Weather you have to take a certain route or wait for an enemy to pass, it all was planned to be beaten. If a game gave me the feel that I can never beat it, or something like ARMA where you have to make your own way to beat it, that would be very scary.</p>
<p>Slenderwise, they should make him extrude his arms and attack you at some point. In the freeware version all he does is teleport and look at you. Not really scary if you think about it.</p>

<p>I watched a few vids just now, it’s pretty creepy. It seems like a psychological thriller/ Dark horror thing. It’s very deep with all the different Big bad wolves. I wish they had more tools to make the game’s animation more fluent, it removes  the horror from it.</p>

<p>It’s kinda hard for me to get scared in a game, mainly because it’s made to be beaten. Weather you have to take a certain route or wait for an enemy to pass, it all was planned to be beaten. If a game gave me the feel that I can never beat it, or something like ARMA where you have to make your own way to beat it, that would be very scary.</p>

<p>You should try out Tale of Tales’s “The Path” then. In their interpretation of The Red Riding Hood, there is nothing to “beat”, and you sure as hell do not win anything. It is both beautiful and monstrous, as well as being very scary.</p>

            <p>I hope it gets done! The last mod this guy made never got done, but he said with a team this time around, it’ll get done. I hope so :3. I already have a co-op game planned.</p>

<p>Solution: Add weapons.</p>
<p>Since this game is multiplayer I may just try it out. Would be great to hear “Uhh… I think I might have…! OH SHIT! AAA-”</p>
