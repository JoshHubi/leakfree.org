    <title>i just had the weirdest dream about black mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-just-had-the-weirdest-dream-about-black-mesa/3692</link>
    <description>yeah, we all have dreams, this is acrtually the first time i dreamed about a game. ok this is how it started.

so, i wake up (inside the dream) and turn on my laptop, when i go to my brothers room where he is playing BMS! :smiley:  he turs to me and says, hey its released.

he was awready in surface tension, there where grunts everywhere crowbaring the scientists, and guess.

the crowbars where made of bubles, yeah, srsly wtf.

then i start a new game, (the whole dream was in first person)
so, i see that BLACK MESA brack screen, then i hear a choper. (a helicopter if you may) when the screen fades back to normal gordon, instad of starting in the tram, he starts in the back seat of a helicopter, i think, barney was driving it. and there was snow, instad of being a desert, it was snowing. you could hear catzeyes voice (what should be the tram voice) i never remember hearing it, i think my brain just, invented the voice, it was really alike her&#39;s. so, we land. the hev suit is blue, and suddently in on a rail. :fffuuu:

the whole chapter was made of wood and you had to carry the, train, thingy whatever it was on your back, then suddently i take of the glock and it shoots paper rounds.:jizz:

then i finaly wake up. it was the wierdest dream, ever.
lets hope black mesa isnt like that, :wink:</description>

<p>Which issue?</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve dreamed about 007 Goldeneye a few times, as well as other games I have and TF2, but BM is the one I’ve dreamed (yet <span class="bbcode-i">dreamt</span> gives me a spelling error?) about the most frequently and lately. But I never actually get to play it, just get a DVD copy from Ram, or celebrate the release at a dinner party where I somehow recognize everybody, etc, etc.<br>
At least I haven’t had a nightmare about playing it, then trying to turn it off afterwords and it wouldn’t. [COLOR=‘Black’]That put me off Goldeneye for a year when I was little.</p>

            <p>I had one dream about BM where I woke up and my sister came upstairs and told me it was released. I went to the site to download it (for some reason it looked like Tremulous’ website) and ran the game. This big message came up on screen reading “PeeHead” and then I got BSoD… That dream sucked.</p>

            <p>when the game started we where in the helicopter instad of in the tram, i probably dreamed about the helicopter because i downloaded a air veichles pack for gmod, and the helicopter was equaly the same as the one for gmod, no detail missed, this one:<br>
<a href="https://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&amp;id=84091" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&amp;id=84091</a><br>
it was realy awsome because it had very good graphics and very realistic, also actually moved and shacked like a actuall helicopter, this dream was a awsome yet awkward experience.</p>

            <p>I also had a dream about Black Mesa. It wasn’t even in Black Mesa, just some blocky Ravenholm style area. And there was only one zombie. Sucked.</p>

            <p>yeah, we all have dreams, this is acrtually the first time i dreamed about a game. ok this is how it started.</p>
<p>so, i wake up (inside the dream) and turn on my laptop, when i go to my brothers room where he is playing BMS! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  he turs to me and says, hey its released.</p>
<p>he was awready in surface tension, there where grunts everywhere crowbaring the scientists, and guess.</p>
<p>the crowbars where made of bubles, yeah, srsly wtf.</p>
<p>then i start a new game, (the whole dream was in first person)<br>
so, i see that BLACK MESA brack screen, then i hear a choper. (a helicopter if you may) when the screen fades back to normal gordon, instad of starting in the tram, he starts in the back seat of a helicopter, i think, barney was driving it. and there was snow, instad of being a desert, it was snowing. you could hear catzeyes voice (what should be the tram voice) i never remember hearing it, i think my brain just, invented the voice, it was really alike her’s. so, we land. the hev suit is blue, and suddently in on a rail. :fffuuu:</p>
<p>the whole chapter was made of wood and you had to carry the, train, thingy whatever it was on your back, then suddently i take of the glock and it shoots paper rounds.:jizz:</p>
<p>then i finaly wake up. it was the wierdest dream, ever.<br>
lets hope black mesa isnt like that, <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
