    <title>Humble Indie Bundle</title>

    <description>only 20 hours left! this is such a great deal, and i am loving the results of it.

This is a great idea, it goes to a great cause and you get some really fun games. 

I wanna make sure everyone knows about this so they can get their last little bit of donations before it ends. and it is not fake or a scam, even check on [url]https://www.eff.org/[/url] they are legit and they link to it.

everyone should head over and donate some money to charity, and play some free games!
