    <title>Water and Reflection Textures</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/water-and-reflection-textures/10050</link>
    <description>NOTE: I have a relatively bad computer so when I started up the game I immediately changed most settings to LOW and unchecked everything under &quot;Performance&quot;

When I first got my pistol, it seemed to be completely covered in black/purple checkers across it. Once I got to the first sewer area (right next to the first Vort) and the lighting got darker, I noticed that the black/purple checkers nearly faded (not completely). Then, when I turned the valve to make the water level go up, once the water completely covered me, the screen was completely Purple/black. I installed it all correctly. Halp?

            <p>I changed my dxlevel to 90, the game is now showing directx 9.0 for hardware, but I’m still haveing the same issue as the OP.<br>
I know my graphics card isn’t anything special (it sucks) maybe that’s the problem.<br>
Specs: Intel Quad 2.5<br>

<p>Well, your videocard is from the same boat as Radeon 9500 were but is a slower edition of it (which isn’t a surprise for it being a chipset integrated one). BMS requires to use DirectX 9 renderpath of the Source engine to work properly, it does not implement necessary fallbacks to work with dxlevel 80/81. At the first BMS start Source engine had detected your GPU and automatically adjusted renderer properties for it. Most likely it had chosen to use DirectX 8.0 or 8.1 renderpath - and that’s the cause of your problems. What you should do is to add “-dxlevel 90” to the command line parameters for the BMS and then start it up once. It should switch into using DX9 and reset all the settings to defaults. Then quit it and remove “-dxlevel” switch you had added. Start it up again, set the desired output resolution, then go to the advanced gfx settings dialog and make sure it states “DirectX 9.0” for “Software direct x level”. Then switch all the settings to the minimum and hope that FPS won’t be in single-digits range.</p>
<p>Technically your GPU is capable of DirectX9 SM 1.4 thus it should be able to properly render for this game. Practically it’s that old so it isn’t known for sure if would it work or not.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. Where people’s eyes are supposed to be is the checkers, as well.</p>

<p>Am I missing anything?<br>
It says DirectX 9, but I’m pretty sure I run 8.1<br>
Finally, I didn’t download this on an administrator, could that be a problem? I think I have ics Carda firewall on hl2.exe, as well, but this has never happened other than when I HL2-Roleplayed. (Stopped happening after downloaded the map out of garry’s mod.)</p>
