    <title>The torrent needs more peers...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-torrent-needs-more-peers/13702</link>
    <description>I tried the .zip files, which were difficult. So I took the advice and downloaded the torrent, but there are no peers with this one. :/ What ever happened to downloading things from a website&#39;s download provider, that says, &quot;sign up for premium for faster downloads,&quot; but instead I just wait in line?</description>

            <p>I just finished downloading a different torrent (from <a href="https://www.gamershell.com/download_93608.shtml" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, another official mirror) which included the same files so I can seed the main torrent.</p>
<p>(also most likely no one knows me since 1. I was never really a regular here, and 2. I changed my name/avi to match my Steam.)</p>

            <p>this is so ridiculous. by the time I get to part 2, each of the different links still bring me to the beginning of the installation with “couldn’t find the file, did you download it?”</p>
<p>Why is BMS so difficult to download?</p>

            <p>Part of the problem is that of the three files needed for the game, one of those files is 3 gigs. This is huge. Humongous. Big. Monster. And a dreadfully long download for some people.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I tried every single link on this spreadsheet <a href="https://bit.ly/1D7bHqJ" data-bbcode="true">https://bit.ly/1D7bHqJ</a> with the exception of the torrent links. I was able to verify that the downloads DO work, although each of them took at least an hour of downloading on my ‘high speed’ internet. So if there is a continuing problem with the links, I can only guess it is as a result of a bad connection, nerfed bandwidth or other standard issue you might see when attempting to download a 3 gig file.</p>
<p>Regarding the torrent… I HAVE heard the complaint that no one is seeding it. I personally have yet to get on the torrent bandwagon otherwise I would do this ‘seeding’ you speak of.</p>
<p>Perhaps others that are reading this thread could perhaps do their part and seed it for the fanbase?   Pretty please?  :love:</p>
