    <title>Video Card Issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/video-card-issues/7832</link>
    <description>I was playing tf2 and right when I started a round, the whole level glitched out and there were fun colors and pixels and everything. I attempted to run other games on other engines, (namely: Minecraft and deus ex human revolution) and all of them seemed to have the same problem,

individual or groups of four pixels would stop working and there would generally be artifacts all over the screen. It sounds like standard Graphics card overheating, but even when it is cool, and well aerated, it still happens.
I actually just got a blue screen after a particularly bad freeze. windows starts and runs normally, and videos play fine, but occasionally firefox will even trigger it.

when I first got this card, it was actually defective and i had to send away for a new one, so it could have just broken after a while, but the warranty is easily expired now.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, if nothing can be done, i had actually planned to get a new computer with SLI so its not a big deal, I would just have to accelerate my schedule and draw from my offshore accounts.

TL/DR
Whenever I open a game or firefox my pixels glitch out, monitor says its not getting an input, and screen goes black, sometimes I can open task manager and stop the offending program before the point of no return.

TL/DR the TL/DR
My video card is fucked.

Specs (from memory)
Nvidia GTX 280 (brand new drivers)
4 gigs ram
windows 7 64 bit</description>

            <p>Alright, I feel like a noob.  My drivers are version 275.33.  I think the problem was, the DVI cable was falling out of the monitor.  I never use the screws because they are a pain and (usually) useless.  I have tightened the screws, and if this problem happens again, I’ll post my specs and see if anyone can help.</p>

            <p>I’ll see what version of the drivers I have first thing when I get home.  I haven’t even checked for updated drivers since July, so that could be it, if 280.26 came out around then.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>check your event log for error “Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered”</p>
<p>Considering it’s new drivers and problem with blank screen is triggered with firefox mostly, seems it’s the same case:</p>
<p><a href="https://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=207666&amp;st=0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=207666&amp;st=0</a></p>
<p>For me this behaviour occured after installing 280.26 WHQL. After reverting back to 275.33 there is no problem again. Guys from Nvidia did some changes from 280.26 to power state and various cards 4xx/5xx causing this error at various conditions. Some users reported that 285.27 fixed their issue, some reported that even rollback to 275.33 didn’t helped a few users waiting with even older drivers 26x.xx, but mostly it is 280.26 and above which causing this problem. You can try rolback to 275.33 (but proper procedure, multiple restarts, using driversweeper etc)<br>
Sorry for my painful english <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>If you are running a second gen i3/i5/i7 with an H67/P67/Z67 this is a known issue with the intel chipsets, I have it too, supposedly to be fixed in a near future bios update. I´d suggest you install the latest bios update for your board if this is the case.</p>

            <p>in deed, I got it back in the day when I bouth an 9800GX2 by evga and it came with it, ever since whenever I´ve needed something like that I download it from evga, because while you can use other software to monitor temps, precision actually lets you to set what percentage of fan usage you want at what temps, quite usefull for an overheating gpu : )</p>

<p>This, helluva program, very useful.  I got an overclocking/monitoring program with the gtx 550ti I bought about a month back, program is called smart doctor or something like that. works just as well as evga though.</p>

            <p>What they said before. check your temps.</p>
<p>Also you say you have new drivers? did you have the same problem with the older ones too? if not you could try to go back to the older drivers.<br>
just make sure you uninstall the drivers completly before installing the other ones again.</p>
