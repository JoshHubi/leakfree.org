    <title>Free vs Steam version</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/free-vs-steam-version/13578</link>
    <description>Can you please explain to me what will be the differences between the (new) free version and the paid version of Black Mesa?

Are there graphical improvements (what kind of?) or are also the xen levels going to be exclusive?

Thanks!</description>

<p>I just have to say this right now, I’d say everyone here should get the Steam version. I understand the mod is supposed to be free. But these developers have put SO MUCH blood, tears, and sweat into this mod… and everyone just downloads it for free? I understand some people don’t have the money. But this is a labor of love to the fans. And yet we still have people asking “Where’s Xen? Where’s Xen?” can’t anyone just appreciate that we are getting a remake of a masterpiece?</p>
<p>I understand all of the impatience for Xen. But please understand the developers are busy tweaking the game to be awesome, like adding multiplayer, fixing bugs, and adding a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>Xen can wait honestly. If you guys want it to be rushed out, then you obviously don’t understand it from their perspective.</p>
<p>You see I like Apple more than Microsoft. Hear me out, Apple produces good-quality products (at least when Steve Jobs was CEO. Not sure about how Tim Cook or John Scully are doing…)</p>
<p>Microsoft produces 3rd-rate products. Can I tell you why? Because Microsoft cares more about the sales and marketing and less about the content/product/consumer.</p>
<p>Apple cares about the content/product/consumer first.</p>
<p>Or for example, how the COD devs are literally the worst since they could already have a full game but instead like to split off little portions to create “DLC” that they can profit off of.</p>
<p>And don’t get me started on EA…</p>
<p>Point is, if all of you people here want Xen so soon.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this question, do you want to play a rushed piece of shit?</p>
<p>Or do you want to play a really good experience that will last with you for a while. Xen should be beautiful. Because it’s a beautiful finale to such a beautiful masterpiece.</p>
<p>Patience is a virtue. Can’t anyone just wait for Xen to come out? Can people please stop bugging the devs so much about Xen?</p>
<p>Don’t you know they have more important issues on their hands right now? Like the fact that they have a real-life, and a real job, and some of them have real families and stuff? Can’t anyone give them a break? I mean it is the holidays and stuff and everyone is just… I don’t know.</p>
<p>I am patient. And I am proud to say that the Black Mesa Team is awesome, and that everything they are doing right now is awesome, and I give all of them a big hug and kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>They deserve money folks. They are doing this for us and for everyone.</p>
<p>They deserve to work at VALVE…</p>
<p>They are fucking awesome.</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>They are amazing, they deserve more than just a free download.</p>
<p>I’m sorry I sound a little brash blunt or rude…</p>
<p>But I’m just so sick’n tired of all of the comments asking where’s Xen and stuff. And I’ve just seen so much shit on the forums of people bugging the devs about Xen that I just had it up to here.</p>
<p>Now then…</p>
<p>That’s all I have to say. I know I don’t post that much, but that’s because I don’t get on that much.</p>
<p>Anyway, God bless the Black Mesa devs.</p>
<p>And mostly, I love you Black Mesa Developer Team! Keep up the good work!</p>
<p>&lt;3</p>

<p>Most of the fans of Black Mesa will probably buy it when it comes out but there will still be a free version for people that don’t want to buy it. (don’t know why they wouldn’t)</p>

            <p>Actually I find ST Uncut <span class="bbcode-b">perfect</span> and for OaR Uncut, it’s <span class="bbcode-b">soooooo good</span>, except the outdoor area. Yes, it’s pretty and yes, it adds a more open gameplay to Black Mesa’s mostly linear combat, but getting shot from every possible angle and from 2 miles range and from a tower isn’t fun, it’s frustrating. But rather than the map itself being to blame, I guess that’s the fault of BM’s soldier AI and configuration. If anything, I’d get rid of the sniper as well.</p>

<p>Not sure about the new free version but retail now has an optional “auto crouch jump” feature. I was actually one of the team members hugely in support of crouch jumping the way it was in our mod, but the auto crouch jump has totally won me over. It’s so good.</p>
<p>No, it will not. And they will not be integrated, as per both the team’s wishes and my own wishes.</p>

<p>Not sure about the new free version but retail now has an optional “auto crouch jump” feature. I was actually one of the team members hugely in support of crouch jumping the way it was in our mod, but the auto crouch jump has totally won me over. It’s so good.</p>

<p>No, it will not. And they will not be integrated, as per both the team’s wishes and my own wishes.</p>
<p>I will endeavor to convert and recompile/repackage everything to make it compatible with retail, and on the workshop - hopefully for day 1. If not, then hopefully reasonably soon.</p>

            <p>The paid version will be using the source 2011 or source 2013 engine so I don’t know if any existing mods will be compatible with it. Maybe one of the devs could answer this question?</p>

<p>You mean the jump height right? You can easily fix that by changing these skill.cfg files to 200.</p>
<p>bms_normal_jump_vertical_speed			       “120”<br>
bms_normal_jump_crouch_vertical_speed		       “120”</p>

            <p>As far as I know you can have both steam game and mod on the same machine. I have both currently and there is no conflict. They are different engines and don’t “share” files.<br>
As far as patches to both …There have been a lot of bugs that were fixed and other improvements for the mod version. I think once that is released that is it for the mod version. If you want fixes after that its the steam version you will want.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>The “retail” release or Steam version (yes, you will finally get to throw us some change) is is going to have upgrades, bug fixes, a multiplayer addon, and a port to a new engine. That said, because it is a steam version, this also means that any additional fixes or add ons after the initial launch can be done on the fly. No more sending you off to other websites to download patches or upgrade to newer versions. That is the beauty of Steam that we all appreciate.</li>
