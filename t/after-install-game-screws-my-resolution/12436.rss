    <title>After Install Game screws my resolution</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/after-install-game-screws-my-resolution/12436</link>
    <description>So after i downloaded/installed Black Mesa files using the installer AND downloading SDK base 2007&amp;2006 i checked the &#39;launch black mesa something something&#39; option.  my screen goes black, my monitor says resolution not supported.

i re-booted my PC, but on normal mode and safe mode they both get resolution not supported Even though i didn&#39;t launch the game.  my resolution got altered.  So after 2 more futile reboots (just for the fun of it :&#39;( ) i was able to get to my home screen on my PC.  In my steam library i see Black Mesa is in there.

I am wondering if anyone else got an issue like this: perhaps i should have just launched the game from steam?

My new problem after the previous event is that when i launch the game through steam the game instant crashes after 3 seconds in main menu screen (Before the blurry screen effect goes away).  And sometimes it crashes with...
