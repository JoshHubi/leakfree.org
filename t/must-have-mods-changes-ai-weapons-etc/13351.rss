    <title>Must have mods/changes (AI, weapons etc)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/must-have-mods-changes-ai-weapons-etc/13351</link>
    <description>Hi hi. Played BM when it first came out and I&#39;m gearing up to go through again.

Wondering what things have been developed since it came out. I&#39;m after a few things.

The HECU not being superhuman, more delayed, so you can actually ambush them. (Do they reload? I remember constant stream of pain when against them originally, no chance to really come out of cover).

The Vorts being a bit more interesting like in HL.

Houndeyes a bit more delayed in their attack. (I sortof miss the original attack sounds of them also).

And any other recomendations...

If anyone could point me to any mods that would get BM how i&#39;d like it or what values to alter in CFGs i&#39;d be really happy.</description>

<p>Yeah, I also disagree with the houndeye bit. Before, you had enough time to hear it, turn around and kill it no matter what, now you have juuust enough time to do that. Don’t miss the sound, either, as the new sounds help give BM its own feel.</p>
<p>But yeah, there’s only so much that can be changed without BM’s source code, which we don’t have, yet.</p>

</aside>
<p>I have to totally disagree with you, because I think the original sound is far superior and also the blast effects are not present.</p>
<p>You can try my sound mod if you like and add the shockwave blast particle effects from game banana by ysrael214.</p>
<p>For my sound mod google “BMS revamp sound mod” or “BMS soundskin” hope you like it.</p>
<p>you shall get what you are after.</p>

            <p>To suggest a few mods &gt;</p>
<ol>
<li>For vortigaunts</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://blackmesa.gamebanana.com/skins/126897" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Classic Vortigaunt Textures</a> with optional slower attack speed</li>
<li><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=17765" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HL 1 style Vortigaunt voices</a></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Regarding expansions</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-weve-got-hostiles-vent-mod" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">We’ve Got Hostiles - Vent Mod</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-on-a-rail-uncut" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">On a Rail Uncut</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-surface-tension-uncut/news/surface-tension-uncut-v20-released" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Surface Tension Uncut</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;-- These mods are very good, I highly recommend them.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>If you want Black Mesa to be more Half-Life-ish.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://blackmesa.gamebanana.com/guis/29614" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Half-Life 1 WON style menu</a><br>
Thanks to the talented Joel Nielsen, the music score of Black Mesa is pure awesomeness. Still, if you really want, you can download the original <a href="https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/half-life-original-soundtrack" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Half-Life’s soundtrack here</a> , and bring them into the game manually.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now I’m not using any of the following right now, but there are also some weapon skin and animation improving mods that you might want to check out <a href="https://blackmesa.gamebanana.com/skins" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here.</a>

            <p>The delay definately helped against the soldiers. Still I get killed often by there accuracy.</p>
<p>Shame i’ve now made the Vorts pretty easy.</p>

            <p>Personally I would like the Houndeyes a bit slower. imo they are meant to be fodder, it’s only in large groups that they are threatening. In BM, even one can chunk your health if you aren’t careful.</p>

            <p>I disagree with the houndeye bit, because they were fodder in the original but are an actual credible threat here.</p>
<p>As far as the HECU goes, there is a setting where you can change that for now.</p>
<p>ai_reaction_delay_alert “0.3”<br>
ai_reaction_delay_idle “0.75”</p>
<p>I believe you can type this into the console and it will save it. That, or it’s either skill.cfg or config.cfg that you can paste this into.</p>

            <p>I agree with houndeyes being too quiet. Can’t hear anything sometimes and getting blasted in the back. Either the houndeyes are too high pitched, or I have hearing damage becuase I can’t even hear cs1.6 footsteps anymore. What I get for forgetting my earplugs in the factory for one day.</p>
