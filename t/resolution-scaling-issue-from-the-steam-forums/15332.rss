[quote=keggerius]
I am using the launch options -windowed -w -h. This works perfectly for other Source games, but Black Mesa thinks my 3840x2160 monitor is 2560x1440 for some reason, so it scales the window up by a factor of 1.5. So if I use, for example, -w 1920 -h 1080, it gives me a 2880x1620 window, with a 1920x1080 resolution but with all the pixels scaled up to 1.5x pixels, making them look blurry. On a 4k monitor, this still isn&#39;t that bad looking, but it would be nicer to have 1-to-1 pixels. Is there some setting in the config files that will force the game to think the monitor is 3840x2160?

            <p>Ah, OK. I was about to post a follow up post saying to scratch my previous post as I figured out that it could be a DPI scaling issue.</p>
<p>For some reason, when you run Black Mesa in windowed mode, the window gets scaled (stretched) according to the scaling setting in Windows Display settings (including -noborder had no effect on this on my system).</p>
<p>There are two ways to work around this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the display scaling to 100%, or</li>
<li>Enable the “Override high DPI scaling behavior” setting in bms.exe Properties -&gt; Compatibility, and make sure “Scaling performed by:” is set to “Application”.</li>
</ol>

            <p>He figured it out after Chon replied. (simple as -noborder)<br>

            <p>Just a long shot, but ask the user to check if [tt]mat_viewportscale[/tt] is set to something other than “1.0”.</p>
<p>You’ll get a 1.5x upscaling if [tt]mat_viewportscale “0.666667”[/tt] and [tt]mat_viewportupscale “1”[/tt].</p>
<p>On a side note, [tt]mat_viewportscale[/tt] doesn’t work well with the December Beta update. Changing [tt]mat_viewportscale[/tt] messes up the new dynamic lighting engine, and the console gets spammed with “ERROR!! - Secondary View NewLights RT SIZE MISMATCH VIEWSIZE […]” error messages.</p>
<p>EDIT: I say long shot because I don’t think [tt]mat_viewportscale[/tt] will affect the size of the window, just the in-game rendering resolution.</p>
