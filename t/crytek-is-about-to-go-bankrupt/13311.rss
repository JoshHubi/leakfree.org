[QUOTE=dsogaming]
I know that a lot of PC gamers hate Crytek for what it did to the Crysis series but let’s face it; this studio had a lot of potential. And when we say a lot, we mean A LOT. German videogames magazine “Gamestar” has reported that Crytek is in big trouble and that it may go bankrupt.

According to Gamestar, the adoption of CRYENGINE is not going well and the word-of-mouth at GDC was negative. Strangely enough, CRYENGINE is currently one of the most optimized engines, so Crytek should really look into its subscription prices otherwise this amazing engine may never be used by other triple-A developers.

Not only that, but Gamestar claims that the development of Ryse was catastrophic for the studio. Just mere months before its release, the game was severely behind and Crytek was able to complete it with additional manpower. And from what we’ve seen thus far, Ryse did not sell as good as Crytek hoped (especially for a console exclusive).

Things are definitely not looking good for Crytek and while Avni Yerli claimed that a cash injection for the company is finally imminent (with a contract to be signed really soon), a lot of big publishers are waiting for a possible bankrupt in order to sign the talent and shop the IPs from Crytek.

For what is worth, Wargaming is listed as a possible buyer of Crytek. If Wargaming does buys Crytek, we can kiss goodbye to all of the studio’s single-player games (as Wargaming is best known for its Free-To-Play games). In short, this may be the end of the Crytek we knew.

But what has happened and the team is facing this major financial issues? According to Yerli, there were “dramatized rumors” from disgruntled ex-employers, something that obviously had a negative impact to Crytek’s public image. Additionally, Crytek has more than 800 employees (a number so huge that explains the company’s possible financial issues). Moreover, Gamestar reported that salaries were paid late and leading employees were sending applications to other studios at home and abroad. And if that wasn’t enough, Warface was only successful in Russia and Crytek’s G-face platform was a big flop.

In short, Crytek is currently in deep trouble and we don’t know whether the studio will be able to recover. And yes, PC gamers can now say to Crytek “We told you so, you had to keep Crysis exclusive to the PC and keep pushing the graphical boundaries.”

            <p>well, they had a stupid business model and now they pay for it. Tbh, I don’t even really care if they go bankrupt, sure their engine is pretty awesome and all, but the games they make are almost never very remarkable apart from their graphics fidelity. Kinda logical though, that company started as a graphics demo company. Especially their last couple of games were just plain boring/terrible. I mean I was never a big fan of Crysis all to much, but there was one thing I liked about it: the openess of the world. They totally shat on that with the sequels. Apart from that I never really got why they always had to add aliens/mutants. I liked both Far Cry and Crysis quite a lot, until the second half of the game where you had these non-sensical aliens/mutants.</p>
<p>What surprises me though is that they just can’t get their engine sold to studios all that much. Compared to UE it’s nothing in that regard. Even UE1 had more games based on it than any CE has. Is it the developer support? The content pipeline?</p>
<p>Well lets see what they will come up with, but I kind of doubt they’ll have a bright future for now.</p>

            <p>Cryengine is really pretty, and can be really impressive at times. I’ve done some cool stuff with it, myself. That said, although it would be real a shame to see such cool tech go, I personally wouldn’t miss it a huge deal…</p>

            <p>It would probably just die unless Crytek sells it to someone. I imagine there would be plenty of people willing to buy it (maybe, it’s not used for too many games so maybe nobody wants it) but even if that happens it will be developed by someone else then. I agree it would be sad if Cryengine just disappeared.</p>

            <p>So, uh, if Crytek does go under, what happens to Cryengine? Will it be released as open source? Become abandonware? Will the patent and source be sold to the highest bidder?</p>
<p>I’m not the biggest fan of it’s editing interface aside from the ability to drop in the game at any time and place, but it would still be sad to see it become deprecated.</p>
