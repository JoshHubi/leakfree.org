    <title>Red Double Doors Won&#39;t Open in Office Complex</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/red-double-doors-wont-open-in-office-complex/63161</link>
    <description>I&#39;m in Office Complex, I&#39;m at the part where you must dodge lasers to hit a green button to raise a forklift, then dive behind it to flip the switch to disable the lasers.  Success!  But then when I go up the stairs to open the red double doors, they don&#39;t open.  (Also, there is one Guard with me.)  I checked a YouTube video and the doors opened for them.  Did I miss a step somewhere??  Frustrating!</description>
