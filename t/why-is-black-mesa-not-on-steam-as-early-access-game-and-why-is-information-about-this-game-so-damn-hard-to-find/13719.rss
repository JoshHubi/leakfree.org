    <title>Why is Black Mesa not on Steam as &quot;Early Access Game&quot;? And Why is information about this game so damn hard to find ...</title>

    <description>When finished the developers stated the complete game will be released on Steam. 

Last I check on the status of this game (a few years ago) it was in the same development status. If things have changed I wouldn&#39;t know because I can&#39;t seem to find any updates or news. Sticky&#39;s on forums are not clear. Thousands of threads on forums show little coherent information. 

I want to know why this game simply isn&#39;t listed on Steam like any other game, or even Source mods where updates and status could be clear for all to see?

Even the fact it says this game was &quot;Released in 2012&quot; is very misleading. Its the incomplete version that was released. Even Wikipedia page for this game should probably be edited to clarify that in the status section.

So what gives? Why not show that status on Steam or something clear? At least then you won&#39;t get thousands of posts increasing the white noise on your forums. I mean are these questions annoying for both the developers and the fans waiting for the game? Fans don&#39;t know where to turn for info, and developers don&#39;t want to answer questions. Why not just put it where all other game developers do and be done with it!

At least then fans can add the game to their wishlist, and subscribe to it. This way they are notified of updates. 

Or maybe there is a really good reason why its not on Steam as Early Access Game...like it doesn&#39;t qualify cause it has no expected release date, or may not be finished, etc. 

I dunno. Just annoyed by the lack of info.</description>

            <p>I replied to this before but it got lost in the forum update somehow.</p>
<p>We’ll get you guys up to speed on the game’s development, relatively soon. And I don’t mean <span class="bbcode-b">SOON™</span>, I mean soon soon. Patience is a virtue, frienderinho. We’re working on it!</p>

            <p>Imagine if you had to answer this question every week…would you get annoyed? We are working…engine version changes introduce lots of problems especially when its done several times. I guess you completely missed my developer updates that went on all last year (all 17 parts). You will get to buy the game, just be patient.</p>

            <p>Is it really so hard to click on the subforum clearly labeled “Developer Updates” to get updates from the developers? Is that seriously so hidden?</p>
<p>That’s the majority of what there is updates on. Sometimes a devs will give a small tidbit here and there, but that’s hardly worth their time to update the wiki on.</p>

            <p>The final release is still under development.</p>
<p>ETA: When it’s Done.</p>
<p>P.S.: Not all game developers put their games on early access.  Have patience.  As a wise man once said, “You want something fast or you want something good?”</p>
<p>P.P.S.: There are multiple threads showing updates here on this forum.  Sorry there can’t be more information.  I’m sure you’ll like the finished product, however.</p>
