    <title>Game keeps quitting</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-keeps-quitting/13382</link>
    <description>Okay so I have got it to launch successfully through WineSkin... however, whenever I press any key on my keyboard when playing BM it just quits... almost as if I told it to quit so there aren&#39;t any errors or anything like that.

Please could someone help me out?

I am using a MacBook Pro with Retina Display (Early 2013) with OS X Yosemite Beta.</description>
