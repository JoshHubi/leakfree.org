    <title>Crash/Glitch Weapon issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-glitch-weapon-issues/11705</link>
    <description>Hey all,

     I was on my way to the lab when you&#39;re traveling outside. Right when you leave the facility and fight a bunch of guys you walk through a mini base. There was a loading issue which deleted all of my weapons, also put me into a FPS without the ability to see the weapon (when I picked up off of dead soldiers). I&#39;m not sure if the location is that important so I wont expand on that, unless someone asks.

     I just kept going on to see if it would fix itself through a loading screen or two, well, that and I was too immersed to worry about it. I got to a bunker, in which you pick up the rocket launcher ( first one I had found ). When firing the launcher the game crashes. The game also crashes when I try to fire the alternative of the sub machine gun (left click of the mouse). I can pick up grenades, but when I try to throw nothing happens.

     I&#39;m wondering if I should just re-download, or if there is an easy fix.

Thanks
