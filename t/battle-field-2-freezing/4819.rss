    <title>Battle Field 2 freezing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/battle-field-2-freezing/4819</link>
    <description>I reciently reinstalled BF2 on windows 7 32bit. I&#39;m having this problem with the game freezing or locking up during online play. The screen freezes and the audio loops, but after around 45sec to 1min it goes back to normal and I can play. This seems to happen randomly and is quite annoying and game breaking because I play the Project Reality mod and anything can happen in 1 min. Any help or recomendations would be appriciated, and yes my system can handle it so it&#39;s not that.</description>

<p>Yeah I got the problem fixed, turns out the Nvidia beta drivers were fucking it up, I just went back to a more stable version.</p>

<p>Lesson learned, never use beta drivers. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Amazingly enough, that was happening to me yesterday! I’m obsessed with the same mod, to boot  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I updated my nvidia driver and it made a world of difference. (I HATE how much they fuck up their drivers sometimes, but it does make for a satisfying feeling when they suddenly work reasonably. Like stepping into an air-conditioned room…).</p>
<p>There <em>have</em> been issues with some newer maps where they seriously do not work. In particular, that interesting looking one nobody plays because it feels smooth for a moment but after a few minutes It Kills Everyone’s Fracking Computer as they venture beyond main base. (And thus I can’t remember its name).</p>
<p>And, with that in mind, a note for the Black Mesa developers: Kittens like to graph frame rates, but the sharp points in their graphs KILL THEM. So, do it for the kittens  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yes, it never happens on other games, I’ve searched quite a bit, and other people also have this. My pc isn’t custom save for a new gpu. I have 3gb DDR2 RAM an AMD Athlon 5000+ and a GeForce 9600 GT OC edition. I currently have my 9600 underclocked to 550 Mhz core clock as this is said to solve this problem. I know my system isn’t fantastic, but it’s all I need at the moment, any more is pretty much overkill.</p>

            <p>You sure this only happens in Battlefield 2? Programs freezing with looping sound is known to be related with memory issues. If your system was custom built make sure that you have set the proper settings for your memory (timings, voltages etc.)</p>

            <p>This is strange I know, but I don’t have a hard drive light. I have recently done a defrag, and I’m pretty sure it’s not a har drive problem, I would check by alt-tabbing out and checking the processes, but my system goes into a total lock-up until the game resumes.</p>

            <p>That’s really weird.  Next time it happens, check to see if your hard drive light is on or not.  If it is, then it may be a program (BF2 or otherwise) going crazy and thinking as hard as it possibly can, which sends BF2 into a temporary freeze-up.</p>
