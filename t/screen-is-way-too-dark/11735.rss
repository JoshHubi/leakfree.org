    <title>Screen is way too dark</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/screen-is-way-too-dark/11735</link>
    <description>My game is running fine except for the fact that the first few levels in black mesa are extremely dark. Almost too dark to see, and the flashlight does little to light up the area. The game is borderline unplayable in some places despite having the brightness setting maxed out, as well as my screen brightness on full. Is there a quick fix to this problem?

Im running the game on a 2011 macbook pro with windows 7 ultimate.

Thanks!</description>

<p>I think I see your problem which sersoft was alluding to.  Your Macbook has “technology” that is rendering the screen too dark for the mod.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4035779?start=0&amp;tstart=0" data-bbcode="true">this thread</a> and <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/130819-analyzing-the-macbook-pro-with-retina-display" data-bbcode="true">this thread</a>.  It’s an issue with the way your Macbook’s screen is manufactured.  I don’t think that there’s going to be a solve except by having some other display hooked up to your Macbook (dunno if it’s possible).  It’s not a bug with the game.</p>
