    <title>Black Mesa won&#39;t launch on Windows 8 x64</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-wont-launch-on-windows-8-x64/11987</link>
    <description>I did a fresh install a few days ago, and it appears I can&#39;t play it through Steam now.
I&#39;ve googled, the admin trick doesn&#39;t work for me.
Let me know your solutions or settings if you&#39;re running on windows 8, thank you.</description>
