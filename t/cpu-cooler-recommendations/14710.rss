    <title>CPU cooler recommendations?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cpu-cooler-recommendations/14710</link>
    <description>My CPU has been overheating a lot lately. I&#39;m usually pretty good at keeping the heatsink free of dust, but it just starts happening again a lot faster than it should. All I can figure is that the fan on my heatsink is going out, or maybe the one that came with my CPU just isn&#39;t that great to begin with.
So, does anyone have any recommendations for a CPU cooler? I know it&#39;s easy to read reviews on high-rated products, but I prefer the more human responses a thread can inspire.  I&#39;ll basically be sold on any stories like &quot;since getting this cooler, my processor hasn&#39;t overheated once&quot;.
But God knows I can&#39;t afford a liquid cooling system right now, nor would I trust myself to install it without getting my entire computer wet somehow. So just air coolers.</description>

            <p>you can buy stand alone liquid coolers for each part of you can build a custom loop like I did. The options are limitless, and with radiators, you can get big ones, and put a fan on that is larger and quieter because the blades do not need to move as fast for a similar air flow</p>

            <p>Not risky at all, particularly with so many water cooling options to choose from nowadays. I have a Corsair H100i in my case and the CPU rarely goes over 35c, even in the hot country where I live.<br>
The radiators are smaller now too, so the size of the case is not as much as an issue as it used to be.</p>

I mean it makes sense, and it’s probably not that hard to make it.</p>

<p>You can get a small power supply that can run the pump while you test for leaks.  I have been running my game box for nearly 2 years without a hitch. The coolant is still blue with no sediment</p>

            <p>Just make sure your PC case has the fan power to extract the hot air inside the case.</p>
<p>That pretty big cooler is pointless if the air around it is hot.</p>
<p>I have a similar giant CPU Cooler, and my case has 7 fans in total.<br>
Two in front for sucking air in, and 2 on top and 3 on bottom for letting air out.</p>

            <p>OP, when you fit the new CPU cooler, make sure you remove the old paste from the CPU with a rag and a few drops of alcohol.<br>
It’s likely that the EVO will come with pre-applied thermal paste, at least in my experience, so it will need a good, clean surface to sit on.</p>

<p>I just found a use for an extremely old and tiny heat sink for a CPU, and reused it to cool the back plate for the VRM of my graphics card. It removed those artifacts I was getting at a higher overclock. Now I’m wondering what would happen if I put the waterblock for a CPU onto the back plate of this GPU that I own.</p>

</aside>
<p>Doesn’t seem like a good idea to me at all.</p>
<p>The benefits would be close to none since the backplate usually isn’t in direct contact with anything.</p>
<p>I believe if you do this you run a high risk of creating condensation since there is a gap between the GPU PCB and backplate, i am almost willing to bet condensation will occur, i don’t think you want water on your GPU.</p>

<p>Man, I hope you have a lot of money to toy around with. I’d never risk damaging computer components for the sake of experimentation without a guaranteed means of replacement.</p>

<p>After replacing the stock cooler with a Noctua on my first ever build it cut my temps generally 20 to 25 degrees. The NH-D14 to be specific. Its a cumbersome (as in large) cooler but I’ve never seen the temperature rise beyond 60 degrees under load since I installed it. I think they have more compact cooler models but I’ve never personally used them. The cooler master hyper 212 evo would be my second choice as noctua are a bit pricey. The D14 barely fits my case so be sure about your dimensions before doing anything.</p>

<p>Noctua NH-U14S here, and it’s a good cooler too!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>By the way, any cooler will succumb to a problem where eventually the thermal paste will dry up and be less effective. Even on water cooling sadly. As for me, I kept my after market air cooling tower because there are no real tangible benefits of overclocking an Intel Core i7 4790K above <span class="mention">@4.5</span> GHz. After that clock rate, the thermals and power required are outrageous, with very little gain.</p>
<p>If you want to water cool, and have some money for it, do it on your graphics card and overclock the snot out of it, that will give you real benefits.</p>

<p>Corsair Vengeance C70. It’s a hell of a lot larger and better than my old Thermaltake.</p>
