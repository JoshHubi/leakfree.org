    <title>SMOD Total Redux</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/smod-total-redux/12195</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m working on a fixed and fully working version of Smod Redux 8. This good mod does not deserve such a painful death so I am bringing it back. I have fixed most installation issues and made patches for certain crashes. I&#39;m happy to say it runs well with the acceptance of only 2 super annoying crashes. 

But I want to make this mod a little bit more cooler. 20 custom weapons is pretty awesome but I would like to add some custom Combine NPC&#39;s and Replace some Combine NPC models. Right now I want to replace and I need someone to teach me how or make their own models to help me with this. I don&#39;t know how hammer works or GCFscape or VTFscape and what I need replacement on is the color tinted Combine soldiers. You see in Nightmare difficulty Smod will randomly spawn Cops and Soldiers with red and blue tints meaning their AI is superior compared to normal enemies and their health is stacked. What I would like to do with these NPC&#39;s is replace their models or retexture them. Like for example I want the Red tinted metro cop to instead have the Trenchcoat model or simply have his white accents and arm bands red. 

If anyone can fill me in on how to do this or if you have spare time to do it yourself that would be great.

If you do do it yourself all credit will be given to you  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>I know but this is really just to get rid of the rouge soldier model and make it an elite force of rebels. Right now I’ve gone through some changes for the art now that im getting a little better at modeling.</p>
<p>Now they have a really modified CP helm, to give you an idea sorta like banes gas mask but combine looking and wearing goggles. They have the regular rebel get up but with some extra padding from some soldier armor.</p>
<p>Later on I might be making these like the HECU, being able to travel in hazardous environments and take some heavy damage.</p>
<p>PS- Thinking about putting in crab and mortar synths.</p>

            <p>In all actuality, it makes much more sense for the defective cops to use the citizen blue underclothes than the CP stuff, because it identifies them to other rebels. Otherwise, you’re being shot at by your own side. The metrocops aren’t actually wearing much armor other than their vests, the rest looks to mostly just be a cloth uniform.</p>

</aside>
<p>I am deviating a bit from the wiki and story line to help make more sense. Also yes I know the rebels are basically the cops but rouge cops in the full cop get up would make more sense as they would have more protection this way than the regular rebel look. Also I have had some change of plans while I was messing around with it, there will be still the regular rebels but there will be some random spawns of Elite rebels in the Cop outfit that I described. That said these Elite Rebels will appear in Nightmare mode along with the Elite and Ace soldiers.</p>

<p>Sorta. For now they will have rebel AI but later on I will give them a friendly improved soldier AI with much better precision and reaction time. But first I need to find out how to implement the Blue Soldier AI to the rebel Cops.</p>

<p>Thank you and I was thinking the same things since the NPC’s in smod spawn on a modified spawn node. In nightmare mode random spawn nodes are placed meaning either a number of enemies could be there/Elite or Ace NPC’s. Theres even a node gun you can give yourself to edit the nodes. Idk how they are saved but I heard it was through the console.</p>
<p>Anyway a few days ago I gave the Red tinted soldiers the shot gunner model thanks to some help from the fellow above with the link. But the tint still remained so yes I am thinking it’s the maps coding.</p>
<p>I’ll look into it soon. still figuring out the whole hammer thing and the VTF and the GFC editors.</p>
