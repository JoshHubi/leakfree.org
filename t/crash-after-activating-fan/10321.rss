    <title>Crash after activating fan</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-after-activating-fan/10321</link>
    <description>First of all, there is a topic on the &quot;Help!&quot; sub-forum, but I&#39;m posting here because it is a crash. It always happens after I activate the fan, then up the ladder. It says that &quot;hl2.exe&quot; has stopped working&quot;. I&#39;m on Windows 8, but I don&#39;t think this is the problem because there are others reporting the same thing and it&#39;s the first area that crashes. Also, I tried to start on a compatibility mode for Windows 7 for the Source SDK&#39;s  &quot;hl2.exe&quot;.

Specs:

Intel i7 2600k
ATI Radeon 7970 (drivers up-to date, as well as DirectX)
16 GB RAM

            <p>Thanks for the reply, I did try what I thought was everything in the room to no avail.</p>
<p>However, I tried again this evening and removed everything, and I mean everything; head crabs, pallets, anything in the room that could be interacted with. I activated the fan and sprinted back up the ladder before full power and I didn’t crash.</p>
<p>I am unsure whether removing every object and a physics engine related crash is to blame or the ladder, I am inclined to think it is a physics engine bug, that as others have pointed out, crashes when applying physics with the fan at full power.</p>

            <p>i had this problem too.<br>
there’s two things i tried, and im not sure which one fixed it.</p>
<p>but first off, make sure that ANY wood boxes, or palettes are completely destroyed and any of the pieces that wont destroy, throw them into the bottom of the pit. also drop the two propane tank kinda looking things into the bottom of the pit too.</p>
<p>The second thing that apparently helps, is getting back to the top floor before the bug occurs (which apparently happens when the fan hits full speed/power.) so you’re gonna have to race up as soon as you have hit the button.</p>
<p>hope this helps. it was very frustrating but this worked for me and i was able to continue the game.</p>

            <p>I am running Windows 7 64bit and am experiencing the same problem, destroying crates hasn’t helped, as soon as the fan powers up my client crashes ‘hl2.exe has stopped working’. I’ve attached two crash dumps.<br>

            <p>Windows 8 is garbage and the drivers that are available are in no way drivers that are suitable for playing games. How is anyone supposed to help you troubleshoot when you aren’t running an OS that is yet suitable for gaming of any kind…</p>
<p>Those are ‘proof of concept’ drivers… on a ‘proof-of-concept’ operating system.</p>

            <p>This happened to me too, it has something to do with how the wooden boxes and pallets react to the shift of gravity, before switching on the fan, make sure all the boxes and wooden pallets are destroyed and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>This was the only time the game had crashed on me.</p>

<p>Mmmm,I remember that I was always seeing to wall and stairs, never to fan, and  waited upstairs until the fan was the max power (sorry for my english:[)  Maybe, it’s a solution??</p>
