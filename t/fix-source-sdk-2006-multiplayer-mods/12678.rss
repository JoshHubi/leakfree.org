    <title>[Fix] Source SDK 2006 Multiplayer mods</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fix-source-sdk-2006-multiplayer-mods/12678</link>
    <description>If people have been getting problems connecting to servers using mods that use the SDK and keep getting &quot;Steam Validation required&quot; as an error when trying to connect to a public server, it&#39;s because Valve screwed up the Source SDK 2006 this afternoon trying to convert it to Steam Pipe.

By some miracle I managed to keep my old GCF files. Some people seem to be getting issues, so I put together a little kit and a readme (simple mind you) do your best to spread the word around if you don&#39;t mind.

This one is temporarily disabled because of the volume of traffic: [url]https://www.dropbox.com/s/gvp1xttqu0i94n6/Keep%20me%21.rar[/url]

Updated readme: [url]https://www.dropbox.com/s/cakkzsbq0p4w8bh/Keep%20me!.rar[/url]

Download this and disable automatic updates on the tool. (look at the readme) Happy fragging.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD THIS IF SERVERS THAT RUN ON THE MOD HAVE BEEN UPGRADED.

Server owners:

From now on, servers need to be installed using [url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD]SteamCMD[/url] with [url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Application_IDs]appid[/url] 205 (Source Dedicated Server).

That&#39;s about it. The above statement is from another server owner.

Edit: If you can&#39;t access the link do the following steps:
You need to uninstall both SDKs. 2006/2007
Then install 2007 First.
Once you do that, install 2006, let it dawdle.
Then delete the &quot;cache&quot; once it should remain on the list, and your installation should be rolled back.</description>

            <p>Good god.</p>
<p>Alright, like I said, if the link doesn’t work follow these steps:<br>
Go to tools on your Steam library<br>
You need to uninstall both SDKs. 2006/2007<br>
Then install 2007 First.<br>
Once you do that, install 2006, let it dawdle.<br>
Then delete 2006 <span class="bbcode-b">once</span> if you did everything right, it should remain on the list, and your installation should be rolled back.</p>
<p>MAKE SURE YOU DISABLE AUTOMATIC UPDATES.</p>
<p>Note: Once the servers get updated to the new format, you need to update your client again anyway 'cause you’ll get the same error.</p>
<p>Farther, this fix worked for several people, you need to add the files while steam is shut down.</p>

            <p>Found a fix myself now. Probably the same as yours. So I’ll upload my own old SDK files and provide with instructions as well. A friend of mine tried it and it worked for him. I’ll provide a link as soon as the upload is done.</p>

<p>This is one with an updated readme. I missed a step in my last one. You need to add the files while steam’s shut down.</p>
<p>I’d suggest dlin’ Dropbox yourself and encourage people to do the same, or put it on a torrent or some shit. You’ve got my permission to do that.</p>

<p>Would love to, man, but again I got here too late and it’s shut down due to high trafic. I’ll wait here all day now until you’ve provided a new link, so I can help with more dropbox folders.</p>

<p>Damn we need more Dropbox links for this, since it’s closed caused by too much traffic. I’ll provide more links if I can get the original content.</p>
