    <description>Hi,

I want to make a mod, but that isn&#39;t important now. For that I need to know how to adjust some values. I made a discussion in the steam forums, and I got some help, but I still have a question.

In the skill.cfg you can adjust how much damage you do and how much damage enemies do to you, how much you get from medkits and batteries and the amount of ammo you can carry for each gun (and a lot more).
What you can&#39;t do there is adjust how much you get from ammo pickups. Is there a way? Is there a way to adjust the starting ammo when first picking up a weapon?

Thanks.</description>

<p>If it’s not in the ammo pick-up values, it’s probably hard-coded. I’m not sure, but I’ll check.</p>
<p>EDIT: Nope, not in hammer. So  you’re stuck with the defaults for now. I’ll talk with a programmer and see how big of a task it would be to expose this value.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a survival mode with a singleplayer map designed for that, but also make that mode available for the main game. It should be like Ranger Mode in the Metro games. You have way less ammo for everything, and you find less ammo in the levels, enemies do way more damage BUT you also do more damage. I think that would make a cool spin to the game for people like me who completed the campaign mulitple times (and HL1 100 times)<br>
And the ammo thing is the most important for this to work. I could still make it work when I make my own map designed for that, but one .357 ammo box will still give 6 bullets which is way too much for this to work. I want to hide ammo everywhere in the level, the player should have to scavenger the **** out of everything and if he misses a shot it will have consequences for him.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the answer. Maybe you could make it possible to change that with the next big update or so? Please  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I don’t believe there’s a way to adjust starting pickup from ammo, I think thats hard coded. Never did it myself, so I’m not 100% sure.</p>
<p>Though, good idea for a potential modding thing, being able to affect (effect?) pick-up ammo for a weapon.</p>
