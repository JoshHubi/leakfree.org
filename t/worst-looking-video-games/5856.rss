    <title>Worst Looking Video Games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/worst-looking-video-games/5856</link>
    <description>as compared to other video games of their year.

I can&#39;t really think of any recent games. Except maybe Halo Reach and it&#39;s TERRIBLE texture quality at any distance greater than 5 meters (this may just be a problem in splitscreen).

Any other ideas?</description>

            <p>The Stalker games look pretty good and they’re… kind of based on a film  :rolleyes:  .</p>
<p>At least with the Complete mods. Though I think CoP looks pretty darn good.</p>

<p>Ahh, but the Wii rarely ever tries to compete with the other consoles. The majority of the first party games for the Wii are more interested in gameplay than in pushing the envelope.</p>
<p>I agree that the highest graphics on the PS3 kill the highest graphics on the Wii but that’s really not what the Wii is about.</p>

<p>Half-Life: Source<br>
One game that Valve really dropped the ball on. Yeah, it’s Half-Life. Yeah, It uses the Source Engine. The thing that staggers me is that it was released by Valve. You’d think they’d go all-out on the source re-make of the video game that basically put them on the map.<br>
I guess that’s why we’re here though amiright, guys?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I know this is late and you’re probably trolling but whatever<br>
the reason valve ported half-life to source was just for that reason, to present that they can easily port a game from an older engine to the newer one, never was it a plan to remake the game</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s not that Wii games don’t have good graphics it’s that Nintendo really doesn’t concentrate on good graphics. I’m not talking about ports here. I mean look at Kirby’s Epic Yarn. Nintendo accomplished what they wanted to do with graphics without trying to make it 100% realistic. That’s like saying Tetris doesn’t have good graphics because it doesn’t look like Metro 2033. They’re not really comparable. You could however point out, as you have, that BO on the Wii doesn’t have good graphics. But saying every Wii game is idiotic.</p>

            <p>You’re right, all wii games look like shit to me but Nintendo traded detailed graphics for an innovative control system. That seems fair enough imho. Hardcore gamers can stick with PCs while casual gamers have fun in their living rooms (no innuendo intended).</p>

<p>True, but it might be because they had used the CoD4 engine tech on World At War, and started Black Ops before MW2 was finished. That or the dismemberment technology was exclusive to their version of the engine. Somewhat like how Splinter Cell Conviction was technically running on the Unreal Engine 2 (alibet HEAVILY modified). It also could be that the dev team wanted to stick to what they were familiar with. But agreed, everyone would buy it no matter how shitty it looks. Why? Because it’s Call of Duty and it’s generally going to be a quality product despite it’s annualization by Bobby Fucking Kotick.</p>

I saw a trailer for the zombiemode today, and I have to say, while the characters look pretty good, (Reasonable facsimiles of the people they’re modeled after) the animation, both regular and facial, is atrociously bad. And I’m pretty sure they did Motion Capture, too, which makes the fact that they’re so bad even worse.</p>

            <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops</p>
<p>It still uses the same engine from the first Modern Warfare, the shadow density is very low. They still use BSP to create most of the level geometry instead of meshes. Most textures are low-res 512x512. The models are very low poly. No physics on models with proper collision, static model collision is made using BSP. Dynamic lighting with high quality shadows is also very limited from what I remember in Modern Warfare.</p>
<p>I don’t know why they do it, either time is not on their side and they can’t afford a proper upgrade or they don’t bother changing the engine seeing how it’s used to create very fast paced games and nobody will really stand still and look at something close-up for long. Even so, it’s far behind other game engines like the Unreal engine.</p>
