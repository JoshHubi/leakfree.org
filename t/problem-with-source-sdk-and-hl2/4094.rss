    <title>Problem with Source SDK and HL2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-with-source-sdk-and-hl2/4094</link>
    <description>Hi everyone

So, yesterday, I&#39;ve learned how to create maps using the Hammer - followed all the steps of the Souce website. The first map was ok - it had the textures and a total of 12 entities (8 zombies, 1 vortigaunt, 1 shotgun and 2 boxes of shotgun ammo) without counting the player&#39;s start point (the &quot;green gordon&quot;). After inspecting the connections of the brushes, I&#39;ve compiled and it ran great.

The problem was the 2nd map.
The only new things I&#39;ve put there was a total of 16 lights (3 groups -1 white, intensity 800; 6 red, intensity 100; and 9 yellow, intensity 50), two static and one dynamic prop, and a door, besides the other entities, like civilians with weapons, 2 vortigaunts and a zombie army behind the door.
Half-Life crashed every time I tried to run this second map. I agree that, for a second map, I put too many things, but I don&#39;t know about mapping too much to find the problem  :slight_smile: 

I already deleted the map, but if someone shows interest, I can remake it without problem.

OBS: To make this maps, I&#39;ve downloaded the Souce SDK, Source SDK Base, Source from Orange Box, Half-Life 2 and Ep. 1.</description>

            <p>Thanks again, guys.<br>
I am making a new map now, and, when it’s done, I will show it for you.<br>
OBS: show on the right thread.</p>

            <p>So far, I haven’t seen any documentation on what “Unique” does, and to do what Katana said, in the compile window, before you press run, set “VRAD” and “VVIS” to none.</p>

            <p>Guys, I’ve just solved the problem. When choosing the type of the npc entities, I’ve put one as “Unique”. It was that who was crashing Half-Life, but not anymore.<br>
By the way, what is this “Unique” type of the npc_citizen entity?</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/savant">@Savant</a>: I didn’t run it on HDR. The only thing I did was placing the props and entities as it was on the Valve website (<a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SDK_Docs" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SDK_Docs</a>), but placing more things</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/katana">@Katana</a>: I’m new about making maps. How do I do to make the modifications your are saying?</p>
<p>Thanks guys</p>

            <p>Well, if there’s a suspicion that it’s a lighting problem, you could have it ONLY run BSP, without VRAD or VVIS. It’s what I do with the BM maps when I just want to test entity logic without compiling all the lighting.</p>

            <p>Odd, the map crashes for me too, and I can’t find a reason for it.</p>
<p>Try adding a few cubemaps and info_nodes, maybe that solves the problem. Maybe you rendered it in HDR without any HDR enabled skybox, and without cubemaps. Try visiting <a href="https://www.interlopers.net" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Interlopers</a> if all else fails, they have a bunch of good tutorials which should put you on the right track</p>

            <p>He already compiled the second map.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can only assume that something overflowed hl2.exe (brushwork, leaks, or a great rendering time of models) which caused it to crash.</p>

            <p>Maps should not crash on such small entity numbers, and seeing that there are not so much props, you must have overdid the brush geometry or something even worse. Would you mind taking a few shots of the VMF or even upload it here so the people around here can look at it and identify the problem?</p>
