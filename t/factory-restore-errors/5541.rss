            <p>Russilker has the short answer for you.</p>
<p>A slightly longer answer - STOP USING THE COMPUTER!  In the odd chances that any of his data is still intact, it will floating around the hard drive marked for deletion.  This means that any time the system needs to write something to disk, it will choose Marked files before using free space on the drive.</p>
<p>If you, he, or someone you know is technical enough, pull the hard drive from the computer, hang it in another system and run something like <a href="https://www.piriform.com/recuva" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Recuva</a>, doing a deep scan for all file types.  If you must leave the drive in the system, load Recuva onto that system and ONLY run that scan; do not load any other software.  That’s one of your best chances for getting data back.  If the factory restore zeroed the drive, well, he’s SOL and JWF.</p>

<p>I assume there’s formatting going on in the process of restoration, but seeing as how data was probably written over much of the formatted partition your chances of recovery are slim.</p>
