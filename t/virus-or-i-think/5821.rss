    <title>Virus! ( or i think..)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/virus-or-i-think/5821</link>
    <description>Ok so I have been having some strange problems lately. My MSN account on itself seems to keep sending messages to my and my friends in chinese/japanese with a strange link. Everybody was like what the hell dude why do you keep sending so I needed to get rid of it ASAP. I made a full scan with avast! and it found like 113 infected files. I tried to delete them. Doesn&#39;t work. I try to move them to chest. Doesn&#39;t work. The only thing avast! says is that it is a compression bomb or something like that. Does anyone know a way how to clean this up?</description>

            <p>Hi Hassmat,</p>
<p>I see that you’ve posted on the Spybot forum.</p>
<p>It seems that the forum is pretty busy at the moment, so it could be a day or two before the tech guys can get back to you.</p>
<p>They may even be working on it right now, so don’t worry that your being ignored. (Maybe they’re having difficulty in finding a Chinese translator.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> )</p>

            <p>As I posted in a previous virus infection thread, after you install Spybot-Search and Destroy, pay a visit to the Spybot Safer-Networking Malware Removal Forum and ask for help there.</p>
<p><a href="https://forums.spybot.info/forumdisplay.php?f=22" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.spybot.info/forumdisplay.php?f=22</a></p>
<p>Follow “BEFORE YOU POST” sticky instructions, and start a new thread with a full description of the problems you’re having and the staff guys there will tell you exactly how to completly remove all infections from every part of your system.</p>
<p>They’ll give you detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do this, including links to any additional anti-malware programs you might need to install to complete the cleaning process.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>

<p>I had this same problem. Twice with two different email accounts. One I never used anymore. I changed the password on both and haven’t had a problem since. It really is that simple. The infected files could be spyware, run a spybot sweep and it should take care of those. I run Avast and spybot and my computer survives just fine. I also just visit sites that I know are safe so that could help. When ever I do hit a problem a quick sweep in Windows safe mode with spybot fixes it quickly. Avast prevents all other viri from hitting my computer just fine.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok so spyware you say? I shall try that. Oh and I changed my password but it didn’t do any good. Fucker also managed to change my secret question and stuff. Don’t know if this can identify what it is but this happened: it even sends those messages to myself when I’m online.</p>
<p>edit: is the program called spybot-S&amp;D?</p>

            <p>The only problem is that the spambot knows all of your contacts, so the only way to stop the infection is for every person in that list to change their email.</p>

            <p>Although your virus scanner did find infected files, it doesn’t necessarily mean your problem is one of those infected files. It seems more like someone hacked your MSN account and is sending stuff from it. Change your MSN password, it should solve the problem. Another way to check is to see whether messages get sent while your computer is turned off. If yes, then the problem is in the account being hacked and not your computer.</p>
<p>As for getting rid of the viruses, ask Avast where the hell the files are. Then go find them manually, and delete them manually. If they’re locked, do it though Command Prompt. If it doesn’t work, note down the file locations, boot into DOS and delete the files manually from the command line. Or boot into safe mode and run Avast from there if you can.</p>

            <p>Ok so I have been having some strange problems lately. My MSN account on itself seems to keep sending messages to my and my friends in chinese/japanese with a strange link. Everybody was like what the hell dude why do you keep sending so I needed to get rid of it ASAP. I made a full scan with avast! and it found like 113 infected files. I tried to delete them. Doesn’t work. I try to move them to chest. Doesn’t work. The only thing avast! says is that it is a compression bomb or something like that. Does anyone know a way how to clean this up?</p>
