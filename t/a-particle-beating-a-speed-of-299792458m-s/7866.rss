    <description>Lately, yesterday, or today, there&#39;s a report that somebody has detected a particle moving over the speed of light!

o ma gawdd!

<p>I’m still not sure that anyone involved in the project said the particle is travelling faster than light. It simply has been stated that it arrived sooner than light would have if it travelled the full distance. So it’s the travel time that has been monitored. Not the speed. You can probably get such a result by altering the space travelled through. We know that space can be warped, so isn’t it more likely that space was warped somehow, rather than one of the fundamental laws of nature were broken?</p>

</aside>
<p>One of the most popular explanations right now is that the satellite that the two labs used to sync their clocks didn’t account for relativistic effects; ie, the satellite is in orbit around the Earth, so to it, the two labs appeared to be moving across the surface of the Earth below it.</p>

            <p>Science isn’t about “Why”, it’s about “Why not?”  You ask: Why is so much of our science dangerous?  I say: Why not marry safe science if you love it so much?  In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won’t hit you on the butt on the way out because YOU ARE FIRED!  Not you, test subject.  You’re doing fine.  You!  Yes, you!  Box.  Your stuff.  Door.  Parking lot.  Goodbye.</p>
<p>Alright, this next test may involve trace amounts of time travel.  So, word of advice: If you meet yourself on the next testing track, don’t make eye contact.  Lab boys tell me that’ll wipe out time.  Entirely.  Forward and backward.  So, do both of yourselves a favor and let that handsome devil go about his business.</p>

            <p>I guess I really should start using smileys since you guys didn’t understand that it was a joke.</p>
<p>But to be death serious like you guys, I would say that time traveling would be impossible or atleast we wouldn’t notice if it happend.<br>
Let’s say that we had time travel technology and we wanted to travel back a week to change something. As soon as we leave the future that we came from it would dissappear because we already changed the course of time. This leading me into teleportation. It would be impossible because to be able to move something from one place to another in time and space it would need the object(We, a ball, a tree) to dissolve and then send the atomic structure data to the other location and rebuild it. This would probably work for inanimated objects but who know what would happen with a living creature? It may work but it could also end up as a dead body or a disquisting smear on the ground. But this is just my opinion.</p>
<p>OK, we stop there before we get too off topic.</p>

            <p>Hmmm?<br>
Let me put some equation here, can’t I?<br>
Time equation of relativity said:<br>

<p>It says time can be extended (slower) if <span class="bbcode-b">v</span> is larger.<br>
So someone may think if v&gt;c the time will go in the opposite direction.<br>
You can try substituting <span class="bbcode-b">v</span> to be larger than <span class="bbcode-b">c</span>, so that<br>

            <p>No, it would just get somewhere faster then it should.</p>
<p>If you sent something like you would on the internet, the latency would be much less then what it is now.</p>

            <p>Well you see if the particle is moving faster than light we’ll have to find a way to transfer data with it. If we can do that, it could send the data back in time. Relatively speaking.</p>

            <p>It has been an age of Quantum Physics for ages.</p>
<p>I’m merely glad the current model will be tested and revised with this new discovery which could to lead to massive changes in the fundamental laws, mainly, the law of reletivity.</p>

            <p>A new test has been done (this time with very short beam pulses for better time measurement) and the particles were apperently still moving faster than light. <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">One</span> potential source of systematic error has now been ruled out</span>. Further testing is required to rule out other possible errors. The Opera experiment will continue to take data with a new muon detector <span class="bbcode-b">well into next year</span>, to improve the accuracy of the results.</p>
<p>CERN official update 18/11 :</p>
<p>“This test confirms the accuracy of OPERA’s timing measurement, ruling out one potential source of systematic error. The new measurements do not change the initial conclusion. Nevertheless, the observed anomaly in the neutrinos’ time of flight from CERN to Gran Sasso still needs further scrutiny and independent measurement before it can be refuted or confirmed.”</p>
