    <title>Anyone else think the HEV suit sleeves look ugly?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anyone-else-think-the-hev-suit-sleeves-look-ugly/14832</link>
    <description>If you don&#39;t know what I mean, i&#39;m talking about the first person arms. I personally think they look kinda ugly and... plastic? I know that there&#39;s a workshop addon that replaces them with an HD styled version, but It would be nice to see the vanilla model of the suit look a bit more... gritty, I guess. Of course, this is just a small nitpick I have with the game, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Does anyone feel the same way I do?</description>

            <p>I wouldn’t have made the HD version if I didn’t. ^~^<br>
It’s definitely one of the more jarring viewmodels, what with the “golf ball” pocks and a texture that appears far lower resolution than it actually is. I think the biggest problem with it is that it seems to emulate the HL2 arm a little which is just in my opinions the uglier design.</p>
