    <title>Something to Drop on that First Grunt</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/something-to-drop-on-that-first-grunt/13486</link>
    <description>When the first grunt is encountered, I see that there are controls connected to a very big cargo box over the grunt. I&#39;ve tried activating them, but I can&#39;t make it drop on him. 

Is it possible to make it drop on him, or was the implementation not considered by the mod team?</description>

            <p>I’d totally go add that right now, but I don’t want to fix up what decompilation breaks.</p>

            <p>When I first played that section, I tried pressing the green-glowing button, but nothing happened. It would be interesting if you could drop it on him.</p>

            <p>The box is static, you can’t do anything with it. Interestingly enough though, one of the ropes seems to be parented to a non-existent “drop_crate.” I could just be silly, but that combined with the environment setup makes it seem like it was possible or considered at one time, but wasn’t implemented or got cut for whatever reason.</p>
<p>You <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> drop some lead on 'him, though. :freeman:</p>
