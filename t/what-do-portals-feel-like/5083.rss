    <title>What do portals feel like?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-do-portals-feel-like/5083</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been wondering about this for some time now. What do you guys think? I wanna know what you all think an orange portal feels like when you touch it without a blue portal, and the particle effect around it. And maybe if you do go though one you get this weird feeling inside, referring to the sound you make when you pass though one. Leave your opinion!</description>

            <p>Honestly, in the context of the game, I don’t think you’re supposed to feel anything, since you walk through these portals like you’re walking through an open door.</p>
<p>I imagine, tho, that an entry portal without an exit portal would feel a bit tingly with all those particles.</p>

<p>You sir, are a genius. On Topic: My guess would be without the second portal it would feel extremely hot. Solid, too. With it, i think going through it would probably feel like all your organs adjusted about 1-11/2 in. to the right.</p>

            <p>I always imaged that going through one would make your whole body completely numb, with a very severe tingle to it. And touching an empty one would just feel like touching a wall but tingling. I’ve never been creative when it came to this type of stuff…</p>

            <p>You need to heat up the portal so hot, that the particles around it melts from each other and travel at the speed of light to another surface of the same type… and at the end all your particles comes together in just the right spot O_o I guess.</p>
<p>To be honest, I prefer the game…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit:</span><br>
If you take hydrogen through the portal, you will create clean nuclear power!</p>

            <p>Hmm… i would think it would feel like a gelatinous fluid, closely resembling jello, or goo.</p>
<p>And it must be hella weird to go through one d: maybe like butterflies in your stomach?</p>
