    <title>Google Wave</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/google-wave/3094</link>
    <description>Have any of you actually worked with Google Wave? How have you found it? 

Im thinking of starting to use it with the teams i work with but moving away from the conventional emails is a very big change for a lot of people. Is it actually useful or more of a bother to use?

If you dont know what google wave is, [b][url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDu2A3WzQpo&#39;]this video[/url][/b] should cover the basics.</description>

<p>Its off topic, but you have an awesome name. :3</p>
<p>Anyways this wave thing looks pretty good, and its nice to see google doing something with their huge amounts of money, but this Buzz thing I just don’t like. Its just Facebook, for google, and I would have gotten a Facebook account if I really wanted it.</p>
<p>bscly:<br>
Google Wave = Yes<br>
Buzz            = No</p>

            <p>Indeed.  I wouldn’t use Google for anything that I wanted to keep confidential.  However, I use Wave for collaborative research at the university I am studying at, and it excels for that purpose.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree that there are tools that companies can invest in for their communications that are better suited and confidential. However, for work like Lolipopman and seth mentioned it has the potential to save a lot of time.</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments, its good to get some feedback.</p>
<p>Another question. Those who have worked with Google Wave and a SVN client, which of the two has been the most beneficial and why?</p>

            <p>It’s a pointless solution for a problem that doesn’t even exist.</p>
<p>A simple combination of a common server and Outlook/Entourage is more than enough to keep a perfect mail-and-document history. People (and especially companies) have no business in using an online tool (by Google, so potentially unsafe as well) that resembles something of a downsized forum/chatbox.</p>
<p>That said, Google is aimng their arrows at way too many markets, and they’re making powerful enemies by doing so. If they keep it up this way, I won’t be surprised if they go bankrupt in 2-3 years. Though I think they’d rather quit with these pointless things (Android, Wave and Buzz) and keep doing the things they were doing “right”.</p>

            <p>I use GoogleWave.  It is an excellent tool for collaboration.  Unless you work in a group that constantly needs to be in contact and know what changes have been made to a document throughout it’s history, then GoogleWave is really really overkill.  A simple IM or Email might work best.</p>

            <p>I have a google wave account, but I dont have any friends who are really tech savvy enough to help me test it out. I tried getting google to get some accounts out to my school for more technology integration, but I haven’t gotten a reply back yet. If anyone wants to help test it out, go ahead and add me, maybe we can start a  Black Mesa wave.<br>
