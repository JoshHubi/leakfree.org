    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/onlive-gaming-on-the-cloud/8184</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not really sure if there already was a topic for this, but oh well. This service is actually very great, I have no problems with it at all(the only problem I have is with my ISP) The quality of the games and streaming is great, little to no input lagg. I have bought 3 games Assassin&#39;s Creed Revelations, Saints Row the Third, and Lego Batman.

    Assassins Creed plays great, I was actually lucky enough to pre-order a copy and recieve a free OnLive Gaming Console. I have two problems with the game, numero uno ~ It is like friggin&#39; impossible to play with kb/m (If your good at using it for AC games then I give you some props, I prefer using a controller)
numero dos ~ There aren&#39;t many people online in multiplayer (I with more people would play on this service or something, it&#39;s really great.)

    The graphics on all games are good as long as you have a good internet upload/download speed.  
Custom Graphics Scale I made up:

3mb/s = Minimum Graphics and Performance (Me It still looks and plays good/fast)

4-8mb/s = Medium Graphics and Performance (This is pretty much perfect/great little to no blurry screen 99% of the time)

9+mb/s = Maxxed Out (seriously no worries, no blur, no lag, just as if you were to run it from your home PC.


         The console is pretty awesome, It has a chargeable wireless controller, and it also works with a Xbox 360 controller. I haven&#39;t tried m/kb yet, but will in the future. The part I hate is that the only port out is HDMI. It&#39;s small and compact, you can bring pretty much anywhere. The controler is pretty nice, like a mix of Xbox, PS3. It has 2 USB ports for local multiplayer (not many local games available right now. 

You can even play on your android phone or tablet(some games) and soon to come iOS devices.

TL;DR: I think that this is the future of gaming, there will be mod support some time in the future. (The future of gaming for those of us who can&#39;t afford a decent rig or console.) P.S. there is a $119.99 OnLive console bundle that includes one free game token to redeem any game you want. (even wait for a future release (i&#39;m not %100 sure if the token expires or anything))

            <p>I think InstantAction’s browser based platform was alot better for gaming. It didn’t have the advantage of streaming the game like onlive, but it did run alot smoother because it didn’t depend so heavily on the person’s connection. Most of the games were stored in the appdata folders similarly to quakelive, and the was about 500mb each.</p>

            <p>I played various games on onlive for about 45 minutes in total, the quality is exactly like a 720p youtube video, no stuttering unless I use Wifi, bearable input lag, compared to consoles it’s not bad but obviously doesn’t come near the PC gaming experience.</p>

            <p>I played AssCreed fine with both KBM and a controller. Dion’t see why either setup really takes that much getting used to, both are fairly straightforward.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s, like, your opinion, man. I find that the keys are well spread and made around the position of the fingers when in laid out in the WASD scheme.</p>
<p>As for the topic at hand, I haven’t had a proper experience with Onlive since there aren’t any servers in Europe near me and as such I have immense lag and shitty picture quality when I try the service.</p>

            <p>It’s because the controls are all over the place, the setup makes almost no sense. When you use a controller everything is fluent and smooth, all the buttons make sense, it’s a lot easier just pick up and play.</p>

<p>Wait, it has the full game on stream (I know it’s Gaikai), but I didn’t know you could play the full game, I only played the demos.</p>

</aside>
<p>I sincerely have no fucking idea of why people think playing Assassin’s Creed with a mouse and keyboard is like a fucking challenge of the Olympian gods. It takes a couple of minutes to get used to and after that is smooth sailing all the way to the end.</p>
<p>Granted, I’ve actually not played it with a gamepad but I really didn’t have any difficulty at all getting used to the controls of it right back when the first game came out.</p>
<p>I really don’t get it.</p>

<p>Oh, I understand. Mine doesn’t look too good either, Windstream overcharges me for the internet, 3mb/s for $39.99 is outrageous. They are lucky that they are the only ISP in Sanford. My bro gets like 6 or 10mb/s for 39.99 (double the speed)</p>
