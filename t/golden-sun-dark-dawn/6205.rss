    <title>golden sun: dark dawn</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/golden-sun-dark-dawn/6205</link>
    <description>so i got this game, and started playing it. Very happy with how it&#39;s been going  :slight_smile: 
one thing i don&#39;t understand... why camelot introduced &quot;points of no return in the middle of the game. The originals never had those (at least not of this magnitude); they at least allowed me to backtrack to find summons and djinni i missed.

o well, GoldenSun appreciation thread?</description>
