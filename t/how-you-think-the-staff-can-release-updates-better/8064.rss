    <title>How YOU think the staff can release Updates better</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-you-think-the-staff-can-release-updates-better/8064</link>
    <description>Ok, so i know you&#39;ll see the thread name and think i&#39;m committing the cardinal sin here. Bear with me for a couple sentences. 

I&#39;m posting this because i have spent a while now looking all over the place to find accurate and up-to-date info on the release of BMS. I haven&#39;t really had any luck. The main page is obviously outdated and is still showing a trailer made almost 3 years ago. The wiki has released some new media but it still makes the development status unclear since it could be older media just being shown. Many people are sure the mod is still alive and kicking but if thats true why is there so little said about its status? On the contrary, quite a few other forums are sure the mod is dead. 

Due to the extreme popularity and demand of this mod, i think some easy and quick updates are all that, speaking for the community, we ask. I wanted to use this thread to see how the community thinks a better job can be done with giving us updates, cause a lot of us are in the dark. 

I think if the staff simply posts a couple sentences once a month on the site frontpage saying how development is going, that would be good enough. As long as we have some info. Again, don&#39;t take offense to this or call me a troll, i feel like the team should be flattered that so many people are eager to see this released, and this thread could maybe calm that down.</description>

<p>Well geeze, you didn’t have to bite his head off. I’m content with waiting, as there are plenty of other games I have yet to enjoy, but shooting down noobs is no way to go about conducting business. A courteous response goes a long way rather than shunning them immediately when they decide to start a thread. Given that this happens on more than one occasion I understand it gets annoying, but yelling at them isn’t going to help either.</p>

</aside>
<p>At least I would be really interested in ANY kind of official news from you guys, be it a release date or a screenshot or a description of some issue you have encountered and solved during development. Something which in some way helps us to wait. Something that says “we are still here, and making progress”.<br>
You could just say that “still here” and I would be glad.</p>
<p>Glad to hear from you Ram.</p>

<p>This.</p>
<p>It’s quite remarkable how, apparently, there are lots of forum regulars here who are far more annoyed and far less forgiving towards the topic’s first post, than an actual developer (who DOES has influence on the official updates, and has more right to be annoyed by the OP) who even seems to even be slightly saying “mea culpa, but it is how it is”.<br>
I’d have expected the devs to be annoyed more than the forum regulars, but it’s the other way around.</p>

<p>Laughter is the best medicine.That’s what these forums are for. I know it’s not an ideal solution, but we’ve already tried main-page news updates, devplans, ModDB, devblogs, Twitter, YouTube, etc. and none of them have really worked as well as anyone would like. In an ideal world we’d have had something simple in place from the get-go, but at this stage we’re all just victims of the circumstances we’ve created. Starting to post little meaningless progress updates (we’re still working on it, today we did stuff!) is going to be pretty cold comfort after eighteen months of silence.

            <p>Updates are fine. JK made a special thread which everyone, even noobs can easily find. If they don’t want to search 2min for their answer and annoy everybody, I find normal for some of our ruthless members to take them down.</p>
<p>And the last update about the mod is still valid : <span class="bbcode-i">in development</span> or as we say <span class="bbcode-i">When it’s done</span>.</p>

            <p>Come on guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s a bit annoying people constantly asking for updates, but turning around and saying “OMG so many ppl ask 4 updates go awai” is kind of the wrong attitude.</p>
<p>I think one of the mods has made a sticky for all the new content, which is great. But when new people come on here, it’s a bit obvious that new content isn’t the easiest to find unless you go delving. Yes, its easy for all of us because we know where it is but chastising new people isn’t the way to go about getting new followers for this mod.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a different situation but I see it all too often, old members talking down to new ones for not “knowing”.</p>

            <p>The updates are handled very well for the mod, especially for one this far into development.</p>
<p>Frequent updates are for the first months of development (still not regular). Monthly/regular updates are not part of the development model for a mod nor a requirement. If they wanted to adopt it, they would have.</p>
<p>There are tons of media already released, one very nice teaser and a professionally done trailer. The devs said they want to focus on finishing the mod, so next big update will probably be the mod’s release. (Still not saying that “next” means “coming soon”).</p>
<p>There will always be people that will claim a mod is dead (for any mod), when they are frustrated because it wasn’t released within their own timeframe. Even if the devs explicitly reply that they are still working on it. They won’t bother to even look for information in the mod’s wiki, or forum, especially threads like the sticky threads in this subsection. Also, there are far too many people who for some reason are so personally pissed with the mod (I believe that they are largely the same crowd that Fiberawptic thinks that would “calm down” with upodates), that wait “around the corner” just to diss any kind of update attempt.</p>
<p>Finally, troubling yourself with what other “people” expect or would like to see will not get you anywhere. There is no possible way to calm all people down.</p>

<p>Being my last post, I’d like to say i was originally thanking you for giving me that link. I think its sad that lot of people won’t see it and will be left in the dark. And it’s easy to imply thinking someone is “trolling” but frankly it’s insignificant. Thanks Black Mesa Team for your dedication, it will all be worth it when it’s done.</p>

<p>It was pretty thoughtful criticism. You clearly didn’t read much of the original post. I’m sorry that i consider myself of fan of this upcoming mod and i just wanted to find out about its development status because i looked in 50 different places and couldn’t find anything. Maybe theres a reason why people join up here and ask the same question i did… But oh no, go ahead and just label everyone who does a “troll” if it makes you feel better.</p>

            <p>I didn’t see the link you initially posted. I read it and yes, im glad to receive that information. I feel like that thread should be linked in the FAQ, at the least. Maybe on the front page, just so new visitors understand why there aren’t a lot of updates, like I just did. Looks like my posts are being monitored now for some reason. I just think the Dev Team needs to remember that the fan base they have is like an upset mother who wants the best for their kid even if they are unfair sometimes. We just want to see this released and we are drenched in anticipation. It can be a little frustrating at times when you don’t know if its still in business or not.</p>

            <p>Lol speaking for the community. The majority of us are happy waiting for the mod to be released and don’t require daily sustenance in the form of updates. And anyway there has been a lot of media given away. So you’re not speaking for anybody other than yourself.</p>
