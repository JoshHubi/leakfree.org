    <title>Pickup-able giant Crate [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pickup-able-giant-crate-fixed/9625</link>
    <description>On the same level (both map file and physical hieght &quot;level&quot;) as the first bullsquid there is a double stacked black crate (with tension straps to join them as one large unit) which I can pick up. It&#39;s huge and awkward and Gordon would never be able to pick it up.

After you dive in to the water, swim under a wall, climb up a ladder, it&#39;s in the next room against the right wall. Near the med station and dead scientist.</description>
