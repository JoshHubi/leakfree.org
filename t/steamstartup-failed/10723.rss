    <title>&quot;SteamStartup failed.&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steamstartup-failed/10723</link>
    <description>So I recently downloaded Black Mesa and have asolutely loved it. I&#39;ve gotten to the last chapter of the game with almost no issues, expect the occasional crash or two. 

However, after crashing yet again in the part where you acquire the long jump boots, the game won&#39;t start anymore. I only get this error:

Is there any way to fix this? Is this a common error, and if so, what&#39;s causing it?

Any help would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>Oh, nevermind, nevermind. I was being an idiot.</p>
<p>Apparently this happens with quite a lot of games, and can usually be fixed by simply restarting Steam. I tried it, and it worked.</p>
<p>Sorry for taking your time!</p>
