            <p>I’ll give the specs I know about</p>
<p>This is a laptop, Dell Inspiron e1505, with:<br>
-ATI Mobility Radeon x1400<br>
-Intel Dual Core T2080 1.73 GHz<br>
-2 GB RAM<br>
-Windows 7 Pro 32 Bit</p>
<p>It’s not that great, but does what I need it to. I can handle all source games that I have tried so far (which excludes L4D2) with no problems.</p>
<p>I do like playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. SoC, but I there are certain maps that are near impossible to play on even after tweaking.</p>
<p>Luckily, I’ll be getting some help in building a new PC soon.</p>

            <p>CrossfireX is the same as nvidia’s SLI, buts its more flexible (ie. u can crossfire a 5870 and a 5850 or 5770, but u cant SLI two different nvidia cards) and each card remains independant which means u can still run monitors from all of the cards even while there linked.</p>

            <p>it is the ATI version of sli. It depends on how many lanes of PCIe your chipset has total - P55 only has 16, so with one card the card gets 16 full lanes, but with 2 you get 2 8 lanes. X58 on the other hand has 32 I believe. Switching to 8 lanes only lowers your performance by about 4%. going to 4 lanes has a pretty big effect though, so I wouldn’t recommend triple crossfire.</p>

            <p>I was under the impression that Crossfire was ATi’s version of SLi, which is using two different cards in two different x16 slots. Or more cards/slots as necessary.</p>

<p>I want to run Episode 2 at more than 30 FPS… I’m going to runn CrossfireX (3) for my 5770 … maybe. I can’t decide on 2 or three. My PSU is 750W + 3.7 GHz CPU… will that be too much for it? I saw the max for crossfirex3 as far as wattage goes was like 324w. Advice please</p>

<p>But also, I never installed/updated anything to DX11.  The last DX update I did was with the last game I installed, and it just did whatever it had to do to run.  Forget what game it was though…</p>

            <p>Ur software level is DX11, but your hardware level is DX10. You can only run games up to what ur hardware level is, even if your software level is higher.</p>

            <p>Lets see, all of my harware is fine except for my graphics card which is starting to show its age. The newest game I have is L4D2 and it works ok on the lowest settings but the water effects do not appear. Instead of water I just have a white slab with zombies wading through it, which in some ways makes Hard Rain and Swam Fever alot easier.</p>
