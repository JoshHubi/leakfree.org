    <title>Game pad support problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-pad-support-problem/3203</link>
    <description>So I have a power-wave pc controller - skull edition with the correct drivers installed, which my computer seems to read fine, but when using it with a game, my most recent example being Metal Gear Solid 1, it doesn&#39;t work at all. The controller config within the game lets me change the controls with the game pad but anything other than that doesn&#39;t work.

I tried using a config program &#39;Joytokey&#39; which lets you assign controls and whatnot, but that also doesn&#39;t even acknowledge the existence of the controller..

Anyone got a solution. Or is it a good idea to just get a less retarded game pad?

Oh i&#39;m running windows xp. If thats relevant.</description>
