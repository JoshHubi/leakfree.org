<p>You’re mixing up “sense of realism” with “lifelike”.</p>
<p>48fps adds so much detail and crisp to the picture that it looks and feels as if you’re really there looking at the real people in the real environment. It makes movies look lifelike.</p>
<p>But you know what ticks me off about the 48fps in, for example, The Hobbit (other than making props look like props rather than real items)? Jackson (horrible director, by the way) still added (or didn’t remove) lens flares to some of the lighting. It’s one thing to use 48fps to make it as if you’re right in the middle of the action, but then don’t go and mimic effects unique to lenses.</p>
<p>Abrams wants to achieve a sense of realism by making it look like you’re watching a documentary or watching the events captured by a camera. 48fps would completely nullify that effect. Accentuating lens anomalies enhances it (or in the case of Abrams: often exaggerate).</p>
<p>I for one hope 48fps won’t become the new standard for movies. It should be an artistic choice to use it (much like lens- and/or film choice). And if a director chooses 48fps, he should stick with that choice and not have lens flares left and right whilst doing it on 48fps.</p>
<p>Final rant about Jackson: if it wasn’t for the popularity of Tolkien’s work, his movies (and career) would be a giant flop. He’s one of the worst blockbuster directors I’ve ever seen. His eye for composition is terrible, his use of cheesy shots (like Kung-Fu-movie-styled close-ups and frog-perspective shots) often kill the mood of any scene and it seems like he requires his actors to act badly.</p>

<p>But lots of cheap (handheld cameras) film at 60 fps. And that’s why soap operas are higher framerate usually, because they have cheaper budgets. I kind of agree that it should be a choice to use (like sound and color were choices and still are in the film industry) but I do hope that it becomes much more common like the two I listed above. 24 fps was only adopted at the beginning because cost of film was still a thing, and while I suppose that space is still a thing (and there might be more math but a 48 fps (or higher) movie would take up twice as much space at least as a 24 fps movie) it’s still not as much as film cost. I never did watch the Hobbit so I’ll have to do that, just to see how a natively filmed 48 fps movie looks.</p>
<p>I like Peter Jackson because he gave some money to Blomkamp to make District 9  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  .</p>

            <p>About the dust/glare stuff.</p>
<p>Simon Pegg recently defended the often-criticized use of lens flares in J.J. Abrams’ movies by saying that Abrams uses them to induce a sense of realism by accentuating specific anomalies that happen when light hits a lens.</p>
<p>It makes everything look like a filmed event, a documentary of sorts. It makes the audience feel as if they’re actually witnessing real life events. Much like how Spielberg sprayed bloody seawater on the lens in Saving Private Ryan.</p>
<p>I think these effects really add to the atmosphere of games like The Last of Us, because as a player you’re viewing everything from a relatively short distance. In BF3 it might not make a lot of sense since you’re not a witness looking from a distance but rather the soldier himself… But I guess they’re wearing goggles or glasses or whatever.</p>

            <p>Next-gen = current gen with mad post-processing.</p>
<p>The lens flare thing does look cool as shit but only in situations where applicable. For example, a military game using that simulates wearing ballistic goggles, which makes sense. Idk if you guys have worn goggles for anything (be it lab work, swimming, or even paintball) but it is so easy to smudge or disrupt the clarity of the plastic. It makes senses that the grime on the lenses would pick up the light as you look around. Just so long as it’s not overdone.</p>
<p>The Last of Us, that just doesn’t fit. It’s a third person game. Unless your actual character is a camera viewing Joel, it makes no sense.</p>

            <p>I have. Film grain filter, blur from mlaa, and low fov from looking through a window from your robot. I really hate film grain most of all and don’t know why mlaa is used instead of smaa. The looking outside a robot doesn’t really bother me but what does is vignetting where they darken the edges of the screen. It was annoying as hell in Dishonored because it happened every time you crouched. Thiaf looks worse in that respect too. Especially since it moves around and flashes and stuff.</p>

            <p>They weren’t a good representation of what the Cryengine 3 is capable of. Check out the official trailers from Crytek and you’ll see it properly.</p>
<p>Epic’s Samaritan trailer and the UE4 trailer are also better examples of DX11 features.</p>
<p>edit: oh, whoops, for some reason I thought that was made with Cryengine 3. Nevertheless, my point still stands.</p>

<p>Then I’d really like to know what would you consider to be special. And thank you for letting us know about your distaste of particular genre of music.</p>
<p>All side, those graphics seriously didn’t impress you? ._.</p>

</aside>
<p>It makes more sense in a third person game than in a first person game unless you’re wearing a mask in the first person game. It’s bad in any game though. BF3 started the “dust on your eyes” crap I think.</p>

            <p>Well, we are only talking about a graphics engine here, not any game in particular.</p>
<p>Gameplay is first and foremost, yeah, but visuals are also important.</p>

<p>Chess with golden and platinum pieces on an ivory board might look fancy, but it’s still a boring game.</p>
