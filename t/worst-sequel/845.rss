<p>Quake was okay, but its sequel Half Life was godawful. And then Half Life 2 came out just to piss on the graves of the people who had died as a result of how awful Half Life was. And then Deus Ex took a big sloppy blood stained shit all over everybody. Thank god DE: Invisible War came out, or the gaming industry might never have recovered.</p>

<p>FCOM allows the four biggest overhaul mods to work together, Oscuro’s overhaul Martigens monster mod and Francescos are the three I would reccoment as your top priorities. War Cry is good and I would also recomend if but get it last if you don’t think your internets can handle it. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>oh and one last thing, FCOM IS A BITCH TO INSTALL. If your not comfortable with putting lots of things in their exact place then just get Oscuro’s and Martigens, I think those two are compatible.</p>
<p>But if you feel up to making your game superpacked with weapons, enemies, armor and more I would definatly suggest you try FCOM: <a href="https://devnull.sweetdanger.net/convergence.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://devnull.sweetdanger.net/convergence.html</a></p>

            <p>You’re perfectly welcome to like a game I don’t. I wish I found it as awesome as you did, I really do. Because I loved Morrowind. There were improvements in the combat, but it still felt boring and broken. I actually disagree with you that not having a larger array of armor and weapons is not a big deal. In my eyes it is, but at least we can agree to disagree.</p>

<p>If you’re talking about Shivering Isles -which was sold as DLC on the website btw- talk about crappy sequels. Three new enemies? Wow. I like how you totally ignored the other points of my post though. Still I guess it doesn’t matter since you’ve apparently ignored me. A whole lot it takes to get that done around these forums, like, having an opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Fine, I’ll take you seriously. I honestly did not think you could say that Shivering Isles sucked, since it was in fact awesome. Sheogorath was an amazing character, the isles looked great and the art design was fantastic, the side quests funny, and the scope massive. I enjoyed it more than the Oblivion, which I loved.<br>
As far as combat goes, its a step up from Morrowind, when you could swing your massive sword at a guy, and do no damage. Plus magic was massively improved, making a combo character much easier, and the simplification of armor was hardly a major issue as armor in general is a basic upgrade idea and you just switch it out with the better stuff, no strategy involved.<br>
The story wasn’t as good, but I barely even played the main quest. Its really not the point. The point is the massive world with all the subquests, monsters and the like to find and kill, and it was awesome.</p>

            <p>Spider-man 3</p>
<p>Spider-man 2 was a great movie and an even better game, you could go fucking <span class="bbcode-i">anywhere</span> because you were fucking <span class="bbcode-i">Spider-man</span>. One of the first games to really make you feel like a superhero.<br>
Spider-man 3 fucked both movie-wise and game-wise. Gone were the awesome moves. Gone were the memorable boss fights and gone were the random acts of do-goodery. Instead we get fucking <span class="bbcode-i">Morbius </span>.<br>
ugh, that game pissed me off so very much.</p>

        <title>Worst Sequel</title>

            <p>Thanks for your intelligent response, Ajax. I’m inclined to agree. There were some things that Oblivion did well, but I was expecting it to be better than it’s predecessor, not on par with it or worse 6+ years later. I suppose my expectations were set too high, but they COULD have been met. That’s what really boils my blood. As a result, I have over 200 hours logged on my (favorite) Morrowind character. Oblivion? Something like 40 hours cumulative across all saves.</p>

            <p>I agree, really. There were things that Oblivion did well, and there were things that Oblivion did terrible. Animations were terrible. Fighting was rather boring, as, really, you just keep mashing the attack button when they’re not attacking, and holding the block button when they are. Lockpicking is terrible. Persuasion is terrible. Fast travel the way they did it was absolutely horrible (I like actually travelling everywhere I need to go). The new barter system was confusing at first, though it was a slight improvement.</p>
<p>As for the story…you can beat the entire story in less than a day, real-time. They spent more time getting Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean (Patrick must’ve been harder, though) to do the voices for the characters than they did actually making you care about them. The only chars in the entire main quest I liked, was Baurus (sp?) and Jauffre. Everyone else sucked. I got through the main quest in one game before I was even level five. To do that in Morrowind, you had to cheat, either to get great weapons and armor, or god mode.</p>
<p>The world was awesome, but the whole “levels with you” idea, they way they did it, sucked. Travel the whole world as level one, and never see anything other than a few wolves. Same thing at level 15, and MINOTAURS EVERY CORNER! Morrowind, if I recall correctly, had all of the animals leveling with the player…which meant the animals temselves. They didn’t get replaced with tougher enemies, they got stronger themselves. Sure, higher level enemies didn’t show up at lower levels, but still.</p>
<p>Morrowind had two expansions with detailed quests, dozens of new weapons, armors, and monsters, and a brand-new worldspace each. Oblivion had eight DLC’s with simple, one-off quests that took a part of the existing worldspace and morphed it. Castle got built overnight, cave delved in one spot, etc. It got one DLC that added a pretty cool set of quests, but again, no new worldspace, just modified worldspace with a few new dungeons. And one DLC, which they call, and sold seperately as, an expansion pack, that adds a limited amount of new things and a new worldspace.</p>
<p>The feel for Morrowind was a new fantasy world that was dark, realistic, and interesting. Something not seen before. The feel of Oblivion was “Look at the pretty world! Generic ruins! Generic fantasy monsters (with a few unique ones)! Lord of the Rings armors! Isn’t it awesome!?”</p>
<p>I liked Oblivion, though. Sneaking and archery were improved. Complete voice acting was a good idea (Even though everyone sounds the same, and looks extraordinarily like everyone else [it was the nose and the hair…everone had the same nose and hair…]). The world was pretty, though I would have expected it to be populated with more than deer and things that was to kill me. The clothing was better (Though the armor system sucks…hooray for armor that comes in five pieces! I missed the Morrowind style…two boots, greaves, chest piece, each pauldron, each gauntlet, the helmet, and the shield…imagine the possibilities…). Oblivion had a better magic system, overall…but Morrowind’s item enchanting was better, IMO.</p>
<p>Oblivion did some things well, and the things it did well, I liked. Archery, sneaking, clothing, voice acting, graphics, etc. And I will admit, I like the lockpicking minigame, but I would not be sad if it was gone. But there were a lot of things Morrowind did better Persuasion, fast travel, story, characters, monster leveling, unique feel. Would I rather Oblivion took some hints from Morrowind? Yes. The things Morrowind did better, I want to see improved. Is Oblivion a bad sequel…in a way, yes. It is a good game? Yes.</p>

<p>If you’re talking about Shivering Isles -which was sold as DLC on the website btw- talk about crappy sequels. Three new enemies? Wow. I like how you totally ignored the other points of my post though. Still I guess it doesn’t matter since you’ve apparently ignored me. A whole lot it takes to get that done around these forums, like, having an opinion.</p>

            <p>I’m not saying Oblivion is the worst sequel ever made, but it was the biggest disappointment.</p>
<p>I went into that game with high expectations. I figured we’d actually have engaging combat this time around. Nope. Block, attack twice, repeat.</p>
<p>I thought we’d have better character animations. Nope. Everyone still floats around.</p>
<p>I thought we’d have a larger selection of armor and weapons. Nope, we got less.</p>
<p>The story was a step down. I went from being a recognized savior to just that one guy the Emperor hangs out with. There were no expansions, bye werewolves. The DLC was all terrible.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the game could have been great but it wasn’t. At least to me.</p>
