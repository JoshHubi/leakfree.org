    <title>PC consistently turns off when playing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pc-consistently-turns-off-when-playing/14350</link>
    <description>This has been happening consistently every time I boot up the game and load up a save now. I can play for about a minute or two before my PC shuts off completely. I have done appropriate checks on the hardware to check if anything is overheating, along with stress testing using other games. This has been happening for a while now, and I&#39;ve decided to try once again today after completely giving up on the game for about a month.

Now, I actually have a auto-save file which crashes immediately on load, and will upload the file if I can find out where it is, or if someone can tell me. The thumbnail for the save is just a black mesa logo.

This issue did not start immediately, and I had got up to the chapter &#39;Questionable Ethics&#39; and had just left the scientists in the lobby when this bug started appearing. I attempted to replay from one of my earlier saves (situated in &#39;On a rail&#39; and after a while of no problems, that started experiencing the same issue.

This issue has not occured with any other game.

I could not find any logs.</description>
