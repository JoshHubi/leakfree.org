    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mskyuunis-all-purpose-guns/13455</link>
    <description>I put together some gun sounds for Black Mesa, with the intent of bringing genuine power to the audio. The shots were designed to seem plausible in small, medium and large indoor environments, as well as the outdoor desert environments. The sounds are based primarily on CoD MW3 and Black Ops, Battlefield Play4Free, Crysis, and cleaned-up sounds from HL1. If you want the static-free HL sounds or have a criticism to offer, please just tell me. So far, these are only compatible with vanilla guns. Currently, the pack includes sound for the Glock, SPAS-12, Colt Python, MP5 and Crossbow.

Soon to be added (will remove when done):
Compatibility with Animation Revamp
Explosive weapon sounds
SPAS, 357, and MP5 reload sounds (syncing for these is slightly fucked)</description>

<p>I use REAPER. Yes, I have HL2 so I could give you those sounds, and yes I could post the HL1 sounds.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That would be awesome if u could post a link. The hl1 sounds need to be cleaned up versions though. I already have the originals but they  have to much static for me to use.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I had an idea. I remember making a nice mp5 sound with the smg from hl2. I cant download it at the moment, was wondering if by any chance you had it installed? If you could upload the smg, 357, shotgun, and pistol sounds from it, I wouldn’t mind having a fiddle and seeing if I could make some sounds for BMS. Also some cleaned up versions of the old hl1 weapon sounds would be nice to try and make a mix between the two.</p>
<p>Another thing, what program do you use to mix/create your sounds? I am using wavepad for all mine.</p>

</aside>
<p>I spose everyone has their taste. For me it ties in nicely with the glock,357 and shotgun from the other pack I did. I also have custom hl1 sounds for the zombies, houndeye, barnacle, HECU classic voice, bullet flesh impact, all the uncut areas and animation revamp. I still use the classic shotgun I hate that stock that’s ontop especially cos its not used. I think ive gotten it to how I want the game to feel. Maybe a couple more sound changes and I’m done with my custom BM.</p>

<p>As for the glock I could point you towards Insurgency 2. Easy to use sound files there for sampling.</p>

<p>Okay. The jingle on the MP5 is because I used the original sound from HL1. I tried trimming it out, but then half the character is gone. I’ll try it with a different base. I’ll also try a different Glock echo (thanks for specifying).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its really hard making gun sounds hey, the best way ive found is to have my sound editing program open make a small change then quickload black  mesa and see in game what it sounds like. Cos it always sounds diff in game, especially when u rapid fire the glock, or full auto the mp5. Then after a listen u have an idea which part of the sound isnt quite right.</p>
<p>have u tried out these new ones I made? - <a href="https://www16.zippyshare.com/v/19131726/file.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www16.zippyshare.com/v/19131726/file.html</a></p>

<p>The mp5 has a metallic jingle sound towards the end of the sound. The glock echo after the initial fire sound, reminds me of someone closing a door of somekind.</p>
