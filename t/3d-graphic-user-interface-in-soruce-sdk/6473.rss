    <title>3D Graphic User Interface in Soruce SDK?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/3d-graphic-user-interface-in-soruce-sdk/6473</link>
    <description>I was playing Dead Space for a little while and liked how they created the UI&#39;s in the game. I been wondering if its possible to achieve the same effect in the Source Engine.

Found a cool video of possible technology used but still wondering how it be achieved in the source engine.

Yes, I know the video is for the Unreal SDK
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKDuzVbi50Q&#39;]YouTube Video Link[/url]

I want to make a source sdk mod with it in it for this messing around.

How would I put it in the game?

Any help would be appreciated.</description>

<p>It is possible in source but you would have to code the 3D interface which would be a lot of work. ( I’m talking about how the elements pop out of the screen )<br>
I suppose you could cheat and a create a bunch of VGUI Screens.</p>
<p>However, you can use vgui interfaces in the world like in deadspace.<br>

<p>We created a few in Black Mesa. The following videos are super old and look nothing like what we have today. Trust me when I say the new versions are better.<br>

<p>That looks cool. The Tram Screen. And if you say they look better then that compared today in source. I be speechless.</p>

<p>Ok, cool. What’s is one good way to make it. Then I will do some experimenting.</p>
