    <title>Source&#39;s Sound Engine (Mods and otherwise)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sources-sound-engine-mods-and-otherwise/12955</link>
    <description>Hey, everyone. There was a locked thread awhile ago about a sound pack someone made, and in that thread, people started to talk about sound propagation, and possibly implementing it into Source. Chickenprotector made a [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=550892&amp;postcount=7&#39;]post[/url] that provided a link to a video where someone achieved this in HL2. The video is awesome, and I&#39;d like to try out the mod... if it exists. Does anyone know if it exists, and/or where I could find it? 

Also, if you just want to talk about the topic of source&#39;s sound engine (so that this thread isn&#39;t instantly irrelevant once my question is answered), that&#39;s fine by me.

Thanks!

(BTW: Just making clear that this thread is about discussing something that was a side-discussion in a now-locked thread. Not about re-opening discussion about the sound pack that thread&#39;s OP created.)</description>

<p>It’s an amazing concept, but I can still see definite flaws. The echo seems relatively overdone. In the citizen “food court”, the echo wouldn’t be that strong, metallic and overpowering; it’d probably be a notable, hollow, toneless echo given that it’s primarily concrete and tiles. in the geometry blocking test, the sound shouldn’t be entirely blocked by the wall; in theory, it should be audible, albeit quieter and muffled. Lastly, in the living room test, the presence of carpet <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> absorb most of the reverberation. I say again, it’s a nice concept, but it needs improvement IMHO.</p>

<p>I’m sure they amped it up for demo purposes.</p>

<p>I agree that it is a bit overdone… but I think that it’s something I’d get used to and enjoy. I’d say that its something that’s certainly worth trying, you know?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Dangit. What a shame. So much work was obviously put into it and it’s too bad that they didn’t share it… maybe the did/are planning to market it, and that’s why it never saw release…</p>
