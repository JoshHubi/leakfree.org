    <title>CRASH: Lambda Core, Coolant Tower 1</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-lambda-core-coolant-tower-1/10068</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve encountered a serious crash on the first Coolant Tower in Lambda Core.  The game works normally when entering the room, with the battle (4 houndeyes, 1 bullsquid, several barnacles) going normally.  After climbing the first ladder and fighting the 2 Vorts that teleport in, I attempted to climb up the next ladder.  Upon reaching the top, I began to head towards the next ladder, in an alcove nearby, with a bright red light next to it.  However, just as I approach this last ladder, hl2.exe crashes, with the window minimizing to reveal the typical windows 7 error report.

The crash is a bit strange because normally, when I experience crashes like this, the game freezes for several seconds and sound begins to loop.  This crash immediately causes the screen to go black and cuts sound before  revealing the error message.

This crash has been replicated multiple times on my computer.
