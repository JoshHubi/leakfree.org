    <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed 2 Compared to the Original</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/assassins-creed-2-compared-to-the-original/6145</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a bit behind on the playing of these games but I was always hesitant to buy both in fear that they wouldn&#39;t work well on my PC but they both run exceptional...

       Anyway I played and beat AC in a few days and Immediately started on AC2. Having played the games back to back I got to see how much the game changed from the original to it&#39;s sequel and how drastic the changes were. (Maybe I should say how drastic the improvements were.)  Everything from the animations, music, graphics, involved story line, and down to the small subtleties displayed by town folk and guards blew me out of the water. I haven&#39;t seen a sequel turn out to be so much better than the original and how many elements were added to really put you into a different world and give you a sense of being there in Italy. The great vistas at the top of viewpoints are phenomenal and makes every climb something to look forward to. 

    Tuscany is the most beautiful piece of art I have seen in a game.  

   What did everyone else think of Assassin&#39;s Creed compared to the sequel? And what do you guys think of AC2 overall? (Those who have played it anyway)</description>

            <p>Plus there’s many more gaming hours to be had when one needs to gather so much information, codex pages etc. Better than an ego shooter that you finish after 8 hours of gameplay =/</p>
<p>And with avatar I meant he embodies that character in the animus, I was just at a lack of words xD I know that he’s his ancestor, I followed the story closely.</p>

            <p>The second game is a lot more open. It’s almost like an RPG game. The first game had more of a direct path for you to follow. I like being able to buy your gear, running your city and so on. Finding the truth is quite fun as well.</p>

            <p>I seem to be the only person in the world who can’t get into AC2. It is much better than the first one, but the story doesn’t interest me, and climbing on buildings gets old after an hour or so.</p>

            <p>I just recently purchased AC2 and thought it was incredibly good too. Additions of certain scenes such as the chase scene with the horse drawn carriage made the game a lot more fun, and the ability to purchase ones weapons and ammunition made it more interesting… being able to swim, renovate your own small city etc etc.</p>
<p>Blending the Animus gameplay with the ‘real world’ of the main character was very smart of the developers, especially so since he gained the abilities of his avatar Enzio.<br>
I really loved the addition of the dual blade system, assassinating  2 unsuspecting guards from the roof was amusing. I also found Enzio to be a more believable character, more thought out and well balanced, and the story managed to remain interesting despite being a tad repetitive.</p>
<p>The only thing I disliked is the fact that it was no longer set in the middle ages, but that’s just my personal opinion since I love that period in time.</p>
