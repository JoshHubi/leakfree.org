<p>Indeed. I only run it at 25/30 FPS at the highest settings with 4x antialiasing on a 22" (1680x1050) with the following specs:</p>

            <p>It’s a beta, not a demo. I think their reasoning behind not releasing it to the public is that they’re actively soliciting feedback on the beta version before the release - if they opened it up to everyone then they would have a lot more crap to wade through (not to mention people complaining and claiming they’ll never purchase the game because they’re basing their decisions off of an unfinished beta version) - I’m sure they’ll release a demo version once the actual game ships which should give people a chance to see whether they like it or not if they’re on the fence about buying it; at this point I see it as more of a little bonus for those who preordered, or were lucky to get a beta key. Is early access to the unfinished game (to play one map/game type, mind you) that big of a deal?</p>

            <p>DICE said that they would be making a battlefield 3 as one of their end games of the series, but it would be pc exclusive.</p>
<p>DICE needs to focus on mirror’s edge 2 and some other things IMO.</p>
<p>Also, I HATE CONSOLE BF GAMES. YOUR GUN TAKES UP HALF THE SCREEN.</p>
<p>LITERALLY. GET THE CARL G ROCKET, AND IT TAKES UP HALF THE FUCKING SCREEN.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s too late for Infinity Ward, but Bungie split from Microsoft soon after Halo 3 was released. Reach is going to be their last Halo game. They will then work on new IPs and it’s about time they did.</p>

<p>You not only pissed off every Halo hater on the forums by calling Halo 1 revolutionary, but also pissed off every PC fanboy for implying that online multiplayer on consoles is a good thing <span class="bbcode-i">(don’t get me wrong.

Halo 3’s multiplayer is near perfect. And the only downside to ODST was the price and the lack of matchmaking for Firefight. Everything else about the game was gold.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m a PC gamer by default, but theres no denying that Halo 1 changed the way the game was played, just as theres no denying Half-Life changed the game.</p>
<p>Halo didn’t revolutionize the FPS genre, just the FPS genre on the consoles.</p>
<p>BUNGIE and Infinity ward have become the most money-grubbing over rated developers in the industry. I was tricked by both companies into buying their latest products. I bought MW2 on the PC (as i no longer have a 360, and prefer FPS on the PC) only to be disappointed, and i waited online and bought Halo 3 in 2007 only to be disappointed. The fact remains that they both Sold Out big time. It was probably due to Microsoft and Activision corrupting them but they sold out none the less.</p>

<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Max Payne was the first PS2 game i owned, i have been a fan of GTA since it’s inception. i had GTA when it first came out, i saw them switch to the PS2, i was OK with that, then they switched to the 360, which ever platform they primarily develop for, they fuckover the others.</p>

<p>I’d love to try Bad Company 2 out right now, but i can’t just login to LIVE and download it, i’d have to buy it first. do you see the level of unfairness there? I’m not going to buy something just to try it. Thats the kind of arrogance that makes people torrent shit.</p>
<p>Why does the 360 get an open BETA while the PS3 and PC have to buy the game first?</p>

<p>You better be trollin’ son. What makes a game good is not technological features like this. Crysis is not the best game ever because you can cut trees in half and make sheds explode, eh? BF2 is considered by many the best because it is <span class="bbcode-i">balanced</span>. There is no overpowered weapons, the maps are extremely well designed and the vehicles are easy to drive, but hard to master.</p>

            <p>im talking about  how on a economic and moral level, they have made there company all about money where they started out all about the passion of gaming. I’m not talking about “360 sucks” or anything like that, they have just completely abandoned what used to make their companies great. I’ve watched it time and time again, i just hope Valve stays true with their devotion.</p>
<p>DICE, BUNGIE, IW, ID, Ubisoft, EPIC, Rockstar they are all selling out and have fallen down a slippery slope as developers. Due to this, I is sad.</p>
<p>I hope the up and coming developers like Tripwire stay good for a while.</p>

            <p>Well, it is a PC franchise at heart, and it looks like DICE is trying school Infinity Ward in how to get PC gamers to like them by announcing dedicated server support right after IW announced they will not, and if the beta runs well, I see no reason why they would fuck up the final product.</p>
