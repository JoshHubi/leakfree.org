    <title>HDRI photos</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hdri-photos/8516</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been going around the webs trying to find cheap spherical HDR photos to use for my architectural renders, but damn they&#39;re expensive.  Any ideas on how these photos are made?  Types of cameras, stitching and converting software?

I have no idea if any of you even use HDR files, just putting it out there.</description>

            <p>uhm, there are tons of free HDRI images in the web, why haven’t you found one yet?</p>
<p>Anyways, I’ve seen several tutorials where they explain how to use a chrome ball to take those shots.<br>
you need a good camera, which stores the photos as a raw file.</p>
