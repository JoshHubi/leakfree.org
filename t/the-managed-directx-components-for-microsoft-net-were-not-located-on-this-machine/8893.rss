Warhammer 40k fire warrior
yes, I know, you&#39;re all gonna flame me for playing a crap game etc. I don&#39;t care. despite the fact that the AI was abominable... :|

anyhoo, it goes on to tell me that it was included on the installation and that I should go back and reinstall the game. No change- I thought it might be that I needed to install DX9, which didn&#39;t work seeing as I already have DX10.

running on windows Vista btw

any sugestions?</description>

            <p>Go to the directory that holds the .exe for the game (“games directory”) and right-click-drag the .exe to the desktop and choose “Create Shortcuts Here”.  Then launch from the shortcut on the desktop.</p>
<p>Hope that helps…?</p>

            <p>Try installing the full DirectX redistributable (updates all DirectX files and should include a number of older DirectX dlls which weren’t included in Windows Vista / 7 and the DirectX Web Setup) from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br>
Installing the DirectX SDK from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> should also update the files, however the download is over 500MB…</p>
<p>You could also try updating the Microsoft .NET Framework from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
