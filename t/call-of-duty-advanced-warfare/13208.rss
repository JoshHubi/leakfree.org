    <title>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/13208</link>
    <description>Apparently Destructoid has gotten ahold of a leaked trailer. Admittedly, I haven&#39;t been interested in a Call of Duty game since Modern Warfare 2. That being said, this one actually looks different for once.

Warning: Kevin Spacey may topple your governments.
[quote]
The official reveal of the next Call of Duty is imminent. We&#39;ve seen a screenshot out of Game Informer and have a countdown set to go off Sunday morning. But let&#39;s not wait for that.

Word has it via an untitled, &quot;leaked&quot; audio recording that actor Kevin Spacey will play a role in the Sledgehammer-developed title. Variety connected the dots using a visualizer on the audio file to come up with an image that looks like a man holding a weapon. His involvement has since been confirmed. And going off that VICE-produced video about private military companies released earlier today, we know the game&#39;s general theme.

Through a trusted source, Destructoid has learned the new Call of Duty, subtitled Advanced Warfare, revolves around a soldier of fortune group run by Spacey&#39;s character that has turned on the United States government. As shown in the leaked media attached to this post, players will wear exosuits to jump super high, scale buildings, and cloak themselves. Also, hoverbikes.

<p>Well for the first time in a while I’m optimistic about a CoD game. The jet pack features looks like they’ve really improved the game’s verticality. It looks a lot like Titanfall’s infantry mechanics (which were very enjoyable) however more fleshed out with more variety and, obviously, an infantry focus. This one could be fun, however I’m still not going to hold my breath for good mod support and reasonable DLC ): or the return of wager matches from BO1.</p>
<p>I’ll have to try it out if there’s an open beta.</p>

<p>i could run cod1,2,4,W@W,mw2,bo1,bo2 without any performance issues</p>
<p>yet mw3 and ghosts (both coincidentally from the puppet-Infinity Ward) lag and look worse than anything</p>
<p>if you think of it, the Old IW only really fucked up on mw2 (by starting that whole CoD stigma thing and fucking over our serverbrowser and mods) and even still it was a decent game (then enter alterIWnet and later all of its clones/revivals, which gave mw2 the proper pc experience); mw3 and ghosts arent made by the same talent at all (even robert bowling has left)<br>
and seeing how Titanfall runs very well and is very responsive on pc, im pretty sure they would’ve done the same had the REAL IW developed mw3</p>

            <p>If this is not caused by the SubD tech, it might be caused by fragmented files on a compact disc, where the laser has to wait until the motor is aligned with the opposite ends of the disc while reading a certain point of view on the map. Basically a poorly optimized game.<br>

            <p>I think the real problem here is their inverse kinematics. It’s clearly having an effect on their lighting. And that horrible anisotropic filtering makes all the models super low-poly!</p>

            <p>No, man, obviously their modeling tools are to blame here. Modeling tools are what handles LoD and maybe if they knew how to use Photoshop they wouldn’t be having specularity issues.</p>

            <p>Those are separate things from SubD and you straight-up said SubD was directly involved with bad LoD and pop-up.</p>
<p>Even when you bash a bad game, you still need to be fair to it when it has stuff that works as intended.</p>

<p>Yeah, FFS, there’s bashing CoD for being terrible games design-wise but then there’s pulling bullshit out of your ass for not knowing what a certain feature of the game is. Lets try to be fair here.</p>

<p>all i see in Ghosts is textures popping into their proper resolutions 5 inches away from the player’s view at Max settings</p>
<p>and that only occurs half the time, other times you get <a href="https://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/3298063116799732569/BBA49CC168C13F3ABDB3BEF2D125C6658BFC5D83/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a></p>

            <p>Battlefield is the game that has 60FPS SP on consoles, in CoD they don’t optimize unless it drops below 30fps in a particular area.</p>

            <p>They do that to maintain a steadier framerate in MP on consoles. The last few CoD campaigns were barely 60fps in the campaign on console.</p>

<p>In all seriousness I agree, though. Where the hell did you “shitty draw distances” from?</p>
