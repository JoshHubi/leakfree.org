    <title>What happened to the old On a Rail music?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-happened-to-the-old-on-a-rail-music/10504</link>
    <description>In the leaked video, I thought the music in the scene fitted well.
Why was it replaced? I feel the new music is too short and doesn&#39;t suit the scene well. 

Is it because you guys changed it all up JUST because it was leaked like Valve did back in 2004?

Sorry if this is in the wrong section, I have no clue where to ask this.</description>
