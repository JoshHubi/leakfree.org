    <title>Half-life 1 theme restrooms? done! xD</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-1-theme-restrooms-done-xd/13733</link>
    <description>Hello game fans! here is a little topic about a little funny project started on a joke with friends. As a big fan of half life. Now when you are going to my toilets, here is what you will have.
It&#39;s based on an arduino board with passive infrared sensor to detect the human movement. The flush button is metallic and connected to a capacitive sensor chip to detects the finger. The water level use floating sensors for tank filling. A microphone with automatic gain control IC detects....hum.....some human ambiant sounds and randomly play posts like Barney with &quot;uuuuuh that&#39;s stink here!&quot; or &quot;something dies here no?&quot;. Very funny
the microphone is very sensitive! near to be able to sense a flie fart at 10 meters lol!
The sounds comes from the Half-Life 1 and opposing force games (from Pak0.Pak files). Some are modified and copied on a micro sd card.
It&#39;s an experience now !
enjoy! (feel free to share  :wink:  )
