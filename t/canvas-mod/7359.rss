CANVAS is a total-conversion modification for Half-Life 2: Episode 2. It is a single player action adventure game, using a third-person perspective. The player will have control of Milena, as well as her companion Borden, and have access to a multitude of psychic powers and abilities.

The player utilized 6 different &quot;color pigments&quot; used through three different &quot;filters&quot;: Projection, Injection, and Envelope. The color pigments interact with these filters differently and have varying effects on enemies and objects, creating a whole host of permutations and gameplay solutions the player can employ.

CANVAS takes place in a world where psychics exist openly. Set in the near future, psychics have been a part of the fabric of society for as long as anyone can remember. For all intents and purposes, they&#39;ve always been there. Governed not by countries, but by the multi-national psychic organisation the &#39;Society of Thorns&#39;, the psychics are still seen as outsiders within the traditional societal system.

Due to the prevalence of the Psychic population across the world, the rise of a sub-culture spanning continents arose, giving psychics a sense of belonging that they couldn&#39;t quite find in their home countries. The greatest proponents of this culture began meeting and sharing ideas, painting and creating music, planting the seed of what would eventually become the great psychic galleries of the present day.

The Acanthus gallery is the largest of these; an underground network of art and culture that spans a continent, and attracts millions of visitors every year, both psychic and human. It harbours the finest and most famous psychic paintings known to man, as well as serving as a cultural capital for the psychic world.

These psychic paintings are unique, as they allow the observer not only to view a masterpiece of traditional art, but also to use their own psychic abilities to enter and explore the painting. By doing this, visitors can experience the artist&#39;s intention when creating the painting, and still find their own interpretation. Some can even influence the art, and change it for the next viewer.

As we begin, we follow the adventures of Milena Desmaris, an adolescent girl from England, as she goes on a journey into the painting world, and along the way uncover secrets, and interact with people and paintings to discover more about her father, her situation and herself.

            <p>Mmm I mentioned this in the other thread about mods.<br>
I am very eager to play it. One of the biggest things that I love in games is distinct moods and settings, and the trailer portrays this well.</p>
<p>There is so much win in the modding community <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
