1)  Tentacles respond slowly to gunshots but it takes only few steps to call them to you really quickly (start of the vid)
2)   Jumping m8 be ok but that unfinished textures not (top of rocket engine)
3)  If tentacles are on top floor you can see how they are levitating in the air

            <p>I believe the invisible “unfinished texture” you’re referring to is an intended rendering optimization.</p>
<p>Generally, game developers don’t want to render any sides of a model that players aren’t normally supposed to see.  In this case, that “side” is the top of that rocket engine.</p>
<p>Edit: What Taceo said.</p>

</aside>
<p>When I said “unfinished texture” I meant top side of the rocket engine. I’m ok with that black thing up there as you said “you aren’t meant to be up there”<br>
And right, tentacle cant see it can only hear so firing 10 rounds from MP5 should attract its attention pretty damn quicker than 3 footsteps</p>
