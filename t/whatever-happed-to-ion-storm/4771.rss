    <title>Whatever happed to Ion Storm?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/whatever-happed-to-ion-storm/4771</link>
    <description>Seeing as the new Deus Ex game is coming out, and seeing that Square Enix is supervising it, I am greatly concerned that the game wont be as good as the original Deus Ex. So what happened to Ion Storm? They gave us one of the greatest games of all time, it seems as if all of these great old time game companies are going away. (Same happened with Sierra. Whatever happened to the origianal Half-Life publisher?) So what happed to them? Were they closed when Eidos almost went out of business this year? or what?</description>

            <p>Game studios that have very successful titles often destroy themselves attempting to top their first effort. See: 3D Realms. I guarantee there is some excellent literature on the topic of the fate of Ion Storm, why donâ€™t you google it?</p>
