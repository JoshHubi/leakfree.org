    <description>At C2E2, it was announced that Seth Green of Robot Chicken would help create a Star Wars comedy series that takes place after the events of [i]Return of the Jedi.[/i]

Thoughts?

My opinion:
[b]First thought;[/b] Wow, [b][i]ANOTHER[/i][/b] Star Wars series? Can&#39;t we just let this franchise die like it should have with [i]Return of the Jedi[/i]?
[b]Second thought;[/b] What happened to that show that takes place between III and IV anyway?
[b]Third thought;[/b] It takes place [i][b]AFTER[/b][/i] [i]RotJ[/i]? Well that just pisses on the impact of the film even more!
[b]Fourth thought;[/b] Okay, it&#39;s a comedy, by Seth Green... how the hell could that possibly work in the series&#39; canon?!</description>

<p>To be fair, the only reason why 4-5-6 were so well received and stuck in the audience’s memory, is that it’s an impressive movie for its time.</p>
<p>If you take away the time frame in which the movies have been made, and just look at the movies themselves, you’ll find that all 6 of them have the same quality to it (as in hardly any quality)… The same over-the-top bad acting, the same stereotypical characters, the same cheesy story, the same cheesy jokes and the same brainless entertainment.</p>
<p>The only thing that sets the old episodes apart from the new one, is that a movie like that was unique for its time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, if you compare them side by side, you will appreciate the original films much more, and hate the prequels even more.<br>

<p>Yep. It’s cause no one ever questions him anymore. When you watch behind the scenes videos you can see the sheer disbelief on people’s faces when they see the retarded things George comes up with. But they just agree with him and so he just does whatever the hell he wants even though its terrible.</p>
