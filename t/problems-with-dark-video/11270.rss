    <title>Problems with dark video</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problems-with-dark-video/11270</link>
    <description>Hi everyone! For the timebeing everything is working great and I am fully enjoying the experience. But I have come to notice that the game, after few seconds, gets really dark. It starts well and clear and then in a matter of few moments it goes sooooo dark I cant no see much and really affects my ability to see my surroundings. Any ideas?

Many thanks

<p>1- Black mesa is darker than HL1&amp;2, so feel free to use always the flashlight.</p>
<p>2- You can adjust the brightness in Options-&gt;Video-&gt;Adjust brightness levelâ€¦</p>
<p>3- If you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">CRT</a> monitor (unlikely), it means that is aging and you should change it.</p>
<p>4-You can modify he brightness of your monitor, You should have some buttons that allow you to do it.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.  When a save game or level loads the bightness level starts at very visable.  After a few moments the level starts to get darker and darker until the game is quite dark.  The flashlight makes little impact at this point too.</p>
