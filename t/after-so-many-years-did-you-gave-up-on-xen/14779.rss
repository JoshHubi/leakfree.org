    <title>after so many years, did you gave up on XEN?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/after-so-many-years-did-you-gave-up-on-xen/14779</link>
    <description>i know this question is tired and old, but im going to ask it anyway
i wasnt active on the forum for...years now, so many things had happened, and a lot of games, consoles, updates, graphics things have improved since
black mesa isnt as relevant as it was, and the game for all purposes is INCOMPLETE
so the question is
will black mesa XEN and overall final chapters, become another HALF-LIFE 3?
also, why do you get so angry when someone asks about it?, as far as i know, you are actually charging money for the title right? so, unlike the huge campains and episodes you actually made for free(original black mesa) you are actually getting paid for the product, so, i see no excuse whatsoever to not even say, &quot;hey people, we wont make xen ever, just enjoy the game as it is&quot;, we at LEAST deserve an answer</description>

<p>No,I’m not give since the developers have delivered a great surface tension update which meets my high expectations.Overall,I’m more interested in Earth stuff rather than the Xen one since it was just a very very bad designed world and it will take a lot of time just to make him on a par with the Earth chapters.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Judging by how much work the team puts on Xen, I think it’ll easily surpass the earthbound chapters, not even mention that it will be greatly expanded from what was seen in the original games.</p>
<p>I’m definitely looking forward to it, more so than the Earth chapters, which are unlikely to change much anyway (or actually at all, but who knows) after STU, aside from model, textures etc. improvements. I think they’re done in terms of level design.</p>

<p>Of course. People probably check back here regularly for updates (like I’m doing now). The first place I looked was News &amp; Developer Updates which is actually quite dead and has no mention of any progress on Xen.<br>
I’m not dissatisfied with with the purchase, of course. I played Black Mesa about a year ago and was blown away by the level of detail the dev. team put into the game. It was like playing a modern FPS game. For comparison, I cannot bring myself to replay HL2 as it has aged very poorly.</p>
<p>I do think the development team could provide information in the form of updates and not be tight-lipped about Xen as a show of good faith to the people who have already supported their work, though. It would certainly breathe new life into the forums if not remind people that Black Mesa still exists. If they had just given us the game as is and said they were not interested in developing Xen, many people would be 100% satisfied with the purchase (including me  ^^ ).</p>
<p>People are very touchy about subjects like HL3 and dangling carrots, after all.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Gotta disagree here though, HL2 looks far better than many games made 12yrs ago, and decent enough for the current standards too. Definitely not on par with BM, but suffices and still provides a great experience.</p>

            <p>As It is we get topics complaining about idiots complaining about xen. so yeah there is some annoyance with modern era people being unable to wait.</p>
<p>Keep in mind there was once a time, when you would have only one game per year if lucky that was worth playing. now people are all like GIVE ME THIS 2.0 I AM ENTITLED TO IT CAUSE I BOUGHT THIS 1.0.</p>

<p>Depends on what you mean by software code. If you refer to the <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">source</span> <span class="bbcode-b">code</span> </span>of the game, this couldn’t be farther from the truth. Source codes aren’t often released for the products (be them video games or another type of software). Black Mesa, for instance, doesn’t, and it will never be available from what the devs said, only a <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">maybe</span></span>, for the <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">2012 mod version.</span></span></p>
<p>Besides, I think you still don’t understand how ownership of a video game works if you think you are free to do whatever you want with it after the purchase, wtf. You can read license agreements from various games for examples, it can be that simple. And even if you do modify the game, you won’t be able to charge any costs, unless you receive explicit permission to do so from the developers, depending on what kind of modifications you brought to it. You’re wrong to assume that you can do what you want, and how you want after the purchase of the game/software. To achieve that level of freedom, there are many other processes to undergo.</p>
<p>Anyway, talking about what the devs will do after BM will be finished (which will be in the very far future), they have stated in the past that they’ll most likely not work on another new project similar to this one. We’ll pretty much have to see what happens for ourselves when the time will be right.</p>

            <p>Remember, folks.  If you put down money for the game, you did so knowing this was an early-access release of the game and did not yet include Xen.  When they are done, you will get the Xen chapters for free.</p>

<p>It’s funny how people say they own something because they paid money. Games these days come with a license to use the product under their terms of use and service agreement. You own nothing! These people with their ‘I paid money’ ideology, then start making demands, or criticize the operations of the company or team involved with the project, or with the way the game works or does not work. It happens on the Internet, such things as criticism, demands, or even judgemental viewpoints. But it’s still funny. They don’t actually own anything; they paid for a license, yet say ‘I paid money’. So what? lol</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well it’s basically just what others have already pointed out in the thread: If they bought the game, they expect the devs do what they want, when reality couldn’t be any more different.</p>
<p>But I think everybody got the idea of how things actually work and what’s the status of the game by now, we should stop going any further (not more than necessary anyway).</p>

<p>All BS about Xen aside, I’m more worried about instantly getting disliked when a post seems to be undesirable to the community.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While repeated questions about Xen have always tended to attract exasperated posts from forum veterans (and politely strained patience from the devs) they usually are not jumped on too badly if they are at least phrased with respect or genuine inquisitiveness. When posters come out of the gate with hostile, rude, aggressive or accusatory posts (the OP here managed all of the above to some extent) they rightly attract greater levels of condemnation.</p>

            <p>Now to the important question. Do you have a voice  actor for gman scene already ? Finding someone who sounds like Michael Shapiro may be a difficult task and I can’t imagine anyone who sounds different for this role.</p>
