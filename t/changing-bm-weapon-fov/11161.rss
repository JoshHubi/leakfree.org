    <title>Changing BM weapon FOV</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/changing-bm-weapon-fov/11161</link>
    <description>I want to import weapons from BM into HL2. However, the BM weapons have a different FOV than those in HL2.

The default viewmodel_fov in HL2 is 54. In order to display BM weapons properly, it needs to be changed to 90, but that makes the HL2 weapons display improperly.

There&#39;s no way to change the viewmodel_fov per-weapon, so the model itself needs to be changed.

I tried decompiling the magnum with Cannonfodder&#39;s StudioCompiler, changing the FOV angle in XSI, and then recompiling, but the model became invisible in HL2.

I&#39;m completely new at this, so I have no idea what&#39;s going on... any help would be appreciated  :slight_smile: 

Edit: apparently, viewmodel_fov isn&#39;t even used in BM. It&#39;s set to -1.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This is somewhat tedious…</p>
<p>I’ve been googleing all kinds of different keywords, to somehow find something useful, but I didn’t find anything that works, yet.</p>
<p>It seems that, either I am using the wrong variables inside the script (“fov”, etc.) or that something has to be hardcoded, so the game actually recognizes the fov variable, inside the script.</p>
<p>For some reason, changing said variable inside a script for Black Mesa does have an effect in-game, while it does not for HL2 - which strengthens the assumption that it probably has to do with a missing hardcoded segment.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In the meantime - there are 3 articles and 2 categorys I found, which could be worth looking at:</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> “v-” and “-v” are supposed to be arrows, pointing down.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A side-note:</span></p>
<p>The game does not need the “<span class="bbcode-b">weapon_manifest.txt</span>” file, this was a mistake on my part (I thought HL2 would need it, just as BM does), since the edited “printname” “ISeeSpy!” still loads in-game.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT (04:18 AM):</span> Just tried overwriting the HL2 client.dll and server.dll with the ones from BM - I expected a crash, but after closing the (working) game and looking inside the (bin) folder, where I had placed the .dll files, it seems that Half Life 2 checks the contents of said folder and replaces them with the original files (probably from inside one of the .gcf archives), on start-up.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT (04:33 AM):</span> Creating a script that only changes the command “viewmodel_fov”'s value for a specific slot, upon weapon switch is the only option / solution I can think of right now.</p>
<p>I’ll see if I can find one, then see if it works.</p>

<p>Actually, I want <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> the animations. The models for the crowbar and the magnum are the same anyway, and I want to keep the HL2 textures.</p>

            <p>Hmm, this is kind of strange… The game does use the script, but it does not seem to apply the edited “fov” value.</p>
<p>I tried to change “fov” to “v_fov” and “viewmodel_fov”, as well - it does not seem to change or apply in-game, though.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">To confirm that it does load the script file:</span></p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">…/scripts/weapon_357.txt:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">WeaponData 
{ 
	"printname"  "ISeeSpy!" 
	"viewmodel"  "models/weapons/v_357.mdl" 
	"playermodel"  "models/weapons/w_357.mdl" 
	"anim_prefix"  "python" 
	"bucket"  "1" 
	"bucket_position" "1" 
	"clip_size"  "6" 
	"default_clip"  "6" 
	"primary_ammo"  "357" 
	"secondary_ammo" "None" 
	"weight"  "7" 
	"item_flags"  "0" 
	"damage"  "75"
	"fov"	"90"
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> There’s no icon for the weapon, since its location has not been specified in the script.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice that the weapon uses both its original HL2 model and textures - as I want to change the fov first / get it to work in-game.</p>
<hr>
<p>I thought this’d be relatively easy, guess I thought wrong, again.</p>
<p>I’ll look and see if I can find any solution for this, then report back if I found anything useful…</p>

<p>Grr, it is kind of funny - just after editing the post I had found a thread in another forum, where someone asked how to edit or add script files to HL2 - I tried that and now it works (apparently).  :rolleyes:</p>
<p>It appears that the FOV is a bit weird, though.</p>
<p>I tested with a value of 150 now and it seems that, the higher the value the closer / smaller the gun gets.</p>
<p>I’ll test another one and see if it actually does change / which value I need to increase the weapons fov (instead of decreasing it), then edit the reply I prepared and add it here.</p>
<p>Until then,</p>

            <p>I was about to post a mini-tutorial, but I need to check if it really works (need to install HL2, again), before posting said tutorial (I made a backup of it) - don’t want to offend anyone by posting “BS”, again.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> I’ll edit this post to the one I’ve prepared, after I’ve confirmed for myself that it actually works.</p>
<p>Just need to wait for the installation to finish…</p>
