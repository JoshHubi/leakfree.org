    <description>I just oped a door and it didnt load the graphics behind it..
there was another way through a normal door but i took this one first and it failed. i can walk through it and the texture bug turned.

So i oped the door

so i think you should only open the door with the button.

because there was a white normal door right behind this red thing.
and this was the right way. this red thing to open the door is dispensable cause how i said you can also get out through the white door 2m behind this turnable red thing.</description>
