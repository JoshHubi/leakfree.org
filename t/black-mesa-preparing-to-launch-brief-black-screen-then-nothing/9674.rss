    <title>Black Mesa &quot;preparing to launch&quot; brief black screen, then nothing...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-preparing-to-launch-brief-black-screen-then-nothing/9674</link>
    <description>I finally managed to get the game downloaded, installed, and to show up in Steam. But now when I press play, the grey box comes up and says &quot;Preparing to launch Black Mesa...&quot;, a brief black square appears, then nothing happens. Any help would be just the greatest.

(BTW thank you development team for making this game.) :smiley:</description>

<p>Wow after maybe 3 hours trying to get this to work, messing with DLLs and changing gameids, and whatnot. Something as simple as just forcing the game to go fullscreen finally fixes it. Thanks a lot dude.</p>

            <p>After finding that I could not launch any other games from Steam, I determined my problem stemmed from deeper rooted issues. I did not mention that I am running Windows 7 on a Mac via Boot Camp, so I needed to install updates. In addition, I needed to install drivers for the graphics card and DirectX. The problem has been solved.</p>
<p>AND NOW I’M PLAYIN’ BLACK MESA WOOOO</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>I have had this same problem since last night. I also happened to use windowed mode and played for a bit before exiting. Since then I have had the exact problem described. I am having trouble locating the config files for screen mode and I want to check to see if switching back to full screen mode would fix the problem</p>

</aside>
<p>You are in I think the same situation as myself. I’ve figured out what the problem is but have not yet figured out the solution to fixing it. I have my Steam installed on my non-OS drive which has the label of [b]F:[/b]. When I try to run BMS I get a steam promt that says “preparing to launch Black Mesa”. Then I get a quick flash of what I assume is HL2.exe then it shuts down as quickly as it appeared. I then read that installing the mod into the default <span class="bbcode-b">“C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS”</span> directory works and sure enough the game did finally run(even though steam is on a completely different drive along wish Source SDK) once the installer finished and I left the “Run Black Mesa” checkbox checked on the installer.</p>
<p>However once I quit the game to try and get it to run in a borderless window the game would no longer start up again and I realized it was because Steam was still trying to run the mod in from the steam folder on [b]F:[/b] instead of the working one on [b]C:[/b]. So either I’ve got to figure out a way to make steam use the sourcemods folder on [b]C:[/b], Or make BMS realize the installation is on [b]F:[/b] properly.</p>
