</aside>
<p>Go to your BMS folder using Windows Explorer/whatever you use for that purpose. It’s in Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/BMS.</p>
<p>The 3 major things you need to backup are your maps folder, your particle folder, and the scenes folder. You can back it up by copy/pasting it to anywhere else on your Hard Drive. If you don’t have much Hard Drive space you can save some by only backing up the following maps: bm_C2A5G.bsp and bm_C3A1A.bsp, but I’d recommend backing up the whole folder just to be sure.</p>
<p>When you extract the zip, make sure you overwrite everything.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a class="mention" href="../../u/dadster-2.html">@Dadster</a>, there isn’t a great deal I can comment on your feedback as it’s mostly clipping concerns. I will address as many of them as I can but some clipping is unavoidable, especially most of what’s left in the furnace room.</p>
<p>As for the curb launching you, I’ve never observed it myself. I tried in my previous tests but it really doesn’t launch you much higher than the jump height. The road just looks a bit weird without anything separating the two lanes, at least it does to me.</p>
<p>The I-Beam being too long at the end is a difficult one to solve and I think the solution I’ve got is the best one. The beam not joining the wall would look even worse, especially if it stopped short of the pipe. It would have no structural support.</p>
<p>Shadow bleeding I might be able to fix by disabling dynamic shadows for the door, if that’s possible, which I think it is. If it’s not then there’s nothing I can do to fix it.</p>
<p>As for the dead bodies, there isn’t a great deal I can do about it. Most of the corpses on my maps are done by having ragdolls spawn suspended in the air - the positions they end up in are inconsistent and somewhat random.</p>

          <p>More feedback on v0.95b-Hotfixed</p>
<ol>
<li>LAV vehicle wheels keep turning for about 3 seconds even though it has stopped.</li>
<li>New pipe in water at mouth of pipe for satchel encounter draws you on top of it automatically, like a magnet.</li>
<li>There are several instances of HECU/Barney dead bodies in very odd and somewhat humorous positions. There is a HECU at the far end of the big battle in C2A5G. There are 2 in the same room with the AGrunt that throws the HECU thru the wall. There is a Barney on the upper floor of the security office in gasworks. Can their default death pose be amended to a more normal position? See 4 pictures.</li>
<li>The destroyed sentry turret ends up clipping into the desk (see picture).</li>
<li>I can’t affix any tripmines, anywhere. They explode immediately when I try to do so???</li>
</ol>
<p>Text, I updated this post with 1 more comment and several pictures.<br>

          <p>Found a slight problem on C2A5H. If the player stands by the detonation wall (see image) they’ll get stuck in the debris pile that pops up. I would suggest making the player die from standing too close to the explosion.</p>

          <p>My 2 cents on some comments made so far:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Balance of ST Uncut after devs patch BMS</span>: This is why TEXT’s work needs to be integrated BEFORE they balance.  The HECU receiving an accuracy nerf is almost a certainty.  This will either favor the battles more toward the aliens (fine storytelling wise but potentially annoying w/the number of survivors) or, if they’re smart and implement some of my suggestions, will make no difference.</p>
<p>What I had proposed was a slight decrease in HECU reaction time, an accuracy nerf (60-85%ish) but a slight increase in MP5 primary damage.  This creates the overall effect of a slight nerf and makes the HECU still dangerous but not behave like aimbots.  On the alien side, I suggested a slight increase in vort charge-up and possible charge-up interruption like in HL, which again creates a nerf.  In theory, these effects should cancel out on both sides.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">On TEXT becoming a BMS dev</span>: Talent-wise it’s pretty obvious that he could and would be a great intermediary between the community and the dev team.  Realistically, it’s unlikely he’ll get accepted.  Assuming the devs aren’t petty or have some bullshit excuse, there is a very good reason why he won’t be included on the team…it’s because realistically, there’s only the Xen chapters to work on.  Assuming ~80% of the dev team is still there, that would leave some 30 people working on just a few chapters, which creates a situation where a lot of toes would get stepped on.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">OAR expansion</span>: I don’t think you’ll be able to capture the HL pacing of the chapter given the extent of the BMS redesign but you could still retain some of the original’s flavor w/o having to decompile anything except for the final map (for the outdoor scene) so there is definitely some potential here.  Again, probably not worth your time if you don’t get on the dev team, but if you do decide on the remake, make sure you post the first thread on Leak-free so it’s easier for readers to see the periodic updates.</p>
<p>If you are seriously thinking about game design as a career, I’d recommend ditching OAR and play the mod Minerva by Adam Foster.  He has a very interesting philosophy on level design and I’d argue that his work is actually better than Valve’s in many ways (probably why he got hired there).  If you want a real challenge that would look great in your portfolio, consider creating a new story set in the HL universe or doing a remake of Point of View.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Promoting ST uncut</span>: For the forum posters, I recommend you make “Let’s Play BMS ST videos” on Youtube and TwitchTV.  These tend to be pretty popular and you’ll surprise many viewers when they see the new ST sections.  On the description, make sure to provide a link to TEXT’s download or to the BMS forum.<br>

[u]0.95b+hotfix critique</span>[/u]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">General impressions</span><br>
As far as I’m concerned, this version is good enough to be the final…w/the exception of the lack of a failure message in the TOW courtyard (yes, I do think it’s that much of a gamebreaker).  The garage looks much better now.  All battles are balanced but see my suggestions to improve realism of the LAV battle (really the most important fix after the TOW courtyard).  Nice job on adding the LAV-killing Agrunts…they look good.  Think the rooftop crate swap was necessary (sorry Jessie) and I like the restoration of the furnace room.  The premature Garg scene trigger has been fixed.</p>
<p>Regarding ammo/health, NO MORE ADDITIONS from now on…only substitutions and deletions.  You’ve progressively added more w/each patch, which was necessary initially for balance, but now it’s just there to keep things interesting for testers (rather than for optimizing gameplay, which is more important).  I will say that the 2 batteries prior to the gasworks were probably the best placement so far…their impact is greatly felt.  Do what you can w/these suggestions to add that extra bit of polish for the final release.</p>
<p>Green=ammo/health, Red=bad</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">General</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Lime’]When spawning in C2A5G for the final release, give players TRIPMINE and SATCHEL as they were encountered in the armory (3/5 and up is fine).</p>
<p>If you have time, do a playthrough of ST w/your final release to make sure that the player’s weapon layout isn’t affected when loading in C2A5G.</p>
<p>Delete the solid white lines that are perpendicular to the direction of the road in the TOW courtyard, LAV courtyard (where the bunker roads intersect the main road), and the tank battle (tank spawn road to main road).  This is inconsistent w/BMS as well as real US roads and is aesthetically displeasing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">C2A5G</span><br>
Garage</span><br>
Fix the arms of the impaled marine such that it’s more affected by gravity.  Otherwise he’s fine.</p>
<p>Realign the parking lines on the side of the garage closest to the outside battle to fix the disjoint between the opposite sides.  It’s most obvious in the handicapped spaces but you can see it on all floors (image 1).</p>
<p>The new food vending machines look illogically placed/awkward because they are away from the soda machines. Again, the best solution is to SWAP a food vending machine on floor G w/a drink machine and vice versa on floor 1.</p>
<p>Smooth out the transitions of the spiral driveway to remove the ramp/abrupt appearance.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘lime’]You added a battery in the outside battle WITHOUT deleting another health pickup which compounds the overgenerosity problem which was already in this section.  Move this battery by the 1st floor zombie and delete the medkit.  The destructible crate can give nothing or maybe a pair of tripmines (TOW courtyard prep).  Don’t use other explosives or uranium because of later script breaking.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘lime’]Drink machines should dispense soda.  This is consistent w/BMS but is also a good compromise to the overgenerosity problem.  People playing at harder skill.cfgs or who are really hurt can simply drink away till they’re back at 100 which will allow you to delete that zombie medkit.</p>
<p>The stripes underneath the floor 1 vending machines should no longer be there as you’ve elevated this section.  Replace w/a light gray color to reflect the new sidewalk appearance.</p>
<p>This section of the road on floor 1 still needs a correction (image 2, old image but problem’s still there).  Delete the solid white line between the roads and connect the dotted lines.</p>
<p>Although you’ve somewhat addressed the road disjoint on floor 2, it still doesn’t address the fact that there should be a road over the large hole near the driveway, which is present on the floor below.  Again the best solution is to add more DEBRIS to mask this area and the road disjoint.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Outside garage</span><br>
Now too many crates outside, which makes this section too cluttered/ claustrophobic.  Delete the crates by the marines and retest the AI battle.  Make sure it still favors the aliens more often than not.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Vent drop/car shop</span><br>
Either the destroyed window should be more bluish or its debris should be more yellowish to create a better color match.  Delete or change the explosion effect in the window as it looks like water is gushing into the room.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘lime’]Reduce health dispenser to 50 (75 is way too much, also medkits in the courtyard).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">TOW courtyard</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]Add the “failure to preserve mission-critical assets” message if the player uses up the TOW w/o opening the Agrunt silo door.</p>
<p>Make the large vehicle adjacent to the M35 destructible w/the TOW.  Note that TOW missiles currently have a tendency to clip through the vehicle.</p>
<p>The new redesign of the power generator area is bad…revert to 0.83b settings.  The power generator makes sense because of all of the power lines in the distance, but you’ve introduced too many themes now…it’s like you’ve added a gasworks to the area as well some water towers (the giant pipes are what really stick out) and both of these choices are bizarre and quite frankly dangerous to have near a power facility.</p>
<p>This new redesign also creates a contradiction in your intentions w/the harrier, though I understand it’s to hide some of the flaws w/the takeoff.  But what do you really want to do here…hide it or show it?  It seems like the former and if that’s the case, why not delete it altogether?  If you want to keep the harrier, revert to 0.83b settings to provide a clear view of the takeoff and give the harrier some sounds (the effect from the harrier flyby in early ST should work).  Also, note that the harrier does NOT need to fly in an arc as the player can’t really see it.  Thus, you don’t have to make it fly so high after takeoff, which will smooth out the angles of ascent.  Simply give the harrier a linear flight path, which is more realistic anyway.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Osprey/LAV courtyard</span><br>
Aesthetic touch-ups to the LAV battle: 1) 1 of the 2 marines guarding the Osprey now runs down the ramp and INTO the aliens to fight.  This looks odd because it’s unrealistic for the marine to give up an advantageous position (elevation) and suicide into the aliens.  Have him STAY STILL while defending. 2) Similarly, the behavior of the 4 bunker marines was better in 0.83b.  They should NOT be running into the alien mobs as it’s unrealistic.  It would look better if they didn’t cross the main road. 3) Though you changed the bunker medic’s positioning, it’s still off…place him BEHIND the first row of soldiers.</p>
<p>These are actually extensions of the bunker roads and need to be fixed (image 3)…simply delete the dotted lines.</p>
<p>The positioning of the camera does not correlate w/the image on the Barney monitor in C2A5H.  The monitor shows the helipad when it is viewed facing the TOW COURTYARD.  It SHOULD show the helipad when facing C2A5H to realistically account for the camera’s positioning/angle.  Simply take the correct screenshot and re-add it to the monitor.</p>
<p>The sentry looks a little awkward on the white table…plus it’s obstructing the map.  It might look better if you set it on the floor near the RPG ammo or near the other green crates.</p>
<p>Move the second bunker (the one w/o the LAV and soldier) the same distance out as the first bunker.  It’s unusual to have them at different distances.</p>
<p>While standing on the helipad and jumping (or just standing on the now fixed Osprey debris), you can easily see the lightly colored bland metal plate sitting atop the bunkers and the adjacent regions.  This plate should be deleted or at the very least recolored.  You can also see these plates atop many of the buildings in C2A5G-H.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">C2A5H</span><br>
Opening section</span><br>
The stairs in the dead Barney room should now lead to a DOOR, as players can now see w/in the room.</p>
<p>Regarding the blood on the wall that’s there before the marine dies, I say keep it…it probably looks worse if that huge stain appeared instantly after the marine hits the wall.</p>
<p>The placement of the wooden crates is really awkward.  Either delete (better for performance) or add more crates to reinforce the idea.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Tank battle</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Lime’]Delete the crossbow bolts in the new room by the hut and replace w/1 crate of uranium (or a pair of satchels).  You already gave 2 clips in C2A5G (LAV courtyard).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Rooftop</span><br>
You can actually add a third crate closer to the player when he gets to the rooftop (between the AC unit and the pipe leading out of it)…this doesn’t need to be a demonstration crate but would help to make this area a little more challenging and reinforce the explosives idea, as you can only see 1 crate once you’re out of the rooftop.</p>
<p>Fix the ugly hangar rooftop in the background.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘lime’]Replace the new medkit on the rooftop w/a battery (universally vs circumstantially useful…plus it still makes the furnace charger helpful).</p>
<p>Always forget to mention this, but you outrange the vort’s attack on the opposite rooftop.  If he survives, he will just stand there and look stupid.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Satpipe and furnace</span><br>
You created an inconsistency by deleting the red light on the satchel as the satchels in the car shop trap have red lights.  As red is an important warning color, you should re-add it to the pipe satchel to avoid having to delete them in the car shop.  Or do Chickenprot’s fix, which is good.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Gasworks to end</span><br>
Seems like you added an invisible wall to prevent the Agrunt from crossing the flames.  However, his movement is severely restricted and awkward now.  You can fix this by moving the flame and wall separating him and the vort more to the player’s left.  The vort doesn’t move much anyway so this doesn’t affect him.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘lime’]Add 50 health to the empty health charger (accounts for 2 medkits).  Delete the medkit in the Barney room (seems a little convenient w/an empty charger).  Delete the second medkit in the crate by the entrance to C2A5I.  This one serves no useful purpose because it’s after the .50 cal battle and there’s already a medkit by the charging vort and plenty more in the garg intro.  It becomes more useful when integrated into the charger.</p>
<p>The view of the LAV courtyard as shown on the monitor is incorrect (see above).  All other monitors are fine.</p>
<p>Delete the down arrow on the “security room” logo above the door and re-center the logo.  Direction arrows are only used on signs if the destination is far away.</p>
<p>When viewed from the outside, the hangar door exiting the gasworks is still far too close to the left to be realistic.  Adjust if possible.</p>
<p>You can improve the 3 Osprey evac even more by moving it further away from the player as he exits the gasworks (like where the old Apache used to be).  The most optimal view is achieved by having them fly right to left but you can angle it a little.  If you decide to adjust, make sure they player cannot quickly run outside the gasworks and see them insta-spawn.</p>
<p>Once the road door opens, delete the first white door to your right.  Note that this door is supposed to lead to the new area behind the hut but when viewed from w/in the hut, there’s just a wall in its place.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">C2A5I</span><br>
Garg chase</span><br>
The .50 cal by the garg still appears to be suspended in midair (you fixed the wrong one)…arrange it like you did w/the .50 cal at the tank battle (add a green crate).</p>
<p>Add something in the garg’s entrance site to justify its appearance, like a large hole in the wall that’s inaccessible to the player because of debris.</p>
<p>The garg’s pathing is broken once he gets to the long section of the reservoir (image 4).  He just makes little circles and fails to patrol the perimeter.  He does the same thing when you are in the pool.  I think you could fix the latter by giving the garg a wider patrol path…he can move toward the pool, away from it, and towards it, etc. so he doesn’t get stuck and make little circles.</p>
<p>At the entrance to FaF, rotate the handicap sign 90 degrees such that the wheel faces the parking space’s exit (it’s currently inconsistent w/your garage signs and unrealistic).</p>
<p>The dotted lines on the road leading into the FaF tunnel turn into a pair of solid lines which is unusual.  Give the tunnel road dotted lines instead.</p>
<p>Major garg clip through the white door (image 5).</p>
<p>Decrease the door opening rate such that it’s about half as fast as it is now, as it’s a little unusual.</p>
<p>Add a cracking ceiling effect in the FaF tunnel.</p>
<p>Adjust the physics of the falling ceiling debris such that it doesn’t behave like old tennis balls.  This is really just an issue when you get to the end of the corridor…a lot of pieces will fall, which creates a bizarre effect.</p>
<p>Fix the disjointed appearance of the central white line by extending the whites stripes to the garage.<br>

          <p>Dont really know if its worth mentioning or if it was intentionally done but when you head into the tunnel to FaF, the gargs animation for forcing open the door seems to get cut half way through the animation. Not saying he clips threw the door, he does his animation and stops half way threw to continue chasing you. Also Im talking about crank door not the one out in the middle of the courtyard.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Just did another playthrough and encountered no bugs at all, just clipping issues now and they have all been said already. Ive said it before…so again text superb job with this version. I know its already to late in development and youve already have everything set too the way you want it. I know with the garg chase, ive said enough about it and youve stated your point on him chasing you into FaF of “hounding the player”. But do you think you could add his animation at the door/ area portal of him peeking in at you, the same animation used in “power up”. I think that would be a fitting end of last seeing him should you choose to let him follow you that far.</p>

          <p>Haha it’s alright wangman. I think it actually ended up working pretty good. They are small enough that a new player might not think anything of them and try to walk by either of them to get a shot at the sniper, but also not as huge and obvious as I was expecting they might be. I really like luring that zombie out to get shot by the sniper too.</p>
<p>Just curious does everyone else have this<br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/NzQlm.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/NzQlm.jpg</a><br>
hole or is it just something that happened to me for some reason? I find it odd that nobody else has pointed it out because it really stuck out for me.</p>
<p>Also I agree that there should be flames in the left opening in the satchel pipe. Because of the color of the pipe you expect to see flames when you walk up to that opening and then there aren’t so it’s a little bit odd. You can see them above, but it would still look a lot better if the flames were rising up in that part as well.</p>
<p>I will still do a more thorough play-through and post on the new version+hotfix when I have a bit more free time. Since most of the major bugs are gone now there probably won’t be that much honestly. Some minor things simply have to be overlooked at some point so you can move on to bigger and better things.</p>

          <p>Couple of final points I forgot to put in:</p>
<p>The Barney’s opening line of dialog is really very hostile and is inconsistent w/his friendly demeanor in the rest of BMS…it’s like he doesn’t recognize Gordon until 15 sec after he sees you.  You could probably delete the first line and get away w/it or swap it for something more neutral.</p>
<p>Also during Barney’s speech, there were alien spawn sounds that triggered mid-dialogue though I don’t think it wrecked the spawns outside the gasworks.  This only happened on one playthrough but w/o any cheats.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Regarding the lip on the gasworks exit, you should also add it on the Agrunt silo door if you haven’t done so already, as players can look up.</p>

          <p>You’ve mentioned that you’ve had difficulty sorting through and keeping track of the plethora of feedback and suggestions that you’ve received from the community. That’s understandable. Although you’ve given back your views on our suggestions, I think it would be impossible for you to respond to every one that we’ve submitted to date. You’re only one person.</p>
<p>Looking at the feedback you’re receiving for v0.95b-Hotfixed, members are re-iterating previous suggestions from previous builds, which is fine. Is this what we should all be doing?</p>
<p>I expect you’re still incorporating changes suggested leading up to the v0.95b-Hotfixed release that you didn’t have time to include.</p>
<p>I guess my fear is that possible good and doable suggestions might get overlooked and miss inclusion in the final version, which I think you agree, is something that should be avoided.</p>
<p>So Text, what’s the process you want us to follow at this point?</p>

          <p>Was having a bit of a day off today, from mapping too; after a fairly stressful week.</p>
<p>It’s my last week of uni next week, and all my major work is done, so I got an easy week due, so plenty of time to map.</p>
<p>I’m going to spend the next few days mostly mapping, and as a result I’m hoping to get the final version out the door by Wednesday/Thursday. It’s a tight deadline, but I feel the need to set one and state it on here because if I don’t I will work on this forever. As someone pointed out, it’s healthy to draw a line under it at some point, and that point is pretty near I think. The problems left are mostly minor now, and there does come a point where minor problems have to be overlooked - the same is true of Black Mesa’s maps.</p>
<p>I’ve read through all the comments and feedback on here, and thanks, as usual, for your thoroughness and willingness to help me. I really appreciate it. I’ll try and address as much of it as I can.</p>

<p>You’ve made loads of posts and it’s mostly clipping issues, so I won’t comment on too much or point-by-point. I’ll try and sort it all out. The corpses being in funny contorted positions is probably addressable by placing the ragdolls in better spawn positions. I will try and address it. It’s a shame though, because some of it looks kinda hilarious.</p>
<p>The LAV wheels turning is a game bug. If you look at the LAVs on C2A5D and F, you’ll see they do it too - the difference being that the LAV is always far enough away that you don’t notice it. There’s not much I can do about it. It’s just gonna have to be one of those weird behaviors that most people won’t notice but some might. I can live with it. I’ve tried a few workarounds and nothing’s worked, my best bet was the scripted_sequence I used but that didn’t work.</p>
<p>Again, bugs with physics objects I can’t really address either. I can move the turret away from the desk a bit to make it less likely to happen, but it’s not something I can fix. As for tripmines not being affixable, it sounds to me like you’re getting the physics bug. Restart your game. This problem has never been reported and I’ve never had it, and there’s no reason for my maps to be doing that.</p>

<p>Found a slight problem on C2A5H. If the player stands by the detonation wall (see image) they’ll get stuck in the debris pile that pops up. I would suggest making the player die from standing too close to the explosion.</p>
<p>… yes, the ammunition amount is correct, I decided to put it to 10k for boredom and testing reasons.</p>

</aside>
<p>I can fix that. Thanks for reporting it, that’s an annoying issue. The simplest solution would probably actually be disabling player collision on the debris - players won’t even notice they’re clipping through it anyway.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thank you for your very detailed critique again, as per usual. It will hopefully be the last as the next version is final. I’ve applied to the BM Dev team but I honestly expect nothing to come of it, and won’t be disappointed. I’ll be proud of my work either way. If I can get it to be very popular, which is what I’m hoping for, it can be like an “unofficial must have,” like the Unofficial Patches for Oblivion or things like that, which would still be fantastic. I’m still in 2 minds about doing an OaR expansion. I’ll play that one by ear.</p>
<p>I’ll address the more serious of your criticisms.</p>
<p>The failure message on the TOW courtyard will be a SERIOUS pain in the ass to implement, as grenade_tows do not have any outputs apart from the User inputs/outputs. I’d have to use trigger_multiple (updating every half second or so), tied to math_counter, tied to filter_activator_name, tied to the 3 entities required to have that failure message. It’s a fairly complex I/O setup, and fills an already extremely full BSP. I’m still not sure it’s worth it. I’ll probably end up doing it though, but I don’t like it. It’s safeguarding against a ridiculously unlikely eventuality.</p>
<p>I understand your objection to the changing the pylon for the composting towers, but it’s really not an issue. The BM Dev team do it themselves on their version of C2A5G. Like the AC Units, the Composting Towers are really generally just used for…generic machines. They don’t necessarily represent actual coolant tanks/composting towers/AC Units, as retarded as that might sound. They’re just generic…filler I guess. The BM Team also heavily uses AC Units just to represent generic machines, take a look at Blast Pit, there are AC Units EVERYWHERE in illogical places. Same principle here. Lack of assets is always a problem, particularly with this kind of project, so I’m just making do with what I’m given. Can’t put much else there. And the Pylon is NOT an option. It is simply not an option. The areaportal I use to block visibility once you reach the helipad is just way too effective to sacrifice, but the side effect is it stops the pylon from rendering. There is no workaround for this. The areaportal literally makes a 30 - 40 frame difference at the helipad. Covering up the Harrier had nothing to do with it, really.</p>
<p>I don’t really get your objections to the LAV fight changes either. It sometimes strikes me that you like to say things in the previous version were better…just for the sake of it. It’s far superior now. The Marines from the bunker splitting up, as they did before, made very little sense and resulted in them getting smashed as individually they are weak against the swarms of aliens. Why would THEY split up, anyway? As for the Marines at the helipad charging down, I agree it’s not ideal…but it’s not terrible, either. He’s rushing down to help his friends survive. It’s a sacrifice. I didn’t plan on it happening but I quite liked it when it did. It’s a dumb decision. But it’s a little bit of humanity too. Human beings make dumb decisions, soldier or not. I might change it, I may not.</p>
<p>The stairs in the dead Barney room on C2A5H are intended to be the first part of a stairwell, a door is not needed. That’s why the stairs only go halfway up the room’s height before stopping.</p>
<p>Erm…that’s it for serious objections I guess. Although your objections to the many decisions with parking lines and whatnot on C2A5I is not something I am willing to address. Those were ALL designed by the BM devs and it’s not something I’m willing to change.</p>
<p>As for your later comment on Barney’s opening lines being hostile - he’s just responding to someone coming down HIS stairs. You can tell from the surrounding scene that there’s been a serious 3 way fight here before, of course the survivor would be on his toes! He shouts “You’d better stand down, buddy!” then suddenly registers that it’s Freeman. His lines after that, are very calm and friendly, at least it seems that way to me. That’s how I’d intended it to be. I’d imagined that it’s realistic that you probably wouldn’t recognize somebody right away, given the adrenaline that’d be pumping through you and whatnot. I thought it worked well, personally. I was a little upset that nobody commented on it until you!</p>
<p>Thank you for being detailed and thorough as ever. Sorry if my reply isn’t fully adequate, but as I’m sure you know, there’s way too much to trawl through. I still read it all and took it all in.</p>

<p>Dont really know if its worth mentioning or if it was intentionally done but when you head into the tunnel to FaF, the gargs animation for forcing open the door seems to get cut half way through the animation. Not saying he clips threw the door, he does his animation and stops half way threw to continue chasing you. Also Im talking about crank door not the one out in the middle of the courtyard.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Just did another playthrough and encountered no bugs at all, just clipping issues now and they have all been said already. Ive said it before…so again text superb job with this version. I know its already to late in development and youve already have everything set too the way you want it. I know with the garg chase, ive said enough about it and youve stated your point on him chasing you into FaF of “hounding the player”. But do you think you could add his animation at the door/ area portal of him peaking in at you, the same animation used in “power up”. I think that would be a fitting end of last seeing him should you choose to let him follow you that far.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, the animation cutoff was a workaround for another problem (him doing the animation when the doors were fully opened) which went wrong and affected it where it shouldn’t have. I added the output to the door “OnFullyOpen,” which targets the sequence with “Cancel Sequence,” and then “Kill”. The idea being if the door is already open the sequence can’t fire. I of course completely forgot, being the moron that I am, that when the Garg pries the door open he too can fully open them, thus firing the output mid sequence and making it cut himself off. I will fix it for the next version.</p>
<p>I may be able to get that peeking animation at the start of C3A1A, it’s a nice idea. I’ll see what I can do.</p>

<p>Haha it’s alright wangman. I think it actually ended up working pretty good. They are small enough that a new player might not think anything of them and try to walk by either of them to get a shot at the sniper, but also not as huge and obvious as I was expecting they might be. I really like luring that zombie out to get shot by the sniper too.</p>
<p>Just curious does everyone else have this<br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/NzQlm.jpg" data-bbcode="true">https://i.imgur.com/NzQlm.jpg</a><br>
hole or is it just something that happened to me for some reason? I find it odd that nobody else has pointed it out because it really stuck out for me.</p>
<p>Also I agree that there should be flames in the left opening in the satchel pipe. Because of the color of the pipe you expect to see flames when you walk up to that opening and then there aren’t so it’s a little bit odd. You can see them above, but it would still look a lot better if the flames were rising up in that part as well.</p>
<p>I will still do a more thorough play-through and post on the new version+hotfix when I have a bit more free time. Since most of the major bugs are gone now there probably won’t be that much honestly. Some minor things simply have to be overlooked at some point so you can move on to bigger and better things.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have never seen that before, but having launched up the game and taking a look at it myself it’s very obvious now. Thanks for pointing it out. I reckon the reason nobody noticed it is because everyone focuses on the sequence outside, it really draws attention away from anything else.</p>
<p>I’ll probably add more flames to the furnace left of the satchel pipe too, it is a little unclear.</p>

<p>You’ve mentioned that you’ve had difficulty sorting through and keeping track of the plethora of feedback and suggestions that you’ve received from the community. That’s understandable. Although you’ve given back your views on our suggestions, I think it would be impossible for you to respond to every one that we’ve submitted to date. You’re only one person.</p>
<p>Looking at the feedback you’re receiving for v0.95b-Hotfixed, members are re-iterating previous suggestions from previous builds, which is fine. Is this what we should all be doing?</p>
<p>I expect you’re still incorporating changes suggested leading up to the v0.95b-Hotfixed release that you didn’t have time to include.</p>
<p>I guess my fear is that possible good and doable suggestions might get overlooked and miss inclusion in the final version, which I think you agree, is something that should be avoided.</p>
<p>So Text, what’s the process you want us to follow at this point?</p>

</aside>
<p>Re-iteration is perfectly fine as long as people don’t assume that because they’ve said it twice, it’s definitely going to be fixed. I can handle the amount of feedback in terms of processing it, it’s just a bit too much to all write about, ya know? I always check carefully through every post written since the last version before I publish another version, I know what I’ve missed and what I want. It’s fine, don’t worry about it. I like the feedback.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. I’ll address your concerns.</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m not sure what the problem is here. I don’t see it.</li>
<li>Maybe, maybe. Not too sure.</li>
<li>The columns are all damaged because there are only 3 usable models for them, the least damaged of which is the one I use everywhere. Nothing I can do about it, I’m afraid, I need a modeller to sort that out. I suppose I could make brush based columns, but it’s a bit of a waste of time and resources for very little reward. Connecting them with an elevated rectangle is a nice idea.</li>
<li>Will fix this. Just forgot to align them properly.</li>
<li>Can fix this.</li>
<li>It doesn’t look great, but I don’t think it looks bad. Again, I’ve made do with what I’ve been given. I quite like the different coloured concrete textures, they match the floor textures inside. The HL2 windows are the worst part I agree - but it’s a necessary evil. Brush based windows would look terrible (AND unbroken!) there. I may give it a try, but I doubt it’ll work.</li>
<li>That’s intentional. But I can make the transition much nicer, and I will.</li>

<p>The failure message on the TOW courtyard will be a SERIOUS pain in the ass to implement, as grenade_tows do not have any outputs apart from the User inputs/outputs. I’d have to use trigger_multiple (updating every half second or so), tied to math_counter, tied to filter_activator_name, tied to the 3 entities required to have that failure message. It’s a fairly complex I/O setup, and fills an already extremely full BSP. I’m still not sure it’s worth it. I’ll probably end up doing it though, but I don’t like it. It’s safeguarding against a ridiculously unlikely eventuality.</p>

<p>Perhaps an easier solution would be to have the Agrunts bust down the door after a set period of time (~3.5 min) if the door isn’t destroyed by the TOW, as you wouldn’t have to couple this directly to the launcher.  However I do think the failure notice is the best solution and if you can conceiveably pull this off, then this is the way to go.  As for “rediculously unlikely,” maybe “fairly unlikely” is a more accurate statement.  You already encouraged random TOW use by making the M35 destructible and the player could conceivably expend at least a few shots on other things (e.g. the large vehicle, the other door).  In any case, it’s a very bad idea to strand the player, even if unlikely, as it suggests poor game design.</p>

<p>I don’t really get your objections to the LAV fight changes either. It sometimes strikes me that you like to say things in the previous version were better…just for the sake of it. It’s far superior now. The Marines from the bunker splitting up, as they did before, made very little sense and resulted in them getting smashed as individually they are weak against the swarms of aliens. Why would THEY split up, anyway? As for the Marines at the helipad charging down, I agree it’s not ideal…but it’s not terrible, either. He’s rushing down to help his friends survive. It’s a sacrifice. I didn’t plan on it happening but I quite liked it when it did. It’s a dumb decision. But it’s a little bit of humanity too. Human beings make dumb decisions, soldier or not. I might change it, I may not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hah, I don’t say previous versions are better “just for the sake of it.”  Perhaps a more accurate statement is that the current execution is flawed.  The two easily fixable issues here are to keep the defending marine still and position the bunker medic in the rear group, both of which I think you should do, as none of these changes would affect balance.</p>
<p>From a functional standpoint, I get why the bunker marines need to stay together and stay mobile. The rapid fire secondary of the Agrunts can easily focus them down if they’re static, which will affect DPS and heavily tip the battle to the aliens.  The problem here is that it’s unrealistic for them to run into point blank range of the aliens and this is also somewhat inconsistent w/their behavior in the rest of BMS.  Perhaps a better solution would be to script them w/strafing patterns or at least more lateral movements.  Their mobility should keep the current balance w/o compromising realism.</p>

The two door buttons in this alley don’t have any access denied sound like the rest of these same type of door buttons do in the maps.</p>

As others posted, the bloodstain on the wall where the marine gets tossed is there the entire time before he gets tossed. Honestly, I would recommend just deleting it entirely as the body actually hits much lower than where the blood spot is (or move it down) and it doesn’t really look that great.</p>

The missing fire in the satchel scene. Just leaving this here so you remember to add it in. It would really make the reason for the glow of the satchel pipe more clear and frankly the fire up top doesn’t really make sense coming out of nowhere. Also taking damage when going under it doesn’t make a lot of sense as you can’t see any sign of there being gas or steam as seen in the pic.</p>

I have been forgetting to mention this for a few versions. This light makes a really obnoxiously  loud ambient sound. Could you turn it down by about half volume?</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7qyfb.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/7qyfb.jpg</a><br>
Again I really think you should make the explosive boxes by this antenna trigger the sequence of the antenna falling down when they die. When I went and jumped in the water this play-through the garg stomped over the boxes killing them. For a new player this would leave them with no real visual clue as to what to do next. Either make the boxes indestructible to everything except the mortar or make them set off the sequence when destroyed. Also make them UN-movable if you can.</p>
<p>Other stuff:<br>
I like that you made the humvee destructible, but I think you should also add an explosion sound when it dies. If you toss a grenade by it and it blows up it seems really odd without any explosion sound if it’s own. If there isn’t one for the vehicle you shoot with the TOW add one for that as well.</p>
<p>I also noticed when no-cliping past the satchel sequence that the marine actually says something along the lines of “really is that all”. You never hear him say this playing regularly, at least I never have or somehow didn’t notice it after all of the times playing that part. Maybe move that audio a little closer inside the pipe so you get the chance to hear it.</p>
<p>I know how much you’ve said you hate escort quests, but I too would like to throw in that I think the barney part should be one. This is how it was in the original and really it’s just a perfect part for that sort of thing. It would make it so you can’t simply run past everything and hit that button, but rather have to work with barney to kill the remaining aliens and the ones that spawn in with the 50cal. Also if barney does die at this part a player can be left not knowing what to do exactly. The button in the security booth doesn’t stand out at all as it just looks like a normal model of a console, there’s no obvious switch or lever to pull. Maybe just make the switch more obvious somehow and not have it be an escort quest.</p>
<p>This will very likely be the last post of issues I do unless I happen to play the maps again before release. Good luck with the final version and getting on the dev team. I think you certainly should start a thread somewhere on these forums asking for players to rally for these maps to be officially added to the mod. At least make a post in the cafeteria announcing the completion of the maps as a lot of people probably don’t come to these smaller sub-sections of the forums compared to the cafeteria. Oh and keep us updated after release on if you ever plan to do OaR additions or other projects. Cheers</p>
