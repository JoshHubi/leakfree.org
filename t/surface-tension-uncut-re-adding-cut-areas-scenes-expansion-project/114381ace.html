<p>'Fraid you’ve misunderstood me here. I’m not locking the hut. I’m designing it like how C2A5D was designed. The hut is open, and there is a locked console (red button) inside. When Barney hits the master switch in the security station, the green traffic light comes on and the console turns green. Pressing the button on this console allows you to open the doors. This is how it was in C2A5D so it’s consistent and makes sense from a gameplay and realism perspective. Having the hut locked really doesn’t make much of a difference - there are windows anyway so the player could just climb in.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is fine as I’m big on consistency.  Plus it forces the player to fight at the .50 cal instead of running away, which is really the main issue.  One thing I will note though is that having an unlocked door means the 3 marines that spawn will sometimes run into the hut and fight from there, which adds a bit more variability to the battle than would otherwise be there.  When this happens, it tends to favor the HECU.</p>

<p>Glad we agree on the script. I won’t refine it any further as I think it’s fine too, overthinking it won’t really help.</p>
<p>As for the unlocked door meaning the marines going into the shack, that was actually a bug, and a very stupid one at that, caused by the bane of the programmer: THE TYPO. The 3 marines (named c2a5h_abrams_rein_grunt01, c2a5h_abrams_rein_grunt02, and c2a5h_abrams_rein_grunt03) that spawn at the side are supposed to rush out onto the street, via the rallypoints c2a5h_abrams_rein_rally2, 3 and 4. Note the discrepancy in numbers. This happened because I originally had 4 Marines and 4 Rallypoints, and I deleted Marine 4 and deleted Rallypoint 1 (positioning reasons). When the time came around to assign the marines to their assaults via I/O, I forgot this little discrepancy, resulting in grunt01 being assigned to rally01, which didn’t exist. So, he just did whatever the heck he liked, which was normally running into that shack and messing up the AI completely. It’s fixed now, they all rush out as intended.</p>

          <p>Just tweaking and tweaking and tweaking and tweaking the Abrams battle now, as that’s the fight in most dire need of an overhaul.</p>
<p>It’s REMARKABLE how ridiculously inconsistent the outcomes of the battles are, it really is.</p>
<p>I’m getting closer and closer though. It’s the best it’s ever been and I’m hoping to have by the end of this mapping session, consistently 1 - 2 alien survivors TOPS.</p>
<p>On my last test, however, the results were:</p>
<p>SURVIVORS AFTER THE FIGHT HAD FINISHED COMPLETELY (Notarget on)<br>
Fight 1: 2 Vorts, 2 Alien Grunts<br>
Fight 2: 4 Marines (!!)<br>
Fight 3: 2 Marines<br>
Fight 4: 1 Vort, 1 Alien Grunt<br>
Fight 5: 2 Alien Grunts<br>
Fight 6: 5 Marines (!!)<br>
Fight 7: 2 Vorts, 1 Alien Grunt</p>
<p>And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The fights seem to be roughly 50/50 in terms of who wins. However I’ve observed that when the marines win it tends to be by a large amount. Still working on it, getting closer!</p>
<p>I’ve actually toned down the numbers a little from previous versions.</p>
<p>EDIT: Getting much closer. I’ve pretty much got it so that the Aliens win every time, with 3 - 4 survivors. I might call it a day there after more tests to confirm reliability.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Nope. But I’m still making progress. It’s about 70/30 for Aliens. About 20% of the fights I tested were won by significant numbers. It is now more likely that there will be significant numbers of aliens than significant numbers of marines, which IS better but still not ideal. A big part of the problem is the way the AI aliens behave against the Marines. For some reason both Vorts and Grunts will ALWAYS try to close the distance for a melee attack. This results in them catching ridiculous numbers of bullets before they even attempt to attack their opponent properly. The other problem is they get “flinched” by bullets from the Marine’s MP5. That is, if they’re swinging a melee at them and even 1 single bullet from a Marine’s MP5 connects with them, they restart the animation. It’s a technique used in games to simulate flinching from pain, but in this case it just results in the aliens making 30 attempted swings at their opponent and then dying. It’s a very annoying behaviour, and it’s a shame, because if their AI was a little more advanced, I wouldn’t have anything like as much trouble balancing it. There’s also NOTHING I can do to prevent these behaviours, really, short of making battle lines the AIs can’t cross, which then eliminates melee entirely, which is also stupid.</p>
<p>Still, I’m progressing. I’m going to bed now but hopefully by tomorrow I’ll have that fight NAILED. I’ve already made the timings much tighter, and reduced the number of NPCs active at once (should save some frames), without hurting the scope of the fight significantly.</p>

          <p>The dialogue looks perfect now. I thought you didn’t know how to make the new animations and stuff though, did you figure it out or find someone to do it to make the new ones?</p>
<p>That melee bug sounds like the same thing the vorts and grunts try to do the the LAV when they survive. They run up to it and try to melee it and the LAV can’t shoot them anymore so it ends up looking really strange. Also if the only thing left from that fight is the LAV and it just sits there it seems odd. Maybe you could have another scripted sequence of it going somewhere if it lives or having that manta come back and beam it to death as well.</p>

          <p>Can’t you keep track of how many marines/aliens are in the battle and spawn more aliens as needed? This way you could exacly determine the outcome of a battle.<br>
Just make sure the initial number of aliens is war too low for them to win.</p>

          <p>This is my first post here. So please forgive me if I’m out of place.</p>
<p>Concerning the security guard that follows you from the control and supervisor office (what’s being referred to as an security station) in the gas works building to the snark vent leading to the Garg chase. Also how though HECU forces have access to both sides (as well as vehicles being on both side) of the vehicle pass through door at the far end of the tank courtyard by the guard shack (what’s being referred to as a check point or security hut) in map bm_c2a5h, yet have setup an 50cal emplacement on the road blocking the door (I’d hate to be the guy to man that position moving the same hundred or so sandbags back and forth all day everytime someone brought a vehicle through).</p>
<p>I think the easiest to address both of these would be as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>keep the existing dialog, facial animations and current location of the 50cal emplacement.</li>
<li>restore the keypad door in the guard shack by the 50cal emplacement, to as it was in version.81. Including how guard unlocks it at his desk from within the control room where you first meet him.</li>
<li>once you and the guard pass through that keypad door in the guard shack into the area with the M35 truck, the guard processed to the opposite end of the area where there is another door.</li>
<li>change that door to a locked keypad door.</li>
<li>once the guard uses that door (makes motions to unlock it) , he dies (is electrocuted), the doors keypad shorts out.</li>
<li>for more emphasis, add an auto turret or an laser trip mine to the area.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should simplify the reason as to why the security guard doesn’t follow you any further. Without having to add new dialog and facial animations (or changing his existing ones as of version.82).<br>
And add a little further explaination/emphasis as to why the HECU setup that 50cal emplacement on the road blocking access to the door and to the Lambda site. That being that they had no intentions to use the door as a pass through and had rigged that keypad that killed the security guard or anyone else that tried to use it.<br>
And so, the player must find an alturnate way through to Lambda on his own. Which leads him to the snark vent (the shroud above the vent makes accessing the vent without falling compicated, for me that is) up the stairwell in map bm_c2a5i, prior to the 2nd Garg chase.</p>
<p>Well, so far I think this project is turning out great! Keep up the good work.<br>
P.s. I hope that I was being clear enough.</p>

          <p>Sorry to be late. Here’s my .03 worth. Suggested changes underlined.</p>
<ol>
<li>[Mixture of surprise and relief] I’ll be damned. Gordon Freeman. You actually made it through that hellhole! [Gets a little frantic, looking at his screens, sees a fight between HECU and Aliens] Shit’s seriously hitting the fan now…the military’s getting hammered <span class="bbcode-u">everywhere</span>! If I didn’t know better, I’d almost feel sorry for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is regarding that multiple monitors are showing the military loosing multiple battles.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I can let you through, now that I know it’s clear. It’s a short walk down the main access tunnel and then just follow the road <span class="bbcode-u">to the gate</span>. If our plan worked, the lockdown will have kept both the freaks and the assholes out. There shouldn’t be anything too big and nasty along the way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow the road to where? Need to state a destination.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>When these military assholes started poking around, me and [sounds a bit mournful] some buddies of mine activated the security lockdown, hoping to block off all access to the Lambda bunker. When we realized you might actually make it here, we tried to hold this position…[mournful again] <span class="bbcode-u">unsuccessfully, I’m afraid</span> [glances over to his fallen comrade in the corner].</li>
</ol>
<p>“not entirely successfully” doesn’t sound right, two words with the same ending, nor does it role off the tongue so easily. Your Vox performer might have an issue with this as well.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<span class="bbcode-u">Ahhh</span>, damn it [heavy emphasis, sounds quite pissed off]. Our last fight was a real mess; this thing’s fried. All I’ve been able to do is unlock the console in the guard house by the tunnel. We’ll <span class="bbcode-u">be able to open the gate from there.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“Ahhh” seems better than “Grrr”. Barney is not a rabid dog. Or maybe “God damn it”, since he’s been under a lot of stress. The last sentence is just a re-worded clarification.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>I’ll help you out 'till I’m sure you can carry on safely <span class="bbcode-u">by yourself</span>. Then I’ll come back here and <span class="bbcode-u">lockdown</span> everything behind you so you <span class="bbcode-u">can’t</span> be followed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Says the same thing using less word-count. Using “lockdown” to tie-in with its previous usage.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>There ya go, <span class="bbcode-u">Doc</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Makes their relationship more personable/friendlier.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>This is as far as I go, buddy. I’ll double back [gestures behind him] and <span class="bbcode-u">lockdown</span> everything again once you’re home free. Good luck out there, ya hear me? Bring me back a <span class="bbcode-u">cold</span> 6 pack when this is all over!</li>
</ol>
<p>Added “lockdown” for consistency. Removed “up”, not needed. Removed “on the” from “on the home free”. Never heard that phrase before. Is it the British version of “home free”? Lastly, I know you Brits usually prefer your beer warm, but us North Americans prefer ours COLD!</p>
<p>Use all, parts or none. It’s your mod, so it’s your call.</p>

          <p>First, I’d like to say that you have done a fantastic job so far. It’s really looking great. I can’t wait to see how this turns out. This part of story had some memorable moments that was missing from the Black Mesa release and I would definitely like to have this either integrated into Black Mesa or available as optional pack. So, please take as much time as you’re willing to commit to this.  From what I can tell, most of the bugs and concerns that I was having been fixed and others have been stated some of the remaining. If there’s something that someone else brought up earlier, I’m sorry since i haven’t read every post and I’ll try to give add abit more to it. I’ll try to be as specific as possible, and address issues via the order in which I played through the level. I don’t have many additional bugs to report, so most of the points here are either observational or cosmetic. I will continue to appreciate textfamguys work regardless</p>
<p>Map - bm_c2a5g</p>
<p>1 - The Parking Building;<br>
I really like what you have done here.<br>
a) the vending machines are a nice addition, however there are 2 soda machines on one level, 2 snack machines on another level. Change this to one of each on each level. Also, (this has been stated Wangman I think) the vending machine are in a bad/unsafe location, place the vending machines by the stairwell. Maybe recede them into the wall.<br>
b) as far as i have noticed all the lights seem to be on despite the damage to the building. Change a quarter or more of the lights to be either missing, off, or flickering.<br>
c) the 2nd story windows which look out towards the car shop and overlooks the alley. Both can be looked out of and noted that there are no npc’s down in the alley way. Neither can the player hear any npc’s from here. Not only can the player throw objects through the windows. But the player can climb through the window on the left (with some effort), jump safely down into the alley, climb the ladder into the airduct and make it to the car shop scene, without triggering the alley way HECU v Alien fight and if the player chooses to do so skip the 3rd story entirely. While wasting no extra ammo, health, power and or time. Make it so that the player can no longer pass through these windows.<br>
• (suggestion only). I never understood the how or why of the marines ended up in or what they were doing in that closed off alley in the first HL. Could be explain with a short dialog that could be triggered near the windows.<br>
Marine 1, “we’re locked in”. Marine 2, “$@#! this place is a big &amp;$@ maze”. Radio, “(call sign), where the #&amp;?! are you guys”. Marine, “ah sir?., we’re lost…”. Radio “yeah! Well get yourselves un-lost, understood?” Marine, “yes sir…”.<br>
Or if the simper fi dialog could be cleaned up as so that it doesn’t sound like it’s over the radio only chatter. Perhaps truncated abit with a short comment about the path being a dead end or being trapped added to the end.</p>
<p>2 - the Car Shop.<br>
a) the med station and fire extinguisher in the corner by the rigged door are a bit higher on the wall than Black Mesa standard. Roughly by one brick I think.<br>
b) (i think that this has been pointed out before) the marines both inside and outside in the tow courtyard seem to be non-active (and have no generic idle or alert dialog) until the player comes to within their line of sight. Despite dialog/scene suggesting that they know that the player or some other non-HECU npc is there.<br>
c) currently, there are two coolant drums, but next to no oil in the car shop. Add an oil drum or two, or change one of the coolant drums to an oil drum. But don’t place the oil drum near the side with the rigged door.</p>
<p>3 - The Tow Courtyard.<br>
a) regarding the vista, there seems to be one or more powerline towers w/powerlines and an oversized out-of-place tree right next to the flight strip by the harriers’ point of origin, using noclip should confirm this. Also, while looking at that area of the vista with noclip on and turning to the right there is another flight strip that also has a powerline tower w/powerlines near one end. These should be removed.<br>
b) (suggestion only) dialog over the radio by at the tow emplacement such as “(call sign) come in,  (call sign) we’re showing 4 (Alien Grunts) headed towards your position, do you read me? Over…” “$#%&amp;, where the %#@ is everyone?”, would seem to me to be more fitting. Parts of the simper fi dialog could also be used in place of the last line here and/or elsewhere but, otherwise wouldn’t normally be used over an open comm channel for general chat.</p>
<p>4 - Osprey Courtyard.<br>
a) (suggestion only) have the LAV come all of the way out of its tunnel (though not as far as it did in version.81) and have the doors close behind it. The tunnel doesn’t go anywhere, there’s nothing in it and it takes time for the player to check it out to only to find nothing.<br>
b) considering the right side of the Osprey courtyard, as viewed from where you enter at. In both the near and the far corner, there is a corner fence in these corners that covers a very small gap between buildings/walls. Remove these fences and close the gap by either adjusting the placement of the buildings/walls or by placing a small fence so that it only spans the gap at the gap instead of the corner.<br>
c) as for the Osprey gibs. Near the end of map bm_c2a5f where the player is encouraged to destroy the Osprey that infinitely brings in marines. That Ospreys’ gibs cause the player no damage. However (This bug has been stated in another thread I believe), there is a weird physics bug in the area that sometimes causes the gibs to toss the player into the air and also sometimes will make other interactive objects in the area bob through the ground as if the ground were water.<br>
In these uncut bm_c2a5g versions. The player can crawl bump and push the gibs without taking any damage (at least for me) and the player can stand on the gibs without take any additional damage after first contact until they move again.<br>
Also, in the gibs_manifest.txt in the scripts folder, the Ospreys fuselage gib is commented out.</p>

<p>Can’t you keep track of how many marines/aliens are in the battle and spawn more aliens as needed? This way you could exacly determine the outcome of a battle.<br>
Just make sure the initial number of aliens is war too low for them to win.</p>

</aside>
<p>Though this idea is extremely complicated to implement (fully dynamic spawns are a total pain in the ass to pull off) it did give me an excellent idea for balancing the fight, so I appreciate the input!</p>
<p>I’m going to start using a dynamic math_counter and logic_case combination to track survivors by the time wave 4 (the final wave) of the tank battle starts.</p>
<p>One set counts the alien survivors by the time wave 4 begins, one tracks human survivors.</p>
<p>I can then use the logic_case to determine what EXTRA to spawn ontop of the usual wave 4. For example if there are lots of alien survivors and no human survivors, I can set it to spawn an extra human or two in another position, and vice versa. It’s a nice balance system.</p>
<p>To get it working however, I had to be sorta mathematically precise. So I counted out all the current combatant numbers. Figured I’d post them here as they’re kinda (sorta maybe?) interesting.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to write feedback, I appreciate it. I read all feedback I receive on here and I definitely take it in, but you’ll understand if I don’t have the time to reply point-to-point. I have a busy life at university and pretty much all my free time is going into this project - if I spend all my time addressing points I won’t have anytime to map!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I’ll say a few things.</p>
<p>I’ve already addressed the way that scene will work - I always wanted to have better dialogue for that bit anyway. It’s just a case of whether Kevin Sisk will say yes or no to my request, and I certainly wouldn’t bet on it. It wasn’t just a case of making the ending make sense, the new dialogue I think makes the mapset makes sense and provides a nice amount of exposition.</p>
<p>As for your C2A5G criticisms, I read them all, and do not necessarily agree with all of them.</p>
<p>The Osprey bug is weird as hell. I can’t get my head around it. I know it doesn’t happen on C2A5F, I don’t understand why it happens here. I’m thinking it has something to do with it being triggered by I/O but that’s just a guess. At first I thought that me using the “sethealth 0” input to kill the Osprey might have bugged out the pieces, so I used “break” instead, which is what I do on the Abrams in C2A5H, which works perfectly fine. Except break doesn’t work on the Osprey properly, it doesn’t respond to it. So weird.</p>
<p>Your other complaints are generally small ones and I HAVE taken them on board, however the ones about adding new dialogue aren’t feasible. I’m already uncomfortable enough about contacting Mr. Sisk to get him to record dialogue, and I’m already fairly certain he’ll say no, I don’t want to go to the trouble of setting it up with the marines either.</p>

<p>The other problem is they get “flinched” by bullets from the Marine’s MP5. That is, if they’re swinging a melee at them and even 1 single bullet from a Marine’s MP5 connects with them, they restart the animation. It’s a technique used in games to simulate flinching from pain, but in this case it just results in the aliens making 30 attempted swings at their opponent and then dying. It’s a very annoying behaviour, and it’s a shame, because if their AI was a little more advanced, I wouldn’t have anything like as much trouble balancing it. There’s also NOTHING I can do to prevent these behaviours, really, short of making battle lines the AIs can’t cross, which then eliminates melee entirely, which is also stupid.</p>

          <p>Just as a small pointer on writing dialog for the game-</p>
<p>When you hand it off to VAs, I’d recommend getting rid of the excess description of dialog mood. If your VA is good (and the BM actors/actresses were REALLY good) then they should be able to organically establish a tone for the scene just by working with your dialog. Sometimes they can make a scene better than you originally intended.</p>
<p>Plus, it saves on space, making for cleaner dialog. I’d recommend putting it in screenplay format with software like “Celtx” when you have a forwardable dialog piece for the VA.</p>
<p>As for the bit where you want Barney to be escortable, I’d have some dialog covering either instance- if you leave him behind he tells you something like “Judging by what I saw on the feeds, you can handle yourself out there. I’ll let the Lambda team know you’re on the way. Good luck out there, Gordon. You’re gonna need it.”</p>
<p><em>turns to console and loops dialog following</em></p>
<p>“Security Checkpoint Delta to Lambda Team. Lambda Complex Team, do you read?”<br>
(Similar to the rebel contacting New Little Odessa in HL2)</p>

          <p>While I don’t know what causes the Osprey gib damage bug, I have a (rather dirty) workaround.<br>
ent_dump’ing the gibs in your map revealed a strangely huge spawnflags keyvalue. I wrote it down and compared it to one obtained in a small test map, where the gibs don’t cause damage. Results were:<br>
spawnflags = 4227600 -&gt; gives damage<br>
spawnflags = 4196100 -&gt; no damage<br>
That’s a big number too, and it is larger than any flag mentioned for prop_physics in the FGD, but setting the damaging gib’s spawnflags value to 4196100 helps. This needs to be done when the Osprey is being destroyed.<br>
I included a small test map that illustrates the opposite: Making harmless gibs damage the player. The map also contains a dynamic reinforcement battle (3 aliens survive) I made earlier today, but I see you already implemented the idea <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

That’s a big number too, and it is larger than any flag mentioned for prop_physics in the FGD, but setting the damaging gib’s spawnflags value to 4196100 helps. This needs to be done when the Osprey is being destroyed.<br>
I included a small test map that illustrates the opposite: Making harmless gibs damage the player. The map also contains a dynamic reinforcement battle (3 aliens survive) I made earlier today, but I see you already implemented the idea <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

<p>Thanks for investigating this, your knowledge of how to manipulate entities and how all that works seems to be far above mine (though I definitely get the gist of what your fix does, how you worked it out is a whole other matter). I took a look at your testmap and I see very clearly how your fix works and how it might work on my map, so I’ll try and implement it now and see if it fixes it. It’s a dirty workaround for a dirty problem, but it’s better than no workaround, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking this up (I’m extremely confident this will fix it). This bug was probably the biggest pain in the ass out of all of them.</p>
<p>As for your dynamic reinforcements thingy, that’s an EXTREMELY complicated entity setup compared to the one I’m using, and I’m not sure if it’s better. Mine is simply 2 math_counters and 2 logic_cases. One math_counter counts human survivors, one math_counter counts alien survivors. It then simply determines the amount of extra units added for the FINAL reinforcement wave (wave 4). Wave 4 is the most important round to balance obviously as it determines what units you’re left to fight against. I’ve been testing it today and it works really well and it’s definitely a simpler, more crude solution. But I sure as hell like it!</p>
<p>Still, thanks for finding out about the spawnflags for me. I will try it now. Really appreciate it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yep, worked like a charm. Brilliant. Thanks for the fix, will definitely credit you for it as that one’s been making me pull out my hair. The only thing I noticed is that the spawnflags value also affected the ragdolls for dead HECU present within the trigger_multiple, which is certainly a potential issue. But, as far as I could tell, it doesn’t have any VISIBLE impact in the game on them, they still behave in the same way as they always do, so I’m hoping it’ll be alright. I guess the alternative would be to use filter_multiple to filter out ragdolls as well as allowing gibs, but it seems overly complicated for something which doesn’t seem to cause any problems. I will implement that if we have any problem with the ragdolls, however.</p>

          <p>Maybe a bit late since tank battle is nearly balanced but it might be amusing to have an Agrunt spawn on the bathroom rooftop and fling the marine to his death.  The rooftop spawn position give a huge edge to w/e is up there as the marine usually always survives in an HECU victory.</p>

This is assuming you haven’t fixed the bug where they just stand in front of the vehicle and look stupid.</p>

And yes, using an additional filter to only allow prop_physics would make sure you are on the safe side. A workaround for the workaround, indeed.</p>

<p>There’s a work around for that, just attach a script to the LAV to take damage from Vort attacks. If you do do that, be sure to make sure it reads the “sk_alien_slave_dmg_zap” or something value marked by the player. I forget the exact command.</p>
<p>Basically, have it set up so it looks at the damage taken (or reflected), if it’s a vort zap, then simply damage the entity by the value read in the sk_ command.</p>

          <p>OK, these are the last 3 things that I have noticed. You guys seem to be on everything else.</p>
<p>in Map bm_c2a5h</p>
<p>Bug</p>
<p>When the player plays from map 5g the floating red light is still present at the players point of origin in the security scan hallway. However, the red light is not present if the player loads map 5h through the console.<br>
Also of interest here is that the zombie security guard is present when plays from map 5g, but is missing when you load map 5h with the console? Don’t know if that will help any…</p>
<p>Safety and work site accident prevention. (Optional)</p>
<p>1 - Furnace Room, bottom floor.</p>
<p>thin pipes running horizontally at about jump height across the room would;<br>
a) make placement and retrieval of drums at the drum storage area precarious for fictional workers to do so without the risk of injury and or damage to pipes or drums.<br>
b) present an obstacle for fictional workers on the opposite side of the room when trying escape the room through the front door (which connects to the front right side office) in the event of a out of control fire.<br>
• suggestion<br>
a) rotate the pipes from laying side by side horizontally to a vertical stack configuration and move to the back wall.<br>
b) provide either a extra wide or double emergency fire door on the same wall that drum storage area sign is on and place a fire extinguisher by them.<br>
These will provide the fictional workers on the opposite side of the room an optional and un-obstructed path for exiting the building at the side alley (near the jump pads) in the event of an emergency. As well as more room to work.</p>
<p>2 - the Gas Works building.</p>
<p>a) When exiting the utility room where you entered the building via the broken pipe, if the player turns left to look at the big roll up door that the M35 is currently facing, the player will notice a small pipe that branches out in front of that door a few units before elbowing down into the road. This small pipe section should be removed.<br>
b) inorder for the fictional worker to pass to or from the main floor of the building to the small utility room, the worker must carefully walk over a span of pipes that lay horizontally just above ground level that are present between the utility room and the pass through road on the main floor of the building. It currently looks as if a marine came across this realization the hard way.<br>
Also, since these pipes run parallel next to the road these pipes are unprotected from vehicles that regularly pass through the building using this road.</p>
<p>Just thinking about their safety! Not that the Black Mesa Research Facility is too concerned about that. lol</p>

<p>Tried it, it works well. Having the Agrunt up there also makes it much harder for the humans to win by fluke, without me having to resort to using large numbers of aliens.</p>
<p>The fight’s pretty balanced, it just needs minute changes now, just very minor adjustments. It’s the most balanced it’s been by far and it’s almost at what I would call “close to perfect”.</p>
<p>For 0.83 I’ve basically given C2A5H the overhaul treatment I gave C2A5G on the previous version. All the blander areas have been spruced up a fair amount (the rooftop and road leading away from gasworks in particular), and I’ve been polishing up the particle effects and addressing major complaints. This is definitely a large step up from the previous C2A5H.</p>

<p>I’m glad it worked.<br>
And yes, using an additional filter to only allow prop_physics would make sure you are on the safe side. A workaround for the workaround, indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have made it so the spawnflags trigger is filtered to disallow ragdolls. I figured it has the same effect as only allowing physics props anyway.</p>

<p>There’s a work around for that, just attach a script to the LAV to take damage from Vort attacks. If you do do that, be sure to make sure it reads the “sk_alien_slave_dmg_zap” or something value marked by the player. I forget the exact command.</p>
<p>Basically, have it set up so it looks at the damage taken (or reflected), if it’s a vort zap, then simply damage the entity by the value read in the sk_ command.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know if this is possible. I can set a damage filter to ALLOW the LAV to receive certain damage types, but I can’t remember or not if the ALLOW filter means ALLOW ONLY, or just ALLOW (on top of everything else). If it’s the former, I can’t do it as it means that’ll be the only thing which can damage the LAV. If it’s the latter, I will do it. I’ll have to test it out when I get a chance. I also highly doubt the damage type for the Vort’s Zap is called “sk_alien_slave_dmg_zap,” as that’s just the console variable modifier. The actual damage type should be named much simpler than that (for example, a tow projectile is grenade_tow).</p>

<p>I’m afraid neither of your concerns are particularly easy to fix, as the pipesystem I’ve got running across the floors are a single model, which I’m very loathe to replace or move. This is because having it as that single, huge model (from Apprehension) is a very efficient way of rendering it, the alternative would be to use literally 10-15 separate pipe models to achieve the same effect, which would drastically increase rendering cost.</p>
<p>I can probably do something about safety concern 1 without adjusting the pipes, I’ll take a look at it. As for number 2, I’m not sure there’s anything I can do about that.</p>
<p>Thanks for voicing your concerns, I’ll see what I can do!</p>

<p>Hey Zerald try to write in console “mat_specular 0” and see if that red light dissappears.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think the red light has anything to do with specularity, though I don’t actually know what causes it. Though I can’t precisely figure it out, the light appears EITHER at the world’s origin (which is in that room in roughly that location) or the location of the info_landmark (the transitioning entity). I’ve also seen this problem on official Black Mesa maps (I saw it on C3A1B, the second Forget About Freeman map), so there must be a root cause. I’ll see what I can do but I need to find out what’s causing it first. It’s not necessarily caused by the level transition either. When I load up C2A5H from the console after creating a new build, and the map loads and it starts to build the nodegraph (as it always does on a new compile) that light is visible while the game’s compiling the nodegraph. When the nodegraph has finished, the light disappears. THEN the only time you see it is from a transition. Weird.</p>
