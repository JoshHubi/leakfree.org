<p>Spiral driveways in the garage feel uneven when walking them, like you also mentioned in the playthrough video.<br>
I think brushing them out as they are now took quite a lot of time (all vertices seem to be on-grid, did you do that all by hand?).</p>
<p>But what about doing the driveways this way?<br>

<p>I couldn’t get the security guard to press the button at all. I have reloaded the scene a few times but he will only stand there. Asking him to follow works but he won’t do anything a regular unscripted guard wouldn’t do. I don’t think I’m doing anything out of the ordinary in approaching him… through the window and down the stairs like everyone else.</p>

          <p>I think the reason people are saying these maps are so hard  is that its alot of stiff challenge layered back to back, rather than buffering a light few hard moments with alot of less difficult ones.  That isnt to say that I have a problem with any of your big encounters, but i feel like a few of the lighter ones could use to be a little lighter to create a better curve.</p>
<p>This is a thing that alot of mappers do is design maps arround their own skill level, but I feel like you’re expecting players to use tactics that the game hasnt actually presented them with proper training for.  You are better than the average player.  BMS’s devs realised this the hard way when a majority of their players complained that marines were too strong (they were made stronger in BMS) and crouch jumping is used too often.  Both of these being decisions that are easy to make when you’re desining for a game you’re really fuckin good at, balance is just the tricky thing.</p>
<p>Your maps do alot right, but they do make a few of these mistakes in spots.  A big problem pro and amateur mappers fall into is “filling a room with a hard thing so it isnt empty”  I think the first set of vort waves is completely pointless.  You can just run past them, the only reason they’re there is to give you a thing to do with the turret, but you cover that beat again later in the map, and better.  That is not a point in the game where we even need a challenge, its building up to the parkinglot battle and the outdoors battle, right after the dropship battle.  Its not a good encounter and could be stripped out for redundancy.  Just have like…the first wave of vorts and remove the other 2 waves.  They’re simple to mechanically exploit, and the way they spawn in feels robotic.  (i think you use turrets in a weird way.  I never knew that crouching  didnt disengage you from the turret, and i doubt an average player will figure that out without being told so)</p>
<p>I think you throw a few too many snarks at the player right before the bathroom.  it just feels like filler.  Snarks arent used much in the game because they’re a poor encounter and are only there to set up the idea of the weapon.  using a few snarks wouldnt be that big of a gameplay problem, but the bathroom encounter with them just isnt interesting or fun.  They dont show up close enough to the acquisition of the bee launcher for it to feel like a natural tutorial, and just feels unneeded for there to be so many of them.</p>
<p>Again I really like this mod and what its doing, these are just my most critical observations after playing it.  overall you’re doing alot of great stuff, I just feel like the snark encounter and the first set of vort waves dont have good game feel.  The first vort waves feel robotic and exploitable after the first wave, and the overabundance of snarks in an area that doesnt give you room to dodge them end up making those two encounters sort of “stinkers”  (I like the vort waves you encounter towards the end of the map though)</p>
<p>the big battles you’re shooting for are great, amd have good feel.  the snark and first vorts encounter just need tweaking.  (Maybe just remove the third wave of vorts, and make the second wave just be one or two, to add a little dynamicness to the situation, without adding too much and feeling robotic.  if you run past them and open the door they just run for the battle in the next room automatically)</p>
<p>I like the barrels in the sniper section, you can use them for cover and just hold them infront of you and the sniper.  (its how i deal with portal turrets and is a great valvey thing)  I feel like the steam hitboxes in the jumping puzzel at the end are still just a little bit too big, i’m getting hit when i dont think I should.  A good rule of hitboxes I’ve found is always make damaging hitboxes a little bit smaller than they appear.  catch the player in a mistake, not in finesse errors.</p>

          <p>I don’t find his maps to be all that difficult, but after testing them so many times and knowing what happens next at every part it becomes harder to judge how hard it actually is for first time players.</p>
<p>When BM came out I played through the whole mod on Hard and I remember at the part right after killing that tank with the TOW I had barely any health. Maybe 15-25 health and zero suit power. If you go from that into his maps the parking garage scene could be a little difficult, but I still think after one or two deaths you would just let the battle play out and easily be able to pick off the survivors and then find health in the stairwells.</p>
<p>As for the vortigaunt turret sequence at the beginning, it does feel a little weird. This is of course a recreation of that part in the original half-life, however, in the original the turret was at the bottom of a slope and not at the top. The way it is now you can do that part on hard and take zero hits. I would suggest actually removing almost all of the cover from that turret to make that part a bit more fun and less monotonous. It is still too easy. Maybe put some extra health or suit power somewhere before this part so players coming from the tank battle in the previous map aren’t completely dead.</p>

<p>Ah, yeah, somehow half of my files were backed up backwards, with your files saved as the backups and the originals unchanged. Guard scene works now.</p>
<p>Now that I played it, I agree there should be something stopping you from running through to the next map before finishing the 50cal fight. How about this… recreate the double doors with the crank here (since you’re replacing the one after the garg with a simple button anyway, this won’t be repetitive). The security button could open them a crack and then fail (with a sparking animation or something to show that it’s busted) at which point you need to use the manual override crank. The crank would need to be somehow closed off until after you rescue Barney, but wide open to attack from the aliens so you have to deal with them first.</p>

          <p>The new version of the maps is looking and playing fantastically, particularly the parking garage scene. Also your attempts to optimise the maps have been a rousing success, as it ran like a dream with no crashes for me on my relatively low end laptop. Thanks again for all of your excellent work.</p>
<p>I just noticed a couple of things I thought were worth mentioning:</p>
<p>C25AG<br>
-The only thing I thought of for this chapter is that it would look better if you had a snack and drinks vending machine on each floor, rather than two snack machines on one floor and then two drinks machines on another. That way every floor caters for both hunger and thirst, no jogging to the next floor for full nourishment!</p>
<p>C2A5H<br>
-I think the textures for the male and female toilet signs here are a bit comically large, maybe decrease the size slightly so they are still noticeable but feel natural.<br>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152651" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152651</a></p>
<p>-The top left point of this ladder is clipping through the wall<br>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152557" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152557</a></p>
<p>-I am not sure what is happening with the hatch above the pipe entrance here, if it is meant to be something that closes over the entrance then the hinge is in the wrong place at the top and it needs to be reversed. Also there is clipping at the top. I don’t really think this hatch is necessary so the easiest solution would be to delete the hatch model.<br>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152599" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152599</a></p>
<p>-I know I mentioned this before and I wouldn’t bring it up again except that I think something relevant has changed in your maps. While previously I agree the red light on the satchel did highlight it more, the addition of the (excellent) furnace light now means the the red light disguises the satchel in amongst the background orange. I think no red light would allow the dark satchel to pop more by having it be silhouetted and thus make the situation clearer.<br>

<p>-Here are some clipping issues in the furnace room:<br>

<p>-On the stairs that join C2A5H to C2A5I there are some strange overlapping/clipping issues with the model of the railings on both sides of the stairs<br>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152235" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152235</a></p>
<p>C2A5I</p>
<p>-The vent dropping down here as it does always seemed odd to me, as there is no reason for it to made like that and actually if you look it would cause a hazard for trucks passing underneath it. Could you just have the flimsy grate at the same level as the rest of the vent, it would be just as unavoidable as far as I can see and drop players in the right place. Is there some reason I am not seeing (quite possible) that you need that vertical vent extension?<br>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152321" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=110152321</a></p>
<p>-These containers in the background near my reticle look cool, but I do wonder how such large crates could get behind that wall as there is no larger door to be seen anywhere or really any reason why that would be chosen as a suitable area for storage. The only option is being air lifted in, but that seems unlikely. Just seems odd.<br>

<p>Anyhoo, what do you think?</p>

          <p>Just played through the maps on hard for the first time. I died at a few places and then changed up how I was playing the part and got by in the next try almost every time. There were no places that seemed frustratingly hard to me, and in BM there were a few. I think they are pretty much on par with the rest of the mod in general difficulty wise.</p>
<p>Some new things I noticed:<br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/xd6Hf.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/xd6Hf.jpg</a><br>
The window into this room right after the chapter load is too high. There is a cool dead security guard in there and I realized that I have been having to jump up to see it every time. The window looks like it was made for people over 6’5’’ and makes gordon feel tiny at this part.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/dhHoU.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/dhHoU.jpg</a><br>
This door from the janitors closet to the gasworks building is on an auto close timer. This makes sense for the large gates and such, but for a regular door like this it seems weird when it suddenly closes out of nowhere. If this is also for optimization maybe you could make it one of those swing type doors where it closes as soon as you walk through it?</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/QrpeK.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/QrpeK.jpg</a><br>
Here is the object clipping issue I mentioned earlier when you walk on the antenna into this part.<br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/MTFbs.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/MTFbs.jpg</a><br>
After taking one step further.</p>
<p>Also I noticed right after you get barney that you completely miss seeing that helicopter crashing on the roof across the courtyard. I didn’t even know this happened at all after all the times I have played that map lol. I think you need to delay that sequence by about 5-10 seconds so the door is actually open and you SEE it happen.</p>

</aside>
<p>The “majority of players” i’m referring to would be the people who contact them outside of forums.  There was a very interesting interview with the music guy on the bms project and he let in on a few things regarding responses to the game after release and how much feedback they got on gameplay balance and ‘overuse’ of crouch jumps.  When you stare at something and perfect it long enough its easy as an artist to lose a clear perspective, and sometimes it requires the voice of fifty thousand emails to let you know what you might have missed.  I’m not saying the BMS community is tiny or insignificant, but the size of the community versus the amount of unique downloads is a STAGGERING ratio.  Enthusiasts will always have a different perspective from the base player.  Someone who’s played half life 2 and the episodes but never touched the original is going to come at this differently than someone who plays half life once a year (me)</p>
<p>Even then I think they kind of overdid it on the crouch jumping.  They made the marines STRONGER than they were in the original game, which ruined my entire “dont stop for nothing” playstyle which USUALLY WORKS PRETTY WELL in half life.  (They have 20% more defense to the arms and legs and 33% more to the head than they did in HL1, i think thats how the ratios mash out)</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah I guess its recreating a moment form the original, but keep in mind that the goal of bms was to make half life 1 more like a modern valve game and fix little problems here and there.  Fighting a series of 4-8 vorts with a turret in a confined hallway is one of those things that I believe would be stripped out for being “kind of boring”.  Also you can just kill a few vorts and run past them and as soon as you open the door they immediately turn around and forget all about you because theres marines in the next room shooting vorts.</p>
<p>Again, I’m not demanding anything or anything like that, I’m just noting my feelings on the encounter as it is.  I like that you can run past them, but when you can see the way their respawn works…maybe theres a better solution for that.  (it feels like theres more than there should be there, though)  With this and the bathroom encounter, its just a situation of “Having more enemies here isnt super necessary because we’ve already got all these bits inbetween with lots of enemies”  Sort of the way valve tends to do things is to dip up and down in terms of making combat stand out.  Alot of shooters just keep throwing large groups of enemies at you for challenge reasons, but I feel like its more challenging to pull back here and there, because it messes with player expectation in a way that makes big moments feel larger.  These are just nitpicks.  This mod is so good that really these things are the only areas I can find any problem with because its been tuned so good up to this point.  They’re just the parts that stand out the most I guess.</p>
<p>I think some of the big battles could use a little tweaking.  I’ve played the mod a few times and while i really like it, theres parts where it feels like theres like 1 more vort and brute than there should be, but since its so dynamic its so hard to predict.</p>
<p>is there any way to try to tilt the balance in one faction’s favor without just adding 5 more brutes to a battle?  :&lt;  (I do really like all the setpieces and it really does emphasize the feeling of “oh shit the aliens are serious now” to the game)</p>

          <p>I forgive everything for Famguy’s addition of the vort spawning behind you.  It’s a perfect wordless way of foreshadowing that the human troops are losing - and <em>why</em>.  (I just wish that there was some point worked in where you could overhear human troops discussing the shit that they’re wading in - longer than the “semper fi my ass, this whole operation is fubar” line, more like a full conversation.  I know that Famguy’s remake isn’t that radical, though.)</p>
<p>EDIT: To create a battle that the military could never win, what if you scripted a battle where they ran out of ammunition really early on, being reduced to meelee only, and could thus only win if you took out the aliens for them?  It might not fit, because I don’t think the soldiers can run out of ammunition currently, but it’s just an idea.</p>

          <p>the dynamic nature of the fights is whats cool about it though.  The only problem is that sometimes the brutes get a few too many lucky shots and then you have to fight way too many aliens to get through.  (Does the tank explosion damage nearby npc entities?)</p>

<p>I’m not really a member of these forums, so i dont know the forum consensus of it.  What I am talking about IS that “other”.  The groups of people tweeting the staff on twitter and hashtagging the game talking about crouch jumps and golem marines and weapon imbalance.  (There was an interview with the music composer for BMS and he was talking about the dearth of replies they got not just on the forum but outside of their own community, he let slip how the team is addressing complaints on the game when they release the Xen version)</p>
<p>you can check it out in 3 parts here:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd9OC1lQHZs" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Part 1</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZhWkxyp1rY" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Part 2</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8DBlLW1b-Q" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Part 3</a>.  He specifically talks about feedback and gives us some insight on the Xen update coming some time next year.  Its a pretty interesting listen.</p>
<p>anyways thats enough derailing.  I’m doing a run of the entire second act of the game as a “pacing study”  (residue processing through lambda core)</p>

          <p>Okay, on the topic that ocular_smashbang brought up about the redundant encounters, I’ll add my $0.02.</p>
<p>The Vort encounter was both in Half-Life and in Black Mesa. It’s staying. I won’t say anything more about its removal, but I will point out that your logic is a tad contradictory. You complain that the fight is “kind of boring” but then you also complain about being able to skip it, if you find the fight “kind of boring” surely being able to skip it is a positive thing? Granted, not having “redundant” fights in the first place would be a superior alternative, but as far as I’ve heard, you’re the first to make any complaint about it whatsoever. So my logic is as follows: if the majority of people like the encounter, but a few don’t, and there’s a way to skip it easily for those who don’t, doesn’t everybody win? If I made it unskippable, as you asked, wouldn’t that just make you unhappier, as you would then be forced to play an encounter you personally find boring?</p>
<p>The Snarks I agree are a slightly more contentious decision, but neither of the 2 encounters I added were placed there simply for the purpose of “filling” empty areas, and I think it’s very unfair for you to assume that, because it carries with it the implication of poor level design. The first added Snark encounter, by the bathroom, I actually didn’t add till very late in the development stage, way way after I had the 2 Zombies there. I was originally going to have it so that the Snarks came pouring out after you went into the second bathroom, but a little error with the I/O had it so they came out immediately upon you getting up there (as it is now). I thought watching the Snarks fight the Zombies was really cool, so I kept it. Snarks were a really underused element in BM, and they’re not that difficult to fight even if you don’t use the Hivehand. I don’t get why people keep calling it a difficult encounter, seeing as you literally don’t even have to fight at all during that one. You don’t have to be a skilled player to recognize that when there’s 2 groups which are hostile to you, fighting it out with one another, you let them kill each other, do your work for you!</p>
<p>The third Snark encounter, the one in the vent leading up to the Garg, is not very good, I agree. I am either going to change or remove it. But again, I didn’t put it there for the purpose of “filling” space, the vent would have been perfectly fine without them. I just like Snarks and think they were underused throughout Black Mesa. It seemed a decent enough place to put them, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>As to your comments about the battle, I also don’t like the implication that my sole means of balancing was “just adding 5 more brutes to the battle.” It really, really, and I mean <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">really</span></span> doesn’t do justice to the lengths I’ve gone to in my attempts to balance the battles. It has never, and I mean <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">never</span></span> been a case of “oh, the marines are winning this battle, let’s add 5 more Alien Grunts!” The difference between the HECU winning and the Aliens winning by a vast amount can literally be decided by having a wave of aliens spawn 1 second earlier/later than they were previously decided to. And I mean that. Having 1 Vort extra in wave 1 can completely unbalance everything. Having the wave of Marines NOT rushing the aliens can completely turn the tide. Moving a Marine from the sandbags over to the truck can literally unbalance the entire fight. The whole balancing act in both the helipad and abrams battles is a culmination of numbers, positioning, timing, tactics, all of which I have to consider for each individual unit. I know it sounds like I’m blowing it out of proportion, but I’ve literally poured hours into JUST moving units around in their timing and spacing and numbers, only to have the whole balance fail, time and time again. I don’t like the implication that I’ve been haphazardly balancing these fights. It’s damn difficult. I’m getting closer to a perfect balance with each new version, where the aliens win by 1 or 2 every time, but I’m not there yet.</p>
<p>It would actually be easier to balance with less units, but I don’t want less units. I like the numbers as they are, it really adds a great sense of scale. I don’t want more though, either. I think numbers wise it’s got a good balance between huge scale and manageability/renderablility. Now it’s just getting those numbers to balance out.</p>
<p>As for the other bits of feedback which have been posted, thanks to the posters. There are, again, things which slipped under the net which you’ve now brought to my attention, and I’m working hard to fix them. I’m aiming for the next beta to be the final one, before release, though I’d estimate there’s only a 60% chance of that actually being the case. I’ve targeted 2 areas for “major overhaul” and I’m hoping that once they’ve received them that will be it for any serious changes to the maps, in terms of geometry. And those areas are the rooftop on C2A5H, and the security office on C2A5H. Granted, the rooftop’s renovations aren’t major, but it’s enough to make the Sniper encounter a little easier (I’ve moved some obstacles and added a little more “solid” cover, to appease those complaining about it being too difficult). The Security Office will hopefully see major overhaul once the inspiration for theme and layout strikes me. Until then, it’s bug hunting and battle balancing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">[COLOR=‘Red’]IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT VOICE ACTING, EVERYONE PLEASE READ THIS!</span></span></p>
<p>As part of the “overhaul” for the security office, I’m also going to overhaul Barney’s choreography and lines. What exactly do I mean by this? I’m going to attempt to contact the voice actor for Barney, and ask him (very politely!) if he could record some lines for me. Just as part of a little fan project, of course, nothing major. Barney’s dialogue in the security office currently makes very little sense in the context of my maps, and I’d like to add some exposition relevant to my 2 little maps. I’ll post here what I’ve written for a “script” that I’d like him to record, and I’ll see what you guys think and work on the criticisms before I send off.</p>

<p>I’ll come with you, but only until I’m sure you can carry on through safely. Then I’ll come back here and lock everything behind you so you can’t be followed.</p>

          <p>I agree about removing the snarks in the vent leading to the garg, change it to a headcrab. The snarks seems overly used especially they’re in 3 consecutive maps. They should stay rare. They were there in that part in the original Black Mesa version of bm_c2a5g because of the cut made by the devs.</p>

          <p>I apologize if i came off as too harsh.  I do greatly enjoy the mod and it was really just the most picky of nitpicks.  (There were actually some bits in BMS that I called bullshit on that ended up actually being in the game after I looked it up.  It’d been so long since i did a complete playthrough of hl1 that I’d forgotten)</p>
<p>The use of words like “Filler” were more about…well…its not quite as bad as I made it sound.  the snark encounter sticks out, and the vort hill feels weird when it gets filled up with LOTS of chunks of alien gunk.  Its more meant to refer to there being “too many” of something in a section.  The vort spawning section doesnt feel like its quite there yet, and the snarks 2 bit has a few issues to it that i think effect some playstyles strongly.</p>
<p>just finished my “full second act” run including the mod.  (everything from after you get thrown in the trash compactor to jumping through the xen portal)  One thing I did find was that the additional areas in this mod, and the second half of the game in general, <span class="bbcode-b">really</span> benefited from tweaking the game values to be accurate to the HL1 values.  (Since you hit the armory just before this, it ends up really balancing out the larger encounters)</p>
<p>I <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> like being able to run past the vorts, i just felt like the way the waves warp in was a little odd feeling, i liked it but i felt like there was something a little off feeling about it.  (Fighting so many vorts in a single area.  Maybe spreading them out or changing the timers?)  It might be interesting if a wave spawns on a much larger delay, to trick players into thinking the encounter is over, only to end up spawning vorts in as they walk down the hill or approach a door.</p>
<p>the big battle, After playing it a few more times, it does seem to be balanced pretty well.  Its alot of fun and even on runs where I wipe out marines before aliens (Since they spawn infront of the player, instinct can point to immediately go for them.)  However, this was with half life 1 style weapon and marines balance cfg (they have much higher head and limb def in bms than in the old game, and clips/ammo counts are much smaller in BMS than they were in the original game)  Running with an MP5 that has 250 rounds, 10 grenades, and a clip of 50 (matched to the original game) really makes you feel like a badass in this bit, i dont get why bms devs made these balance changes.  (I’ve heard they’re going to add some sort of toggle in the Xen release)  In some ways problems with this fight are more a problem with Black Mesa Source’s balance than your encounters, since original half life 1 stats actually give you enough armament to tackle a full army of either side.  One other thing, my pc is a powerhouse and i still get bad frameskip during the massive scenes sometimes.  Briefly, but it does happen sometimes.</p>
<p>I didnt realize the snarks fought the head crab zombies.  I instinctively shoot the zombie, and have a ton of snarks to fumble past.  What makes the encounter difficult is that its in a small area with an open window behind you that you can fall out of if you’re clumsy.  (I find that snarks dont jump off ledges as much as headcrabs)  I feel like adding a health pack in the first bathroom would balance out the damage players would recieve in this situation.  (killing the zombie and not using the bee-gun or elaborate weapons.)  any situation that isnt good for the mp5 and shotgun is going to prove difficult for many players, which is probably why its gotten so much feedback in the difficulty department.  I’m not sure what a good solution to the encounter would be without removing snarks.</p>
<p>The marines in the room with the brute after it throws one through the wall dont have any ammo on them.  it might be nice to throw some items in that tiny room, maybe some clips and a single mp5 grenade?  I might have forgotten but i think the vent platforming room towards the end doesnt have any marine gear near their corpses either.</p>
<p>buttons for doors dont show up for me in the map, but the lights do.  this wasnt effecting any map in the regular game, just in the new maps.  (All i got was a blue/green glow infront of the door coming out of concrete)  This has happened for me with certain objects in questionable ethics, but not reliably.  However, these buttons have been missing in all of my runs of these maps.  It also seems to take much longer than usual to load these maps, but that could just be the source engine being finicky.</p>
<p>I think the map feels much better played as part of the game, rather than playing just the map itself, because its such an intense section of the game.  It really amps up the feel of the big surface section in Forget About Freeman when you see marines evacuating Black Mesa as they get taken out by mantas all over.  The HL1 Marines and Weapons stats helped abit too (BMS made some poor balance choices)  I hope you keep it up to date for updates to BMS (xen update.  They’ve said they might change some things) so nothing bugs out with it.</p>
<p>I dont really have any feedback on the dialogue suggestion.  I think the current dialogue is alright, and i enjoy the “beer” line.  I would say “Holy Mother of God” is more in line with what a barney would say in that scene than “Jesus Fucking Christ”.  Honestly I’m fine with the dialogue as it is and dont feel like it creates any major issues.  chickenprotector, your rewrite feels a little crass and has “action movie swearing” which is a big no-no.  You also want to watch out for repetition between sentences (using a word, such as “plan” too soon after using it again)</p>

<p>I too apologize if I was being a tad aggressive - I’m just very defensive of my work as I’ve put a LOT into it (FAR TOO MUCH! REAL LIFE HATES ME!).</p>
<p>I won’t say anymore about the balancing issues, though your proposal of staggering the vorts out a little bit actually seems like a decent idea.</p>
<p>As for the blue keypad bug, this wasn’t something I knew about till recently, and I was sceptical of it at first. Then I did a playthrough from Questionable Ethics - Lambda Core and got it myself, so I took a look at the cause. It was caused by using a global entity name from (I THINK?) Questionable Ethics, meaning any playthrough reaching my maps that involved Questionable Ethics meant the keypad would disappear. I have resolved it and do not get that bug anymore, so it’s fixed for 0.83.</p>
<p>My maps taking a bit longer to load is a product of that fact that they are SO FULL, I reckon. No more no less. The only way to fix it would be to split the 3 maps into 4, which would be even more of a pain in the ass, so I figure it’s fine as it is.</p>
<p>As for the framerate drop, I have a mid-high tier rig myself and never get any drops below 30, period, during my maps. If your rig is tougher than mine you definitely shouldn’t be having any of that, as I’ve max settings’d everything. I’ve got i5 3.3GHz, 8GB RAM, HD 6900. As far as I know there are 3 low framerate areas on my map, but 3 demanding areas over 3 maps is kinda consistent with Black Mesa anyway, which is already rickety in the framerate department. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helipad Fight</li>
<li>Abrams Fight</li>
<li>Garg Courtyard</li>
</ul>
<p>None of which are areas I can do anything about. The Garg Courtyard had poor frames in Black Mesa’s default version too.</p>

<p>Yeah I’ll try and cut it down a bit and add a few more colloquialisms. I think your script went a bit far but I’ll try and take some aspects from it.</p>

<p>Though I like what you did, I don’t like to use the word “fuck”. Why? Not because I have a problem with the word “fuck,” but it’s not something that gets said at all during Black Mesa (at least by my recollection). Barneys in BM like to say “shit” a lot, but I can’t remember one ever saying “fuck”. So I’d imagine that having him say “fuck” in my lines would kinda jar with the rest of the game.</p>
<p>As for the real time cameras, I already know how to do that, and have already done it. It’s a very easy entity setup. I’ll have to use static shots for the cameras showing C2A5G though, because I have 2 options for this scene:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copy parts of C2A5G onto C2A5H and have them hidden out of sight, only seen by the real-time cameras. Incurs a large rendering cost, fills the map even further, increases loading time, for very little benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just use simple static shots. Hardly any rendering cost, for a very small cut in realism.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I played the last version of your maps and there is still one problem:<br>
HL2 cars like this:<br>
It is Zaporozhets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporozhets" data-bbcode="true">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporozhets</a>, Soviet car. Please, delete or replace it with some bms model. HL2 cars really trashing black mesa atmosphere, thats why Black Mesa team did not use them in their maps.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Eh, doesn’t bother me that much. Black Mesa has literally 1 car model. Having the same car model copy pasted all around my maps would be just as bad, if not worse. I’ll see what I can do.</p>
