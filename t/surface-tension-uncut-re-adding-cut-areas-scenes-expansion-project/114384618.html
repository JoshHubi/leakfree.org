          <p>When the tank comes in, in c2a5h the marines are no longer behind it… This was so much better when it was like this…</p>
<p>The jump pad definately around the corner in c2a5h to get into the warehouse needs a level platform to land on… An emergency stairwell on the outside of the building zig zagging upwards would be the best solution perhaps or some flat platform you can reach to make a jump to the pipe… perhaps even another aircon unit?</p>
<p>When coming out the first toilet the fake door to the left can be used for a stairwell access to the roof as the jump pad is awful in the other toilet room but keep it as a deathtrap or lucky ascent onto the roof.</p>
<p>Sniper has to go I think unless you can make him killable or easily killable… Make the access on the roof to break a grate like in the original it will be better.</p>
<p>Put a small pipe running horizonally for a ledge so you can gain access into the satchel pipe to the furnace room. Use particle effect bubbles not env_bubbles in the water</p>
<p>Going back to the first level c2a5h the osprey that gets blown up needs to go on the right and it’s debris not cause damage… Have a horizontal walkway leading from a door to the helipad that 3 marines sprint along… The player can get access via a ladder to the walkway that the marines run along but the door is locked after the marines come out and it closes. This will stop all the debris getting in the way.</p>

          <p>There has been an awful lot posted in this thread since I posted my maps, which is good, people are paying attention.</p>
<p>I don’t have time to address feedback now because I’m with a friend and I won’t be free to do so tomorrow, when I’ll also make a video explaining certain things.</p>
<p>A lot of the criticisms levied at me are flat out unfair, however, but we’ll go into that tomorrow. There’s a lot of valid stuff there too, of course.</p>
<p>Some people have been reporting a lot of weird bugs which I certainly wasn’t experiencing - this makes it very hard to know what you’re talking about. During my 3 test playthroughs I didn’t experience ANY major gamebreaking bugs whatsoever. Nothing. Completely bug free. So when you guys report things not working vaguely it’s not terribly helpful, while I apologize for you guys getting these bugs I’d appreciate a little bit more clarity so I can squash them for the next version and you won’t have to deal with them again. It’s a shame, I feel it’s giving people a bad impression of my maps which I certainly wasn’t anticipating - because I hadn’t seen any of these bugs.</p>
<p>A new version is on the horizon tomorrow when I can take a proper look at what’s up.</p>

<p>I know that but on easy and normal none of them die which leads to the palyer being easily killed by the large group of aliens.</p>

<p>Maybe don’t always play on hard</p>
<p>At least try it on easy first</p>
<p>You don’t always have to do it on hard</p>
<p>But your combined fire with the HECU’s should be enough to kill them</p>
<p>And no, don’t kill the marines until the aliens kill them, or the aliens are dead</p>

          <p>Firstly I want to say that this is a superbly executed project and to thank you for all the effort you have put in to it. In particular I found your Garg entrance inspired! Anyhoo on to the constructive criticism:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">c2a5g_uncut</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The fight that occurs outside the multi-leveled car park finishes too quickly, I found that if you don’t immediately go over to the hole in the wall and look down the aliens have already won. Perhaps the fight could be triggered as one approaches the hole.</li>
<li>In the garage, when one presses the button to raise and lower the car lift closest to the window, the attached ramps go through the floor rather than sliding along them</li>
<li>When one looks through the window on the car lift there is a soldier directly across from you on a balcony. He is very hard to hit with a crossbow (my first weapon of choice due to distance) as the holes in the railings block arrow bolts</li>
<li>When the osprey explodes the pieces left behind cause damage which is unexpected and annoying, this becomes extremely problematic when a piece blocks the exit and you cannot leave without jumping down and getting hurt by the metal. This killed me in my first run as I tried to push the metal out of the way.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">c2a5h</span></p>
<ul>
<li>When the wall gets blown open revealing a view of the aliens and marines fighting in the courtyard below, the smoke from the explosion hangs around way too long and completely obscured the view. It took <span class="bbcode-u">ages</span> for it to disperse and really detracted from the drama below.</li>
<li>The maintenance access sign on the roof looks very out of place simply on a pole and is i think necessary, if you do keep it though you need to close the gap between the sign and the pole as right now it is floating in front of the pole.</li>
<li>Others have mentioned how the ladder in the water when you drop down in to the pipe trap gets in the way and this true, however another problem is that it is of a completely different type to the ladder it presumably broke off from above. The part still attached is much thinner than the chunky one in the water. Also the ladder part that is still attached above is awkwardly placed and clips through the hatchway wall in a odd fashion.</li>
<li>The sign on a stick in the furnace room looks extremely out of place on the walkway there. I know you are trying to ensure that players are aware they need to switch off the gas but I think it is unnecessary. For one thing the same sign is already on the pipe at eye height when you first enter the room and due to the fire you have to pause and thus are likely to read the sign. Also the prominence of the valves and the missing one make it obvious what has to be done, especially as the idea of turning a valve to stop a fire has already been established to the player earlier in the game. As such the gameplay does not justify the really out of place sign on a pole.</li>
<li>The first jump from the gray pipe to the brown one to avoid the steam leaks to get to the security guard room is just too hard. I actually don’t mind jumping puzzles (I liked Xen!) but that jump killed me twice and I ended up just throwing myself through the steam in frustration. I never completed the jump but it seemed to require an accurately guided long distance crouch-jump which is too much. Maybe move the brown pipe closer?</li>
<li>The snarks that jump out at you from the vent just before the Grag chase are too much, as there is no where to back off too and a lot of them. Maybe a head crab attack instead?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">General Points</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In your read me file you have left out the ‘bm_’ prefix in your instructions on how to load the maps</li>
<li>There needs to be more health/armour drops throughout the maps, as it is desperate all the way through which is very distracting and prevents one appreciating the interesting things going on</li>
<li>There is a fair bit of pipes clipping through railings throughout the maps, this is not a major point and there are too many examples to list, but it is a bit jarring when compared to the incredible attention to detail you have put in to the rest of the details in the map.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I say I think this is a tremendous achievement, so please take these notes in the constructive spirit they were meant and I look forward to seeing more excellent stuff from you.</p>

<p>yes I know they are to win thing is they win to easily on easy and normal. on easy and normal almost none die leaving you with most of them firing at you this will lead to death for most players. you either help the soldiers then kill them or die do to the full alien attack group.</p>

          <p>My feedback from a first time play through of the maps. I played it once just enjoying it and making mental notes and then played a second time to do more testing and double check some things plus take screenshots. I really enjoyed these maps and these are mostly simple things that maybe you didn’t notice as the creator and having played through them so many times.</p>
<p>The issues I bring up are in order from the start of the first map going onward.</p>

After defeating the vortigaunts with the 50 cal. you come to this garage door which you have to open. The door closes after a short time. I feel like after you go into the garage the door shouldn’t be closing behind you unless there is a way to open it back up again or simply don’t have it on a timer to close at all. It’s fairly obvious that this is where you came from so I don’t think it is too confusing and it gives the player the chance to backtrack and find that extra room with the single vortigaunt in it if they want. This should be a general rule for half-life maps. Don’t block the backtracking unless it is for an obvious reason like after a fall or a map load.</p>

Inside the garage on the first level you can see the suit health battery pack. The door has no handle and does not open. Once you make your way down to it from the second or third floor the door still cannot be opened. Make it so the door opens from the inside and possible give the door handles on each side, but be locked from the outside. It’s a small issue, but this is something half-life games usually do and would be an easy fix.</p>

After you go outside and are on this vent thing it is a little confusing what you are supposed to jump down onto. Everyone I have watched play this part stands there for a few seconds looking around like uhm…where do I jump. The camera could be a little bit higher or closer or simply add a tall box on the other side that you can also fall down onto.</p>

Once you are down in that area there is his large gate with a green keypad. The pad makes no noise and has no reaction when you press it. This isn’t the way you’re supposed to go so making it make an error (locked) noise or simply be red instead of green would make sense.</p>

As others have pointed out this ladder is a bit of a pain. It can take a good fifteen seconds to get into the vent and just comes off as frustrating. Surely if you know the perfect keyboard combination you can get in every time easily, but the point is first time players don’t know it and it’s not like a ladder is supposed to be a puzzle.</p>

Inside the car mechanic garage the car lift that you need to get onto to jump out the broken window has these metal planks that go into the ground. It just looks funny especially when you press the button after it has already gone up once and see them slide through the floor. When you do initially raise it they go into a perfect ramp position that you could walk up onto, but you can’t. Possible make it so you can walk up them and not be able to lower it once it’s raised.</p>

This is just a no no. These boxes make you think 'I want to get those", but you can’t get in there any way despite there being an obvious gate door. Just get rid of those boxes if you can’t get in there.</p>

This is the garage door that you have to blow open with the tow? launcher. There is really no indication that this is what you’re supposed to do though. Sure after 20-30 seconds you figure it out, but I feel like it could use a visual cue as well. Making cracks on the door giving it the impression that it’s about to break anyways would help.</p>
<p>On another note about this fight there seems to be maybe one more alien than needed. It’s okay to have a tough fight, but after this scene there is yet another battle for you with no health inbetween. Right after this garage is a flatbed truck with nothing inside it before the next battle. Put health or suit health inside it.</p>

In the next area there is a table with a map on it. If you jump onto the table the map does a disappearing act. If I moved a little more forward in this picture the map would completely blend into the table.</p>

The osprey parts damage you when you touch them. I get the feeling that you added this because they would be hot and it isn’t a lot of damage, but I find this is just more annoying than cool. Sometimes the parts get in the way of where you need to go (see pic) and it’s just weird to lose health to them and comes off as glitchy rather than thoughtful.</p>

After you go to the next area you see the zombie banging on the glass in that little room. Take the corner and there is this health charger and the vortigaunt. Make the door into where the zombie was accessible and move the health charger into that room with him. It’s just weird to see an enemy like that and then not have any way to get to him also the charger would fit in better there.</p>

Once you fall down to the area with the pipe the soldier throws the satchel into you can move this ladder around by touching it and then it becomes very difficult to climb into said pipe. Make the ladder immobile or on the floor under the water. Being able to move this ladder around from it’s original position seems to be the problem.</p>

In this room the first two valves work well. The valve that you have to pick up and insert into this socket is a pain though. It simply doesn’t always turn. Pressing E once doesn’t work. Holding E doesn’t work. It took me a good 30 seconds to get this valve to turn properly.</p>
<p>Also it seems silly that they would paint or put a sticker on upside down so close to the ground on this pipe saying high pressure steam. If this were a horizon-tile pipe yeah it would make sense to have the sign facing each direction, but upside down is just odd. Simply remove the bottom notice.</p>

This is the garage door that you go out after barney disables the security. This door shouldn’t close when you go outside. There is no reason for it to close and can cause you to accidentally get separated from barney. Again, if there is no reason to then don’t hinder the players ability to backtrack.</p>

After the giant alien garg? chases you outside and you kill it you can’t go back the way you came and explore. There’s literally just an invisible wall stopping you from going back inside which seems very strange. Please just let us backtrack unless this is being done for performance in some way.</p>

After you drop the mortars on the antenna and turn the valve to get into this area all hell should break loose outside. If you play this exact part in the original half-life as soon as you go in this area you hear tons of bombing going on outside. I think it would be very appropriate to have rubble collapse and block the way back out at this part and as you go down the road a little add in a few environment vibrations. The entire outside area is getting bombed at this point so let us know. Also this little area just seems very plain and odd with nothing happening.</p>
<p>Final thoughts. I also had the three missing textures that others pointed out. The snipers position is a bit awkward and frustrating. On a normal play-through of the entire mod without cheats you probably wouldn’t want to waste your rockets on him. Performance: I did have minor slowdowns, but overall the maps ran pretty much just as well as the rest of the mod for me.</p>

In this room the first two valves work well. The valve that you have to pick up and insert into this socket is a pain though. It simply doesn’t always turn. Pressing E once doesn’t work. Holding E doesn’t work. It took me a good 30 seconds to get this valve to turn properly.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You have to aim perfectly at the center of the valve otherwise won’t work.<br>
it’s a small glitch but can bother the player…</p>

          <p>Just played through, awesome work man! Needs a little more polish but overall it’s a great addition to the chapter. I won’t go into too much detail because you’ve been overwhelmed by feedback, but I’d like to point out a few graphical bugs I don’t think anyone has noticed yet:</p>
<p>On the jump-pad in the bathroom, if you look at the skybox buildings while you’re in mid air you can see where it cuts off. You might have to lower the buildings or extend them so you can’t see that gap:</p>

<p>Just another minor thing, but I still think it would be cool to see some of these towers on the refinery building somewhere:</p>

<p>I also agree there needs to be more medkits throughout the maps, I was running on low health quite a lot. Some of those larger battles are brutal!</p>

          <p>Here is my comprehensive list of bugs/suggestions/improvements.  Unfortunately, it will get buried in this thread due to feedback from multiple testers.  If you need a copy as a checklist, you can PM me your email and I’ll send you the Word document.  [COLOR=‘Red’]Red=critical stuff,[COLOR=‘Yellow’] Yellow=important stuff, [COLOR=‘Lime’]Green=health/ammo placement</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">General impressions</span><br>
After a complete playthrough of ST w/your sections, I can say that the quality of your work is on par w/BMS as a whole.  While your sections stand out for their quality and contribution to storytelling, they do not stand out negatively in any way.  There are no issues w/pacing or excessive loading screens when compared to the rest of ST and the music track for the tank battle in C2A5H is all you need.</p>
<p>It goes w/o saying that you’ve done great work here so I’m just going to provide you with my list of suggestions and keep things as streamlined as possible.  Some of these are major issues and some are not, but everything is organized by order of playthrough for easy tracking.  Past suggestions that I’ve made for you will be kept concise.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">General</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]Is it possible to make C2A5G and C2A5H “less shitty” (quoting you) in the map editor w/o significantly revising it? When you brought this up, it raised a red flag in my head w/regards to integration w/BMS.   While the quality of your work as observed by the player is as good if not better than the devs, the mapping apparently is not.  Since all of the maps in BMS are very well constructed, yours would potentially stand out as the weakest link as it’s not up to their professional standards.  If your maps were brought up to par, the chance of getting them officially integrated into the mod would be higher.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]Ammo and health placement: I’m going to keep the explanations minimal and just make the suggestions below.  I think my placements are very logical but if you don’t want to use them, use these two simple rules instead: 1) No batteries near HECU gear…place them elsewhere.  Marines only use health packs (at least until OpFor). 2) Explosives and energy weapon ammo should be reserved till AFTER the tank battle in C2A5H to minimize script breaking but the current placement of tripmines and grenades are acceptable.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">C2A5G</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">.50 cal vort shootout</span><br>
Add xenofauna by the silo door (just the moss).</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]Add 2 medpacks by the dead marines in the .50 cal vort shootout (they are there in full ST playthrough but apparently absent when using console).</p>
<p>Get rid of the vort that spawns behind the player after the shootout.  Players will have 0 battery by this time and have already take enough damage from the vorts because they don’t miss.  The last thing they need is a cheap shot before going into the garage.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]There are 2 crates in the room leading up to the old garg chase.  Add a battery inside each crate.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Garage</span><br>
In general, needs a few more signs to enhance its detail.  Put “Exit” signs over the spiral driveways.  Add things like “Stairwell,” “Lot A,” “Floor 1-3” etc.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]The color of the pavement in the spiral driveway is noticeably different from the pavement in the garage.  Ideally, they should match.</p>
<p>Don’t park the hummer in the handicap zone of the 1st floor.</p>
<p>Crack open the ceiling a bit above the 1st jump pad.  It makes the destruction pattern on the second floor make more sense and prevents the player from feeling like their head will be crushed when using the pad.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]From the second floor, you can see the building housing the vent scene.  You MUST add INDESTRUCTIBLE windows to the top of the building as there is currently nothing there.  As it stands now, you can kill every single marine inside w/ the hornet gun and grenades.  If you do this and you get to the vent drop sequence, the “marines” shoot holes in the vent and when you drop down, there’s nothing there, which looks really stupid.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can kill all of the marines outside the garage by shooting hornets from the second floor which will leave you w/a shitload of aliens to deal with later.  To prevent these problems, have a script triggering the marines to come out of the silo door (vent side) once the player gets to the 3rd floor or approaches the exit/AC units.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Marines vs aliens</span><br>
Add some blue crates below the AC unit (near the debris) such that the player doesn’t have to take fall damage.  Alternatively you can move the blue crates near the snark vent to this location.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]Add a medkit near or on top of a blue crate.</p>
<p>The silo door on the alien side (opposite the vent) is “leaky.”  By standing at either corner, you can see a sliver of the background landscape at the edge of the door.</p>
<p>The silo door on the alien side has a keypad w/a blue screen.  If BMS has a pad w/a red screen, use this instead to indicate that the player can’t go here.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Vent drop/car shop</span><br>
[COLOR=‘red’]The vent layout here is exactly the same as the layout during the garg scene.  I suggest you change it in this location and make it less convoluted.</p>
<p>There is one white light inside the vent that is trapped in a sea of red lights.  This should be changed to red to maintain consistency w/all vents in BMS.</p>
<p>If possible, make it so that player can see through the bullet holes but keep the lighting effects.</p>
<p>The piece of the vent that the player stands on is perfectly square after the rest of the pieces fall off.  It might look more realistic if it had a more jagged appearance.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]This scene is meant to showcase the effectiveness of snarks but unfortunately they don’t do shit because the marines are aimbots.  I suggest you delete 1 marine.  Of the 3 remaining marines, make one visible when the player is in the vent.  Place the other 2 marines close to the vent such that the snarks don’t have to close in as much to get into melee range.</p>
<p>The car shop could benefit from some HDR effects.  Perhaps have some rays of light come from the rooftop windows.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]Health dispenser should dispense 75 health if it doesn’t already.  Consider adding a battery charger as well to address the TOW courtyard (see below).</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘yellow’]Add broken window fragments to the exit window after the bomb detonates.  It might also be nice to have the rooftop windows shatter after detonation as well.</p>
<p>The lift that you use to get window access has two extensions that seemingly disappear into the ground.  You should make depressed areas on the ground to accommodate these extensions or delete them entirely.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">TOW courtyard</span><br>
[COLOR=‘yellow’]There are still some problems here with the layout which will require revision.  Again, the best design is to have a single road with a T-JUNCTION extending from said road as opposed to two roads juxtaposed from the start.  This is consistent with the road design in the rest of ST and will probably look better too.  If you keep your current layout, delete the parking bumper where the old lamppost used to be and replace them w/a pair of highway bumpers (you used 3 of them in the garg scene).  They might look better.</p>
<p>The A/C unit is illogically placed as it’s “protecting” the main entrance.  Perhaps change it to something else or move it closer toward the petrol station to free up space.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]Add a second medkit by the TOW.</p>
<p>While the grunt battle is hard, it’s not imbalanced.  You can take them out reasonably well w/RPGs and satchel or w/tau if you use cover and have high health.   It’s really the TOW launcher that’s shit because of the slow manual reload.  I suggest that you don’t cut down on the number of grunts…it’s pretty impressive to see 4 of them fanning out in formation and you don’t get this effect w/3.  Here’s some possible solutions: 1) put some of the TOW missiles closer to the launcher 2) add some cover on the left side of the sandbags…[COLOR=‘lime’]a couple of destructible crates w/one of them containing a medpack would work 3) add a battery charger in the carshop.</p>
<p>Consider adding a few alien grunt noises when players approach the silo opposite the TOW launcher.  This will hopefully encourage them to use the trip mines.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]From the TOW courtyard to the end of C2A5G, there are plants coming out of some parts of the pavement.  You have to look carefully but make sure to delete these.  This problem is not found in C2A5H or C2A5I, just this map.</p>
<p>Delete the cactus in the little garden.  It looks unnatural near the tree and the other plants.</p>
<p>Delete the metal railings on top of the hangar entrances.  Functionally, they serve no purpose and are inconsistent w/the design in the rest of ST.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘yellow’]Harrier takeoff needs some optimization.  The plane needs to be horizontal until it nears the end of the take off.  Add some jet sound effects and an exhaust trail and it should be perfect.</p>
<p>Background textures are too orange and stand out.  They need to be more detailed.</p>
<p>Consider darkening up the air traffic control tower a little.  It’s connected to the bunker emplacement so it should be made of the same materials.  Plus deserts are windy and the dust will grime things up.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Road leading to Osprey</span><br>
The third cactus you encounter is adjacent to a lamppost which is unrealistic.  Move it a little further away.  There is also a rock near this cactus w/a plant coming out.  The plant should be deleted, as plants don’t grow on rocks.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘yellow’]The M35 in the road is empty.  Add some green boxes inside it as well as some undeployed sentry turrets.  Make one of the turrets pick-up-able so that the astute player can use it against the aliens in the LAV courtyard (the player could really use an advantage here).</p>
<p>Delete the rock textures in the middle of the road.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Osprey/LAV courtyard</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]This is the only section in C2A5G where I experienced a framerate drop.</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other posters, I’m really glad that you made this battle blatantly favor the aliens.  By making it so obvious, it forces the player to intervene and become a participant rather than an observer.  Keep it this way.  Note that the player can choose to tip the balance to the HECU’s favor simply by killing the alien grunts.</p>
<p>The white desk underneath the army tent looks really out of place.  Either delete it and put the map on one of the green crates or add some chairs.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]The harrier and first manta need to be higher during the script.  It looks like the manta’s wings almost hit the far wall as it continues to pursue.  The first manta also needs a speed boost to more closely match the harrier.</p>
<p>Impressive work w/the helipad…I’m really glad you added the marines flying off the pad and the cracked pavement effect from the manta.  Make sure to delete the highest green crate on the pad as it’s obstructing the player’s view of the defending marines as well as the Osprey (the elevation makes it difficult to see as it is).</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Destroyed Osprey debris causes damage to the player.  This needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]Merge the main road w/the pavement around the hangar.  As it stands, this area is a little too grid-like and the dirt gaps between the pavement sections are unrealistic (all of the gaps should be removed). Completely cover the section underneath the hanger with pavement, as it looks a little sloppy currently (w/plants coming out too).  Alternatively, you can get rid of the non-road pavement surrounding the hangar altogether and it should look fine.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]Add a battery or a medkit inside one of the destructible crates below the helipad.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">C2A5H</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Opening section</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Yellow’]Have the vortigaunt face the health charger and use the heal player effect in HL2 to create the sense that it’s using the charger.  [COLOR=‘lime’]Decrease the amount of health dispensed by the charger to 30-45.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘lime’]You can compensate for the health dispenser by making the door of the dead Barney room accessible and adding a medkit in there or alternatively, place a medkit in the alien grunt room.</p>
<p>The alien grunt that flings the marine has some texture issues when it uses its melee attacks on the player (hornet arm clips through unbroken wall).</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘yellow’]The explosion that opens the player up to the tank battle seems to have no cause.  Add a dead alien grunt near the street debris to show why the section was targeted for destruction.  You can add a harrier sound effect and missile effect just before the explosion to suggest that it caused it or you can position the tank within line of sight of the player (as opposed to driving out) to suggest that it was responsible for the damage.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Tank battle</span><br>
The road that the tank emerges from has a silo door and the player can walk up the sides of this door.  This should be prevented, as players cannot do this on the same doors in the TOW courtyard.  Also, delete the metal railing on the top of the silo.</p>
<p>The swath of destruction cut by the manta beam looks a little unusual.  It appearance will be improved if you make the swath narrower and blacken the area inside and surrounding the swath to create a charred effect.  You can also do this on the helipad in C2A5G.</p>
<p>The building containing the Xenian bathroom could do w/a few more battle scars externally.  Just make sure not to put the blast marks over the windows (as they would realistically shatter).</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘yellow’]The outside door of the hut leading to C2A5I should be locked like the inside.  This makes the most sense as why would one door be locked and not the other?  [COLOR=‘Lime’]Since the grenades inside are useful, simply place them by the .50 cal instead.</p>
<p>Put the dead Barney inside the hut on the floor rather than on the desk…he looks like a gravitationally unfeasible mannequin currently.  A model w/a bulletproof vest might be more realistic.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘yellow’]Currently the .50 cal is useless as there is no third alien wave that spawns when the player reaches it.  You also can’t add this feature now because of the 2 marines on the high ground shooting at you (it’s too distracting).  Instead of deleting the .50 cal, I recommend that you have an alien wave spawn when the player gets near the gun AFTER he rescues the Barney.  This is a nice variation on a theme, as the player is trained to know that turrets equals instant spawns based on previously sections of the game.  However, the late appearance of the spawns here would serve as a nice surprise.</p>
<p>If possible, move the jump pad ever so slightly more to the blue pipe.  It’s surprisingly hard to get on that pipe and rather easy to take fall damage.  For some reason, the pipe also occasionally pushes the player back, which can be disastrous.  Fix this if you can.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Bathroom and rooftop</span><br>
The snarks in the Xenian bathroom can be a little annoying but keep them if you like.  Note that not all snark pickups have to spawn aggressive units (as evidenced by one of the hidden pickups in FaF).</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]On the rooftop, add a dead marine with an RPG launcher and 2 missiles as a way to address the sniper.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]The maintenance access hatch sign needs to be changed as it looks like something you stick in the mud rather than on a building.  Remove the sign and add the words “Maintenance Access” on the hatch itself.<br>
The broken ladder after the fall can make it difficult for players to get out of the water.  When I suggested this mechanic, I wanted you to use the handlebar ladder that you see once in Office Complex and more frequently in Blast Pit, as this looks really old and fits w/the feel of this area.  Also, consider having the ladder be broken PREVIOUSLY and not because you fell.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Satpipe and furnace</span><br>
[COLOR=‘yellow’]Have the satchel detonate about 0.5-1 sec later.  Currently, the marine door is not closed fully before it detonates and it’s kind of hard to get out of the tunnel and survive the blast.</p>
<p>The tunnel to the left of the pipe has an odd, crescent contour when viewed from the side and when approaching it.  It should be more circular.</p>
<p>After seeing the furnace firsthand, I still think the walkway is funny because the furnace is EMBEDDED in it.  Consider fixing it as previously discussed.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]If possible, make it so the red valve CANNOT be placed inside any section of the furnace.  If the player drops it in too deep, they’re screwed.</p>
<p>When placing an explosive barrel in the furnace, the detonation should hurt the player.</p>
<p>On the two “Danger” signs in the furnace room, the word “maintenance” is misspelled.</p>
<p>The way the blue pipe looks now, it seems like it’s extending into the roof as well as connecting to the horizontal section of the pipe on the upper floor.  If possible, get rid of the “extending into the roof” appearance.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]Delete the upside-down “high pressure steam” sign and change “high pressure steam” to something else as it doesn’t make sense to feed steam directly into a fire.  Perhaps “gas line” would work better.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘yellow’]For the furnace puzzle proper, I recommend the following: redesign the pipes such that the horizontal section of the blue pipe is swapped w/the yellow pipe.  Then put the valve holder on the TOP floor and the valve on the BOTTOM floor.  This makes sense as the valve fell due to gravity and gameplay wise would make players hunt for it…currently this “puzzle” seems a little too obvious as the valve is right next to the blue pipe.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]The destroyed section of the pipe that the player exits from to get to the gasworks currently has a black/purple grid over it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Gasworks to end</span><br>
[COLOR=‘red’]This is the only place in C2A5H where I experienced a framerate drop.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]Add a pair of MP5 grenades to the stack of dead HECU.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]The areas above the blue doors on both levels have the black/purple texture.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]The black pipe that you first need to jump onto in order to do the steam puzzle MUST be expanded such that the player can walk onto it.  I literally fell 10 times and died from fall damage because it is TOO NARROW.  Widening it will also fix the unrealistic-looking (clipped) segment that’s incorporated into the wall.</p>
<p>The locked blue door on the second floor should be unlockable from the inside once players get in.  This is consistent w/the rest of BMS.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]The tripmine layout is a little lame currently, as players can hug the opposite side and detonate the first 2 mines w/o taking any damage.  For the first mine, place it so that the beam hits the desk.  Reposition the second mine and add a third mine between the first two, having it face opposite these mines.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Killing Barney before he unlocks the door MUST trigger a failure notice, e.g. “Assignment terminated.  Subject demonstrated extremely poor judgment.”  Use the exact same notice that happens when you kill the armory Barney (just prior to your sections) before he lets you in.</p>
<p>Barney has some clipping issues during his speech and when pushing the control pad.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]Add a crate of uranium in the Barney room.</p>
<p>Once Barney opens the doors, keep the white silo door OPEN.  If you don’t do this, Barney will get stuck and there’s no way to retrieve him.  He’s quite helpful.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]While the script of the Apache crashing into the building looks nice, having two downed Apaches so near each other (one on the roof of the gasworks) strains credibility and creates what I call “chopper eye strain.”  If you want to keep this script, perhaps have the gasworks Apache crash into the building once the player kills the aliens and have the debris fall from the roof.  Otherwise, a much better idea would be to see 3 Ospreys in the distance flying away (toward the player’s left) once Barney opens the silo door.  This greatly reinforces the FUBAR/evacuation concept introduced in C2A5I and FaF.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]Add an alien spawn as players approach the .50 cal (see above).  [COLOR=‘Lime’]If you implement this, add a medkit by the dead Barney in the hut.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">C2A5I</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Garg chase</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Lime’]Move the 2 batteries from the black suspended beam to the side of the walkway opposite the pipe (a more realistic placement).</p>
<p>Remove the walkway handrail overlying the pipe to get rid of the clipping issue.</p>
<p>Fix the clipping issue at the intersection of the beam and the pipe.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]Move the snark attack further back into the pipes.  Currently, the player has no way to prepare for it, as the placement is too close to the entrance.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]During the garg intro, ideally it would be possible to run into the tunnel he came from.  An invisible wall strains belief.  You could have the tunnel terminate w/a silo door, thus ensuring the players death.  The garg’s entrance site could be evidenced by a large hole in the wall that’s inaccessible to the player because of debris.</p>
<p>The garg has clipping issues when he’s trying to pry open the silo door.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]The new movement nodes that you’ve implemented are very impressive if you don’t get on the airstrike tower but there are two problems: 1) Sometimes if you stand on the pool walkway near the valves, the garg will run back to the artillery tower and just stand there. 2) Once you get on the airstrike tower, the garg becomes stupid again.  If you get off the tower, he will no longer chase you or respond when you attack him.  He will still shake the tower though.</p>
<p>You can see the ground through the two pipes closes to the strike tower ladder.  This needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>There is plant growing on a rock near the fence.  Delete it.</p>
<p>The connection between the pool area and the reservoir should ideally have metal doors, as the whole point of these two areas is to prevent water from flowing into each other if need be.</p>
<p>Improve the effect when an artillery shell hits the water.  Currently the single artillery shell generates multiple small splashes in the water or none at all.  The impact should look like a diver hitting the water, but greater in magnitude.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]As mentioned previously, the wall guarding the entrance to FaF should be destructible.  If an artillery shell hits the metal gate, make sure it is destroyed such that the garg can access the entrance.</p>
<p>I do think the ability of the garg to run into the tunnel leading to FaF should be fixed.  Unfortunately, it will have to be dealt with later, as the garg idles once you get on the tower.</p>
<p>At the very end of the tunnel to FaF, there is a distinctly disjointed appearance of the central white line in the road between the segment before the white stripes and the segment after.  This looks incredibly stupid and can easily be fixed by extending the whites stripes to the garage.</p>

You certainly are right about this tower. It’s cool and atmospheric, but it’s not logical. Such structures are used for gas flaring in the oil/gas and chemical industry, for example, (i am constantly confronted with similar structures in my work) and in the Black Mesa as a gas works, rather, is used as a boiler to heat the whole scientific complex and maintain a constant temperature.</p>
