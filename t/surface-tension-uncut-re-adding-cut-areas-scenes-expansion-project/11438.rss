    <description>[u]Final Final for real Update: 26/06/13[/u]
The very final version of Surface Tension Uncut - v2.0 has now been released and is completed. Revisiting these maps has been a joy and I&#39;ve been honoured to get to interface with the community again. This new version sees numerous and many bugfixes as well as total redesigns of many areas. Definitely check it out even if you&#39;ve played the old version before. I consider this the definitive Surface Tension Uncut version.

[u]Final Update: 06/01/13[/u]
Version 1.1 final is now released, and with that this project is now complete. It&#39;s been a wild ride, everyone, thanks to all those who took part. My involvement with this project is now at its end, I will now move on to working on OaR Uncut.

This map showcases the most meaningful changes from 1.11 to v2.0, and shows nicely the meat of what ST Uncut is really about. Recommend you check it out to gain some insight into the differences!

I strongly recommend that you watch this, to gain insight into my reasoning for changes and certain bugs. This video is a [i]little[/i] outdated, its a few versions old, but the mapset itself hasn&#39;t changed a great deal since then. It gives you a general idea. I will update with a new video soon.

[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b][/SIZE]

This community project was created to remake the sections of Surface Tension which were cut from Black Mesa. I strongly felt that the omission of these chapters (namely the map C2A5F from the original Half-Life) strongly harmed the storytelling element of the game, and lessened the impact of Forget About Freeman. Seeing all the battles between the aliens and the HECU in Half-Life was one of the most awesome features of both Surface Tension and C2A5F, and I felt it was something definitely missing from Black Mesa. It also tied the story together - it simply [b]made sense[/b] in Half-Life&#39;s Forget About Freeman when the military decided to pull out, but it didn&#39;t really have the same effect in Black Mesa due to the lack of fighting between the military and aliens as observed by the player.

I&#39;ve aimed to change that, by re-integrating the cut maps. The player will see a lot of fighting between the aliens and the HECU. I&#39;ve redesigned the original maps from Half-Life from scratch and integrated them into BM&#39;s existing campaign. I&#39;ve also modified Black Mesa&#39;s Gargantua chase a fair bit, to make it both less buggy and more exciting. This mod is an add-on to Black Mesa. When you install it, it adds 3 maps to Black Mesa&#39;s Surface Tension chapter, which slot in naturally with the rest of the campaign. It must be added to an existing installation of Black Mesa, and as such requires Black Mesa to work.

[b][u]Implementation[/u][/b][/SIZE]

The three maps are now complete. They tie seamlessly into Black Mesa&#39;s campaign and are AT THE VERY LEAST (I feel!) the same quality as the rest of Black Mesa. I&#39;ve made very careful considerations everywhere and with the extensive help of the community, created a balanced, fun, exciting, and varied experience. In my eyes, Surface Tension now has a fitting finale consistent with the extremely high quality of the rest of the chapter.

My maps tie in seamlessly with the main Black Mesa campaign. If you install my maps and overwrite BM&#39;s existing files, your Surface Tension chapter will be SEAMLESSLY expanded to its original Half-Life 1 length using my maps. You move seamlessly from the Black Mesa dev designed sections of Surface Tension, into mine, and back to their maps again for Forget About Freeman. I&#39;ve done my best to make it a seamless transition experience.

Here&#39;s a brief description of the way in which my expansion works:
[quote]
* Black Mesa&#39;s Surface Tension comprises of the maps C2A5A --&gt; C2A5G
* C2A5G is the final map of ST in Black Mesa, which is where the chapter was heavily cut from its Half-Life 1 version. The Gargantua chase was merged with the &quot;vent drop&quot; scene, and all of C2A5F from Half-Life 1 was cut here. They cut C2A5F out and merged the map with the Garg chase.



[list]
[*]My maps range from C2A5G --&gt; C2A5I.
* This expands ST by 3 maps.
* My 3 maps are basically a re-make of Half-Life&#39;s C2A5F, but dramatically expanded, changed, and hopefully, improved.
* C2A5I is Black Mesa&#39;s Gargantua Chase, but re-imagined slightly.
* My maps flow seamlessly into one another and connect seamlessly with the main campaign.

[u][b][i][url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-surface-tension-uncut/downloads/surface-tension-uncut-v20-installer-version&#39;]Latest Version: 2.0 Final - Final Release (Installer Version). Download here.[/url][/i][/b][/u][/SIZE]
[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]I URGE YOU TO READ THE README AND THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING MY MAPS. I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PROBLEMS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN SOLVED BY READING THE README.

Bear in mind that my maps replace some stock Black Mesa content, so back up stuff you&#39;re not prepared to lose.

[u]How to install:[/u]

Extract the contents of this zip file into your BMS folder. This will install the maps. Make sure you back up your old files - my map pack replaces 2 stock Black Mesa maps: BM_C2A5G, and BM_C3A1A, so back those up. To back them up, go to your BMS folder, then to maps, and then copy and paste them to anywhere of your choosing. If you don&#39;t like my maps or want the old ones back, you can then replace them easily in the future. Also back up your scenes.image file in the scenes folder. This makes my maps incompatible with any mods for BM which changes the scenes.image file. If anyone can figure out how to actually make it compatible, please let me know.

Launch the game.

Open the console. If the console is not enabled, you can find it under advanced options in keyboard settings.

You have 3 options here:

1) Do a complete playthrough of Black Mesa, my maps will appear where they are supposed to automatically
2) Do a playthrough of Surface Tension - my maps will appear where they are supposed to automatically. To start from Surface Tension you can use the new game option or you can alternatively type &quot;map bm_c2a5a&quot; into the console (without the quotation marks) to launch ST.
3) To start from my maps, type &quot;map bm_c2a5g&quot; (without the quotation marks) in the console. This will launch the first map in my set of 3.

[u]Comparison Screenshots:[/u]


![](upload://yvQjzkYRUe1NpNINhkpeLDXoqg7.jpeg)
The first floor of the parking lot has been &quot;grunged&quot; up, darkened, and significantly expanded from its Half-Life 1 variant. It has an extra floor now too and some side areas to explore.


![](upload://cG0yBq38khkno8KYlLDXK6SZfHb.jpeg)
The Garage remains consistent in appearance with the other garages you find throughout Surface Tension. It&#39;s very different to the original, but for the better (I feel!)


![](upload://aK1ZoH3XWHVmxmfsZduVzCZu9FT.jpeg)
The TOW courtyard you come to after breaking free from the garage. I made it an outdoor area consistent with the rest of Surface Tension. A DRAMATIC thematic improvement from the original, which was boring, bland and generic.


![](upload://q52omscqIfO8v5TPJRNMf3m9Twq.jpeg)
Another view of the TOW courtyard. You can see JUST how much I&#39;ve changed it from the original, but you can still recognize traces of the original&#39;s spirit here.


![](upload://6bVnl8MX0xJ7BvIVCqIpnDy9DaJ.jpeg)
Remake of the warehouse war between HECU and Aliens. I replaced it with an outdoor area which provides a much nicer aesthetic and allows for usage of aerial vehicles for dramatic effect. It&#39;s been replaced with a helipad and contains a very nice scripted scene with a Manta destroying an Osprey.


![](upload://jXgbqzZnNXJkyaYWPQcWckkZabp.jpeg)
Another shot of the same scene, a bit later on. The LAV bursts out alongside some marines and cuts down the aliens.


![](upload://skhuVvNudFgFjotrb6uSE72n4DD.jpeg)
From C2A5H, another scene with a large scale battle between the HECU and Aliens. Also quite changed from Half-Life 1&#39;s version. Contains more impressive aerial scripting.


![](upload://R7qUVVqp7doxuzv7SXt3XdiRLk.jpeg)
Another view of the same area. I tried very hard to make the area look war-torn.


![](upload://d2bWObkNazJCi0u9bVvvwnqC4ZB.jpeg)
View of the roof the player must climb onto to progress. Note the 3d skybox in some ways looks like the original.


![](upload://eV8iFf2huLQGPnGzxyrgYEr43Gd.jpeg)
The furnace room housing the fight between the HECU and some headcrabs. I made it much grimier and dirtier than the original, as well as adding a short break in the action here.


![](upload://b2fPp43h0OfE7E8jbUSTfm1zQtT.jpeg)
The scene where you rescue Barney, which I have completely changed with a different theme. The original area here was extremely lackluster and nonsensical, I&#39;ve turned it into a gasworks, which is an interesting theme and has a sensible connection to the furnace room.


![](upload://4pwSj6aeRVtRuvOgFziGeKQMoCQ.jpeg)
My re-imagining of Black Mesa&#39;s Gargantua chase. The Gargantua now bursts through the door, and crushes 2 marines with a tank, similar to the original.


[b][u]Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)[/u][/SIZE][/b]

[b]Q: How does this affect my Black Mesa campaign, or more specifically, Surface Tension?[/b]
A: My map expands gameplay in Surface Tension by 30 - 45 minutes. It ADDS to what&#39;s already there. None of Surface Tension is affected aside from C2A5G, which in Black Mesa&#39;s version of Surface Tension, is the very last map.

[b]Q: I see you&#39;ve included the first map of Forget About Freeman in your release. Why? Do I have to install it?[/b]
A: If you want the maps to link up with the rest of the campaign, then yes. It&#39;s to do with the way Source handles level changing. Linked maps must contain references to one another. Forget About Freeman&#39;s first map (C3A1A) originally had links to C2A5G (the last map of ST under the BM Dev Team&#39;s version). With my extensions, Forget About Freeman is now linked to C2A5I (which under MY version is the last map of Surface Tension). I didn&#39;t change anything else on Forget About Freeman aside from the map linkage. You don&#39;t HAVE to install it, but C2A5I will crash once you complete it if you don&#39;t.
[b]
Q: Will this be integrated into Black Mesa properly, or remain a fan project?[/b]
A: I don&#39;t know! If the devs approach me asking if they can use my stuff, I&#39;m sure as heck going to say yes! I&#39;d be very proud if something like that were to happen. But I have no plans to approach them.

[b]Q: Why was Surface Tension cut so badly?[/b]
A: The mapper left halfway through the project, and there are probably other reasons too. Either way, I don&#39;t blame the team. The rest of Surface Tension was actually brilliant, the biggest problem was it didn&#39;t have a fitting end like it did in Half-Life 1.

[b]Q: How do I install this?[/b]
A: Read the readme.

            <p>Awesome, OAR U is finally out.</p>
<p>So far so good, but I’m getting some framerate drops in areas, I.E. the first section with music (where the military and vortigaunts are going at it) and again when the military turns out the lights in the roundabout. Any fix for this in the near future?</p>
<p>For reference, I’m running this baby on a GTX 980 TI and an i-5 4590 @ 3.30 Ghz, and all my drivers are up to date  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Also, for some reason I got purple textures right after the loadscreen that transitioned the rail-yard to  the rocket area</p>

            <p>As I mentioned before this is no longer a mod or solely Chons (surface tension additions) it should be considered a team effort now. OAR uncut is a different story. Being a team effort also allows the scope to become much larger as such the time it takes to refine the end product is much larger. Don’t  expect this soon.</p>

            <p>I think because people wouldn’t stop posting in it asking when it was coming to Steam BM.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone, I just reactivated my profile due to the update. I just read the first patch notes saying, the size limit has been lifted in Steam Workshop … and as far as I know that was the reason Text couldn’t put up there is uncut mods.  Oh well,  robably he is busy, so we need to wait more.</p>
