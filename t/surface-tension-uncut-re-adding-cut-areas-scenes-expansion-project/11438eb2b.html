<p>I’m looking forward to testing tonight. Can we still expect the video posted today as well? I only ask because I know how long it can take to upload and finish rendering on YouTube. The commentary insight from the creator is always interesting to listen to.</p>
<p>It is a shame about OAR uncut being left at a literal dead end for the time being, but I’m sure something will come of it once you get some fresh eyes on it. I know I’m not the only one that’s really looking forward to seeing it’s completion and can help toss ideas around.</p>

<p>No video tonight. The compiler crashed once during G compile about 25 minutes in (generic Steam error) and just crashed during H compile literally right at the end (about 25 minutes in as well). So, I’ve had to compile each map twice (just started H a second time). And I still haven’t done the test runs/packaging yet! I’m tired as knobs, so definitely want to hop straight into bed after release.</p>
<p>I’ll record the video tomorrow most likely, and the video release will most likely coincide with ST Uncut v2 Final’s release, which will very hopefully be tomorrow as well, provided there aren’t as many crashing issues as there were in the beta. Fingers crossed! Otherwise, I’ll have to spend tomorrow fixing that, rather than working on B2.</p>

          <p>This may be very late, but I think part of the crashing issues have to do with IIopn’s Animation Revamp Project (which is a really cool mod in my opinion) because I’ve gotten a lot less crashes without it than I did when I had it installed into my BMS folder.</p>

          <p>I give up, for now. Really frustrated. I’ve spent the past 3 hours trying to get this to work, compiling new versions, etc, but it’s no good. It’s 3am here, and everything works, except the compiled version of G will not build cubemaps. It keeps getting to the final one and then crashing, and not saving the cubemaps. I’ve tried all kinds of trickery to get it to work but I think for now I need to sleep on it and fix it in the morning. It’s all that’s left though.</p>
<p>Sorry guys, things just legitimately went to shit after I decided the maps were ready. The compilers crashed at the end of EVERY MAP (wasting about an hour and a half TOTAL), then when I found out the cubemaps weren’t working on G (H and I are fine), I had to recompile the map 2 times. It sucks. Sorry. Shit happens, it’s got me quite angry.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll find a fix for it tomorrow. Worst comes to the worst, I’ll just delete a few extraneous cubemaps. That normally ends up fixing it, from my experiences with crashing cubemaps in the past. I’d prefer not to, but I will if I have to. For now, I disappear off to the land of nod, however. Sorry guys. They really are actually completely ready - but fuck the Source engine. Seriously.</p>

          <p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=‘Red’]Update: v2 RC1 Released!</span></span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i"><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/?ql07r3zr6gqf7wo" data-bbcode="true">Latest Version: 2.0 Release Candidate 1. Download here.</a></span></span></span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>Right, here it is, a bit later than expected - Release Candidate 1 of ST Uncut V2!</p>
<p>The aim of this Release Candidate Phase, which was not something I’d originally intended to do, is 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To determine whether the crashing people have been experiencing has been resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To quickly test the waters of a few “experimental changes”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I really have no other goals with the Release Candidate, as I consider this to basically be the finished version of ST Uncut v2. As such, please do not post minor feedback as I simply don’t have the time to work through another phase of changes. Please only post things which are invasive and impactful, as I hope to get the final release out ASAP!</p>
<p>If you wish to help me test the Release Candidate properly, there are some things I’d appreciate you doing to help me speed along the testing process. I’ll outline them for 1 and 2 respectively:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If using Ilopn’s Animation Revamp Project, could you please test my mod with it uninstalled. Though I haven’t verified it personally yet, PCGameCrazy reported that his game seemed to crash a lot less during ST Uncut when he uninstalled it. It’s possible that it might cause problems though I don’t know for sure. Any crashes which occur, could you possibly report to me what the error was (if any) and what you were doing at the time when it crashed. The more detailed the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The changelog below contains 4 “experimental changes”. These are all fairly majorish aspects of the maps which I decided to tweak for RC1, which change a few scenes a little, and haven’t asked the community about. They are also all very easy to revert back to the way they were before. Even if you give feedback on nothing else, please let me know what you think about these 4 changes. Just give a brief opinion, whether you think I should change it back or not, or any superior alternatives you might be able to think of. I’ll single the changes out from the changelog. They are as follows:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>-EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE: Made the vent pieces during the vent drop scene actually collide with the world now, instead of falling through it. They now drop onto the top of the workbench in the garage, and stay  there. They are lightmapped, so unfortunately the lighting doesn’t look great. 50/50 on whether I’ll keep this or not.</p>
<p>-EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE: Added invisible clip brushes around each of the car lifts, which only collide with physics objects. This is to prevent players from moving the red toolboxes underneath them, and experiencing really weird physics glitches as the car lifts go through them and make them spaz out. Also 50/50 on this one, though it does prevent a stupid looking bug, which can happen during normal gameplay (explosions typically). This solution may very well be the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>-EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE: Reworked the Manta/Harrier pathing, to try and reduce the appearance of the running Mantas flying through buildings in the 3d skybox. The new setup isn’t perfect either, but is better than the previous one IMO. I have another, more extreme fix for this (moving parts of the 3d skybox into the map) but that’s a very harsh solution, so I want to know if you guys think the current one suffices. This change took me nearly a whole day to get to where it is now.</p>
<p>-EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE: Changed the grate in front of the Satpipe marine to a much more “dense” one, to try and provide better explanation for why you can’t shoot him. It might make it a bit hard to see the Satchel/Marine though, especially because it’s lit up, and I would be quite happy to change it back to the old texture or even just remove it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Other than that, enjoy the maps please! I’m going to start recording the video now, for release tonight hopefully. After that I’ll start work on B2, so keep an eye on the OaR Uncut thread for more news on that! Thanks everyone! Changelog here:</p>

 CHANGELOG:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>24/06/13</p>
<p>==2.0 Release Candidate 1 (RC1)==</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Assorted/General</span></span><br>
-The biggest change for this version by far is that I attempted to resolve the large number of crashing issues which testers were reporting with v2 Beta, by fixing up broken I/O chains which I’d neglected to delete, and by tidying up certain entity setups. I hope this has toned down crashing significantly, if not removed it entirely. If not, I will endeavour to fix the crashes before final release. The 4 main problem areas to look out for are: the helipad battle, the transition between G and H, the start of the Abrams battle, and the drop down into the water tank by the Satpipe scene.<br>
-Many other small visual/clipping reworks changes. Far too many to list, as per usual.<br>
-There are a fair few “experimental changes” in this version, which I was not expecting to do. Let me know what you think of these. I’ll say what they are before stating the change itself. I REALLY want to hear opinions on these. They are all very easy to revert, too.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">C2A5G</span></span><br>
-Fixed a weird shadow which appeared on one of the crossbeams in the carpark.<br>
-Moved the light sources out from the walls a bit in the carkpark to create a more natural effect.<br>
-Moved the door hinges in the carpark stairwell to the other side to make it less frustrating to go up and down the stairs with the doors open.<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]-EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE: Made the vent pieces during the vent drop scene actually collide with the world now, instead of falling through it. They now drop onto the top of the workbench in the garage, and stay  there. They are lightmapped, so unfortunately the lighting doesn’t look great. 50/50 on whether I’ll keep this or not.<br>
-As a result of the vent pieces now being solid, moved the batteries to behind the big blue crates, as otherwise they’d be covered up by the falling vent pieces and/or clip through them.<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]-EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE: Added invisible clip brushes around each of the car lifts, which only collide with physics objects. This is to prevent players from moving the red toolboxes underneath them, and experiencing really weird physics glitches as the car lifts go through them and make them spaz out. Also 50/50 on this one, though it does prevent a stupid looking bug, which can happen during normal gameplay (explosions typically). This solution may very well be the lesser of two evils.<br>
-Removed the cracks/signs from the wall by the explosive ambush; they were both very glitchy post-explosion.<br>
-Gave the Marine on the balcony by the explosive ambush the “Long Visibility/Shoot” flag, so he will actively engage you from there now.<br>
-A few minor aesthetic tweaks to the TOW Courtyard.<br>
-Removed the weird half curb connecting the garage exterior to the road in the TOW courtyard, instead replacing it with a painted line. Looks a lot more natural now.<br>
-Fixed a few instances of grass clipping through the road in the TOW Courtyard’s car park.<br>
-Tidied up the pipe which ran alongside the garage.<br>
-Fixed a major clipping bug with the ladders in the new Helipad.<br>
-Fixed a slew of clipping railings with Z-Fighting.<br>
-Fixed up the collision models of the large vents on the roof by the Helipad, so that there’s no invisible wall preventing you from walking around there.<br>
-Moved the lamppost by the helipad to the other side of the road, to make the helipad less cramped.<br>
-Added transitional textures to all doors which cross the texture threshold, as well as a block light brush to all exterior doors. This should fix the light bleeding and bad texture blending around doors in the previous version.<br>
-Fixed a whole bunch of floating objects in the new offices. They were flagged as “start asleep,” incorrectly.<br>
-Fixed a bug where the AGrunt in the Offices was waking up prematurely during the Helipad battle, and causing the HECU to aggro to him and run inside the offices, instead of fighting on the Helipad like they should.<br>
-Deleted the scripted sequence for the Zombie at the end of G, in the security office. I strongly suspect this scripted sequence (him banging on the glass window), and the way I’d made the sequence transition between the two levels, might have been causing a lot of the crashing people were experiencing. If people still report it, I may very well just remove the Zombie himself and see if that fixes it.<br>
-Redesigned the red blast door which leads to the transitional area between G/H. Instead of opening upwards through the ceiling and through the roof now, it opens sideways. Though it’s the only door of that kind in Black Mesa to open that way, it looks just fine.<br>
-Fixed up the I/O logic between G and H which dictates which doors open and which doors close. Might help to alleviate the crashing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">C2A5H</span></span><br>
-Fixed some visible nodrawing in the tunnel running alongside the main corridor at the start.<br>
-Fixed a bug where the AGrunt would float in the air while performing his roar.<br>
-Altered the AI relationship so that the Abrams “likes” the player, and that there’s an invisible Line-Of-Sight blocking wall in front of the player for the first 10 seconds of the Abrams battle. This should make it so that the player NEVER gets engaged by the tank before it dies.<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]-EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE: Reworked the Manta/Harrier pathing, to try and reduce the appearance of the running Mantas flying through buildings in the 3d skybox. The new setup isn’t perfect either, but is better than the previous one IMO. I have another, more extreme fix for this (moving parts of the 3d skybox into the map) but that’s a very harsh solution, so I want to know if you guys think the current one suffices. This change took me nearly a whole day to get to where it is now.<br>
-Made the storage room by the security hut more consistent, design wise, with the other rooms found in ST. Made the wall 16 units thick instead of 25, and gave it a window. Also removed the “phantom window”, which was visible from the outside of that area but not on the inside.<br>
-Added a small rock behind the first jump pad, to try and explain why the player can’t jump behind it. The real reason is because the game crashes if you hit the jump pad from certain angles, so I’ve blocked them off using invisible walls.<br>
-Added some more threshold textures for doors around the bathroom area, and added a blocklight to the women’s bathroom to prevent the light bleeding - even though I kinda liked that effect.<br>
-Heightened the lights in the snark hallway so the doors wouldn’t collide with them.<br>
-Reoriented the snark’s spawner so they spawn facing you, instead of facing sideways.<br>
-Reworked the AI for the rooftop chase scene a little, to use a more efficient setup.<br>
-Moved the triggers during the scene where you drop down into the water tank. I think the old setup produced crashes (an autosave and a very intensive trigger were right next to one another), hopefully the new one won’t.<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]-EXPERIMENTAL CHANGE: Changed the grate in front of the Satpipe marine to a much more “dense” one, to try and provide better explanation for why you can’t shoot him. It might make it a bit hard to see the Satchel/Marine though, especially because it’s lit up, and I would be quite happy to change it back to the old texture or even just remove it.<br>
-Redesigned entirely the pipe at the end of the Satpipe tunnel, so that it doesn’t look stupid outside the building.<br>
-Redesigned the “spill safe” corner in the Furnace room so that the visible clipping debris from outside is now covered up.<br>
-Removed many of the scorch marks from the hole in the pipe in the janitor’s room. The ones on the pipe itself were causing visual glitches when the player used the first jump pad.<br>
-Reoriented the Vort outside of the janitor’s closet so he spawns facing you, rather than away.<br>
-Tried to fix the lighting on some of the pipes in the gasworks.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u"><br>
C2A5I</span></span><br>
-Fixed up the 50 Cals clipping through the sandbags.</p>

<p>You may want to move the clip brushes down a number of units so it doesn’t prevent agrunt hornets from reaching the player on the car lift…</p>
<p>Edit: Alright, I’ve got through, but I’m still getting memory issues, it’s usually when I reload the level after I die with a quick save or transition between G/H. I can’t give any suggestions as to how to alleviate that.</p>
<p>“Usually” as in it sometimes occurs, other times it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Based on how much free time I have tonight, I might be able to help you pinpoint the cause of your crashing. If it is crashing in BM code, I should be able to tell you exactly what the issue is.</p>
<p>Do me a huge favor, attach your mdmp file(s) to your posts and I can attempt to debug them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s very kind of you, thank you. I appreciate the effort/thought on my part. I’m really very inexperienced when it comes to crashing and I don’t get them personally, so I can’t really figure out what’s causing them. It’d be good to get some kind of inkling as to what’s doing that if you are able to, provided you have the time, of course.</p>

<p>Okay, I hadn’t considered that. Yeah I can probably just lower it for that particular lift in question, I could even parent it to the lift actually, thinking about it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Possible to change the console on those place already said (behind the destroyed tank) in those control room, u have two enormous windows, but just a little control panel and a table with a computer on it, if u place a big control panel overthere, it makes more sense and u have the prop already… (map G)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purpose of the little cabinet in the TOW yard?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U can still use the old door to go to map H, so u don’t need to use the building, I don’t know if u forgot to make those door inaccessable or just an option to us players, so we can choose the easy way to go to map H or the difficult way to reach it?</p>

          <p>While I wait to hear if more people are getting crashes, I am still pleased that it seems to be mostly transitional/save/load crashes now. That’s still far less than before, so progress has been made.</p>
<p>While we wait, I figure I’ll show you some performance benchmarks I took today to compare v1.11 of C2A5G with v2 of C2A5G. The results have been interesting and not quite what I expected. I look at this in a fair amount of detail, so if you enjoy that stuff, sit back and enjoy. I do hope I haven’t wasted my time too much here!</p>
<p>To take these benchmarks I used Fraps’s benchmarking feature, which is really neat. It measures the Average/Min/Max framerate of any desired section you want. I divided G up into 13 segments, based on location/amount of action. The categories map out a typical playthrough of the map in terms of progression.</p>
<p>The term action refers to the framerate of a section while there is fighting going on of some description. Static just means the scene is “blank,” and nothing happens aside from me running around. I made sure to take the same routes and look in the same directions on both tests for each area to ensure the most reliable results possible. Still, take them with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>The rig I used to test:</p>
<p>Intel i5 2500K @ 3.3ghz<br>
AMD Radeon HD 6950 @ 2GB VRAM<br>
8GB RAM<br>
Windows 7<br>
Game @ 1920X1080, everything on max, full AA and AF</p>

<p>This might be a bit difficult to digest, so I broke it down into an Excel graph which would make a 15 year old studying maths very proud:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="../../uploads/default/original/3X/4/3/43421d5c104cc047459a0440f5e7577d3607d728.jpg" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/43421d5c104cc047459a0440f5e7577d3607d728" title=""><img src="../../uploads/default/original/3X/4/3/43421d5c104cc047459a0440f5e7577d3607d728.jpg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="9AZDIoxirqpBrgh2xrok3ijrLDy" width="690" height="401" data-small-upload="../../uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/3/43421d5c104cc047459a0440f5e7577d3607d728_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1132×659 71.6 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>The large peaks and troughs on the graph are mostly moving from action to static scenes, which does naturally provide a significant difference in performance due to higher number of AI and effects on screen.</p>
<p>One of the interesting overall trends you’ll see on the graph is that the framerates for the action sequences are very similar for v2 and v1.11, aside from the street which is much worse performing in v2. This is probably because the cost of calculating the AI/effects from their fighting doesn’t really change from version to version.</p>
<p>We can see very clearly that the framerate in the Car Park in v2 is SIGNIFICANTLY improved. There is nearly a 35FPS gain when just running around the car park after the fight. The only time the framerate is lower in v2 is during the fight big fight in the Car Park, and that difference is so slight (2 frames) that we can probably chalk that one down to random variables.</p>
<p>I was surprised that the top floor of the car park runs better in v2. The new window should have hurt performance quite a bit. Likely the harm done by the new window forcing the outdoor area to render, is outweighed by the benefits brought on by optimization changes making the lower floors of the car park no longer render in v2. This is good.</p>
<p>The street battle (observed from the hole in the top floor of the car park) performs MUCH worse in v2, something which I hadn’t noticed or anticipated. This is probably because the TOW courtyard, which can be seen from there, is substantially more detailed than before. For my rig at the very least however, this is still well within acceptable bounds.</p>
<p>The Garage running better in v2 is something which surprised me too - considering I made the window leading to the TOW Courtyard transparent for v2. It most likely performs a lot better due to optimization changes I made to the TOW Courtyard using visleaves.</p>
<p>The TOW Courtyard, on average, runs a fair bit worse in v2 compared to v1.11, and still faces the same problem spots. For me, the average framerate during the fight with the Agrunts is 46 in v2, which is still acceptable - but might be very difficult for players with weaker rigs. Bear in mind the difference in action framerates between the two versions for the TOW courtyard is only 2 frames per second, however. When simply walking around the TOW Courtyard, the difference between the 2 versions is 9 FPS in favour of v1.11. This surprised me a bit - I was expecting v2 to run A LOT slower than a 9 FPS difference. Overall I consider this moderate performance drop to be acceptable given the very large increase in visual quality in the TOW Courtyard, though others may not consider that a good compromise.</p>
<p>The Helipad follows much he same trend, with the average difference in FPS being around 10 again.</p>
<p>Overall we can see that the two most improved areas visually by far (the TOW Courtyard and Helipad) have had a 10fps drop on average. This is good news for anyone who had decent framerates before - the new version shouldn’t cause too much of a problem with the game’s smoothness. For those of you with weaker rigs who were having bad framerate issues with v1.11 however, it may very well be wise to steer clear of v2, as it is overall more demanding later on into the map.</p>
<p>Comparing the linear trends (labelled as “linear” on the graph) you can look at the total area between the two lines to figure out how much performance has been gained overall with v2. The center point of the two lines (where they intersect) is the time at which the performance of v1.11 starts to be superior to v2’s performance. The triangular region to the left of that point is the time where v2’s performance is on average better than v1.11.</p>
<p>Comparing those two triangular regions, you don’t even need to precisely measure their area to see that v2’s “performance region” is significantly larger than v1.11’s. I would estimate around 1.5X. This means that in terms of overall performance looking at the level G as a whole, v2 DOES perform better overall, even if it does worse in the more intensive areas.</p>
<p>I’m pleased with this. It could be better, but I’m pleased with it.</p>

<p>Ok. I won’t post too much feedback.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought it was cool that the vent pieces actually collide with the world now. I also thought you did a great job reworking the Manta/Harrier pathing.</p>
<p>I agree that it was a bit hard to see the Satchel/Marine with the new grate. Had to zoom in on him to get a better look. I definitely think you should change it back to the way it was in V2 Beta.</p>
