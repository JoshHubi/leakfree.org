            <p>It took me a while to figure out that the “download” link I was clicking was actually a spam download link. Read the instructions “Please select a download mirror to begin your download.” then select a mirror sight. The actual download will take quite a while.</p>

<p>Steam doesn’t exactly work like that. The shortcuts for games installed via Steam use a game ID number in the shortcut to direct Steam which game to launch. The shortcut itself launches Steam. Here would be my suggestion to try and get this to work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall Black Mesa, Source SDK and Steam completely. Remove all references to all three from your system.</li>
<li>Reboot.</li>
<li>Reinstall Steam first and log into your Steam account.</li>
<li>Reinstall Source SDK 2007.</li>
<li>Reinstall Black Mesa using the setup.exe that can be downloaded with the main mod.</li>
<li>Make sure when the install runs that it is installing to YOUR Steam directory (I don’t know if it defaults to C drive or not, so you should verify this). Do not change the names of any of the default folders it lists in the install.</li>
<li>Once installed the game will launch. Let it launch then shut it down.</li>
<li>Restart Steam. Log into Steam and near the top of the UI is a menu, look for the ‘Library’ menu and click on it. This will bring up a list of all Steam games available to you (even if they aren’t installed). Look for Black Mesa (the list is in Alphabetical order). Double click the game to launch.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you would like a shortcut for the game on your desktop, right click on Black Mesa in your Library and on the little pop up menu select “Create Desktop Shortcut”.</li>
</ol>
<p>If this doesn’t work then I cannot say for sure what the issue is.</p>

<p>Kudos to you sir! Thanks, I didn’t need to do the re-installing, it was just me not understanding that you have to go online to launch the game (that is pretty odd).</p>

            <p>Make sure to allow Source SDK to completely install.</p>
<p>ie: Steam will tell you that it is installing SSDK 07, then after it’s finished that, it will install SSDK 06. Both have to be installed.</p>
<p>Also, don’t touch anything behind the scenes, let the installer do all of the work for you…</p>

            <p>It’s much, much easier if you just obtain the proper install exe guys. Then there is none of this fucking about and its just waiting in your Steam games library.</p>

            <p>hello guys,<br>
i have same problem.I have Windows XP SP3 and Steam is installed on other partition.(I don’t have enough space on partition where is Windows(c:))</p>
<p>the absolute path to Steam is<br>
g:\Steam\</p>
<p>I installed game here<br>
g:\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS<br>
(I have read somewhere it’s not recommeded to change path / folder name.)</p>
<p>I have installed sdk, sdk 2006, sdk 2007 and still nothing.I reinstalled game several times restart Steam…</p>
<p>One time i tried copy files from BMS to<br>
g:\Steam\SteamApps&lt;USERNAME&gt;\source sdk base 2007\hl2<br>
and then(not sure which way worked)<br>
g:\Steam\SteamApps&lt;USERNAME&gt;\source sdk base 2007\sourcetest\</p>
<p>Then I ran SDK2007 via Steam and I saw menu everything like in mod(intro laboratory,but <code>Options</code> in menu didn’t work).Then I started play game and nobody didn’t come open the train door after train trip.(but I saw other models(robots,people who was doing something)).</p>

            <p>I can confirm that restarting Steam fixed this issue for me, however I can’t speak for others.</p>

            <p>Try re-installing Black Mesa. Have Steam and the Source SDK’s already installed, and make sure you install it to steamapps/“your username”/sourcemods/BMS</p>
<p>Unless you are using any configs or other tweaks, that’s all I can tell you.</p>

<p>I can’t seem to launch Black Mesa too. First, I installed Black Mesa, then found out that I don’t have Steam (Duh!), installed it, Source SDK, 2006, 2007. Then turned off Steam, put Black Mesa to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods. Turned on Steam, Black Mesa appeared on the games list. I push play, the window appears, saying Launching Black Mesa, then it disappears and nothing happens. Can’t seem to find logs.<br>
I’m running Windows 7 Ultimate 64x on Asus K43TK notebook. All drivers are up to date.</p>

<p>Having the same problem. If I install it, it launches after install.</p>
<p>Other than that I dont have a way to start the game.</p>

            <p>It should show up in your Steam games list after installing.</p>
<p>Do you have Source SDK Base 2007? You can find it from Steam’s tools menu.</p>
