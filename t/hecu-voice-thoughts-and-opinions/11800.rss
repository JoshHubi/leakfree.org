    <description>Exactly what it says on the tin: What&#39;s your take on the voice acting for the HECU troops? Would you say portraying them as corny 80&#39;s style henchmen (rather than the professional military force they actually are in game) was the best decision to make on part of the developers? Share your thoughts.</description>

</aside>
<p>There’s a lot of lines that don’t match up, gruff has more lines in some areas whereas young has more lines in others. I moved some things around to make them all match up nicely. Moving everything over works, but not perfectly, which is why I did it one by one.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s kinda tedious, I just went through and replaced each file manually, moved some sounds around to where they would fix, renamed a bunch of them, and made small edits to npc_sounds_human_shared.txt and npc_human_grunt.txt</p>
<p>I would just upload them for simplicity, but I don’t know if the devs would look down upon that, and getting in contact with any of them is pretty hard nowadays. :zip:</p>

            <p>I always likes the idea of the Commander having the gruff voice and everyone having younger voices, I dunno who or when it was decided to give everyone gruff voices. I don’t know if that’s still possible to do though, I’d try it but my skill at scripting doesn’t go passed editing variables in text files and adding lines to things (such as giving the vorts extra “alert” lines).</p>

            <p>They changed the voices to gruff because that’s what they thought people wanted. It turns out that the people don’t know what the fuck they want and no one should listen to them.</p>

            <p>I ended up replacing all the grunt lines with the young grunt lines, and I think the results are pretty satisfying. They don’t sound cold and calculating like they did in Half-Life, but they sound a lot more down-to-earth, and less like an 80’s B-movie stereotype at best, and children’s cartoon villains at worst.</p>

<p>The voice acting for the soldiers wasn’t that bad - Their voices ought to sound deeper with less emotion though, rather than cheesy. I agree that maybe the guy who did them wasn’t the right guy.</p>

            <p>I think the voice acting is quite professional and nicely done, although it doesn’t quite fit in this dark and serious atmosphere of Black Mesa.<br>
It’s like putting some comedian character in dramatic play.</p>

            <p>I can’t believe I didn’t notice this until now, but it seems the soldiers never use the “hgrunt_young” voice for some reason. Or well, someone told me that medics use it, but howcome no others? It’s a shame, I prefer that voice over the tough guy voice that they decided to go with.</p>
<p>They should have stuck to the original design of making the young voice for generic soldiers and the tough guy voice for the squad leaders.</p>

            <p>Voice acting isn’t bad. However, the problem is that implementation of these voices are a bit off. For example, when a HECU marine gets gibbed, it shouldn’t yell :“ARGGEGEAGSDKFJKSF!!!” Also, there are times when it says things it shouldn’t, like the moment you enter a map, and they don’t see you yet, they still say:“DOOO IT” or “I’m tired of playing games, freeman!!”. The thing is that the soldiers say something every time you are in the same area as them, regardless if they see you or not. So it isn’t poor voice acting, just poor implementation (BM’s devs work is still amazing though)</p>

            <p>It’s the finest voice acting I ever seen.<br>
So of course, as somebody already pointed out, those voices would fit better if the HECU actually looked like in HL1 (=arrogant pricks), but still, the decision of making it over the top rocked.<br>
You can’t ask for it to be serious, because the first Half-Life isn’t totally a serious game. It’s a parody of that sort of movies where everything fucks up. There was plenty of black humor (the scientists’s screams, their idle lines asking who ate all the donuts, etc), and that’s what made the atmosphere so consistent.<br>
The only reason the HECU’s voices didn’t look the same is because they wanted them to say a lot of stuff and they had to find a way to make this possible (using cut-off words to make dialogues) though you could still feel that intention of making them nonserious, by earing the 2 marines talking after they captured Freeman (A body ? What body ?)</p>

            <p>They’re voices are not that bad. They’re very competent, and I like how arrogant the marines sound. I also liked how the two dialogue scenes near the rocket launch section were acted. The marines cleary don’t understand what the hell is actually going on in BM, and some even voice reluctance in what they’re doing.  The lines definitely sounded much clearer in the mod, with the aid of subtitles of course. I really don’t understand what level of acting you want the marines to sound like.</p>
<p>If you want them to sound more convincing then they are here, then why not get some real marines to do their voices? One is my best friend, and the intensity of his voice would probably make Gordon soil his pants.</p>

            <p>I don’t think they’re really portrayed that campy. For what it is, it’s fine. I hear them screaming in pain more than talking, anyway.</p>

            <p>As compromising as that sounds, I can’t imagine the styles blending together without one standing out over the other. The current lines themselves already do that with the rest of the game.</p>

            <p>I don’t really like them, personally I would have preferred a mix of over the top movie / game style characters (older action movies, video games, goes without saying really), and down to earth style characters (war dramas (such as bob) are good examples) for the two voices.</p>
