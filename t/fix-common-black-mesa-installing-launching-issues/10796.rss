    <title>[FIX] Common Black Mesa installing &amp; launching issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fix-common-black-mesa-installing-launching-issues/10796</link>
    <description>This is a frequent occurrence that I been seeing with a number of users and decided to put a quick and easy list of solutions.

[u]The installer can&#39;t find the archive[/u]
1. Silly question but... is the archive in question BlackMesa.7z actually missing? If so, go download it again or find another website for the full package.
2. In some cases, the installer will think the archive is missing regardless if it is present. As an alternative, download 7zip and extract the mod to the proper dictionary on your PC.

[u]Black Mesa doesn&#39;t show up in my Steam Library[/u]
1. The mod wasn&#39;t installed in the correct location. Try reinstalling to the following dictionary: ...Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS
2. If you changed the folder name &quot;BMS&quot; to something else, Steam may not find it. Unusual behavior in-game may occur otherwise.

[u]Black Mesa crashes on start/&quot;could not find library client&quot;[/u]
1. You don&#39;t have the correct Source SDK (2007) or equivalent installed. You can download the recommended SDK for free through Steam under Library&gt;Tools.
2. Crucial data may be corrupt or missing, preventing the mod from launching. If an .MD5 file was provided with the mod, use a utility to verify file integrity.
You should see 2 files listed with the status OK. If not, one of the files is corrupted and must be downloaded again.
3. Your PC hardware may not have a SSE2-capable CPU. This is required in order to run Black Mesa.

If there are any other suggestions to fixing the problem, feel free to post it below. You&#39;re welcome.  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>Steam would be able to find it most of the times, but the game would misbehave. Most common problem caused by this one is no text displayed in achievements notifications and achievements dialog.</p>

<li>If you’re on a PC with Athlon XP or AMD Semptron for Socket A, or have any other CPU that does not supports SSE2 - you’re out of luck: BM require SSE2-capable CPU to work. You could use CPU-z free tool to check if your CPU supports SSE2 or not (most modern CPU do, starting from Pentium 4 for Intel and Athlon 64 for AMD).</li>
