    <title>VOX lines for Office Complex</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vox-lines-for-office-complex/13772</link>
    <description>I just noticed in the sound files, there are lines for the female VOX clearly meant to be played during Office Complex titled C1A2_x, with x ranging from 00 to 11. However, in the game_sounds_announcement.txt file these are omitted entirely, and they never play during Office Complex or anywhere.

To the BM devs: Was this an accidental omission, or was it on purpose? Will adding in the respective entries for the sound files enable them to play during Office Complex, or were the maps not set up to play any VOX lines during that chapter from the beginning? Will they be re-implemented in the retail release?</description>

            <p>I’m not talking about the WGH and afterwards VOX.  I’m talking about unused VOX lines that were left in the game files that are meant to be played in Office Complex (as they directly reference Sector D, Administration Office, the flooded room in the beginning of Office Complex with the vent, etc.)</p>

            <p>The thing is, at least in my opinion, is that you are inundated with VOX lines in the beginning.  In AM and UC, there are VOX lines playing almost constantly every 30 seconds or something.  Then suddenly in OC, it just kind of disappears and never returns until its sudden re-appearance in WGH.  In my opinion, having a few of those unused VOX lines playing like, every 5-10 minutes or something, would be a better compromise.</p>

            <p>Pretty sure you are right Cpl. at the very least, for the most part. I seem to remember them tweaking something so you are not inundated with the chatter. Downside is that it also caused unforeseen consequences. One being that the all famous line of “thank you and have a very safe and productive day” was inadvertently omitted.</p>

            <p>Off the top of my head I suspect their omission was done on purpose to not overuse vox in earthbound. I don’t believe any of the entity work is in place for the Office Complex maps to play VOX lines so that’d have to be done first before you’d hear them.</p>
<p>As to whether or not they’ll get added down the line I am not sure.</p>
