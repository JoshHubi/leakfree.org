    <title>Wishlist of things for Deathmatch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wishlist-of-things-for-deathmatch/14013</link>
    <description>Hello
First off, I would like to say that I am currently enjoying the release of the Multiplayer. I would like to share a few suggestions on how it could be a lot cooler. Again these are ideas, feel free to agree or disagree

Spectator Mode:

* [u][b]Ability to see Avatar, Player name, Health and Ammo, and Current Weapon[/b][/u]  --  The Killcam info box is a good example of knowing what the player used. That same information box could be usable in spectator mode for casters
Free-For-All Deathmatch:
* [u][b]1[sup]st[/sup], 2[sup]nd[/sup], and 3[sup]rd[/sup] place info on Free-For-All Deathmatch[/b][/u]  --  Status on who’s first, second or third on the top left of the screen labeled as “Current Leaders” in the HEV HUD
Team Deathmatch:
* [u][b]See your Teammate’s status (Health, Armor, and Current Weapon)[/b][/u]  --  Have the ability to see your Teammate’s status on the top left of the screen labeled “My Teammates” in the HEV HUD
Server Settings:
* [u][b]Allow the ability to restrict Weapons[/b][/u]  --  Allow server owners to restrict what weapons can be used on the server

* [b][u]Bots for Practicing Maps[/u][/b]  --  Bots for practicing new maps, weapons, or skills to try out before entering the Multiplayer experience.


This is my wish list of things I wish to be in the game. Again, if you agree, disagree, want to pelt eggs at me, reply below!  :smiley:
