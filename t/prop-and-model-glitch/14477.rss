    <title>Prop and Model Glitch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/prop-and-model-glitch/14477</link>
    <description>Hello, Black Mesa Development Team and forums. This is my first post, but I&#39;ll cut to the chase. For some reason, the scientists ties are flopping around oddly, and same with the potted plant prop.
The Tau Cannon&#39;s little tube connecting the two parts on occasion will start doing the same thing.  Thank you, A concerned gamer.  :slight_smile:</description>
