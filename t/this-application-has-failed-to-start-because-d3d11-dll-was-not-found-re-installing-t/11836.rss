This application has failed to start because d3d11.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.
[/quote]
...is what happens when I try to play AC3.

anyone know what this is and what to do about it? (and yes, I have tried reinstall- didn&#39;t work.)

I have a feeling its something to do with directx 11, which incidently is another issue I have- My graphics card supports directx 11 but I only have Directx 10; whenever I try to download directx 11 it says that my directx is up to date and so it doesn&#39;t need to install, which clearly is wrong.

anyone able to help? 

deepest thanks.</description>
