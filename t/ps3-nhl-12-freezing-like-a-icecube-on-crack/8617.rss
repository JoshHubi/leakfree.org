    <title>[PS3] NHL 12 freezing like a icecube on crack</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ps3-nhl-12-freezing-like-a-icecube-on-crack/8617</link>
    <description>I recently bought NHL12 on the PS3. The first few days I just spent my time playing regular games against the AI as well as toying around in the practice modes.

But today I wanted to start a Be A Pro game, and it keeps freezing either mid-game or during the loading of an autosave. Everything just stops moving, only the camera seems to finish the animation it had started when the game had the fit. The buttons aren&#39;t responsive anymore apart from the PS Home button to quit the game.

This is the actual game freezing, not the console. I can still go back to the PS3&#39;s main menu and play a demo or whatever without actually resetting the console.

Does anyone else have this problem with NHL12 or any other EA Sports &#39;12 game and now how to fix it (if at all)?</description>

            <p>Disconnecting myself from PSN does seem to do the trick. Hasn’t locked up once.</p>
<p>Thanks SkaningeN!</p>

            <p>Hmm. I’ll try that next.</p>
<p>EA’s solution didn’t seem to help. First time I tried loading a saved game after following their advice the loading locked up at 100%. Haven’t seen it happen since, though.</p>
<p>Also, Canucks &gt; Devils. But thanks for the advice anyway!</p>

            <p>Im a huge hockeyfan and I buy NHL every year for PS3.</p>
<p>To fix the issue when the game freezes during loading one of your saved files, don’t sign in to playstation network or shut down the internet connection.</p>
<p>For the game freezing during gameplay. It has happened a couple of times for me aswell, nothing you can do really. But for me it does not happen that often and I still use the bigger version of the PS3, not slim. We can’t expect any more updates to the game anymore so I think you just need to live with it Im afraid.</p>

            <p>The disk is pretty pristine. No finger prints and can’t notice any scratches.</p>
<p>EA support told me to backup the savegames and then delete all the NHL data on the PS3 and try the savegames again. So far so good, apparently. Would be quite bummed if it happens again after playing half a season, but there you go.</p>

            <p>it’s because the density of the disc is so high that some scratches that are unnoticeable to the eye may be preventing the laser from reading the data</p>

            <p>Scratches are less likely to be the problem with a PS3 game, since Blu-Ray discs either use scratch resistant plastic, or they have some kind of scratch resistant coating. (I know it’s one or the other, can’t remember which)</p>
<p>I would guess it’s because it’s an EA sports game that isn’t Madden on their secondary console.  Unfortunately.  I’d test it out and see if the problem happened for me too, but I don’t want to give EA any more money than I have to.</p>

            <p>This usually goes without saying, which is why I’m going to say it. Did you check to see if there is any scratches or if the disc is dirty (fingerprints and that sort of thing). Usually freezes and stuttering is caused by the console having a hard time reading the disc. Of course as sersoft says it may be a bug or a defective disc.</p>

            <p>EA games have terrible bugs, especially EA sports.</p>
<p>I don’t have a PS3 though so can’t really help beyond suggesting you get the disc replaced.</p>
