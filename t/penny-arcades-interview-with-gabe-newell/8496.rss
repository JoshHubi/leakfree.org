    <title>Penny Arcade&#39;s interview with Gabe Newell</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/penny-arcades-interview-with-gabe-newell/8496</link>
    <description>Penny Arcade Report (I had no idea they had such a thing) just posted their interview with VALVe cofounder and managing director Gabe Newell. 

[url=&#39;https://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/valves-gabe-newell-talks-wearable-computers-rewarding-players-and-whether-w/all&#39;]https://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/valves-gabe-newell-talks-wearable-computers-rewarding-players-and-whether-w/all[/url]

As I read through it, it is clear the parallels between VALVe and our friendly neighborhood BM development team. Gabe Newell explains that he mostly does odd jobs fixing up areas that need it, &quot;Whether it’s game design, or business issues, or writing, or programming, or anything&quot; which seems very similar to the recent rumblings of developers filling in areas others have been slow together to. He also talks about how they are working on HL Ep 3, but in a reaction to fans getting upset by delays they don&#39;t want to show anything as not to get people&#39;s hopes up before they are ready. I wonder if this philosophy is actually influenced by the state of BM or the other way around. Please, discuss. The link I have left below is a rough summary of the interview from GameTrailers.

            <p>That beard is what all true warriors strive for</p>
<p>/offtopic</p>
<p>I’d have to say that Valve’s development is a lot more secret than the devs. Valve hasn’t even announced the new Half Life, while the BM devs have not only announced it, but have released an assortment of media on it.</p>
<p>Valve’s form of development is more rage inducing, obviously, and is prone to causing a big internet hullabaloo if they announce that they’re not working on any Half Life game. If the BM devs were to announce that the mod was dead, it would be rage inducing, because they’ve been working on it for a long ass time and people have been waiting for the entirety of that long ass time.</p>
<p>Bscly: Valve and BM devs are developing differently, but both would raise hell should they’re game/mod be announced dead.</p>

            <p>…"with Half Life 1 it was a year after we originally said it would be, Half Life 2 basically if you go and read the forum posts apparently took us fifty or sixty years to get done so we’re trying to be careful not to get people too excited and then have to go and disappoint them. So we’re sort of reacting in the other direction and saying ‘okay, well let’s have things a little more baked before we start getting people all excited about it.’ ”</p>

<p>“We’re acutely aware of how much we annoy our fans and it’s pretty frustrating to us when we put them into that situation. We try to go as fast as we can and we try to pick the things that we think are going to be most valuable to our customers and if there’s some magic way we can get more work done in a day then we’d love to hear about it, but we recognize that it’s been a long time whereas we have so many games that people really love–Counterstrike, Half Life, Portal, Left 4 Dead, not a whole lot of Ricochet enthusiasts out there, and at the same time we want to be making sure that those games and those stories and those characters are moving forward while also making sure that we don’t just get into terminal sequelitis.”</p>
<p>Implied, really but out of a new CS, HL, Portal, or L4D which one do you think people are waiting on.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Penny Arcade Report (I had no idea they had such a thing) just posted their interview with VALVe cofounder and managing director Gabe Newell.</p>
<p><a href="https://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/valves-gabe-newell-talks-wearable-computers-rewarding-players-and-whether-w/all" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/valves-gabe-newell-talks-wearable-computers-rewarding-players-and-whether-w/all</a></p>
<p>As I read through it, it is clear the parallels between VALVe and our friendly neighborhood BM development team. Gabe Newell explains that he mostly does odd jobs fixing up areas that need it, “Whether it’s game design, or business issues, or writing, or programming, or anything” which seems very similar to the recent rumblings of developers filling in areas others have been slow together to. He also talks about how they are working on HL Ep 3, but in a reaction to fans getting upset by delays they don’t want to show anything as not to get people’s hopes up before they are ready. I wonder if this philosophy is actually influenced by the state of BM or the other way around. Please, discuss. The link I have left below is a rough summary of the interview from GameTrailers.</p>
