    <description>Now i&#39;d like to know what you prejudice bastards(just kidding, I love you guys :3) think about Fallout: New Vegas. I&#39;d also like to know if yall will be buying it or not.

I shall be purchasing this fine digital creation. Obviously, my current view on the game is positive. I believe it shall be very fun indeed, especially with all of it&#39;s newest features.

Try to be respectful in you&#39;re response. I don&#39;t want to have to read through a whole lotta badly writtin rage text.</description>

            <p>Yeah, but it has been upgraded. The physically simulated objects (including some containers in addition to ragdolls <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) have many more material sounds. Now wood sounds like wood, ashtrays sound like glass ashtrays, etc. Gamebryo has finally gotten to the point in physics where HL2 was 5 years ago!</p>

<p>Pirated it, played it, enjoyed it more than Fallout 3 (which I really hated for some reason), but it won’t be getting any GOTY nominations from me. Its pretty fun, but nothing ground breaking.</p>

</aside>
<p>Considering it’s still using Fallout 3’s engine and was made for those who wanted more Fallout, i don’t think it was made to be ground breaking.</p>
<p>But you’re right it’s good fun.</p>

            <p>If the rest of the game is anything like the first hour, then I am going to burn in hell for pirating it if I don’t buy it. New Vegas is fucking amazing.</p>

            <p>I have to say it’s pretty fun. Like Fallout 3, but mixed with a western.<br>
Of course, I have yet to see an assault rifle, more than one frag grenade, or a raider, but… It’s fun, and the mixing in of new towns and re adding of ingredients from Oblivion is great.</p>

            <p>Good game, <span class="bbcode-i">but by gods the wasteland in this game is such a fucking wasteland</span>. I know that sounds bratty but in Fallout 3 I felt there was a bit more personality and uniqueness to the areas you could explore. Besides that, I felt that there was a small lack of polish and content but that doesn’t mean it isn’t fun and not deserving of a $60 purchase.</p>
<p>Also I’m signing up for Fallout Online’s beta coming 2012 and have been following that and becoming part of their forums so I’m interested in how that one turns out.</p>

            <p>Shrapnel wound up in the Talon Company camp for you? He wound up in Paradise Falls for me. On my evil file. All the slavers are dead, and I was just starting to get a lot of caps from them too. It really sucked.</p>

            <p>Like that one time I was doing the “Strictly Business” Quest in FO3, and Flak somehow got to the opposite end of the map and on top of an unclimbable rock, or that other time I had already enslaved him and Shrapnel was walking around the Talon Company camp, leaving a shitton of corpses in his wake because he’s an essential character and can’t die. Good times.</p>

            <p>I have found that with Bethesda games, and from what I hear it applies here, is that one’s enjoyment is based upon how many horrible glitches you encounter that force you to restart the game, or screw around in the console. They make great games, but they really need to fix that.</p>

<p>They should certainly note there are glitches, depending on how big the glitches are is the question of being marked down a score.</p>

<p>It really is damn good aside from the glitches. Much better than Fallout 3.</p>
<p>It kind of makes me want to replay KOTOR 2, maybe with the missing content mod to make it less broken. Obsidian has the best writers in western RPGs right now, if not RPGs period. (I’m waaaaay out of the Japanese loop. Last one I played was FFIX, so I don’t have a clue where they’re at)</p>
