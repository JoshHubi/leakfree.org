    <title>Some ideas for after Xen is completed</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-ideas-for-after-xen-is-completed/62175</link>
    <description>So I have some ideas I was thinking of when the Black Mesa Devs finish the Xen levels. I know before that I thought of doing remakes of Blue Shift and Opposing force before being told someone else is on that. But recently I thought of something else. I have been getting into playing Sven Co-op a bit and I noticed that Half Life is a multiplayer experience now and thought that would be an awesome idea to do that in Black Mesa in where we could have a multitude of players play together in the same levels. That is one idea and before all of you say that it would take a long time (or short time, idk) to happen, there is one other thing I thought of. The other thing I thought of was when I found the game &quot;They Hunger&quot; while playing Sven and found out it was at one point going to be redone in source but the team fell under. So I am thinking of remaking that game because I must admit in all honesty it looks great in concept but in the gold source engine it looks odd to be kind. I think a source overhaul would look great and I think it would be a great achievement to see that game look remade in source. So let me know what you guys think and get back to me.</description>
