    <title>Moved: Counter Strike Source Map Search - de_blackmesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/moved-counter-strike-source-map-search-de-blackmesa/2664</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve searched, and I&#39;ve searched, and I&#39;ve searched, however I can&#39;t for the life of me remember where I originally downloaded this map. I lost the files that are particular to the map, so now when I play it, I get that pink &quot;texture&quot; that basically states that you&#39;re missing certain textures. The map is awesome (though not nearly as awesome as the BMS mod), but it was pretty sweet to play CS in the Black Mesa facility. I figured, if any community could help me with this one, the BMS community could. The files that I have are below:

If anyone could help me with this one, it would be greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>I figured it was old, since I last downloaded it almost two years ago.</p>
<p>Also, the link you provided came up and said the download limit had been reached. If someone could download it and post it on their own server, that’d be awesome. Until then, I’ll keep trying, and this lead is better than anything I got before. Thanks guys.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Straw</span>, even though the textures are missing, your computer makes things look so much better than what mine can handle.</p>
<p>Edit: Well, it looks like that isn’t the actual map anyways. We need a .bsp file, instead of an “ain.bz2” which looks like it’s a graphs file, which is what I’m most likely missing from the version I have. I shall dig though.</p>
<p>Edit [AGAIN]: I dug, and that source, doesn’t actually have the map. What they have is just leftover in their graphs folder. Plus, he’s maxed out his download limit anyways.</p>

<p>Some server has it in their maplist…</p>
<p>EDIT: You have an outdated version, the latest one is de_blackmesa_v7…<br>
