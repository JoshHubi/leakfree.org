            <p>This is a known bug with our newly written recoil system, we will fix it at a later date.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-s">This probably isn’t a bug as all weapons feature a kick, however I would agree that it needs fixing.</span> Apparently it is a bug!</p>
<p>It is fine for other weapons due to low fire-rate, however the crow-bar actually makes me feel sick (which is pretty impressive, I do virtual reality research as part of my job and they don’t even make me feel ill).</p>
<p>I would suggest either removing the kick or interpolating it into a smooth swing, so it is more like the camera represents the swing motion, rather than a kick-back (which doesn’t make much sense).</p>
