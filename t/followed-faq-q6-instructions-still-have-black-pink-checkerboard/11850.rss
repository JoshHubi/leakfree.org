    <title>Followed FAQ Q6 instructions. Still have black/pink checkerboard.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/followed-faq-q6-instructions-still-have-black-pink-checkerboard/11850</link>
    <description>I followed the FAQ Q6 instructions to make sure hardware DirectX is set to 9, but I am still getting a black/pink checkerboard pattern when under &quot;waste water&quot;. What else can be done to fix this problem? :|

Here&#39;s the strange thing: I&#39;ve tried &quot;finding my way&quot; under the water even though all I can see on the screen is the checkerboard.  When Gordon finally runs out of oxygen and drowns then the checkerboard goes away and I can actually see under the water.  Why can I see under the water after Gordon is dead, but not while he is swimming?  Very strange.</description>

<p>Here’s the strange thing: I’ve tried “finding my way” under the water even though all I can see on the screen is the checkerboard.  When Gordon finally runs out of oxygen and drowns then the checkerboard goes away and I can actually see under the water.  Why can I see under the water after Gordon is dead, but not while he is swimming?  Very strange.</p>
