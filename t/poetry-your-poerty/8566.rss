    <description>Let&#39;s this be thread where you post [u][b]YOUR[/b][/u] Lyrics, as encouragement I&#39;ll start:

my heart being caged
soul being raged
the distance between us
never engaged

blood filled with pain
spilled in the rain
for the forsaken
drown in the taint

            <p>lol thanks man</p>
<p>That long one was something I had to do for English. We were studying Walt Whitman and his poem “Song of Myself” and we were instructed to make a poem in his style. It could be about anything we wanted, so I chose that.</p>
<p>“Numbers” was written in math, ironically enough.</p>
<p>Yours was also well written. Nice use of imagery.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>“Song of Awakening”</p>
<p>Considering all that has transpired in my life and in existence,<br>
Considering all that has taken place here, on our own planet, on Earth,<br>
I have come to the conclusion that we are nothing,<br>
Yet we are also something, something indescribable.</p>
<p>Man is bound in an existence which he believes he knows,<br>
Yet in reality, he does not know,<br>
He merely assigns labels of fact and truth to everything,<br>
And instructs others to commit these labels to memory,<br>
As if they hold anything of true value.</p>
<p>I had once held this façade as one would hold a newborn,<br>
I had believed in and regurgitated what I believed was knowledge,<br>
I sunk myself, drowned in this information, truly believing,<br>
Believing that I was learning.</p>
<p>All the world, I thought, was being unraveled,<br>
It was all being made clear to my ignorant mind,<br>
My name would be up there with that of Newton, maybe Einstein, even,<br>
No one would dare question my logic and judgment,<br>
One giant label constricting my mind,<br>
I loved it!</p>
<p>Then the question appeared, like lightning on a night you were hoping to get some well deserved 	rest,<br>
Why do these things happen, why do these thing act the way they do?<br>
How do they truly function?<br>
What, or whom, do they function for?<br>
Are we an imaginary world in the mind of a dreaming God,<br>
Asleep when he is awake and awake when he is asleep?</p>
<p>I could feel the label failing, the adhesive waning,<br>
I clung to it like a kid to a Wal-Mart smiley sticker,<br>
Awarded to each young mind, shopping with their parents, feeling like grown-ups,<br>
So that they may convince their guardians to allow them to shop there further,<br>
I didn’t want to leave this world I knew,<br>
Or thought I knew.</p>
<p>All my understanding I would feel fading away,<br>
Like mascara in a May shower,<br>
Haunting your face with a decrepit appearance,<br>
An appearance quite the opposite of what such a device was meant for,<br>
It was a form forgotten to my eyes, greatly foreign in its shape and design.</p>
<p>I felt I no longer understood the world, as if all I had learned was for nothing,<br>
And something more haunting, yearning, had taken its place,<br>
It shook every fabric of my being, my mind, becoming me.</p>
<p>Every face that I thought I knew was that of a Chinaman,<br>
Or like that of an ancient Egyptian, working on the pyramids that I took for granted,<br>
An old war torn Indian, smiling, offering me his hand, as if congratulating me on my numerous 	kills,<br>
Baring faces not of my time or place.</p>
<p>I attempted to block myself from these visages,<br>
I didn’t want to see what reality really was,<br>
The very thought of something being other than what I was taught,<br>
Or differing from conclusions brought on by great Scientists of every area known to man,<br>
It scared me to no end, thinking that I truly knew nothing.</p>
<p>I attempted to rewrap the label, to tape it, staple it into place,<br>
But the damage had already been done,<br>
What had been seen could not be unseen,<br>
And I am left with the image of what truly is,<br>
Not what we believe it is.</p>
<p>The label would not stay,<br>
It was a mere child’s playpen, holding back the young brute,<br>
Until he grew large enough, strong enough to break those walls of varying color,<br>
To cast away his cage, whether by an accident of his newfound strength,<br>
Or eventually through his father, believing he had suffered enough.</p>
<p>I had broken the cage, unaware of my strength, of what I bore,<br>
The whole world was mine to roam, to discover, to play with,<br>
No longer tied to that simple existence,<br>
Consisting of those lettered blocks and multi-colored walls baring joyful animals of many 	varieties.</p>
<p>It all scared me, I didn’t want to leave the world that I was accustom,<br>
All of it seemed blasphemous, strange and wrong,<br>
I wanted none of it,<br>
Calling upon a spirit of greater repute than my own,<br>
I begged for guidance, yet there was none,<br>
The door had already been made apparent,<br>
And it couldn’t be any more obvious.</p>
<p>It was time for me to leave this building that I had called home,<br>
Four walls, that I had come to realize, were trapping me,<br>
Constricting my thinking, blocking the truth,</p>
<p>I remember that first step into the truth, and it was glorious,<br>
Something that I will never forget, something that will guide my actions for years to come,<br>
It did not kill me, as my previous thoughts would have you believe,<br>
It was different, but welcoming; a breath of fresh air after one’s sentence is through,<br>
Feeling every molecule of oxygen fill your lungs, not wanting to let it go,<br>
Then you release and let out a warm smile, welcoming the future.</p>
<p>I shook hands with the Chinamen, the Egyptians and Indian,<br>
They were all my friends, possessing a new uniqueness, a curiosity of sorts,<br>
True knowledge could now be found, I know how the world works and it is glorious,<br>
Everything is great, and everything is average,<br>
Baring the power of a God and the stench of a vagrant,<br>
All is unique in many ways, a treasure to be held dear, and to cast away into the bin.</p>
<p>I looked back to the door that once bore me, held me close,<br>
I gave it a sincere smile and a wave, for I would never occupy those walls again,<br>
I could never occupy those walls again,<br>
Because once you see, you can’t go back,<br>
You can’t fix the glass once it has been shattered,<br>
You can only take a step outside and breathe the fresh air,<br>
Awakening your lungs to something different, filling.</p>
<p>This was my story, one that you may not understand,<br>
For what has opened my eyes,<br>
What was I scared of, what was I afraid to bare?<br>
What may be clear to me may seem foreign to you,<br>
Enlightenment is different for all of us,<br>
For we all see differently, yet ultimately, we all see the same.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Façade</span></span></p>
<p>[i]A wheelchair manifests an absence of feet<br>
Imprisoned in the body that is the holding cell<br>
Crippled hopeless, false faced<br>
Entangled in confinement of one’s own hell</p>
<p>Masks can’t disguise<br>
Bodies drowning in misery<br>
Just a look in the eyes<br>
Shows the turmoil feeds internally</p>
<p>Rendered useless until death<br>
Self destruction following the last breath<br>
Behind the smile, the mind is bent<br>
Mentally lost in one’s own torment[/i]</p>
<p>(I made this for school for my Advanced English IV class using Photostory3 to present it)</p>
<p>Explanation: This poem is about people hiding behind figurative “masks” to conceal their true emotions and how the inability to use your legs, such as a crippled person, is very troubling emotionally and physically entrapping. I also used a very badass <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei0XIkSK86Q&amp;feature=related" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">orchestral rendition of Metallica’s famous song “One”</a> which is about a soldier who lost his sight, hearing, legs, arms, and will to live.</p>

            <p>A POEM:</p>
<p>Drunk people on the street<br>
Drunk people wearing stupid hats<br>
Drunk guy holding a dog<br>
Drunk lady shouting at guy holding a dog<br>
Drunk guys smoking a blunt on the sidewalk<br>
Also they are high<br>
Drunk gay guy hitting on cashier in Whole Foods really loudly<br>
Drunk people shouting “Jameson”<br>
Drunk people spilling green beer<br>
Drunk little orange women that look like leprechaun prostitutes<br>
Drunk people getting drunk<br>
I hate St. Patrick’s Day</p>

And I think and  I float<br>
About walking and driving a car<br>
And I float and I think<br>
And I think and i float<br>
Since I’m just a brain in a jar…</p>
<p>Can’t remember where I heard this one but I got a kick outta it.</p>

            <p>I don’t think i have written any spring poems but here are two about midsummer:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Ode to fishy love</span></span></p>
<p>i am the master<br>
of this gibbous skiff<br>
you are my comely<br>
counselor and concubine</p>
<p>for herring we row,<br>
daring cliff after cliff<br>
they leap with such delight,<br>
lets take a dip</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Bloater (Too many in the Cask)</span></span></p>
<p>Pound!<br>
with the willow<br>
from the dazzling,<br>
bulkynose bay<br>
through the smoke,<br>
on the gibs<br>
serve another<br>
of them trays</p>
