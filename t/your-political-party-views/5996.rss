    <description>Post you political alignment, why you are part of that group, and discuss political issues.

I&#39;m a Conservative, radical in some ways, and very moderate or completely against in others. I think Conservatives are more realistic than Liberals or Communists/Socialists, but many Conservatives don&#39;t adhere to Separation of Church and State, and I have a problem with that.

From what I&#39;ve noticed, it seems like most of the people on this forum are leftists, so I&#39;ll be expecting a lot of Liberals here.

Explain why you support what parties you do so we can try to better understand each others&#39; views.</description>

            <p>My political view is cynicism.<br>
The Labour/Green federal gouvernment made mistakes out of misguided idealism some years back.<br>
The big coalition of Labour/Conservatives made mistakes because they were a coalition from the opposite ends and couldn’t get shit done.<br>
The current Labour/LibDem gouvernment are fucking shit up because they, well, are bickering and shamelessly backstabbing each other.</p>
<p>In my home state, the Greens came up as the strongest party in the last elections and are now the senior partner in a coalition with Labour. They wanted to abolish tuition fees and stop a huge infra-structure-project of which the costs are spiralling out of control and which the tax-payers will have to pay for in the end. But they, too, are succumbing to the neccessities of realpolitik.</p>

            <p>I would say that a decent number of Americans are not too fond of Muslims. Some, in fact, hate them. However, this doesn’t apply to everyone. Despite popular belief, not everyone in America is that ignorant. Our ignorance, even the slightest, <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> very loud, however.</p>
<p>Now, my political views. I don’t know. One person says the Dems are fucking the nation while an other will say the Reps are fucking it. Both are probably true, though…</p>
<p>I want things to go back to the way they use to be: small government, gold standard, etc.</p>

            <p>The human race started with “small governments”.  Tribespeople with leaders telling what the tribe are going to to do, where they’re going to go, and such like that.</p>
<p>Even the “nuclear family” is a “government” of sorts.  You have persons in authority (parents) and you have those that are ruled (children).</p>

            <p>I’m sticking to modern liberalism for the moment. I had been a full libertarian for a while, however, I saw in terms of the lax economic regulations how spamtarded it <span class="bbcode-i">could </span>be, i.e. multinational megacorporations in ur country stealin ur jobs/money/self-respect.</p>
<p>Modern liberalism mixes libertarian social policy with left-wing economic policies (social welfare, minimum wages, etc). Given most of the main political parties in the UK are <span class="bbcode-i">exactly the fucking same</span> however, I’m not certain I’ll be voting in the next general election. Certainly won’t be voting Lib Dem again.</p>
