    <title>What do you drive?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-do-you-drive/9448</link>
    <description>I don´t actually remember if there was a thread about this before the wipe but figured it´s a decent idea.

So I drive an 07 Abarth Stilo

<p>See I really like how this car looks, and I find it weird hearing how people dislike its aesthetics, because its styling is rather reminiscent of Lamborghini’s cars, some of the most desirable cars in the world.</p>

<p>Not an exact match obviously, but it shares some of that angularity. Of course, for example, I’m often baffled by what the Top Gear guys think are beautiful cars, like the Huayra, which just looks like a goofy smiling bug to me.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>I guess I like my cars to be distinctly machine, looking less graceful and more hard-edged and futuristic.</p>
<p>Also I’m glad I’m not alone in my outlook on driving.</p>

            <p>I own an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and it a a fantastic car. Not exactly sexy looking, but it runs great, feels great, and the AC is amazing. I think that’s all that matters. Well, except I’m gonna update the console a wee bit (cassette player is a little…dated to be useful)</p>

<p>That looks kind of like my old 87 Nissan Pulsar (same model different name for a different market/year?)<br>

<p>Hey, I had an '86 Pulsar, once.  Previous generation to yours.</p>
<p>And yeah, my car is basically from the same market niche the Pulsar once occupied for Nissan.  In the '80s in the USA, Nissan’s small FWD sports coupe was the Pulsar.  Then it became the <a href="https://thegarageblog.com/garage/wp-content/uploads/nx2000.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">NX</a> in the early 90s, and then the 200SX in the later 90s.  Incidentally, in the 1980s, Nissan’s cheap RWD coupe was called the 200SX as well.</p>
<p>Took some daylight pictures:</p>

<p>You know, IMO it’s a sort of “double” engine: its consumption and performance really depends on your the way you are driving at any given moment.<br>
If you are calm and smooth, it will consume as a “real” 1.4, and that’s good for city use, or peaceful touring. But if you want more power, if you want a moment of adrenaline, just hitting the accelerator will take you there in a second (despite being such a “small” engine): the price to pay is, of course, a <span class="bbcode-i">much </span>higher fuel consumption, but just for that moment.<br>
It can be economic, but it can also give you some true moments of fun, all with same engine under the hood. It’s very versatile.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The only drawback, as I said, is for long-distance travels… only 5 gears means that a 130 km/h you are at 3200 rpm… after a couple of hours you’ll see the fuel tank rapidly draining… why didn’t they put a 6th gear for cruising!? :meh:</p>
<p>As for the reliability, I still have my fingers crossed… this engine (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiair" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Multiair</a>) came out in 2009, when I bought it, and has never been tested in mass-production before… and I perfectly knew it, but it was too fun… I’m at 48000 km now, I hope nothing serious happens…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<hr>
<p>On a side note, would you guys kindly help me with a doubt I had for some years?</p>
<p>Before buying the MiTo, I used to drive this: a 1992 Ford Orion Ghia SI, 1.8, 130 hp, unleaded. It looked exactly like the one in the image.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Since here in Italy was super-rare (in all these years I have seen it no more than 7-8 on the roads), I have always wondered: despite being Ford a common brand, was this specific model, the Orion, “rare” worldwide or just in my country? Have you ever seen it on the streets of your cities?</p>
<p>[BTW, I LOVED that car.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  ]</p>

<p>The Bravo comes with the 6 speed option (my sister´s has it), they provably added this precisely for that reason.</p>
<p>Also I hadn´t though about it that, you make an excellent point about 2 motors in one : )</p>
<p>Also, as a kid, my parents had a ford Orion, I remember it being incredibly unreliable though, they only had it for a couple of years as a family car (we also had a renault 5 at the time but it was mostly my mothers car as before the orion we had a mercedes that got stolen), when they got rid of the Orion (1996) they bought a Mitsubishi Montero (also known as “Shogun” or “Pajero” depending of the country, they changed the name from Pajero to Montero in Spain mainly because well… pajero means more or less “wanker” lol) and it´s stayed in the family ever since, it´s 16 years old now and has never broken down O.o)</p>

2,3l turbo charged engine @ 225hk original.</p>

Here’s an example of one (not mine):</p>
