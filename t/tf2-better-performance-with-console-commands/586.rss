    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tf2-better-performance-with-console-commands/586</link>
    <description>Hey dudes...
My TF2 laggs when e.g. a pyro burns me or when much effects like explosions are on one place...
you guys know some console commands to improve the games performance?
And I don&#39;t mean &quot;Set launch options -dxlevel 80&quot;... with &lt;-- this settings TF2 loos like s**t... I just want to lower some of the effects...</description>

            <p>From memory, I’ve got the texture detail maxed, but don’t have the AA at max because at that resolution on a 23 inch monitor I don’t need it. It’s about halfway up, either 4x or 8x I think?</p>

            <p>Just to throw my own 2 cents in for the OP’s problems - I have a slightly faster Athlon X2 4400+ than he, and when I had an X1950 and then later a 8800GTS I could run TF2 very well at high detail in 1680 * 1050 with no issues. Now I’ve got a HD4850 in there and I can max the details on 1920 * 1080 (on my new monitor) with even better performance, still with the Athlon X2. The difference is I have 2GB of RAM, so based purely on my own experience I’d tell him that another gigabyte of RAM is the easiest and most cost-effective way he could improve his performance, if he decides to do that rather than play with tweaked down settings.</p>

            <p>I’m going to enable that little addition to add that little bit of detail.<br>
It’s like no work, and a nice (while very subtle) graphical increase. My GTX 260s, should handle it just fine. So should the 4870, and hell the 8800GTS 512 should as well.</p>

These sort of claims bother me, when clearly it’s not that ‘optimized’</p>

            <p>Multithreaded programming is damned difficult - making effective use of multiple cores is not a simple case of setting a compiler flag. You have to have a pretty good bit of 3D software to be able to make full use of a multi-core CPU. Like, say, my final-year project  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

</aside>
<p>That doesn’t look like half working to me, that looks like it’s just plain working. Lots of games that report they utilize extra cores aren’t even able to achieve 65 or 70 percent usage on the secondary core(s). That’s 85% total usage of your dual core processor there. That’s using it up pretty damned good I’d say.</p>

            <p>It’s your video card you should be posting, not your CPU. It’s pretty normal for a game to chew up a lot of your CPU usage.<br>
You shouldn’t be changing that setting unless you have high quality settings on already, and you’re getting 90+ fps, or else you might get stuttering in high action places.</p>

Adding it to the autoexec.cfg is easy though.</p>

            <p>It’s really only noticeable on small props and decals.<br>
FYI, the game defaults it back to -1 on startup so you’ll have to add mat_picmip -10 to the autoexec.cfg, unless you’re content with typing it in every time :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>Depends on your hardware. Mine took about a 5-10 fps hit.</p>
<p>Also, good to hear it works, I tried it with mine, but the screenshots didn’t have any noticeable difference. I’ll keep trying it out.</p>
<p>Hmm, I always thought it was 10 for some reason.</p>

            <p>Gave me about a 5 to 2 fps drop in that room, but obviously could have greater effects in areas of high ‘performance saving’ textures. Shouldn’t be enough to get your panties in a twist if you’re running it at over 100 without it set at -10.</p>
<p>Just found out the max value is actually 4.<br>
“mat_picmip” = “-1” ( def. “0” ) min. -10.000000 max. 4.000000</p>

            <p>Okay gotcha.<br>
I was wondering if you were using medium, low or high and then also adjusting the mat_picmip. So all three are on the highest setting. How much of an FPS effect does it have?</p>

            <p>I’m not quite sure what you’re saying… Every one of those pictures is taken using the highest settings the options menu has to offer, but with varying degrees of mat_picmip. The default setting for Team Fortress 2 is mat_picmip -1, but jacking it up to mat_picmip -10 yields sharper textures in places where textures are intentionally blurred to help performance.</p>

            <p>Ya but if it does the exact same thing as setting the highest levels in the options menu, then what is the point?</p>

            <p>All at the same settings, but the first with the command mat_picmip 10; the second mat_picmip -1; and the third mat_picmip -10. I just used Low, Standard and High to describe the result of the command somewhat.</p>

            <p>Okay I do see the difference in those shots. But the second one was with the highest settings possible in the actual menu, and the last one is with this tweak enabled?</p>
<p>I wish I could test myself to see.</p>
