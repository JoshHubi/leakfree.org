2.The light of the beam appears in the wrong time before the final grand portal turns on, this happened when i died here and load the former game.

3.Some textures is too dark in the chapter Blast Pit, just like this blow. The other two floors have this issues, too.

4.Purple/black on the ceiling of the final grand portal in Lambda Core. This issue was long before the Steam version came out, I remembered it already existed in the MOD version.

I have validated my game files and I thought it wasn&#39;t my own problem.
I&#39;m sorry for my bad English and bad description, self-confirmation in the game is the best way for you developers!
Thanks a lot!</description>

<p>Thanks very much for replying to this thread and your hard work.The crossbow is using different textures for SP/MP, now I have get to know this.</p>
<p>But there is still a question:<br>
I’ve found that when you shoot with right mouse button in the sniper-sight of crossbow, then take a look to the arrows left in the surrounding, the arrows are still the same as SP’s, will this be changed?</p>

<p>Most probably. Guess they forgot to add these models for MP. There was (or still is?) something similar with the .357, the ejected shells are/were golden while the ones in the gun are/were silver.</p>

</aside>
<p>The crossbow in multiplayer uses a different bolt model/ammunition, I think that’s what you pointed there and assumed it’s an issue, but isn’t.</p>
<p>That Blast Pit vents issue was reported a couple of times since CU2.</p>
<p>As about the Lambda Core issues, I can confirm that too.</p>
<p>There were even more issues in LC since the game’s release, as several other people have reported (see this for an example: <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28183-Some-lighting-issues-missing-textures-in-the-Lambda-teleporter/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Some lighting issues/missing textures in the Lambda teleporter</a> ).</p>
<p>Some seem to have been fixed, at least that’s what I think. Worth mentioning though.</p>
