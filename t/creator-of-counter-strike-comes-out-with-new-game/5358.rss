Called Tactical Intervention. Looks crappy tbh. A really cheap knock off from a game he created, supposedly. Still in Closed Beta, and I highly doubt this is going to get any popularity.</description>

<p>While I don’t completely agree that CSS is a valid successor to cs, that wasn’t my main point with the rather vague question.</p>
<p>The game does clearly look like a sequel to cs, no matter what you call it. Giving it a different name - a pretty stupid one at that - just reduces its chances to become popular enough. It doesn’t have to be called CS2, could get a creative sub-name while still retaining the Counter Strike logo. I’m sure the creators could arrange the legal issues with Valve and get to an agreement. But as it currently is - even tough the game may be promising - It’s pretty much bound to fail.</p>

Also if Valve changes even the smallest bit about CSS/1.6 the cries and screams of all the 12 year olds shatter continents. Think about the last “big” CSS update with stats and all that for example. The bitching never stops. NEVAAARGH!!!:fffuuu::fffuuu:</p>

            <p>Looks extremely crappy to me. Random people running around on a basic map and you have to shoot them. How original. Choppy animation, not realistic. Maybe 10 years ago this would have been an average game, but today, no freaking way. What is this compared to something like Half-Life? Even if it’s 11 years old.</p>

            <p>Because Valve owns CS. It’s a spiritual sucessor, but Gooseman can’t call it that because the IP now belongs to Valve.<br>
And I dunno, I want it. If it’s CS:S with better maps, more tactics involved (so you don’t kill civilians by mistake) and less 13 year-olds using nothing but AWPs and Deagles and calling everyone ‘fags’, it sounds great to me.</p>

<p>How are civilians and dogs “minor” changes from CS’s empty maps?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True that is a decent change, I just don’t see this as that promising a game.  Like someone said its what they wanted to do to CS but the players didn’t want change.  So if this is CS but upgraded, but CS players don’t want the upgrade, who wants this game?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Although its true its not a “rip off” but it really doesn’t distinguish itself from CS.  In spite of the fact that its one or a couple of the dudes who made CS, its really only some developers wanting to make a buck off of the press from that.  Its just going to be CS with a few minor changes to avoid being a blatant clone.</p>

            <p>Counter Strike : Source is not a bad game persay. Its just the morons and children who play it that make it bad. And if you ever leave the game for a month, you suck again.</p>

            <p>Another shitty F2P FPS from Korea except this time they have an excuse to put Conter Strike somewhere in the description.</p>
<p>Edit: At least it isn’t as bad a rip off of CS as this game <a href="https://crossfire.z8games.com/index2.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://crossfire.z8games.com/index2.aspx</a></p>
