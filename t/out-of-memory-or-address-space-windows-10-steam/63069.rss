    <title>Out of memory or address space. [windows 10, steam]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/out-of-memory-or-address-space-windows-10-steam/63069</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a windows 10 PC, I have a 4k Benq 60fps monitor, a GTX 1080 with 8gb of video RAM, a Ryzen 9 3900X, 64GB of 3000mhz Corsair Vengeance RAM and a 2TB samsung SSD to store it all.

I have no idea how 64gb of RAM and a GTX 1080 is not enough. I have tried several tricks already, like reinstalling the game, adding &quot;-window -noborder&quot;, disabling steam overlay, and yet every time I boot it crashes after a few seconds of loading screen.

I bought the game several years ago and this is the first time I&#39;ve had this problem (I hadn&#39;t launched since last year, but I was excited to play the new Xen levels until this happened)</description>
