    <title>Out of Meomory Error... (Nokia 5310 Xpress Music)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/out-of-meomory-error-nokia-5310-xpress-music/3020</link>
    <description>Hi there, so my problem is :

Each time I try to run a Java application, that is larger than 450kb,  on my Nokia 5310 Xpress Music, I get an error (after some time or right at the start) : &quot;Out of Memory Error java/lang/OutOfMemoryError&quot;

I searched on the interwebz and found out, that It can not run applications larger than 450kb. I don&#39;t want to accept this, so I&#39;d like to ask, if you know a solution (a firmware or something) to raise this memory so I can run these stuff.

Please spare me of the &quot;Buy a new mobile phone&quot;, thank you!

Edit: I got a 4GB memory card in it and theres 1,4GB free space left and even the phone memory has 17mb left. I don&#39;t want to run huge applications, just a maximum size of 1mb nothing more..</description>

<p>Nope, Since the problem is not coming due to the phone memory it is coming due to the heap size of the device. I’m asking if there’s a way to increase that heap memory…<br>
If I try to google “increase phone heap memory” there’s only stuff for the PC version of this problem, not the mobile phone.</p>
<p>^ Yes pfannkuchen_gesicht, I was going to write that, but you were faster  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>it has nothing to do with you memorycard or whatever, it’s more like a problem of the RAM of your phone or the cache which is available for java apps</p>

            <p>Well unless you can extend your phone’s memory by using an SD(HD) card or something like that, I’m afraid you’re stuck with whatever memory your phone has.</p>
<p>EDIT: I just checked on the Nokia website and apparently your phone has about 30MB memory and can use up to 4GB with a MicroSD card. Obviously part of this is reserved for the OS and basic programmes, but I find it hard to believe that this would leave you with less than half a MB.</p>
<p>But looking on the interwebz, it would appear this has nothing to do with the physical memory but your phone simply can’t play java games with a heap size over approximately 400-500kB.</p>
