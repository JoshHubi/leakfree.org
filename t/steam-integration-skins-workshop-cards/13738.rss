    <description>Hi
I want to know if Black mesa will use functions of Steam.
-Skins and items
Like CS:GO or TF2 has . I am sure you know what am i talking about
-Workshop
BMS could use workshop for maps (and other stuff) . It would be nice to create map in bms sdk and publish it in workshop
-Cards
I am also sure that you know what i mean

It can all look somehow like on this quickly made picture [url]https://www.jpeg.cz/images/2015/03/25/Jg1tR.png[/url]</description>

<p>Workshop has been confirmed by the devs to be included on release of the steam version.  It’s safe to assume cards, badges, and achievements are included as well (extra revenue + longevity, and achievements are already in the mod version, just not integrated with steam).  It is unknown if BM will have a skin system like CSGO on launch, but probably not, because the devs have enough on their plate as it is.  But they will be updating the game (especially multiplayer) after the release, so an item system is not out of the question.  I wouldn’t expect any new stats like tf2, just possibly skins for the current weapons (If we’re lucky).  But you can mod the game yourself to make a skin for your gun, or get one off the workshop.  Problem is, that won’t show on the other people’s end (Similarly to L4D2’s system atm:  different viewmodels clientside, same stats all around)</p>
