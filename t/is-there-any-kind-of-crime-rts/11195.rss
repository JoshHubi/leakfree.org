    <title>Is there any kind of crime RTS?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-there-any-kind-of-crime-rts/11195</link>
    <description>When I was a kid I used to play one game, that was some kind of RTS where you managed your own mafia in Chicago in the 1920s. But after that, I&#39;ve never seen one like that again. I think there must be some new games like this one. Maybe not about the mafia, but about gangs, drug dealers, I don&#39;t know. It could even be from the police point of view. I think it would be really really nice. I just don&#39;t understand why nobody has had the idea before. I mean, imagine planning a hit, laundering money, bribing the cops, killing witnesses, or evading a police raid, it would be great! But... There are no games like this. Or may be I&#39;m wrong, you tell me.</description>

<p>Heh, but in my experience it was “<span class="bbcode-i">something to read around the tree</span>” since it’s rude to leave the family to install computer games on xmas.</p>
<p>Or “<span class="bbcode-i">something to read before bed</span>” since it’s rude to occupy the family computer any longer than 2 hours a day.</p>

            <p>God I love manuals. They give you something to read on the way home from the store, you know?<br>
Plus the basic story, weapons list, in-universe stuff…<br>
Okay, if I ever end up making a commercial game, it will have a PDF manual. And a print one on any retail copies.</p>

<p>Shit I think I still have a boxed copy of this game laying somewhere. Got it in a package with Might and Magic VI and Riverworld.</p>
<p>[i]edit: Couldn’t find MM6 but I know I got it somewhere. I also found a couple of goodies while I was at it:<br>
<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22875505/WP_000579.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>And you know, it kind of made me sad to think that boxes like these, with 200-pages manuals, big-ass maps and stuff, they don’t make these anymore. I still have the manual for Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri (Civilization set in space) that contained more info than a real encyclopedia; stuff that doesn’t even matter to gameplay like Alpha Centauri’s geological composition and gravitational pull versus Earth’s. Now you don’t have anything of this. You get the game online and you’re lucky to get a pdf version of the key sheet.[/i]</p>
