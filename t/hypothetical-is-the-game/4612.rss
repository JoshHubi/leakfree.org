    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hypothetical-is-the-game/4612</link>
    <description>The game is simple: present a hypothetical situation and the next poster has to give an answer to what he would do, and present a new hypothetical situation.

situation: offered a super power of your choice in exchange for a body part of your choice, what would you do? (I&#39;m sure you will think of better ones)</description>

            <p>definately. even if there wasn’t air in the tires, i’d pump them up only to get as far as possible from this boring place. unfortunately my bike has more problems than the lack of air in it’s tires…</p>
<p>if you found a bag with three cute little kittens starving on the side of the road what would you do?</p>
<p>-kick them to the middle of the road<br>
-take them and feed them to a mad dog<br>
-take them home, give them a shitload of fish and then cuddle with them when you go to bed</p>

That scene would be followed up at age 21 in some slow story of tragedy with some focus on that January. And conclude the film once I die or marry, to make it seem conclusive.</p>
