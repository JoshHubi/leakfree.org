    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/if-you-could-choose-one-game-to-be-instantly-released/5149</link>
    <description>If you ever a had an option to instantly release ONE game, what would it be?

I woulda taken Hl2 ep3, Portal 2 or Bioshock infinite, hard to decide.

And of cource the game is completed and not a half made game.</description>
