    <description>I saw this video today... and although the visuals are not a scratch on the pc version of half life or black mesa I found a part of it really quite scary.

see below

basically it&#39;s the scene of the doors opening and an alien grunt being right behind the doors... That image has burned itself into my brain and I would love to see that in an update of black mesa.

It would be nice to give the alien grunt a bit of limelight like this at some point

What do you think?</description>

            <p>It’s as you get into the Lambda core, after you’ve gone down the main elevator and killed the black ops in the cargo area. After that you get to the main blast doors and this happens, loads of them everywhere. Then you meet the scientist after he opens the doors for you, the guy who picks the ‘short straw’.</p>
<p>Fuck I could walk you through every game without even looking, how sad!</p>
<p>But yeah, made me shit masonry when I first played it as a kid.</p>

            <p>There was one of them “prying open a large set of heavy blast doors”, if I remember right…</p>
<p>Should be in the map ‘<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c3a1b</span>’ - correct me if I’m wrong.</p>
<p>I’d make a video about, if you wanted me to.</p>
<p>… or you could look at it yourself - should be about half-way through (behind one of the blast doors) …[/SIZE]</p>

            <p>really I don’t remeber that… I think it is a bit disturbing</p>
<p>wiki says this so you are right</p>
<p>“They also demonstrate superhuman strength in various scripted sequences seen throughout the game; such as punching a HECU Marine through a concrete wall, or quickly prying opening a large set of heavy blast doors.”</p>
<p>Alien grunts really had none of this shame that</p>

            <p>That was in the PC version, too, if I remember correctly. I actually was surprised when it never happened, but I guess everyone’s expecting it if they’ve played Half-Life a lot.</p>
