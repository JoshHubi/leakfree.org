    <description>Looks phenomenal and surprisingly fun, it runs on Source :|
Also interestingly, one of the devs also worked on Black Mesa? [url]https://www.linkedin.com/title/game-designer/at-respawn-entertainment[/url] unless I misunderstand it.</description>

            <p>Yeah, it’s definitely a good decision.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’ve since uninstalled Titanfall because my HDD was almost full and there’s really no way to justify dedicating like 70 gigs to a game I barely play.</p>

            <p>Titanfall season pass is now free for anyone who still plays this gem of a game. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/all-titanfall-map-packs-are-now-free-on-origin/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.pcgamer.com/all-titanfall-map-packs-are-now-free-on-origin/</a></p>
<p>As someone who paid for the 100$ season pass I can say I’m happy they did this. The current model of paid map pack DLC divides the player base and in the end the newer maps rarely get played. Hopefully this brings in more players.</p>

            <p>I’m happy that this game is relatively successful, there’s a lot to look up to with Titanfall 2, although I’m not sure how will it compete against Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, since they seem to have pretty much copied Titanfall with an added spit to it.</p>

            <p>I haven’t been able to lay on any of them without lag yet, but what I can say for sure is that they’re visually bland. The maps in Frontier’s Edge (and probably Expedition, though I’ve hardly touched those) all look utterly gorgeous, but the maps in IMCR are fairly dull. Facility 18 is an ugly blob of concrete and crap, with no visually redeeming characteristics at all. Sandtraps has some neat pipes and stuff, but there’s more concrete than actual sand, and the skybox is just unsuitable cut-and-paste job. Backwater is pretty nice-looking, though. I like the train tracks.</p>
<p>The SP is a reasonably balanced weapon that’s extremely frustrating to get killed by.</p>

            <p>IMC Rising is out. I’d say this is probably the weakest of the three map packs, but I haven’t had a lot of time on them yet. What do you all think?</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpilyEMt6YM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this is a compelling video breaking down the Smart Pistol and perceptions on it being overpowered.</a> I’d be in favor of a change like that, even though I use the Smart Pistol fairly often myself.</p>

            <p>Attention all Titanfall players: <a href="https://www.titanfall.com/news/ctf-matchmaking-update-pc-and-xbox-one" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">CTF lobbies are back!</a> Also, there’s a mild implementation of auto-team balance, which should help even games out more.</p>
<p>I think their argument against server browsers is fucking stupid, though. “Scroll through thousands of servers to find one with an open slot?” No, that’s what filters are for. You give us a filter, that lets us find specific games- sort by game type, by server location, by rank/ELO whatever is judging us in the background. Sure, it’s what your matchmaking tool must do in the backgroud- but this way WE HAVE A CHOICE.</p>

            <p>Eh, I dunno. Maybe I’m just a bit of a zealot when it comes to MP game balance. To me, it’s a pretty major change, because the game is already balanced like a throwing knife. I’ve had a lot of really damn close CTF matches, and it was generally when one team or the other wasn’t coordinating via voice chat that caused matches to massively go one way or the other. So, in my admittedly subjective experience, CTF balancing was already very well done.</p>
<p>Also, there aren’t any more CTF only lobbies or Pilot Hunter lobbies- it got rolled into Variety pack. Granted, this is probably because it was impossible to get a team going on those maps, because most of the public was busy playing Variety Pack or Attrition. I just really wish the game had a server browser so I could get into CTF games more instead of having to wait for Variety Pack to cycle to one.</p>

            <p>It always pissed me off that people carried flags in titans personally. I’m glad they removed that ability, I think it gave people a rather unfair advantage in CTF and made it far too easy to just waltz into the enemy base in a titan, grab the flag and gtfo. There should be more tactics involved and I think that adds to it. That way the titans can fulfill a more guardian role in CTF maps while the pilots do the capturing. It makes sense to me since the pilots are faster.</p>

            <p>What really pissed me off about the update was not being able to flag carry in a Titan anymore. Makes Titans pretty much useless in CTF and makes the mode boring and frustrating to play, rather than using the Titan as a tradeoff option between speed and firepower to carry the flag.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anyone cares, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/k3nny1550/b/529448269" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">I played the map pack for a couple hours and ranted about the CTF balance here.</a></p>

            <p>In my experience, playing as a titan didn’t seem compelling because you would get targeted at shot down so quickly. This is obviously necessary for balance, but it means the fun lost from losing mobility is not regained with the fun of being a force of nature, because the titans are actually pretty weak. I actually agree with ODB for once, the Titans are just bigger slower infantry. Balance wise it works great, funwise, for me, it just really doesn’t cut it. So I found myself just completely ignoring my titan and running around. Which was fun, but shallow. Perhaps even more shallow than CoD because it’s missing the killstreak rewards to compensate the player for picking up kills and not dying. Dying and kills don’t feel like enough of penalties or rewards. In addition the level design we’ve seen so far and the nature of the extreme mobility in large maps dulls the effect of the level design on gameplay. Unlike CoD  (which also has this problem, just not as much, CS:GO is a better example) each map feels pretty much the same as the last. While the paths are cool, there’s a million of them in one map and none of them feel very unique and are generally pretty obvious.</p>
<p>On top of all of this, the NPC infantry feels completely superfluous. They just make it harder to distinguish actual threats (human players) from useless inconsequential bots. Some idiot on IGN or something compared the NPCs to waves in a MOBA. But in a MOBA, the NPCs are actually relevant. You need to kill them to build your character up through RPG style elements, and they’re strategically necessary to take a position or objective. Not to mention they can actually do significant damage to you and kill you if you draw their attention (at least early to mid game). If they could actually add these elements to Titanfall in one way or another, it could be REALLY REALLY cool. Imagine if (sorta like in a MOBA) only the stock weapons were available to you at the beginning of a round, and more much stronger weapons became available to you as you got points. Each round would then have an actual progression to it with the battle escalating as you get closer to the end of the match. Dying and killing would actually matter because they’d be directly tied to your upgrades and the NPCs would actually play a relevant role (and could be buffed to do more damage). But as is, the NPCs are nothing but distracting set pieces to make the maps feel less empty than they are.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Tl;Dr/my subjective conclusion:</span><br>
The game is well made with impressive balancing, and the infantry is fun, but the titans are boring and the infantry mode is too shallow to hold up on its own. My opinion could completely change if the content in the full game not found in the beta adds a lot of depth to the game, but I’m skeptical at the moment. The game has a lot more potential but the underlying mechanics are too conventional. Hopefully the mysterious campaign multiplayer gives what the beta is missing.</p>

            <p>I honestly think they did a really good job with the interplay between titans and pilots. The titan’s more restricted mobility and heavier weaponry (and the abilities like the shield that can throw back projectiles) makes it feel like more than just a bigger player and their higher survivability helps with the whole “tactics over reflexes” thing they seem to have going on with the titans since you can actually take out multiple enemy titans if you are smart about how you play (whereas pilots are still the more standard who shoots first, though the wall running and jumping certainly makes it a little more skill-based)</p>
<p>The wall running IMO does make it like tribes since every successful wallrun you gain speed so (especially in CTF) you can discover routes for flag capping that can make you go insanely fast if you can manage to not fuck your movement up.</p>

            <p>Defs not Quake lmao. And tbh, on second thought, it is more COD with boosters rather than tribes.</p>
