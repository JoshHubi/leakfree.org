    <description>[url=&#39;https://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=ops3+mouse+controller&amp;cid=3147666178784916261&amp;ei=W_6MTOvTIZ3SiwT9x41s&amp;sa=title&amp;ved=0CAcQ8wIwADgA#p&#39;]ps3 mouse controller[/url]

Nearly every review claims using this mouse has greatly improved their accuracy and the only negative reviews are saying this mouse doesn&#39;t live up to it&#39;s pc counter-part. And for all the xbox fanboys, besides the ps3 controller being more uncomfortable, the two are practically identical, so this applies to you too.</description>

<p>I played TFC using a Kensington Orbit trackball, for over two years (back in the days when things had serial-connectors). It was inferior to the mouse, sure, but it was playable enough that I continued using it because it was there (and didn’t go out of my way to get a mouse).</p>

            <p>Also, I played UT 3 on my PS3 with a controller a couple years ago and guess what?<br>
The combat is much more engaging, fun, random and keeping your heartbeat on the edge - and guess what the reasons are? Because it’s impossible to be 100% accurate.</p>
<p>You heard me. You cannot rely on your pro-<span class="bbcode-i">gay</span>mer mouse “skills” anymore. That’s why faggots like garth whine about “shitty controllers”.<br>
Can’t have fun with it - it’s simple - you have your own pool of headshot nerds.</p>

            <p>Garthbartin, you are only seeing this from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>PC gaming and console gaming are different beasts with different standards and culture.</p>
<p>You can prove a mouse is much faster and accurate for certain games than  a console controller but the thing is that you can’t change  the fact that people will play their console games with the controller it came  with. It’s part of its nature and most people won’t have it another way.</p>
<p>When people think of console gaming, the picture that comes to mind is  of someone playing games in front of a TV sitting on a comfy couch, many  times in relaxed, laid back positions. Most of the time they just want to have a fun time without worrying too much about complex game mechanics, super fast reflexes or dead on accuracy.</p>
<p>The gamepad is ideal for that. It’s small, light, easy to use, can be used in any position and, most importantly, it’s part of the identity of console gaming.</p>
<p>Console gamers would rather have a little help aiming with controller in their fps games than sacrificing their comfort by playing with a keyboard and mouse.</p>

            <p><span class="mention">@garthbartin</span></p>
<p>Just to clarify, I was referring to desktop implementations of trackball, only noticed that … thing … in the link right after I posted.</p>
<p>The tb can be far more accurate than a mouse, exactly for the reason you mentioned. You’ll only need 1 finger, and less momentum to perform a motion with it, which results in increased precision, and smaller dependency of physical twitches leads to less stuttering.</p>
<p>The “ball” actually gives you an infinite work area, while a regular mouse is limited to your desktop/mousepad size. Proper drivers have momentum based motion acceleration, you can - with practice - master free spinning mode, and sure as hell can move a single finger in a small distance a lot faster than lift mouse+hand and move it several inches away.</p>
<p>Of course, it takes a bit more than just 5 mins to get used to it, but that’s true both ways. The only real problem with trackball is, that many of them are discontinued, and/or lack current technologies. I used them for ~10 years, both for gaming and professional design environments. Still have one for the latter purpose, but that’s just a standard industrial mouse, not an ergonomic desktop design.</p>
<p>Sure, I understand that you can’t use it as effective, as your default desktop, but that’s your problem, not the hardware, let alone the concept.</p>
<p>The gamepad/trackball on the other hand, not sure. Ergonomics seem a bit weird, but it’s still operated by thumb, thus should be competitive.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have used one. The mouse is the most accurate device because it uses your entire hand to control your aim. That way you have much higher accuracy even at high sensitivities. The trackball entirely defeats this purpose as you are back to using only your finger. And the trackball also has direct motion translation with the screen, which in this case is a bad thing as it means you either need to have extremely high sensitivity, or slide your finger over and over really fast just to make a 180 degree turn.</p>

</aside>
<p>The problems here are<br>
A) console users are ignorant fanboys who have somehow convinced themselves the controller is superior<br>
B) nobody wants to buy a special controller just to play against pc users<br>
C) people playing online with an console and regular console controller would be destroyed by all the players using the mouse controller<br>
D) and finally why does playing against xbox players really matter that much<br>
If they are going to make a  cross platform multiplayer either handicap the pc users (which would probably be really annoying), or make it for a non-fps game like Assassins Creed.</p>

</aside>
<p>Whenever I tell consolefags the controller is less accurate and can’t turn fast enough they always say “but you can change the sensitivity.” Except other than personal preference that makes no difference; turning up sensitivity allows you to turn faster but sacrifices accuracy, while turning down sensitivity increases accuracy, but greatly sacrifices turning speed.</p>
<p>And the analog stick extensions look uncomfortable as hell.</p>

            <p>I think there’s a part missing from this thread. In terms of kb+m for FPS games, it has been proven that a person playing with a PC and the kb+m combo will beat someone playing with a console and gamepad. I haven’t seen the study, but I’m told that originally XBoxes were supposed to be able to connect with PC’s and have head to head cross platform multiplayer matches. Except that the XBox user would repeatedly get mashed by the PC user, and primarily due to reaction speed based on the use of the mouse.</p>
<p>NOW, if this is correct, surely we could actually open multiplayer up across all the major platforms by providing similar controllers across them. Mouse control for FPS games on XBox, Playstation and PC. If you take away the innate benefit that a PC user gets because they are the one with the mouse, and give that to the other two systems then surely this is a good thing?</p>
<p>I don’t care if you use a console. I’m a PC gamer because I prefer that system, but I think for FPS games console gamers should also be provided with the same level of control, which could lead to wider ranging multiplayer scenarios.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p>wat.</p>
<p>Did they fuck up the M&amp;K controls or something?  I would think it would feel better with a mouse instead of a right analog stick.</p>
<p>But yeah, I agree with the general consensus of this thread.  Some games are better with a M&amp;K, others are better with a gamepad of some kind.</p>

            <p>I hate this debate.</p>
<p>The answer is so obvious.</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/175126/bodielobus-ps2-controller-with-trackball" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">You’re BOTH right</a>.  Ergonomics and precision are BOTH important.</p>
<p>That way, you would get the precision of a mouse/trackball without the baggage of a keyboard (because let’s face it, for <span class="bbcode-i">turning</span>, the precision of a mouse beats an analog stick any day, but for <span class="bbcode-i">moving around</span>, an analog stick pretty much murders a keyboard).</p>
<p>I’m a mouse+keyboard guy 99% of the time these days, (even played through Assassin’s Creed with m+kb) but if I could just get my hands on one of those for the PC, I’d love to have one. It would replace my Logitech Rumblepad 2 in a heartbeat, and might just be enough to draw me away from the mouse+keyboard crowd permanently.</p>

<p>Splinter Cell without controller<br>
:fffuuu:<br>
the mouse is far better than the controller, but the keyboard not so much for the movement. Mabye you could use two mouses! One for looking and one for movement, with LOTS of buttons on it.:retard:<br>
that actually might be kinda cool.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, I found Splinter cell to be far better with mouse and keyboard. Mouse scroll adjusted your movement speed and I much preferred that to a joystick.</p>
<p>Also, I think it’s worth noting that PC gamers have the choice to use a controller if they want to. So the argument is completely redundant really.</p>
<p>Edit: I just noticed this - proud to be an atheist<br>
If you have any questions about atheism feel free to open a Biology text book and look up “evolution” in the index.</p>
<p>Makes me happy that someone else finds that Christian sig really annoying.</p>

</aside>
<p>Keyboard is inferior when it comes to skate games and racing games. See? Not so hard. It’s simply that A) there aren’t many good racing games and skate games to miss out on, B) I can simply plug a controller into my computer if I really cared that much and finally C) m+kb still works pretty well.</p>
