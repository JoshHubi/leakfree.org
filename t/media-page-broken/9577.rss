    <title>Media Page Broken</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/media-page-broken/9577</link>
    <description>Hey, guys.

I noticed a bug with the Media page. While it works very well when visiting from [url=&#39;https://release.blackmesasource.com/&#39;]your homepage[/url] in that it is properly embedded therein, it does not have any functionality when visiting it externally.

The URL from the front page is as follows: [url]https://release.blackmesasource.com/pages/media.html[/url]

This page has no formatting to it, and the embedded images fail to load (likely due to permission errors; we aren&#39;t supposed to get there). I am sure there are many other users that like to open links in another tab or window, so it is a fairly apparent issue.

Interestingly enough, however, the Media link from [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/&#39;]your forum[/url] is [u]different[/u] than the above link from your front page: [url]https://www.blackmesasource.com/media.html[/url]

Unlike the former link, this page completely fails to load.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</description>
