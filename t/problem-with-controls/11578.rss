    <title>Problem with controls...?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-with-controls/11578</link>
    <description>So, I realized while playing that my weapons weren&#39;t doing the fast switchy thing, and I proceeded to the options to rectify this. I check the appropriate box, click ok, and click apply. Get back in the game and I&#39;m still not switching weapons all fast-like. Try again and again just to make sure I&#39;m not doing something wrong and it still doesn&#39;t work. I bring up the developer&#39;s console to see exactly what the game is doing and I realize that every time I hit apply, this pops up: 

[code]
exec: couldn&#39;t exec userconfig.cfg
Host_WriteConfiguration: Wrote cfg/config.cfg
Using joystick &#39;Xbox360 controller&#39; configuration
JOY_AXIS_X:  mapped to Side (absolute)
JOY_AXIS_Y:  mapped to Forward (absolute)
JOY_AXIS_Z:  unmapped
JOY_AXIS_R:  mapped to Look (absolute)
JOY_AXIS_U:  mapped to Turn (absolute)
JOY_AXIS_V:  unmapped
Advanced Joystick settings initialized
[/code]

So, what the eff?</description>
