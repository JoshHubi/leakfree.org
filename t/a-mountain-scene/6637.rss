<p>It seems that the displacement map goes a bit screwy at parts. I also agree with the zoom speed comments. Pretty cool though.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Thank you so much. I saw you’re Wheatley model and I was EXTREMELY impressed  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  I will work on a new version soon to post that will be more akin to the opening I want to make! And you are absolutely right about the displacement map &gt;.&gt; It was so frustrating trying to dick with that shit I just gave up.</p>

            <p>This more of an experiment just for me to see how textures look in the scene and such while it animates. In the final animation which will be an opening for my friends youtube channel I will make it much smoother.</p>

            <p>^agreed, The camera movement is rigid in some spots. Make it more smoothly and work on the zoom in and outs a bit, they arent really focusing on anything particular.</p>

            <p>first: welcome</p>
<p>uhhm first and second link are the same, i figure this is not intended?<br>
anyway it looks quite awesome.<br>
when you move over the landscape, you sometimes zoom in and out kinda abruptly. i would appreciate a little smoother moving, if you know what i mean.</p>
