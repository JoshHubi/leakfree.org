    <title>Gamecrash by flashlight</title>

    <description>I&#39;m at the very beginning of the level bm_c1a1 where you go down or up in an elevator. At first the level wouldn&#39;t load and hl2.exe would stop responding. After reloading it and pressing many buttons I turned of the flashlight and now it runs again, until I turned the flashlight on again. No idea how this happens</description>

<p>Did some more fooling around. It crashes when looking in the direction (with the flashlight on) of the elevator or just the hallway</p>
