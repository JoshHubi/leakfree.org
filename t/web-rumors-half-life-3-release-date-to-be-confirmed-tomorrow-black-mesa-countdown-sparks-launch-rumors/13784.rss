    <description>Websites Jumping to Conclusions:

From: [url]https://www.youthhealthmag.com/articles/15189/20150504/half-life-3-release-date-to-be-confirmed-tomorrow-black-mesa-countdown-sparks-launch-rumors.htm[/url]

Could tomorrow be the end of the long wait for a &quot;Half Life 3&quot; release date announcement?

A countdown timer on the Black Mesa Research Facility [url=&#39;https://www.bmrf.us/&#39;]website[/url] has been ticking over a recorded emergency broadcast message. It is not clear what the timer is for, but fans are speculating that it can either be an announcement of &quot;Black Mesa,&quot; a Source engine-based remake of the original Half-Life, or a &quot;Half Life 3&quot; release date update.

&quot;The timer leads up to May 5 at exactly 7:47 a.m. PT (8:47 a.m. in New Mexico). This date turns out to be very significant in &quot;Half Life&quot; mythology as it happens to be the same date Gordon Freeman started to work for Black Mesa,&quot; [url=&#39;https://www.christiantoday.com/article/half.life.3.happening.black.mesa.website.plasters.timer/53242.htm&#39;]Christian Today[/url] reported.

&quot;Fans have tried to mine more details from the site, hoping it could lead them to more clues about what this is all about. They tried stabilizing the video from the site and they found 8 - 13 - 8 - 16 - 13, which is based on the how the bars flash. Unfortunately, they have yet to come up with an explanation for it and all other attempts were in vain.&quot;

Valve has always been clear about the status of the highly-anticipated 3rd installment- it is not being developed as of the moment. According to a report from [url=&#39;https://motoringcrunch.com/news/half-life-3-e3-might-not-happen/10011183/&#39;]Motoring Crunch[/url], Valve co-founder Gabe Newell released a statement about the game&#39;s fate to address all rumors once and for all.

&quot;Gabe simply said that Half Life 3 is not in production at the moment and fans shouldn&#39;t expect it to come anytime soon. Of course, Gabe could either be cooling down the hype or telling the truth,&quot; the article read.

&quot;Either way, there is a positive that can be taken from Gabe&#39;s words and that is he didn&#39;t deny Half Life 3&#39;s coming at all. No matter how the outcome of E3 will be like, Half Life 3&#39;s coming remain to be inevitable.&quot;

Despite Gabe Newell directly saying that a Half Life 3 release date is not in any way confirmed, fans still continue to speculate on the fate of the highly awaited third installment.

Do you think the new teaser on the &quot;Black Mesa&quot; website will be a &quot;Half Life 3&quot; release date announcement?

[b]Black Mesa Steam Workshop page appears[/size][/b]

Less than 24 hours remain on the [url=&#39;https://www.pcgamer.com/mysterious-countdown-clock-appears-for-black-mesa/&#39;]countdown[/url] clock at the Black Mesa Research Facility[url=&#39;https://www.bmrf.us/&#39;]website[/url], which has switched to a new and rather alarming emergency broadcast. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s actually the same message the site began to broadcast [url=&#39;https://www.pcgamer.com/black-mesa-source-affiliated-website-initiates-emergency-broadcast-teaser/&#39;]over the new year[/url], although some details may have changed. Either way, it&#39;s a chilling (and exciting!) notification that something has gone very wrong at Black Mesa.


The teaser website is fun, but practically speaking it&#39;s the appearance of the [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com//workshop/browse/?appid=362890&#39;]Black Mesa Workshop[/url] on Steam that points to all of this hype being somehow related to [url=&#39;https://www.pcgamer.com/black-mesa-source-finally-released-download-it-now/&#39;]Black Mesa[/url], the Source engine-based remake of the original Half-Life. It could be that the Xen levels, which aren&#39;t currently part of Black Mesa, are ready for release, or it could signal the long-awaited launch of the [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/17088-Happy-Birthday-Half-life/?&#39;]retail version[/url] of the game on Steam.

The Workshop contains seven maps, all for multiplayer battles, as well as an eighth, entitled, &quot;asdf0,&quot; which as we all know is computer-speak for, &quot;This is a test.&quot; There&#39;s no store page link, however, and the home and discussion links lead to either the Steam storefront or the Steam Workshop front pages; trying to &quot;manually&quot; reach a Black Mesa store page by using the app ID number from the Workshop page in a regular Steam URL is also a bust.

Despite the near-certitude that this is all tied into Black Mesa, more resolutely optimistic fans may still maintain hope that it&#39;s all a lead-up to the announcement of Half-Life 3. Buried in the code of the BMRF.us website is an ascii image of the mysterious G-Man, above a link to &quot;THREE.WebGLRenderer.&quot; It&#39;s not exactly &quot;confirmed!&quot; but dare to dream, right?

Whatever it is, the countdown clock will hit zero at 9:47 Mountain Standard Time on May 5. Be ready.</description>
