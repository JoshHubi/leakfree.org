    <title>A little audio help ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-little-audio-help/1464</link>
    <description>Alright I need some audio expertise its not somthing I really know about. I recently blew my P.C speakers, and I have a unsed T.V surround system 5.1 and I was wondering if it is possible to use that with my computer.

Im not sure it is but if anyone could let me know for sure I would mightly appreciate it.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Collision I’ve already answerd that question in post 13* of this thread. Enjoy the tale of woe and stupidity.</p>
<p>Tried the cable today, 2.1ch sound works on all 4 working speakers. Tried the diffrent parts of the 5.1 they all seem to work. Apart from the central speaker Im thinking its proberly been broken in storage, tried a diffrent line/conection and no joy.</p>
<p>Still 4.1 sound is still better than my stand-in speakers, and there even better than the speakers they were replacing. I’ll get the last two cables now that I Know the’ll work 2mrw.</p>
<p>And i’ll leave one more post tomorrow with the results.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em></p>
<p>I have bought the aditional cables and now its all working perfectly, I am very happy with the set up at least this way I can give black mesa the sound it deserves when it comes out.</p>
<p>It like to say thank you to everyone who gave me advice. I do apreciate it allot.</p>

            <p>Well To be honest blows proberly the wrong term (I just wanted to sound cool  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  ) they finally died after I put them through some seriouse abuse,  Played allot louder than I really should of. stretched them a Bit too often, they stopped after a heavy session of drum and bass, heavy metal and a small drop to the floor.<br>
I  also think this song didnt help  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq5GdutCRo8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq5GdutCRo8</a> dub step not speaker freindly.</p>
<p>But I got my moneys worth they lasted a good three years of Gaming and student partys. So no regrets.</p>
<p>Well apart from the fact im now using 10yr old pc speakers with no sub, I think you can guess how bad they sound.</p>
<p>and pfannkuchen_ges yes that thought did occur to me a while after you sugested the spliter, but even if I did that im not sure it would work as I read that Computers apart from when playing films use a diffrent kind of 5.1 sound that Tvs use (not dolby/dts). Sounds a bit odd to me that they would be that difrent but, I think i’ll try with the one cable splitter and test the  pairs of speakers individualy before I invest in more of them cause there not that cheap. but cheers for the idea.</p>

            <p>Good idea to check, but there just the standard clips for speaker wire. Daft question do you reckon it would be possible to wire standered stero wire into a 3.1 jack and connect the diffrent speakers directly up to a sound card? it is a 5.1 sound card.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> yer pretty sure you cant,</p>

            <p>Check the audio in ports on your speakers, if you’re lucky they’ll have more then just the red and white holes.</p>

            <p>Yes, find the audio in ports, most likely a red and blue circle, and you can get a cable that leads from your computer to there.</p>
<p>I don’t know about getting it surround sound, but it’s a start.</p>
