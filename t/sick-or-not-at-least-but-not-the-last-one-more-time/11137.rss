    <description>About to play-to-finish the mod [b]for the 3rd time ;-I[/b] There&#39;s something that makes me coming back, likely cause I want more Half-Life  :smiley: 

Spoiler: [COLOR=&#39;Black&#39;]another reason could be the epic and brilliant soundtrack, the credits song is very emotional, I cry cause I want more after it but there ain&#39;t no Xen coming that soon, but it&#39;s not like the tracks alone aren&#39;t the cause behind my eyes getting wet, sniff sniff.

Has anyone else played the mod more than once since release?
If you have, state your reason for doing so.

<p>That’s the problem with snarks, there’s nowhere to use them immediately and they’re so rare that you usually forget about them.</p>
<p>In HL1, that scene where the soldiers shoot up the vent was perfect, but in this game there’s the freaking Gargantua there as well. (I’m not even going to talk about how rushed that sequence was.)</p>

            <p>I restarted most of the way through due to graphic issues. I’ve gotten up to FAF so far on my second playthrough and having a blast.  Definitely going to replay again with some tweaks.  For example: spawning/arming random scientists  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>As for the snarks and trips…  Some weapons just aren’t meant to be used as much as others.  I used the trips (effectively) twice so far. Haven’t had much use for the snarks yet, besides killing myself with them for the achievement, lol…</p>

<p>Hehe, buggy bugs!<br>
I only used Snarks once … to kill myself for the achievement  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p>As for replaying, I only played it once. After that I moved on to HL Source Xen then HL2 and through the episodes (currently at the start of ep2).<br>
However, I will definitely play again. I am just refraining from replaying games right away these days since I usually end up starting them up again but not finishing them. This means you get into this cyce where you know the beginning of a game so well that it bores you before you get to the juicy partsat the end again (and I don’t like not starting at the beginning of a game I haven’t touched in a while). I think I’ll wait until Xen is out, then go for another run.</p>

            <p>1st playthrough on hard, was really fun, but also quite annoying at times (<em>cough</em>the famous osprey sequence in surface tension<em>cough</em>).<br>
2nd playthrough will follow, I plan to do on normal, messing a bit around and doing… Science ! :freeman:  no, second playthrough is mostly for the conversations etc. to check the translation of the subtitles.</p>
<p>About the Weapon things… Tripmines useless ? Are you kidding me ? I’ve recycled all my strategies from Half-Life, for example towards the end of apprehension (or later for Lambda Core): Assassins are pissing you off ? Hop over to the room with tons of crates in and tripmine the door. when the assassins will come in --&gt; instant death. Works well for HECU and Alien Grunts which will follow you, too. I looked around the corner in Power Up, the Marines saw me and ran into their death.</p>
<p>In my mind, the Snarks should’ve been placed earlier for gameplay reasons… I mean, you get them and have to run instantly from the Garg. From then, I forgot about them and you encounter not that much HECU… The other thing is… Do Snarks attack actually only Humans ? I had in my mind to use them against the Xenian Forces, but everytime i threw them, they would come back to me instead of attacking the Vorts (I don’t remember if they showed the same behavior in HL).</p>

            <p>Played through twice. The second time on hard was barely more difficult than the first playthrough on medium. Trip mines are useless imo. As someone else said, you have to retreat in order to put them to some use. But the problem is that especially soldiers shoot so accurately that you have to keep your distance to them all the time. This means that soldiers have to approach a long way to even get near the trip mine you could place without being killed. Often they simply do not reach out that far. You can build some traps with them though.</p>

            <p>You need to be nearly touching the wall in order to plant them. In HL1, Gordon’s mine-planting reach was a bit further.</p>
<p>It’s not too hard to adapt to, really. But it can get annoying when you think it’s HL1 and you can just drop a mine from 2 or 3 feet away, only to find that you didn’t actually plant it.</p>

            <p>Well on subsequent playthroughs, tripmines actually become a bit more useful because you can remember where certain enemies will spawn, so you can set traps well in advance.</p>

            <p>I’ve played the mod through several times. The first time for real, and the subsequent runs were for teh lulz, experimenting with various ways to play.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It’s actually really fun.</p>

<p>Beaten it twice so far. First time on Normal, second time on Hard getting as many of the achievements as I could. I actually found my second playthrough quite a lot easier, despite upping the difficulty.

<p>My first one was on Hard, then on Normal.<br>
This time I must agree with you, there are still things to discover even after a few playthroughs. And yes, I’m not done yet with the original… I’m gonna replay that one sometimes…</p>
<p>The thing that makes it weird about my BM experience is, that I’m yet to use the Gluon Gun as a weapon, didn’t kill a single npc with it despite beating the game twice. That makes me think the game has too much weapons, specific ones like Snarks and Tripmines are completely useless and fit only the Deathmatch, not the main game… my best friends are pretty much the Crossbow, Python and Shotgun  :-/</p>

            <p>On my first run, was on hard, was really boring as I spent the whole time reloading areas, being sneaky and using cheap tricks to get by, but I did get to look at a lot of detail cause I was taking my time. I’m playing on normal now, and can be a total bad ass</p>

            <p>About to play-to-finish the mod <span class="bbcode-b">for the 3rd time ;-I</span> There’s something that makes me coming back, likely cause I want more Half-Life  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Spoiler: [COLOR=‘Black’]another reason could be the epic and brilliant soundtrack, the credits song is very emotional, I cry cause I want more after it but there ain’t no Xen coming that soon, but it’s not like the tracks alone aren’t the cause behind my eyes getting wet, sniff sniff.</p>
<p>Has anyone else played the mod more than once since release?<br>
If you have, state your reason for doing so.<br>
//sorry if it’s a wrong section, a little moderating work if adequate…</p>
