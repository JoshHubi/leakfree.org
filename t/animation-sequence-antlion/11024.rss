    <title>Animation Sequence (antlion)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/animation-sequence-antlion/11024</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m having some difficulties and I thought this might be a good place to look for help.

I&#39;m trying to make a scene in a video regarding an Antlion, but I&#39;m not sure how to control him. 
I set everything up like I usually do in Faceposer, making my separate characters, their gestures, facial movements etc. Then I put them on my Hammer map as I usually do too.  Just adding the Generic_Actors, scene, and trigger. Everything works great... Except the antlion. It doesn&#39;t even acknowledge there&#39;s a problem at all, the antlion just stands with an idle and doesn&#39;t do his sequence. Does anyone know a fix to this problem? I would greatly appreciate the help!</description>

another technique instead</p>

            <p>The problem isn’t making him walk though (even though that would work for that, so thanks  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  )<br>
It’s that I have a sequence of particular actions I set up for him to do in Faceposer, and<br>
he ignores them once he’s ingame</p>
