    <description>Hello

I have buyed very excited black mesa in steam because I am very fanboy of half life. I am a bit disappointed when I have paid the game in order to support this game (you are making a very good job) and the people of other countries don´t have interface and subtitles in otrer languages. I think than is very important for us.

When are you planning do a update with subtitles and interface in spanish ...etc?

sorry for my english.

Thanks your advanced and congratulations by a very good job in black mesa!!</description>

<p>It is planned and as far as I am aware there were a few spanish people (or rather, one very determined and ambitious person) who already did it for the mod version. However, with decision to go retail and the switch to the new engine, subtitles are implenented in a different way which means we have to do the work again (not all of it, but probably a big part). If they Devs have implemented the new system, they will tell us and get us the files or information. My big guess is that we will see it also along with the December Update.</p>

<p>You can’t expect every person to learn English to play a game. How would you feel if someone said that but instead said Spanish or Chinese? A broken/strange translation is better than having to learn an entirely new language (at least for most people).</p>
