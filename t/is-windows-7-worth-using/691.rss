    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to figure out if I should try windows 7 out or not 

Is it better than Vista. 

Should I backup my files before hand?</description>

            <p>Here’s the thing.  You cannot upgrade the release candidate to the full version.  So unless you want to have a somewhat dysfunctional OS starting in March, then you either need to do a clean install of either Vista or Windows 7 (if you buy it) at that time.  There are ways to get around this (assuming you want to keep vista installed), but I am not going to explain them here. So, if you are competent with installing/repairing operating systems and you want to give it a try, go for it.  From my experience Windows 7 performs better than Vista, but not enough that I would recommend novices to make the switch by themselves.  Yes you would want to back up your data.  You always want to back up your data.</p>
