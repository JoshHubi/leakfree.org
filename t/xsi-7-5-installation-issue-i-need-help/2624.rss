    <title>XSI 7.5 Installation issue. I need help...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xsi-7-5-installation-issue-i-need-help/2624</link>
    <description>I hope someone can help me with this. 

      I downloaded two versions of XSI Mod tool (6.0 and 7.5) 

    When I try to install either of them I get this error &quot;An error (-5006 : 0x80070005) has occurred while running setup
                                                                         Please make sure you have finished any previous setup and closed other applications
                                                                         If the error still occurs, please contact your vendor: Softimage&quot; 

    I&#39;m running Windows 7 64bit. I&#39;ve attempted to run in compatibility mode using Windows Vista Service pack 2 with both versions of Mod tool. 
    I shut down all anti-virus and anti Mal ware programs and don&#39;t have really anything else running in the back round. I have also rebooted my computer but still to no avail 

   Any help would be greatly appreciated and you will not get a thanks in advance. That seems like bad luck

   Edit: Should I maybe try a a fresh install with Windows 7 32 bit? I don&#39;t want to do this unless it&#39;s a last resort. It would make me very sad...  :frowning:</description>

            <p>Well, I did a complete install of windows and installed windows 7 32 bit and then installed XSI Mod Tool and it works smoothly. So anyone else who has this problem has the answer for the most part. That or people already knew and didn’t want to tell me… = )</p>
