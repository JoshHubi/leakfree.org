    <description>Hello,

In my opinion, it would be more than useful to be able to change the volume of different important things that can&#39;t be together in a single option.

I mean, Music &amp; Effect isn&#39;t enough. Music, Voices, Effect, Gun shot, would be perfect. The sound balance is actually very strange, the music and voices are ok, but any gunshots are way too loud (other effects are ok).

So, why Music, Voices, Effect, Gun shot ?

- Music : no changes.
- Voices : It&#39;s better to have the choice to be sure to hear them louder in case of a talking in middle of a fight or something or not at all but still the rest.
- Effects : no changes (only without gunshot)
- Gun shot : separate from effects, because it&#39;s the closest sound from us and the only that won&#39;t change a lot in terms of volume and modulation, not like effects which have echo, distorsion, attenuation, accentuation etc, according to the distance of the effect. The main sound part of the gunshot will always be at the same level, that&#39;s why it&#39;s difficult to link that with the other effects.

At least that&#39;s what I think, but it&#39;s just an idea for you, maybe it&#39;s something to work on it (or not ^^).

Regards,
