    <title>Intro Elevator, Annoying Bug.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/intro-elevator-annoying-bug/9623</link>
    <description>During the intro and the first LOADING message if you crouch just before the load happens you can get clipped into the chair/elevator. After every LOADING screen after you get clipped further downwards until you get off the elevator... Through the bottom of the floor which will kill you. I had to make a new file after that. I posted the pictures of the bug into this imgur album
