</aside>
<p>Copy? You fail to see how science works. It’s cumulative. Speculative science, especially, is willing to reuse preconceived ideas where they’re not inherently flawed. Sure, they’re not going to purposefully play games for inspiration, but once they’ve been exposed to such a concept, it becomes food for thought as credible as anything else. Some effort might be made to avoid copying it entirely. Perhaps by taking those cooperative bunches of trees and packing them together.</p>
<p>There isn’t much illogical within the xenobiology of Half-Life. For example, you won’t be too surprised to hear the ichthyosaur and bullsquid share a common ancestor. Each creature in the game is a viable organism, and that’s part of what made the game immersive - - observing the xenofauna and all the bizarre things a foreign evolution had yielded.</p>
<p>The Xen-tree is a viable creature, and for the sake of an entertaining show, they decided to share its unique existence with that general audience their channel attracts. And nobody is blaming them for this. If anything, we’re disappointed they weren’t willing to take <span class="bbcode-i">more</span> inspiration from the game universe we hold so dear :awesome: but then, of course, us <span class="bbcode-b">real</span> HL-veterans wouldn’t be surprised by anything in the show.</p>

<p>The only speculative show they tried to air that remotely seemed to work was the one which predicted what animals on Earth could evolve into.  Sure, they pegged octopuses for living in the trees, but they stillbased it of solid evidence (Evolution and already existing creatures).</p>

            <p>The tree things is considerably similar to the Xen tree. I do not at all think that anyone working on that show, however, had even known what Half-Life was – except for the one guy that did play it through, and finally snuck in his one suggestion (the tree).</p>
<p>This is all completely speculation, of course.</p>

<p>With the tree, each arm has pretty much the <span class="bbcode-b">same</span> number of segments, <span class="bbcode-b">same</span> proportion, <span class="bbcode-b">same</span> trans-plant-animal composition, <span class="bbcode-b">same</span> lifestyle tactic, and <span class="bbcode-b">same</span> pink, wrinkly skin-like texture that ends up with a claw.</p>

            <p>I’m going with winged one On this one. that tree thing is the only thing that even half resembles anything xenian.</p>
<p>its like saying that xenomorphs are like vortigaunts cause they both have two legs.</p>

            <p>I remember checking this out from the university archive.</p>
<p>It was a little bit enjoyable. The “butcher tree” thing is DEFINITELY a reminder of the Xen Tree, which is often found back-to-back in such clusters. It’s not <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> evolutionarily likely to find its way into the show - - so it was clearly inspired by Xen.</p>
<p>And the “pronghead” <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> have a peck of relation with our beloved bullsquids.</p>

            <p>lol at your wanking to mario comment Winged One. You go so off on a tangent.</p>
<p>I was just saying they had a couple similarities to the Xen wildlife. And one specific creature/plant is exactly like the one from HL1. The butcher tree.</p>

            <p>The show aimed to use prediction and biological science to guess what aliens might look like.  Problem is, their imagination sucks and most of their creations are still roughly Earth-like (They have heads, torsos, legs, etc.)  And they also tried some bullshit story with two robots that are investigating the planet.  The only part that didn’t blow so much was when they both had hard premarital robot sex with a bottle of cheap spermicidal oil, but that wasn’t even in there.</p>
<p>The only speculative show they tried to air that remotely seemed to work was the one which predicted what animals on Earth could evolve into.  Sure, they pegged octopuses for living in the trees, but they stillbased it of solid evidence (Evolution and already existing creatures).</p>
<p>Regardless, even if you just forget for a moment they were trying to teach anything, the show was mediocre at best.</p>

            <p>Can we backtrack a sec from looking at this from a half-life perspective to a general perspective? Thanks. Okay, why is discovery creating a fictional universe about aliens? It seems that that concept would better be used by a company skilled in the creation of fictional shows, as opposed to one which tries to create informative ones. Just wondering.</p>
