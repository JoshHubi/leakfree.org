    <title>NPCs with &#39;additionalequipment&#39;/Weapons keyvalue 0 cause issues</title>

    <description>The `additionalequipment` keyvalue (Weapons) can take on the string values &quot;weapon_glock&quot;, &quot;weapon_mp5&quot;, &quot;weapon_shotgun&quot;, &quot;weapon_rpg&quot;, and 0 which represents random. When loading a map for the first time, this seems to function correctly. However, all subsequent loads will not give a valid weapon.

Each load seems to attempt to spawn a random string as an entity, which to me looks like a use-after-free from the array indexed to give a random weapon. This causes the NPC to be spawned without a weapon.

I created a map to test this theory, which you can find [here (vmf)](https://content.jame.xyz/sharex/crash_test.vmf) and [here (bsp)](https://content.jame.xyz/sharex/crash_test.bsp).

Simply load this map after a fresh restart, and the grunt will spawn with a random weapon. Load it again (without a save load, change the map fully) and he will not have a weapon. The console will reveal messages like such:
```
Attempted to create unknown entity type ACT_VM_FIZZLE!
Couldn&#39;t create weapon ACT_VM_FIZZLE to give NPC .
```
Sometimes even producing unprintable characters appearing as question marks.

An entity like this appears in map `bm_c2a4f` with hammerid `932430` named `hall_grunt`.</description>
