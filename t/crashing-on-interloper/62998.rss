    <title>Crashing on Interloper</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crashing-on-interloper/62998</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve played without any issues, I died on the part where mind controllers spawn for the 2nd time on Interloper. I was able to reload an old save once but then I died on that one too. Now both of my saves wont load. Any ideas?

Edit: I dont get any error messages, just crashes to desktop.</description>
