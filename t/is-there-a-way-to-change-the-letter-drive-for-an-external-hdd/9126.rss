    <title>Is there a way to change the letter drive for an external HDD?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-there-a-way-to-change-the-letter-drive-for-an-external-hdd/9126</link>
    <description>I bought one for my computer a long time ago, and recently, its seemed to have renamed itself from F: to I:. This has created some problems, and I can&#39;t access anything I download. I get an error that says the specified file path cannot be found, and this seems like the most likely culprit. I tried using the program in admin options in the control panel, but I get that exact same error. I can&#39;t be sure, but when I was first installing this external HDD, someone gave me advice to set the default drive things are downloaded to from my C: drive to my what was then, my F: drive. I hope that makes sense. What I need is some way to change the letter drive, and it might fix it. Not sure, but this can be a start.

Edit: I also forgot to mention.  When I plug in that HDD, it says this after a while: This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the default programs control panel.

Yet it works, as the I: Drive.

Disregard thread. I talked to some guy who knows about computers a lot more than I do, and he&#39;s determined the problem is something else.</description>

            <p>Right click computer, click manage. go to disk management. right click the disk you want to change the letter on, click “change drive letter and paths”, then “change”, it’ll bring up a dialog like the one in my screenshot(attached). that’ll aloow you to change the drive mapping in windows.<br>

            <p>I would have told you to change the file path to the new letter but you could also change the drive letter in diskmgmt.msc</p>
