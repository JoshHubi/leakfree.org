    <title>Format an external HD</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/format-an-external-hd/2376</link>
    <description>I want to save some files on a maxtor external HD but the HD is currently set up for a mac and can&#39;t work with osx and windows at the same time so I need to format it. I can&#39;t access a mac right now so I have to format it from my pc. Does anybody know how I might do that?

Also, I&#39;ve already tried maxtor&#39;s customer support and got no help.

Help appreciated.

EDIT: I was able to suffer through customer support and get my problem resolved.</description>

            <p>I already googled and didn’t get anything that would help. The eventual solution I got from tech support was completely different from anything I found on google.</p>
