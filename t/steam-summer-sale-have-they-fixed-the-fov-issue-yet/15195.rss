    <title>Steam summer sale! Have they fixed the FOV issue yet?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-summer-sale-have-they-fixed-the-fov-issue-yet/15195</link>
    <description>I will never, EVER, pay a developer for a game locked at a 90 FOV limit, because I don&#39; like getting headaches/nausea.  Have they fixed the max fov of 90  problem with Black Mesa yet?  

On a 32 inch monitor at 3 feet away, fov 110 is minimum for me and I really want to buy/play this game....but not if it&#39;s locked at 90 as the max.

I&#39;m not speaking about the view model BTW.

thanks for your attention  :slight_smile:</description>
