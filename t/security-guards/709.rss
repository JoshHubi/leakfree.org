    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/security-guards/709</link>
    <description>A few suggestions for the security guards:

1. They should have melee defense abilities (at least against zombies and headcrabs).
It would be weird , if a special trained security force wouldn&#39;t be able to defend themself at close range.

2. It would be nice, if the radios you added to their protective vest would be used in one or two situations as a scripted sequence.

3. It would also be nice to see security guards without their helmet and dirty faces in the later course of the game.

4. Gun lockers and gun racks would be nice furniture details for security stations and also a way for the player to come by weapons.

5. I know, that guards will be able to take better weapons like a shotgun or mp5 (like the rebels from HL2). But in my opinion a few guards in the later course of the game should already have a better weapon. It would make sense at least.</description>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Barneys are keeping their helmets. If you see one without, it’s a zombie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even later in the game they’ll use their glock as primary weapon but can pick up others while traveling with you. They won’t be couvert by mud,sand or blood because it’s painfull to design new character models by that time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bm goal isn’t realism but fun. People don’t forget their helmets but failed to grab a bigger gun or climb ladders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4)Also barneys are supposed to be cannon fodder of the good guys side : limited firepower and training. They can take out small ennemies but don’t match a H/Agrunt without support.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>radio chats : who confirm that ? Need proof</li>
</ol>
<p>6)About melee : is it really necessary outside a scripted sequence ?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree it doesn’t have to be to real but i think guards should be able to climb some basic ladders like ones against the wall but maybe not ones where you have to jump to or get past a obstacle.</p>

            <p>I never said I was running short on ammo, I was saying you could kill things faster with the pistol than with the MP5 and for fewer bullets  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Nor did I say the Barney guards should give you ammo, my comment was unrelated to that.</p>

            <p>Well, regardless of that, it’s only the exotic and heavy weapons like the Gauss/Gluon gun and RPG whose ammo isn’t lying around in huge quantities. Even if you don’t kill the Barneys, you should still have plenty of ammo left.</p>
<p>The ammo system in HL1 is a lot more generous than HL2’s since you can carry a lot more ammo with you and enemies drop a lot too.</p>
<p>In short, I still think that Barneys shouldn’t give you ammo like the HL2 rebels.</p>

            <p>Yes for human grunts.  It does 8 damage per shot instead of 5 and has much better accuracy, to the point that I can pick people off from a distance with 10 shots instead of spraying 50+ shots at them and not even killing them.  I’ll upload a gameplay video if you want to see.</p>
<p>For alien grunts, I use the crossbow, magnum, energy weapon, or MP5 grenade plus a few MP5 rounds.  If they’re far away or engaged with something else, the Hive Hand.</p>

            <p>Once I get the shotgun I usually switch between it and the MP5, I only use the Glock in the early levels and to shoot headcrabs/barnacles/zombies since I don’t want to waste my other ammo on them.</p>
<p>Are you’re telling me that in a heated firefight with half a dozen grunts (human or alien) you use the pistol?</p>

            <p>Say what?  I basically only use the MP5 for the grenade launcher or short range work when my shotgun is low on ammo or I want rapid fire.  Pistol is so much better 99% of the time.</p>

<p>Personally I like it the way it is, now you have to choose between having a friendly NPC to cover your back or taking his ammo.</p>
<p>Although, if he gets killed in action you can still take the remaining ammo  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Here is a worthwhile suggestion for this thread:</p>
<p>Many players of HL (not including me) simply killed barneys for their 9mm ammo. Couldn’t the Barneys in BM therefore give ammo to the player, similar to HL2 rebels? It could be worth several magazines of 9mm, making it more worthwhile to save them than to harvest them for bullets.</p>

<p>How long in total did it take to compile Black Mesa so far? For each map, it takes between 15 minutes and six hours, so, that’s what, a couple of weeks for the entire game to recompile just to explain how robots get around. You either really love us by going into such extreme detail, or hate us by postponing the mod’s release to fill in this plot hole. :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>actually if something when way wrong most people would want to group up. so the security guards having a gun might level long enough to get together. so that explains why there are groups of them in some levels where it looks like there shouldn’t be. my only problem with that is some of them should have melee weapons or something because they would probably have run out or ammo. in the way latter levels the guards that survived that long would defiantly be out of ammo and should have better guns or melee weapons of some sort. and most of them probably would have lost there helmets if they have survived that long think about it. there helmet would ether have been damaged to much to be used or have been lost in the original incident. Unless the guard was hiding in a hole the entire time till freeman cam around the corner most of the guards in latter levels should be war torn and have different guns. plus black mesa is sett to be the size of a city so the guards would be the police force for black mesa as well as the guards. and most cops at least know how to use a shotgun. even i know how to use a shotgun. i think the only reason you didn’t see guards with better weapons is that they where set to spawn with that weapon no mater what and the mechanic to have NPCs pic up weapons didn’t exist yet. and the military in hl has different models for each unit type and each is its own NPC. so the only reason they didn’t have better guns is the tech didn’t exist yet to give them them with out making another npc. The grouping thing is just something that would happen any way no matter what.</p>

<p>I do security at a nuclear power plant…</p>

</aside>
<p>This to me is enough justification, given the amount of radioactive waste randomly scattered throughout black mesa.  xD.</p>
<p>Also, IMO, the entire plot seems to depend on the security guards being the way they are in hl1: i.e., not an entire army, but strong enough that some will survive all the way through.</p>
<p>One thing I think is interesting is that the placement of the guards in hl1 always seemed to lead you in the right direction…I’m thinking that’s a bit weird, since as the player, Gordon seems to have foreknowledge they don’t.  Also, I seem to recall there were parts of the levels that were swarming with security guards, despite the fact that A.  they weren’t particularly safe, and B. they were far away from anywhere that really needed to be guarded.<br>
Just an example; The sheer number of guards in blast pit, which looked mostly abandoned.</p>
<p>Idk to what extent that can be fixed at this point (probably scripted sequences are going to be impossible to change), but for all I know it may be as easy as dropping a couple here and there to solidify the illusion of guards rushing separately to safety, as opposed to HL1 where they were all the same guard and played the role of constant sidekick.</p>
