    <title>Who will do co-op?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/who-will-do-co-op/5202</link>
    <description>Okay, so according to the wiki, co-op could &quot;potentially arrive after the release of SP, but would not be made by the Black Mesa official team.&quot;

That&#39;s all fine and dandy. Yet if co-op is to be made, would that mean somebody would have to copy the materials that were made by the BMS Devs?

Would that even be legal? Because according to the website, the mod is &quot;© 2004-2010 Black Mesa Modification Team.&quot;

Even then, would any mod deveopers that have worked on BMS be willing to take on the project? :fffuuu:</description>

<p>I’m not sure about you guys… but I’ve been hoping for co-op since I heard of this mod.</p>

            <p>Yeah… I was quite shocked because Ram was one of the best level designer I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Actually, I believe the last word with ram was that he was retiring from level design after BM is done.</p>

            <p>Do you guys really want a co-op for BMS? playing the original hl campaign with 2 people wasn’t that great(sven coop on the other hand…), it just wasn’t designed for that. Now custom made maps using BMS materials is a whole different story</p>

<p>Well… so far, the above quote sounds like the most reasonable solution towards BMS co-op.</p>
<p>Not really… but on a serious subject… who is willing to spend the time?</p>
<p>Will it be a BMS DEV? A SYNERGY DEV? WHOM WILL IT BE???</p>

<p>I don’t know, maybe the dev team would give permission for someone or some group to make a co-op mode?</p>
<p>I mean, it makes sense when you think about it, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Everyone who is interested can make BM Co-op!</p>

            <p>It would be really uncool if Bms didn’t OK a third party to use their source material. And to be honest kinda hypocrite, you don’t see Valve being all tight ass with the stuff they’ve worked on. But wtv, its up to them. I just want the mod at this point, could be unfinished i don’t care. P.S. God bless those Synergy boys. They work fast and support their stuff.</p>

            <p>I really hope this isn’t just left to the synergy team to handle. I feel like this conversation has to have taken place multiple times.</p>
<p>“okay, multiple people can get onto the same map? Check. Okay, lets throw in some  vehicle spawn for each player and call it a day. player balance? what if someone get stuck? respawning with half health and a single set of ammo, even though they’re in the middle of a firefight that they came into with full health and suit power and completely filled and STILL died? Save games? What nonsense are you talking about? they have infinite spawns and when someone gets to the end of the map, they’ll drag everyone else to the end too. It’s not like that will interfere with enjoying the game at all.”</p>
