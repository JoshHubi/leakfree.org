    <title>The Black OPS make no sense</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-black-ops-make-no-sense/2140</link>
    <description>Why are they even there? i understand the military but why the black OPS? they dont belong there in the first place!! they dont do anything plot except make it more confusing. 

Are they their to blow Black mesa To hell or simply mess around with military or get the government off their trails? 

They are the most annoying enemy in the game only exception is ninalinth the mutated, upside down, alien fetus that made us sick to our stomachs at the end. I have to say also some parts do not make sense either for instance: what is that sample at the begining of the game? 

Why do you not have clearence to some areas until you get a scientist to open it for you. 

Some aliens dont make sense either. like snarks what are theyre purpose to the aliens? 

Also why does black mesa have nuclear testing i thought they ended that back in the 1950,s. The seven hour war also makes no sense what so ever.</description>

<p>If he meant the black ops as in the assassins, they’re just another arm of the military pretty much in HL. Different soldiers for different roles - in the grand scheme of things they were just another model and enemy to deal with to add a bit of change to the game.</p>

            <p>I actually do think Breen is gone, Valve doesn’t really rely on twists too much. Valve’s style is much more “… and then things got worse.” Even Mossman’s betrayal and subsequent redemption were fairly straightforward, and it’s really the closest thing to a “twist” I can think of. As far as Valve’s style goes, Breen’s death probably happened, and without any odd side effects. Any twist that happens is likely to be with the G-man and/or the identity of his employers, and again, given the track record so far even that is likely to be fairly straight forward regardless of how socking or revealing it is at the same time.</p>

<p>To bring this thread back on track, and to address those that are confused about the marines/whatever killing scientists and trying to blow Black Mesa up, I say this:</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>How can it be confusing - a government cover-up is one of the most clichéd and used plots in science/alien themed stories. <span class="bbcode-u">It happens on some level in almost every alien/secret research facility-gone-wrong book, game and movie ever made.</span> How on earth can it be confusing? A bunch of military-type people were sent in to cover up the aliens / research centre so that the secrets/aliens etc don’t get out to the rest of the planet. That’s it. Simple. It’s not a new concept.</p>
<p>Same with the G-man. People try to read FAR too much into him, especially in HL1. At that stage he was just another cliche - a mysterious official looking man that seems to always be around and have something to do with the aliens and subsequent cover up - added to the story to spice it up. Then they added the twist that he had some sort of powers etc at the end and he whisked you off somewhere.</p>
<p>That’s about it, and tbh that’s probably as far as Valve planned in HL1 with the G-man and military cover up. People seem to try to read much more into these things when there’s not much more to them. They’re just almost mandatory story elements of an alien/secret facility story. Of course with so much interest Valve have developed the G-man further now, but it seems he began as just a sci-fi cliché character, nothing more.</p>
<p>Anyone disagree?</p>

            <p>I don’t really agree with G-Man being Breen.</p>
<p>Maybe Breen is protected by G-Man, and maybe G-Man has saved him in the portal explosion. Like he did (or tried) with Gordon.</p>
<p>Or maybe we’re all wrong, and G-Man is who we’d never thought, like a headcrab.</p>
<p>edit: Why do I have the feeling that this is just a bit off-thread?</p>

<p>It clearly means that after you destroyed the portal at the end of HL2 Breen got shifted into an alternate dimension, gaining unimaginable powers and becoming the G-man. Thus setting everything up so that he would be created so he could take over the world.</p>

<p>Either way, the gman-breen connection just got a little thicker. It only took me two years to notice. Kind of the wrong thread for this. Maybe one of the all powerful, time stopping, make it so you were never born moderators can shuffle this into the proper thread</p>

            <p>Your’re right, it does look more like there are 2 faces on the screen when you scale it down. And it does look breen-ish.</p>

            <p>Matt, I think you’re looking at the other Gman, He’s not on the screen.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk8IdP-upKY" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk8IdP-upKY</a></p>
<p>Look at the video again.</p>
<p>And yes, I think they’re both there.</p>
<p>Have a look at the image scaled down.</p>

<p>I can already see that scaling it down improves the visibility dramatically.</p>
