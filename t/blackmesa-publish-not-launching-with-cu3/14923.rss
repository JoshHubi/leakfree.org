    <title>blackmesa_publish not launching with CU3</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blackmesa-publish-not-launching-with-cu3/14923</link>
    <description>Hi all,
This issue has been around for some time (for me at least) and resulted in me downgrading back to content update 2.
The blackmesa_publish tool has not worked for me in CU3 - not even launched. This is odd especially because maps are being released using CU3 features such as godrays, which means they somehow have managed to publish to the BM workshop whilst on CU3.
So, what am I doing wrong? I&#39;ve tried running it as an administrator. Steam is running while I launch the tool. But only upon downgrading to CU2 did the tool work, and allow me to publish to the workshop.

Does anyone have a solution?</description>

            <p>I just rolled back to the working version, moved the entire bin folder one level up to steamapps/common, and then reselected CU3. This kept the old bin folder (and the old publish.exe) in an easily accessible place, without affecting the game itself.</p>

            <p>what i’ve done is download the version where the workshop tools work close steam rename the Bin folder to say Bincu3 then restart steam dl the other version, then when i want to upload to the workshop i just close steam rename folders so Bincu3 is Bin and the other is say Bincu2 start steam upload files, then just rename Bin folders again, it only adds an extra !00mb to your pc keeping both version on there</p>

<p>If I’m correct - <span class="bbcode-i">and I’m sure I am</span> - you just need to compile the map fully in CU3, THEN downgrade to CU2 (after compiling and everything is done), and THEN upload using working publish tool there.</p>
<p>At least that’s what I’ve done and it worked!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ah, I see. But still - downgrading is annoying as you have to download stuff, and then download the CU3 update to switch back to the latest version. Bug fixes turn into much more of a hassle than before, constantly having to switch between the two.<br>
But, does this mean, perhaps, that the CU2 blackmesa_publish.exe and its required files/folders in that bin, just need to be copied to the current CU3? I’m hoping it’s something as simple as that - and I’m hoping the devs can fix it, as it has been an issue for some time.</p>
