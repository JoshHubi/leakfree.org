    <title>BMDM Voice Chat</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bmdm-voice-chat/13976</link>
    <description>Out of all the servers I&#39;ve joined, it seems as though voice chat has been universally disabled (is it just me?). So, I was wondering if there&#39;s a way to enable voice chat. If not, are there any plans to incorporate this standard feature in a future release? To be honest, with the level of quality found through Black Mesa, I&#39;m really surprised that such a simple, straightforward feature is missing. Not having voice chat really detracts away from team play mechanics, and I&#39;d strongly urge you guys to implement such a feature (it should not be difficult at all, especially if you use steam&#39;s current voice chat features......which are more than adequate). Something as simple as this really elevates the overall multiplayer experience and will greatly increase the product&#39;s longevity.</description>

            <p>Voice chat was disabled as it had some game breaking bugs and we did not have time to debug it. It will be added back in a future update.</p>
