    <description>EDIT: After being down for a week, their FTP servers are back online. Got the driver. Fucking HP. :facepalm:

I need the drivers for an HP Scanjet 6300c.

The HP site &quot;has them,&quot; but their FTP server is on the brink. The driver I&#39;m looking for was released in 2009. I do not want anything older than that.</description>
