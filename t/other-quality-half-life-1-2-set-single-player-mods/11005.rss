    <title>Other quality Half-Life 1 &amp; 2 set single-player mods?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/other-quality-half-life-1-2-set-single-player-mods/11005</link>
    <description>Having caught the Half-Life bug again with the release of Black Mesa, I&#39;ve been digging out old mods to re-evaluate in the light of the team&#39;s amazing effort.

I just re-installed Half-Life to play my favourite old mod &#39;Someplace Else&#39;, which I thoroughly recommend you play if you never have - it&#39;s short but tough, has a great ambience and is set in a superb modified Xen setting. It&#39;s by Adam Foster, who did the acclaimed Minerva mod for HL2, which is a sort of a sequel to Someplace Else - it&#39;s next on my list as I&#39;m not sure I ever actually played it!

I also aim to re-play the superb Poke 646, and also it&#39;s follow up Vendetta, which I also don&#39;t think I ever played.

These mods are all set in the Half-Life universe but are only loosely related - you don&#39;t play Gordon Freeman, are not set in Black Mesa or City 17 and they probably have &#39;non-canon&#39; content, but they are all very good quality and really stick to the Half-Life formula.

Oh, I&#39;m also checking out the Decay port, which I only just found out about.

Anybody have any suggestions for similar mods?  I prefer something shortish with a bit more depth, puzzling and story. I played quite a few very disappointing combat heavy grinding gruntfests back in the day and would rather avoid that sort of thing.

Any suggestions for other quality non-universe mods also accepted  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>I think Mesa - Fallback is good ideas clearly limited by low skill. It’s fun enough, but assets are pulled from a wide variety so it looks really noob-ish and basic.</p>

            <p>Mesa-Fallback is AWESOME. You play as a H.E.C.U. Marine and they actually recreated places, textures and models from the original game and it’s expansions!! <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/mesa-fallback" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moddb.com/mods/mesa-fallback</a></p>

<p>Looks really cool!! Never heard of it till now.</p>
<p>I read on further, still REALLY cool, but not what I thought at first, (most of) it takes place several years after the war.</p>
<p>Something like a marine grunt from someone’s military (barley) managing to survive the INITIAL invasion, probably based on avoiding unneeded combat would be best, if you’re one guy against a strider (or striderS) without some serious weapons run/hide is the only way.</p>
<p>Something similar in feel to HL/BM beginning, first everything’s fine (perhaps some lowly patrol duty), then s*** goes down (portal storms), and suddenly most stuff is broken/ruined/destroyed and combine forces show up ‘out of nowhere’, most of your comrades are dead or separated from you, etc.</p>

<p>I liked Azure Sheep. The ‘Old Black Mesa’ level in particular had a really nice theme and aesthetic that I loved.</p>
<p>POV was a lot better, though, with the only real flaw being that there weren’t many weapons at all, (and then most of them had limited uses) and the energy attack wasn’t very fun to use.</p>

            <p>I really love Half Life 1 mods.  Maybe because I love that GoldSrC, IT’S BEAUTIFUL. But there’s one mod that I really loved, it’s extremely well made, and funny. Half Life: Visitors.</p>

            <p>I am a very big fan of Sweet Half-Life, I’ve actually replayed it several times. Maybe 3 times?</p>
<p>Very imaginative, hilarious (and complicated) scripted sequences. Just be sure to save frequently in different save slots because sometimes a scripted sequence can screw up and you can end up getting stuck.</p>
<p>Also you can have problems if you use the Steam version of the Half-Life High Definition pack, as it doesn’t have some essential animations needed for a scientist to jump over a table. I think that is fixed if you use my Fixed Half-Life High Definition Pack. (Which was something released by me back when I was with Planet Half-Life.) Also some custom “super definition” modelsbased on the Playstation 2 version of Half-Life have problems due to scientists having a slower, more realistic running speed - if a certain scientist can’t outrun a Gargantua, you get game over! To be honest, I think Sweet Half-Life is best played with the old original low definition Half-Life models, since the new models (new soldiers, new scientists in HEV suits, new weapons) are in that old style as well. And you avoid any bugs that way too.</p>
<p>Here’s a pretty cool video someone made, showing off the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Idfla5lC7nQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Idfla5lC7nQ</a><br>
And indeed one of the youtube comments is “lmao﻿ this video made me buy half life years ago”. Sweet Half-Life is over-the-top badassness.</p>

<p>Wha- You just listed <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> of my favorite HL1 mods. Now I have nothing left to contribute!</p>
<p>Oh, wait, I do. Check out Combine Destiny, and its unreleased sequel. The original had some surprisingly fun combat and exploration, while the WIP CD2 has some intriguing squad-based gameplay.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I used to write mod reviews for Planet Half-Life, and Combine Destiny was the only thing I ever gave a poor score to. I was rather disappointed by it as it was very long, but the developers didn’t seem to have many interesting ideas to justify a mod of such a significant length. It was mostly made up of grey/brown corridors full of barrels and crates. Oh and loads and loads of zombies.</p>
<p>I did like that it gave multiple paths and encouraged exploration… but then in some parts it punished the player for exploring - like giving you a hole you can jump down but with no way out, and a message telling you that were dumb for jumping down the hole. I also recall a big dumpster which tempted the player with a medkit at the bottom, but then had no way to climb out of the dumpster.</p>
<p>Also it had bits where you get to team up with Combine soldiers, but then you have very small elevators and doors and tight rooms which makes it a nightmare to try and get them to move around or to follow you. I actually had parts where I was trapped in a room by my comrades and had to use noclip to get past them. If you are going to give the player a squad of teammates, perhaps make the rooms and elevators large enough for several people to stand in rather than have doors and corridors so narrow that you have to go through them single-file and tiny elevators only large enough for one or two people. Getting to be part of a squad of Combine soldiers should have been awesome but ended up being frustrating. I know some people really like Combine Destiny though, I don’t want to crap all over it, it’s just I wouldn’t put it on a list of “must play” Half-Life 2 mods because I think the only thing really notable about it is that it is long.</p>
