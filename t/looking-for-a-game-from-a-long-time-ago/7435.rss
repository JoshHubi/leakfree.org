    <title>Looking for a game from a long time ago..</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-for-a-game-from-a-long-time-ago/7435</link>
    <description>When I was in the 6th grade, my parents were very much against me playing video games, or anything video game related, and as such, I was reduced to sneaking my friend&#39;s game informer magazine home and reading a few interesting articles. I did this for about a long time, and I remember one article I read was about a game in which a fog had overcome a small town and turned many of the residents into mindless flesh eaters. The protagonist was apart of the USCG and came out of the fog remembering nothing. In the game he would have to survive by collecting items and driving cars which all had different attributes (muscle car, truck, sedan). For when the night came, is when the fog would descend again and the zombies would attack.The only way to keep these particular zombies away, would be light, and the whole point of the game would be to gather supplies and survivors in order to keep these generators protected and running. This was the main concept of the game, but the only problem is, is that, I can&#39;t remember the title  :frowning: 

Please help, as this forum seems like the only place on the internet not full of immature people and spam bots. 

Thanks in Advance,
Veritas</description>

<p>This seems remarkably similar to your description, but unfortunately the game was cancelled.  There’re three links at the bottom of that article, which give previews of it, including some images.  There is also a video on a couple of the sites.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Found this, and 4 other images, on the IGN article…  Fog and everything  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure it’s Alan Wake, that game was in development more or less since the 360’s launch, which should fit in with the established timeline.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all the help all, 6th grade for me was 6 years ago, I am 18 years old now, I was 12 when I read the article. Something that stuck out in the game was the induction of cars that could run out of gas. That is why it was so important to choose the right car for the situation. For example; although a truck was a very powerful zombie killer, it ran out of gas quickly. I don’t know if this helped at all but, your help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>I actually thought that sounded closer to Alan Wake, since there are driving segments in it and none in Silent Hill to my knowledge. Plus, Alan Wake was originally supposed to be open world.</p>
<p>Damn good game too.</p>
