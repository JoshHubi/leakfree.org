    <title>Ground Turret Bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ground-turret-bug/13901</link>
    <description>There seems to be a weird issue where if you shoot them with something like a .357 Magnum, the light that turns on when you&#39;ve been detected, attack it, or cross the beams stays on even when they have been completely disabled. Not only that, but where its laser points to is still on (even though its beam is gone).

Edit: Also, that light in the picture (not from turret) stays in that position even if you move the turret.[img]https://i.imgur.com/icHvz3B.jpg[/img]</description>
