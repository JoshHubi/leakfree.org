    <title>CoD 1: Game of the Year Edition (PC) Help</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cod-1-game-of-the-year-edition-pc-help/6683</link>
    <description>I just recently Reinstalled Call of Duty on my PC. This PC (which is actually a laptop if that makes any difference to any of you) has run it just fine for the past few years. But this time, it didn&#39;t work. When it finished installing, and it came up (the main menu) the entire thing was blank. You could hear audio and you could click on the different things, but when it finished loading, it brings you right back out to that main menu, and a box is there. Only problem is, I can&#39;t read that box either, so I can&#39;t fix it.

This also happened on another PC (this one is about 12-14 years old) and it also had no problem running it up until that point. and the same thing happens to it every time. I have tried reinstalling it again and uninstalling and shutting it down numerous times, to no avail. 

I have heard about this happening before, and it was something about registration files or something. Is that the problem?

EDIT: I remembered something happened during the installation. When it was downloading from the first disk, it stopped and a box came up, saying it couldn&#39;t find it. I took it out and put it back in after trying the second disk, and it worked fine. Then the problem above happened.I don&#39;t remember if this happened to the older computer.</description>

<p>Anyways, maybe your disc is damaged or something, so you could try downloading the game as suggested earlier. You can still use your own CD key so it doesn’t make any difference anyway.</p>

<p>If you said “Xbox’s are crap because they’re xbox’s” I would agree with you, they are, but then you went completely off the subject and started commenting on how I look instead.</p>

<p>I think, looking at his avatar, he’d be quite happy with a player base of 12 year olds.</p>

<p>You got the original copy? (Pss, not like it matters anyways), try downloading the CD1 from a torrent site or something and reinstalling it with that</p>

            <p>I just recently Reinstalled Call of Duty on my PC. This PC (which is actually a laptop if that makes any difference to any of you) has run it just fine for the past few years. But this time, it didn’t work. When it finished installing, and it came up (the main menu) the entire thing was blank. You could hear audio and you could click on the different things, but when it finished loading, it brings you right back out to that main menu, and a box is there. Only problem is, I can’t read that box either, so I can’t fix it.</p>
<p>This also happened on another PC (this one is about 12-14 years old) and it also had no problem running it up until that point. and the same thing happens to it every time. I have tried reinstalling it again and uninstalling and shutting it down numerous times, to no avail.</p>
<p>I have heard about this happening before, and it was something about registration files or something. Is that the problem?</p>
<p>EDIT: I remembered something happened during the installation. When it was downloading from the first disk, it stopped and a box came up, saying it couldn’t find it. I took it out and put it back in after trying the second disk, and it worked fine. Then the problem above happened.I don’t remember if this happened to the older computer.</p>
