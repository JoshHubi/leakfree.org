    <title>How does Gordon have a HUD if he doesn&#39;t have a helmet?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-does-gordon-have-a-hud-if-he-doesnt-have-a-helmet/2641</link>
    <description>Just out of plain curiousity how does Gordon see how much health he has or his suit functions because I doubt his glasses can zoom in like that

If you notice in either HL game the suit doesn&#39;t have a helmet...... 

I mean how has no one noticed this and his reflexes must be olympian to have dodged literally over a thousand headcrabs. He doesn&#39;t even have a beanie like the other rebels he just has a stern expression a pair of glasses and a cool beard

Also no one better ban me for questioning our God because that would really suck

LOOK AT IT! :freeman: :freeman: :freeman: :freeman: :freeman: JUST LOOK AT IT!</description>

            <p>Hmm, so the real question is: if the flashlight could regenerate its own battery then why HEV couldn’t?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>So it’s just the weapon select that gets hidden?<br>
Or does the auxiliary power &amp; flashlight get hidden too?<br>
Or does the auxiliary power not work because the primary power is out?<br>
Or should the armor power regenerate when the auxiliary power isn’t being used?<br>
Or should the armor power drain when the auxiliary power runs out?</p>
<p>Or how about not punishing the player for being bad at the game by making it harder? Or trying to change the mechanics of the game to fit some unexplained sci-fi logic that only exists to justify the game mechanics to begin with? Or does that just make too much sense?</p>

            <p>actually, I really like the idea. In order to use the HUD you actually need to have suit power. Removing the entire hud would be a bit much though, but leaving the crosshairs along with the health and ammo monitor while taking the rest of the hud away when at 0 hev power could be neat.</p>

            <p>it’d be cool if when you ran out of suit energy the hud flickered and turned off.</p>

            <p>I know your supposed to be looking through gordon’s eyes, but I always thought of it as the HUD was just a visual way to show gordon’s mind’s inventory on ammo and stuff. As for the Homing signal in ep2, I haven’t really thought about it.</p>

            <p>Has anyone considered the possibility that there is in fact no HUD, but instead exists a representation of what Gordon is aware of. The player can’t feel the same things as Gordon, so things how hurt he is (health) are shown visually. I always assumed that the HUD didn’t exist in the actual world but was instead a representation of status for the benefit of the player.</p>

            <p>I’d also like to point out that Gordon doesn’t have legs and apparently can just float up ladders while something, probably his beard, makes a banging sound against the rungs.</p>
<p>Translation: It’s a game, they do things to make it easier to play. Only questions about the actual content of the game are valid.</p>
