    <title>Call of Duty: Black Ops</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/call-of-duty-black-ops/5835</link>
    <description>Kinda surprised no one made a thread about this yet.

Very good solo campaign. Plot kinda deviates from the CoD norm, since it&#39;s more character based and not about all-out war. Also, you can blow up the enemies&#39; limbs Soldier of Fortune style.

Still haven&#39;t beat it, but so far it seems lengthier and a bit more varied gameplay wise than MW2.

As for multiplayer, it&#39;s basically MW2 with dedicated servers and slightly more balanced killstreak bonuses and no tactical nuke (as far as I know, the largest killstreak is 11 kills). However the game needs a patch to fix the lag spikes players are getting during the matches and there also seems to be numerous reports of bad graphical performance on MP only.

The server browser is decent enough, at least it&#39;s far better than BC2&#39;s one, and there&#39;s an option to change the field of view in the settings, which is great for me, since I can&#39;t stand the default field of view from MW2.

Anyone else willing to share their opinion on the game?</description>

            <p>Even bots have bad taste in games. But yeah anyway, last CoD game I played was MW1 which was actually decent. But after BF3 comes out I’ll probably be like Call of What? Ohhhh, you mean that game that nobody plays anymore… except 12 year olds. Yeah BF3 is going to own.</p>

<p>Even then, the MP didn’t change too much. It had different killstreaks, more weapons, etc. But it still came down to the same game modes and everything. You still run around trying to kill other players in exactly the same fashion as in CoD 4. There were no major changes to the formula of the game, and that’s what will make a game series stagnate, yet Activision knows that people will continue to buy the games regardless because people don’t seem to care.</p>

<p>You know, why wasn’t Black Ops just a DLC for MW2? Would have made a lot more sense. They appear to be using the same engine. Other than changing the set of weapons and killstreaks, the gameplay has hardly been changed. The campaign, though an entirely different storyline, doesn’t really bring anything new to the table. Aren’t sequels reserved for, I don’t know, things that actually evolve the series? Black Ops is hardly more different than MW2 as BFBC2 is to the Vietnam Expansion.</p>

            <p>CoD needs to stop making campaign and release only the multiplyer at a price of $40 or less no one seems to care about the campaign and it sucks anyway. The only fun part that I actually didn’t have to force my self to play was the prison break on vorkuta. The campain is basically a revamp of WaW with some Vietnam.</p>

            <p>My opinion: Black Ops sucks compared to the past CoDs.</p>
<p>The CoD series is becoming more and more linear. It’s just not that fun anymore.</p>

            <p>Singleplayer in this game is pretty interesting and epic, but multiplayer is just meh in my opinion. I never got used to CoD gameplay.</p>

            <p>The first time I played the single player, I wasn’t a fan. but then I went back and selected kowloon city level, I think it’s called “numbers” or something like that. This time i pretended i was at the arcade, and i was playing a game like Time Crisis, and let me tell you, it was the most fun I’ve had in a call of duty game since COD1. I wish the single player was less of a story and more like the spec ops mode from MW2.</p>

<p>I liked MW1 and MW2’s campaigns (probably going to catch shit from it, but oh well), but when I rented Black Ops the campaign bored me.  It just doesn’t let up the action at all except the loading screens.  At least in MW1 you can sneak around as an SAS so it lets up on the action a little, instead of just constantly throwing action in your face like the game was on speed or something.  I did like the multiplayer more than the single player and thinking if I should buy it or not.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed. Not sure if its the constant action that annoyed me or not, but I just didn’t find the game enjoyable at all, even compared to MW or MW2.</p>
