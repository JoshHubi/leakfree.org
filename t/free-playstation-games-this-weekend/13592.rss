[b]EA is celebrating PlayStation’s birthday with free games this weekend[/b]

Sony is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the PlayStation is weekend with their first ever PlayStation Experience event in Las Vegas. And since it’s a birthday, game publisher Electronic Arts came to the event bearing gifts: free games.

For this weekend only, three major EA releases are free to download from the PlayStation Network — one game for each of Sony’s current platforms.

PlayStation 3 users get [url=https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/games/mirror&#39;s-edge/cid=UP0006-NPUB30838_00-MIEPSNNA00000001]Mirror’s Edge[/url], a cult-classic. It’s a first-person parkour game that’s heavy on style, and EA is currently working on a long-awaited sequel.

Vita gamers can download [url=https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/games/need-for-speed-most-wanted/cid=UP0006-PCSE00089_00-NFSMW000VITA00NA]Need for Speed: Most Wanted[/url], a racing game that’s surprisingly good on the portable system.

The PlayStation 4 gets the newest free game of the bunch: [url=https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/games/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare/cid=UP0006-CUSA00453_00-PVZGWPS400000000]Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare[/url], a team-based multiplayer shooter set in the colorful PvZ universe.

All three games are free to download on PSN right now, but you’d better hurry and grab them. They’re only free until 10 p.m. central time Sunday night (December 7).
