    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-much-would-you-pay-if-bm-wasnt-free/7440</link>
    <description>well I myself would pay max 20$, I just don&#39;t think paying for game more is right. I just have more important things to spend money on...

p.s. yes i know that some of you would pay 99999999999k but try to remain realists.</description>

<p>Ooh that’s awesome. Why tease us with things we’ll never have! :’(</p>
<p>Soundtrack will be released for free. Though it would be the decent thing to donate a (large) penny or two to Joel. Odd that he can accept donations and you guys can’t. What’s the technicality behind that?</p>

            <p>I could have sworn I posted in this thread.</p>
<p>I’d pay $40, mabie even $50 for this great remake. It’s certainly much better than plenty of generic shooters that sell for $60.</p>

            <p>I have been anticipating this mod for a long time and at this point there’s no way I would allow myself not to have it and since I think pirating a game made by such a small team is about the most despicable scumbag thing you can do (its not exactly like your ripping money out of the pockets of some fat cat at EA) I would happily pay whatever was asked.</p>

            <p>I am a patient bastard. If the game was to be released at the usual big hit price (around 40 Great Bri’ish Poonds Sherlings  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) I’d wait about 6 more months. By that time all the easter eggs would be found, all the spoilers spoilt, and the price would drop by about half to 3 quarters (depending on how successful it is) then I would buy it and enjoy the game as slowly as it may take, raping the graphics off. And once I have finished, I will play again, this time with the use of spoilers and cheats etc.<br>
I have it all here, in my hollow head  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
