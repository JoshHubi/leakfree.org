Does anyone know the console commands if any for the m4 spas 12 or barretta? I would really like to know so i can stop looking at these boring weapons :[</description>

<p>And you can’t use a console command, like in BM, you have to download the High Definition Pack, which will also replace the enemies models for “improved” ones.

<p>I wouldn’t recommend installing the official HD pack from Steam, you will not be able to play Mods properly with it. There’s A HD pack by “your evil twin” that’s much better in this regard <a href="https://planethalflife.gamespy.com/fullstory.php?id=105708" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a></p>

<p>Yeah, I don’t like the HD Pack alltogether to be honest. If you want HiDef Half-Life but with the original weapons, I would myself suggest the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/diamond-half-life-final" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Half-Life DiamonD Pack</a>. HD Models and better effects, only the new crosshairs and HUD were irritating. But I restored the old ones easely.</p>
<p>Now I’m back to original Half-Life anyway. Nothing can beat that!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I downloaded a pack for higher def models of the original half-life weapons.That shotgun in HL is valves really low def rendering of a spas 12 with out a stock. Barrettas are over rated; I don’t know why the US military uses them. Glocks are way better.</p>

            <p>They are not boring, they’re much more satisfying than the HD shit, but the SPAS HQ model just made me cum.<br>
