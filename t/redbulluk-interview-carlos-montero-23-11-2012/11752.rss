    <description>I&#39;ve found it on reddit. 
It&#39;s an interview made @Montero by RedbullUK (wait, what?). 

here&#39;s the link:[url=&#39;https://www.redbull.co.uk/cs/Satellite/en_UK/Article/Remaking-the-Greatest-Game-in-History-Whats-next-021243283985168&#39;]https://www.redbull.co.uk/cs/Satellite/en_UK/Article/Remaking-the-Greatest-Game-in-History-Whats-next-021243283985168[/url]

It quickly became a re-imagining. Black Mesa takes its name from the research facility in the original game that quickly turns into the battlefield between mankind and aliens - both of whom want your character dead. While it sticks to the storyline, maps have been tweaked and changed, there’s new voice acting (more than 6,500 lines of dialogue), and an epic new soundtrack you can download separately for free.

And then there’s the ending. Half-Life’s finale takes place in an alien dimension where it turns out that jumping between platforms in a first person shooter is still really annoying. The team actually took the decision to release this section separately - big changes that make it far less frustrating seem likely when that segment comes out.

Montero and the team are also working on a multiplayer mode, though he’s not saying much about what we can expect to see. “We are still very much in the early phases so it&#39;s hard to speak about it too much,” he says. “One of our primary goals is to bring back the flavour and feel of a lot of old-school shooters, along with some modern polish. It wouldn&#39;t be something new per-se, but something very different from most modern games out there.”

Though Montero isn’t sure what the team will work on next, or if it will even stick together after Black Mesa is finished (“I think there are quite a few big ideas, but not everyone is in agreement”), he says it’s all been worth i
