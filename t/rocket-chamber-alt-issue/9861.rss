    <title>rocket chamber alt issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rocket-chamber-alt-issue/9861</link>
    <description>I am trying to complete the stage where you have to fire the rocket to kill the monster, however i have checked in the options and alt is listed as quiet walk, but i still hear my footsteps when holding it and the monster always hears me, is this a common problem or is it something i am doing?</description>

            <p>the AI listens to your footsteps - in order to go past it, you have to crouch.<br>
the engine’s handling of the stop-on/step-off from the ladders is a bit buggy and can produce sounds that are loud enough for the tentacles to go after it.<br>
if this happens throw a grenade on the opposite side of where you want to crouch next.</p>

<p>Crouching isn’t the solution here. Instead, throw a grenade in the opposite direction to that you wish to go, then run for the ladder. Once you get up (or down) it, lob another grenade and run the opposite direction again.</p>
<p>Doing it this way means it is very easy to run through this section with no loss of health.</p>

<p>That may be an issue certainly…to be honest, I think most people crouched (CTRL) when sneaking around the monster, which has the same effect.</p>
