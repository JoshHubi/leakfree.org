    <title>Scripted Sequence - Collision with Chair</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/scripted-sequence-collision-with-chair/14422</link>
    <description>Hi all. Again, another possibly stupid question - though I&#39;ve been playing around with this for a while to try and fix it but to no avail so far.
Right now I&#39;ve been trying to figure out scripted sequences to get scientists typing away etc. in the background in labs. However, when I place the scientist with the scripted sequence in the sitting position on the chair (which is a prop_dynamic_override, as I saw was used in Anomalous Materials for a similar &#39;typing&#39; sequence), the scientist collides with it or something, because when I see him, he is standing up (usually inside of the desk). However, when I move him and the scripted sequence away from the chair in an empty space, he performs his sequence fine.

Thanks guys! Hopefully it&#39;s a simple fix though I haven&#39;t seen much info about this with my searches.</description>

            <p>Ah, I get you. Yep, I’m working my way down from the labs at the start, down the elevator through the coolant rooms etc. We should eventually meet up at some point!</p>

            <p>Isn’t UC mainly below office complex?<br>
I’m happy to take suggestions for which chapter to do next, other than apprehension or residue processing haha. Eventually we can get all chapters completed and have a working Black Mesa to roam around in.</p>

            <p>Will try with cube maps and see how it is!<br>
Sorry about UC, perhaps we can work on different maps in it so we don’t feel like we’re stealing it from each other. Then we can put it into a bundle on the workshop for UC! Sound good?</p>

            <p>Awesomesauce. Can you update the video to one with cubemaps?</p>
<p>And it turns out that UC is the chapter I want to restore next, but since I’ve put the project in hibernation I am hardly in a position to “claim” it… best of luck to you in taking your stab at it.</p>

            <p>Thanks Admiral, I’ll definitely be using teleporting for more simple cases in the future. However, the<span class="bbcode-b"> moving func_door elevator worked</span>! With dynamic lights parented to it (though I still need to perfect the lighting on them, it looks a bit too bland I think).<br>
When the elevator reaches the bottom door (OnFullyOpen) the doors open (both the doors attached to the elevator and the doors that are on the floor) and when it moves back up, they close before moving, and open again when it reaches the top.<br>
There’s one or two minor glitches, like a little jolt before it starts moving (could add in a ‘shake’ effect to make it blend in) and the lighting does sometimes flicker darker for a second then back to normal, but I’m fine with that and I’m pretty happy.<br>
Definitely the way to go for two-stop elevators. <span class="bbcode-i">Especially </span>if you can see outside the elevator whilst moving! (This one could have easily been a teleport but a lot of elevators have see through parts and therefore have to be moving).<br>
I’ll have to try a teleport elevator another time with something else, but this seems easy enough - group the main elevator blocks together, make it a func_door. Add on an invisible block going from the bottom of the elevator to the floor you’re going to. Group that with the elevator and make that the same func_door too. Parent all objects inside to the elevator, make the lights light_dynamics and parent them. Close/open doors when pressing button and OnFullyOpen/Closed. Pretty much done! A tracktrain looks to be a lot more fiddly and harder, but once again, it’s needed for multi-stop elevators (if you can see outside the elevator, otherwise you can make the player teleport to a floor below by pressing a button).</p>

<p>(Admiral, yes this is c1a1c - would love to work with you on the pre-disaster maps though if you want to work by yourself I can understand. I’m working on getting Unforeseen Consequences into a working state but I don’t want to make my own project and ‘steal’ a chapter from you, so to speak. Just a suggestion!)</p>

            <p>Well, the televators in OCPD encompassed the whole elevator car and were activated with either touchtest or just enable when someone pushed the button- this meant that everything in the elevator transitioned at the same time, and preserved object holding. Additionally, using the local landmark field allowed me to maintain the player’s location relative to the elevator. Moving decals ARE a limitation, but since this was pre-disaster the player had no weapons so it wasn’t a big deal.</p>
<p>Long story short, trigger_teleport has a lot more functionality than most people are aware of, and its worth playing around with. But if you’ve got a tracked elevator working for you by all means keep using it, I’m just here to suggest things and am VERY interested in seeing what you come up with.</p>

            <p>The big problem I see with a trigger_teleport is keeping the player facing the same way, not moving their viewpoint or position at all, other than up/down. With a moving elevator, there’s none of that problem. But yes, cubemaps and lights will be a problem with the moving elevator. As with the vent, I can always make it non-see-through if I made it a teleport.</p>

            <p>Depends on what you mean by more efficient. The teleport has a few downsides to it, namely any held objects won’t transition with you (and if you configure them to come along with you, they’ll immediately pop out of your hand), and neither will bullet/scorch marks. If those aren’t a concern, then sure. Go right ahead.</p>
<p>Also, there appears to be a vent in the ceiling of that screenshot. A teleport would make that look veeeeeeeery suspicious.</p>
<p>Basically, it depends highly on what exactly you’re trying to accomplish.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s always a good idea to get conversant in multiple methods of doing things where available, and in this case a properly configured trigger_teleport <span class="bbcode-i">would</span> be more efficient…</p>
<p>But regardless, I’m somewhat interested in seeing how your cubemaps and lights react to the moving elevator entity.</p>

<p>Admiral, yes, I could have used a trigger_teleport from the start but now I know how to make elevators it’ll be useful for future maps!</p>

            <p>Well, I’d recommend from the start using a trigger_teleport, but (while it’s terrible practice) you could also have the elevator button open the doors after a delay timed to synchronize with when the elevator stops.</p>

            <p>Alright, I tried again using the door method and it worked! Everything moves down together.<br>
However, to make it go down the full length of the elevator shaft, I had to add on an invisible block as part of the func_door that went down to the bottom floor, because func_doors only move the length of themselves before stopping.<br>
And now, I’ve just got to get the doors to open when the elevator stops moving. Any ideas?</p>

            <p>I recommend using invisible doors rather than trains for elevators. Much neater, in my opinion, and also doesn’t mess up nearly as much when trying to handle reverse movement. The exception, however, would be if you’re attempting to create a multi-stop elevator. Then I’d recommend using a train.</p>
<p>To get things to move with your elevator, just use parenting. Is there something obvious that I’m missing here about your setup?</p>

<p>As you can see, there are quite a few props inside, including light entities. There are also doors attached to the elevator which need to move down with it, and a vent etc.<br>
I’ve tried various things by looking on YouTube - making the elevator act as a ‘door’ with an open and closed state (to move to both floors), and I’ve tried using the tracktrain and path entities to move it down, but I can never get everything to move with it- and one time, all of the props moved down but not the actual elevator.<br>
I’m thinking of making it simply ‘teleport’ the player to a clone of the elevator on the bottom floor, and somehow making it not look obvious (like the ‘monument’ entity for loading maps - keeps the player in the same position)</p>
<p>This is probably my biggest annoyance so far, and hopefully my last. I’m new to this so apologies for all of the questions, but you guys are far more helpful than a wiki article or a youtube video which might not answer my question.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>That’s really interesting. Also kind of stupid, in my opinion. Lights I understand, but scripted sequences? Hmm…</p>

            <p>I got rid of the names for each scripted sequence, and they start automatically now. Interesting!</p>

            <p>I’ve had no problems at all using the start on spawn flag with blank pre action idle, entry, and post action idle animations and the animation I want in action animation. Perhaps it matters that I have deselected move to position and selected loop action animation. It may also be relevant that I do not <span class="bbcode-i">name </span>my scripted_sequences, as naming some entities like lights can alter their behavior.</p>
<p>Regardless, you may want to experiment with the begin_sequence and cancel_sequence outputs, as well as addoutput. I’m not sure what changing the values of a scripted sequence mid-animation does, but it’s worth playing around with.</p>

            <p>Great, I’ll do that then! Thanks.<br>
Now - I’ve got scientist doing a scripted sequence of her pressing buttons on a console. This needs to be looped. There seems to only be a setting that says “loop action animation” so if I put the animation in Pre-Idle would that still work?<br>
Also, I want the player to trigger the next sequence for the scientist - so that she walks to another console (as I can’t find an actbusy.txt) but because she’s looping her animation she doesn’t begin the next sequence when triggered (I’ve set it up so that it knows what the next sequence is, and she would walk to it etc)<br>
Thank you - can’t try this out right now however!</p>

            <p>“Start on Spawn” is a misnomer. It really means “Move to position on spawn, then play idle animation until BeginSequence gets called”.</p>
<p>So, setting the animation as a pre-idle animation should do the trick.</p>

            <p>I don’t mind triggering it anyway, though I’ll look into it. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I don’t know quite what to say to you there, ticking “start on spawn” always worked just fine for me. You’re sure that the animation you want is set as the action animation, and there is nothing wierd in the idle, post idle, etc. fields?</p>

            <p>It’s all working perfectly now, thanks! Set the keyboards to debris and all good.<br>
Yes, setting the scripted sequence to “don’t move” is very useful, as I don’t have to make sure to align the sequences with the NPC and so forth…<br>
Just one thing - would there possibly be a way to start sequences automatically, without triggering? I set the sequence’s flag “Start on Spawn” ticked but it still needs a trigger.<br>
Thanks again.</p>
