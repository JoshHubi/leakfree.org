    <title>How would YOU announce Half-Life 3</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-would-you-announce-half-life-3/13737</link>
    <description>So let&#39;s say you work at Valve and you have the glorious task of announcing the most anticipated game of the 21st century.

How would you announce it?

Would you make an ARG? or would you make an insane presentation with combine strippers at E3?

I want to hear your thoughts, go wild   :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

            <p>Through ARG, leaving it to us to find and unlock episode 3 , which would be tied to the xen update, also with the rest of the games in the Half-life and Portal games.  Important info in each game that would lead you to a solution for a puzzle in another game.  Bringing together the alternate time lines, episode 3 ending with a Gordon lost in time and space, to get the fans rabid for official Half-life 3.</p>
<p>decoding an ip address for us to log into, and unlock the hidden content.  Perhaps big brother is lying to us, they say its not there…But it is, trust nobody, with it not being safe, we have to find it for ourselves,  working together in unison to defeat BB and the ones that watch.</p>

            <p>I would probably do it with a countdown, but the website the countdown is on has a URL like “<a href="http://half-life-3-the-game.ru" rel="nofollow noopener">half-life-3-the-game.ru</a>” or something along those lines (you know, so that it totally sounds fake).<br>
Make the Lambda Logo on the countdown page really badly photoshopped and make it look really amateurish in general.<br>
People will quickly just call it an obviously bad troll and move on. But then, when the countdown is at 0, the most epic trailer in the history of gaming is being played and game activation codes for Half-Life 3 are being displayed, but only temporarily to reward those who have been waiting for the countdown to reach 0.</p>

            <p>Well, you’d have to do it at E3, of that there’s no doubt. Here’s how I’d have it go down: there’d be a fairly standard preamble about showing a trailer for their next project, no hint at all they’re finally dropping the bomb. Then, the lights would dim, and for a moment, there would be nothing but a black screen.</p>
<p>Then…</p>
<p>“Dr. Freeemaaaan…”</p>
<p>cue Half-Life logo with a ‘3’ in it.</p>
<p>Then there’d be a little speech by the G-man with at least one line about how 'you’ve been on quite the little…vacation, haven’t you?" or something like that.</p>

            <p>I would start with a very complex ARG, that the final end result has nothing to do with half life. After that, “accidental” leaks would happen. We would talk about Ricochet 2, portal and left 4 dead. I would hint at a new upcoming game. Another, more complex ARG. Final result is a picture of a briefcase. And finally, after two years of this, i would go to E3, talk about VR, steam machines, and the VIVE headset. Before i walk offstage, I would say" Oh, and also, Half-Life 3 was released for free on steam today. Only people who downloaded it during this conference will get it for free. For everybody else, 60 bucks. Deal with it." and then i would walk off stage.</p>

            <p>A month before release perhaps (without being announced) they start putting on sales for every Half-Life Game - at $3 - starting from HL1 till EP2. And then on the last day, they release a teaser - very vague, and at the end, a 24 hour countdown with the lambda symbol in the background.</p>

            <p>I would do it how Bethesda did Fallout 4. Start a countdown timer with a faded Lambda symbol in the back and a clearly visible crowbar. The countdown would be in days, hours, and seconds and it would NOT be “Valve  time.” When it’s over, start the most epic trailer the world will ever see. I would probably have it be Alyx giving a monologue on the previous events so that we’re all caught up and keeps us waiting in great anticipation.</p>

            <p>I don’t think it would matter how it was announced as long as Hazardous Environments interrupted something else to begin the announcement. Lights flicker off, Hazardous Environments, Gaben.</p>

<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Mr. Someguy:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m glad I saw this, I actually thought this through long ago.</p>
<p>Before the trailer is revealed, Valve will hint at or openly mention Left 4 Dead at a gaming convention, then leave the stage briefly while a trailer appears on screen.</p>
<p>The trailer is ambiguously titled, only listing a “3” and nothing more. The narration opens up <span class="bbcode-i">"It was so many years ago, they took our planet from us, they took our homes, our families, our lives… But I will <span class="bbcode-b">never</span> become one of <span class="bbcode-b">them</span>.</span>" During this narration, the camera will pan through scenes of destroyed cities, wrecked military vehicles, abandoned countrysides, and the like. After the narration ends, we are shown a small dilapidated cabin room in which 4 people stand around a table full of weapons, ammo, and supplies. They’re speaking about their plans, to escape or attack, when the leader shushes them. “Hunter” he says softly, everyone looks uneasy, one person reaches for a gun but he brushes their hand away “No noise”. We hear some growling and shuffling outside, and the group look even more concerned. “Go away…” one grits under their breath. Everyone jumps as the metal door starts banging “Oh no…” one mutters, then the banging stops, and a piercing shriek is heard from outside.</p>
<p>Then <span class="bbcode-b">BOOM, </span>a <span class="bbcode-i">Combine Hunter </span>bursts through the door as a crushed fast zombie is dropped to the floor in front of it<span class="bbcode-b">. </span>Cries of “IT FOUND US” and "HUNTER!"ring out as the 4 scramble for their weapons open fire. The Hunter immediately impales the closest survivor, then sprays down another with its flechettes before charging the third and smashing him into the wall. The last man flees through a side door and out through an old horse stable, but before he can escape the Hunter drops down infront of the exit from the roof. The man slips and falls into his back, screaming as he turns to crawl away, but it’s too late, the hunter drags him off camera and<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b"> “HλLF-LIFE 3”</span></span> flashes over the screen.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is beautiful, but I think it would hit heavier if the door slammed open revealing the Hunter and Fast Zombie, then the Hunter slumps forward and collapses, dead, with a Crowbar firmly planted in the side of it’s head. Then there’s an orange zap and the crowbar flashes away to the side, in the style of retrieving the sawblades in HL2.</p>

You’re scenario for the teaser/trailer is freaking awesome!<br>
But, where is Gordon Freeman?<br>
I say, here’s a bit changed ending in your trailer.</p>
<p>When the Hunter jumps the guy, and he starts to crawl back, the Hunter slowly moves towards him.<br>
Then, a camera positioned down on the ground looking the Hunter from behind 20 feet away, Gordon takes a step into<br>
the camera view with his right leg…and then a Freaking, Heavily used and Bent Crowbar is lowered down in the middle of the screen,<br>
as the Hunter turns around and the survivor runs away.<br>
Then BAM, Half-Life 3 logo, Steam, Valve and others stuff roles through at the end<br>
as every Half-Life fan gets a cerebral abscess.(Brain damage in general).</p>
<p>That’s the way i see Gordon in a new HL trailer.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t. It’d just show up on the front page of Steam one day with the words “Now Available”.</p>
