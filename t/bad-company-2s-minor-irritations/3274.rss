    <description>1. PC CROSSHAIR

sure, pc crosshair has to be like COUNTER STRIKE or some shit but jesus christ, I love the circle crosshair so much. The circle crosshair was nice and let me know exactly if I could spray to kill someone, or had to aim down the sights more than the &#39;cross&#39;hair.

2. Lack of commo rose, easy spotting.

Sure, who doesn&#39;t like to spam the Q button a million times and spot the entire enemy team without even seeing them. I would like the old commo rose or a simpler COMMO rose, so i can tell me mates to move up or mount that vehicle instead of freakin spamming q and hoping i say the right thing

3. Recon not being a sniper

Okay, the sniper can use SHOTGUNS and other unlockables.

Wait this is a good thing, nevermind.

4. No jets?

Okay, let me get this straight, there was PLANES in battlefield 1943, but no JETS in bad company 2?

:fffuuu:

These things aren&#39;t big enough problems to make the game a bad game. Just some things that irritate me because dice is turning battlefield into COD or some shit.</description>

            <p>I am just frustrated with PB being down and the autobalance not working. It is annoying to always be on the team of 4 people who are facing down 20 people that are a higher level than you. Also, just the other day, I came across a few tanks cruising around out of bounds without blowing up… there are aimbots and autoknifes out there already too and with PB down, they are all game at the moment.</p>

            <p>Damn this game!<br>
I have only played “Squad Deathmatch” so far however I always seem to be put with a bunch of bad squad members. They do not communicate at all and are either spamming grenade launchers at random or camping with a sniper.<br>
I don’t actually mind the sniping however when they do it facing the out of bounds section of the map I want to cry.<br>
Basically I am looking for some people to play with who communicate through either mic or text and have at least a little skill.</p>
<p>Name: Busterofwar<br>
Feel free to add me!</p>

<li>PC CROSSHAIR</li>
</ol>
<p>sure, pc crosshair has to be like COUNTER STRIKE or some shit but jesus christ, I love the circle crosshair so much. The circle crosshair was nice and let me know exactly if I could spray to kill someone, or had to aim down the sights more than the 'cross’hair.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Lack of commo rose, easy spotting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, who doesn’t like to spam the Q button a million times and spot the entire enemy team without even seeing them. I would like the old commo rose or a simpler COMMO rose, so i can tell me mates to move up or mount that vehicle instead of freakin spamming q and hoping i say the right thing</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Recon not being a sniper</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, the sniper can use SHOTGUNS and other unlockables.</p>
<p>Wait this is a good thing, nevermind.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>No jets?</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, let me get this straight, there was PLANES in battlefield 1943, but no JETS in bad company 2?</p>
<p>:fffuuu:</p>
<p>These things aren’t big enough problems to make the game a bad game. Just some things that irritate me because dice is turning battlefield into COD or some shit.</p>

</aside>
<p>In my opinion all of these irritations make a fair, balanced, and more enjoyable game. And by the way, BFBC2 has to be one of the greatest online games I’ve played sense CSS.</p>
<p>1)Non-dynamic cross hairs ruin games (HALO)<br>
2)Camping ruins games (COD MW2)<br>
3)Okay, I’ll give you that one…<br>
4There are about 4 helicopters per team on nearly every map, why is a jet necessary?</p>

            <p>I wish you could remove the damn crosshair in the singleplayer campaign, instead you’re forced with a crosshair and this stupid hit indicator that flashes everytime you hit an enemy, spoils the immersion imo.</p>
