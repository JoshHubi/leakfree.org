    <title>GameTap (monthly fees for games instead of per-game)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gametap-monthly-fees-for-games-instead-of-per-game/6095</link>
    <description>[url=https://www.gametap.com]GameTap[/url] is a very unusual digital distribution site. Rather than individually buying games, you pay a flat monthly fee ($5 at the moment as part of a promotion) and get EVERY game in their library. They have a lot of older games, but also plenty of new ones (it&#39;s usually not the cream-of-the-crop mainstream games, mostly hidden gems)

Since the amount monthly is less than most MMOs, it&#39;s a pretty enticing offer. If you sign up before January 2, the price will never go back up to the standard $10/mo. for you.</description>

            <p>Yeah, Gametap is not a rental service. I think you’re mixed up.</p>
<p>Sam and Max is on there; if you sign up, you get their first two seasons, which are both fun. If you look at the third tab on their site (retro games) you get everything on there too.</p>
<p>(and yes, as the other guy said, you launch it from your browser. Retro games are played in-browser using a plugin. They used to have a 3D “starter” application for games, but decided a browser app was easier)</p>
<p>I will highlight the two big disadvantages to Gametap: They do not give CD keys for games for multiplayer (they don’t have many multiplayer games anyway) and you cannot mod the games as they’re stored in an unusual format.</p>

            <p>I have no experience with GameTap. but what legofreak described sounds exactly like GameFly.</p>
<p>The main advantage that Netflix has over GameFly is that I get my next movie in a reasonable amount of time.  It takes a week to get another game from GameFly.</p>
<p>Didn’t the Sam &amp; Max episodes first come out on GameTap?</p>

            <p>the renting system is exactly like netflix. you get a few games in the mail and you can keep them as long as you want. also, if you want to keep the game they send you the box for a discounted rate.</p>
<p>i would get it if i could afford it</p>

            <p>Doesn’t it make you run them in-browser? I recall the commercials from like six years ago showing that it did.</p>

            <p>I can see it being an interesting idea, but I would never try it. If I want a game I will just buy it to have it forever, so I can load it up anytime I want and I don’t need to pay for loads of games I don’t want.</p>
