    <title>Alternatives to google ads?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/alternatives-to-google-ads/12279</link>
    <description>Sooooo, I&#39;m looking for services like google ads, to put advertisements on my (wip) website and earn big $$.

It&#39;s supposed to become a place where users can create &quot;channels&quot; and upload content. The content being any of their own creative endeavours, including text/pdf, music etc, images and videos.

So in other words, a place for people to show off what they create.

Comparable to deviantart, I suppose.

The closer the ads are to the site&#39;s content and its spirit, the better, of course. 

Any recommendations?

Preferably small images (190x90, something like that), and/or banner ads.</description>

            <p>What kind of website is it? Portfolio, webcomic, business?</p>
<p>There’s a lot of demographic-centric services out there that are less “last week you searched for crew neck tee shirts, so here’s some crew neck tee shirts” and more “here’s something akin to the content you are currently viewing that you might actually click on”</p>
