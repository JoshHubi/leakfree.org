    <title>Particle Effect Improvement Pack</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/particle-effect-improvement-pack/10469</link>
    <description>[b]E: I have released a preliminary collection containing many updates to most weapons, along with other across-the-mod effects!  See [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=538539#post538539&#39;]this post[/url] for video, details, and a download link[/b]

Black Mesa is fantastic.  It&#39;s more detailed, intricate, well-paced, coherent, and full-featured than most full games, let alone mods.

I don&#39;t think that some of its particle effects are quite at the same standard as the rest of the project, though; so, I&#39;m doing what I can to correct that.

Because this is my first time using Source&#39;s particle editor, I&#39;m starting small, focusing on the most frequently seen effects (like the generic dust impact effect, which was in dire need of a facelift).  I&#39;ve already made a first pass on the MP5, Shotgun, Tau Cannon, and the aforementioned impact effect, and right now I&#39;m poking at the gib-system effects.

I&#39;m currently using only existing SDK Base/BMS sprites, and .pcf files (as far as I can tell) don&#39;t contain any actual image data, so the total filesize increase is negligible; the above improvements combined don&#39;t constitute even 100KB of new data.

I&#39;ll update this thread with more WIP videos each time there are enough new things to justify the bandwidth.</description>

<p>Well the video uploaded more quickly than I was expecting, but I guess that’s good for you guys!  Below is information about and a download link to the first collection; I will mirror this in the OP</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydeCbUqcTTM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydeCbUqcTTM</a></p>
<p>This first collection contains improvements to the following particle sets:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Glock</span><br>
-Brighter and punchier flash, added a bit of smoke, and increased presence of the sparks from “wait there are sparks” to “slightly visible”</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Magnum</span><br>
-Punchier and more centralized flash as opposed to the old mess of random flares, added a quick flaming sprite on the muzzle, prettied up the initial smoke puff, added a smooth rope-based smoke trail</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">MP5</span><br>
-Brightened up the flash, added a slight blue tinge to match the third-person flash, also added some smoke</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Shotgun</span><br>
-Larger and punchier flash, added some small round particles to simulate buckshot bits, more/brighter sparks, smoke transitions from quick thick puff to wispier residual stuff more smoothly and naturally, wispy smoke moves and behaves a bit more naturally</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">RPG</span><br>
-Added a big initial smoke puff to the flash, residual muzzle smoke is a bit darker and wispier, projectile trail is now rope-based (more consistent and natural)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Tau Cannon</span><br>
-Added a muzzle flash (there wasn’t one at all!), added lots more flavor and spice to the projectile impact while reining in some of the wilder and uglier orb-scattering</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Gluon Gun</span><br>
-Initial shockwave is shorter and punchier, and now emits a quick burst of flickering orbs, flickering orbs around beam are larger, more numerous, and twist around to mirror the energy coil</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Hivehand</span><br>
-Muzzle flash is based more around goopy liquid, projectile trail spiced up with some neat black-glowing-white bits, projectile impact now emits some buzzing orb-things, more natural -looking goop, and has a brighter, punchier flash</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stationary turret</span><br>
-Vastly improved muzzle flash mostly along the lines of the third-person MP5 flash, also uses way fewer particles</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Generic impact</span><br>
-A lot more punchy and forceful, transitions into residual smoke which is a bit thicker but doesn’t last quite as long, slightly larger</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Metal impact</span><br>
-Added a bit of quick, dark smoke, brightened, enlarged, and shortened the flash</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Flesh impact</span><br>
-A bit more emphasis on the misty stuff (more visible at a distance)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Human/alien gib effects</span><br>
-Added some mistsmoke to the main explosion, re-aligned the big fluid things to more clearly reflect a 360-degree explosion, added lots more detail to the bleed-out attached to gibs</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the things I would very much like to improve is the basic explosion you see for e.g. all types of grenades, but this appears to still be the pre-2007 hardcoded explosion, meaning there isn’t really anything I can do about it unfortunately</p>
<p>If I ever get this very un-fun bug worked out then an optimized and improved world effect set for Unforseen Consequences will be next up, which should hopefully also include other minor things here and there (possibly more improvements to the stuff in this pack)</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/t6zqp3t6q075tct/bm_particle_improvements_pack1.rar" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://dl.dropbox.com/s/t6zqp3t6q075tct/bm_particle_improvements_pack1.rar</a></p>
<p>To install, replace the folders inside SourceMods/BMS with the corresponding ones inside the .rar.  Make sure you back up the existing files first in case you need to revert!</p>

<p>Is there any way I can get this to work with the steam version?</p>

            <p>Hey DSD Loving the particle pack… But is there any chance you can add smoke particles to the flare?</p>
<p>as a stand alone enhancement… Perhaps a pink sprite and smoke particles?</p>

            <p>My problem is the generic impact, not sure if it has been changed but the impact on the metal wall shouldn’t have dust flying off it. It should be sparks that’s flying out of it.</p>
<p>And the muzzle flash of the MP5 shouldn’t have a blue color hue to it, this makes it look like a HL2 combine weapon.</p>

            <p>Just tried this out, muzzleflashes look way better. I think the MP5 muzzleflash looks kinda odd with all that blue though, colors should look more like the glock muzzleflash imo.</p>

            <p>You open the .rar, go to your BMS folder (… Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/BMS) then copy it into there. The program will automatically merge the folders. Just copy &amp; replace after. <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Vortigaunt" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">I discovered the Vorts can use one of their new attacks to blow shit up too</a>so I’ll use that as an example:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>In order to allow them to use the new attacks, it requires you to add a command to your skill.cfg located inside of your steam directory.</p>
<p>Example directory (if Steam is installed on your main drive by default, note the system for this is 64-bit): C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS\cfg</p>
<p>To modify the Skill.cfg, you simply need a text editor like Notepad (installed on all Windows systems by default) Right-click on it, and then scroll down to “open with…” then find Notepad. Once you’ve done that simply add this line to it (be it at the end or under //ALIEN SLAVE inside of the folder) exactly as is and then save the .cfg:</p>
<p>sk_alien_slave_dispel_enable “1”</p>

            <p>Well the video uploaded more quickly than I was expecting, but I guess that’s good for you guys!  Below is information about and a download link to the first collection; I will mirror this in the OP</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydeCbUqcTTM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydeCbUqcTTM</a></p>
<p>This first collection contains improvements to the following particle sets:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Glock</span><br>
-Brighter and punchier flash, added a bit of smoke, and increased presence of the sparks from “wait there are sparks” to “slightly visible”</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Magnum</span><br>
-Punchier and more centralized flash as opposed to the old mess of random flares, added a quick flaming sprite on the muzzle, prettied up the initial smoke puff, added a smooth rope-based smoke trail</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">MP5</span><br>
-Brightened up the flash, added a slight blue tinge to match the third-person flash, also added some smoke</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Shotgun</span><br>
-Larger and punchier flash, added some small round particles to simulate buckshot bits, more/brighter sparks, smoke transitions from quick thick puff to wispier residual stuff more smoothly and naturally, wispy smoke moves and behaves a bit more naturally</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">RPG</span><br>
-Added a big initial smoke puff to the flash, residual muzzle smoke is a bit darker and wispier, projectile trail is now rope-based (more consistent and natural)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Tau Cannon</span><br>
-Added a muzzle flash (there wasn’t one at all!), added lots more flavor and spice to the projectile impact while reining in some of the wilder and uglier orb-scattering</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Gluon Gun</span><br>
-Initial shockwave is shorter and punchier, and now emits a quick burst of flickering orbs, flickering orbs around beam are larger, more numerous, and twist around to mirror the energy coil</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Hivehand</span><br>
-Muzzle flash is based more around goopy liquid, projectile trail spiced up with some neat black-glowing-white bits, projectile impact now emits some buzzing orb-things, more natural -looking goop, and has a brighter, punchier flash</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stationary turret</span><br>
-Vastly improved muzzle flash mostly along the lines of the third-person MP5 flash, also uses way fewer particles</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Generic impact</span><br>
-A lot more punchy and forceful, transitions into residual smoke which is a bit thicker but doesn’t last quite as long, slightly larger</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Metal impact</span><br>
-Added a bit of quick, dark smoke, brightened, enlarged, and shortened the flash</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Flesh impact</span><br>
-A bit more emphasis on the misty stuff (more visible at a distance)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Human/alien gib effects</span><br>
-Added some mistsmoke to the main explosion, re-aligned the big fluid things to more clearly reflect a 360-degree explosion, added lots more detail to the bleed-out attached to gibs</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the things I would very much like to improve is the basic explosion you see for e.g. all types of grenades, but this appears to still be the pre-2007 hardcoded explosion, meaning there isn’t really anything I can do about it unfortunately</p>
<p>If I ever get this very un-fun bug worked out then an optimized and improved world effect set for Unforseen Consequences will be next up, which should hopefully also include other minor things here and there (possibly more improvements to the stuff in this pack)</p>
<p>Download: <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/t6zqp3t6q075tct/bm_particle_improvements_pack1.rar" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://dl.dropbox.com/s/t6zqp3t6q075tct/bm_particle_improvements_pack1.rar</a></p>
<p>To install, replace the folders inside SourceMods/BMS with the corresponding ones inside the .rar.  Make sure you back up the existing files first in case you need to revert!</p>

            <p>hello</p>
<p>As Xalener has mentioned I have been very busy with not getting paid to mod video games other than Black Mesa, and have simply not had the time I would have liked to dedicate</p>
<p>After trying to poke back in, I am now running into an indecipherable bug which causes all of the level-specific particle effects to not happen until I load the .pcf files in-editor, which is obviously a problem for the end-user who should not be expected to have to do that every time they play.</p>
<p>So rather than stick to the original plan and wait until everything is done, I aim to release sub-collections incrementally – until I get this problem with the env_ stuff sorted out I naturally can’t do any of that; but!  I am sitting on a wonderful collection of improved things as you have seen in previous YT updates, along with a few extra things I’ve cobbled together in the interim (weapon effects, impact effects, some blood/gib stuff, etc.)</p>
<p>I am currently in the process of polishing them off and recording another show-off video, and will likely have these avaliable for your extracting pleasure before the end of the day.</p>

<p>Thanks for keeping us updated, Xalener. Much appreciated!</p>
