    <description>at the start of bm_c3a1a the ceiling caves in, and you run ahead and meet a guard. If you go back in the room that collapsed there are several pieces of debris (long items, such as I-beams or duct work) which look like they can be walked on, but I can walk right through them like they&#39;re not there. One of them looks like a ramp back up to the walkway from the lower road level, and it&#39;s kind of an immersion killer when you can&#39;t use it that way.</description>
