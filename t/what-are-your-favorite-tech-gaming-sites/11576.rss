    <title>What are your favorite tech/gaming sites?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-are-your-favorite-tech-gaming-sites/11576</link>
    <description>For me it&#39;s [url=&#39;https://theverge.com&#39;]the verge[/url] and [url=&#39;https://rockpapershotgun.com&#39;]rockpapershotgun[/url]. 

[url=&#39;https://www.polygon.com/&#39;]Polygon[/url] may take RPS&#39; spot though (it helps that it&#39;s an absolutely gorgeous site).

What about you?</description>

            <p>Polygon and Gamers With Jobs for gaming. I’m still kind of an RPS fan, but I feel like everything about that site has gone downhill over the last few years. Some of their best writers left, the community crawled way up its own ass, and they seem to have run out of ideas for interesting features.</p>
<p>Polygon is the future. They put together some great talent and have made the community a huge focus.</p>
<p>For non-gaming stuff, I used to be a huge Slashfilm fan, but like RPS, they lost a lot of their star writing talent and replaced them with some really mediocre college students (though Russ Fischer is a great writer and he’s still around).</p>
