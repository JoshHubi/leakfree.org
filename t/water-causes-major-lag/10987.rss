    <title>Water causes major lag.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/water-causes-major-lag/10987</link>
    <description>Hi,

The game runs pretty smooth on high graphics, but whenever i get near to water it causes major lag. I allready have the watertextures set on lowest as possible but it does not work.

Wich other settings could help me?</description>

<p>You know, FAQ had been created in order to save me and other people doing support work at their own will some time. There is a lot of valuable info in FAQ so it won’t hurt if people would actually read info instead of sitting and waiting for someone to post them the exact instructions to fix their problem. Bird would never learn to fly if it would keep sitting in the nest endlessly being fed by its parents.</p>

<p>Side note - of course I’m running boot camp. I highly doubt that I could run even a GoldSource game in Wine or a Virtual Machine… playably at least.</p>

<p>Read a FAQ sticky thread, there’s a set of config settings that could help you to temporarily turn off water reflections which are the problem cause for your case most likely. Also, if you’re playing on OS X using Wine or CrossOver - consider buying/installing BootCamp + Windows, you have a really bad GPU to play this game on its own and using D3D-&gt;OGL emulation provided by Wine doesn’t help either.</p>
<p>As for OP, I have to write it once again as I had been doing it 100500 times in other threads: please please PLEASE DO READ BEFORE YOU POST sticky and DO READ FAQ sticky before reporting the problem and please please please DO FOLLOW REPORTING GUIDELINES. Include hardware and software specs of your PC in the reports. For FPS dropdowns - include screenshots of the problematic spot (or spots) with the budget panel turned on.</p>
<p>We’re not magicians here on forums and can’t provide any help unless we know as much details about the problem as possible.</p>

            <p>Same boat here. The game runs great except for the water causing lag. Have even tried dropping all settings to the lowest possible, and using r_cheapwaterstart to no avail. If I look up at the ceiling, I get 100+fps, look down at the water, and framerate drops to 10 or fewer… while standing still.</p>
