    <title>Well, looks like Gordon does have an helmet afterall</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/well-looks-like-gordon-does-have-an-helmet-afterall/15235</link>
    <description>I found this on r/HalfLife/

[spoiler][img]https://i.redd.it/zhixtwrrf7bz.jpg[/img][/spoiler]

And here&#39;s where it&#39;s taken from: [url]https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/35781/how-did-gordon-freeman-survive-the-entire-storyline-without-a-helmet/35784[/url]

I know that the source is a bit wonky, but I do believe that he&#39;s actually Chuck Jones.

Hopefully it will finally settle the eternal question of helmet vs no helmet :p</description>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">The canon of the Half-Life and Portal series has never been officially defined by Valve, and never will be.</span><br>
Series writer Marc Laidlaw stated that the issue of canon is<span class="bbcode-i"> “something the fans came up with”</span> and that they do not have an official stance on it. He remarked that they “do not get involved in issues of canonicity” and that <span class="bbcode-b">“canon itself is non-canon”</span>, letting the games stand on their own.</p>
