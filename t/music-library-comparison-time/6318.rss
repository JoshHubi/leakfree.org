<p>anyway, i’ve purchased albums that i’ve previously pirated. i’ve also pirated albums that i’ve previously purchased.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Same here, in fact.</p>
<p>There are two albums, from one artist in particular, that I never would have known about if it hadn’t been for a torrent. And if it weren’t for the same torrent, I never would have gone to see them play in person (with three other people), or bought a shirt, or been happy thanks to not needing to rip the CDs to computer myself just so I could listen to it whenever I needed it the most.</p>
<p>And let’s <span class="bbcode-i">definitely</span> not forget how massively happy the music has made me, especially their unreleased album that hasn’t been made available <span class="bbcode-i">for sale <span class="bbcode-b">or</span> download <span class="bbcode-b">anywhere</span></span> but for the dedicated fans who made it available to the loyal masses. [COLOR=‘DimGray’](It wasn’t released, nor will it ever be released, due to changes in their musical direction… apparently it’d be bad press to release something that doesn’t mesh too well with their current sound. But it still sounds stellar.)</p>
<p>Doing a tally, that’s about $104 from one torrent of stellar music, not counting the price of beers where they played. Just because bands great enough to motivate me to this are extremely rare <span class="bbcode-b">doesn’t mean</span> I should only be allowed to listen to the 2 CDs and nothing else (unless I hassle to search for each and every reasonable listen on youtube, or live the rest of my life in Pandora trying to hone every facet of my sophisticated tastes).</p>
<p>When enough people have shared their sizes, I’mma run some statistics to find some averages and deviations so we can get an idea of where we as a community stand on maintaining digital music libraries.</p>

            <p>A picture of a painting != an actual painting. Nowhere close.  Let’s not kid ourselves. That’s a ridiculous statement made from ignorance and a brutally twisted metaphor to justify theft. I’m not even going to perpetuate the ridiculousness of that by further dwelling on it.</p>
<p>You like it? Buy it. Should be pretty straightforward. Someone put a lot of fucking work into making something you enjoy. You think you should just be entitled to that for free because you somehow convinced yourself it’s okay to simply take it, since apparently “nobody cares” if you do?</p>
<p>Since I’m taking the time to argue the point, I know of at least one person that does care. On that note, I’ll just claim the moral high-ground now, and enjoy my fucking pedestal. It may be cold and lonely up here, but damn is that sense of smug righteousness mighty fulfilling!</p>

            <p>Damn near all my music is legit. I am a strong advocate of supporting the artists I love to hear, especially since a lot of my favorites lie outside the major labels and count on album sales and tour proceeds like I count on my weekly paycheck.<br>
I kinda look at pirating that stuff like I look at someone just walking in, taking one of my paintings off the wall and walking out without so much as a thanks. Not a good feeling, that.</p>
