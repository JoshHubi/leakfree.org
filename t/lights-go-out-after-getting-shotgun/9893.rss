    <title>LIGHTS GO OUT AFTER GETTING SHOTGUN</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lights-go-out-after-getting-shotgun/9893</link>
    <description>Hello, forum.
I was playing through and I had just gotten the shotgun and opened the silo door. I went down the elevator and got walked down the hall, rather than getting on the tram. I got to the pool of toxic waste and i jumped down the ladder and all of the lighting goes out. I tried my flashlight, and I could hear it turning on, but no light. I could only see by the light of my mussel flashes, and that&#39;s not exactly ideal. Could someone help?
Thanks.</description>

            <p>Thanks for reporting. Well, it seems that the shader that causes blackout in your case is either in another vcsfile or is hardcoded in dll.</p>

<p>Ok, I used the one where I put the game_shader_dx9.dll in Backup from bin. That caused white lines to cross the bottom and right side of the screen, as well as across diagonally from the top left to the bottom right. Then I tried doing both solutions (placing bth game_shader_dx9.dll in a Backup and bms_postprocess_ps20b.vcs in a Backup) and got the same problem. Then, I tried just using bms_postprocess_ps20b.vcs but I got the blackout problem.</p>

<p>Em… uhgm… but THIS is the bug reporting forum, isn’t it? As for the problem of the OP - I doubt it would be ever fixed by devs as this problem is due to game not working properly with the outdated hardware which is about 10 years old. It’s a miracle the game is able to start up and even offer some acceptable level of the gameplay with the GPU which is THAT old.</p>
