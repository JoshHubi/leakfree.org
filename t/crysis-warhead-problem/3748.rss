    <title>Crysis warhead problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crysis-warhead-problem/3748</link>
    <description>I have only been able to play  warhead up until the end of the &quot;frozen paradise&quot; level because when it ends and is starting to load the next level, it crashes at 56%. I even downloaded a patch which did not solve the problem, I reinstalled the game, still this problem consistently happens at the end of the &quot;frozen paradise&quot; level. Any  help regarding this problem would be immensly appreciated as I have only had the game for 2 days.</description>

            <p>I believe that some programs (in the launcher or in add/remove programs) can have an additional repair feature which fixes(?) or replaces corrupt files? I don’t know though, not many games have these features.</p>

            <p>If you run setup while the game is installed, it sometimes gives you a few options. “Repair” being one of these.</p>
<p>If you have Vista or 7 I know you can also repair by going into “Programs &amp; Features”, finding Crysis: Warhead, and selecting “repair” from the options shown. (This again assumes the game allows that)</p>

<p>Does Crysis:Warhead have a repair installation option? I would try that.</p>
</blockquote>
