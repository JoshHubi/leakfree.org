            <p>I don’t personally feel the need to have “hostile” leeches from a gameplay perspective. I like the idea of them being re-introduced in areas where they existed before, but without dealing damage. I always liked that they nibbled at you, but the damage thing would be confusing, so maybe keeping nibbling in without harming you could work.</p>

<p>Dunno, maybe add a switch that you need to push, would force players to move to the generator. Also I don’t know if they should be harmless props, would be very weird as they’ve always been agressive creatures. Maybe they could put skeletons around where they’re harmless, to show that they’re not attacking you because they already had a snack :3.</p>

<p>I kind of wonder if it should be an option that you can turn on and off.  The playtesters of the mod could not understand the leeches or spent too much time and/or ammunition trying to kill them, so they were removed.  I wonder if it should be left as a toggle-option, off by default but you can turn them on if you desire.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yep. I initially thought that it is a disabled feature that i could enable from somewhere, but this is not the case. Maybe a mod or an official release will change that in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your comments and have a very safe and productive day, as they say in Black Mesa.</p>

            <p>As linked by Zeroniz0, the leeches may be re-introduced in a later iteration as strictly an environmental entity like the cockroaches; they cannot be killed and they cannot hurt you.  If the source code is released, you may be able to mod the mod in such a way to reintroduce enemy leeches, but you have to be mindful of the entity count.</p>
<p>I kind of wonder if it should be an option that you can turn on and off.  The playtesters of the mod could not understand the leeches or spent too much time and/or ammunition trying to kill them, so they were removed.  I wonder if it should be left as a toggle-option, off by default but you can turn them on if you desire.</p>

My idea was to see them in at least 2 parts, one being in power up in the floded room as in half life, where many boxes or other props where you can stand would be spread around to make an interesting jumping puzzle, rather than just walking to the generator, and maybe once the generator is working having the water drained like in half life if it si possible in source.<br>
The second was to see them in FAF before entering the sewers, at the small pond next to the hatch, where the security guard would decline to swim through shit and leeches, it would make sense at that part.<br>
I also thought of maybe adding a little fish tank at QE with two or three leeches inside, would be nice touch. I really hope that if they don’t bring them back, they at least re introduce them somewhere at Xen.</p>

            <p>they could be re added, take the current fish enemy, shrink it, replace model, change health and damage, and there have a leach… though that would take a modder that knows what they are doing and require messing with many of the maps that have water in them.</p>
