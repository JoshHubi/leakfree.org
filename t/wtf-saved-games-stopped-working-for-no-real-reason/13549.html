          <p>Well, I started playing BM like, 2 weeks ago, installed a bunch of mods such as “BM:UpLink”, “OaR:UnCut”, “ST:UnCut”, the re-animation pack along with it’s retexture 1.4 pack and a bunch of custom bits and pieces from gamebanana, you know, skins, GUIs / HUD Icons, a walking script, a few scripts that would fix some sounds from cutting off, some better sounds / sprites / particles / textures / a re-balanced skill system, overall, just usual stuff that anyone would install nowadays, i tested all that stuff and i had no problem with any of the things i installed on top of BM, so i started a full playthrough, got to the A2 map of “OaR:UnCut”, and, well, i’m a “quick save” whore, so i started saving every now and again, until at one point i went to load my last quick save (witch was the only save i had, simply because i usually clean my old ones so as not to get confused and stuff) and the game just froze there (please don’t ask me where exactly this happened, i had no way to load back to that point, and it was one of those times where the game did not create a TGA picture for me on the save slot, so i practicly had no way to get back there)… i tried deleting the sound cashe from the maps folder, deleted all the files in the save folder except the save itself, nothing, and no, i won’t use the chapter select, because it spawns me with different stats, i would rather do a full playthrough from scratch… but i just want to know if there might be a way to prevent this from happening again, or if anyone else had this problem, and if there’s a fix for it, i’ve fully uninstalled BM, the Source SDK and Steam itself, i’ve even deleted all “Valve” keys from the registry (because BM was all i had on it), i’ll re-install it all and get my mods back and stuff, but i just want to know if any of you guys ever had this, or if you can give me some advice as to how i can maybe avoid this the next time.</p>
