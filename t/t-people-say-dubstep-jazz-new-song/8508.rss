            <p>It was good, but there was too much clutter.</p>
<p>The sax and beat should have been louder than everything else; I have no idea what this ^ guy is talking about.<br>
Don’t believe me? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsBFyylIMIM&amp;t=0m45s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsBFyylIMIM&amp;t=0m45s</a></p>
<p>The constantly occurring electric-bass notes kept rising in volume and interfering with the lead.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Advice</span></span>: Keep the drums and sax at the same level, but drop that electric bass’ volume, but also its frequency so we can hear it at a lower register without it cutting off the Sax. <span class="bbcode-b">Trust me</span>, you never want to sound-out the lead – it destroys the flow of the song and makes it feel choppy.</p>
<p>Remember, the Sax and Drum Beat carry and lead that song, nothing should be louder than them unless you’re using a clever transition.</p>

            <p>I felt like the electronic sax(?) masked the more subtle things you were trying to do here.  It was just too loud compared to everything else, and the only things I could hear clearly were it, the quieter sax playing in the background, and part of the bass track.</p>
