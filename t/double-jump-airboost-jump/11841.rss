    <title>double jump &amp; airboost jump</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/double-jump-airboost-jump/11841</link>
    <description>In the skill.cfg it has the codes and values for the double jump and air boost jump but try as I might I can never complete a double jump, and have no idea where or when to complete an airboost jump.

also....

I used to increase my sprintspeed in both HL and HL2 but cannot really detect any change when I up it in Black Mesa.

I have upped sv_maxspeed to mirror sprintspeed but cannot notice any change.
The game records the changes as is evident in the developers console if I write the cvar again but no ingame performance changes are noticeable.

Has anyone else noticed this, knows what I might be doing wrong and know how to complete either one of the jumps.</description>

            <p>I’ve wondered if the air boost jump might actually be the jump in surface tension, when you jump on those “heineka dozels” that propel you to the top of the tower to call in the air strike. “heineka dozels” are something an old jewish pal of mine would call anything he couldn’t think of the name of  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hasn’t a dev mentioned that the Long Jump Module would have a new feature in Xen? Perhaps that’s what the double-jump is, who knows…</p>

<p>Thanks, that makes a little more sense than just “there isn’t one”<br>
In fact, I worded my second post differently because the detail of this mod led me to believe the developers wouldn’t just add odd bits of code, abandon them and then leave a reference to them in the skill file. At least, I wouldn’t. It just doesn’t make sense to me, with all the attention to detail in the rest of the mod.</p>

            <p>There are also sound files about double jump in jumpmod folder. Maybe they used codes from jumpmod as placeholder and removed the airboost and double jump and retained the long jump.</p>
<p>Note: just maybe</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>First of all, I apologize for originally putting this post in the test chamber.</p>
<p>The following are the first set of codes in the skill.cfg</p>
<p>bms_normal_jump_vertical_speed				“160”<br>
bms_normal_jump_crouch_vertical_speed		“160”<br>
bms_double_jump_vertical_speed				“200”<br>
bms_airboost_jump_vertical_speed			“80”<br>
bms_airboost_jump_forward_speed				“360”<br>
bms_airboost_jump_original_speed_mod		“0.25”<br>
bms_long_jump_vertical_speed				“150”<br>
bms_long_jump_horizontal_speed				“460”<br>
bms_long_jump_delay</p>
<p>I assume bms stands for “Black Mesa Source”.<br>
So I also assume they are not hold overs from either HL or HL2 but are codes the developers added to the new game. Since they are written into the skill.cfg, I would also assume they are valid codes that serve some purpose in the game.</p>
<p>So my question is: What purpose do they serve? Though I understand that the longjump is not necessarily needed till the last part of the game and Xen, what about the double jump and airboost jump?</p>

            <p>There’s no “double jump” other than the long-jump, and you only need it in Xen.</p>
