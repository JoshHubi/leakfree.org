    <title>Potential wars covered in call of Duty games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/potential-wars-covered-in-call-of-duty-games/6878</link>
    <description>I have recently started to enjoy the series... Or should I say Call of duty 2 and 5. It has occured to me that call of duty does its best(meaning most interesting story and content wise) when it is bringing new ways of looking at previous conflicts in history. When I looked at information about a Cod ww1 there were very mixed emotions from &quot;boring&quot; to &quot;interesting&quot;. While I personally find that the amazing scripted sequences and bigger that life action will bring out a heavy handed anti war message and speak out against the cruelty of chemical warfare and warfare itself, I wanted to know what you the people thought. 
:fffuuu: come what may.

Also if you wish to add any other war ideas for the popular franchise please do. (with an explanation of some sort)</description>

Now they just can’t include the inevitable retreat that follows these charges or else a giant phallus of rage will penetrate their contemptuous posteriors.</p>
