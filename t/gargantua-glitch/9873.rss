    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gargantua-glitch/9873</link>
    <description>So I got up to just before the power up Chapter of the game, and right as Gargantua comes into play killing off the military, Now what happened was I let him do his thang and kill the insensitive pricks, and well he came right up to the door of the hallway I was waiting in, shot his blue ray of death, then just stood there, and wouldn&#39;t move, i could attack him, shoot him ect, to no avail ofcourse, here is a screenshot of me up close with him

And here is one about 5 seconds later after me hitting him and scrolling through my weapons again

I Will admit, whilst it was AMAZING! that he stood there so I could near Jizz over the detail and amazingness of him, It was rather hard moving further through the game with him just chilling right in my way  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Same thing happened to me! I wasn’t sure if it was a bug, if I stood at certain angles then he attacked. He went back to wondering around when I moved back far enough, but as soon as I got close he came straight towards me.</p>
<p>Epic graphics though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Did you try running away? He seems to like starring at you but I found he goes back to wandering about once you leave him a while.</p>
