Obviously, he was a [url=https://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSgMr8-jXI8JCJkjLfqxHZWMBfnXZTzSbofCvVdJ8-34DxW6QxwCjnXqVaP]darkone[/url] and [url=https://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/023/c/1/chaotic_evil_joker_by_4thehorde-d37w8s6.jpg]Jokerine[/url] with him was no laughing matter.

[url=https://www.threadbombing.com/data/media/35/CaptainObvious.jpg]CptObvious[/url] was an [url=https://www.freemovieposters.net/posters/orphan_2009_4623_poster.jpg]Orpheon[/url] born to an alcoholic mother and an [url=https://www.demotivationalposters.org/image/demotivational-poster/small/1109/spongebob-drops-acid-spongebob-drops-acid-demotivational-posters-1315881510.jpg]ac3d[/url] addicted father who was left as a ward of the state at an early age. However, this [url=https://theinspirationroom.com/daily/interactive/2012/1/the-shaving-savant.jpg]Savant[/url] knew that looking smart was only half the battle and since she loved guns the only thing in her way now was her being known as a [url=https://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR8YWiOquqGmgOSKlZ5jkOUb889WIU0lTfcg6y-T7upfDYpwRYhk8EumEGM]bigfan421[/url] miles removed from the last known gun free zone. Life expectancy here was never considered to be on a [url=https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Yg6SZL00jV4/ToDu46uSHyI/AAAAAAAAAk0/FHsvTwreCbQ/s1600/level-playing-field.jpg]Level[/url]  playing field and living with her brother, Hubicorn didn&#39;t make it any easier. The[url=https://www.icecarvingsecrets.com/ics/secrets/Entries/2008/4/20_%E2%80%9CGot_You!%E2%80%9D_close-up_files/DSC_0198-filtered.jpg]Frozen Cham[/url]  eleon  outside on a tree limb was proof enough that this frozen wasteland should not be taken lightly.
 
Her brother spent many an hour on youtube finally finding [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/Hubicon/videos]the one video[/url] he had spent his entire life searching for.  Oddly enough, it was created by some [url=https://www.citizenofthemonth.com/wp-content/images/frink.gif]Nerdguy[/url] he actually knew. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTnVM1qKodQ]Xalener &#39;s youtube video[/url]  had reached epic viewing numbers. but still, he couldn&#39;t seem to connect with those who were actually in[url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/magazine/15-11/st_best]Power[/url].  Leading the list of his  [url=https://everynownzen.wordpress.com/2009/10/25/108-problems/]108Problems[/url]. was that he was a real [url=https://archives.frederatorblogs.com/hero_heights/files/2008/04/smart-alec-copy.jpg]Smat alec[/url]  and the fact that his supposed   [url=https://markc1.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451bb2969e2014e87d2b1b8970d-pi]Awesomeness![/url]existed only in his own tiny little mind. He was blind to the town’s collective indignation towards him even as he opened the [url=https://www.gonemovies.com/www/MyWebFilms/Drama/WizardBewaker.jpg]Door[/url] to his favorite barbeque joint for a once in a lifetime special treat.

[url=https://digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/img/featuredcasts/bbqbob.jpg]BahamutBBob[/url]s had been in business a long time and, prior to opening the restaurant, Bob had worked as a [url=https://diabolicalleague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/goat-box.png]geekofalltrades[/url].at the district’s governmental recycling facility on the outskirts of town. Strange things took place there. It seemed that [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_disappeared_mysteriously]Someonerandm[/url] would simply disappear from that area on a fairly regular basis never to be seen again. Rumor was that Bob made human [url=https://www.sff.net/people/doylemacdonald/d_hoard.htm]gibbelin[/url] and gravy, from those who went missing for the town’s elite, and that they paid nicely for the service. Funny how tales like that get started but stranger things had been known to occur ever since [url=https://old.studentsforbhopal.org/Assets/Images/lovecanal.jpg]DiePoente[/url] Industries had relocated to the area.  Prior to that time, he ran a [url=https://odedran.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/gaming-arcade-tokyo.jpg]gaming[/url] [url=https://frontiersaloon.com/signs/Open365Days.jpg]acade365[/url] days a year but that was so time consuming that he decided to open a diner instead. He had even considered revitalizing his [url=https://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MTz16_zDyP3sh4L_IYuJlw/l.jpg]blue man act[/url] but that was just a dream from his past. He knew that no one would want to see [url=https://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfxpu6nyg91qznvc7o1_500.jpg]Bluemen230[/url] pounds heavier than what they were 10 years ago.
  
Sitting down to eat, he noticed the [url=https://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTTBRJJrUfQ9Wn52YeWFsahjYM3bt1OqAzXSXCI1WAssxFMPFrF5NQAJ-J-9A]suggestive leg[/url] of [url=https://www.geekologie.com/2011/05/12/half-life-scar-healed.jpg]lambda[/url] on the menu but he didn’t have near the amount of money necessary to pay for it as well as the special treat he was here for so, he settled for the inexpensive [url=https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Qg-wYWCfIHE/TkFUZOmKxKI/AAAAAAAAAhA/EJ2fjRBJiS0/s1600/09876-heck.jpg]brot[/url]wurst with [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmG587Nj7ko]wheybags[/url] just so he could splurge on an [url=https://thirdplanetfood.com/tidbits/wp-content/uploads/image/dragon1.jpg]OrderofDragon[/url] fruit for dessert. It was the [url=https://maxeymum.blogspot.com/]Maxey[/url]mum amount he could afford but, having the opportunity to eat a [url=https://popwebgame.com/funny_pic/images/kittyoblagalgh.jpg]Fruit[/url] that the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqhp69whyEE]Mango Assassin[/url] [url=https://farm1.static.flickr.com/28/96695789_59df63fcd2.jpg]bug[/url] hadn&#39;t gotten to was well worth the expense. The problem was that he really didn’t know how to eat it.  perhaps he could ask the [url=https://nicholsoncartoons.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2010-07-21-election-debate-Masterchef-cook-off-600.jpg]Master Chef[/url].

The diner had a big screen TV and South Park was on. You know, he thought, they must have killed [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QRZFlFicB8]k3nny1550[/url] times yet it was still funny every time you saw it. It was borderline [url=https://a2.ec-images.myspacecdn.com/profile01/139/95aa916134e84f0785dd7d5674de61f5/p.jpg]amazingcomedy[/url] and if Bart [url=https://images.wikia.com/simpsons/images/6/65/Bart_Simpson.png]sIMson[/url] would have been on it too then it really would have been something else to see.  [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn6iFw-TkVM]TheBartMan[/url] and Eric Cartman constantly yelling [url=https://www.fitnessgurusam.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ot-young-hooligan-1.jpg]“Scrue you”[/url] gave a familiarity to the show that true fans looked forward to hearing and that was something they really relished.
 
The show was being allowed to be seen in China for the first time this year and it was a huge success. They made simple alterations to make it more appealing like changing the architecture a little and changing Eric Cartman’s name to [url=https://southparkstudios.mtvnimages.com/shared/downloads/images/season-12/1208/1208_butters-cartman-chinese-outfits.jpg]Eric Fong[/url]. There was something else different about him too but no one could seem to put their finger on exactly what it was.

The show he was watching was suddenly interrupted by a breaking news story.
 
A [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkzMtzHni_0]Mr.Night[/url], wearing a [url=https://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/9971402/2/stock-illustration-9971402-man-in-hazmat-suit-handeling-something-radioactive.jpg]Hazzmat[/url] suit over an ill fitting [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUd9tyLGDo]Blevar[/url] vest, was being interviewed and spoke of the reappearance of a crazed religious zealot named David [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koresh]Keresh[/url] . Apparently, he had escaped death in the Waco fire with what he considered a gift from God in the form of unusual [url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3972138/Tatts-amazing-Man-has-dolphin-tattooed-on-his-stump.html]ManlyStump[/url] left as a reminder of his special purpose here on earth.  It looked like [url=https://www.worldwidewounds.com/2002/october/Bowley/images/www9.jpg](rot)(fodder[/url] and was [url=https://beyondlimited.com/]beyondltd[/url] recognition as an arm until he was instructed by God to get a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjlxrwNlZrk]Medkit[/url] and dress it up as a dolphin.  The pain in doing it was so severe, he would [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we9_CdNPuJg]blackout[/url] multiple times prior to its completion but, it was God’s will and he knew he had to finish it. He had been [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdSLP-qz_fw]Winged One[/url]time during the Waco siege but, it simply didn&#39;t compare to the pain he was suffering through for this.
 
His escape from death was accomplished by locating a modified [url=https://wahzm.hvmce.servertrust.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/eureka/4700d.jpg]Disturbulator[/url] while the federal occupation of the compound was taking place. He had live life as a [url=https://www.cracked.com/funny-5332-hobo-facts/]bobbo[/url] while on the run with [url=https://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/270016/april-07-2010/tiki-barber-cheats-on-his-wife]ComradeTiki[/url] Barber who had been accused of domestic violence by his wife.  Oddly enough, Tiki’s defense was that he would only [url=https://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQKyBxHTxUTk8_ew_CZdaf2ZmtWsl_PTlDqnn6XdyGqRo_62pZxCulOy8u-cg]striker[/url] when she truly deserved it so, he shouldn’t be found guilty. Obviously, this didn’t go over well with the jury.
 
His current [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RCygC5Z8cU]Collision[/url] with the law was brought about when his ankle monitor revealed a [url=https://www.photius.com/wfb2001/airport_codes_alpha.html]CTID[/url] that showed him to be in proximity to the police’s current search for a missing [url=https://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/lind-combine-demolition-derby/lind-combine-demolition-derby.jpg]Combine[/url] stolen from a demolition derby. They were being forced now to rely on [url=https://art.ngfiles.com/images/86/ixintro_dr-strangelove.jpg]Dr. Strangelove[/url]’s sister Tranta who actually more resembled Santa Clause than she did [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdVivT0ShC4]The Doctor[/url] himself. Unfortunately, [url=https://www.loupiote.com/photos_m/5233662200-santa-claus-drag-queen-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-san-francisco.jpg]TrantaLocked[/url] her keys in the getaway car so she was having to use her [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=904erau8z_M]Android11x[/url] to try and reach help. She switched the heavily modified system on but, since the device had its signal boosted eleven fold,  it showed up on regulatory monitors with a [url=https://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16100000/Limit-Break-fighting-for-freedom-16126321-600-450.jpg]LimitBreak[/url]ing output equal to that of [url=https://image.hotrod.com/f/12072369+w750+st0/hrdp_0809_26_z+vintage_funny_car_racing+super_nova.jpg]TheSuperNova[/url] of 1969. The [url=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Dju_Y1_IR-g/TYJ2Q3srakI/AAAAAAAAIRE/E5fz-hOhy_s/Location+Trigger+Guide.png]Trigger_Proximity[/url] of the device was immediately set off and quickly gave their positions away. Now they were all done for. A dangerous [url=https://www.braingell.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/COVER-shotLores.jpg]Solokiller[/url] [url=https://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_le98vqyYIb1qbd84ho1_500.jpg]SassyRobot[/url] exterminator was on its way.
 
The situation continued to unfold on the television as dessert arrived. Paying the [url=https://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/arsgera/arsgera1001/arsgera100100101/6268387-money-of-the-world--dollars-euros-russian-roubles.jpg]Nightmare470[/url] credits for it was something that he knew he could never afford to do again. He remembered once having to admit &quot;[url=https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pQaIq8XNL._SS500_.jpg]Mabilis[/url] more than I&#39;ve got on me&quot; to the owner and he ended up having to wash dishes but, this time a glass of [url=https://www.touristinformationcentres.net/webshop/images/webshop/207/product/large/Clos-Mont-Blanc-Syrah.jpg]Mont_Blanc[/url] followed by a shot of [url=https://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/3/27/98cb319a-9cda-4733-9e25-9c936f185968.jpg]Jack Freeman[/url] would go a long ways in helping him to ignore the financial pain.Now,  [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh723yoCboE]If only he could figure out exactly how to eat it.[/url]
 
He soon learned that he really should have asked for expert help or at least found a video somewhere on how to do it properly. Taking a bite of his dessert led to a desperate situation. Fortunately, [url=https://www.demotivationalposters.org/image/demotivational-poster/1004/everyone-chill-the-f-out-whats-up-doc-demotivational-poster-1270839304.jpg]calhoun freeman[/url], sitting in the next booth, noticed his difficulties and sprang from his seat yelling “Everyone chill the f**k out, I got this!” [url=https://images.spirithalloween.com/images/spirit/products/processed/00184861.zoom.a.jpg]Luciel[/url], the waitress who had served him the dish, quickly joined in to help in the rescue. Removing the fruit with the help of an oddly shaped [url=https://www.gadgetskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/weird-spoon.png]RandomSpoon[/url] grabbed from the table resulted in a quick fix to the dangerous situation. 

[url=https://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQVWEILKoz-r2DnLvPhEmirEmADyjwWrc4zZgVfM7YrOHW4d-dFLjir728_]Hubicorn[/url] was breathing again but was convinced this had to be some type of [url=https://i55.tinypic.com/4kdv6.jpg]conspiracy[/url] to do him in. He never figured that anyone actually had the knowledge of his involvement with the truck accident in the first place nor that anyone would have the courage to do anything about it even if they did. 

He knew he must be more careful in the future. After all, he did know one thing for sure and that was that True [url=https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpfhsh2Tsl1qafrh6.png]Awesomeness![/url] would always prevail!

Don’t believe it?

<p>Her brother spent many an hour on youtube finally finding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Hubicon/videos" data-bbcode="true">the one video</a> he had spent his entire life searching for.  Oddly enough, it was created by some <a href="https://www.citizenofthemonth.com/wp-content/images/frink.gif" data-bbcode="true">Nerdguy</a> he actually knew. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTnVM1qKodQ" data-bbcode="true">Xalener 's youtube video</a>  had reached epic viewing numbers. but still, he couldn’t seem to connect with those who were actually in<a href="https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/magazine/15-11/st_best" data-bbcode="true">Power</a>.  Leading the list of his  <a href="https://everynownzen.wordpress.com/2009/10/25/108-problems/" data-bbcode="true">108Problems</a>. was that he was a real <a href="https://archives.frederatorblogs.com/hero_heights/files/2008/04/smart-alec-copy.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Smat alec</a>  and the fact that his supposed   <a href="https://markc1.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451bb2969e2014e87d2b1b8970d-pi" data-bbcode="true">Awesomeness!</a>existed only in his own tiny little mind. He was blind to the town’s collective indignation towards him even as he opened the <a href="https://www.gonemovies.com/www/MyWebFilms/Drama/WizardBewaker.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Door</a> to his favorite barbeque joint for a once in a lifetime special treat.</p>
<p><a href="https://digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/img/featuredcasts/bbqbob.jpg" data-bbcode="true">BahamutBBob</a>s had been in business a long time and, prior to opening the restaurant, Bob had worked as a <a href="https://diabolicalleague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/goat-box.png" data-bbcode="true">geekofalltrades</a>.at the district’s governmental recycling facility on the outskirts of town. Strange things took place there. It seemed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_disappeared_mysteriously" data-bbcode="true">Someonerandm</a> would simply disappear from that area on a fairly regular basis never to be seen again. Rumor was that Bob made human <a href="https://www.sff.net/people/doylemacdonald/d_hoard.htm" data-bbcode="true">gibbelin</a> and gravy, from those who went missing for the town’s elite, and that they paid nicely for the service. Funny how tales like that get started but stranger things had been known to occur ever since <a href="https://old.studentsforbhopal.org/Assets/Images/lovecanal.jpg" data-bbcode="true">DiePoente</a> Industries had relocated to the area.  Prior to that time, he ran a <a href="https://odedran.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/gaming-arcade-tokyo.jpg" data-bbcode="true">gaming</a> <a href="https://frontiersaloon.com/signs/Open365Days.jpg" data-bbcode="true">acade365</a> days a year but that was so time consuming that he decided to open a diner instead. He had even considered revitalizing his <a href="https://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MTz16_zDyP3sh4L_IYuJlw/l.jpg" data-bbcode="true">blue man act</a> but that was just a dream from his past. He knew that no one would want to see <a href="https://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfxpu6nyg91qznvc7o1_500.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Bluemen230</a> pounds heavier than what they were 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Sitting down to eat, he noticed the <a href="https://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTTBRJJrUfQ9Wn52YeWFsahjYM3bt1OqAzXSXCI1WAssxFMPFrF5NQAJ-J-9A" data-bbcode="true">suggestive leg</a> of <a href="https://www.geekologie.com/2011/05/12/half-life-scar-healed.jpg" data-bbcode="true">lambda</a> on the menu but he didn’t have near the amount of money necessary to pay for it as well as the special treat he was here for so, he settled for the inexpensive <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Qg-wYWCfIHE/TkFUZOmKxKI/AAAAAAAAAhA/EJ2fjRBJiS0/s1600/09876-heck.jpg" data-bbcode="true">brot</a>wurst with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmG587Nj7ko" data-bbcode="true">wheybags</a> just so he could splurge on an <a href="https://thirdplanetfood.com/tidbits/wp-content/uploads/image/dragon1.jpg" data-bbcode="true">OrderofDragon</a> fruit for dessert. It was the <a href="https://maxeymum.blogspot.com/" data-bbcode="true">Maxey</a>mum amount he could afford but, having the opportunity to eat a <a href="https://popwebgame.com/funny_pic/images/kittyoblagalgh.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Fruit</a> that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqhp69whyEE" data-bbcode="true">Mango Assassin</a> <a href="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/28/96695789_59df63fcd2.jpg" data-bbcode="true">bug</a> hadn’t gotten to was well worth the expense. The problem was that he really didn’t know how to eat it.  perhaps he could ask the <a href="https://nicholsoncartoons.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2010-07-21-election-debate-Masterchef-cook-off-600.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Master Chef</a>.</p>
<p>The diner had a big screen TV and South Park was on. You know, he thought, they must have killed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QRZFlFicB8" data-bbcode="true">k3nny1550</a> times yet it was still funny every time you saw it. It was borderline <a href="https://a2.ec-images.myspacecdn.com/profile01/139/95aa916134e84f0785dd7d5674de61f5/p.jpg" data-bbcode="true">amazingcomedy</a> and if Bart <a href="https://images.wikia.com/simpsons/images/6/65/Bart_Simpson.png" data-bbcode="true">sIMson</a> would have been on it too then it really would have been something else to see.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn6iFw-TkVM" data-bbcode="true">TheBartMan</a> and Eric Cartman constantly yelling <a href="https://www.fitnessgurusam.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ot-young-hooligan-1.jpg" data-bbcode="true">“Scrue you”</a> gave a familiarity to the show that true fans looked forward to hearing and that was something they really relished.</p>
<p>The show was being allowed to be seen in China for the first time this year and it was a huge success. They made simple alterations to make it more appealing like changing the architecture a little and changing Eric Cartman’s name to <a href="https://southparkstudios.mtvnimages.com/shared/downloads/images/season-12/1208/1208_butters-cartman-chinese-outfits.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Eric Fong</a>. There was something else different about him too but no one could seem to put their finger on exactly what it was.</p>
<p>The show he was watching was suddenly interrupted by a breaking news story.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkzMtzHni_0" data-bbcode="true">Mr.Night</a>, wearing a <a href="https://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/9971402/2/stock-illustration-9971402-man-in-hazmat-suit-handeling-something-radioactive.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Hazzmat</a> suit over an ill fitting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXUd9tyLGDo" data-bbcode="true">Blevar</a> vest, was being interviewed and spoke of the reappearance of a crazed religious zealot named David <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koresh" data-bbcode="true">Keresh</a> . Apparently, he had escaped death in the Waco fire with what he considered a gift from God in the form of unusual <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3972138/Tatts-amazing-Man-has-dolphin-tattooed-on-his-stump.html" data-bbcode="true">ManlyStump</a> left as a reminder of his special purpose here on earth.  It looked like <a>url=https://www.worldwidewounds.com/2002/october/Bowley/images/www9.jpg</a>(fodder[/url] and was <a href="https://beyondlimited.com/" data-bbcode="true">beyondltd</a> recognition as an arm until he was instructed by God to get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjlxrwNlZrk" data-bbcode="true">Medkit</a> and dress it up as a dolphin.  The pain in doing it was so severe, he would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we9_CdNPuJg" data-bbcode="true">blackout</a> multiple times prior to its completion but, it was God’s will and he knew he had to finish it. He had been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdSLP-qz_fw" data-bbcode="true">Winged One</a>time during the Waco siege but, it simply didn’t compare to the pain he was suffering through for this.</p>
<p>His escape from death was accomplished by locating a modified <a href="https://wahzm.hvmce.servertrust.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/eureka/4700d.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Disturbulator</a> while the federal occupation of the compound was taking place. He had live life as a <a href="https://www.cracked.com/funny-5332-hobo-facts/" data-bbcode="true">bobbo</a> while on the run with <a href="https://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/270016/april-07-2010/tiki-barber-cheats-on-his-wife" data-bbcode="true">ComradeTiki</a> Barber who had been accused of domestic violence by his wife.  Oddly enough, Tiki’s defense was that he would only <a href="https://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQKyBxHTxUTk8_ew_CZdaf2ZmtWsl_PTlDqnn6XdyGqRo_62pZxCulOy8u-cg" data-bbcode="true">striker</a> when she truly deserved it so, he shouldn’t be found guilty. Obviously, this didn’t go over well with the jury.</p>
<p>His current <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RCygC5Z8cU" data-bbcode="true">Collision</a> with the law was brought about when his ankle monitor revealed a <a href="https://www.photius.com/wfb2001/airport_codes_alpha.html" data-bbcode="true">CTID</a> that showed him to be in proximity to the police’s current search for a missing <a href="https://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/lind-combine-demolition-derby/lind-combine-demolition-derby.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Combine</a> stolen from a demolition derby. They were being forced now to rely on <a href="https://art.ngfiles.com/images/86/ixintro_dr-strangelove.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Dr. Strangelove</a>’s sister Tranta who actually more resembled Santa Clause than she did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdVivT0ShC4" data-bbcode="true">The Doctor</a> himself. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.loupiote.com/photos_m/5233662200-santa-claus-drag-queen-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-san-francisco.jpg" data-bbcode="true">TrantaLocked</a> her keys in the getaway car so she was having to use her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=904erau8z_M" data-bbcode="true">Android11x</a> to try and reach help. She switched the heavily modified system on but, since the device had its signal boosted eleven fold,  it showed up on regulatory monitors with a <a href="https://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16100000/Limit-Break-fighting-for-freedom-16126321-600-450.jpg" data-bbcode="true">LimitBreak</a>ing output equal to that of <a href="https://image.hotrod.com/f/12072369+w750+st0/hrdp_0809_26_z+vintage_funny_car_racing+super_nova.jpg" data-bbcode="true">TheSuperNova</a> of 1969.

Now they were all done for. A dangerous <a href="https://www.braingell.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/COVER-shotLores.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Solokiller</a> <a href="https://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_le98vqyYIb1qbd84ho1_500.jpg" data-bbcode="true">SassyRobot</a> exterminator was on its way.</p>
<p>The situation continued to unfold on the television as dessert arrived. Paying the <a href="https://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/arsgera/arsgera1001/arsgera100100101/6268387-money-of-the-world--dollars-euros-russian-roubles.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Nightmare470</a> credits for it was something that he knew he could never afford to do again. He remembered once having to admit “<a href="https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pQaIq8XNL._SS500_.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Mabilis</a> more than I’ve got on me” to the owner and he ended up having to wash dishes but, this time a glass of <a href="https://www.touristinformationcentres.net/webshop/images/webshop/207/product/large/Clos-Mont-Blanc-Syrah.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Mont_Blanc</a> followed by a shot of <a href="https://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/3/27/98cb319a-9cda-4733-9e25-9c936f185968.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Jack Freeman</a> would go a long ways in helping him to ignore the financial pain.Now,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh723yoCboE" data-bbcode="true">If only he could figure out exactly how to eat it.</a></p>
<p>He soon learned that he really should have asked for expert help or at least found a video somewhere on how to do it properly. Taking a bite of his dessert led to a desperate situation. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.demotivationalposters.org/image/demotivational-poster/1004/everyone-chill-the-f-out-whats-up-doc-demotivational-poster-1270839304.jpg" data-bbcode="true">calhoun freeman</a>, sitting in the next booth, noticed his difficulties and sprang from his seat yelling “Everyone chill the f**k out, I got this!” <a href="https://images.spirithalloween.com/images/spirit/products/processed/00184861.zoom.a.jpg" data-bbcode="true">Luciel</a>, the waitress who had served him the dish, quickly joined in to help in the rescue. Removing the fruit with the help of an oddly shaped <a href="https://www.gadgetskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/weird-spoon.png" data-bbcode="true">RandomSpoon</a> grabbed from the table resulted in a quick fix to the dangerous situation.</p>

He never figured that anyone actually had the knowledge of his involvement with the truck accident in the first place nor that anyone would have the courage to do anything about it even if they did.</p>
<p>He knew he must be more careful in the future. After all, he did know one thing for sure and that was that True <a href="https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpfhsh2Tsl1qafrh6.png" data-bbcode="true">Awesomeness!</a> would always prevail!</p>
