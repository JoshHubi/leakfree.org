    <title>Nvidia Inspector</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/nvidia-inspector/9341</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m trying to use Nvidia Inspector to force AA in Crysis 2 but it doesn&#39;t seem to work. I&#39;m using a string that I found in a thread about the tool and did what they said but it&#39;s still not working. Is it caused because I&#39;m playing in DX11 mode instead of DX9? I thought that DX11 had better AA compatibility that DX9 did. So yeah, could anyone that knows how to use this program help? I&#39;m trying to use SGSSAA.</description>
