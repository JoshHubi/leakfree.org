    <title>What happened to not releasing the MOD until it&#39;s perfect?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-happened-to-not-releasing-the-mod-until-its-perfect/11333</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure you guys remember the devs excuse for taking so long with finishing the mod because they &quot;wanted to make it perfect&quot;.  While the mod definitely exceeded my expectations in visuals, it&#39;s pretty obvious that it&#39;s far from perfect and a couple runs through the game play testing can make these faults glaringly visible.  I&#39;m not going to get into the faults of the game like the balance and jumping issues because those are easily fixable.  But shouldn&#39;t these things of been fixed before release if we were truly waiting so long because they were &quot;perfecting&quot; the mod?

Xen.  Totally missing?  That&#39;s a pretty far cry from perfect.  Let&#39;s just hope it doesn&#39;t take another 8 years for them to release Xen.  Going through another thread of Xen maps made by ONE user it shouldnt take very long for a team to finish. 

Moral of the story, hey devs if you&#39;re going to take another 8 years to finish making Xen that&#39;s fine.  Just don&#39;t BS us lame excuses like your &quot;perfecting&quot; it.  The game is really good so far... it would be a shame to not finish it.</description>

<p>While i get your point, please don’t bother us with that AGAIN. Not bitching or anything, but we’ve been all through this in the beginning of the thread, ok ? I’ll admit that the Source AI isn’t state of the art, even if the Devs improved it (and they improved it hell a lot !), but you only have this AI and if your tactic doesn’t work on hard, change it, change the conditions (cvars!) or change the difficulty. Simple as that. Or you can programm your own AI if you wish. Just my 2 cents…</p>

<p>Of course it is! The next release won’t take place in Black Mesa will it? It’s called Black Mesa because that’s what it is  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The only issue I had with the HECU is that they were too sourcy. The stiff movement from point to point, the auto lock on, the not-reacting-to-pain, all of that. It did make it more difficult, but that wasn’t my issue. It made it feel kinda wrong. Like, I’d be sucked into the game with the amazing voice acting and audio and visuals, then these floating torsos darting from point to point dragging legs behind them would show up emptying mags perfectly into my chest within a trillianth of a second of seeing me. Either that, or they’d stare at me for 13 seconds, run over to the wrong side of cover, start to fire, change their mind, and run back to where they were before and proceed to empty into me.</span> The melee only enemies weren’t too bad, but you know.

<p>Basically all he has to do is get high res textures in place and it will be just like black mesa.  All the hard work like entity tweaking is done.  I think this is a valid point.  Hell he even made a model for the gonarch in like a day.  Making the actual structure of levels is pretty easy.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Except no. <span class="bbcode-i">All</span> of my no. The geometry is still insanely blocky, and a simple retexture wouldn’t bring it to be “just like Black Mesa.” The Black Mesa devs are reimagining Xen, that’s why it’s taking longer. It’s a terrible point. And his Gonarch was a brush based, and off of <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/images//5/54/Test_gonarch0000.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">something the devs did looooong ago.</a><br>
It’s funny, a lot of his work is based around what he has <span class="bbcode-i">from Black Mesa</span> to work with.</p>

<p>What about when valve releases a new engine that competes with battlefield 3?  We will all be wanting a HL1 remake on that engine won’t we?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why? Black Mesa’s out, why would you want yet another remake? I’d welcome people trying to reimagine Half-Life again, but someone else’s attempts are entirely irrelevant to Black Mesa. As I said before, they’re bringing it to Source, not 2012. If someone else wants to try reimagine Half-Life and bring it to 2012 in a way Black Mesa didn’t and isn’t Simply Half-Life with hires textures that’s their business, and it doesn’t matter here.</p>

<p>If someone wanted to put Wolfenstein 3D on GoldSrc no one would even mention the dated graphics, but for some reason (seemingly because the game looks so good) a lot of people seem to think it should compete with freakin’ Battlefield 3 or some other new FPS. This is completely irrelevant to anything here at all.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Again, I wish those <span class="bbcode-i">lucky bastards</span> luck with that, but it doesn’t matter here. Half-Life has almost all of it’s glory and that bastards almost 14. Black Mesa came out just a month ago, isn’t supposed to be top of the line, and you think it matter whether someone else will redo it in the future? All I can say about that, if I may speak freely, is <span class="bbcode-i">who the hell gives a fuck?</span> I don’t think Valve batted an eye at thinking someone might remake Half-Life: Source when they released it along with the Source SDK. The Black Mesa team released an amazing game, and they’re supposed to worry about the (highly unlikely) possibility that someone else will go and do it, too?</p>
<p>So yeah, unless you bring up another ridiculous point so ludicrous that the impulse to respond beats me, I think I’m done here, as it’s clear you won’t listen to reason. I absolutely <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">hate</span></span> to resort to this old, overused response, but it fits too perfectly: If you think it’s all so easy, I suggest you try taking a crack at it at least, yourself, and prove what you say. Designing levels, programming, modeling, 2D art, voice work, animation, <span class="bbcode-i">managing 40 people</span>, writing, etc. is not easy and takes time.</p>

<p>The mods should really hire that guy who is making Xen levels in the other thread.  I’m impresed with what he accomplished in like 1 week time. I think we can all agree the devs obviously didnt have the time/man power to work as quick as they could of the last 8 years(it’s a free product so I’m not going to say they were lazy).  Ughh I just really don’t want to wait another 8 years for the actual completed “perfected” product, because judging on the BETA version the mods potential is huge.  But let’s face it the technology is already dated, it needs to be completed as fast as possible to still be as relevant as the mod deserves to be.</p>

<p>I certainly don’t recall the developers ever saying that the mod was being delayed until it was perfect. Stop focusing on whatever implications you’re drawing from that, it just sounds like you’re projecting your frustration with the development process.</p>

<p>What about when valve releases a new engine that competes with battlefield 3?  We will all be wanting a HL1 remake on that engine won’t we?  The longer it takes for this mod to come out on the current engine, the less time for glory it will have before someone comes along and makes black mesa on a newer engine.  It will happen.</p>

<p>Of course it is! The next release won’t take place in Black Mesa will it? It’s called Black Mesa because that’s what it is  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>The only issue I had with the HECU is that they were too sourcy. The stiff movement from point to point, the auto lock on, the not-reacting-to-pain, all of that. It did make it more difficult, but that wasn’t my issue. It made it feel kinda wrong. Like, I’d be sucked into the game with the amazing voice acting and audio and visuals, then these floating torsos darting from point to point dragging legs behind them would show up emptying mags perfectly into my chest within a trillianth of a second of seeing me. Either that, or they’d stare at me for 13 seconds, run over to the wrong side of cover, start to fire, change their mind, and run back to where they were before and proceed to empty into me. The melee only enemies weren’t too bad, but you know. They’re them.</p>

            <p>I don’t think there are as many issues with the game as the OP says. For me, 95% of it is pretty much perfect, while there are some awkward scenes and in some cases not so great voice acting. However, these don’t take away from the overall sense that the game is pretty close to being perfect.</p>
<p>The lack of Xen, in my opinion, is not an issue at this point. We will see how long it takes. If it doesn’t take too long and it’s as good as the rest of the game, it was definitely worth it.</p>
<p>You’re kind of suggesting that they should only have released when it’s perfect, i.e. when Xen is finished. That would just delay the whole release. At least we get to play a huge chunk of the game while we wait for Xen, rather than waiting without anything to play!</p>

<p>You seem to be under the impression that those Xen levels are actually new maps? They’re just the maps from Half-life: Source ported into Black Mesa, dude. It doesn’t take a huge amount of effort to port maps. It takes a lot more to design and create maps from scratch though.<br>
So stop comparing BM to that Xen thread.</p>
<p>And no, it won’t take another eight years for Xen to come out, that’s completely ridiculous. It will be released sometime next year.</p>

            <p>Presumably by releasing the majority of the game without Xen the developers were able to alleviate the pressure put on them by the community, providing more time to complete these levels at a desired level of quality. Most likely the AI will be tweaked slightly given the  feedback, and crouch-jumping may become optional. OP may be slightly exaggerating his frustration for the sake of emphasis; I find it hard to believe that a person could derive so much angst from a privilege as if it were an insult.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding balance issues: there’s been feedback regarding various balance issues. Some of these seem valid, and some just seem like “the game was too hard!”. The devs take feedback seriously and I suspect they’ll make any tweaks they feel are necessary. I also suspect that they didn’t feel that these were issues before they released the game, and that they were satisfied with the balances they had.</p>
<p>In general, though, I think a lot of the feedback about enemy balancing and difficult combat is really just from people who are less-skilled players, and I think the obvious solution there is to play the game on easy difficulty until you can develop better gaming skills. I think it would be a different case if everyone or nearly everyone had these issues, but that’s not the case.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can agree mostly with that, though there are valid complaints regarding the balance issues and this is coming from a big Half-Life fan. Its comes down to little touches in gameplay balance that can makes the game either more fun or more frustrating. For now, Black Mesa is instantly more fun than hard, though there are some hair-pulling moments.</p>
<p>About the enemies… making the Soldiers, Houndeyes, and Bullsquids harder to combat are the strokes of genius and made the game enjoyably harder. However, they’re perhaps tad to difficult even in the Normal settings, especially with the Soldiers gaining some superhuman powers. You can put the original Normal difficulty to Hard since Soldiers in Normal difficulty are already notoriously hard already. That’s goes for the Assassins, too.</p>
<p>Houndeyes from original Half-Life are sluggishly slow with their attacks and your team did the right thing by making them attack faster, yet they seems to be too insanely fast this time in Black Mesa. Kinda frustrating trying to deal with large pack of them in Normal setting. The neat solution to this would be to keep their quick blast attack intact in Hard mode while adding maybe a second or two for Normal and Easy. That would throw the players off guard by their discrepancy in difference between charge times.</p>
<p>About Bullsquid… well nothing bad to talk about, gameplay-wise. I like that the team added the spit attack from Antlion Guard of Half-Life 2 series. That made them more scary and dangerous than the pathetic version in original Halif-Life. Headcrabs, Headcrab Zombies, Barnacles are pretty much hard as what I expected to be and that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>Now about the Voltigrunts, they seems to be too easy to combat this time around, whatever it is due to their health level being bit low or whatever our weapons are slightly overpowered. I did like that their Lightning attacks are faster, even if they’re bit on the weak side. Before you guys jump on me about complaining about Houndeyes attacking too fast and praising for Voltigrunts attacking too fast, keep this in mind: You can dodge Voltigrunts’ attack easily without damage if you can react fast enough. You barely can with Houndeyes unless you run to minimum safe distance in time (which rarely happen) or shoot it dead fast enough.</p>
<p>About the Alien Grunts… I like that they’re much harder this time like the Soldiers. Part of me like that their cool weapons can definitely home toward you faster this time and have more punch, though part of me hate that they can kill you faster. At least, they have far less appearances than the Soldiers so the players would know that Alien Grunts are something to be seriously dealt with since they ARE and SHOULD be harder to deal with than the Human Soldiers. I would leave their values alone.</p>
<p>Alien Controllers? Much better this time around, too.</p>
<p>My two cents.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The same applies to crouch-jumping. Some players tweak the values to make it easier, some players didn’t like it at all. I had absolutely no problem with it. The default values were fine. The people that complained about crouch-jumping are clearly not fans of Half-Life. This is more an issue of some people lacking gaming skill, not a problem with the game. Learn to jump, it’s not difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I disagree and I am a Half-Life fan and I am used to crouch jumping. What frustrate me about it is that I have to constantly use it to jump not over a fence or box or even a table, but over the smallest of ledges and debris. Encountering it often left me wonder whatever Freeman has such a stubby pair of legs. This break the illusion of realism and is very distracting time and time again.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Most commercial games attempt to flatten the skill curve in order to make the games more enjoyable for a wider audience with a greater range of skill levels. If Black Mesa was a commercial game that sought to appeal to the largest demographic range possible, then it would be expected that the developers would compromise to the abilities and intelligences of the left of the the skill curve. But the great thing about Black Mesa being a free mod is that they don’t have to do that - they can make the game they want to make, without having to compromise to the demands of demographic segments. They don’t have to dumb it down too much.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I understand where you’re coming with this, but I am not sure if I can agree with it. Some players don’t like that they have to go straight into the coding and tweak it themselves. Heck, I don’t either. Heck again, some people aren’t even good with this sort of thing and it wouldn’t be fair to tell them to do it so, even if this is a free mod.</p>
<p>Then again, I have to agree that since this is a free mod, your team have the final say and there’s nothing we can do about it to change your mind… unless we go in and change those values by ourselves  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Alright, I had something wrote up but after re-reading it, I sounded like a complete asshole so in an effort to keep the mods from beating me with hammers…this is my reply…version TWO!</p>
<p>Your opening post struck me immediately with the thought  “Dude, the Devs have been saying for awhile now that Xen will be released later, why can no one read?!” but I rethought it through and decided that you were just puzzled that it couldn’t be released all at once.  As I see it…it is better to release it, let people play, let them discover things that need fixed, correct them, and then patch it up.  Rather than holding out on a release because you keep wanting to tweak things and can’t decide if it is a certain way.</p>
<p>I have been waiting for this mod for 8 years and I am very impressed with it.  Sure there are things here and there that aren’t perfect, but it is up to us (The players/gamers/nerds/developers/etc) to play through this and find out the imperfections.  Then the developers can correct things to a degree.  I am unsure how they will tweak some of the difficulty curves that some players are struggling with, but I know they will not abandon us.  Just wait until Xen is released and we will see if it makes up for some of the things that made us pull our hair out(if you have hair, that is).</p>
<p>Peace</p>
<p>EDIT - If you are talking about the one man person doing Xen as being dky.tehkingd.u   then I really hope you realize that Xen is basically exactly how it was in HL1…not Black Mesa’ed.</p>

            <p>I don’t have any reason to believe the devs were/are not working as hard as they could (or had the resources/time to do so) for the past years. I’m sure the goal was and still is to perfect the mod before releasing something, but like almost everyone has stressed it’s not possible to work 24/7 on a mod, and it already sort of a great accomplishment to manage to work on this for 8 years. Real life always gets priority, and most of the time can be a reason to drop the development completely for months.</p>
<p>Also after a few years the initial enthusiasm diminishes, especially when the starting challenge of producing something new/exciting is lost and you are stuck with closed beta testing (this is a most awful process in a mod for the simplest of reasons- few take it seriously, and the feedback can be sometimes of low quality) and bug fixing what is a Total Conversion mod of the size of a full PC game title. And of course your (volunteering) team can’t always be available and/or on stand-by.</p>
<p>So if you are an absolute perfectionist mod developer, you are pretty much screwed at this point. They chose to release the main portion of the game when it was perfect enough for them (and it’s very easy to understand that this mod has been iteratively polished for some time) and it was a smart decision. Yet, I’m sure that the main motivation always remained “release when it’s perfect” throughout the development. (I am also sure that getting more than one people/team members all to agree that something is perfect is not an easy feat).</p>
<p>We got a very polished mod which plays great (personally I have had no problems with jumping or the weapon/enemy balancing, and have yet to experience a single crash).</p>
<p>And Xen can wait. Basically, it puzzles me that more people are not realizing that the devs have to be very devoted to this mod if they are going to spend more of their free personal time (after eight years of doing so -no less) to redesign and develop… Xen?!</p>

<p>I would suggest reading <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Making_a_Mod" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> article by Valve.  It explains the mod creation cycle from start-to-finish, from Valve’s perspective.  The article is more geared towards multiplayer mods, but the ideas are the same.</p>

<p>That only really applies to agilist projects, though, not waterfall ones- and a ‘when it’s done’ approach is about as waterfall as it gets. If BM had been a true agile project then it would have provided nightly builds.</p>
<p>Not that I think agile works well for these sorts of projects, mind.</p>

            <p>The mods should really hire that guy who is making Xen levels in the other thread.  I’m impresed with what he accomplished in like 1 week time. I think we can all agree the devs obviously didnt have the time/man power to work as quick as they could of the last 8 years(it’s a free product so I’m not going to say they were lazy).  Ughh I just really don’t want to wait another 8 years for the actual completed “perfected” product, because judging on the BETA version the mods potential is huge.  But let’s face it the technology is already dated, it needs to be completed as fast as possible to still be as relevant as the mod deserves to be.</p>
