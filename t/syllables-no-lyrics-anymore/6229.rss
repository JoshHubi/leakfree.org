    <title>Syllables : No lyrics anymore?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/syllables-no-lyrics-anymore/6229</link>
    <description>29 Dec 2010
Featuring with Jay-Z, Dr.Dre, and another three guys, Eminem has just released his new rap song, [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OItVX424gJY&#39;]&#39;Syllables.&#39;[/url]

I wouldn&#39;t be gotta describe the lyrics. But put them here:
[QUOTE=Eminem]
[Talking]
[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;]It is not about lyrics anymore,
its about a hot beat,
and a catchy hook

[Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
then so be it
cause nowadays these kids, jeez
don&#39;t give a shit bout lyrics
all they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
long as they can go to the club and get blitz
pick up some chicks and get some digits
and the DJ&#39;s playing them hits
oh this my jam, this my sh-t
[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;]we dont know a word to a verse,
all we know is the chorus
cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
and the songs ginormous, the whole formula&#39;s switched
cause we don&#39;t know anymore, what are hits
is it the beat, is it the rap
is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;]and how do we adapt and get TRL votes
when 13 year olds control the remote
and Ashley&#39;s got a brand new nose
we gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables

[Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc isn&#39;t the beat
than I&#39;m gon feature EM and get rich
and let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
bang bang look at the way my chain glow
the ring on my fing&#39; cost Jermaine a lot of dough, oh
the f-ck am I busting my brain for?
its just the way the game go, oh, it takes 2 to tango
you call this a lame flow
you bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
no more reality flow
I&#39;m tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
and call my publicist tell her we impressed heaven
[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;]no one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
so you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable

[Dr Dre]
They said 30?s the new 20
funny, must mean 40?s the new 30
interesting cause ever since then it&#39;s been innocence
an extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
of the shit coming out right now
its all trash
the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it&#39;s his last and 50 and Em
then what? Detox drops what we got then
[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;]so now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
gambling everytime we put a record out
just looking for that hook

[Eminem]
[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;](Wait Dre look)
Shorty I love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be cause shorty
you love me
and I love you too
and I promise I&#39;ll be true to you

[50 Cent]
Go shorty, its your birthday
you made it just in time to hear my wordplay
its the kid that flip flows who used to flip O&#39;s
and run G for days used to see how I get hoes

I&#39;m international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I&#39;m sick right into show, riding on lolo&#39;s
puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo&#39;s
don&#39;t f-ck with the dodo&#39;s, I sling for dumb hoes
I playing, I aint got time to joke, joke
you f-ck around, you could get your ass smoked
look, its not a game, me B, I aint playing
beep behind me player, so you here anyway
[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;]you don&#39;t hear what I&#39;m saying
me fin-nini-na
fee-fi-dididee-yay
just give me my check and I&#39;ll be on my way
sunny bunny money and funny
you aint even listening and I just took your money

[Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere he turned
shady aftermath was all ya heard
but they say 50 sang too much
and Em got soft
and they say Dre just fell the f-ck off
well f-ck the f-ck offs
all y&#39;all eat soft, be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!
new syllables eat ball, ya f-cks off&#39;s
your house, your bitch I&#39;m getting sucked off
East, south, midwest, even up north
falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
all for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
catch me if you can, I&#39;m running past while y&#39;all walk

[Ca$hi$]
Shady made me for bringing it back
for the history of rap
it&#39;s gone with a snap, a sneer and a clap
what happened to just spittin about living in the muthaf-cking city you at
in the grimiest condition, I breath in drama
King Mathers and Cash me, thats freak karma
I&#39;m everything, anything, you could never be
its a hitting, rhyme in the month deep
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
no rest contest, contract to sign
by blood I&#39;m in this squad for life
hear out my wind pipes and I just chime
I&#39;m the reason you guys won&#39;t say that line
I&#39;m crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I&#39;m Rosemary&#39;s baby

[Eminem]
Shorty I love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be cause shorty
you love me
and I love you too
and I promise I&#39;ll be true to you

[Talking]
[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;]It is not about lyrics anymore,
It is not about lyrics anymore
its about a hot beat, a hot beat
its about a hot beat, a hot beat
a hot hot hot beat
and a catchy hook
a hot hot hot beat
and a catchy hook
nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
I don&#39;t care if you gotta rhyme smo, joe, toe and glow
now get out there and sell some God-damn records
[/QUOTE]
What do you think about these rap musics and on which way are they going through?
Do you agree with these rappers?

<p>this guy speaks the truth. it’s a huge pet peeve of mine when people say there’s no good music these days. i was just talking about this on facebook the other day when a friend of mine said this:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I think music now is BETTER by far than then, it’s just more spread out. In the 70’s and 60’s their was loads of instantly forgettable pop music and at most maybe a few dozen really great mainstream bands and then a few hundred or possibly a thousand good underground bands, now their are so many glorious underground rockers in a bazillion interesting genres and bad-ass huge bands that are hugely divergent and the underground hip hop movement and thousands of remixers and other electronic wizards, the scale of the music we have now available to us, freely more often than not, is staggering.</p>
<p>Anyone who says music is worse off now is profoundly lacking in the ability to find it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>and i think he’s completely right.</p>

            <p>People hating on modern music I really hope you aren’t that ignorant?  The only reason older music seems good is because all the meritocracy is forgotten.  No body remembers the averages just the highs and lows.  You remember the great stuff and have since learned to laugh at the bad stuff.  Give modern music time, look back and realize there are a lot more gems than you realize.</p>

            <p>I fucking hate it when someone takes one song and uses it as proof that today’s music is shit. JUST BECAUSE YOU DON’T KNOW ABOUT IT DOESN’T MEAN IT’S NOT THERE.</p>

<p>But then again, this goes for nearly all progressive rock. Yes doesn’t exactly have standard lyrics either.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Give it 30 years. The only reason it seems like all music from 30-40 years ago is good is because all the shit has been filtered off over the years. It was also a lot easier to filter off the shit then than now, on account of the lack of networking, digital music formats, and whatnot that facilitates even a middling song going viral overnight today.</p>
<p>There’s more music in more styles coming out more rapidly and passed around much more quickly on account of our connectivity than at any time before. Give it a couple decades. Whatever survives beyond simply being a flavor of the moment will be the music that defines the new millenium, and I bet when that time comes and the scum and the ear acid has been skimmed off the pond, will we fondly remember these decades for…whatever happens to survive, while simultaneously bemoaning the death of music on account of whatever’s hit-making at that time.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to harp and bitch and moan and complain and worry about the state of music these days while simultaneously torrenting the shit out of it all, and like most things, money talks. Whatever’s on the radio is on the radio because it apparently makes the big bucks. If you really are uncomfortable with that, well, toughnuggets. Take your dollars and spend them on the music you want to hear, and don’t pirate the shit out of the struggling artist whose pain and passion or whatever crafted his beautiful music.</p>
<p>Now, we can cherry-pick the greatest offenders today and put them up against the greatest legends from the past and then sit back and go “see, look at that! it’s a sign!” (Thinking of that ridiculous image posted a few posts above this one,)  All we want, but we’re lying to ourselves. Judging by the very “What are you listening to” thread that’s been a part of this community since I can remember, there’s clearly plenty of tunes out there that you all are partaking in and enjoying, and there’s an incredible growth in musical exploration and diversity than there has ever been.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve ranted for days about this now, so I’ll boil down the tl;dr points-- music has always had crappy artists. It takes time for the cream and the crap to separate, so judging music of today against the hits of the past is like comparing a bottle of grape juice to a 1920 vintage. There’s more diversity in sound and music than there has ever been before, and the internet allows anyone with a keyboard and even a hint of motivation to put his crap out there. So, yes, bad music is everywhere, it always has been, it just travels farther faster than it should ever have a right to these days.</p>
