    <description>so here is the thing: I played Crusader Kings and disliked it - I posted it on steam in CK II -section:

&quot;sometimes I am amazed how ♥♥♥♥ty can be history in games. I&#39;ll take my example. my country is Georgia. so I was extremely happy when I saw it in list of available Countries... BUT! here comes the ♥♥♥♥... what country is on the map? it is defiantly not Georgia. parts of country are horribly misplaced, and dynasty of Georgian kings was Bagrations not Bagratuni&#39;s. you know what I smell here? Armenian ♥♥♥♥.They do thinks like this very often and not only in games. after they placed Erevan as port city in Knigts of Honor (yes it was developed by Armenians as well, I won&#39;t even mention how crappy was mapping of georgia) I am not amazed of the same crap here. Lack of tutorial also is extremely Frustrating. you start playing and you think: WTF I have to do...
 I stopped playing after 10 mins.

 Conclusion: this game sucks, there are lot of other games that are not developed by Armenians and I&#39;ll stick to them.&quot;

don&#39;t get me wrong I am not racist. I have few armenian friends and they are good guys. but the thing what I was talking up, is casual thing to be done by armenians and not only in games(sadly).

so the thing is that thread got deleted in few hours. after that I posted in other thread about CK and after some discussion it got deleted. so I got the question: why I think that moderator is Armenian?</description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Zen609]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here’s how this breaks down:</p>
<p>Ethnic Georgians are an ethnoreligious group, meaning that the culture, history and religion are interdependent, as with Jews, the culture, history, and religion are the same thing. They have their own religion, their own National Church. They have a strong national, ethnic, religious and cultural identity which are all intertwined and all based on an historical myth.</p>
<p>The myth is basically that the Georgians are a biblical people, descended from King David.</p>
<p>This myth originated in the 11th century, and more details, including exact dates, were added in the 18th century, This myth was taken from a 1st millenium Armenian myth that the Armenians abandoned  in the middle ages, and the Georgians adopted during their nationalization. The Georgian Bagratids used the myth as organizational rhetoric to bring together groups of varying ethnicity into a national identity with a shared origin, and in doing so created Georgia as a singular people, nationality, religion, and culture.</p>
<p>And so what does this have to do with this discussion? The Georgian myth says that the ‘Bagrat’ in the word Bagrationi is derived from the name of a single person - Bagrat, the son of Guaram, one of seven brothers of the Royal line of King David who came to Georgia from Palestine. The Georgians are descended from King David, and as such, are the chosen-people.</p>
<p>The entire story is a myth. It’s not real history, and no one outside of Georgia views it as anything but myth. Inside Georgia, I suspect that there are a certain percentage of people who understand that it’s a myth, and a certain percentage that believe that it is real history. Assassin is one of the people who think that it’s real history.</p>
<p>The actual accepted view of modern historians is that the Bagrat were a feudal family who acquired land first in what is now Armenia and branched into what is now Georgia - and by virtue of land ownership, attained noble status.  As a house of nobility, they were referred to as the Bagratuni, or Bagrationi in Georgian, meaning  the House of Bagrat.  In English, we refer to them as the Bagratids, regardless of branch, i.e., Armenian Bagratids, Georgian Bagratids.</p>
<p>The Georgian view of history is well-known to be radically inaccurate. This may be the reason that the Swedish game makers used the word Bagratuni, instead of the Georgian spelling, because anyone interested in accurate history wouldn’t use a Georgian source.</p>
<p>Georgian Bagratids, Georgian Bagratuni, and Bagrationi are all the same thing.</p>
<p>From way earlier in the thread -</p>

<p>I don’t need your explanation. I wrote everything more exact up:</p>
<p>connected or associated<br>
similar or related in quality or character<br>
having close kinship and appropriateness</p>

<p>Oh, so <span class="bbcode-i">now</span> you know the meaning of ‘related’.</p>
<p>You’ve allowed yourself to be reduced to desperately arguing about the semantics of the word ‘related’. The use of ‘related’ here is clearly the usage meaning ‘kin’ or ‘the same family’.</p>
<p>You don’t understand your own copypasta, which contradicts your propositions regarding both the Bagratid and your semantic argument regarding ‘related’.</p>

<p>“The exact origin of the Bagratuni, as well as of the related Georgian branch (Bagrationi)” .</p>

</aside>
<p>‘Related’ as in ‘the same family’ - and ‘branch’ as in ‘branch of the family’</p>
<p>BTW - when the article says ‘the exact origin of the Bagratuni’, it means where they came from before they appeared in Armenia - and that is not even at issue here.</p>
<p>Your copypasta on the previous page - and I’m not posting this stuff as a point of argument, but only to show that you’re blindly and desperately posting copypasta that you haven’t read or don’t understand - the passages betray your propositions:</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t see any further argument here for you. The point has been clearly demonstrated in no uncertain terms. <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=473704&amp;postcount=107" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=473704&amp;postcount=107</a></p>
<p>Now, all you’re doing is arguing the semantics of a common word who’s meaning is clear in the context -  a total Aspie move - and posting copypasta that opposes your own proposition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bagratid Princes of Armenia are known as early as 1st century B.C. when they served under the Artaxiad Dynasty. Unlike most noble families on Armenia they held only strips of land, as opposed to the Mamikonians, who held a unified land territory. These are the earliest Bagratid princes in Armenia prior to the establishment of the kingdom, as mentioned by the Union of Armenian Noblemen. Ashot I was the first Bagratid King, the founder of the Royal dynasty. He was recognized as prince of princes by the court at Baghdad in 861, which provoked war with local Arab emirs. Ashot won the war, and was recognized as King of the Armenians by Baghdad in 885. Recognition from Constantinople followed in 886. In an effort to unify the Armenian nation under one flag, the Bagratids subjugated other Armenian noble families through conquests and fragile marriage alliances. Eventually, some noble families such as the Artsrunis and the Siunis broke off from the central Bagratid authority.[3] Ashot III the Merciful transferred their capital to the city of Ani, now famous for its ruins. They kept power by playing off the competition between the Byzantine Empire and the Arabs.</p>
