    <title>Vote for &quot;the&quot; female Commander Shepard</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vote-for-the-female-commander-shepard/7550</link>
    <description>If you are part of the apparent minority who cares about the female version of Mass Effect&#39;s protagonist (Bioware says only 18% of ME players have played as femshep), here&#39;s your chance to help decide what the official female Commander Shepard will look like on the box art for and, apparently, the default appearance for female Shepard in Mass Effect 3.

[url]https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150244340101645.322035.85811091644&amp;type=1[/url]

So are you interested or do you only roll male Shepard? If you like the lady hero, who&#39;s your favorite? I&#39;d be happy with any of these, they all look great, but if I had to choose I&#39;d pick 3 since she looks most like my female Shepard. But I can&#39;t choose, since I don&#39;t use Facebook and I don&#39;t intend to start now, so if anyone doesn&#39;t really care you can vote for her for me.  :wink:</description>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Word is those kinds of relationships can happen, and in a broader way than just going pseudo-lesbian for an asari. I’m hoping that they make it REALLY obvious what is going to lead you into a romance though, cause it’s gonna be pretty awkward to suddenly find my male Shepard kissing Garrus or something. In the first 2 games some romances really surprised me, because I thought I was just being nice to them but evidently I had triggered a secret love flag. I think it happened more in 1 though, as I recall 2 had the characters ask you more directly what you wanted to make of your relationship.</p>
<p>I also hope they don’t make the romance options even more artificial with this. To me the romances were already somewhat forced, and it seemed like you could pretty much pick up anyone. I wouldn’t like to see that every character could now be romanced by any Shepard. It just seems like fantasy fulfilling and less like living in a real world, where people will shoot you down or want to stay friends or have a sexual orientation that they won’t change. I like being able to make choices and determine how I’m going to play, and I like my teammates to react like real people with set personalities.</p>

<p>All I hope is that they’ll keep all appearances available in the face generator.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah I’m hoping these faces are the preset faces for ME3’s face creator, cause they look great. ME1 and 2’s presets weren’t very good, and despite my best efforts working the sliders, my female Shepard never seemed to come out quite right.</p>
<p>I also play male Shepard but I just go with default for him. I don’t know why but I can’t picture anyone as Shepard but the default appearance. Maybe I was too influenced by the official artwork, or maybe the first time I played I got fed up with the character creator and just went with the preset. In any case I think he looks fine.</p>
<p>How do you guys feel about Shepard’s voice actors? Did they influence you at all to who you played? I know some people hate Hale’s performance but like Mark Meer’s, and vice versa, which meant they could only play as one or the other. I like them both, honestly, so I guess I feel a little lucky since I feel like I can get more out the games.</p>

<p>Honestly I don’t like any of 'em.  And I usually play femshep.  Back to the drawing board IMO Bioware.</p>
<p>Why do they need to add femshep to the boxart anyway, when the canon shep is male?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is no canon actually, aside from the main storyline. (Sovereign invades Citadel, Saren dies, Shepard invades Collector base, etc.) As for the appearance though, there is no canon Shepard. The one on the cover is the only face they actually had to PAY for, as it’s from a Dutch model named Mark Vanderloo, so of course they’re gonna use his face on everything.</p>
<p>But as for the FemShep crowd, I’ve played as a lot of different FemSheps but I still like playing as maleShep better and honestly don’t care if they give FemSheps some attention as well, as long as MaleShep gets equal attention.</p>
