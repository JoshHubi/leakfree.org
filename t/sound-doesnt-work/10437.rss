    <title>Sound doesn&#39;t work?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sound-doesnt-work/10437</link>
    <description>I do not know what&#39;s going on.

I finally got Black Mesa to start working on my Mac using Parallels, and everything loads fine: all the graphics and all the revamped maps look awesome, except for one thing.  My sound for some reason does not work. No sound comes through the headphones or the speakers, even setting all the sound options on and the quality set on all levels. I tried the usual -dxlevel 9 (from Garry&#39;s Mod) and -dxlevel 10 (Half-Life 2) which both fixed graphical errors and sound errors, but the game still does not work. Any help would be great!

SPECS:
2012 Macbook Pro
2.3Ghz Intel Core i7
using Windows XP Service Pack 3, Parallels 8</description>

</aside>
<p>On my Mac Mini 2011 2.7 Intel Core i7, ATI Radeon 6xxx chip, 8Gb memory it works flawlessly. I have it at 2540xsomething (native for Mac 27" Cinema Display)and it goes fairly smooth. I was using Win8 in the VM. I like how the game runs in it’s own Space and can swipe to and from it. I may have to drop the resolution a little if things get busier and get framerate hits but no complaints so far.</p>
<p>If I run at that resolution on PlayOnMac using Wine 1.5.19, it runs like a dog (have to turn of GLSL for Radeon graphics also, else is unusable with Wine, but Wine plays good at about 2140x something with GLSL off). Fonts in Wine look a bit off and best to run X-Widows full screen, and after exiting hit Opt-Alt-A to see the desktop (else get Black screen)</p>
<p>I think Wine doesn’t have as efficient DirectX emulation as Parallels.</p>
<p>Hopefully you will be able to get the sound going - is something else using the sound in XP and locking you out ? Do you get Sound in your XP VM outside of the game ?</p>
