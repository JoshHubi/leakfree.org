    <title>Evolve... it&#39;s a game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/evolve-its-a-game/13394</link>
    <description>For those of you who don&#39;t know what it is: It&#39;s a game similar to Left 4 Dead (actually from the makers of said game) you can take the role of one of 4 hunters or 1 of several &quot;monsters&quot; that have different abilities.

The hunter&#39;s objective is to hunt down the monster and kill it, the monster&#39;s objective is to survive until they evolve to level 3 and either do objectives around the maps or attempt to eliminate the hunters.

The more of this game I see, the more I want to play it.

            <p>I really want it TBH. Apparently they’re putting in singleplayer but we all know it’s just gonna be MP with customisable bots like in CSS and L4D2. I don’t mind, bots are fine with me</p>
<p>tldr turtle rock is rad imo</p>
