    <title>A fun game WIP</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-fun-game-wip/7461</link>
    <description>Hello, again.

I&#39;m making (another) video game. It&#39;s game-play will be focused around moving at fast, uncapped speeds, along with basic platforming tactics such as wall-jumping and whatnot. This is still a rough idea, though.

The thing I wanted to try out though is the Image-Based level system, where one layer would be the actual level, and another Foreground layer would be artsy details and whatnot. Right now I have just the basic level and some even simpler properties for them. For now, you can overwrite the current level with your own (as long as the play space is transparent!) image, and change the spawn positions and information, such as the level title and author, or the dimensions of the image. (If it isn&#39;t equal to the actual image dimensions, it will be stretched out to fit the ones you gave it.)

The SpikeX and SpikeY thing under obj doesn&#39;t really do anything ATM, but I plan to have an object editor so you can place objects easier in the level.

Oh, and you open the level properties with notepad, and the image should be PNG.  :slight_smile: 

Heres is a screenshot:

And here is the download:

[b][u]UPDATED VERSION: [url]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21499454/Games/New%20folder/speedemontigsrc.rar[/url][/u][/b]

If you have any ideas about the editor, or what I should do to make it less crap (If it is.), let me know.  :wink: 

EDIT: Thanks for the move and title change! :3

EDIT2: 

Here are all the controls I forgot to post:

Left + Right Arrow keys - movement

Shift - Jump/Walljump

Down Arrow - Slow down/Stop

Ctrl [Toggle] - Focus Mode (Used to make complex movement at high-speeds easier.)</description>

            <p>[quote=“sersoft”]<br>
I made a custom map and found out that you can’t walk on slanted surfaces, and you can jump from walls<br>
[/QUOTES]<br>
Slanted surfaces eh? That’s gonna be a bitch to fix. :\</p>
<p>If the pixels are small enough you should be able to go up the slope. I will try this now.</p>
<p>EDIT: I was right. You gotta have the image equal to the canvas size of the game for it to function properly, or artifacts can mess up the game. :\</p>
<p>Just add more PIXIELZ</p>
