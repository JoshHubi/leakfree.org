    <title>Interlaced/Simple screen effects</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/interlaced-simple-screen-effects/13268</link>
    <description>Ok I know this sounds a bit dumb but I have a crappy pc at the moment and I am dying to play black mesa again. It runs ok in low resolutions like 800x600 , 640x480.

I would like to play it in 16:9 and was wondering if anyone knows how, or has made an interlaced screen mod? so I could bump up the res to 1366x768 which is my laptops native resolution. I got the idea from this websites home page where the screenshots are interlaced. 

Also it would be fun to fiddle with screen effects for example (film grain). If anyone knows if this is possible in source engine let me know please.

Thanks</description>

            <p>While that <span class="bbcode-i">may or may not</span> be possible in Source, I’m pretty sure it’s impossible with Black Mesa, at least right now when we have no Source code.</p>
<p>Either way, if the mod runs “ok” at the lowest resolutions available, I doubt any screen effects are gonna let it run well at 720p. You’re just gonna have to shove the settings down and hope for the best. There’s also tinkering with the -dxlevel parameter, but I hear lower ones create huge graphical errors in Black Mesa.</p>
