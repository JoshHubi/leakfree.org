    <title>Including BMS on a Valve Game Package</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/including-bms-on-a-valve-game-package/8507</link>
    <description>A while ago I suggested that the BMS team try to get Valve to include Black Mesa in one of their game packs. I thought it would be a nifty way to distribute it to a lot of people easily, and maybe even have it ported to consoles.

I just wanted to refresh this idea, given that it&#39;s been a while since it&#39;s been talked about and BMS is closer to completion.</description>

            <p>If BMS was included in a valve game then said game would never be released until about 10 years after the game was finished and without the mod due to the devs of the mod aiming for the impossible goal of 100% perfection and generally faffing about</p>

            <p>It would only happen if enough people at Valve think it’s a cool thing to spend their time on and if they think it would be valuable to the customers. As it is, Black Mesa is supposed to be released as a free mod and it’ll be easily available through the usual means so there’s no reason for Valve to get involved, really.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it would be super cool if Valve were working on a new engine with super cool new features and had roped in the BM devs to do the Half Life section of a total remake of the series. However, that is very unlikely and just wishful thinking on my part.</p>

<p>On a more serious note, no this probably won’t happen. VALVe is being very friendly with BM (protip VALVe told them to take away the S) but that doesn’t mean they’ll release it officially. It’s a nice pipe dream, but no.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, Valve does have links for mods like Synergy, Zombie Panic and a few others on Steam, but then again, those probably need to be really popular and, while Black Mesa is popular, I doubt it would be easy.</p>
