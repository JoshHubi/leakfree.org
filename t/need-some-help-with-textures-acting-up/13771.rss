    <title>Need some help with textures acting up</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-some-help-with-textures-acting-up/13771</link>
    <description>Think this is the right board for this, lemme know if I&#39;m wrong though.
Started up Black Mesa for the first time today, (been trying to since it came out in 2012 but my computer&#39;s been too shitty for it to run more than 5 minutes before it&#39;d overheat and shut down) and I&#39;m having a few issues with textures. First off, my hand is too shiny look at this:

I made an attempt to mess with the .vmts for v_hand but I&#39;ve replaced every vmt with the originals but its still doing this.
Second of all:

I don&#39;t even know what the issue here is or what I did beyond installing the Beta Bullsquid Eye mod
And another thing, though I can probably figure this out on my own eventually, is how to get IIopn&#39;s M9 to show the default v_hands over Thanez&#39; that&#39;d be nice too but my main concern is with the pepsiman hands please help me</description>

            <p>I’d make sure your dxlevel is set properly to fix the first issue.<br>
The second one, you probably just described exactly what You did wrong (installing a mod and it broke something).<br>
Lastly, as far as I know, you can’t use the default Hands with that mod because they have a custom rig and animation set. You’d need to manually rerig and animate them yourself.</p>
