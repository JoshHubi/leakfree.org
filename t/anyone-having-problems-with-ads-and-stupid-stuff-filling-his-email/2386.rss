<p>Web spiders are much more common-place and a more reliable system for spammers from my understanding. Even if they do dictionary attacks, they will be sending a huge amount of emails to bad addresses, which is a huge waste of resources.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The thing is, spammers don’t even have to pay for any kind of resources… they feed off all the spyware and viruses that infect … probably the majority of computers?</p>
<p>It’s clear that posting your email somewhere, or registering to suspicious sites using your email WILL bring you spam, but if your email is like <a href="mailto:johnsmith@whatever.com" data-bbcode="true">johnsmith@whatever.com</a>, you will get spammed either way.</p>
<p>Also, hotmail’s filter sucks BADLY… the only way to filter all the crap is to use the ‘exclusive’ filter, which filters out EVERYTHING that doesn’t come from your contacts and green list. It sucks. I switched from my hotmail to a gmail because of this, actually. Well, this and that something managed to spam all my contacts from some IP in China… some kind of account hijacking. So I had serious doubts on the security of hotmail.</p>

            <p>I just had a long informational post written, then the “Back” button on my mouse got pushed against my biopod, and I lost it.  Yay.</p>
<p>Here’s the gist:  You don’t always have to give it.  Sometimes it’s not required.  For some things, yeah, it’s a good idea, but don’t put it on some sketchy site.  Uncheck boxes while signing up for perfectly legitimate accounts such as “Yes, share my information with business-associates/partners/advertisement-firms/spam-mail-companies/etc.”  Also, avoid putting your e-mail where such terms are listed in the fine print, and are not uncheckable.</p>
<p>Finally, the obvious help:  Free ringtone sites, iq quizzes, meet-hot-single-now sites…  probably bad places.  I mean, set up a spam account if you’re really into that.  You’re e-mail is probably safer with most porn sites than you’d think.  But it’s not a bad idea to have a spam account for that, too, heh…</p>

            <p>For spammers, they usually have a ‘product’ they want to sell and don’t see ‘traditional’ methods as being cost-effective.  So they go to more unorthodox routes.  There are places that claim to have many thousands of e-mail addresses.  You buy the list and then send your ad to every one of those addresses.  If you get 100,000 e-mail addresses for $10, and you get 0.1% response, that’s a hundred new customers for your $10.  Good deal, right?</p>
<p>Also.  Do NOT click the unsubscribe links in spams.  This confirms that your e-mail address is legit and will place you on more lists.  Sure you might not get any spam from that one company, but…</p>
<p>Do what I do:  I have an e-mail address that I use for almost everything and have received almost zero spam.   Set up a good spam filter and spend some quality time to train it.  Do not open spam if it gets by your filter; delete it quickly.  If you’re paranoid about spam, set up a spam address and a private address.  When you sign up for things, use the spam address.  Only give out your private address to people you trust in non-Internet media such as in person or on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>I also do not use webmail based clients.</p>

            <p>I dunno what the laws are like in Jordan, but you might be able to get away with sending them an offical warning to cease and desist, or legal action will be taken. Certainly in the UK spamming is illegal and any company partaking in said, and is taken to court will be fined. But I dunno if that’s an international law or not…</p>
<p>EDIT: I’ve had my yahoo account for around 5 years now and the only mails I get are forum auto notifications, and mail from people I know. Hiding your address/not putting it anywhere works wonders. Another thing to consider: if you need an email address to do something, but are concerned about spam, try <a href="https://www.mailinator.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this.</a></p>
