    <title>Song Scavenger Hunt</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/song-scavenger-hunt/14668</link>
    <description>Okay, so there is this song playing in my head, which I KNOW I have heard before, but I cannot for the life of me find it anywhere, so I am turning to you guys for help (and also a hand if you guys have any music in your head you can&#39;t identify)

The lyrics that I remember(whether correctly or incorrectly) are something like this:

[b]&quot;It&#39;s an illusion, whoa an illusion, like the sta(aaaaaaaa)rs in the sky tonight&quot;[/b]


It sounds vaguely country iirc, but I cannot find anything even remotely like it on google, which leads me to believe I&#39;m remembering some part of it wrong.

Anyone here know what song this might be? Anyone else have a song they can&#39;t find but know exists somewhere?</description>

            <p>Oh hey that would be good to add, I’m remembering it as a man, the best way to describe is a generic, middle aged country type voice but it was a long time ago when I heard it, so I could have most of that wrong</p>

            <p>That’s pretty catchy, I’m afraid the only way I’m gonna find my song is if I write it and wait for someone to call copyright infringement. It’s been in my head for years and I’ve never been able to find it</p>

            <p>Oh god I’ve had one of these recurring for over a year. I found it entirely by accident, through Wikipedia of all places, listened to it, enjoyed it, and then thoroughly forgot what it was called.<br>
It doesn’t help that it’s a Japanese song from, like, the 50s or 60s, making the lyrics impossible for me to remember as well, since I only speak English with any degree of fluency.<br>
I do recall that it was localized to the US with a different name and set of lyrics. The original lyrics had something to do with rain.<br>
I can remember the melody fairly clearly, though. Which makes it all the more infuriating that I can’t recall anything else about it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Less than a minute after posting it I did another search and I found it almost instantly.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiyaki_(song)" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sukiyaki</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck finding your song, (rot), and everyone else who posts in the future.</p>
