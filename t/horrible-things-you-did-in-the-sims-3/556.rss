<p>Well, that’s mostly to compensate for being able to go through the whole neighbourhood without loading screens. It’s designed to run well on slower systems, so they didn’t put as much effort making it super high res textures and such.</p>

<p>Not really my fault, but my male sim slept with his male neighbor, even though both were married and with children. That was a LONG time ago in sims 2 and I got traumatized forever.</p>

            <p>[Sims 2] I made a house with about 8 people in it with no way out and no bathrooms. Someone died pretty soon after (kitchen fire or something) I removed the doors and turned into a ghost. So it’s been a couple nights and (by this time of course everyone is pissing on the floor and crying) the ghost comes back and makes one of the sims shit themselves and die. That same thing keeps happening until there’s only one sim left in a house full of piss and one expensive TV so I just decide to drop a satellite on her with a mod i had.</p>

            <p>I made a single mother with 5 beautiful young children, then filled their house with wooden furniture and fire places and set it all ablaze.<br>
And just when they thought they could escape, I removed all the doors and all but one window and let them suffocate and burn to death.<br>
I made one child watch through the single window as his entire family perished in the inferno.<br>
Good <span class="bbcode-b">god</span> I’m twisted.</p>

            <p>Well, I made really maze-ish house, which had rags on the floor next to each other. I set the fire up with fireworks. The rags worked as an “burning rope”, where the fire closely got closer to the inner room, where I forced my sims to play arcade games non-stop just to avoid the “omg my house is on fire” panic. Eventually they all burned in hot, sexy fire, doing what they loved most; playing arcade games.</p>

            <p>i made a 6-story building designed to entrap and kill Pizza delivery guys and firemen.</p>
<p>EDIT: I also made a guy with no jaw live at the top of the house to seduce visiting neighbors, and then I’d have the neighbor killed. Then the jawless man went bananas and died in a puddle of his own piss from being deprived of social interaction.</p>
<p>Sims 2 was the first game I ever skinned for! Got Sims 3 yesterday and I’ll be fudging around with it later.</p>

            <p>I once tried to kill almost everyone in the game of Morrowind.  It was fun killing the Demi-god Vivec.  Never played Sims.</p>
