    <title>Stuck pixel on new monitor is driving me nuts</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stuck-pixel-on-new-monitor-is-driving-me-nuts/6409</link>
    <description>It&#39;s one pixel out of a couple million, and it&#39;s a fine monitor otherwise, but this is driving me nuts by its manner.

It&#39;s a light green pixel and it seems to only go away after the monitor shuts down and cools off.  It reappears after the monitor warms up, after about 10 minutes.

It also seems to darken if I put a window under it.  Not close to it, just under it.  Strange.

What can I do to get rid of it and put my mind at ease?</description>

            <p>It was a news item a few months ago, a bloke got a refund for a broken telly he bought from Tesco years ago. I did try and find it on the BBC news website, but gave up</p>
<p>Essentially it’s a fairly obscure law, and he made such a pain of himself they eventually honoured it</p>
<p>Either way it’s fairly likely I’ve got some of the details wrong</p>

            <p>What you say is half correct Jim, but you do have 6 years in which to claim. According to the sale of goods act 79, for 6 months after the sale it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to prove it was not faulty at manufacture.</p>
<p>If however the item is deemed to be faulty within the claim time, it has not been subjected to anything but normal wear and tear, and this is an unreasonably short amount of time for such a product to last, then this is deemed as a fault at manufacture, and is therefore covered under the original warranty.</p>
<p>Under UK law anyway.</p>

            <p>It’s not anything like 7 years for either the EU or UK (they differ sometimes). It’s two years for a <span class="bbcode-b">fault which was present at first delivery</span>, i.e. does not cover a product which develops a fault, it is up to the manufacturer how long they cover these faults.</p>
<p>Proving it is another matter. For the first 6months it’s up to the manufacturer to prove it wasn’t originally faulty. After that the customer has to prove that the fault has been present since original purchase.</p>
<p>Sorry to burst that bubble.</p>
<p>Regardless in my opinion if you have just one faulty pixel it shows the product is faulty so you should get a replacement.</p>

</aside>
<p>??</p>
<p>How does this even work? Say you buy a new hard drive… the manufacturer usually gives like 3 years warranty. After that, if you ask them for a replacement, they’ll probably just tell you to deal with it. Or do all manufacturers give a 7 year warranty in Europe?</p>
<p>I’m confused.<br>
And skeptical, but too lazy to google  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
It’s the “<span class="bbcode-b">any</span> electrical product” part that I doubt… surely it can’t cover anything that has a wire or a battery in it…</p>

I had a point on the screen which was brighter than the rest and it wasn’t just one pixel, multiple pixels were affected.<br>
It looked more like a LED would shine through.(it wasn’t a LED monitor)</p>

<p>You buy it for $20, and you get 30 days pixel protection. You can RMA the product regardless of whether a pixel is dead, but this gets you your money back instead of a replacement product.</p>

            <p>I used to have a faulty pixel but it fixed itself after a while. They are only really noticable on a black background usually anyway in my experience. I don’t really see the logic of <span class="bbcode-i">how</span> it fixed itself, but oh well.</p>
<p>If they are being resistant about exchanging it, try just being a tough customer. Just make a bit of a racket about it being “broken”, when others are around, but not enough for them to be able to call security about them. Just annoy them lots.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Just be sure to apologise and be polite afterwards. Annoying them is all very well, but leaving them like that is a bit cruel.</p>

<p>Out of curiousity, do you know if jailbreaking voids this warranty? Or are Apple’s claims only prevelant in the US.</p>

            <p>If you’ve paid money for a monitor that’s faulty, under European law they have to change it. It doesn’t matter how many pixels there are, by paying for goods you’re entering a contract with the retailer that they’ve broken by supplying faulty goods. Also under EU law you’re entitled to a 7-year warranty on any new electrical product, regardless of what warranties you buy or what the shop says they offer.</p>
<p>I say EU law because I don’t pretend to have the first clue about US law. However over here the Office of Fair Trading gives consumer advice on their website, maybe you have something similar?</p>
<p>(Interesting side note: the office of fair trading has said that anyone in the UK who’s bought Black Ops for PS3 is entitled to a refund, as the bugs in the game mean it violates the trade descriptions act. Only slightly relevant, but food for thought  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>

            <p>Most manufacturer warranties only replace stuck or dead pixels if there are more than 3 to 5, depending on the manufacturer. Most retail outlets will do an exchange if you have a receipt within 14 days of purchase. For online purchases, it depends on the site. Some of them will tell you to talk to the manufacturer, and some will send out a replacement (Newegg is pretty good for that).</p>
<p>Placement also makes a difference. If it’s somewhaere in the middle 2/3 of the screen, most reasonable places will exchange it. If it’s on the outer edge, they may just tell you to deal with it.</p>

            <p>Definitly return it. What can they say to you, " deal with it? ". You, by law, have the right to get it replaced. Make sure you have your receit and tell them that there is a bright pixel that shines. I don’t see any practical reason why they would’nt replace it.</p>

<p>They don’t do returns with a single faulty pixel.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why not? How many does it takes?</p>
<p>Unless there’s a specified minimum number of pixels stated in the warranty terms, it’s still a faulty monitor and it should be covered. If they tell you it’s not, IMO it’s bullshit.</p>
<p>Returning items is always a huge hassle though… especially large items like monitors.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’ve tried two of the pixel flashers for hours and hours with no such luck.</p>

            <p>Have you tried some of the easier solutions like those videos of flashing colors, or displaying one color for a couple of days?</p>

            <p>It’s one pixel out of a couple million, and it’s a fine monitor otherwise, but this is driving me nuts by its manner.</p>
<p>It’s a light green pixel and it seems to only go away after the monitor shuts down and cools off.  It reappears after the monitor warms up, after about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>It also seems to darken if I put a window under it.  Not close to it, just under it.  Strange.</p>
<p>What can I do to get rid of it and put my mind at ease?</p>
