[b]Overview:[/b][/size]
Developed by PSR Digital, [i]Black Mesa: Hazard Course[/i] is an addon for Black Mesa centered around a completely new take on Half-Life&#39;s training level, [i]Hazard Course[/i], featuring 6 maps, a wealth of new models and textures, an expanded introduction and outro sequence (based on the sequence exclusive to the PS2 version of Half-Life), and tons of new dialogue from the entire [i]Black Mesa[/i] voice cast.

[i]Black Mesa: Hazard Course[/i] is currently only supported on the Free/Mod version of [i]Black Mesa[/i]. You can download it from ModDB via the button below.

[url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-hazard-course&#39;]![](upload://u1s59NfUxQ3X2Q2eymwX9TyVpNC.png)[/url]

A Steam version is in the works and will uploaded to the Workshop at some time in the future. There is currently no ETA for that version.

For updates and miscellaneous behind-the-scenes goodies, check out [i]Hazard Course[/i] on Facebook!

            <p>We’ve no reason to believe that. The way Black Mesa reads/mounts custom content and the Workshop weirdness isn’t related to Xen and probably won’t be fixed until post-Xen.</p>

            <p>Just in case you’re not aware of this, I’ve discovered a little change during the translation of the new bms.txt file of Black Mesa:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“BMS_Hint_LongJump”"%+jump%         Activate Long Jump\n[Double-Tap Space while moving]"</span><br>

<p>I posted a few in-game scripted sequence ideas in the Hazard Course thread that could take place in a cafeteria in between level segments in the Hazard Course (should they choose to include one) I’m making this thread to try and keep their thread clear of clutter while they do important stuff.</p>
<p>Feel free to post your own in-game BM conversations/sequences, they can be anywhere in the game, as long as they fit with the BM universe, I guess they could count as fan fics, oh well.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">SCENARIO: After taking damage from something in the Hazard Course, Gordon walks into a cafeteria lounge, and sees Barney sitting at a table or leaning on a wall watching tv</span><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Woah, man-let me guess… get into an argument with one of the female scientists again? here, it’s on the house <em>holds out drink for player</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Havin’ a bad day champ? nothin’ a cold frosty Poke can’t fix <em>holds out drink for player</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Now, just to be clear, this counts as the drink, okay? <em>holds out drink for player</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Freeman, catch! <em>lobs the can to the player, will automatically be consumed on contact</em></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">SCENARIO: A group of scientists (2 or 3) and security guards (1 or 2) sitting at a table playing a game of poker</span><br>
<em>One of the scientists grabs a card</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Well?<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Well what?<br>
[COLOR=‘Magenta’]It’s your move, Richard.<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]I know, I know… [Under Breath] Ah crap…<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Uh, hey, didn’t they just call your name over the PA?<br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Quit stalling, you’re simply delaying the inevitable.<br>
<em>The player can walk around the table and see each player’s cards</em><br>
<em>When the player stands behind Guard 1 and looks at his cards, he sees that he has the losing hand, this initiates the next script</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]ah, AH, AAAAAHHH CHOO!<br>
<em>everyone drops their cards, they fly all around the table</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]My… god!<br>
[COLOR=‘Magenta’]Cover your mouth, you’re spreading germs everywhere!<br>
[COLOR=‘Cyan’]Hoooly hell!<br>
<em>The cards fall to the table and finally stop moving</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]…Heh, sorry about that fellas, I guess we’re gonna have to start over.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">SCENARIO: Same poker scene, this time no scripted animation, if the player presses E on one of the scientists:</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Stay back Freeman, who knows what biohazards you could’ve picked up in the Hazard Course with that suit of yours…<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]The only biohazard here is your fasion sense<br>
<em>laughter</em><br>
<em>laughter</em><br>
<em>Scientist looks at the other players with a puzzled face</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]What’s wrong with my polkadot tie?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">SCENARIO: A scientist is standing next to a security guard while he plays a Missile Command arcade machine</span><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]C’mon ya alien bastards!<br>
<em>The machine yells out</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleGreen’]GAME OVER<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Damn it!<br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Mind if I have a turn?<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Huh, knock yourself out<br>
<em>The scientist excels at the game, in less than 5 seconds he completes the first level</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleGreen’]LEVEL ONE COMPLETE<br>
<em>The Security guard lets out a sarcastic exhale and crosses his arms as he continues to watch the scientist advance to level 2</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]You see my friend, the key to victory is strategy<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Oh yeah?<br>
<em>The security guard walks over to the side of the machine while the scientist is still playing</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Well here’s my strategy<br>
<em>The Security Guard drop kicks the side of the arcade machine</em><br>
<em>The scientist jumps back surprised</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Oh dear!<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleGreen’]WARNING! WARNING! WArNRSHD- WAHRLH-WREEhjhablurrrrr…<br>
<em>Coins begin to pour out of the machine like water</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Hohoo yeah, come to papa!<br>
<em>The security guard scoops up a bunch of coins into his arms</em><br>
<em>The scientist looks around to see if anyone’s noticed</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]I do believe some pepperoni pizza is in order, come on buddy, my treat<br>
<em>The security guard begins to walk over to the canteen with his heap of stolen coins</em><br>
<em>The scientist puts his hand on his forehead, sighs, and shakes his head in disapproval</em><br>
<em>the scientist then proceeds to follow the security guard</em></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">SCENARIO: Gordon walks up to a scientist and guard having a discreet conversation</span><br>
<em>They’re talking about a female scientist, who is a few metres away at the canteen with her back turned to them, gathering various food onto her tray</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]But I don’t know what to say to her<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Ah come on, just say the first thing that comes to your mind<br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]…Nothing’s coming to my mind!<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Alright alright, fine, I’ll tell you what to say<br>
<em>the security guard whispers something into his ear</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]Now go over there and hit a home run<br>
<em>The scientist stands up, straightens his tie and takes in a deep breath, he then nervously walks over to the woman</em><br>
<em>the scientist stands next to her, she doesn’t seem to notice him, she continues to study the food</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Um, hello Annette<br>
[COLOR=‘Magenta’]Ah, Walter, what is it?<br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]There’s something I need to to tell you, my density, has popped me to you<br>
[COLOR=‘Magenta’]Um, excuse me doctor?<br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Oh, I’m terribly sorry, what I meant to say is, my destiny, has brought me to you<br>
[COLOR=‘Magenta’]Wait a minute, isn’t that a line from Back to The Future?<br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Uh, well-<br>
[COLOR=‘Magenta’]That’s one of my most favourite science fiction films of all time!<br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Really?<br>
<em>The scientist plays it cool</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]M-Mine too!<br>
[COLOR=‘Magenta’]Come, you must meet my colleagues<br>
<em>The female scientist wraps her arm around his, leading him off to her group of friends</em><br>
<em>The scientist looks at the security guard and gives him a cheesy thumbs up</em><br>
<em>The security guard sarcastically gives a thumbs up back</em><br>
<em>The Security Guard says to himself</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleTurquoise’]I don’t know how these kids ever survived without me</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">SCENARIO: Gordon walks into an office and sees a scientist under his desk looking for something</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Now where did I put my glasses?<br>
<em>The player can see that his glasses are on top of his desk, when he places them on the floor in front of the scientist, the next script is activated</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]There they are!<br>
(Achievement completed)<br>
<em>The scientist puts on his glasses, and then realises Gordon is standing there</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Pink’]Oh hello Gordon Freeman, it’s good to see you</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">SCENARIO: Gordon sneaks up on two soldiers</span><br>
[COLOR=‘Lime’]Arrhh, where the hell are those guys? I’m starving!<br>
[COLOR=‘PaleGreen’]Relax man, our shift’s over in 10 minutes<br>
[COLOR=‘Lime’]aaaah I can’t take it anymore!<br>
<em>The soldier uses his weapon to smash open a candy machine</em><br>
[COLOR=‘PaleGreen’]Haha, now that’s using your noodle!<br>
[COLOR=‘Lime’]Just shut up and help me<br>

<p>No, the issue is that the game crashes due to a buffer overflow because for some strange reason it attempts to load our changelog (which in and of itself is useless to the engine, so I don’t know why it’s even attempting to read it) into a buffer that’s way too small. I think I reported this bug a while ago. Multi-part VPKs in and of themselves work fine.</p>
<p>Thanks for reminding me about that, though. I forgot that we can still get the Hazard Course to not crash the game by just removing the changelogs from the VPK. However, that doesn’t solve the problem where none of the custom scripts, configuration files, localized strings, choreography, response rules, credits, etc. etc. get loaded (not to mention the eternal problems with logic_playerproxy), so the Course is still ridiculously broken.</p>

            <p>Our suit model is super low-detail compared to Black Mesa’s and lacks shader masks (both reason because it’s a hologram), so it would actually look not so great. Plus it’s not really our job, I don’t think any of us care to do that. Can’t stop anyone else from trying though.</p>

            <p>If your issue is the game crashing while loading the VPKs, there is a workaround for that. It’s not ideal and we can repair the intended functionality in the future, but it’s how I got OaRU working to get around the issue.</p>
<p>Make sure you’re not using the vpk.exe’s -M functionality (to create multipart VPKs). You need to create multiple VPKs just by dragging and dropping individual directories onto VPK.exe. The idea being, for your mod: one VPK for materials, one for models, one for maps, etc. Then bung all these VPKs into a folder, and point the workshop publishing tool at that folder. The VPK cannot get too big (roughly more than 200mb), or the tool runs out of memory and dies because of reasons we do not understand. If this happens, split the subfolder into multiple parts (materials-1, materials-2, etc). For OaRU, I made a VPK for each subfolder (models, materials, sound, etc), and then a VPK for each individual map.</p>
<p>This works fine, even though it’s a bit of a pain to muck around with. But it will at the very least allow you to load up the maps in the retail version without crashing.</p>

            <p>As a rule of thumb, pretty much anything we do on the Hazard Course isn’t going to be a secret from anyone curious enough to ask. The project started as a community project, after all. But if we don’t release some kind of media statement, it’s because we don’t exactly have anything significant to announce at the moment (or we just haven’t had time to make any kind of announcement). So feel free to ask what you want about the Hazard Course. It’s not like it’s Xen or something.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>As for your question about the menu, I honestly have no idea. None of us have any idea how the Steam version is going to work at the moment, since it’s still thoroughly broken. We’re pretty much almost completely unable to actually work on it at the moment, let alone think about how you guys will eventually experience it. Heck, workshop currently refuses to even load the Hazard Course when you subscribe to it (the game crashes before the main menu even shows up), so essentially even WE don’t know what the Hazard Course will look like when it finally gets to Steam. I promise we’ll let you know more when we know more.</p>
<p>So for now, we’re pretty much strictly focusing on enhancements that can be backported to a future update for the mod version, just to keep the team busy while the Crowbar Collective figures out how to deal with the smoldering pile of trainwreck that the Hazard Course workshop edition currently is.</p>

            <p>It´s actually the picture of a coldroom that made me wonder about this. To my eye, that is actually a big diffence in comparison and is the reason to my curiosity  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Also, will you be able to implment Steam- HC in BM´s main menu like it was in the mod version?

            <p>Depends on whether you’re curious about the Steam version specifically, or just the next update in general. An important thing that Jif didn’t mention there is that we’re not specifically working on the Steam version at this point. So while we’re making improvements of varying significance, they’re not necessarily for the Steam version exclusively. There probably isn’t going to be much major difference between the Steam version and free version, but there will be some bigger (and smaller) improvements over the first release in our next update, whether it’s Steam or free.</p>
<p>But that in mind, yeah, we’re not trying to be secretive, we just don’t want anyone expecting a major overhaul or anything. We’ve touched up/remade some textures and models, added brand new models here and there and made environmental improvements of varying significance. While actually not <span class="bbcode-i">the</span> most extreme example, the coldroom I posted a couple pages ago is one of the more noticeable improvements because it’s major, but a lot of what’s been done is improved but a lot probably wouldn’t be able to pick it out unless they were super familiar with the mod. I made a cool new door that’s used as a major prop in the simulated disaster segmetn, and while our testers liked the improvement, someone who’s only played once or twice probably wouldn’t even notice it was new.</p>
<p>Did anyone notice the doors in Office Complex got an upgrade? Probably not. Is anyone gonna notice we made these ibeams 3D, or this and that catwalk fancier? Also probably not. But that sorta stuff is a lot of what we’re doing because we were mostly (<span class="bbcode-i">mostly</span>) happy with things in the first release, so there’s primarily just small polish stuff to do. That said, there will definitely be a few things that’ll immediately jump out at you, but it’s mostly small stuff that we think is cool.</p>
