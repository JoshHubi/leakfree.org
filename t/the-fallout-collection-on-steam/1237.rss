So yeah as you all know my bank is a bitch and it takes me 6 to 8 business days to get money on my Paypal Account. So could anyone gift it to me and I would repay them as soon as the money is on my Paypal Account? Trust me I will repay you, just ask Level or Jambo.</description>

            <p>I think it will be completely diffrent to fallout 3 in many respects I wouldnt be suprised if you never saw a behemoth.  I dought they will ignore the f3 story but I’d bet its gonna be closer to Van Buran then anything else. Hell its the untold story of the fallout universe.</p>
<p>And for the original Fallout’s you need to give it another go, its worth the effort as theres some amazing work there. Its just were not used to the difficulty curves these days (not an insult its just what I have found, even for myself.)</p>

<p>Hell yeah, I hope this will be the “Fallout 2” of Fallout 3. By that, I mean bigger, better, and more bad ass!<br>

<p>That’s… concerning. However, I do agree that the boss fights were fairly weak, Behemoths were a bit too easy, even on hard mode.<br>
I think for New Vegas, that Behemoths should be suprise events, i.e. player walking down the street, Behemoth bursts through nearby building, player runs away screming OMGWTFSMB.<br>
The DLC that they (probably will) release after launch of NV, should be a lot longer than the stuff they released for 3; out of all of them, I think Broken Steel probably took the longest (in terms of all the quests (main and side quests)), and even that was easily completed in a day.</p>
<p>Also moar Vaults need to be accessible for looting etc. GARRRRYY!</p>

            <p>I’ve played only Fallout 3 and Fallout 2.</p>
<p>Fallout 2 was horrible. I quit just after dying to a scorpion I shot 6 times point blank with a magnum. It survived. It then killed me.</p>

            <p>And with G.o.G you get easy access to the soundtrack,avatars, wall papers, key map, booklet and Chris Avalones fallout bible plus its drm free and cheaper.<br>
I love steam, but thats hard to argue with.<br>
And that sound track is awsome brings back so many fond memories.</p>

            <p>Uhh… You’re aware you can also access your <a href="http://GOG.com" rel="nofollow noopener">GOG.com</a> account from anywhere you come to be, right? So you can actually download and play them wherever you want as long as you get a working internet connection (which you need for STEAM anyway).</p>
