    <description>hi

i know that black mesa will not come to any console neither 8th gen nor 9th gen but who knows what will happen in the future!

original half life came on ps2 years later! half life 2 came to ps3 years later too!

but i don&#39;t know about the rights regarding original half life remake (black mesa)

i mean does valve have to have the rights from crowbar collective to make this port?

is there any petition regarding black mesa port to consoles so i sign it? (at least it&#39;s better than nothing!)

tnx</description>
