Please sign this petition if you agree. Instead of raising negative attention, the idea is to bring the community together. If we get enough signatures, I will email this to Valve.

Also, if you know effective ways of gathering people to sign, any help would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>I’m glad that if they don’t show a trailer, then they don’t show content in it that won’t be in the game. And the less I hear people complaining about cut content or saying how much better X would be if it were Y, the happier I am.</p>

            <p>I don’t care about EP3 lack of media. They can release it in five years without infos and I still buy it. I made the same thing for HL2.<br>
If valve release new awesome games in the middle, that’s a good thing.<br>
Oh and remember : you all have a real life to carry on a,d plenty of other good games before EP3…</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, but they do allocate people between teams, depending on what they want to get done, I’d guess that L4D2 has the majority of the people ATM, where Ep3 and Portal 2 have less, and when L4D2 nears completion, they’ll shuffle more people back in the direction of EP3 and portal 2.</p>
<p>They aren’t fixed in their spot, Valve completely decides who does that and when.</p>

            <p>That article makes me wonder if it will be in the next orange box. If it is bundled with Episode 3, and Portal 2 or some other game, I’ll buy it without a complaint.</p>
