    <title>Unusual request with possible awesome repercussions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unusual-request-with-possible-awesome-repercussions/4998</link>
    <description>Alright, so I had this idea while I was bored at work:

A t-shirt design of Terminator&#39;s robotic hand doing the Vulcan hand-sign whilst holding a lightsaber (could also be a crowbar) and wearing a Green Lantern ring. The caption would read &quot;So say we all.&quot;

Now, I don&#39;t even pretend to be an artist. I can barely draw anything and my creativity only shows itself very rarely, so what I ask if anyone would be willing to draw this for me and then I would pitch the design to a t-shirt company.

Of course, something like this might have been made before but I can&#39;t honestly be arsed to search for it.

Do you think this would be possible to do?</description>

<p>Wah wah!  MY FRANCHISE! :’(:’(  Get over it, Salvation was a fun movie, and Terminator 2 was really corny and almost embarrassing at times if you think about it.</p>
<p>Also, I think the shirt idea is too damn much, and I’m not somebody who should ever have to say that.</p>

<p>Back on topic, If an image of such a combination of geek fandome were to be done, I’d say it should be the Comic-con symbol.<br>
I do have one addition, an Autobot symbol on the blade end of the lightsaber, and a Decepticon symbol on the base of the hilt.</p>

            <p>It’s supposed to be a clusterfuck of geekness, with a message of union between geeks.</p>
<p>Together we shall be stronger.</p>
<p>Also, the Terminator hand represents the franchise as a whole and not just T2.</p>

<p>Nah just a super nerdy T-shirt.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>i don’t really associate Terminator 2 with nerds, really. it’s a big-budget hollywood action film directed by James Cameron and widely considered a classic. And honestly i don’t know that there’s any overlap between Green lantern fans, Star wars nerds, Star trek nerds, etc - in fact they seem to segregate themselves - so the caption “so say we all” seems unlikely. Aside from the fact that the only thing being “said” would be “live long and prosper” which doesn’t make any sense in context.</p>
<p>On the other hand i’d like to see a recreation of the T-2 hand sinking into the lava pit, but it has two thumbs and it’s holding a peyote button, and the caption would be “Too weird to live, too rare to die.” Don’t try to rip me off, I’m copyrighting that shit, bitches.</p>

<p>You get 1 dollar for each shirt, and you’ll split the money with whoever makes it for you.</p>
<p>I’d do it but I’ve got other things to do.</p>

            <p>Alright, so I had this idea while I was bored at work:</p>
<p>A t-shirt design of Terminator’s robotic hand doing the Vulcan hand-sign whilst holding a lightsaber (could also be a crowbar) and wearing a Green Lantern ring. The caption would read “So say we all.”</p>
<p>Now, I don’t even pretend to be an artist. I can barely draw anything and my creativity only shows itself very rarely, so what I ask if anyone would be willing to draw this for me and then I would pitch the design to a t-shirt company.</p>
<p>Of course, something like this might have been made before but I can’t honestly be arsed to search for it.</p>
<p>Do you think this would be possible to do?</p>
