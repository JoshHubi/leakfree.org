    <description>Is it just me, or is logic_playerproxy completely broken in the 2015 edition of Black Mesa? It&#39;s incredibly important to the Hazard Course mod, and if we&#39;re ever going to port HC to BM 2015, this entity needs to be fixed.   :frowning:</description>

            <p>Yeah, it would be.  Kind of makes you wonder what’s happening behind the scenes which causes it to not work, since that seems like core functionality.</p>

            <p>Our script calls for the scientists to panic whenever Gordon dies for any reason, and the medkit training station is designed to open the door only after your health reaches 100. I might be able to figure out some workarounds with some experimentation, but honestly logic_playerproxy is the clearest solution for both of these cases.</p>
<p>EDIT: And also, Five Nights at the Hazard Course heavily uses the OnFlashlightOn and OnFlashlightOff outputs from logic_playerproxy, though I suppose that’s less of a priority than the Hazard Course proper.</p>

            <p>Probably.  Seems like a bug to me.  What were you intending to do with it?</p>

            <p>Should this be submitted to the Bug Report forum for completeness’ sake? I really need this to be fixed.</p>
