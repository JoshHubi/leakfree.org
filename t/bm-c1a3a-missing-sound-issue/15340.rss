    <title>bm_c1a3a missing sound issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bm-c1a3a-missing-sound-issue/15340</link>
    <description>What sound exaclty is missing:

Start chapter 5 &quot;We&#39;ve Got Hostiles&quot; (or the map bm_c1a3a), proceed to the scientist who starts saying &quot;open the silo doors&quot; and wait until the guard inside the room gets grabbed by a zombie who pulls him into the vent.
The guard is supposed to make some choking sounds but in my case he doesn&#39;t. In the console I get the following warning/error message:
[i]Failed to load sound &quot;*vo\c1a3a\silodoors\grd_zombiegrabscream.wav&quot;, file probably missing from disk/repository[/i]
The actual path to that sound file is vo\c1a3a\grd_wgh_zombiegrabscream01.wav

I&#39;ve removed the entire game, deleted the game directory manually, and re-downloaded the whole game again (&quot;stable&quot; branch, not beta or something else). I have no workshop addons installed, no manual mods or any special custom config file or something like that. The issue persists.
According to a [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/1698293255126856950/&#39;]discussion on Steam[/url] this issue is supposed to be specific to my system, but is it really?

Something else I want to mention is that the only &quot;zombiegrabscream&quot; file listed inside bm_c1a3a.manifest is the missing file mentioned in the console log.

Well, I know how to add custom stuff to the game&#39;s search path, so I can easily fix that for me, but I still wanted to let you know that. I&#39;d also like to know if I&#39;m really the only person experiencing this tiny bug.</description>

<p>And that’s weird, cause for me the guard is only screaming when I change the .txt files. Whatever, it’s a very minor thing and I would have never even realized it if I didn’t pay attention to the console log.<br>
Thanks for your replys, devs now know about it, my job is done. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey guys, debeerguy here, and I’ve looked into this on the build sources, and have found out what the deal is:</p>
<p>The sound was originally implemented as a soundevent in the qc file that complies one of the animation models. It refers to the so called soundscript “ss_open_silo_doors.ZombieGrabScream”, originally found in scripts/game_sounds_scenes.txt</p>
<p>Source Code[/size]</p>
<ol>
<li>“ss_open_silo_doors.ZombieGrabScream”</li>
<li>{</li>
<li>“channel”		“CHAN_BODY”</li>
<li>“volume”		“VOL_NORM”</li>
<li>“pitch”			“PITCH_NORM”</li>
<li>“soundlevel”		“SNDLVL_NORM”</li>
<li>“wave”			“*vo/c1a3a/SiloDoors/GRD_zombiegrabscream.wav”</li>
<li>}</li>
</ol>
<p>When I did the whole “vo soundscript conversion initiative” a few years back,  I moved and renamed this soundscript to<br>
wgh.grdroom.zombiegrabdeath01 ( game_sounds_scenes_wgh.txt ), to be used in the scene’s .vcd file instead.</p>
<p>(this is the soundscript as now intended)</p>
<p>“wgh.grdroom.zombiegrabdeath01”<br>
{<br>
“channel”“CHAN_VOICE”<br>
“volume”“0.600”<br>
“pitch”“PITCH_NORM”</p>
<p>“soundlevel” “SNDLVL_NORM”</p>
<p>“wave”“vo/c1a3a/grd_wgh_zombiegrabscream01.wav”<br>
}</p>
<p>So basically a new soundscript was made, new name given for the .wav file, and I simplified the wav directory.  (vo/c1a3a/SiloDoors/ no longer exists. )</p>
<p>The guard’s screaming sound still plays as intended (now thru the actual .vcd file) but we forgot to remove the original soundevent reference in the animation qc, and that’s part of why the console error exists.</p>
<p>Hope that helps to explain the situation.</p>
<p>I appreciate you guys being that to our attention.  While it doesn’t affect the gameplay of that scene, I’ll be sure to get the console error taken care of on our end.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Simple solution to ridding yourself of the console error  (assuming it irks you enough lol) </span> is to just delete the entry<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">“ss_open_silo_doors.ZombieGrabScream”  from  game_sounds_scenes.txt</span></p>

            <p>Deactivated Steam cloud in Steam settings. Used “Everything” to search for the app ID and deleted stuff. Made a clean reinstall of Black Mesa. Still doesn’t want to play that sound file, weird.<br>
Here the log:</p>

Failed to load sound "*vo\c1a3a\silodoors\grd_zombiegrabscream.wav", file probably missing from disk/repository</code></p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>I think I found the issue:<br>
In the bms_misc VPK file, there’s this entry in scripts/game_sounds_scenes.txt:</p>
<p>[code]“ss_open_silo_doors.ZombieGrabScream”<br>
{<br>
“channel”		“CHAN_BODY”<br>
“volume”		“VOL_NORM”<br>
“pitch”			“PITCH_NORM”<br>
“soundlevel”		“SNDLVL_NORM”<br>
“wave”			“*vo/c1a3a/SiloDoors/GRD_zombiegrabscream.wav”</p>
<p>}[/code]<br>
That’s the path my game is looking for which doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Update 2:</p>
<p>Changing the part in scripts/game_sounds_scenes.txt like this fixes the issue:</p>
<p>[code]“ss_open_silo_doors.ZombieGrabScream”<br>
{<br>
“channel”		“CHAN_BODY”<br>
“volume”		“VOL_NORM”<br>
“pitch”			“PITCH_NORM”<br>
“soundlevel”		“SNDLVL_NORM”<br>
//“wave”			“*vo/c1a3a/SiloDoors/GRD_zombiegrabscream.wav”<br>
“wave”			“vo/c1a3a/grd_wgh_zombiegrabscream01.wav”</p>
<p>}[/code]So now I’m 100% sure it’s not an issue with my PC or setup but an issue with the game, as it’s clearly looking for a file that doesn’t exist.</p>
