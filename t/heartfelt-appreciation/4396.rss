    <title>Heartfelt Appreciation</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/heartfelt-appreciation/4396</link>
    <description>I go to a lot of forums, and i tend to see that people are always good at talking crap, flaming, trolling, moaning, whining and so on. But people rarely write anything appreciative for something good others did.

But in the light of the one of the newest members in here: Gerge, who seems to get more attention than he deserves, i&#39;d like to try and remedy his foolishness:

Now i&#39;ve been in the dark concerning this mod for some time now, i&#39;ve known about it since it was announced a while back but thought it cancelled because of it&#39;s massive scope and my own lack of info hunting about it. But i&#39;m glad to see that it&#39;s still on track and looking very promising based on what i&#39;ve seen so far.

Now Gerge i&#39;m pretty sure nobody has to tell you this, but still i&#39;m gonna try and instill some common sense into your madness. First of all comparing DNF and BM is just all kinds of wrong. DNF was meant to be a commercial release, the developers had jobs that required them to make this game and they had a deadline...multiple times they failed and now the game is lost in the void again and probably wont ever see the light of day, sadly.

BM on the other hand is a community Modification, and by the looks of it a labour of love. They don&#39;t get paid (or so i think) and they have jobs besides this project (or so i think  :slight_smile: ). That means, in my opinion anyways, that they can treat this like they want to and aptly apply the tagline: &quot;it&#39;s done when it&#39;s done&quot;. I for one would rather have something worthy of an old classic, than some rushjob.

Now i know this is captain obvious stuff i&#39;ve written, people know it but i still needed to write it, and i hope it can boost morale somehow if need be. This is deffinetely a mod i want to see finished.

So thank you Black Mesa Team, thank you for revitalizing one of my fondest game experiences, and please don&#39;t let the trolls get you down.

            <p>“heartfelt” appreciation is foolish, because ultimately, it’s just a game, not the cure for cancer. but they have my gratitude.</p>

            <p>with “friends” like him who needs enemies? Did he get kicked off the project or something since there seems to be so much hatred, or is this perhaps some kind of twisted guerilla adverticing. His attitude is really off the charts.</p>

            <p>Izgol, I apreciate your coming here and trying to rectify the issue, but it’s not going to work on “garge”.</p>
<p>He is an… old “friend”. the only thing that can happen to fix him right now is a banning, so we are getting all the amusement we can out of him until such time arrives.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I go to a lot of forums, and i tend to see that people are always good at talking crap, flaming, trolling, moaning, whining and so on. But people rarely write anything appreciative for something good others did.</p>
<p>But in the light of the one of the newest members in here: Gerge, who seems to get more attention than he deserves, i’d like to try and remedy his foolishness:</p>
<p>Now i’ve been in the dark concerning this mod for some time now, i’ve known about it since it was announced a while back but thought it cancelled because of it’s massive scope and my own lack of info hunting about it. But i’m glad to see that it’s still on track and looking very promising based on what i’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>Now Gerge i’m pretty sure nobody has to tell you this, but still i’m gonna try and instill some common sense into your madness. First of all comparing DNF and BM is just all kinds of wrong. DNF was meant to be a commercial release, the developers had jobs that required them to make this game and they had a deadline…multiple times they failed and now the game is lost in the void again and probably wont ever see the light of day, sadly.</p>
<p>BM on the other hand is a community Modification, and by the looks of it a labour of love. They don’t get paid (or so i think) and they have jobs besides this project (or so i think  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ). That means, in my opinion anyways, that they can treat this like they want to and aptly apply the tagline: “it’s done when it’s done”. I for one would rather have something worthy of an old classic, than some rushjob.</p>
<p>Now i know this is captain obvious stuff i’ve written, people know it but i still needed to write it, and i hope it can boost morale somehow if need be. This is deffinetely a mod i want to see finished.</p>
<p>So thank you Black Mesa Team, thank you for revitalizing one of my fondest game experiences, and please don’t let the trolls get you down.</p>
