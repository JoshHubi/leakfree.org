            <p>I think everyone is sort of used to it now. I’m not saying that Microsoft all out copied this song from LBP, but what are the chances of such a rarely head song being used like this twice. Also, the graphic design just looks very similar.</p>
<p>In all fairness though, no one should really care too much, and even 360 fanboys can’t deny that Microsoft do like taking…inspiration…for their ideas.</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything about preferring either console.  I think they are both fine.</p>

<p>normal people care to as well as both microsoft and sony fanboys. and the comercial reminds me verry much of exactly lbp if i turn the volume off</p>
