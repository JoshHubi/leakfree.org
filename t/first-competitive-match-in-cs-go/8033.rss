America VS Europe.

I am a big fan of CS series, and GOD THEY GOT RID OF TAPPING.

That means no more crazy AR shots like they did. 

However, they still put in the quickscopes, making the sniper rifles very versatile, yet expensive to use.

I kinda like this, and not like this at the same time. 

What are your opinions?</description>

            <p>When you play 5v5 competitively, you don’t rush every round, or even that often at all. So it’d cost a lot more than its worth for the CT’s do use them every round.</p>

            <p>Saw that match a few days ago. I hope that Counter Terrorists can’t get Molotovs, that would completely stop T rushes like on Dust2 at B. Seems like it’d be overpowered unless used by T’s for defending the bomb.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I never liked CS’s gameplay that much so any changes to make it more in line with current shooters would be a plus in my book.</p>

            <p>Any mayor changes in gameplay would lead into Call of Duty /Battlefield / Halo / Crysis 2.</p>

            <p>Well to be honest, judging by how many people never switched to Source and stuck with 1.6 I think valve is perfectly fine in their fear.</p>
<p>Also although CS is technically another modern based shooter, it manages to have a very unique feel in its pacing and gameplay.  I think if they tried to change it they’d just end up making more bland.</p>

            <p>That’s because it is. It seems Valve is afraid to radically revamp the franchise just like they did with Team Fortress.</p>
