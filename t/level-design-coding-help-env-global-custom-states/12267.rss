    <title>[Level Design/Coding Help] env_global Custom States?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/level-design-coding-help-env-global-custom-states/12267</link>
    <description>I was decompiling some of Valve&#39;s maps today to check out their entity setup on d2_coast_07 and 08, because in those two maps is the train bridge sequence where a button pressed in one map deactivates a field in the other. My original theory was that the state was controlled by a logic relay of some kind that was retained in the level transition between maps. However, this was proven to be invalidated, as the button actually toggled on an env_global with a custom state on it.

You see, the &quot;normal&quot; env_global states are as follows:

Gordon pre-criminal
Antlions are player allies
Suit sprint function not yet enabled
Super phys gun is enabled
Friendly encounter sequence (lower weapons, etc.)
Gordon is invulnerable
Don&#39;t spawn seagulls on the jeep
Episode 2: Alyx injured
Episodic: Alyx darkness mode
Ep2 Counter: Hunters to run over before they dodge

These are code functions related to a specific area of the game or a modified AI state. HOWEVER, the env_global in d2_coast_08 has the following state:

bridge_gate_open

WAT. I&#39;ve never seen this state before, but it is used to control the open and closed status of the bridge&#39;s laser gate in map 07. My only real hypothesis here is that either A. the developers intentionally programmed in a state specific to this part of the game that cannot be used any other way (a valid possibility but seemingly a waste of resources), or B. they hacked in their own state to the env_global and I can totally do something similar.

If I somehow had a way to make custom env_global states, this could [b]massively[/b] reduce the complexity of the entity setups required to keep track of the variables influencing world state in each map. Does anyone here know anything about custom states in env_global or where in the code to look? Any help would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>Yeah you can just type directly into the dropbown field to set your own state.</p>

            <p>You can make custom env_global states. I think you just have to type into the “global state to set” textbox rather than choose a drop-down option, though it’s been a while since I’ve messed around with them.<br>
EDIT:<br>
<a href="https://twhl.info/tutorial.php?id=108" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This</a> is for Goldsource, but it should work about the same in Source, just with the I/O system instead of single-target triggers.</p>
