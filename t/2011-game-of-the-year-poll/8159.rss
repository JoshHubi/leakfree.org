    <title>2011 Game of the Year poll</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/2011-game-of-the-year-poll/8159</link>
    <description>So this year is finally coming to an end and it has been an awesome one for video games. So many amazing games have come out and I haven&#39;t had a life for the entire year.

Now that all the big releases are finally out or about to come out, what games do you guys think are GOTY worthy, and what game do you want to win?

IMO, the best games of the year were without a doubt Skyrim, Portal 2, The Witcher 2, Arkham City, Skyward Sword, Deus Ex, and Battlefield 3.

I can&#39;t really say anything about games like Uncharted or Gears of War 3 because I haven&#39;t played them.

Out of all those games, I think Skyrim is going to and should win GOTY, but if Skyrim didn&#39;t win, I&#39;d be happy if the Witcher or Portal 2 did.

Any other predictions for GOTY winners? What were your favorite games and why?</description>

<p>Xalener, if you’re thinking in an objectivist way, yeah overrated is a retarded term, but there are things that end up getting popular that shouldn’t, or that overshadow other ideas that are better. CoD is overrated, sure it’s had a massive influence on the FPS genre, but seriously, it has been literally the exact same game for 5 releases in a row. People literally just buy it because of the name.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree, but I have to say “things that end up getting popular that shouldn’t, or that overshadow other ideas that are better” doesn’t hold much water no matter how much I agree. I could come up with a million reasons why the idea of the  killstreak is flawed and terrible, but I’m sure someone else could come up with even more reasons why it’s a good one.</p>
<p>Look, the last thing I want to do here is defend COD. Can we cut this off?</p>

            <p>That’s not what I’m implying at all. What I’m saying is, no one has a say in what’s good or bad for anyone other than themselves. It’s because of this that words like “overrated” are just plain retarded. Fuck, even in my crysis 2 rant up there I kept it self contained. I know it’s loved, and I know why it’s loved. Those positive qualities are no consolation for me. Same goes for everything else I don’t like.</p>
<p>As much as I hate what COD is fundamentally, I cannot deny that it has greatly influenced the current generation of shooters by popularizing a deeper set of first person mechanics like Aiming down sights and sprinting. And I can’t deny that killstreaks and perks have become popular since COD4’s release, despite my hangups on what they do to a multiplayer game.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I know that. I like the mods as thats the main reason I like half-life, the large expansive mod base. But, if that’s the case you could say that the CoD :MW series is the best game in the world(when we all know it’s not) because of it’s large player-base that likes and buys every game that is released with over 5mil sold around launch and more later on.</p>

            <p>That’s not up to any single person to judge. Maybe for ones self, but that’s it. It really comes down to how influential it’s been down the line, and that’s quite a bit. Especially in the mod scene.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I just couldn’t think of another term. I mean it looks cool and all, but like Half-Life it’s a cool game but it’s placed on a pedestal as the pest game in history, when it’s not.</p>

            <p>Overrated is a stupid fucking term. It implies the user thinks he knows better than hundreds and thousands of others, and that somehow those people don’t deserve to enjoy something as much as they do.</p>
<p>Not directed at you, just had to get that off my chest. Well it was, but I had to get that off my chest.</p>

</aside>
<p>Eh? I never hinted at that I don’t think.<br>
In fact, I said it sucked on all platforms and specifically noted that it was NOT smooth even running on high (low) at over 60fps on the pc.</p>
<p>Plus, adding a character that magically is the origin of everything does not equate to adding depth. Well it does, but it does in the same way throwing a grenade in a lake is fishing. Hargreve was magically the solution to every problem in crysis 1. He was the plug in every plothole. The silver bullet. He was fucking EASY. He started the nanosuit program, knew about the ceph, AND knew how to defeat them! What does it set him up for? some moving speeches. A few tough choice moments… Well, illusions of choices. You’re a fucking puppet in the game, which thankfully is justified again by Hargreve always knowing what’s right. Pull a Halo 2 and give the dead guy in the last game a magical daughter that was always there, which automatically sets us up with a character that has a grudge. Easy. And then there’s the military guy whose name I forget because his character was just trash. He was the captain from the first game recycled. Rabid military man with no regard for logic and just happens to have a lot of muscle. Eeeeeeeeeaaaaassssyyyyyy.</p>
<p>Open endedness or linearity doesn’t really matter to me. Ergonomics is the most important thing in a level, and whether or not that means linearity could go either way. What matters to me is the placement of the enemy, and their inclination to move. If they’re all in front of me and I NEVER get flanked, then as a shooter the game is a failure. If The enemy does not evade my fire, the game as a shooter is a failure. If the enemies move stiffly from point to point, providing easy targets for me, the game as a shooter is a failure.</p>
<p>I really don’t care if I’m fighting in a box or in a jagged landscape full of tactical opportunities. If I don’t believe I’m fighting an enemy, then fuck it all. If the game can’t give me a good enough excuse to fight these drones, then fuck it more. The only fun I had in the first game came from fucking around a bit in vehicles and picking shit up and throwing it. Most of my fun in crysis has nothing to do with playing the actual game. When they trimmed all the fat in crysis 2, they also trimmed all the good parts of crysis. They got rid of the bullshit which was for me the best part, because as a shooter… there’s just SO much fundamentally wrong with the game. It’s as clunky as a fucking 20 pound toolbox. It’s as ergonomic as a miniature cactus. It’s not a game. It’s a fucking chore. That’s what it feels like.</p>
<p>…But back on topic. Knee arrows.</p>

            <p>I never had any problem keeping the vehicles in Crysis 1 alive (though the tank level was kind of annoying, mostly because I didn’t realize it had finite ammo until I was out). The VTOL level did glitch on me though and I had to restart it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Lacks in story? Crysis 2 had a rather interesting plot revolving around the ethics of transhumanism, it took the rather lackluster story of the first game and made it far more complex than it had any right to be, and on the whole the gameplay improved with the addition of proper stealth kills. Human Revolution the plot is not, but it still kept things interesting.</p>
<p>Crysis 1’s level design in terms of openness was hardly non-linear compared to Crysis 2’s- Just because there are more trees doesn’t mean you necessarily have more tactical options. I’d say that they’re approximately equal- in Crysis 1 you had the forest to navigate and could approach areas from many different angles, but little in the way of verticality. Crysis 2 had rooftops and sewers you could use to sneak around and flank with, <span class="bbcode-b">maximizing</span> the potential of the new stealth-kill system. I also immensely like the ability to trick out the suit with Ceph upgrades throughout the game, adding new abilities and features to further customize your play style.</p>
<p>Crysis 1 began to falter around the midpoint when the Koreans get their asses kicked by a flash freeze and you’re left fighting aliens for the rest of the game. These areas were problematic because A. the levels got more linear, B. the aliens weren’t fun to fight at all, and C. the carrier fight at the end was a chore. Mercifully, the XBLA/PSN version of C1 left out “Ascension,” the much derided VTOL shooting level from the PC original, because admit it, it sucked. Crysis 2 thankfully kept the vehicle usage short and sweet, whereas in Crysis 1 keeping any sort of vehicle in decent repair was a difficult chore.</p>
<p>I won’t make any sorts of comparisons to Battlefield 3 because I unfortunately haven’t played it yet. I’m just saying, don’t badmouth the sequel so heavily for it’s console-focused development, particularly when said limitations ultimately made for smoother, more focused gameplay.</p>
<p>Also, on C1’s port for the PSN, I definitely missed the Speed mode from C1PC. The levels are still just as open as the PC version and having only C2’s sprint function made navigation slower than it needed to be. They shouldn’t have tried to mix the two styles- they either should have faithfully adapted all four modes of C1’s Nanosuit 1.0, or they should have adapted the stealth kills and expanded options of C2’s Nanosuit 2.0.</p>

<p>lol</p>
<p>Also, dude. Crysis’s story is horrible. It’s shit now and it was shit in 2007. The acting is bad, the writing is bad, the characters are more 1 dimensional than a fucking sock… It’s just a shit story. That’s it, bro. It’s an abominable half assed mashup of Akira and Starship Troopers, except nowhere near as cool as that would sound.</p>
<p>And the suit voice… God what did they do? It was actually pretty badass in the first Crysis with the accent, now it sounds like some dude from Wisconsin. Oh, and the orders. Blah blah blah. You get NO choices Alky. None at all. Break the padlock alcatraz, here’s some tactical suggestions alcatraz, take the syringe alcatraz YOU FUCKING SUCKER!</p>
<p>What Crysis 2 lacks in story it more than makes up for in lens flare, I’ll give it that. But it looses several points for insane input lag across all platforms no matter what graphical setting. Crysis 2 is hardly a game. It feels more like the Movie adaptation of GI Joe than an interactive game. As an aspiring developer, I frequently boot up the shitpiece to remind myself what not to do. That’s what the game is to me. It’s not a fucking game, it’s a learning subject. A collection of mistakes that I can learn to avoid.</p>
<p>Either way, people are challenging your opinion because it is routed in unfounded bias and ignorance. If feels more like you’re lying to yourself than you actually believe Crysis 2 is good.</p>
<p>I mean I’m not gonna defend Battlefield 3’s story, because it’s not the best either. I mean the characters were interesting, but they blew by like nothing at all. Nothing in the campaign really felt important either. There was an awfully low suspense level for a story about the impending detonation of a nuke in one of America’s largest cities. It was a breath of fresh air though, with the Russians being the good guys for once, and the terrorists having a sense of vulnerability instead of being “those animals across the ocean” that they are portrayed as in games nowadays. It had some really good concepts, they just weren’t executed very well.</p>
