    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-game-are-you-looking-forward-to-the-most/8770</link>
    <description>So, what game are you guys Eagerly anticipating  this year? 

For me its a tie between Bioshock Infinite and Halo 4.


Dishonored looks pretty good but I haven&#39;t seen any gameplay, so I cant really get excited about it.</description>

            <p>You guys probably never heard of it, but this game/mod called Black Mesa Source, gonna be awesome. Even though the devs are quiet, I know they’re cooking up something good.</p>
<p>…but in all seriousness.<br>
Borderlands 2, Halo 4, Guild Wars 2, and Counter-Strike: GO.<br>
I’m kinda waiting on Darksiders 2, but I got so close to beating the first one and then I lost all my save data and I really don’t feel like doing all of it over again.</p>

            <p>After seeing footage of and finding info about it, I’d definitely say Planetside 2 as well. The idea of 2000 players in an all out futuristic war with battlefield-like gameplay, but larger is just hugely appealing to me.</p>
<p>Also the official steam release of Natural Selection 2 (because it will have all the main features by then), Max Payne 3 in a couple of days, and Path of Exile’s next open beta because they will be adding the next Act to the game.</p>

            <p>Planetside 2 mostly at the moment. It just seems like something I’ve always wanted to play.</p>

            <p>Anyone that says Half-Life 3 can’t really say that, because it isn’t an “upcoming game”  because it hasn’t really been announced.</p>
<p>Well anyway I am actually waiting for CS: GO, DOTA 2, Black Ops 2, Dishonored, Halo 4,  GTAV, and Asscreed 3, plus the four mods in my sig, and a couple of other mods, like Op4 2 and such.</p>

            <p>That’s far from every upcoming game. Also, looking forward to =/= favorite.</p>
<p>All games on that list may very well be disappointing. Except Max Payne 3, which I already have pre-ordered.</p>

            <p>Bioshock Infinite got delayed to next year btw.</p>
<p>Anyway I am looking forward to GTA 5 if it comes out this year.  Also Assassin’s Creed II and Borderlands 2 the most.</p>

            <p>Planetside was the first and only MMO that I was ever really interested in. Planetside 2 is the new exception. I never had so much fun with an online game as I did with Planetside.</p>
