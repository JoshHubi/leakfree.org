    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suicidemouse-avi/2740</link>
    <description>Has anyone heard of suicidemouse.avi? Well I just read it&#39;s story, it&#39;s frightening, I&#39;m horrified to sleep now, I can&#39;t even imagine how scary the actually video is, so this thread is just to discuss the video if you&#39;ve seen it and what you think of it, the real origin of it&#39;s name is from one night where they were planning a DVD with the 30&#39;s cartoons. It froze in black until the 6th minute until everything turned into an apocalyptic mess, with a horrifying screech. The guy watching it decided to get another employee to finish it, after it was done he kept saying something about the seen and unseen seven times, then he made a remark about the film, relating it to hell, it wasn&#39;t long before the man stole a guard&#39;s gun and shot himself in the face.  It&#39;s a scary story if you hear it from better sources. 

Just post what you know and your thoughts about the story and video.</description>
