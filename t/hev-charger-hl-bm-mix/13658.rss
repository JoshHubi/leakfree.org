    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hev-charger-hl-bm-mix/13658</link>
    <description>Hey guys! I&#39;ve been messing around with the old and the new HEV charging sounds. I remastered the old 8-bit wav files from the original HL to sound &#39;highdef&#39; and after a couple hours of tweaking around with the effects - here&#39;s what I got. It&#39;s not much, but lemme know what you think, and how I could improve it.  :slight_smile:

EDIT REPOST:

Thanks for the feedback guys! I bought Adobe Audition CC a week ago and I&#39;ve been playing around with a lot of the BM files to learn my way around the program. Today, I finally finished a mix of the Health HEV charger. This one took much more work as I had to deEffer the &#39;Hum&#39; out of the BM file. I opted to to keep the &#39;hum&#39; from the original HL health recharger because... well I like it better lol  :stuck_out_tongue:  

Anyways, tell me what you think of these. I&#39;m quite proud of the &#39;health_okay.wav&#39; - it was incredibly hard to phase out the undertone hum, and even harder to get the original HL health charger to sound somewhat highdef.

<p>It has potential, but personally I don’t like it. The charging sound is good, but it could really stand a reduction in volume in my opinion. I don’t think the charge declined sound is that good though; the double noise doesn’t really work well (or at least I don’t think so) and the click at the end just isn’t necessary. Maybe mix it in with the rest of the sound? Like I said, it seems like it could be good but it needs work.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, keep in mind that I’m trying to mix the old sounds with the new. In the original HL (maybe this was only the PS2 version as that’s the only version I played until I bought my first PC in 2007) whenever you would try to charge your HEV suit on an empty charger - it would make that buzz twice. I believe, it was only supposed to do it once, however, since the sound file is so short - you would hold the button down long enough for it to play twice.</p>
<p>So the double buzz was me trying to replicate that. As for the click at the end - that’s the BM sound… the only sound. When you try to charge on an empty charging station - it clicks (probably replicating the sound of the shutter closing). Since I’m mixing old with new - I thought it appropriate to add that click. Otherwise - it’s just a moderately remastered version of the HL sound.</p>
<hr>
<p>As for the replacement Health Charging station - I have to receive feedback on that. If someone could input - it would be greatly appriciated  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Also - in all honesty. I’d like there to be three sound clips for both the HEV charger, and the Health station. One for HEVcharge/Health Station beginning, one for you emptying the station - and another for an already used station that’s empty.</p>
<p>If someone could help me out with the scripting for that - I think I could do much better than this  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>For the ‘Suit Charge No’ I liked the two buzzes, but felt they could be moved closer to the two chirps that preceded them, and I disliked the final click that came at the end.<br>
For the ‘Suit Charge Yes’ I liked the tonally shifting humming, but felt the accompanying buzz could be toned down a bit.</p>
