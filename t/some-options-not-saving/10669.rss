    <title>Some options not saving</title>

    <description>Some of the options under the &quot;Black Mesa&quot; tab in the options window are not saving properly.  The ones I noticed while playing were auto-aim and view roll, which reset to on every time I restarted the game even though I turned them off every time.  There may be others but I didn&#39;t change most of the options.</description>
