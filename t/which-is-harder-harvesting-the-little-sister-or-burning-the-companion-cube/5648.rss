    <title>Which is harder, harvesting the Little Sister or burning the Companion cube</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/which-is-harder-harvesting-the-little-sister-or-burning-the-companion-cube/5648</link>
    <description>I read on portals wiki that some players stated that they had more trouble burning the companion cube. Ive played both BioshocK and Portal and from my experience what i did was harvest the Little sisters without remorse while when GLaDOS told me i had to burn the companion cube I sat there for ten minutes muttering to my self saying &quot;theres got to be another way&quot;, so which one is harder for you</description>

<p>You get attached to it if you want to. I couldn’t stop laughing when the computer voice tried to make me get attached to the cube and to make me feel bad about destroying it. Getting actually attached to a cube with a pink heart on its 6 faces? Come on, wake up, it’s a fucking joke!</p>

<p>That’s actually my point. It IS ridiculous. But it still happens. I actually kinda got a little attatched to Dog’s Ball in HL2 when I took it to Ravenholm. Dog’s Ball, though, is a lot more excusable to become attatched to… considering it moves and makes noise, whereas the companion cube… sits there.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure the reason why some people feel more guilty when killing the companion cube, is because they actually develop an attatchment to it. The way the game introduces the companion cube makes it sort of feel like the companion cube is alive. There is only one companion cube, it can never be replaced, Little Sisters, on the other hand, come and go. Besides, the companion cube will never threaten to stab you. The little sisters command giant men in scuba gear to drill you a new one.</p>

            <p>I can’t say. i mean sure the lil sisters had a personality, but chell woulda been creamed without companion cube! and not ONCE did it try to stab me in the back  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  it didn’t talk either but hey! i woulda felt kinda crappy bout throwin to the fire. I used the lil sisters when i needed them. Felt bad sumtimes, but oh well. i stood around waiting for a different chance to “dispose” of the cube, but it never came. Atleast u had a choice with sisters  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  so if i had to choose, i wuld go with the box cuz it didnt have that chance.</p>

            <p>As stated before, I too searched for an alternate way to complete Chamber 17 to no avail, so I just burned it. Never played Bioshock 2. I own it, but it’s on the 360 so it’s just sitting on the shelf. If I did play however, I would probably save them, but then play through again and harvest 'em with no remorse. Very few games/tv shows/songs/movies have made me remorse for deaths really.</p>

            <p>I looked for a way to not kill the companion cube but failed to find one so I just burned it.  Gotta do what ya gotta do.  As far as little sisters I usually play as the good guy to begin with so I didn’t have issues with it later but when I did do it I know that its just a game.</p>

<p>Companion cube was just a tool to beat the game.  The little sisters on the other hand, I saved all of them.  If I accidentally harvested one, I would revert to my last save (no matter how far back it was).</p>

</aside>
<p>You are like me. Whenever there is someone innocent inside the game, I end up doing whatever I can to save it. Never played Bioshock, though.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that part in Portal with the companion cube, I always imagined that as a joke, just like the line “the cake is a lie”. It’s a joke, not something for you to really care.</p>

            <p>Obviously the cube is harder. I mean, it’s a small puzzle, while harvesting the little sisters can be done at the touch of a button.<br>

<p>yeah,but they don’t knew what they were doing…but for me I think one of the mosts harder thinks to do in a games is (GOD OF WAR SPOILER) in god of war:chains of olympus ,at the end of the game,you discover that you can’t stay with your daughter,so you have to leave her for behind ,and you have to tip 0 repeatedly to leave her…this is…realy sad  (SPOILER  END)</p>
