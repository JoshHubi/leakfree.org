    <title>Crash at the near end of Residue Processing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-at-the-near-end-of-residue-processing/10310</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I have a big problem, which is stopping me from reaching the next chapter &quot;Questionable Ethics&quot;. At the near end of &quot;Residue Processing&quot; after you climbed up the ladder from the hazardous area with the barnacles at the ceiling I am walking towards the next Loading-Screen. It loads a few seconds but then crashes. &quot;hl2.exe has stopped working&quot;. And then I am back on the desktop... I tried reinstalling, noclipping, mapchanging, nothing worked.
Latest drivers are installed. 

Anybody the same crash or has someone a solving? I would really appreciate that.
I am glad for every response.
Below is the minidump-crash-file for that.

            <p>Thank you. I believe I tried this before and it crashed while loading the map, but I am not entirely sure if I tried this map… But thanks for your reply <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I had the same problem. If you don’t mind missing the very end of “Residue Processing” you can do what I did.</p>
<p>Go to ‘Settings’, ‘Keyboard’, ‘Advanced’ and activate ‘Enable developer console’.</p>
<p>Press the ` key whilst in game, type ‘sv_cheats 1’, to activate cheats. Then type ‘MAP c2a4h.bsp’ and it will load the start of “Questionable Ethics”.</p>
