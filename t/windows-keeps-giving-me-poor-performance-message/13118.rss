    <title>Windows keeps giving me poor performance message</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-keeps-giving-me-poor-performance-message/13118</link>
    <description>So every once in awhile Windows will give me a pop up saying that my computer&#39;s performance is slow and would I like to turn off aero. Apparently this is triggered when you get low on vram from a few searches I did but I&#39;m not using any vram at all looking at PrecisionX. Does anyone know why it could be telling me this if none of my monitoring software shows any issues? I&#39;d prefer not to just turn it off but I don&#39;t want it popping up every few hours when there&#39;s nothing wrong.</description>

            <p>Yeah, a quick Google search says basically there is no way except to disable Aero, which cannot be done on windows 8, also turn off wallpaper slide show(change to static wallpaper that never changes on its own) and update the games/drivers in case they had a memory leak.</p>
<p>edit: A more detailed Google search brought me to<a href="https://www.sevenforums.com/performance-maintenance/69652-how-do-i-disable-annoying-performance-color-scheme-popup-2.html#post2106908" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this message</a>:</p>

            <p>My computer isn’t really low end though and like I said it’s using pretty much no resources. Sometimes I do set it to turn off when playing games but you can’t seem to do that for 64 bit games.</p>
<p>I’ll try some of the stuff you mentioned Orpheon. I’ve had a few times recently where my computer apparently lost power and that’s shown up in the event log but occasionally there are just surges here and there so I don’t think that’s strange really. And I haven’t installed anything new that I would think would cause anything like this.</p>
<p>Edit: I also want to make sure I point out that this isn’t common but it does happen. I think I’ve seen it 3-4 times in the last few months.</p>

            <p>Hmm. I’ve never encountered that particular issue before. Are you having any other problems? Are you seeing errors in your event log? When did this start occurring? Was it after you installed something in particular? Often times when you start seeing weird issues, it coincides with something else that was installed (intentionally or otherwise). You might try uninstalling any recently installed programs, and if that fixes it, install them one by one again, giving time between each one to see which one causes the issue. You could also try a virus scan, though I haven’t heard of any malware causing this to happen before.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, I’d also try running some additional hardware diagnostics, particularly on your RAM and hard drive. Memtest86+ is a good free memory tester, just let it run overnight since some memory problems can come up rather infrequently but still cause problems. Seagate and Western Digital both offer free HDD diagnostics that can be made into bootable disks or run from Windows, with those make sure to run long tests.</p>

            <p>So every once in awhile Windows will give me a pop up saying that my computer’s performance is slow and would I like to turn off aero. Apparently this is triggered when you get low on vram from a few searches I did but I’m not using any vram at all looking at PrecisionX. Does anyone know why it could be telling me this if none of my monitoring software shows any issues? I’d prefer not to just turn it off but I don’t want it popping up every few hours when there’s nothing wrong.</p>
