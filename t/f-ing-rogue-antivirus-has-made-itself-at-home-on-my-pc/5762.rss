            <p>Once a system is compromised with that kind of virus I usually cut my losses, boot linux from a live CD, copy anything I need over to a spare HDD and reinstall windows.</p>
<p>You can never trust a compromised system again after a virus like this imo. You can’t be sure what kind of holes it’s left behind or what other nasties you have lurking in your system.</p>
<p>Also I never do any online banking or any serious purchases in windows, always use the linux live CD as it’s impossible for malware to install itself. May be overkill but at least it’s safe.</p>
<p>EDIT - If you create an image of the disk on a regular basis reinstallation of windows is pretty simple and quick. I use <a href="https://clonezilla.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Clonezilla</a> but there are other free tools out there.</p>

            <p>I had that f*ing virus a few weeks ago (on 2 different computers!). Here’s how I managed to remove it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find where the virus files are located. For me it was<br>
C:\Documents and Settings*user name*\Local Settings\Application Data<br>
Some of these folders are hidden so make sure to enable hidden file display.<br>
If you try directly deleting those files you’ll see the virus won’t let you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download this little .exe file : <a href="https://net-studio.org/patch/Removal_Tool_For_Security_Tool_V2.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://net-studio.org/patch/Removal_Tool_For_Security_Tool_V2.zip</a><br>
Unfortunatly the virus won’t let you unzip and run the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trick was : I noticed that when you start your computer, you have a few seconds before the virus appears. During this time , you can unzip and run the file.<br>
When you run the file a small window appear where you simply have to click “delete”.<br>
The time to do this (when the computer is just starting) is very short (we’re talking 2-3 seconds), so you may need to reboot your computer several times. Basically, do this : reboot-unzip-reboot-run file &amp; click delete as fast as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once this is done it is <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> over (if you restart your computer the virus will be back). What’s left to do is : go back to where the virus files are located, and delete any remaining virus file (this time you <span class="bbcode-i">will</span> be able to do it).<br>
After that it should be gone for good.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It took me about 3 hours to get rid of it the first time, then I used the same method when my 2nd computer caught the virus and it worked just fine and didn’t take too long.</p>

            <p>Well… so much for my smarty pants “oh look, a thread for computer help I might be able to help with” posts.</p>
<p>I wasnt the last person on the computer, but now it seems we cannot run any programs. Click an icon, it thinks about it and then no go. Click on an executable, it thinks about it and then no go. I even put the puter in safe mode and tried to run anything… even an antivirus… no go.  Even a restore didnt help.</p>
<p>Funny thing is that it will let me run cmd, regedit and some other basic stuff without a problem.  I also know that it has been trying to install updates that I kept putting off.  I wonder if my oldest was surfin porn last night when all of us were tucked in bed.</p>

            <p>Yeah, start ‘msconfig’ and check if anything suspicious is set to start on startup, check the file paths, go browse there and look for suspicious files… That’s how I hunt malicious stuff when my AV has trouble.</p>
<p>Most annoying malware I had kept replicating itself using random file names like hadadfj.dll in the system32 folder. It would copy itself as soon as my antivirus detected it.</p>

<p>The same thing happended to me; but it happended this way. Some damn self installing AV spyware virus got into my system. On normal I scanned several times and later when I was gonna install a skin for counter strike I found a FAKE system 32 folder, so I deleted it and the next day when I started my PC it was gone.</p>

            <p>I would advise anyone having difficulty in getting rid of a persistant self-replicating or self-installing virus or malware program, (or indeed <span class="bbcode-i">any </span> infection), to ask for help on the Spybot Safer-Networking Malware Removal Forum at:</p>
<p><a href="https://forums.spybot.info/forumdisplay.php?f=22" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.spybot.info/forumdisplay.php?f=22</a></p>
<p>After you submit details of your problem, (making sure you follow the instructions in the “BEFORE YOU POST” sticky), a member of the team will give you a detailed step-by-step method for safely removing all traces of infection from your system.</p>
<p>This can take a bit of time, but believe me it’s time well spent.</p>

<p>I had a serious virus on my windows xp pc last month.</p>
<p>I tried to remove it with everything I could think of, but there were a lot of registry keys that were affected.</p>
<p>The antivirus and antispyware removed them, but they were still there when I rebooted. I deleted them manually, but the same thing happened.</p>
<p>What finally saved me was installing Comodo firewall. It sandboxed the applications that were trying to run, and blocked the harmful registry entries. Then I did a couple rescans with the antivirus and antispyware, got rid of all remnants and rebooted. Now it works perfectly.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  <span class="bbcode-b">comodo firewall </span>+ malwarebytes + avira or avast = saved me.</p>
<p>They are all free products.</p>
<p>here’s the link for the firewall <a href="https://personalfirewall.comodo.com/free-download.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://personalfirewall.comodo.com/free-download.html</a></p>

            <p>The Hijackthis program is only if you know what you’re doing, the rest is easy.</p>
<p>Before you give up. Just try those first two steps that I listed. Download Smitfraudfix and go into Safe Mode.</p>
<p>To get into Safe Mode, restart computer and while it’s booting up (before it goes into windows) keep tapping F8 on the keyboard until you see a screen with a bunch of white text. Using the arrow keys select Safe Mode (without networking) and press enter. Let it load, hit yes on the warning message and run smitfraudfix. Press 2 to clean. Agree to the registry cleaning and the deleting of temp files.</p>
<p>You can also try and use your Malwarebytes program in Safe Mode. Alot more likely to work with it being in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>Then restart and see if it’s gone.</p>

            <p>Been fixing Rogue Antispyware/ Antiviruses for years on PCs.</p>
<p>My fix order is as follows:</p>
<p>Download Smitfraudfix, CWShredder, Hijackthis (only if you know what you are doing), Spybot, Avast.</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot into Safe Mode (without networking)</li>
<li>Launch Smitfraudfix. Press 2 for clean. Also, let it clean registry and temp files.</li>
<li>Run CWShredder.<br>
ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING -&gt;&gt; 4. Run Hijackthis and delete entries that don’t belong &lt;&lt;- ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING</li>
<li>Immunize with Spybot, Scan and remove everything with spybot, change to advanced mode and uncheck all startup entries to be safe, and after threat is eliminated, turn things on you need slowly)</li>
<li>Then run a boot scan with Avast.</li>
<li>in CMD run “sfc /scannow” with your Windows install disc in the drive. This will check and replace any altered windows system files.</li>
</ol>
<p>If it still doesn’t work, I’d say backup and reformat.</p>

            <p>ok update: the issue is that malwarebytes isn’t actually deleting the software. it says it has, but when I reboot it’s there as if nothing’s happened.</p>

            <p>I printed out and followed that page to the letter and I didnt have to do a system restore or anything. You just have to keep it from launching, then kill it, then burn the left over carcasses all over your computer.</p>
<p>If it helps, when you boot up, cntl alt delete right away as soon as you get to your desktop, and then kill anything in the task manager that starts to launch that looks goofy.  Killing it from running and replicating itself should help you at least get access to the computer to start getting rid of some of the crap.</p>

            <p>ok, I shoulda done this before: what <span class="bbcode-i">hasn’t</span> worked so far-<br>
-I has malwarebytes already, I can only access it in safe mode (with networking) where I run diagnostics and try to delete it and it says it’s got rid of the virus, but when I go back to normal nothing’s happened. so anything along those lines won’t work.<br>
-I’ve tried deleting the files but again, only safe mode works, and they’re simply not there.</p>
<p>Todo-<br>
-Catz’, idea.<br>
-full system clensing via a reinstall of windows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, Turn off your system restore. (it actually helps in retention of virus problems)</p>
<p>Second, boot into safe mode with networking and install Malwarebytes Anti-malware.</p>
<p>Make sure the software is fully updated with definitions and run a full system scan.</p>
<p>Remove any infections.</p>
<p>Reboot back into safe mode and repeat scans untill malwarebytes sees that the system is clean. Most of the time, malwarebytes is good enough to kill most rogue AVs.</p>
<p>If problems persist, you may have a rootkit. Look into ComboFix. I have had the most luck with it.</p>
<p>If problems still occur after that, I would reccomend a Kaspersky Rescue disc in the form of either USB or CD. What it is, is a scanner that uses a live Linux OS so the files on the hard drive cannot execute to bring the infection back on system startup.</p>
<p>Lastly, Stop clicking on ads on websites… Thats where they come from.</p>
<p>Also, Always make sure you have windows, flash, java, and adobe reader up to date… I get all sorts of machines into our school IT department that are behind on a service pack release and it makes it all the more difficult to get rid of infections.</p>

</aside>
<p>I was going to suggest my usual virus removal techniques, but this seems to be a tl;dnr version of what I was going to say-simply bludgeon it with every free (&amp; TRUSTED) antivirus program until the problem goes away, then uninstall all the annoying ass antivirus stuff. and for future reference and advice, the best antivirus is common sense.</p>
