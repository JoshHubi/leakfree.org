    <title>VOX captions/Blast Pit Valves</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vox-captions-blast-pit-valves/13934</link>
    <description>Found two bugs so far in Black Mesa that apparently haven&#39;t been mentioned:

1. Excluding Inbound, there seem to be no captions for VOX, at least until the rocket launch (I&#39;m beginning Apprehension right now).

2. In the Oxygen and Fuel room, the second valve (the one hidden in the room) appears to not be required to set it on. Not sure if it was intentional or not but it kinda renders that part of the puzzle pointless.</description>
