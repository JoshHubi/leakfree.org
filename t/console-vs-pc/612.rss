    <description>Which do you prefer? 

I would much rather have a computer than a console because I can search the web, pirate games, map, like the interface (mouse and keyboard) better than console&#39;s, and more.</description>

c) No. World of Goo is only $20, but it’s been pirated to a disgusting amount since it has no DRM. Same with Zeno Clash. Yes, they won’t even give newer and smaller developers any mercy.</p>
<p>I think you’ll find that Zeno Clash was pirated by its own company. They release several Copies of their game on torrent sites. So far as I know, they are doing fine because of this, people have respect for this sort of thing. I would give you an example of these torrents, but we’re not allowed to post them.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is why if you like the game, you can always go to the store, support the developers, and buy the game even though you have the game pirated. Sounds perfectly logic to me.</p>

<p>A more realistic DRM plan would be a combination of the standard CD-Key, activation from services such as Steam or (in Rockstar’s case) Rockstar Games’ Social Club, and DNA testing. Again, all could of been avoided if people had respect for the developers and publishers.</p>

            <p>I would prefer consoles if they had keyboards and mouses (Seriously, why didn’t anyone think of this?). Yes they would look a lot like PC’s but consoles only run Games on their system, instead of running OS, like on a PC, and bunch of other programs in the background which makes any program in the foreground a little less fast.</p>

            <p>I don’t like games where you need a CD in the drive, which is why I like steam. I buy most of my games off there (aside from GTA 4, because I didn’t want to download 14 GB).<br>
I pirate stuff, but I also buy stuff as well to support developers. I buy games, music, movies, etc, but I also pirate a bunch. Sure it’s not the same as buying everything, but it’s better then some of you assholes who pirate everything just because they can.</p>

<p>Get the fuck out!<br>
Look, I find the XBox controller bearable, but really? After a few hours of PC gaming for the first time, I couldn’t even LOOK at a controller!<br>
I’m used to it now though, so I can still own you all in Halo 3 (yes, all five of the members in this PC gaming focused fourm that like Halo 3!)</p>

            <p>I prefer console gaming because I prefer the xbox controller to any interface on earth.  Also I like the equalizing effect of consoles.  No douche is going to do better because of his equipment.</p>
<p>Also you can pirate games on consoles too.  However, I’m against pirating and you should all burn in hell.</p>

 Brother Shrike:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>best DRM there is:<br>
a) don’t release crappy games and expect people to buy it<br>
b) release a demo so people can try it without buying<br>
c) don’t charge a crapload for the game. Also DLC is a good incentive if you make a system where it can’t just be pirated as well.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>a.) You’re assuming that pirates have respect for developers and publishers. They don’t.<br>
b.) Yes. Every game needs a demo.<br>
c) No. World of Goo is only $20, but it’s been pirated to a disgusting amount since it has no DRM. Same with Zeno Clash. Yes, they won’t even give newer and smaller developers any mercy.</p>
<p>A more realistic DRM plan would be a combination of the standard CD-Key, activation from services such as Steam or (in Rockstar’s case) Rockstar Games’ Social Club, and DNA testing. Again, all could of been avoided if people had respect for the developers and publishers.</p>
