    <title>Censorship</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/censorship/2592</link>
    <description>So.  There&#39;s been something on my mind for a long time that I&#39;ve never had a chance to really hash over.  And that&#39;s censorship.

I guess it started for me when I was watching &quot;Back to School&quot; on television a long time ago.  I know the movie by heart (it&#39;s one of my top favorite films).  So, I was just waiting for the scene with Rodney Dangerfield in Sam Kinison&#39;s &quot;Contemporary American History&quot; class, which Kinison&#39;s character used as a bully pulpit to espouse anti-anti-war hatred and diatribes.  It&#39;s an awesome scene.  If you haven&#39;t seen the movie, I suggest you do so. It&#39;s a bit dated now, but it still works.

So, anyway, in that scene, Kinison&#39;s character asks the &quot;not a fighter&quot; Dangerfield why, in the Korean Conflict, that &quot;we failed to achieve victory&quot;.  [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfi4s8cjLFI&#39;]Here&#39;s the scene[/url] (warning: offensive text follows)

Kinison: &quot;You remember that thing we had about 30 years ago called that Korean conflict? Yeah, and how we failed to achieve victory? How come we didn&#39;t cross the 38th parallel and push those rice-eaters back to the Great Wall of China? Then take it apart BRICK BY BRICK AND NUKE THEM BACK INTO THE FUCKING STONE AGE FOREVER?!  HOW COME?!  TELL ME WHY?!    SAY IT!!!  SAY IIIITTTT!!!!!&quot;
Dangerfield: &quot;...all right, I&#39;ll say it!  Cause Truman was too much of a pussy wimp to let MacArthur go in there AND BLOW OUT THOSE COMMIE BASTARDS!&quot;

So, like I said, I was watching it on television one day, and Dangerfield&#39;s &quot;censored&quot; line came across as this:

&quot;Cause Truman was too much of a P-wimp to let MacArthur go in there and BLOW OUT THOSE COMMIE PIPSQUEAKS!&quot;

O_o

So, that began my hatred for censorship.  I would like to hear y&#39;all&#39;s opinion on it.</description>

<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Die Gedanken sind frei,<br>
Wer kann sie erraten,<br>
Sie fliehen vorbei,<br>
Wie naechtliche Schatten.<br>
Kein Mensch kann sie wissen,<br>
Kein Jaeger erschiessen<br>
Mit Pulver und Blei. (alternative: es bleibet dabei)<br>
Die Gedanken sind frei!</p>
<p>Ich denke was ich will<br>
Und was mich begluecket,<br>
Doch alles in der Still’,<br>
Und wie es sich schicket.<br>
Mein Wunsch, mein Begehren<br>
Kann niemand verwehren,<br>
Es bleibet dabei:<br>
Die Gedanken sind frei!</p>
<p>Und sperrt man mich ein<br>
In finsteren Kerker,<br>
Ich spotte der Pein<br>
Und menschlicher Werke. (alternative: das alles sind rein / vergebliche werke)<br>
Denn meine Gedanken<br>
Zerreissen die Schranken<br>
Und Mauern entzwei,<br>
Die Gedanken sind frei!</p>
<p>Drum will ich auf immer<br>
Den Sorgen entsagen<br>
Und will dich auch nimmer<br>
Mit Willen verklagen. (alt.: Mit Grillen mehr plagen. Grillen = nonsense)<br>
Man kann ja im Herzen<br>
Stets lachen und scherzen<br>
Und denken dabei:<br>
Die Gedanken sind frei!</p>
<p>Thoughts are free<br>
who could guess what they might be?<br>
They fly by as shadows in the night.<br>
No human can know them,<br>
no hunter could kill them<br>
with his powder and lead;<br>
The truth is that<br>
thoughts are free.</p>
<p>I think what I will,<br>
of what gives me happiness<br>
quietly within my rightful silence.<br>
There can never be anyone<br>
who could argue with my wishes<br>
and my desires -<br>
it will always be true<br>
that thoughts are free.</p>
<p>And if someone locks me up<br>
in the dark dungeons,<br>
their acts are in vain,<br>
because my thoughts<br>
tear down the barriers<br>
and the stone walls – they are free.</p>
<p>That is why I will<br>
abstain from sorrows<br>
and will no longer harm myself with misery,<br>
for in your heart you can always laugh<br>
and as you do, you can think:<br>
thoughts are free.</p>
<p>This is the English version that was popularized by Pete Seeger and was song as a leftist protest song during the McCarthy era:</p>
<p>Die Gedanken sind frei<br>
My thoughts freely flower,<br>
Die Gedanken sind frei<br>
My thoughts give me power.<br>
No scholar can map them,<br>
No hunter can trap them,<br>
No man can deny:<br>
Die Gedanken sind frei!</p>
<p>I think as I please<br>
And this gives me pleasure,<br>
My conscience decrees,<br>
This right I must treasure;<br>
My thoughts will not cater<br>
To duke or dictator,<br>
No man can deny–<br>
Die Gedanken sind frei!</p>
<p>And if tyrants take me<br>
And throw me in prison<br>
My thoughts will burst free,<br>
Like blossoms in season.<br>
Foundations will crumble,<br>
The structure will tumble,<br>
And free men will cry:<br>
Die Gedanken sind frei!</p>
<p>Neither trouble or pain<br>
Will ever touch me again.<br>
No good comes of fretting,<br>
My hope’s in forgetting.<br>
Within myself still<br>
I can think as I will,<br>
But I laugh, do not cry:<br>
Die Gedanken sind frei!</p>
<p>Je pense ce que je veux,<br>
elles sont libres, les penses,<br>
et ce qui rend heureux.<br>
Personne ne peut les arrter.<br>
Je le fais en silence,<br>
mes penses peuvent s’envoler<br>
ma convenance<br>
comme une ombre dans l’obscurit.</p>
<p>Mon dsir, ma volont,<br>
aucun homme ne peut les deviner.<br>
Personne ne peut les refuser,<br>
aucun chasseur les tuer<br>
C’est ma ralit<br>
Aucun fusil assassiner<br>
la libert de penser,<br>
la libert de penser.</p>
<p>Et si l’on me jette<br>
dans un cachot profond,<br>
toujours il me reste<br>
ma vrit au fond.<br>
Aucun mur ne peut lui rsister:<br>
libert de penser.<br>
Aucune frontire l’arrter:<br>
“die Gedanken sind frei”<br>
c’est ma ralit.<br>
Libert de penser,<br>
la libert de penser.<br>
La libert de penser,<br>
die Gedanken sind frei.</p>

            <p>I despise censorship. The censorship on television is sort of okay with me though but danielangeo’s idea about 2 streams, one uncut and one cut, is pretty good. I think they should do the same thing with foreign movies, one stream in the original language with subs and the other with the dub. I hated having to watch Kung Fu Hustle on TV with the dub, but that’s sort of a different story.</p>
<p>I actually did a report on censorship last year and while looking for info found a website where they rent movies but all the movies are censored. Pretty stupid. There was also some people that wanted to have censored DVDs available in stores to buy.</p>
<p>Movies and the like are one thing but art censorship is totally ridiculous. That story about the ribbons over the pictures at the amusement park just boils my blood. Also, schools not being able to take kids to museums of art because parents complained about the nudity bugs me as well.</p>
<p>It’s like they think it’ll cause their kids to go crazy or something if they see the human body or violence. It just ruins the creativity of the original artist.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that it should all depend on if the user has a choice or not. With nearly everything that is censored - from TV to movies to statues at the fair - a person could choose to have seen the thing or not.<br>
Only in a situation where a person has no choice but to see something should censorship even apply. For example: if a person decides that he wants to create “art” by painting a large, naked person above a highway tunnel (which apparently actually happened somewhere)…well that’s a tough example because it begs the question, should the naked body be censored.<br>
Okay, a large naked women being screwed vaginally, while having her throat cut. I think we can all agree that that’s offensive. Considering that drivers will all see this art, won’t have much of a choice but to do so, in this case it probably should be censored.<br>
But you’d be hard-pressed to find a real-world case where censorship would be permissible. In nearly every situation, it isn’t.</p>

            <p>i think swearing on tv and film shouldnt be censored if its histroically accurate and/or relevevant to the mood of the scene. Like in school when I was 14 our drama teacher allowed us to use this when we did a scene similar to that of the diner robbery in pulp fiction</p>

<p>anyway censorship forever annoys me,  especially game censorship, if I can go into a store and buy some porn, why can’t I go in a store and buy a game where I strangle people and bash there heads into toilets on my wii? It’s shame on the parents for not looking at the age certficate if there kids are playing it, you wouldnt give your kid some porn would you? And its also up to stores to ask me for ID if I want to buy an adult game, because yes there are adult gamers around now adays. And movie censorship annoys me, it’s a film, I’m eighteen let me watchthat guy rip that guys face off with acid, while that bitch throws a pickaxe into a baby goats head, a) its not real and b) the special effects are awesome! So leave it alone and leave it in my local cinema!</p>

<p>I don’t really believe that, if you’re the owner of said work, that it should be censored in any way.  I bought Back to School on DVD and it has “pussies like you” in all its glory.  And that is as it should be.</p>
<p>However, for the more uncontrollable aspects, such as when a movie is shown on broadcast TV, I think that there should be a choice offered.  I think two concurrent broadcast streams should be sent–one censored (for those that get hot and bothered by a nipple) and one uncensored and you get to pick and choose which is shown.  I’m sure we have the technology to do so.</p>
<p>I think my anti-censorship stance culminated when I was at an amusement park.  There was a <a href="https://www.joyrides.com/pne_playland/photos/wave_swinger.jpg" data-bbcode="true">swinger ride</a>.  Along the trunk of the ride was faux Greco-Roman art of gods and goddesses (a la “The Sistine Chapel”).  Like the Sistine Chapel paintings, some of them were nude.</p>
<p>Evidently, someone complained because, the next time I was there, the “naughty bits” were covered up by strategically placed ribbons.  That made me want to <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/rage.png?v=9" title=":rage:" class="emoji" alt=":rage:">.</p>
<p>I understand the desire to shield your children from things you deem morally incorrect, but does that mean that YOUR desire is allowed to supersede ours?  Should I have to hear Rodney Dangerfield complain about “commie pipsqueaks” because you don’t like “commie bastards”?</p>
<p>Are you going to put pants on David?</p>

<p>Not really.  That thread is about free speech in general.  Mine is about censorship in works of art such as movies, books, and the like.  Specifically, the eradication of certain portion of the work because it’s deemed “offensive” by a group.  This could mean the “commie bastards” line from Back to School, or it could mean wanting to put a pair of shorts on Michelangelo’s David.</p>

            <p>I think that an outright ban of a product or media is fundamentally wrong and a limit to free speech in most circumstances, but I can understand regulating daytime television for the benefit of parents who want to be able to watch children with their child and the like.</p>

            <p>So.  There’s been something on my mind for a long time that I’ve never had a chance to really hash over.  And that’s censorship.</p>
<p>I guess it started for me when I was watching “Back to School” on television a long time ago.  I know the movie by heart (it’s one of my top favorite films).  So, I was just waiting for the scene with Rodney Dangerfield in Sam Kinison’s “Contemporary American History” class, which Kinison’s character used as a bully pulpit to espouse anti-anti-war hatred and diatribes.  It’s an awesome scene.  If you haven’t seen the movie, I suggest you do so. It’s a bit dated now, but it still works.</p>
<p>So, anyway, in that scene, Kinison’s character asks the “not a fighter” Dangerfield why, in the Korean Conflict, that “we failed to achieve victory”.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfi4s8cjLFI" data-bbcode="true">Here’s the scene</a> (warning: offensive text follows)</p>
<p>Kinison: “You remember that thing we had about 30 years ago called that Korean conflict? Yeah, and how we failed to achieve victory? How come we didn’t cross the 38th parallel and push those rice-eaters back to the Great Wall of China? Then take it apart BRICK BY BRICK AND NUKE THEM BACK INTO THE FUCKING STONE AGE FOREVER?!  HOW COME?!  TELL ME WHY?!    SAY IT!!!  SAY IIIITTTT!!!”<br>
Dangerfield: “…all right, I’ll say it!  Cause Truman was too much of a pussy wimp to let MacArthur go in there AND BLOW OUT THOSE COMMIE BASTARDS!”</p>
<p>So, like I said, I was watching it on television one day, and Dangerfield’s “censored” line came across as this:</p>
<p>“Cause Truman was too much of a P-wimp to let MacArthur go in there and BLOW OUT THOSE COMMIE PIPSQUEAKS!”</p>
<p>O_o</p>
<p>So, that began my hatred for censorship.  I would like to hear y’all’s opinion on it.</p>
