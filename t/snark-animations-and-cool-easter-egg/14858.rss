    <title>Snark Animations and Cool Easter Egg</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/snark-animations-and-cool-easter-egg/14858</link>
    <description>Just something I found while playing some Black Mesa. This made snarks even cuter for me, and I literally started laughing when I saw the 2nd idle animation (IT&#39;S SO GOOD.)
As for the sound effects for the idle animations, I made them myself (the snark squeaking) because unfortunately both idle animations don&#39;t have sound effects in-game...

Probably the most pointless video I&#39;ve ever uploaded but I felt like this was worth sharing. IT&#39;S JUST TOO GOOD.</description>
