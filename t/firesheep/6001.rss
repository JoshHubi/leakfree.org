I just stumbled upon this while messing around on youtube instead of studying for finals.  This add-on for firefox called firesheep allows you to access web pages being viewed by other users on unsecured wifi networks.  Apparently it intercepts unencrypted cookies travelling through the router and copies them to your computer.  It gives you the ability to mess with people&#39;s accounts on facebook, youtube, etc.  Mozilla has also stated that it won&#39;t blacklist it.  So unless you&#39;re running a proxy or a vpn, anyone at starbucks can not only see what you&#39;re doing but also hijack your accounts.  This is some disturbing stuff.</description>

<p>Luckily we run all of our wifi through a vpn at Penn State, so I’m covered on campus.  The guy that created this claims that he made it to expose flaws in the design of the internet.  He succeeded but somehow I don’t completely buy that’s all he was doing.</p>
