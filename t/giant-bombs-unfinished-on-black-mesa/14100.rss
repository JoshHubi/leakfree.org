            <p>It’s a personality driven video game website formed by several ex-Gamespot (not Gamestop) members after one of them was fired for doing a scathing review of a game that was heavily advertised on the website.  They caught the early wave of video-focused content while at Gamespot and went whole-hog on it when the struck out on their own.  Their probably best known for their weekly podcast, the Giant Bombcast, thier Quick Look videos that show off around an hour (give or take, depending on the game) of recent or upcoming releases, their E3 and GDC coverage where they assemble large panels of industry alumni to chat about stuff, and thier lengthy game of the year content where they record their entire selection process, often totaling like 5-10 hours of audio content.</p>
<p>They also have premium content for subscribers that includes a end-of-the-week livestream where they play random games, longform game playthroughs, and just other random nonsense like this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkL9SP3HJZE" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=KkL9SP3HJZE</a></p>
<p>The site was really cooking back in its heyday, but after losing a couple of its members over time, its not quite as great as it once was.  Still worth checking out though.</p>

            <p>I’m impressed they could keep the charade going for over 18 minutes.  ^^</p>

            <p>This video bothered me quite a bit.</p>
<p>They never notice how obvious a System Shock 2 ripoff this Black Mesa game is.</p>
<p>I expected better from Dan…</p>
