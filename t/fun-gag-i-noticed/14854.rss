    <title>Fun gag I noticed</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fun-gag-i-noticed/14854</link>
    <description>This might have been pointed out before, but during Unforeseen Consequences there&#39;s a scientist hiding in a bin.

When you go up to him, this sequence starts:
&quot;Gordon? Is that you? Is it saf-ARGH!&quot;
*headcrab attacks*
&quot;Oh dear, I appear to have soiled myself.&quot;

You can kill him with a grenade or a gun if you like, but interestingly if you kill the headcrab with a grenade without killing the scientist, he completes the first line of dialogue and then nothing else happens.

Just thought it was a cool little detail, if intentional. :thumbsup:</description>

<p>But… How would it not be intentional?</p>
