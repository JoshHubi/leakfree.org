    <title>Surface Tension Uncut and Cascade Shadow Maps!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/surface-tension-uncut-and-cascade-shadow-maps/14749</link>
    <description>[u][b]Coming Soon![/b][/u][/size]

Here’s a quick glimpse of what we are polishing for our next update. You’ve hopefully already seen our preview of Surface Tension: Uncut over at [url=&#39;https://lambdageneration.com/discussion/half-life/interview-with-black-mesa-developer-chon-kemp-exclusive-look-at-surface-tension-uncut-info-on-xen-livestream-giveaway/&#39;]Lambda Generation[/url]. We are very excited to see how the community likes the uncut levels. We’ve done a ton of work since we’ve shown those screen shots, and even improved our AI for the Alien Grunts and Vortigaunts to help make this chapter be as fun and engaging as possible.

Our BIG announcement though, is that we have implemented Cascaded Shadow Mapping, or CSM into the Black Mesa Engine. CSM brings the visual quality of the game to a whole new level. It’s hard to describe in words what CSM does to the game, so we’ve added a few screenshots below to give you a better idea. Notice the crisp shadows on the world and weapons, that originally weren’t there.

New Shadows work on viewmodels too!

They work in real-time, they are not prebaked!

[b][u]Why work on this?[/b][/u][/size]

First, there were a lot of community members asking for this addition. One of our developers, Chon Kemp, added these levels into the mod version of the game, and people wanted to see it in the official version. To show we hear what the community is asking for, and as a small thanks for the people who have already bought the game we completely rebuilt the last three maps of Surface Tension based off of Half-Life (side note you can play Chon’s On A Rail: Uncut on the workshop).

Second, Surface Tension did not feel complete without its later levels. The end of ST is the part where the H.E.C.U start to lose, and it sets up the events for Half-Life 2. It’s a very important part of the Half-Life story.

Third, CSM was an absolute must for us to reach our vision for bringing Xen to life. We&#39;ve brought CSM to you in this update as a little tiny taste of what is to come. We hope this excites you as much as it excites our team! Surface Tension: UNCUT was the perfect opportunity for us to test CSM and get it functioning on our already completed earthbound levels, as well as a number of other techniques to be used in completing Xen.

[u][b]When with this be released?[/b][/u][/size]

You can expect the Surface Tension Update to launch later this month.

Developer TextFAMGUY1 (Chon Kemp) is also writing a dev blog about the development and the story behind Surface Tension: Uncut. Expect to see that quite soon, keep checking back for more!</description>

<p>It reminds me about the scene where you can go to the gates instead of bombardment panel in the final Surface Tension map and Gargantua instead of killing you will open them but sadly right after that he will try to kill you anyway.It would be nice to see some peaceful solutions instead of mindless butchery because even Gargantua has his own life and I would like to save him.</p>

            <p>I’m not entirely sure whether someone already mentioned this or not, but whatever:<br>
You can actually kill the agrunt right after it teleports into the security room with a perfect headshot using the shotgun’s alt fire. (But I’m guessing a charged tau cannon should get the job done as well)<br>
Unfortunately, the security guard doesn’t acknowledge that you just saved his ass (what a jerk) and just stands there looking at you in idle state. It’s obviously not meant to happen, so you guys may wanna look into that.<br>
Personally, I would find it pretty cool if saving him was an actual option (the guard is really badass and definitely one of my favourite characters). But just making the agrunt invincible should work as well I suppose…</p>

            <p>The guard and the A-grunt scene is epic, even if the guard loses.</p>
<p>I mean really , that guard acts like a total coward during the escort part, though he has more personality then any other minor guard in the game. then when it comes time for him to die, he takes more hits then even the soldiers can take, seeing how an A-grunt can throw a soldier through a cement wall that guard really took a beating and lasted longer then a soldier.</p>
<p>Rest in peaces, un named guard, may your epic death live on forever.</p>

            <p>Well, the Garg would have to destroy the security hut in order to get to him, though, which would buy him some time (that’s what I thought all the crashing noises were, btw.)</p>

            <p>The garg sounds giant and monstrous, the agrunt sounds more angry. I think you could hear it teleport in. I don’t think the guard would last 3 seconds that close to a garg.</p>

            <p>Wait, that was just an Agrunt? I thought it was the Garg that killed him.</p>
<p>(Actually, since you guys foreshadow the bejeezus out of that Garg throughout those last few maps in a really kind of awesome way, I’d really kind of like it to be the Garg that kills him.)</p>

            <p>Yeah we tried to design the sniper scene to account for many playstyles. There isn’t really a “right” way.</p>

<p>[sup]Cheers. That Guard is actually probably my favourite part of STU. He’s got a tonne of personality and really switches up the pacing of the chapter in a great way. I was so thrilled with how well he turned out. Particularly as he was so dull in the original HL1 maps. [/sup]</p>
<p>[sup][/sup]<br>
[sup]And yeah, he’s a tough bastard. Did you hear how many hits he took from that Agrunt before he finally went down!? A lot!<br>

<p>The snipers know that Gordon Freeman is the real threat. Now if the zombies had RPGs this scene might have played out differently.</p>
<p>Sorry, I’m not here to complain, nitpick or question every move and design point the developers make.</p>

<p>You can’t break the windows because we want you to have the sniper scene. The windows have physics/collisions, they just are overridden/ controlled by the level designer.</p>

<p>Well i found it really easy to get to the metal hatch on the roof without going through the doors on the left.<br>
In fact, when i went to play again, this time for some ARG seeking, i only then realized that i was suppose to<br>
go through the doors.</p>
<p>The problem is that while the hatch is opening, you get cover from it, and the zombies don’t get to you in time<br>
to push you from the hatch.</p>
<p>And what about snipers not shooting the zombies?</p>
