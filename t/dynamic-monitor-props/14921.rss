    <title>Dynamic Monitor Props</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dynamic-monitor-props/14921</link>
    <description>Hey! It&#39;s me, again. I know i&#39;m gonna ask too much things since i&#39;m learner. Sorry about that, i&#39;m asking what i cannot find by googling hard.

I want some working PC Monitor Props in my map, but not like cameras to monitor some part of map. I want them to play some random videos like scripted SFM scenes and/or some gif screensavers i created.

Don&#39;t know about gif&#39;s and videos but i think using a tiny decal on a monitor will do the static vision thing. Not sure if there&#39;s a better way to do it.

Thanks, peace ^^</description>

            <p>There’s really two ways to do this- one is with animated textures, which can be created using <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VTFEdit" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">VTFEdit</a>, the other is by setting up a “play” of what you want to display in some box outside of the explorable section of your map and using cameras to display it.</p>

            <p>maybe you could make an ani9mated texture/decal of the video “a short sequence” and then either make it a custom teure to replace one of the monitors textures or put a thin brush just infront of the monitor with the texture on that ,<a href="https://www.moddb.com/games/half-life-2/tutorials/how-to-create-an-animated-texture" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moddb.com/games/half-life-2/tutorials/how-to-create-an-animated-texture</a> a little info on how to do it</p>
