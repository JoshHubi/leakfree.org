    <title>The Steam servers are currently too busy</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-steam-servers-are-currently-too-busy/9635</link>
    <description>Has I have a really slow internet, I put the game in a external HDD from a friends computer. I have done this previously with steam games without any problem. For this one I copied all the source related files from steamapps and the black mesa instaler.

Arriving home I&#39;ve already tried lots of different solutions, but my game doesnt open, always saying &quot;The Steam servers are currently too busy to handle your request, Please try again in a few minutes&quot;. 

Normaly this error is related or with steam files corruption or with the download server. I&#39;ve already changed the server and reinstaled  Steam (keeping only steamapps) and the problem keeps happeing. I&#39;ve also already tried manualy deleting BMS and reinstaling, and none of these things worked.

Is there anything I can do to play the game? Thanks for the help.</description>

            <p>Actually, issue seems to be resolved! (Not a minute after I posted I was trying things!)</p>
<p>The error appears to be coming from Source SDK 2007.</p>
<p>I deleted the local content for Source SDK 2007, and 2006. Then, just reinstalled Source SDK 2007.</p>
<p>Black Mesa launched just fine after that.</p>
<p>You can also try just verifying cache files for SDK 2007, but a removal/reinstall DOES resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>I’m having this issue too. I’ve been playing around with it, switching servers, deleting various files etc with no luck. I am using wine, but its nice to know I’m not the only one. Anyone else experiencing issues?</p>
