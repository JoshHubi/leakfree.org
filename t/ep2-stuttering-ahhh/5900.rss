    <title>Ep2 stuttering ahhh!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ep2-stuttering-ahhh/5900</link>
    <description>I&#39;m getting dreadful stuttering in Episode 2 and I can&#39;t figure out why. What&#39;s changed is that I got a new hard drive (bigger and faster) and I did a clean vista install and redownloaded my steam games. HL2 and Ep1 load a lot faster now (wich iz nise :3) and run as well as they ever did on my craptop. 

Ep2, on the other hand, is unplayable even with my low expectations. It starts with a framerate of about half of what I used to get then drops to 0.5fps until I move my mouse down to look at the ground. I can move along and shoot things fine... I just can&#39;t look up while I&#39;m doing it.

I&#39;ve got the appropriate graphics drivers off the Acer website. I don&#39;t know if those are the best for me to use. I have defragmented from inside steam and I have defragmented and optimized my whole disk.

I can&#39;t think what else to try to get ep2 back to the framerates I used to get...
Any halp plx?

(P.S. My computer has intel integrated Gs and is three years old. I know a lot of people will want to post &quot;get a better computer&quot;. Do that, if you want to, but I will ignore you because I can&#39;t get anything better. I know it is capable of running ep2 well enough to enjoy the experience.)</description>

            <p>Older engines used to use a technique called Z-buffering/culling, where it would partially or completely leave objects unrendered if the player couldn’t see them.</p>

<p>Thanks. That’s an interesting articlet although I don’t totally get it. I had figured that the engine wouldn’t spend any calculations on something when Gordon’s not looking at it. I’ll fiddle with the commands and see what happens.</p>

            <p>I would advise getting Win 7 as well, regardless of the source you use.</p>
<p>But outside of that, you should make sure that Vista is completely up-to-date. That does fix a large amount of the problems it has.</p>
<p>Yeah, and beyond recommending that you get a better computer, you should built your computer yourself rather than getting a prebuilt one. Elsewise you can’t modify it, or update it in any way.</p>

            <p>I have a 2Ghz Dual Core from intel and 2GB of mamory. I can’t remember anything else.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t mind <span class="bbcode-i">using</span> win7 but I’m hesitant to <span class="bbcode-i">pay</span> for it. I know what the solution for that is but I don’t want to get caught out by ms.</p>
<p>I was surprised how well source games ran on my system, even on vista. I can’t see how win7 can significantly improve on that.</p>

            <p>post specs here and then upgrade to windows7. (i was an xp user, now im never gonna go back)</p>
<p>also i remember the fresh format stutter, urgh i forget how i got rid of it. Regardless, I had a similar problem except for me it was with cs;s and it felt like i was running too fast and then it would slingshot me back a few steps.</p>
<p>Either way, post ya specs here</p>
