    <description>I remember walking around my university campus that is quite large and seeing that it had a centralized HVAC system with huge cooling towers that has water running over huge radiators. I imagine that black mesa uses the same kind of huge HVAC system to supply the whole complex and keep it at that pleasant 67 deg  :stuck_out_tongue:  Maybe if there is room on one of the outside levels a model can be added in the distance or close by to reflect this massive HVAC system.

I always find it fun to muse about the possible inner workings of such an amazing complex. Imagine all the work it takes to upkeep that facility and to keep track of all the ongoings. I imagine it would be fun.</description>

            <p>All of the computers and other sensitive devices in Black Mesa would require them to make sure things like wet bulb temperatures and humidity levels were kept strictly controlled as well.  Not to mention the heat generated by all that equipment.  In any facility bigger than a house, more factors than just human comfort are major considerations.</p>
<p>I suspect that Black Mesa would run almost as many air changes as your average hospital, considering what they’re doing in there.  Which means they’re sucking in up to 100% outside air and not recirculating a lot of return air.  And since this is New Mexico, that air is hot and dry, requiring both humidification and cooling.</p>

<p>Know any buildings with big entrance areas, usually open to a few floors? They use this, it’s called atrium cooling. A building management system will monitor temperatures and open high windows to vent heat. Works well and saves a ton of energy</p>

</aside>
<p>You have to circulate air to keep it fresh. A modern building may use atmospheric sensors, and there will be a clean air and dirty air system kept separate. Dirty air is vented, while clean air is cooled and treated to prevent bacteria build up before being circulated.</p>

<p>centralized HVAC system with huge cooling towers that has water running over huge radiators.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Your campus is cooled with a chilled-water system.  Somewhere inside your building there are <a href="https://www.carrieraircon.com.au/upload/data/Products-%20Commercial/23XRV-1.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">chillers</a> running to cool the water that is circulated through the buildings.</p>
<p>Those towers you see are cooling the condenser water.  They don’t actually contain the chilled water (or glycol solution) that is circulated through the building.  It’s the water that carries the heat away from the condenser side of the chiller and out of the building.  The water that goes to the building’s cooling coils is circulated through the evaporator side of the chiller.</p>
<p>And trust me, it’s far from ‘centralized’.  There are lines and coils and airhandlers and dampers and probably VAV boxes or mixers (and ducting) ALL OVER your school’s buildings.  Not to mention the DDC or pneumatic control systems and their related parts.</p>
<p>And yeah, Black Mesa’s HVAC system is completely impossible and generally ridiculous.  If Gordon really had to depend on traveling through the HVAC system in a place like that, he’d have been stuck and dead before ever leaving Anomalous Materials.  It’s almost as if the building’s climate control system was designed specifically for a player-controlled character to pass through…</p>

            <p>I’m a civil engineering student, so I’ve been around a plant room for a new building we have on campus.</p>
<p>For one modern building with a high energy efficiency rating and a building management system, the entire top floor, the roof and the basement are taken up with plant equipment. This includes air circulation and cleansing, boilers, electricity input, emergency generators for file servers, boilers, rainwater recycling system, water supply tanks and some other gubbins.</p>
<p>It was very interesting, especially the scale of the stuff needed. For any mappers I have photos of all this gear, most maps tend to just have a few ducts and a big nondescript metal box if they have a plant room. The reality is much more complex</p>

            <p>hi and welcome to the forums<br>
“muse about the possible inner workings of such an amazing complex”<br>
yes, that made my <em>whoa</em> experience while inbound, when i was younger,<br>
to speculate about locations and mechanical stuff.<br>
now i know that  there is nothing behind mystic blast doors and huge machines.<br>
pure facade and the disappointment after my first noclip run back then …<br>
its still a good idea… facade or not, things like your idea that look awesome enhance the game<br>
even though i think that the devs have taken care of the “looking awesome” very well  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
