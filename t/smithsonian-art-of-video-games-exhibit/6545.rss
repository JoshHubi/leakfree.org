    <description>The Smithsonian American Art Museum will be hosting an Art of Video Games Exhibit from March 16th to September 30th, and is asking gamers to vote for their favorite games which will be displayed at the exhibit.
[quote]
The Art of Video Games exhibition will explore the 40-year evolution of video games as an artistic medium, with a focus on striking visual effects, the creative use of new technologies, and the most influential artists and designers. We want you to help us select the eighty video games that will be represented in the exhibition. Remember, this is an art exhibition, so be sure to vote for games that you think are visually spectacular or boast innovative design!
[/quote]
The categories are split into eras, which are split into gaming platforms that each have 16 to choose from. You should all go and vote! Should be interesting to see the results.

Voting takes place at [url]https://www.artofvideogames.org/[/url]</description>

<p>I bet Blizzard would be willing to give away the server software for something like this.  Maybe even send a tech to DC to set it up and monitor it until it’s taken down.  They would also probably have it set up like one of their test servers usually are, you make a character, and they’re max level with a bunch of good items.</p>

            <p>I voted for one game, because I wouldn’t let myself vote on games I hadn’t played.</p>

<p>I’m really sorry. I know there is nothing more obnoxious than “u mad?” but it fit so perfectly I had to use it. Generally I avoid posting 4chanian stupidity as much as possible. And you’re wrong; it was never just the newbies, it started with the regulars and then made its way down the ranks.</p>

<p>u mad? So you are saying a game is beautiful because actions that exist for only a split second are really good? That’s a pretty minor detail. It’s kind of like saying a fat chick is hot because she has a big boobs; you gotta look at the big picture.</p>
