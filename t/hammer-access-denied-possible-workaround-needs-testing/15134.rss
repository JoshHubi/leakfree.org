    <title>Hammer Access Denied, possible workaround, needs testing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hammer-access-denied-possible-workaround-needs-testing/15134</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using Windows 10.

So I&#39;ve mapped now for about 30 minutes and hammer still haven&#39;t crashed, when it occurred to me that I didn&#39;t have steam running..
So it seems that if you don&#39;t have steam on, hammer won&#39;t crash.

So.. To map without crashes:
Start steam, start black mesa.
Start black mesa hammer, use ctrl + alt + delete, kill steam but leave bms.exe and hammer.exe running

For someone who has 103 access denied crash reports from 2016, this is a pretty big deal.</description>
