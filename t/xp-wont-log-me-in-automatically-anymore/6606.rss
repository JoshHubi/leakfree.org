    <title>XP won&#39;t log me in automatically anymore.</title>

    <description>Just starting today, XP (Pro) has been prompting me to pick my username (KawaiTei) on starup. it&#39;s NEVER had to ask me before as i&#39;ve always been logged in automatically. i have no idea why it&#39;s suddenly asking me and i&#39;d like to know how to turn that crap off.

The only thing i recently installed was Crysis Wars and it installed a crapton of Gamespy BS and Securom garbage which i have since removed.

This has happened to me a LOOOOOOOONG time ago but i can&#39;t remember how to fix it. Likewise, i&#39;ve Googled the hell out of the problem but i can&#39;t seem to find a working query that shows helpful results.

<p>If you don’t have have a password you don’t NEED to this but tweakUI is a useful utility anyway (bigger thumbnails ftw).</p>

            <p>disable fast user switching and welcome screen (in control panel&gt;users&gt;change the way users log on etc) then download tweakUI (google powertoys for win xp) and in logon tab select autologon, don’t forget to type in your password, also you can copy your user settings (window color, mouse, wallpaper) to the login screen account for faster loading times</p>
