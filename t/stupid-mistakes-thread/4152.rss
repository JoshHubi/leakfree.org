    <description>We&#39;ve all had them! Share some stories that caused you grief or annoyance because you did something silly or stupid. I&#39;m sure that we&#39;ll get some good ones.

Last Friday, I was jumping hurdles in Phys. Ed., (I wasn&#39;t told to, just felt like showing off) and [b] EPICALLY [/b] failed.
The tip of my foot hit the hurdle, and I flipped over the top. My forearms hit the ground first and then I smashed my 
knees into the ground afterward. The metal on the hurdle bent and split, and the hurdle became unusable. They didn&#39;t
charge me for a new one because the Teacher was laughing so hard. I have to admit it would&#39;ve made an epic .gif

Let&#39;s see what you guys got!

EDIT: this is what happened...

<p>Sorry for laughing but, two hits of chemo and you’re tripping balls? You have to understand how your mentality works before attempting medical weed (or any other drug)… You see, everyone thinks they have a rock-solid mind until they try drugs.</p>
<p>Most drugs cause what I like to call “placebo effect enhancement” when everything you think of seems more likely to be real due to reality being slightly blurred (and you being stoned out of your fucking mind of course). Now I’ve never bad-tripped on weed, so I can’t say 100% it was your fault, but I tested my theory on someone who had a very similar experience to yours, the guy swore to never smoke again because every time he smoked things would go crazy (anxiety, depression, confusion and all kinds of stuff out of nowhere) so I just explained the placebo effect and that if he thought of relaxing and not about what happened last time nothing would happen, and right after he smoked we laughed nonstop for like an hour.</p>
<p>Now one thing I learned about the placebo effect is that it’s very hard to control, for example I took speed when everything in my life seemed okay, then it felt awesome and I started talking to random people (it’s one of the side effects) then I just didnt give a shit, then when the high was over the first thing that came to mind was, damn all that feeling good was just a delusion, I’m just a worthless piece of rotting flesh and I’m not getting anywhere, it was so easy to slip and then I badtripped like a mofo (I stayed in my room for 3 days), and ever since then I don’t take pills anymore. If your next time smoking weed is a bad experience even after reading this I suggest you stop smoking it, there is really no point to drugs but it’s part of my routine “nothing says relaxing like smoking a huge blunt”</p>
<p>Just remember, life is uncontrollable and ultimately pointless but that should calm you down not make you stress, there is no point to stress except making you forget things and sound like a bitch.</p>

<p>Well thanks, and actually I smoked it during the summer about a few weeks before school. Technically I only freaked out for 1-2 minutes but it lasted for what seemed to be eternity. Everything was good and I chalked it up to be a bad experience, and then came the second day of school. I was sitting in my basement with a few buddies of mine watching American Psycho, and for some reason I started feeling similar to the moment I had a bad trip and almost had a flashback. I started to panic, felt like I was on a rollercoaster watching myself fall, and it scared the living shit out of me. Like I said it’s been 2 years sense I had a very bad panic attack, (and oh there’s been worse than that, long story but it involved me walking around a town next to mine at night alone) and some part of me still wants to retry weed. Thanks for commenting though, very comforting to hear that.</p>

<p>My biggest mistake was (for the first time ever) smoking two huge billowy hits of medical marijuana. Oh and it was pretty much pure THC because it was keef. Needless to say I freaked out, had a nervous breakdown and practicably slipped into hell. Ever sense I have had anxiety, panic attacks, stress, etc, and this all happened two years ago. I’ve done other, stronger drugs but for some reason marijuana has really messed me up. Looking back on that day I wish I had never done it. However even if I do get a little anxious now and again things are starting to return back to normal for me mentally.</p>

            <p>On the subject of mistakes with computers I’ve fried 2 perfectly good laptops in the past, the first one was a dell core 2 duo with 2gb of ram, I killed it because I didn’t know what the charger plug polarity was, thought + was center and - was around it, turns out the center pin is a data line and the +/- are hidden so I had just killed the laptop’s ability to recognize a charger, but I blame it on DeLL, no other laptop manufacturer does this.</p>
<p>The 2nd one was an HP pavilion in which I had to flash the BIOS in order to switch the internal WiFi card because HP decided it was a good idea to hard code the DEV_ID’s of the old card to the BIOS so that when you try to put another card it goes “invalid wireless adapter remove illegal adapter and restart” so obviously I went and hex edited that shit just like google told me but I didn’t realize HP was the only laptop brand that can’t recover a failed BIOS flash, unless you buy a new motherboard. Fuck you HP.</p>

            <p>Excuse the necropost, but I have had yet again a stupid mistake. I uninstalled Steam in an attempt to fix a bug (which later turned out to be half life’s CDC thing). In the process, I deleted all  of my maps. I then attempted to restore them from an external hard drive thing. It failed and broke my computer. I had to do a Factory image reset and now all of my old cool programs are gone. I shall miss them.</p>

<p>The cheapest apartments around here a few years ago were $1000 a month, if you were lucky enough to snag them up before anyone else got to it. I only clear about $600 a month after all other necessities (taxes, food, car insurance, martial arts and gym fees).</p>

<p>D: :fffuuu:</p>
<p>I pay R$670 (~ $360) in my apartment, including water and external cleaning. Of course it is small (it’s a <span class="bbcode-i">kitnet</span>), but I only pay that much because it is a safe apartment (not so) near the second best university in Brazil (and best in Math ^_^). With $1000 ~ R$1860 a month (which is more than the scholarship I receive) I could probably rent an apartment for three in Rio  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Is that really that bad there? [*] It seems so normal to me people with more than 20 or even 30 years old living with their parents. You just move away when you get married, or if you need to study or work away from home, and, even then, you might want to spend weekends (or every other weekend) and vacations with your family. Well, that is how it is here in Brazil. Except for the people who don’t love their parents.</p>

<p>Hey, some people HAVE to have it worse than most others. Why not me? Better than some other unlucky guy, I guess. That’s what you get for being nice and decent in this world. I have made my choice a long time ago, and I chose the rocky path instead of the smooth road. Stupid choice, maybe. But I cannot go back. I dare not to.</p>

<p>I know what you mean. Sometimes it sucks hard to be the nice guy  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>EDIT<br>
[*] Nevermind, sorry. Just found your other post, where you say she was molested when she was a child.</p>

            <p>Two of my biggest mistakes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not pulling over and getting some sleep when driving home in the early morning after somewhat sobering up after a party.  I hit a telephone pole at 40+ mph when I fell asleep at the wheel.  Since I happened to have had alcohol in my system, I got a DUI on top of spending a day and a half in the hospital. I was a heavy drinker back then, so a BAC of 0.09 was nothing for me at the time, but still above the legal limit… so they had to charge me.</li>
<li>Going into business with my supposed best friend even though I knew he was a shyster.  Hey, a guy wouldn’t screw his best friend over, right?  Wrong.  This was years ago and I still owe over 20k to various governmental departments that the bankruptcy didn’t include.</li>
</ol>
<p>The eventual failure of the business played a part in my current divorce. She was adamantly against it (because she knew what kind of person “Mr. Shyster” was, too), yet I thought I could handle it and did it anyway.  I should have listened to her… not to say we still wouldn’t have eventually grown apart anyway, but at least there would have been a lot less stress and fighting over it.</p>

            <p>DansonDelta40:  I have to say that I am really impressed with your willingness to hang in there in order to save her the humiliation of having to go back to a bad situation. :wipes a tear and does a standing slow clap:</p>
<p>I will offer only one word of caution though…</p>
<p>While we all know women are created of soft warm fuzzies on a warm summer night and have a tendency to show compassion where none can be found, there are other times a woman will surprise you with the coldest shoulder to be found on this side of the sun while leaving you with nothing but a whimper and an empty wallet.</p>
<p>Please be smart and protect yourself with a plan b.  You will never know when you will need it.</p>
<p>Thee: Surely there is a compatible roommate to be had to share a 2 bedroom?  Unless you are an ax murderer that likes to bring victims home as dinner, anyone could make a go of a common space.  I suppose it could be difficult to FIND that perfect scenario and you would have to go through a lot of BS tho eh?</p>

<p>It’s practically HER apartment I am living in, where I moved in when I could no longer afford a flat in Hannover city. So telling her to gtfo is not exactly an option. Currently, we are both dependant on support money from the “Work Agency” and, since we are living together, get a lower share each than if we would live in separate apartments. If I would leave her, both our shares of support money would have to be recalculated, but chances are that she couldn’t afford to keep the flat and would have to move back to her family, whilst I could maybe find a flat that I could share with some students (preferrably, female ones, of course).</p>
<p>I just cannot bring myself to leave her in this miserable situation she would find herself in. Having to move back to her family - where all her childhood traumata originated? That would not only be egoistic. That would be EVIL. I can’t do that.</p>

<p>Yeah I already said IF you were the one paying the most. I would borrow you some money if it weren’t for the fact I have an own apartment and I barely get enough money to sustain me and my girl. Security guards just don’t get enough money for that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> . Not to mention I have to babysit my little brother every week and I basicly have to buy him food (the lil’ cunt only eats fries and junkfood) and toys, just to make him STFU.</p>
