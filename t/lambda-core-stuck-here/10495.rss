            <p>Well, I muddled through it anyway and didn’t come close to making the jump to end it.</p>
<p>No changes?  I guess I am getting too old for this shit.</p>

            <p>Your map probably glitched, the numbers remain.</p>
<p>Also, I think you just got better at crouch jumping and whatnot, there haven’t been any released updates to Black Mesa since its release. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I have gotten to the point where I need to work my way up the core by jumping from the rotating platforms into the core to get transported to the next level and I have run into a problem.  The three entrances per level are no longer numbered and I seem to have a talent for finding the ones that kill me.   Is my game glitched or were the numbers removed?</p>
<p>I have noticed that the developers have been updating the game since my last play through.  The crouch jumping is much better now, and either I’m getting too old for this or it is overall harder now as I seem to be using a lot more ammo than before.</p>

            <p>The engine read the command fine, it just didn’t find the specified map, which means it’s for some reason missing, or you’re doing something pretty wrong. Reboot the game, open the console, feed it the command <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">map bm_c3a2h</span></span>. There is no reason this shouldn’t work. If it doesn’t work, you somehow broke something (or at bad at using consoles), and the map is missing or corrupt. I’d reinstall, possibly tone back the attitude, maybe back up your saves and screenshots folder as well, if you’d like.</p>

<p>Not sure if you picked that up. The game couldn’t read that command. I don’t know if you made a typo or if you’re just screwing with me.</p>

<p>Got in a bit of a pickle here; I’m right at the Lambda Core where I’m trying to protect the scientist while he activates it. Anyways, the game autosaved about 4 seconds before the thing blows up or whatever. I can’t even enable godmode to get out of it and I’m too far from it to jump in (If that’s what I’m supposed to do).</p>

</aside>
<p>Our job is to protect the scientist allright. Once he says the portal is ready we should jump into it.  I think you might have wasted too much time if you have only 4 seconds before the portal blows up, and you can’t reach it even with the longjump module.  One option is to load an earlier save you made, or you can activate the console and reload this final map you are in.</p>

<p>Thanks, man! One question; What would the command be to do that?</p>

            <p>Well I stuck in the final scene in big chamber during the preparations for the beam to XEN. Well there just too much enemies. Is there trick? OK, Shooting them down. But with one shot three more appears. Thats demotivating… Because they shoot you down in no time! Even that scientist takes too much time for his preparations. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot! Merry Chrismas.</p>

            <p>You should go to the big glass casing first. The female scientist will give you the long jump module, and if you stand by the guard, he will open a room full of ammo.</p>

<p>How far back do I have to backtrack? Right after the scientist tells me I have open the pumps, I take the right bridge and get a loading message. After that I reach the area I’m currently in, which has two coolant tanks.<br>
If I take a left earlier, I can’t proceed any further because the ceiling has collapsed!</p>

            <p>Sooo, I’m at the teleport sequence where I’m being sent off to Xen. I’m not stuck, but I never enabled the second reactor core. I got the first one, and could figure out <span class="hashtag">#2</span> so I decided to try my luck at the aux thing. Next thing I know I’m being shipped off to Xen…</p>

            <p>Not really a sequel, per se, but the next release will be Xen with the G-Man ending.</p>

            <p>I turn all 4 and aux tank green, nothing more to do, I go to the scientist and he says “You still have to open the other tank!”. I’ve turned the switch for 02 and fought my way back against enemies to get this buggy message. I go back to coolant 02, open the grate again, it lifts me to the ledge with the batteries again. The door is now locked, so I can’t get to the zombies etc. That grate just won’t stay open.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because I gave up on coolant 02 and went to activate aux before discovering the ledge.</p>
<p>If I restart from tank 01 finished, is there some way to confirm that tank 02 is completely finished/will be accepted by the scientist? Because the red board with the lamps seems to mean nothing.</p>
<p>Restarted from before entering Lambda Core and did it in the correct sequence and finished the game.</p>
<p>Would have loved a G-Man ending, was a bit strange and cut off.</p>
<p>Teleports were hard and annoying.</p>
<p>Still, great job and can’t wait for the sequel  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
