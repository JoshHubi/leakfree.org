    <title>Crash: Lambda Core, bm_c3a2i, after &quot;My god! We&#39;ve got a breach!&quot;, and two floating Zen controllers appear</title>

    <description>In the Black Mesa, Lambda Core chapter, map bm_c3a2i, after the NPC says: &quot;My god! We&#39;ve got a breach!&quot;, and two floating Zen controllers appear, the game crashes with this following in the Windows 10 Application event log and no new DMP (minidump) files in my \Steam\dumps folder specific to this crash.   *(Sometimes the crash occurs after only one Zen controller and the NPC just says &quot;My god!&quot;)*

Faulting application name: hl2.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x470c11ae
Faulting module name: client.dll, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x504ecc4f
Exception code: 0xc0000005
Fault offset: 0x00362edd
Faulting process id: 0x31fc
Faulting application start time: 0x01d59ef4cd46d9c1
Faulting application path: D:\steam\steamapps\common\Source SDK Base 2007\hl2.exe
Faulting module path: d:\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\blackmesa\bin\client.dll
Report Id: ecef09c8-6f7d-4c4e-884c-15ec4e31715b
Faulting package full name: 
Faulting package-relative application ID: 

To troubleshoot this,
I checked the Source SDK Base 2007 integrity and Steam fixed 4 files, rebooted, but the crash still occurred at the same point, 
I&#39;m playing on a high end machine but I tried I turning down the game&#39;s video and audio settings, reduced the resolution to the minimum, and unchecked all #GameUI_BlackMesa setting check boxes, but again the crash still occurred at the same point.

System:
Windows 10 64 bit (Ver 1903)
GA-Z170X-Gaming 3 motherboard 
Radeon RX 480 GAMING 4G graphics card
Intel Core i7 6700K 4.00 GHz Quad Core
