    <title>2 loud beeps when connecting/disconnecting?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/2-loud-beeps-when-connecting-disconnecting/12472</link>
    <description>It&#39;s me again with another problem.   It&#39;s not that major but it is super annoying.

Background:
I have my desktop computer plugged into my laptop via a network cable and the laptop is connected to my brother&#39;s wireless router so that we can share the Internet (I live next door to my brother but in different apartments) via a network bridge.

My desktop is Windows 7 and my laptop is Vista.  I have no problem with accessing the Internet in this fashion.

However, if I reboot the laptop or otherwise disconnect from and reconnect to the Internet on the laptop, my desktop computer issues two very loud and high-pitched beeps.  I tracked it down by constantly disconnecting and reconnecting the laptop and the sound on my desktop is coming from the computer speakers (if my desktop is muted or I have the speakers turned down, the sound does not happen but the volume of the two beeps gets loud real fast when I turn the volume up).  If I have the volume mixer open when this happens, I can actually see that Windows is playing the sound (the meter goes up).

What is causing these beeps and, more importantly, how do I stop them?  It only happens when I disconnect or connect to the Internet on the laptop.  My Google-fu is apparently too weak to find the answer out on my own.

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Well, it appears that my issue was something that was very rare and unlikely to come up for anyone else here so I’m closing the thread.  Thanks, everyone, for their posts.</p>

<p>I knew it wasn’t “Default Beep” when I went through the Program Events list; the “Default Beep” sound is a different sound, but I tried the stopping/disabling the “Beep” device anyway.</p>
<p>Still getting the double-beeps.  Oh, and if this information is helpful, I’m getting the following dialog box as well:</p>
<p>“Windows has detected an IP address conflict<br>
Another computer on this network has the same IP address as this computer. Contact your network administrator for help resolving this issue. More details are available in the Windows System event log.”</p>
<p>I do not have any IP address issues just dismissing the dialog box and I don’t know if this is the cause of the two beeps.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>if windows shows a warning about the ip then you can be sure to have one .<br>
you should look in windows network and with tools that give information like hwinfo : <a href="https://www.hwinfo.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.hwinfo.com/</a> .</p>
<p>you should also look in the routers what are the ip in use and then select to give some ip to each cards according to the mac numbers of the network cards .</p>
<p>at least may be your wifi dongle also connect to a network of one of your neighbor , then lower the power to no longer reach it .</p>

            <p>So, I checked the BIOS and there doesn’t appear to be any sort of alarm function in there.  And this time, when I booted up, I got the two beeps when the network bridge was established so that my desktop can get on the Internet, and my laptop and desktop have different IPs, so I doubt it’s any sort of notification sound for an IP address conflict.</p>
<p>It’s strange that I cannot find a single reference to this happening anywhere on the Internet.</p>
<p>Like I said, this isn’t really too much of a problem but it is an annoyance and sometimes startles me when it happens unexpectedly and I was wondering if any of you guys know just what the blazes is going on here.  I don’t like my computer doing things like this but it could be something I can live with until I get my own Internet access and get off this network bridge set-up.</p>
<p>I’m just more curious than anything now.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t know if this helps, but I also use TightVNC on both the laptop and desktop so that I can remotely access one from the other and vice versa, so that I can control my desktop from my laptop while I’m in bed or control my laptop while I’m at my desktop.  It could be this that’s causing the beeping.  I could uninstall TightVNC on my desktop to see if that’s what’s causing it.  Hm…</p>
<p>EDIT: Solved!</p>
<p>It wasn’t TightVNC.  I use desktop gadgets from <a href="http://addgadgets.com">addgadgets.com</a> and one of the gadgets, the network meter, has an alert option for lost and restored connections.  I played the alert sound in that gadget and it was the double-beep sound.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usfiAsWR4qU#t=7s" data-bbcode="true">Hallelujah!</a></p>

            <p>These are both my home computers purchased new from a retail store (Fry’s, <a href="https://netaffilia.com/images/store/renton_frys.jpg" data-bbcode="true">this one right here</a>) so I doubt that it was a school computer but I will try out those settings you offered tomorrow.  I really need my computer online tonight for a college class and I don’t want to fuck with anything at the moment that might cause me to not be able to attend the online class.</p>

            <p>make sure on your desktop you set up the IP address as such:</p>
<p>IP address: 192.168.0.(10 to 199)<br>
Subnet Mask:  (let it auto-generate)<br>
Gateway: 192.168.0.1</p>
<p>dns: 192.168.0.1</p>
<p>and on the laptop (on the ethernet card):</p>
<p>IP Address: 192.168.0.1<br>
Subnet Mask:  (let it auto-generate)<br>
Gateway: blank</p>
<p>dns: blank</p>
<p>on the wireless card leave them both on auto</p>
<p>To find the IP address dialog box just open Network Connections and in the Properties dialog of the adapter, double-click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IP v4)</p>
<p>Also maybe this was a school computer or something and in the bios it has intrusion alarms enabled, if you know the BIOS password, disable it for all events and it should be fine.</p>

            <p>No, the double-beeps happen and then about a minute later I get the popup.  I’m not sure if they’re related as the popup sometimes happens, sometimes not.</p>
<p>I am not hindered in using either computer.  I’m just trying to track down why it’s playing and, more importantly, how to stop it.</p>

<p>Yes, I’ve already checked those, it’s not that.  I should’ve mentioned it.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Here’s a very quick Youtube video containing the sound of it happening.  Perhaps this might help identify what the sound is.</p>
