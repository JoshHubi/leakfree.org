    <title>Transparent pixels in site&#39;s logo</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/transparent-pixels-in-sites-logo/11101</link>
    <description>There are a few transparent pixels in the site&#39;s logo. (the one shown on a browser&#39;s tabs) This is unnoticeable on a white background, but for those with a dar theme, it makes the logo look weird.
