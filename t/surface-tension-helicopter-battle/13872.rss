    <description>The helicopter battle just felt really rough and difficult.

The RPG guidance was slow
The Helicopter seemed to have unlimited rockets
The [url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/8nsis1g0gi3lof6/2015-05-07_00060.jpg?dl=0]Rocks provided[/url] for cover [url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/zvjnpznfrgycy5w/2015-05-07_00061.jpg?dl=0]looked rushed[/url]

And the rockets were different sizes as the one in the [url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/vsnsw6tod08j7c2/2015-05-07_00048.jpg?dl=0]crate is a reskin[/url] and the one [url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/9x8pkta6su8vczc/2015-05-07_00051.jpg?dl=0]on the ground is much shorted and in a tube[/url].

It&#39;s nice it no longer takes 16 rockets like in the free version, but dying multiple times secounds into the music wasn&#39;t fun.</description>

            <p>Yeah, it’s still not great, but IMO it’s a lot better than how the fight played out in the mod version. Anyone who’s read my posts from a few years ago will know how I felt about that.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>After lobbing what seemed like dozens of rockets into the helicopter, I found it easier to just stuff a few overcharged Tau bolts into the helicopter than to use the rockets, to be honest. The Tau bolts never miss, don’t require you to peek out of cover for more than about a second, and they’re much stronger than the rockets. The only real downside is the ammo isn’t infinite.</p>
<p>This is kind of problematic, IMO.</p>

            <p>I had trouble with the aiming because of the incorrect collsion of the rocks you take cover behind. It looks as if you point at the heli but in relaity you aim at an invisible collision mesh very close to you which lets the rockets fly straight into the sky instead of heading towards the heli.<br>
I made a thread about that (as the meshes also caught my crossbow arrows in spite of free sight on the enemies).</p>
<p>Maybe that was the issue you had too.</p>
<p>because after I found out I aimed at invisble meshes the heli was quite easy when I avoided the meshes.</p>

            <p>So you have to toggle on the seeking of the rocket? so that is why I had to spend too much time defeating this. I just waited for it to calm down the fire and then I just fired a direct hit with no seeking at it. 5 of these and the chopper was done for.</p>

            <p>^ This.<br>
I agree it’s no fun at all.<br>
Developers should do something with heli. Machine gun on that thing has absolutely crazy accuracy. Rocket spam too is very accurate.<br>
If I remember correctly mod version has bigger MG fire spread. Now it looks like Freeman is a bullet magnet for helis.</p>

            <p>I felt I won this battle by gaming the system rather than through skill.  After dying a couple times, I took cover by the rocks on the left (as you exit the garage area and come to the mouth of the cave) next to the RPG crate.  The Helicopter couldn’t hit me while crouching and made no attempt to swing around to get line-of-sight on me, but I could hit it when I stood up.</p>
<p>Even though it’s true to the original, this felt like a real trial-by-fire.  You aren’t given any chance to familiarize (or re-familiarize) yourself with the RPG and its toggleable seeking (coming from HL2, I didn’t know there was a toggle, and I couldn’t tell when it was on or off in this open area) before you’re thrown into a big boss battle.</p>

            <p>Interesting, I thought it was much easier . Before the rockets went so fast you didn’t have time to guide them correctly. And If I remember correctly the helicopter always had the same about of rockets and the cover provided hasn’t changed at all.</p>
