    <title>Security Guard in UC won&#39;t fire if he doesn&#39;t have room to back up</title>

    <description>This is in regards to the Steam version (obviously).  The first living security guard you encounter in UC has this weird tendency to not fire his weapon unless he has room to back up.  If his back is up against a wall or even one of the benches in the locker room, he will not fire his pistol at all.  Instead, he&#39;ll aim his weapon at the enemy, mostly zombies so soon in the game, and just take the hits they send his way.  I guess he&#39;s invincible, since he took a shitton of hits which is important since at this point he&#39;s the only way you can kill anything.  Still, super frustrating to have to shove him away from a wall so he can continue his firing script.</description>

<p>I remember this bug caused a game breaking glitch in Unforeseen Consequences back when we were doing an intensive testing period before our Early Access release. I thought we’d fixed it.</p>
<p>I’ll report this to the brogrammers. Thanks for the post.</p>

<p>Something similar happened in the mod version as well.</p>
<p>If the guard is cornered/with his back against a wall, both him and the zombie attacking get stuck in an endless fight, as they seem to be invincible when this happens (in this case, they do hit each other, unlike this one when the guard won’t fire his gun). Thought I should bring this up as well just in case.</p>
