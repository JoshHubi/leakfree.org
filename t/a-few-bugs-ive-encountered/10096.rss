    <title>A few bugs I&#39;ve encountered</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-few-bugs-ive-encountered/10096</link>
    <description>1. Sometimes, the NPCs physical expressions are out of sync to their talking.

2. At the start in Anomalous Materials, when you go down the elevator  next to the shifting signs, the next map may, or may not load when the  elevator gets to the bottom. I had to reload my previous save and go  down it again.
The bug occurred when I reached the bottom with the elevator and then  climbed further down using the maintenance ladder to explore, and then climbed  back up, only to notice the map hadn&#39;t loaded.

3. The Gauss gun doesn&#39;t have a &#39;un-sprint&#39; animation when you stop holding the sprint key with it out. EDIT: Also has a purple/black checkerboard texture in DX8. [url]https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121608937567/03722C8B1E754771B62E6F96886CE95235D0E265/[/url]

4. If you are in DX8, the aberration and HUD PP show a diagonal white  line down your screen when enabled. It would be nice if those settings  were grayed out in DX8. [url]https://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121608937113/3B8F124A1C2F7908FB33F488B51B2DF09FBE389E/[/url]

5. If you are in DX8, the toxic green water will show a checkerboard.

6. Not really a bug, but more of a nitpick: When you go into the load  game/save game window where it shows the list of save files, the ones  with no preview thumbnail show the HL2 logo, and not a custom Black Mesa  logo.

7. If you are in DX8, the revolver&#39;s texture will show a purple/black checkerboard. [url]https://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121608936149/430BC5A529AB5FB28B7EEA8D463DBA74C2DCA4C1/[/url]

8. Some cubemaps show purple/black checkerboards. I mostly noticed this in Lambda core.

9. If you are in DX8; when going underwater into the pipe after you&#39;ve pressed the button in the dam tower, your screen will show a purple/black checkerboard screen overlay. [url]https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121608936769/BA8C47F02BA30418FC7F53BB261B15593D8C2853/[/url]

10. If you are in DX8, the cubemaps will show in fullbright on most models, even viewmodels. (I think that&#39;s due to no cubemap mask.) [url]https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121608932212/B045FAA971B238278D42A286773F2D4072C012BC/[/url]

11. If you are in DX8; the Hivehand has a purple/black checkerboard texture. [url]https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121609713367/34B90728B2982844DC2B30A8AC00B2A79949379F/[/url] [url]https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121609712102/0D070571B900C0C854CFAEA9AA53F92787DD5D57/[/url]

12. If you are in DX8; the Glock has a purple/black checkerboard texture. [url]https://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121609714852/98EB2C365BC0D2DE037E5957A372256DFD5F60E7/[/url]

13. If you are in DX8; human NPCs have purple/black eyes. [url]https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/920115121609711774/920F449E47308B528E98D0273FA6FA14C41F1862/[/url]

TL;DR: Insufficient DX8 support.


EDIT: I will supply some screenshots for some of the bugs listed, to make the devs lives easier!</description>

<p>No, it’s not time to upgrade. I have a perfectly fine computer, a 2009 computer. I run DirectX 9.0 fine on med-high settings. You asking why I even need DX8 support at this age is like asking why we need DX9 support. They are both old, in fact, DX9c is from 2003, so by your logic, seeing as DX8 is old, and DX9 is from 2003, we should just stop supporting that too. If you start asking “Well, why do you need DX8 support?” Well, some people don’t like how DX9 looks, and can get a potential performance boost. Devs, you should read this, it may seem like pointless work for you, but you will satisfy people who have sub-par computers. For all our sake, please support DX8.</p>
<p>Thanks for being as equally constructive as the other guy. It’s appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And by your logic we should still be supporting DirectX 7 and so on. Gotta cut it off somewhere, and since pretty much everyone these days runs DirectX 9 games perfectly fine, why support 8?</p>
<p>It takes a lot of extra work to ensure support for all this outdated shit that nobody even still uses.</p>

<p>In my opinion, even sub-par computers in these days should run DX9 perfectly fine and should find no real benefit performance wise from using DX8, but that’s just my opinion.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Another confirmation of number 2 here. Jumping out of the elevator before it’s finished moving seems to be what let me bypass triggering the next area load. When it <em>does</em> work, the next area loads before you fully exit the elevator, so exploring the rest of the elevator shaft seems to be irrelevant.</p>
