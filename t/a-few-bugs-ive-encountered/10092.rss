    <title>A few bugs I&#39;ve encountered</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-few-bugs-ive-encountered/10092</link>
    <description>1. Sometimes, the NPC&#39;s physical expressions are out of sync to their talking.

2. At the start in Anomalous Materials, when you go down the elevator next to the shifting signs, the next map may, or may not load when the elevator gets to the bottom. I had to reload my previous save and go down it again.
The bug occurred when I reached the bottom with the elevator and then climbed further down the maintenance ladder to explore, and then climbed back up, only to notice the map hadn&#39;t loaded.

3. The Gauss gun doesn&#39;t have a &#39;un-sprint&#39; animation when you stop holding the sprint key with it out.

4. If you are in DX8, the aberration and HUD PP show a diagonal white line down your screen when enabled. It would be nice if those settings were grayed out.

5. If you are in DX8, the toxic green water will show a checkerboard.

6. Not really a bug, but more of a nitpick: When you go into the load game/save game window where it shows the list of save files, the ones with no preview thumbnail show the HL2 logo, and not a custom Black Mesa logo.

7. If you are in DX8, the revolver&#39;s texture will show a purple/black checkerboard.

8. Some cubemaps show purple/black checkerboards. I mostly noticed this in Lambda core.</description>
