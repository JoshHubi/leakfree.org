    <title>FIX: Anyone crashing on level load</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fix-anyone-crashing-on-level-load/10599</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve seen a lot of people posting about issues with the game crashing on level load, even the very first load screen when you&#39;re on the tram.

If you are running Windows 7, dollars to donuts you have Steam installed to the Program Files folder, (x86) or otherwise. You&#39;re going to have to uninstall Steam and reinstall it somewhere else, preferably the &#39;Games&#39; folder of your C: or on any other drive if you have them. Windows 7 handles stuff installed in Program Files as a major security risk and places all kinds of firewalls between the application and outside folders, this prevents Black Mesa from accessing the static player.info that it needs to transfer over from level to level, causing the crash.

Moving Steam should fix the issue and the game should run normally.</description>
