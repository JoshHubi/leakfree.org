    <title>Weapons lost after crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weapons-lost-after-crash/10668</link>
    <description>After a crash somewhere near the end of &quot;Questionable ethics&quot; I lost access to weapon options 4 and 5 as well as the Crossbow. I can still pick up ammo as evidenced by picking up depleted uranium rounds in &quot;Surface tension&quot; but the weapons do not show up either by clicking on the number pad, or scrolling through weapons.

Please help, my last actual save (as opposed to quick save) was 4 hours before.

Attached are 2 mdmp files, I apologize that I am not sure which one is responsible.
