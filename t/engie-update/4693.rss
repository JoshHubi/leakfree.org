<p>Replacements because even though they are new weapon models, they behave the same as the weapons they replace.  For instance, the pyro’s new thrower is functionally equivalent to his standard thrower rather than being a modified thrower like the backburner.  I consider the backburner a “new weapon” rather than a “replacement”. I dont know if that makes sense lol.  Basically, if you were to never find any of those weapons, you would not miss out on any unique attacks or weapon functions.</p>
<p>O Im no W+M1 whore, compression blast ftw.  Pyros are just a versatile all-around class.  Good for defense and offense.  I especially love causing chaos.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I see what you mean. They will, however, be new weapons. Valve has stated that they are attaching gameplay attributes to the new models, so they will be new weapons.</p>
<p>And I was joking about the W+M1 too, of course. When pyros know how to play well they are huge assets to the team, unfortunately they get a bad rap since they get picked all the time by noobs who don’t know how to play yet  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Uh, what do you mean “replacements”? They’re going to be released as weapons and hats you can find in-game, which is why the blog says they’re attaching gameplay attributes to the items. Just like they have always done with community-created content.</p>

            <p>So, how about them Polycount Packs? They announced the winners not too long ago. I’m looking forward to them, they all look pretty sweet, especially that new rocket launcher. And now there’s finally going to be a replacement for the spy’s knife, which is also pretty kickass. Should be interesting to see what the new flamethrower and sniper rifle do. Plus that fish for the scout looks pretty funny  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Good point.  I don’t actually understand people complaining about the crazy amount of engineers in servers.  I have never ever had so much fun playing a spy as I have in the fast few days.  I actually obtained the achievement “Sap Auteur” (destroy 1000 buildings with sappers) in about 3 hours playing as a spy.</p>
<p>Basically, I ran behind enemy lines, disguised as engineer, took out the sapper and just jumped around randomly pressing the left mouse button, and I had killed at least 10 engineer buildings in a minute.  And then I cloaked again, watching all the engineers run around repairing buildings like mad, shooting everyone and everything and eventually rebuilding everything for my next minute of hilarious fun. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Ubered demoman sounds like a lot of fun as well.  I hope that it hasn’t died down yet and me and my buddy can find a server with a bunch of engineers playing. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I know, I never said he was incorrect.  The thing I believe people may not realize is that the wrangler update simply allows engineers to put their SG in spots that used to be suicide.  The wrangler does not effect the classic, normal SG spots that have been used for years.</p>
<p>For instance, intel guarding on 2fort and doublecross do not need the wrangler.  Those are both small rooms with multiple entrances, definitely best to let the SG sort it out.  Now however, consider the 2fort sewers.  Before the update it was stupid to put a SG at the foot of the stairs in the sewers, the tunnel is waaay too long and out of SG range.  The wrangler however, changes that.</p>
<p>Basically, the wrangler allows an SG to guard choke points over long distances, distances that are normally out of range.  When using the wrangler you have to be sure to put your SG in a safer spot with less access.  The engineer has to guard all vulnerable positions manually.  Like Katana said, engineers are doing the defense, not the sentry.</p>

Basically, the wrangler is a godsend to spies because it introduces human error otherwise not present. It makes sentries a lot more vulnerable to stealth maneuvers. I mean, if the engineer is killed within 10 feet of the sentry, that makes for a pretty easy sap because of the sentry-cooldown.</p>

<p>Indeed, but what Katana is saying is still true. I had also originally considered it OP, but after trying it I can see Valve really did their homework and kept the gameplay balanced. Just like every other weapon, if you know how to use it you can do well, but like the other it does have disadvantages. I’ve also found that in the places you would most likely want to use it are the areas where you are most likely to get sniped. I got headshotted so many times trying to get a Wrangler achievement. :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>The engineer update definitely improves the offensive and front-line-defensive capabilities.  Upgrade SGs and dispensers in front of spawn.  Carry upgraded dispenser to safe spot near front line, go back and carry SG to front line, than move dispenser up.  Put the dispenser in a spot behind the SG to heal you while you can still repair the two.  All you need is a good pyro for SG defense.  Once one SG is established, have another engineer repeat the same process and back up your SG with his.</p>
<p>For instance, establishing multiple SGs on the bridge in doublecross, with pyros helping with defense, is a great strategy to win.  I have already had instances of totaling over 60 kills with a lone SG and a single pyro for support.  Of course, it still only takes one good ubered demo to ruin it all, but most teams are stupid.</p>
