    <title>Is it possible to use onboard video and graphics card together??</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-it-possible-to-use-onboard-video-and-graphics-card-together/1527</link>
    <description>My motherboard is an [b]ASUS P5N73-AM w/NVIDIA GeForce 7050/nForce610i chipset[/b]. I have an [b]NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GSO[/b] graphics card which is connected via the PCI-E slot. Could someone please tell me how to get both the onboard video and graphics card to work together, if possible. I searched around on then net but couldn&#39;t find anything which clearly told me that this can&#39;t happen, that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking. :retard:</description>

<p>You should check out your BIOS for video features, there should be an option like “default video adapter” and the choices should be something like “PCI-E/ONBOARD/BOTH”</p>
<p>My onboard graphics card is a GMA3100 or something so I’m never gonna use it, even if my 8800GT goes boom I’ll just use my laptop instead.</p>

</aside>
<p>My BIOS gives me 3 options : PCI-E, PCI or ONBOARD. So no “BOTH” for me.<br>
Anyway, thanks for your reply.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>ATI has a hybrid crossfire mode, which connects the onboard to the card, but its for ATI mobos with ATI cards.</p>

            <p>The latest nVidia motherboard chipsets+cards have these sort of features, while Dell mobos explicitly disable the onboard the moment anything else is connected, no matter what.<br>
As for other mobos/cards, I don’t really know.</p>

            <p>some onboard video cards can work together as far as I know, but I think only that way, that the onboard one is for desktop and the real one for 3D apps</p>

            <p>Nope. It’s only one or the other.<br>
You can get two PCI-E x16 cards working together, generally if they’re the same model/series (I don’t know much about crossfire, but I assume it’s close to SLI). If there’s no way to bridge the connection (SLI has special connectors that attach the two cards), then you can’t get them working together.<br>
There’s probably a way to dedicate one to a certain process, and another to a different process, but I don’t know much about that subject.</p>
