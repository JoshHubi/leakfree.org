            <p>Funny enough. Definitely could have been less minimalistic about it.<br>
People can chuckle at the weirdos on My Strange Addiction and Obsessed and Hoarders because they’ve got more than one fucked up trait to their condition.</p>
<p>The boy in the video here keeps a straight face, doesn’t interact with anyone besides the cameramen.<br>
His salami fetish is funny but the execution is fatally subtle.<br>
Subtlety is rare among humorous items and this normally goes hand in hand with rapid fire gags that you have to trust the audience to notice.<br>
You’ve dragged one good idea out for 7.5 minutes. Someone with an idea of timing and flavor could have done it right but the thing i just watched felt like a bucket of sludge that wasn’t lame enough to suck, but not substantial enough to laugh about and show my friends.</p>
<p>I liked the video and I’ll remember a few items of it for perhaps a decade, if not five. The forum was my favorite bit.</p>

            <p>I have no idea what to even say about this. I don’t know if I’d call this funny or depressing. I will say that there was a bit too much blur.</p>
