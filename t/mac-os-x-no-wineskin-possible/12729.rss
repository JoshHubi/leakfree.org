    <title>Mac OS X – No Wineskin? Possible?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mac-os-x-no-wineskin-possible/12729</link>
    <description>So, you can now install SDK Source 2007 on Mac, so technically Black Mesa should be playable on Mac. However, even after installing it on my non-wineskin Steam client, Black Mesa would not launch even with it in the sourcemods folder and SDK Source 2007 installed. Anyone have an idea how to fix this?</description>

<p>If I’m a noob? I explained in my post how I’m trying to NOT use Wineskin since SDK 2007 Source was just recently released for Mac, which technically should make it playable WITHOUT wineskin. Wineskin is a pain in the arse to use and I have been playing through Black Mesa with it up to this point, but if I were to natively run it it would probably have a higher FPS and be easier to launch.</p>

</aside>
<p>SDK 2007 supports Mac, but the mod’s FILES are still in Windows format. You still need Wineskin for now.</p>
