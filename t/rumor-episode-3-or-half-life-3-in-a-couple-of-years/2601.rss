<p>It was video footage, and Gabe <span class="bbcode-i">was</span> talking about Episode 3. I think that’s a good enough reason.</p>

<p>did you really honestly think that it was cancelled??</p>
<p>VALVe wouldnt ever cancel half-life 2 episode 3 (or Half-Life 3, no one i sure yet)if they did that would be the most fuck up thing VALVe could do</p>

            <p>If Valve makes a HL3, I wonder if it will be as vastly different and improved as HL1 went from HL2.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll finally figure who G-Man is working for…</p>

            <p>Ech… VALVE stated from the beginning that there will be no HL3. Not now. They decided to go with the episodes to speed up the “storytelling” so that the players wouldn’t have to wait ~5 years to see what happens next. Finish the story, THEN go to HL3.</p>
<p>Nobody here has shown any proof denying VALVEs “first plan” and I don’t think they’ll change it. Why? Because they’re too deep in this. Next HL probably would include a brand new engine (let’s face it, how long can you modify a 6-year-old code).</p>
<p>BUT…</p>
<p>Everything would have been clear if it wasn’t for VALVE’s silence regarding Ep3. No info, no screenshots, no nothing. Why? I used to think that they modified Source so drasticly that the game alone looks totally different (/awesome  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  ) and they wanted to keep it a secret. Truth is any game media they’d release would blow up the bubble so that makes sence…</p>
<p>Nonetheless if it will be an Episode Three then I hope to see it soon (polishing, making it superubermegaawesome is important but 2,5 years for an Episode? It didn’t take that long with 1&amp;2 and they turned out great). If it’ll be HL3 then they could say something, ANYTHING so we’ll know what we’re waiting for…</p>

            <p>The problem was that they wanted the game to be the best it could be. Whenever a new, better game engine came out, they would completely restart on that engine, they just couldn’t keep up.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Whoa Whoa Whoa, I just read through this whole thread (lots of shit), and well I can’t remember where I heard/read this but I’m pretty damn sure HL2: Episode 3 will be the last game in the series I’m probably wrong because I’ve been known to be wrong before, but hey it would make sense so Gordon Freeman won’t get franchise raped. :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>Dont really have a interest to spam what I posted there.  Just desided to post it just because it was on topic.  Not like I joined the forums to post that considering I joined over 12 hours ago and that just happened to be my first post.</p>
<p>I will say that I am on Valves message board with Marc Laidlaw answers reading what is posted and it is apparent like all writters his ideas can change over time.</p>
<p>Wont change what I stated that there will be a HL3 or that there will be a Episode 3.  Episode 3 should be ending the next story in the series which is the episodes, that is unless valve desides to just junk the third episode and goes with making HL3 which would be a full length game itself.</p>

            <p>I havent seen any contradiction information first hand yet but the last information I seen was Valve was saying that the Episodes were supposed to be combined to make HL3 they just choosed the episode format to get the game released quickly by releasing it in small episode formats.  Which I recall even Valve stated it didnt work out how they planned it to.</p>
<p>But as been stated here there will be a HL3 because they dont have a game called HL3.  The episodes are supposed to be the third game which is why after Episode 3 this story arc is supposed to be finished and a new HL story will be told.  So in the end me stating all this doesnt really matter because regardless of the episodes being the third story their still called HL2 EP1/EP2/EP3.</p>
<p>So I dont just come off as stating something as cannon without proof as was done earlier on in this topic I will post a link to the first site I found in a just did search pertaining to what I stated.  I didnt orignally hear it from these people but its the same exact article basically.</p>

            <p>On the Orange Box’s website, when you scroll over HL2: Episode 2, it has a caption that says “The Trilogy Continues”.</p>
<p>Now, unless this gets removed by Valve, I’m going to ignore all rumours.</p>
