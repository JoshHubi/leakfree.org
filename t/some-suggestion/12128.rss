    <title>Some suggestion.</title>

    <description>I just remembered, that when you get hit with projectile that generates spatter effects like; blood, spit etc etc. Basically making it realistic.

I suggest somewhat the same effect when rising from bodies of water; the view models could be dripping wet too.

Another special effect i want to suggest is that make the muzzle-flash 3D-ish, simmilar to the muzzle-flash they generate on the world model, but just significantly smaller.

In the original game, the flashlight has a battery, so i suggest a battery lifetime for the flashlight.

Another change is want to suggest is that allow gibbing of corpses with crowbar, just as long as players hit the corpses a few more times.

Lastly, for the Tau-Cannon. I would suggest it to be revamped; not just a simple-beam, add some lightning effects simmilar to the HL2 Beta version and SMOD of the Tau-Cannon. And for the Tau-Cannon model-view, i suggest a handle for the other hand much like the COD death machine, to look much more realistic; that the other handle is needed for such gun to be controlled properly.

            <p>… They’re not going to change it…?</p>
<p>The mod has been out for months already. It would take a ludicrous amount of time and effort to change something that’s purely cosmetic, just because of one guy on the forum who has a different vision from what the devs had in mind.</p>
<p>They removed the battery in the flashlight on purpose, mostly because it was a useless feature that contributed nothing to gameplay. There weren’t any practical gameplay implications of a draining flashlight battery at any point in HL1, because there were no dark areas made dark specifically to be used with the flashlight.</p>
<p>Besides, this is the wrong forum for that sort of stuff.</p>
