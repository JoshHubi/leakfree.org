    <title>What would you like to see announced at E3 2011?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-would-you-like-to-see-announced-at-e3-2011/7287</link>
    <description>Yeah the title pretty much explains it, I personally would love to hear what Valve has to say at E3 this year. It&#39;s a long shot, but I&#39;m definitely hoping for an announcement on Episode 3/ Half life 3(unlikely). Any other time if someone said that to me I would tell them to keep dreaming, but with the release or portal 2 came a few subtle hints regarding Episode 3.

<p>Thanks, Commander Retard, ehm Dotard. So, when Valve always says that they aren’t going to do something, they <span class="bbcode-b">are</span> going to do something, so we can complain if they aren’t going to do anything. That’s awesome. We can bitch about things that have never been announced, just to annoy Valve! Yay!</p>

            <p>I’ll hope for something unexpected (games that are still pretty much rumor) such as:<br>
-Company of heroes 2?<br>
-The new splinter cell game? (it think ubi is still working on ghost recon tho)<br>
-Halo?<br>
-HL2:Episode 3?<br>
-Command &amp; Conquer?<br>
-Star wars battlefront 3?<br>
-Half Life 3?<br>
-GTA5?</p>
<p>And probably something expected:<br>
-Battlefield 3<br>
-Modern Warfare 3<br>
-AC: Revelations</p>
<p>The rest is just hope…</p>

            <p>What would I like to see announced?<br>

HomeWorld 3<br>
MechWarrior 3015<br>
STALKER 2<br>

<p>Once again with the idiotic optimism. If they say they’re not going to do something very specific in the near future, then they’re not going to do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, there’s nearly a 0% chance but god dammit I want to see Star Wars Battlefront III.</p>

<p>I would laugh so hard if the statement sent out to everybody was a red herring, given how underwhelming their ‘surprise’ last year left many people sore. This year it would be a ‘SURPRISE’</p>
