            <p>usually going by the date you can tell if its made for the mod or retail and beiing as the mod was released over 3 years ago i’m guessing that level is for retail , You could try serching on ModDB or gamebanna for bm Mod levels But i don’t think many were made, i can’t remember any that were released</p>
