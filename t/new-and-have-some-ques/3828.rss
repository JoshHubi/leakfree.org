    <title>New and have some ques.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-and-have-some-ques/3828</link>
    <description>Okay I am a noob and like &quot;Most&quot; noobs,

what does a red and purple folder next to a post mean.

I guess it means that my posts suck or have already been covered. -_-

Well I tried to find some sort of a legend for the forum icons but I can&#39;t find it.</description>
