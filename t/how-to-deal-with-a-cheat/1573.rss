She said she is sorry and that she regreted her actions. she said that her friend over there persuaded her to do it. she still claim to love me but i dont understand what kind of love to call this now. i have spent  money on this girl yet this how she decided to pay me back.

            <p>No-one has ‘the right’ to beat anyone, you moron. It’s illegal and unethical and childish, and when the person in question is physically weaker or smaller than yourself (as a woman normally is compared to a man) then it’s disgusting and cowardly bullying. Cheating is detestable, but civilised adults are supposed to have better ways of dealing with things.</p>

            <p>Jeg kan taler lidt dansk.</p>
<p>I guess Danish pronunciation and spelling is pretty strange too. Spanish doesn’t have any silent letters, besides h but that’s all the time, that I can think of. I really want to learn Italian though, and I wish they had it instead of French. Japanese too. And Russian. And Arabic.</p>
<p>:fffuuu: Too many languages!</p>

            <p>Actually I for one prefer the European French way of speaking. <span class="bbcode-i">“Joual”</span>, the way we Québecer say things, is very different from the “Arpitan” or the “Roman”, french way of speaking, but I however think that most of Québecers uses Joual as an excuse to butcher French. I think Joual sounds more, well, I wouldn’t say Barbaric, but close. Note that my opinion doesn’t represent the opinion of Québecers in general. It’s actually the opposite.</p>

            <p>Oh, I didn’t see the reference to English being related to French.</p>
<p>While English is Germanic in origin, much of its vocabulary comes from Latin, the work of trading.  For example, “kettle”.</p>

<p>There are a lot of languages where some letters are “mute”. Actually pretty much all languages that comes from Latin (Romance* languages to be precise) have those mute letters. English got them too since it originates from French and Celtic and Saxon dialects.</p>
<p>*The word Romance in that case if from the latin word <span class="bbcode-i">romanice</span>, which comes from the expression <span class="bbcode-i">“romanice loqui”</span>, which means “to speak in latin”. So basically it means languages whose origins are latin.[/SIZE]</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>English is a Germanic language. The only influence it has from French is in vocabulary.<br>
In a lot of the cases of unpronounced letters in English it is the result of the pronunciation changing over time, and the spelling not following that change, like is the case with knee.</p>

<p>That’s what i think all the time. Why do they have letters in their words when they don’t pronounce it like that?! It’s ridiculous and unnecesary. It sounds awesome,but common! Have some logic in they way of how you write your language. <span class="bbcode-b">No offence though to French people and people who invented French.</span></p>

<p>There are a lot of languages where some letters are “mute”. Actually pretty much all languages that comes from Latin (Romance* languages to be precise) have those mute letters. English got them too since it originates from French and Celtic and Saxon dialects.</p>
<p>*The word Romance in that case if from the latin word <span class="bbcode-i">romanice</span>, which comes from the expression <span class="bbcode-i">“romanice loqui”</span>, which means “to speak in latin”. So basically it means languages whose origins are latin.[/SIZE]</p>

            <p>Mont_Blanc, Mr.Shadow meant that you don’t pronounce the ‘le’ at the end of appelle.<br>
Mr.Shadow, Mont_Blanc thought you meant you don’t pronounce the ‘elle’ at the end of appelle.</p>
<p>French isn’t the only language that has elements that aren’t pronounced. English is and Dutch also have those, and English is at least as bad as French in that department.</p>

            <p>well I was wrong about Je m’appelle and we don’t speak the last syllable and since we have to learn the accents(I don’t know why) I thought it was spoken like that by French people as well.</p>
