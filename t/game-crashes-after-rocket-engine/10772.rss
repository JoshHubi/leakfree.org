    <title>Game crashes after rocket engine</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-after-rocket-engine/10772</link>
    <description>As the topic says the game crashes for me when going down the hole after the three-headed monster gets killed by the rocket engine. 

I don&#39;t know how to get past this part. Half way down the hole the game is loading the next area, but it crashes instead. Really annoying.

I would really appreciate some help.</description>
