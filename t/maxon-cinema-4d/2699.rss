    <description>does anyone use C4D, too? im using R11 since 2009 and try to figure out the point-to-point modelling (now i&#39;m always taking finish basic objects, cut them and move their points) and mograph. also i try out with the particle emitters.
and i didn&#39;t still get to make a camera switch to another camera who follows an object during an animation.

so anyone maybe knows a bit about the above problems?

i&#39;m no more a beginner, i started with release 8 in 2003 but i didn&#39;t have the time to continue working with it. so if anyone could help me a bit that would be really great! maybe too someone would make a new scene with me together?</description>
