            <p>Not quite. You need to install the Source SDK <span class="bbcode-i">BASE</span> 2007, which you can find in your Steam Library Tools tab. Also if you install BM, if the Base isn’t installed it should automatically do that for you when you run BM. The SDK Base is what’s used to play mods, whereas the SDK is for developing them. The mention of the SDK on HL2’s store page is a relic from before it was free to all Steam users.</p>

            <p>Yea, but what I mean is: I know that Black Mesa needs SDK, aaaand I haven’t got SDK installed, but on HL2 Steam page it says that it has got Source SDK (HL2). So HL2 installed=Source SDK?</p>
