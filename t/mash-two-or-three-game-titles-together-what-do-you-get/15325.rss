    <title>Mash two or three game titles together. What do you get?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mash-two-or-three-game-titles-together-what-do-you-get/15325</link>
    <description>Take two or three game titles and mash them together without losing any of the words or changing their position, then describe what this new game is about.

They have to play off each other. Don&#39;t just mash game titles that have no words in common. For example: Grand Theft Auto + Auto Modellista = Grand Theft Auto Modellista.

I&#39;ll start:

[b]Half-Life is Strange[/b] - After a scientific experiment goes catastrophic, a young female scientist called Max Caulfield must struggle to fight off dangerous creatures from another dimension while dealing with her problematic childhood friend Chloe Price.

[b]Perfect Dark Souls[/b] - Joanna Dark must use her extensive arsenal of futuristic weapons and gadgets to survive in the world of Lordran and rekindle the fire.</description>

            <p>How about y’all read the OP a little more than not at all.</p>
<p>It’s not just mashing two random titles together, they have to flow into each other naturally and with no missing words.</p>
<p>Like this: Middle Earth - Shadow of Warcraft.</p>
