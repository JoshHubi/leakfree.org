    <title>Major FPS drop in Assassin Room.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/major-fps-drop-in-assassin-room/10112</link>
    <description>I notice major FPS drop in the Main Big Room before you get knocked out where the assassin&#39;s fight you after i load a quick save or normal save in that room and in the elevator before you talk to the guard. When i exit that room the FPS goes back to where i can play the game smooth again. Just thought to let the Dev&#39;s know about this. ^_^</description>
