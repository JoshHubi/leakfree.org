    <description>I look through the screenshots, and what i see is a concrete bunker, not a research facility. rubble all over the place, pallets leaned against the wall, crates everywhere.
but if this is a research facility, shouldn&#39;t hallways be kept clear and the complex cleaned? sure, the resonance cascade damaged the complex somewhat, but the disorganization of everything in the screenshots is positively human caused.
I&#39;m not asking you to change everything, that would be impractical, but can you just explain to me what is going on?</description>

            <p>Would there have been much need for a cover story at all, what with the whole 7 hour war and all?  Or they could have just said they were a new conventional bomb development site, that had a nuke reactor, and something went wrong, and then went boom (due to a large conventinal bomb) and the reason for the radiation was it blew the crap out of the reactor too.</p>

            <p>Some people are ragging on Hollywood-style nuclear explosions from nuclear plants.  The thing you have to remember is:  An explosion that the movie needs doesn’t have to be nuclear in origin to have the shape of a mushroom cloud.  A very large rock from outer space hitting the Earth could cause one.  I was boiling water on a stove once and forgot about it until about half the water was gone.  I took the lid off the pot and what came out but a “mushroom cloud” of steam.</p>
<p>And, by the way, if you’re looking for realism in movies…</p>

            <p>Your posts are a joy to read, they really are.</p>
<p>There is proof that the public was aware of Black Mesa and the fact that it was a research facility. They had a “Civilian Recruitment Division” and employees were encouraged to recommend friends and relatives to join the Black Mesa team.</p>
<p>Some of the labs would be high security, authorized personnel only, where employees would not be able to discuss their work with people outside of their team.</p>
<p>Also, of course aliens teleported to places other than Black Mesa. They spread across the globe during the portal storms.</p>

            <p>I just think black mesa is a super secret laboratory working on secret documents and secret operations inside it and the ppl of the closest city to it think it is a freggin supermarket wich they never saw because was so far from their place, that could explain the logo in the vehicles and when the nuke of the black ops destroyed black mesa how any1 knew where it was the gorvenment said it was a nuke/rocket test to defend the USA from any danger wich could damage it…</p>
<p>in other words: black mesa secret, ppl thinks it’s something wich isn’t a super-secret laboratories without knowing it really is and the government lied about the nuke… well lied 'til the vorts came…</p>
<p>wait a minute the alien maybe didn’t only teleported inside black mesa… because if they got only teleported inside BM they would be all dead by the nuke and in hl2 we can see some groups of vorts, specially in ep 2…</p>
<p>if this is what happened it changes all: the government said the truth to all the ppl then the combine came did a war of 7 hours and won, humanity and vortigaunts were enslaved an everybody (except the humans and vorts) was happy</p>

            <p>It is probably a research facility for research into the field of “how to store explosive barrels in the most dangerous fashion”. Looking at some of the screenshots, where barrels are stacked in such a way that it is basically impossible to go through those places without steering wildly from left to right, it really does seem so. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I have yet to see a game where there are explosive barrels and yet they are NOT placed illogically. “Concerned” comics parodizes this for Half-Life 2 nicely.</p>

            <p>I know that they <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> explode, just not nuclear bomb style. Virtually all modern reactors have thick concrete safety domes around the reactor; even if it does explode, the nuclear materials will be more or less contained, and any resulting Corium Lava will simply pool at the bottom of the building and/or solidify, like at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.<br>

<p>What?</p>
<p>My point is that that particular cover-up <span class="bbcode-i">wouldn’t</span> work, because it’s impossible for a nuclear reactor to explode; you have to refine nuclear materials further than reactor-grade for them to be usable in a nuclear bomb. Heck, even going “super-critical”  means the reactor is set to ‘high’.</p>
<p>More info <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Quoted for truth. Nuclear reactors are often kept at critical mass to maintain the reaction. Sub-critical mass reactors would eventually shut off. When a reactor is kept at super-critical mass for too long, they just get too hot and begin melting the pressure vessel, and the radioactive moderator starts to leak out. There are no explosions involved whatsoever, although this is still an emergency situation. Reactors, especially a modern one like what there would be at BMRF, have so many safety blankets and redundancy systems built into them now that if a super-critical mass reactor got out of hand, the dampening rods would be inserted and the core would be flooded with coolant instantly. They learned a bit since Three Mile Island and Chernobyl <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>@ UrBY: I’m with rorriMAesU on this one.  Nuclear plants, although they’re far less green than something like solar panels, they’re far more efficient at energy production.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, I’d say the government <span class="bbcode-i">still</span> isn’t really all that into the whole “green energy” thing just yet… at least not beyond the “publicity stunt” stage, where they might use green energy in certain areas which receive public attention, but certainly not in “behind-the-scenes” places like Black Mesa.</p>
<p>And this is 2010.  We’re already past the latest 200X deadline in which the Resonance Cascade supposedly occurred…  Considering this, personally I highly doubt there would have been any solar panels in Black Mesa during the time of Gordon’s employment (save for any satellites they may have been working on, including the one Gordon launched).</p>
<p>As far as windmills go, I figure that’s what they have the hydroelectric dam for.  A dam is far more reliable as a source of energy than a windmill, because the flow of water is, for the most part, much more constant than the flow and directionality of wind… why spend money building windmills when you could optimize/restructure/add more turbines to the dam?</p>
<p>@ Pyro:  I wouldn’t say <span class="bbcode-i">impossible</span>.  Just <span class="bbcode-i">unlikely</span>.  Nuclear reactors <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> explode, but the resulting damage isn’t due to the blast radius, but rather the released radioactive material.  The real problem is that both Chernobyl and Hollywood* have done an excellent job of burning into most people’s minds the idea that if it’s “nuclear” and/or a “reactor” of some sort, than it’s inherently a highly unstable ticking time bomb, just waiting for the right moment to blow up and destroy everything.  Critics of the “Nuclear Accident at Black Mesa” news story would probably just be hailed as crazy conspiracy theorists and lunatics by the media… I mean, honestly, <span class="bbcode-i">what possible motive</span> could our government have to <span class="bbcode-i">blow up</span> a perfectly innocent research facility?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Maybe I’m just too cynical, and don’t have enough faith in the American media/public… but personally, I don’t think it would be that far-fetched to say that a nuclear cover up <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> work, and not because of its scientific authenticity, but because most of the public would probably buy the story hook line and sinker.</p>
<p>After all, it’s not about what’s true.  It’s about what’s <span class="bbcode-i">believed</span> to be true.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>What?</p>
<p>My point is that that particular cover-up <span class="bbcode-i">wouldn’t</span> work, because it’s impossible for a nuclear reactor to explode; you have to refine nuclear materials further than reactor-grade for them to be usable in a nuclear bomb. Heck, even going “super-critical”  means the reactor is set to ‘high’.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Government knows solar panels and wind turbines are, in actuality, too immature for truly practical use (too expensive, inconstant/not reliable, poor power to area ratio) especially during the time of HL.  The government would most likely use nuclear or hydroelectric to power the facility.</p>
<p>Also, there is a lot of top secret work going on so the media and public eye will be involved as little as possible.</p>
<p>To stay on topic, it’s like Ram said, the facility is huge and the majority of it is pristine, but you do not see the majority of the facility since you are hiding <span class="bbcode-i">behind the scenes</span>.</p>

            <p>Oops, silly me. But Muh knows what I mean that it’s not the ultimate source of power of Black Mesa but rather for providing the lambda teleporter with energy.</p>

            <p>Power_Dust: Something that delivers energy over a period of time is a source of power, by definition.  Power is defined as a rate of energy transmission.</p>
<p>Although you have a point, the Lambda Core might not the <span class="bbcode-i">ultimate</span> source of that power, the ultimate source could be the hydro-electric dam for all we know…  But considering the sheer amount of energy that’s probably required to do something like open a wormhole to a border dimension, personally I don’t think a nuclear reactor somewhere in the facility would be out of the question.  (Heck, where <span class="bbcode-i">else</span> could all that radioactive green stuff come from?)</p>
