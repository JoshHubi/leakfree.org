    <title>Black Mesa in VR?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-in-vr/12504</link>
    <description>Ok, so I barely know anything about Source engine development. (I&#39;m going to get into it soon, but I want to learn more about game development and scripting  as a whole first.) However, there is something I was wondering. The Oculus Rift, the first real, possibly successful attempt at Virtual Reality in video games, is just over the hill, with dev kits out in the world and a consumer release coming soon. Valve has already added compatibility with the Rift for Half-Life 2 and TF2, and I was wondering if this compatibility could be applied to Black Mesa. If not officially added by the devs, could it be modded in? It seems like it wouldn&#39;t be too hard, if the engine already has the features enabled... But, as usual, I&#39;m probably very wrong.</description>

<p>Well, looking at your avatar, I’d say you’d want a holodeck-like experience, and I would love that kind of experience too! So I do understand… maybe I need to get out of the whole ‘sit down while playing games’ mindset.</p>

            <p>Allow me to complete the VR setup, and explain why you’d want full body tracking. The Virtuix Omni, if you hadn’t heard of it, is basically a 360 degree treadmill that, paired with a rift and controllers such as the STEM, (although a normal gamepad can be used as well) allows you to physically move and run around in an FPS game. If you put all these things together with the BM/HL2/EPS VR mod, it could be the greatest virtual reality experience ever. I would love to buy them all, but it’ll be about a thousand dollars for the full set, and I’d want heavy duty headphones too. This Omni also isn’t perfect, but it’ll be the best thing availible to the consumer for a while. But these companies, Oculus, Sixense, and Virtuix are all working together, holding hands, jacking each other off. I’m very glad about that, because in order for VR to work properly, people need to work together on this.</p>
<p>Really looking forward to 2026, when I can transport myself into the game TRON-style. Until then, looks like Rift/STEM/Omni is the best setup for physically running and jumping around Black Mesa, and being Gordon rather than playing as him.</p>

            <p>You guys might want to wait until sixense, who made the hydra, release their next product the STEM. It is basically a wireless version of the hydra, with full body tracking support, force-feedback haptics and overall improvements.</p>

<p>I think he’s referring to when the source code is released. LOL.</p>
<p>However, I hope he does BM as well. I know I’ll be getting a consumer Rift, should it not flop. And if this mod goes well enough, I may pick up a hydra, or something similar.</p>

<p>I like the Half-life VR mod here. The developer says that he would love to add support for Black Mesa when it is released.</p>
<p>In this mod, you use motion controllers like the Razer Sixense Hydra or the upcoming Sixense STEM system, and you have complete motion control over the gun. The HUD is integrated into the game. Weapon information like ammo is on the left side of the gun, while health information is on the back of Gordon’s right hand.</p>

            <p>I’d just like it so the head tracking wasn’t tied to a specific mouse position! Turning my head even slightly causes the entire frame to move way too quickly, and there are mouse acceleration issues too. Oh and the FOV is wrong as well. Everything is zoomed in too much, even after tweaking that in the video settings.</p>
<p>As I said, if I knew how, I’d fix these things myself… haha</p>
<p>I guess we will just wait until the code is released, or someone with more know how figures out how to integrate VR correctly in BM.</p>

            <p>This is really IMHO, but I really do believe that out of all the HL-universe games released, Black Mesa ‘feels’ more like what the original HL was trying to accomplish than any other. Being full immersed into that experience is something I’d be very interested in.</p>
<p>Imagine walking into Blast Pit with a full HD Oculus Rift on your face! Seeing the huge rooms!</p>
<p>I really do hope that this is developed further somehow… if I had the know-how, I would do it myself really.</p>

        <title>Black Mesa in VR?</title>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Going to slightly hijack this thread… I’ve used my Oculus Rift on Black Mesa using the Perception driver and it works mostly. Weird things with mouse control and the fact that turning my head even to the side seems to spin the player view completely around, but it’s playable at least.</p>

<p>Nein, he never specified that. That’s just speculation. He just said if you’re making a mod that uses BM as a base to email him. But yeah, the thread has since been removed.</p>

<p>Still no clue what you’re talking about  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I would never make a public thread asking for code. Mark doesn’t distribute the code either, we have a version control system for that.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@FEAR</span> I’m pretty sure someone will make something decent in the future then.Though I have my doubts since BM Co-Op on Facepunch is already in development for almost 1 year, and they probably just start updating less step by step and eventually just forget about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnM7SbjxSTE" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">It has already been done.</a>You can do this with the free 3D driver called <a href="https://www.vireio.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">“Vireio”</a>.<br>
To bad I’m way too broke to even purchase a Oculus Rift.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, that’s the driver people use to play unsupported games. However, I’ve heard that this causes motion sickness, warping, and FOV issues, and is overall not a great long-term solution.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fePj2XG0IW8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Have a look at this.</a> It’s Half-life 2 with the Rift. The player is actually able to move the camera view with his head, and the reticule with his mouse, separately. Without this integration, your head moves your entire arm and gun along with it, and the center of your vision is the only place you can shoot. All I am wondering is if the exact same Rift support from HL2 can be copy-pasted (loosely) into BM.</p>
