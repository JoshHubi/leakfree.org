            <p>yeah ok but that’s mostly casual let’s-get-together-and-play-some-board-games-type games/atmosphere, as far as im aware</p>
<p>most of the gaming business revolves around playing games by yourself (multiplayer through internet or single player)<br>
you know, the type of gamer who just comes home, turns on his computer, and then settles in for some deeply relaxing vidya games after a long day.</p>

            <p>A developer actually made a tower defense game using a occulus rift. It really does help immersion, as you can look around your castle from up above, and view that battle. Right here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/2/4685556/creator-of-oculus-rift-cover-based-shooter-whips-up-a-tower-defense" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/2/4685556/creator-of-oculus-rift-cover-based-shooter-whips-up-a-tower-defense</a></p>
<p>I do think that Oculus rift is the future of gaming. At least I hope it is.</p>

<p>Valve implemented 7 different control schemes for TF2.<br>
This is the beginning, a Wolfenstein 3D kind of an era, which had a terrible mouse support and it took years to get the proper mouselook (Quake I) that became the industry standard for FPP games.<br>
As Carmack said (about VR): “everyone working today is a pioneer. The paradigms that everyone will take for granted in the future are being figured out today.”</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In Valve’s native support the gun is only kinda tied to the head movement. Here is a quick example: <a href="https://youtu.be/PNcPWeAHAYI?t=1m31s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/PNcPWeAHAYI?t=1m31s</a></p>
<p>In Andrew &amp; WormSlayer’s HL2VR mod the weapon tracking is handled by your Hydras (or STEM Controllers in the future): <a href="https://youtu.be/FJpg1ficCxI?t=4m36s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/FJpg1ficCxI?t=4m36s</a></p>
<p>emart says that while the Hydras make for a more immersive experience, it is much easier for him to aim and hit targets with the mouse.<br>
Palmer Luckey has talked about the kb&amp;m being “super-human” input devices on numerous occasions - this is what emart is talking about.</p>

            <p>Modsception - so shall it be. (Hopefully!)</p>
<p>This raises a point about the flashlight though (thank you for posting the video by Nathan Andrews Bloodshot.)<br>
Should it not (ideally) be modeled as a weapon so that you can shine the light irrespective of your view? In other words, aiming with the flashlight.<br>
I’m nit-picking I know and I don’t care about it that much, but the idea just popped into my cranium.</p>
<p>Also! Super optimistic about the possibility of integration with the announcement of the pending commercial release.</p>

            <p>Some of the devs want BM to be open source in some fashion so that modding* can take place.  BMVR would be awesome.  Add the HUD to the gun or perhaps a popup display on the arm of the HEV suit if you press a button.  Who knows!</p>

            <p>I would buy an Oculus Rift and a hydra just to play BM with that VR mod.</p>
<p>Actually, I’ll probably buy it just to play HL2 with it. Being able to lean around corners with your actual body and the capability to inspect the weapons you have with your actual hands seems pretty cool.</p>

<p>I have one believer yeah! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Once I get my VR gear the first thing I’m playing is Titans of Space (a promise I need to keep) the very next game will be BM followed by the HL series. I just hope that BM works with the creators of this mod and that Xen comes out before June next year.</p>
<p>Also, this is an awesome channel to watch a playthrough of the mod from the eyes of someone who’s never played Half Life before:</p>

            <p>So Reverend Kyle recently did a <a href="https://www.reverendkyle.com/index.php/articles/216-rev-vr-podcast-episode-20" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">podcast interview</a> with <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/road-to-vr-rev-vr-podcast-episode-20/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Road to VR</a>’s founder Ben Lang.<br>
To get a better idea of what Nathan Andrews and WormSlayer’s HL2VR 1.2 mod is like listen from 25:21 to 31:20 (the core segment is from 27:41 to 29:22.)</p>
<p>Let me reiterate, this is not a rehashing of Valve’s HL2 Rift support, and the developers are very interested in working with the BM Dev Team.</p>

<p>I’m aware of that, if you look at the video ( <a href="https://youtu.be/MH3v2VrCZ9Q" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/MH3v2VrCZ9Q</a> )  though you’ll notice that the UI has been completely redesigned and weapon animations now follow input from motion devices - the weapon is not locked to your view.</p>
<p>This is new. Additionally their mod is still in beta, and they plan on adding a full body HEV suit for the character model so that you’re not just a pair of floating hands.</p>
<p>The article really is well worth the read, and seeing as WormSlayer states they’d be happy to work with the BM dev team on integrating their mod with BM I thought that was noteworthy and something to get excited about. I wouldn’t bother posting something on this site if I thought it was old news or useless.<br>
