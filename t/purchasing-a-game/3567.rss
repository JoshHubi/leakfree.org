    <title>Purchasing a game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/purchasing-a-game/3567</link>
    <description>So I have a little problem. I&#39;ve wanted to Garry&#39;s Mod 10 for a long time now but is a bit problematic. The game is only available in Steam so I can&#39;t buy it in stores. I don&#39;t have a credit card myself and my parents won&#39;t let me use theirs. I only have silly debit card that&#39;s made for younger people which I can&#39;t use to pay things on-line. Does anybody have any alternate suggestions? I would greatly appreciate it.</description>

<p>Best solution; don’t buy Gmod, not worth the money. Stupid game. If you wanna make something, make something useful in hammer editor.</p>
<p>Instead, give a friend some money and have been a real game for you, like HL Anthology or HL2. And if you really wanted to, you can trust Wheybags and mail him some money, but finding a friend is a lot easier. And if he doesn’t hold up his end of the deal we can all flame him.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>VISA Gift Cards are limited to the US only, though they can be used in Europe (just can’t purchase them over here).</p>
<p>Anyway, I try to never use my VISA, unless there’s no other option, and the thing I often do for online payments, is use Paypal that -isn’t- tied to my VISA, but instead uses the prepaid principle. I just wire money from my account to the Paypal account (the amount I need to pay) and pay for Steam games (and pretty much everything I buy online) that way.</p>
<p>Sure, it might take 2-3 days for the money to get onto the Paypal account, but it’s not like you purchase really urgent things on the internet anyway.</p>

<p>EDIT: Ninja’d by a few seconds.</p>
<p>The while probably not the easiest solution, it is effective. Go to the store and buy  a Simon Gift card. Its a Visa gift card that works like a non-reloadable Visa Credit card. Have the cashier or whoever load the card with the desired amount of money. Once the card is activated, you can used it just like a normal credit card in stores. To purchase things online you’ll need to go to the card’s website and register the gift card under your name. Then proceed to steam and purchase Gmod just like you would with a normal credit card. Then proceed to trash the card as it can never be re-loaded with cash, and its now out of money.</p>

            <p>Go to a CVS or a convenience store with your debit card. Use said debit card to buy a $15 VISA gift card. Use said gift card to buy games on steam. Bam.</p>

            <p>So I have a little problem. I’ve wanted to Garry’s Mod 10 for a long time now but is a bit problematic. The game is only available in Steam so I can’t buy it in stores. I don’t have a credit card myself and my parents won’t let me use theirs. I only have silly debit card that’s made for younger people which I can’t use to pay things on-line. Does anybody have any alternate suggestions? I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
