    <description>That would be pretty twisted and ironic. When time is frozen at the end Gordon Freeman powerless before the might of the mysterious G-Man is whisked away yet again while Alyx is left to die in the reactor blast. Instead of a heroes death he deserved, he was again teleported stripped of his weapons to an unknown location where(after the credits) a headcrab drops down and finishes him off. There was no choice this time for Gordon like after Xen in the first game, G-Man didn&#39;t need his services anymore so death was inevitable he knew too much. The irony that he met his end not at the hands of the powerful foes he encountered but from a simple headcrab that he and his crowbar could easily of take care of.</description>

<p>The first Half-Life movie treatment pitched to us climaxed with a tearful reunion between enslaved Vortigaunts and their Vortiwives and children. The last one I saw had Black Mesa invaded by a cavalry unit, just so as to feature a scene of bullsquids tearing into armoured horses… Which I admit is sort of cool, but has nothing to do with Half-Life.</p>

<p>Thanks, that was useful. Looks like they got the story under control then. (Although it is interesting to hear that they are indeed making the story up as they go along, effectively. But they do seem to take it very seriously.)</p>

            <p>I have a feeling that the creators of <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span> have somehow written themselves into a corner and don’t really know themselves how the entire story can be tied up and ultimately make sense.</p>
<p>I mean, the action and the plot on the face of it are all fine and well. But the “deeper” aspects of the story, like the GMan, just don’t add up. First he’s supposed to <span class="bbcode-i">want</span> to initiate the resonance cascade and to conquer Xen (that much is said in HL1 and HL2.2). But then he also wants Adrien Sheperd to stick around (why?), but then actually he also wants to blow Black Mesa up (as he does, ultimately). Then he wants to let Alyx die in the blast, and only the intervention of the Vortigaunts, plainly against his will, save her. But then he actually was the one who rescued her from the RC in the first place and he wants Gordon to continue protecting her. So… what the hell does he want?</p>
<p>There’s only so much “mystery” you can have in a story before it becomes a massive nonsensery. I was willing to believe that there was a bigger story for the first game or two, but if you just keep on making more games that never explain anything and only add more mystery, then I’m beginning to think that <span class="bbcode-i">nobody</span> really has a plan. Sure, there’ll always be people who will defend any kind of obscurity as “awesome”, but on my part, I do at some point want to see a hint or two that there is actually something bigger going on, and not just more bizarre “clues” that don’t amount to anything.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, I’m under the impression that Valve may be thinking along similar lines, and that Episode Three will, for better or worse, have to bring about some amount of closure and conclusion. Imagine how frustrating it would be if all those loose ends were <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> tied up: Suddenly all the past games would retroactively crumble as pointless nonsense (story-wise, that is). So the burden on the next episode is huge.</p>
<p>And I think nobody has a clue how to handle it in a satisfying way.</p>

            <p>i agree. hl1 and hl2 were great. ep 1 and 2, something about them, just broke the pattern. but, as much as i’m glad they’re making hl3 a larger game instead of a small ep3, i wish they’d make ep 3 then hl3, so that the episodes can act as one large game altogether.</p>

            <p>I agree G-man should be one of the last mysteries resolved in the series he’s a compelling character. I dunno but imo I thought ep1 &amp; ep2 weren’t up to the same quality standards of hl2. Sometimes I wonder if gabe at the end of production of ep2 was like “shit…what have we made scrap ep3 plz” and has been dancing around the subject of another half life ever since with portal 2/CS:GO/tf2 hats to keep us distracted until they can fine tune the next one to perfection.</p>

            <p>there will always be cliffhangers of some sort in half life games, therfore the series is forever bound to valve;<br>
it will just take a long time to make thats all</p>
<p>even if half life 3 ends the story arc, hopfully it wont be the end of the series<br>
(but i hope valve doesnt destroy half life’s biggest mysteries, because i feel gman’s mystery should stretch out for say half life 4 or 5)</p>
<p>unless valve will pull off a new one and make yet another array of mysteries in the series (that are equally as gripping as the current)</p>

            <p>Oh yeah I know but Im just saying if ep1 and ep2 were never released. I know a lot of fans would be like wtf there’s gotta be more there’s plot points unresolved etc. but not every mystery needs to be resolved in movies/games. Sometimes your imagination on certain things is even better than what the creators themselves can come up with down the road. But I admit that kind of ending would be kinda anticlimactic lol.</p>
