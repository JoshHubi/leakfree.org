    <title>Interesting find on SteamDB (possible Black Mesa build)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/interesting-find-on-steamdb-possible-black-mesa-build/13723</link>
    <description>On the SteamDB website, which pulls data from valve&#39;s steam API, there&#39;s an unpublished app with an id of [url=&#39;https://steamdb.info/app/221140/subs/&#39;]221140[/url]. The app has been updated quite frequently recently, and was last known under the name &quot;Black Mesa&quot;. While this is cool in of itself, what&#39;s even more interesting is that occasionally someone is registered as in-app. Is this the Black Mesa steam build in development, or is it just a REALLY weird coincidence?

I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s interesting to say the least.  ^^</description>

            <p>If you are playing an unreleased app on Steam, it does not tell your friends or anyone else who does not have that game what you are playing. Only people who have the unreleased app can see that you are playing it. It just says “In-Game” for everyone else. Clever system from Steam. We have to make no efforts to hide it, and we wouldn’t need to either. It’s no secret we’re developing and working on the game, every day!</p>

            <p>I actually answered my question about the in-game thing. I snooped around the dev group and found a member who was just “in-game”. No game title or anything, just “Currently in-game” instead of “Currently in-game (game title here)”. I guess steam just doesn’t have a title programmed in yet.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>The solution to that is to not be friends with tools. But if they are, they probably get that just for being a known developer, rather than just showcasing that they’re currently running the game.</p>
<p>There was actually a time when we had Steam profile widgets, and you could see one of the mods in-game [sub][/sub]  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>One question I’ve been wondering, do you guys have to make sure that people don’t see you playing? For example, it’d be kind of odd if a friend of mine was seen playing “Half Life 3 : Beta”.</p>
<p>I’d imagine steam would keep this kind of thing hidden to the end-user, but I do find it interesting that SteamDB can still find out someone is in-app anyway.</p>
