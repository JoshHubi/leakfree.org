    <title>What game is this?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-game-is-this/12410</link>
    <description>I remember when I was very very young I used to play a weird first person game. I remember a training part of the game I constantly played because I was so bad at the campaign and or the multiplayer. It was sort of like Hazard Course in Half-Life except it was outside in some kind of camp.

Pretty damn big camp and the thing I remember best is jumping over and ducking under some huge tree logs. The area was pretty damn dark because it was in the middle of the night in game and I think it was raining as well.

The cover was some red symbol that looked as if someone had taken it into photoshop, put a white layer above and then lowered the opacity of the white layer to 50%.

Detailed it the best I could. Can anyone help?</description>

</aside>
<p>It can be played in first- or third-person, there’s also an overhead “tactical map” view. Almost always used first person, myself.</p>
<p>The training camp in H&amp;D 2 has trees around it but doesn’t really look much like a giant forest.</p>

            <p>Hidden &amp; Dangerous 2 is a third-person game while the one I thought about was first-person. And Brothers in Arms is way too graphically advanced to be it, I was playing this in like 2001 I think?</p>
<p>It might be Project I.G.I. but I’m not too sure, I’ll have to try it and get back to you.</p>
<p>EDIT: Maybe it’ll help a bit more if I told you that the camp was situated in a giant forest? Hence the logs ‘n’ all that.</p>

            <p>Possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_I.G.I.:_I%27m_Going_In" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Project I.G.I.: I’m Going In</a>?</p>
<p>The only game I’ve played (that I can think of) that has a training mission in a big camp in the rain is Hidden &amp; Dangerous 2, but that’s not at night and the cover doesn’t look like what you described. Hmm.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some of the Brothers in Arms games start in the dark while it’s raining, the tutorials make you jump over and crouch under some fallen trees…</p>

<p>I don’t think it can be Delta Force, because Delta Force’s symbol is blue on a red background, while I talked about a completely red symbol on a white background.</p>

<p>Whoops, was thinking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Force:_Urban_Warfare" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">a different Delta Force game</a> (doesn’t really fit either) and didn’t look at the wiki page I linked to properly  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Do you know the platform of the game and what year (roughly) you played it?</p>
