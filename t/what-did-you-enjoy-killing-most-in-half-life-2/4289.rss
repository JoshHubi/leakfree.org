    <title>What did you enjoy killing most in Half-Life 2?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-did-you-enjoy-killing-most-in-half-life-2/4289</link>
    <description>the thing i enjoyed killing most were the metro police. I used to open the console and enter impulse 101, just so i could shoot them before they would shove a stun stick up your ass. The npc i hated the most in half-life 2 was the combine, i got really tired of killing just them after a while. what do you think?</description>

            <p>Half-Life 2 was never terribly strong in the action department, save for a few parts.  I always found the weapons to be relatively lacking, they just weren’t that fun to use, and the enemies were similarly unremarkable.  You were still fighting enemies that were generally humans and had human or human-like weaponry.  Any monsters you fought were also relatively simple, save for the striders and bigger enemies that generated a lot of action.</p>
<p>The fact that they added no new weapons, and pretty much no new enemies across episodes didn’t help.  Half-Life 1 was somewhat more interesting, though still wasn’t as fun as some of its mods that made things more amusing.  Half-Life 2’s strength lies in its flow and story-telling, which it excels at greatly.</p>
<p>Still, I’ll be greatly disappointed if there’s no new weapons in Episode 3, and only the advisors as a new enemy.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as hell. I just didn’t enjoy Half Life 2 the way I enjoyed Half Life. It was to boring, especially the city part, or parts where you were against combines. It fells better to be in an undiscoverd border dimension then a generic city.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I kinda agree. I really enjoy Half-Life 2 up to Nova Prospekt, and then for some reason the environments just sort of blur together into a big grey blob.</p>
<p>My favorite thing to kill has to be the manhacks. I like the “smash” noise they make when you propel them against a wall with the gravity gun. :3</p>
