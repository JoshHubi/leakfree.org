    <title>What a Remake</title>

    <description>Moin.

At the day Half Life came out in germany i bought it and i wasn´t disappointed about its AI and the complete game, too.
I bought only for Half Life a new diplaycard to play on the highest Gfx level.
A short period of time later, i think two weeks or so, the game was banned from the german market. The violence level was to high. You now, censorship, the youth and so on, but i had the original version.
Then came Blue Shift and the other episode where you play a soldier.
The third episode came only as censored version. No gore, the faces was exchanged by a gasmask. It´s foolish but it was Half Life and i must have it.
Half Life and Blue Shift had the same changes after the relaunch in germany.
All three games captivated me and i played them many times.
Then i heard Half Life, sorry, Black Mesa was out.
I read about it in a serious hardwaremagazine.
What a great relaunch for a game that changed the AI in first person shooters for ever.
Here in germany we say ganz grosses kino. That means the Crew around Black Mesa can be proud of what they done.
Is there a chance for Blue Shift and the soldier episode in this century?  :slight_smile: 
No, it was a joke, but question costs nothing.</description>
