    <title>Reversing stereo for headphones</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/reversing-stereo-for-headphones/11128</link>
    <description>I recently bought some new headphones after my old ones died and they work fine except for one problem. The stereo is reversed so the left plays on the right and vice versa. This is annoying in games because I&#39;m constantly dying because I turn the wrong way.
I was wondering if anyone knows of a program or something that is capable of reversing the stereo of all sounds on my pc, so as to revert the sound to proper stereo. If there is no possible software based fix then I&#39;ll just have to solder some wires together in the cable. (by the way the headphones can&#39;t really be put on other way around)</description>

            <p>Just read this:<br>
“there was an application (Final Fantasy Eight) which was making the audio reverse. I thought it only did it in-game, but apparently it did a permanent change. I checked off reverse stereo in the FF8 settings, and now everything is fine.”</p>
<p>You might want to check other aps/games you’re running and see if the same thing happened to you.</p>
<p>Also, this:<br>
“If they headphones/speakers aren’t usb it’s easy enough to cross wire it, even without soldering. If you don’t want to solder, just get an 1/8” jack (male) to RCA (male) adapter and an 1/8" jack (female) to RCA (female) adapter. Cross the RCA jacks and that’s it."</p>

            <p>Most headphones have fairly accessible solder pads that connect to cable. A less invasive method would be to use a few adapters that go from 3.5mm to RCA back to 3.5mm. You could then swap channels.</p>
<p>Also this is a shot in the dark but the program virtual audio cable may be able to do it but I can’t test it as I’m on my phone.</p>

<p>EDIT: nope virtual audio cable cant do it. Think your stuck with a hardware solution.</p>

<p>Bad cans? Why are they backward in the first place?</p>
<p>Anyway…  Your best bet is either by a physical switching adapter or resoldering the connections (or make your own adapter, preserving the original wiring). Unless you can find software solutions in the individual programs you’re using.  I think VLC supports swapping and so do some games… but that sounds like a PITA, if you ask me…</p>
<p>As for the non-reversibility of your headgear: that’s a big gripe I’ve had with every pair of headphones I’ve owned - you throw them on in a hurry and they’re ALWAYS ON BACKWARDS… So I have to ask: How are yours not reversible?</p>

<p>Well, the microphone for some dumb reason doesn’t turn a full 360 degrees and thus can only be oriented towards one side of the headset. In addition, the cable would be going across me to my pc which would possibly be annyoing</p>
