The &quot;Steam Box&quot; modular computer announced by hardware maker Xi3 and Valve at CES is codenamed &quot;Piston&quot; and is modeled after the PC maker&#39;s X7A line of pint-sized computers, Xi3 reps tell Polygon.

Xi3 brought an early version of Piston to CES, but was tight lipped on details about the hardware currently in development with Valve. Xi3 chief marketing officer David Politis told Polygon that Piston will offer up to 1 TB of interal storage and offer modular component updates, including the option to upgrade the PC&#39;s CPU and RAM.

Xi3 wouldn&#39;t discuss price for Piston, but commented that the Steam Box is based on its &quot;performance level&quot; X7A offering, which is priced at $999. Xi3 declined to comment on what would differentiate Piston hardware-wise from a standard X7A.

It probably won&#39;t cost $1000 but I can&#39;t see it being too much lower. I really don&#39;t know who this is for. PC people already have their PCs and I can&#39;t see people who play on consoles going anywhere near this thing.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>To summarize everything a little bit and to clear some things out about Valves’s BigFoot project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are using steam and/or already playing games on your computer<br>
then you <span class="bbcode-b">don’t</span> need it. You are <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> the target audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s not a console.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That means it will be more expensive,<br>
because hardware developers usually make revenue loss (Xbox 360 and PS3)<br>
but it gets compensated with the higher game prices.<br>
PC prices stay the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is the target audience, that Valve is aiming for?<br>
It’s not you. Why? Because they already won you as a customer,<br>
if you use Steam on your PC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to question yourself what the biggest advantages<br>
of the consoles are. They are easy to use. They only need to<br>
put the DVD in and can start the game. That’s how Nintendo,<br>
Sony and Microsoft have won so many people for their<br>
gaming consoles although those people probably never played any games before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the target audience. People who barely played games,<br>
who never used Steam. It’s a try to make the PCs more attractive<br>
and to “compete with the gaming consoles” like Gabe Newell has said in an interview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valve is going to try to convince other game developers to port their<br>
games to Linux. They don’t know if they will be successful with all of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There won’t be any exclusive titles. Valves goal is to make every<br>
game able to play where the internet works. Of course those games<br>
need to work on the specific hardware. This also means you can play<br>
all games on your account, if the requirements are met.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll be able to install Windows on it, if you don’t like Linux.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>Thread title can now be changed.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>With the first of many “Steam Box” computers making its debut at CES, Valve boss Gabe Newell has really opened up to The Verge about his company’s hardware plans, revealing that the range of gaming PCs might be even more ambitious than we would have imagined.<br>
Some of the main things he touches on:</p>
<p>• Valve’s own Steam Box (Gabe actually refers to it as this) will be sold by Valve and will run Linux, though you can install Windows on it if you want. “This is not some locked box by any stretch of the imagination”, he says.</p>
<p>• The controller shipping with Valve’s Steam Box won’t use motion, but as expected, they will probably use some kind of biometric feedback. “Maybe the motion stuff is just failure of imagination on our part, but we’re a lot more excited about biometrics as an input method.” He also mentions gaze-tracking as being “super important”.</p>
<p>• Valve wants you to make your own Steam stores. “Some people will create team stores, some people will creates Sony stores, some people will create stores with only games that they think meet their quality bar. Somebody is going to create a store that says ‘these are the worst games on Steam.’ So that’s an example of where our thinking is leading us right now.”</p>
<p>• The Steam Box - code-named “Bigfoot” at Valve - won’t just be a PC. It’ll be a server, too, with the near future enabling you to “have one PC and eight televisions and eight controllers and everybody getting great performance out of it”. The LAN party just made a comeback. Only without all the cables.</p>
<p>There’s way, way more stuff - all of it interesting reading - in the full interview.</p>

<p>Reached for comment this morning about the forthcoming piece of hardware, Valve marketing director Doug Lombardi told Polygon that Piston is just one of many hardware prototypes they brought to the show.</p>
<p>“Valve will be at CES to meet with hardware and content developers in our booth space,” Lombardi said. “We are bringing multiple custom (hardware) prototypes as well as some off-the-shelf PCs to our CES meetings.”</p>
<p>Lombardi described the prototypes as "low-cost, high-performance designs for the living room that are great candidates for Steam and Big Picture.</p>

            <p>Honest to god I hope that this is not the alleged Steambox as this thing is dead on arrival(if they are hoping for a commercial success which I am assuming they are)if it’s anywhere near that price range…no scratch that if it’s anywhere near 700 $.I already own a modular gaming platform that I can hook up to my TV and it’s called My fucking PC…no,seriously,that’s the name of my computer.</p>

            <p>The people who would go for it are people who need to upgrade their computers but don’t want to bother buying tons of new equipment and want to use existing home theater systems for visuals and sound, and rely on their Steam cloud for games instead of installing via optical media, most likely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The “Steam Box” modular computer announced by hardware maker Xi3 and Valve at CES is codenamed “Piston” and is modeled after the PC maker’s X7A line of pint-sized computers, Xi3 reps tell Polygon.</p>
<p>Xi3 brought an early version of Piston to CES, but was tight lipped on details about the hardware currently in development with Valve. Xi3 chief marketing officer David Politis told Polygon that Piston will offer up to 1 TB of interal storage and offer modular component updates, including the option to upgrade the PC’s CPU and RAM.</p>
<p>Xi3 wouldn’t discuss price for Piston, but commented that the Steam Box is based on its “performance level” X7A offering, which is priced at $999. Xi3 declined to comment on what would differentiate Piston hardware-wise from a standard X7A.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It probably won’t cost $1000 but I can’t see it being too much lower. I really don’t know who this is for. PC people already have their PCs and I can’t see people who play on consoles going anywhere near this thing.</p>
