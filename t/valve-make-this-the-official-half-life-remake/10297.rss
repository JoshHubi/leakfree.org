    <description>Valve need to contact these to make this official. When Xen is finished it should be ported over to the 2009 engine and given a full retail release. The devs deserve to be paid for years of dedication. How these guys aren&#39;t working for Valve already is beyond me.</description>

<p>Unless there’s a plan to put all sorts of work towards actually <em>using</em> those new Source engine features, it wouldn’t be very useful to upgrade. It would be cool for the game to get some major blessing from Valve, though. I’m sure they’ll do something. I, for one, would love to see commentary nodes, with lots of commentary contributed by the original Half-Life team. That could be very interesting  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Wow imagine that?<br>
Like the original teams take on BM, what they thought and what they like and references to the original. Would be awesome but one of those things that probably would never happen <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Multicore rendering would dramatically increase performance. Plus all the extra graphical effects would make this shiny game even shinier. A petition should be set up to make Valve aware, but I sure busy playing playing this with there mouths gaping.</p>

            <p>It’s probably not going to happen, but if Valve did release the 2009 source code, I’d like to see BM ported to it so the game can take advantage of multi-core rendering and native Mac support. Then I could run it maxed out with a much better framerate than the 30fps average I’ve been getting. BM porting to 09 could take longer, but considering the many members with multicore computers and Macs, it’s worth it.</p>
<p>Everyone, petition Valve to release the '09 sources!</p>

            <p>What I really want to know/see is Gabe/Marc/Valves thought on BM. In my mind I imagined Gabe sitting there watching the timer on the 14th before it hit zero in his office <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I’d love to have seen Gabe or Marc’s face and experience when playing out BM, I can only assume they must have checked it out or are going to.</p>

<p>But the devs don’t want to sell it. I’m pretty sure they’ve said this enough. also, porting it to the new engine might take a while, since I’m pretty sure some code would have to be rewritten.</p>
