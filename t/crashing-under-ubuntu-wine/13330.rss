    <title>Crashing under Ubuntu/Wine</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crashing-under-ubuntu-wine/13330</link>
    <description>Hello!
I&#39;ve installed Black Mesa along with the Windows version of Steam and the Source SDK on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine. Steam and the SDK work fine, but Black Mesa tends to crash at random, especially during loadpoints and usually followed by audio and video stuttering. It&#39;s getting to the point where the game is almost unplayable.

My specs:
Intel i5 w/ 4000 HD Graphics
Ubuntu 14.04 AMD64
Wine 1.6.2
Steam 1401381906/1401381906

Thanks in advance,
John</description>
