    <description>My save games is ruined, everyone i load spawn my Freeman outside the world.


See picture. that i have attached.

It happens for all recent save games and the manual ones i have are so far back in the game that its close to not making me want to proceed.

Anyway to solve this ?

<p>Thanks, i can move now, but it seems I also lost all my weapons, I’ll have to look up the cheat codes to get somewhere, i know i had weapons there at some stage, oddly though I think i bypassed something somehow in a way I should have not, at least i never saw that hole in the roof near the place where i have to turn the electricity off and walk the mine fields.</p>
<p>And no btw i did’nt download anything.</p>
<p>however i wrote impulse 101 in console, and picked that alien weapon thing, and HL2.exe crashed. :/. (after i was thrown offworld and typed noclip and lost all my weapons)</p>
<p>EDIT 2. it seems everything is messed up, it wont show any of the weapon models and takes forever to load a new level. i alt+tabbed out and HL2.exe crashed again.</p>
<p>It seems the game is buggy as hell since HL2.exe has crashed many times as in not thoroughly tested before release. It looks like a repeatedble bug.</p>
<p>is there cache somewhere i can delete or something, i get a lot of red text when i type impulse 101 about this and that model not loading</p>
