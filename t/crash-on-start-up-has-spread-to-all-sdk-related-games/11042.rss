    <description>Hello,
I&#39;m pretty upset right now. I&#39;ve tried for hours to get this mod going on both this and last weekend. As my situation currently stands, I cannot run black mesa and I cannot run any other game that uses the sdk. 

Here is the process of my latest attempt:
I completely uninstalled ALL local content including the steam client. 
I downloaded black mesa and steam.
I proceeded to install half life 2.
Tested the installation of half life 2, still non-functional even after a complete wipe and reinstallation.
I verified the integrity of the installations of hl2, sdk 2006 and sdk 2007 and they all came back 100% positive.
I will attempt to install the mod and try it anyway, though I&#39;m positive it won&#39;t work. 
UPDATE: It didn&#39;t. :*(

Specs:
win7 home premium x64 sp1
i7-2630QM
GTX 570m with updated drivers

I would at least love to get my original games working again. I have no idea why this would affect all my other games even after a wipe and reinstallation. Anything you can do would be much appreciated.</description>

<p>Don’t misinterpret this, as I do empathise with you, but it doesn’t sound like BMS caused the SDK to mess up or you other games, all the installer does is install bms correctly, it doest change anything to do with the SDK, or other HL games, in just creates the BMS folder and uncompresses files to it. it sounds like there is something wrong though for other games to not work,<a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12513" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">maybe you should upload the minidump as requested in the stickies within the bug section</a> I would ensure all graphic drivers are up to date and maybe try to look for a fix on steam forums for the SDK/HL games.</p>

            <p>Windows is already updated with sp1, and I downloaded the sdk 2006 and 2007 files direct from steam so I have the latest editions of those as well. I have already wiped and redownloaded EVERYTHING involved short of my OS several times and it has yet to do anything. Thanks for the tips, but I’ve already tried them :*(</p>
<p>I will check out that FAQ however, I haven’t looked there yet.</p>

            <p>Did you install both, Source SDK Base 2006 and Source SDK Base 2007 and do you used backup discs for the SDK install?</p>
<p>You should upgrade your 7 with the official <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5842" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">SP1</span></a> from Microsoft if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>Then i would recommend you to completely re-download the full SDK Base 2006 and 2007 in Steam (Library -&gt; Tools).</p>
<p>And also check out the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Talk:Source_SDK_will_not_launch" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">Source SDK FAQ</span></a> from the Valve Dev Community, maybe you find a solution in it.</p>
