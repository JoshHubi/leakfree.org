    <title>[GLITCH] Falling through the train (On a Rail)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glitch-falling-through-the-train-on-a-rail/10311</link>
    <description>An interesting glitch occured. I had just gotten on the train and went through the ramp where a guard told me to find the rocket. I proceeded to the elevator and while moving, I did a quicksave. I exited, came back later and loaded the saved game. Everything was smooth until I accidentally tried to increase the train&#39;s throttle which is when the train appeared on the top of the elevator shaft (the elevator was still further down, descending) and I fell through, recieving a minor fracture.

            <p>i can confirm it exactly like po0zor said: loading a game, then entering the train makes it glitch.</p>
<p>i think everyone can figure out the workaround, but bugs need to be reported  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Yep, simply not using the train while the elevator’s moving does the trick.</p>
