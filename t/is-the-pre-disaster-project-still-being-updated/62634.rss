            <p>Me and Admiral Sakai are still kicking, just very slowly.</p>
<p>Sprocket said a while ago that he was focused on IRL stuff, I’m assuming that’s still the case.</p>
<p>ArcHammer and Magmatic I have no clue.<br>
If I had to guess, ArcHammer is tied up IRL, and Magmatic left the project.</p>
