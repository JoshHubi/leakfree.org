    <title>Multi-player mode Idea Thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multi-player-mode-idea-thread/12372</link>
    <description>I Just had an Idea for a Multi-player mode.

I&#39;ll call it protect the scientists for the sake of giving it a quick easy name.

One side play as Security Guards the other as HECU Marines.

The Scientists need to be guarded for a period of time and prevented from being killed by the HECU.

Scientists Man a number of computer stations before the Lambda Core (as seen in the last level we currently have in Black Mesa) Security Guards spawn in the armory.

Security Guards are limited to Shotguns and Pistols but there are also turrets before the area where the scientists are.

HECU have more resources to all weapons bar the tau cannon and the RPG.

The more scientists the security guards can keep alive a timer will go quicker to activate the teleportation machine. If you only have one scientist alive the timer will go slower to reach activation point of teleporter.

Once the teleport goal timer has been reached all security guards must reach the teleport and the HECU can still stop them. Sudden death will kick in at this point once the teleport goal is reached i.e. no re-spawn for either side.

The game will award points for each security guard and scientist (AI) teleported out of trouble. or if the HECU win Kills of scientists and security guards killed within sudden death. or any combination of.

What do you think?</description>

            <p>Lambda core where you meet the assasins would also make a good multi-player map<br>
Rocket Silo and Offices in OAR would also be ideal.</p>
<p>Sorry I feel like bumping this one…</p>
<p>Team deathmatch (Last man standing like counterstrike i.e. no respawn round based and classic deathmatch)</p>
<p>Security Guards vs Marines…</p>
<p>I think it would be epic…</p>
<p>Would a multi-player component be improved with a more varied selection of real life weapons too?</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong I like the sci-fi or alien weapons but It could make multi-player more varied and have a bit more realism in that sense…</p>
<p>Also to go one stage futher melee weapons SG’s have hand held Tasers and the marines combat knives…</p>
<p>Sorry not Tasers the correct term is stun gun… Like that in the video below… It would look weird SG’s all with crowbars</p>

<p>It would be like playing out the scenario of when the marines arrived.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Been playing quite a bit of Black Mesa recently and it occurred to me that some maps in particular in single player could be more or less ported straight over to deathmatch…</p>
<p>Here are some examples…</p>
<p>Inbound Menu Background map<br>
We got Hostiles (after the scientist is attacked by Marine)<br>
Surface Tension (Tank Yard with Underwater section and the pipes)<br>
Some of office complex (area with big canteen)<br>
A Modified Map of Power up could also work</p>

            <p>DM, TDM, and hopefully some CTF would be nice, but what if we had mutators to change play? For instance, adding “Portal Storm” to the game’s rules would have random Xen teleports bring in random enemy types to mix things up.</p>
<p>Round based no-respawn modes would be an interesting mutator, too.</p>

            <p>I totally get you scientists are AI if you are protecting them then your team are made of Security Guard “players only.”</p>
<p>It’s a bit counterstrike but not quite</p>
<p>Yeah perhaps it is a bit naff but I guess some new kind of mode would be good not essentially this idea.</p>
