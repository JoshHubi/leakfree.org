    <description>This isn&#39;t as much of a glitch as much as something that&#39;s been bothering me. On the tram ride, when you jump, you move backward (technically, you stay in place relative to the map, but whatever.) I&#39;ve seen staying in place when jumping on moving objects done in other source games. (not implying it&#39;s easy. It&#39;s probably 100x more difficult than I imagine. If it isn&#39;t worth developer resources &amp; time, ignore this)</description>
