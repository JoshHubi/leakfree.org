    <title>hr_nuke (CSGO) models and textures giving bad reflections</title>

    <description>[b]So, I tried getting some hr_nuke (new de_nuke remake = hr_nuke) props and textures into Black Mesa. Why? Because they&#39;re awesome![/size][/b]

But, here are the issues:[/size]

I think that image sumarizes it pretty well - reflections give purple-black checkers and I can&#39;t figure out why. Checking VMTs and all seems fine. My friend imported same stuff in Portal 2 an worked right out of the box. 

Now, I actually got hr_nuke&#39;s pipes to work:[/size]

[b]As you can see - no bad reflections. I believe the only thing I did was lower $envmapsaturation and $envmaptint values. But that doesn&#39;t seem to work for anything else.

[b]Aside from pipes, all foliage props work too.[/b][/size]</description>

            <p>CS:GO implemented a bunch of new cubemap features, and they also use a higher .mdl version number than ours. It’s highly likely that most CS:GO props will not work with our engine, unless decompiled/recompiled. Even then, it’s not likely. We had to do the same for Portal 2 props.</p>
