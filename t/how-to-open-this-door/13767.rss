    <title>How to open this door?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-open-this-door/13767</link>
    <description>If this is in the wrong place please move it.  The appropriate thread has been locked.

This is in the switch yard in On a Rail Uncut.  It is the building where the switch to open the door and switch rails is.  Now every where else in the game that I can think of if a door handle rattles when tried, then it can be opened later on.  But I have never figured out how to open this one and it is really bugging me.
So, can this door be opened?

            <p>Ayup!  He is also now on the BM team.  And it is also one of my favorite parts of the game and is much much much better than STU.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure you’re wrong about always being able to open doors with rattling handles. The rattling handles were a feature used in HL2 to explicitly signal doors you <span class="bbcode-i">couldn’t[\i] go through, but at least felt more realistic than simply a blank, non-interactive door texture.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The thing is though, according to the “visual vocabulary” that Valve built up with Half-Life games in Source, in general a door <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> be opened later on if the handle rattles, while a door that will <span class="bbcode-i">never </span>open is generally a door without a handle, to visually signal to the player that he/she should not waste time trying to open that door.</p>
<p>There are a few places in Black Mesa where the environments do not always follow the conventions put in place by Valve though.</p>

            <p>First, ensure that the Developer Console is enabled. To do this, go to the Options menu, click on the “Keyboard” tab, and then click the button labeled “Advanced.” Make sure the box next to “Enable Developer Console (<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">~</font>)” is checked.</p>
<p>Then, go into the game. When you are at the place you want to noclip, press the button above the tab key (should say <code> and [font='Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif']~[/font]). The game should pause and the console window will appear. To turn on noclip, type in "sv_cheats 1" (without the quotes) and press enter. This turns on "cheats." Then type in "noclip" and it should tell you "noclip ON". Press the console key (</code>/<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">~</font>) to return to the game. You now float through the world ignoring collisions and gravity, i.e. you can go anywhere you want, even through walls.</p>
<p>When you want to return to normal movement, return to the console (`/<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">~</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"></font>) and type in “noclip” again. It should tell you “noclip OFF”, and when you start playing again, you will walk normally.</p>

            <p>Ok I am now officially fixated on that door. There is most likely nothing behind it, making it the only door of that type that can not be opened in the game.  AFAIK.</p>
<p>So.  I have heard that there is something called “console” that can be used to enable something called “no clip” that lets one move through walls.  Are there instructions anywhere on how to use these items?</p>

            <p>Maybe you are correct and maybe you are not, but I can not think of another door that rattles that can not be opened.  I have recently played through BMS 3 times and specifically played that switchyard 3 times and I can not remember another door like that.</p>
