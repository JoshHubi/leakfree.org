    <description>They promised that when the game will be out on steam, there will be a free version, and a paid version, and they will be the same, so if you want to donate to them you will buy the paid version.
I waited for Black Mesa to come out on steam more than 2-3 years, I was really hyped for the Xen levels and the multiplayer and I thought I could play the game and enjoy it on release.
But guess what? No, I cannot enjoy the game. I opened steam and saw that Black Mesa is early access and costs 20 bucks. 20 bucks. 20 BUCKS FOR AN EARLY ACCESS GAME.

20 Bucks is not cheap here, you pay your water bill here with 30. Besides that, Early Access old school shooters dont survive for long (See a game called TOXIKK, a horrible UT3 knockoff and even its developers said that it is a knockoff of UT, its Early Access and after a month of its release it was already dead.) Anyway, after all of the development they still didnt finish the Xen levels which is pretty sad.

Avoid buying Black Mesa, because the developers are liars and make false promises.
Not that I can buy it anyway for that price lol.</description>

            <p>I’m going to close this thread as it’s devolved into shitposting and personal attacks. People on these forums are free to express their negative opinions about the game and what we’ve done with it. But there’s no need for personal attacks or anything that this thread has devolved into.</p>

            <p>What, exactly, are you trying to accomplish? I already pointed out that saying that the devs are liars about going retail isn’t even remotely true. All you’re doing is making an ass out of yourself.</p>

<p>Yes, of course. I meant just banning those who spam this around and are hurtful and abusive. Those who ask politely and wish to know should have their questions answered and should express their opinions, but as long as they’re being respectful.</p>

            <p>It’s like the people on welfare who gets hundreds of dollars to spend on food every month and then whine and cry about how the government treats them so terribly.<br>
I played around 90% of the mod version and then never got around to finishing the last bit, and the steam version is somewhere in the vicinity of 5-10 times better if you ask me. All this work put into updating the models, fixing map/script issues, texture work, balancing(skill.cfg op tho), Revolver that could possibly be used as porn, and everything else the devs have worked on for however long now, and people like the OP have the gall to bitch that the game isn’t free based on something the devs said years ago simply because they don’t want to/can’t spend 20 dollars on the best game I’ve played in a good while. And I don’t even really care about the multiplayer personally, at least with only deathmatch gamemodes.</p>

<p>20 Bucks is not cheap here, you pay your water bill here with 30.

            <p>I’d buy Black Mesa for $40. With mods, this will be a gift that keeps on giving. Also, that money allows them to have dedicated paid artists to speed up the whole process. I know it’s odd, this “getting paid for doing work” thing, I’m sure you’ll grasp it in time.</p>

            <p>Holy shit I have some sympathy for the devs. The aggressive whiny bastards have gotten worse than they ever have before. The devs came into this with no intention of charging for it and operated under that assumption for the vast majority of development. The opportunity to license BM came completely unexpected to them. They decided to take the opportunity and to charge. I personally respect that decision as it will hopefully allow them to make a better game and, honestly, they deserve the pay. For early access this game already has a lot of content and is relatively well polished. 20 dollars for a video game is not a lot relative to other games, I have sympathy that you claim to live in such an impoverished state but that really doesn’t mean you should be getting games cheaper than anywhere else. Anyway, for a one time purchase, even if you don’t have much money, 20 dollars is pretty damn small.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr: go away and show the devs some more respect</p>

            <p>Man, so many whiny people now that, you know, the Dev team put out something new and exciting. It seems like…like…so many people were whining before about inactivity…and now…they’re whining because it’s 20 bucks…hmmm…while…the links for the free, not so classy version, are still working. But…if 20 bucks is such a big deal then, a free version that is quite a damn good game still is suitable right, in place of it?</p>
<p>If you don’t like it, then…go away? Go play Half Life Source. Or Half Life. Leave the people who are actually grateful for the devotion of our Dev team to be happy, and leave the Dev team to complete the game and give us the best god damn remake of this decade.</p>
<p>You see, posting in every sub-forum about how things didn’t go YOUR way…it only makes you look childish and rude, like you’re throwing a tantrum because you feel “betrayed” by people who have stuck to their word.</p>

            <p>It’s unfortunate really. It really shows the true motivation behind the development team. For well over 8 years  people were lead to believe inspiration and fan loyalty were keeping the dream alive. I too will NOT pay one penny for the game.</p>
<p>At this point i don’t even care to play it. Why waste my time playing a false dream? In fact, i would like to offer advice. Perhaps you could all get a job working for EA games. They basically operate in the same regard. They promise the world, then proceed to lie to their fan base, followed by trying to sell what should be otherwise part of the initial game. Yep, don’t worry you’ll fit right in.</p>
<p>Luckily people without enough sense to know what’s right will help fill your greedy pockets.</p>

            <p>1)<span class="bbcode-b"> They never said the free version and paid version  would be the same.</span> They said <span class="bbcode-i">the exact opposite</span>: the free version is a mod on the freely available Source SDK, the paid version allows them to license a branch off the most up to date version of Source, and modify the engine code themselves, thus allowing them to do more to make a better game than could be possible in a mod.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>They have so far done exactly what they said: there is a free version, and a paid version. The free version is due to be updated to a newer version of the free Source engine shortly, although it will not then receive more updates except bug-fixes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also 20 BUCKS FOR AN EARLY ACCESS GAME is quite cheap compared to a very large number of EA games that are less complete than BM, so no idea why that deserved all-caps.</p>
