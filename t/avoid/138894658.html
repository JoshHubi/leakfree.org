I waited for Black Mesa to come out on steam more than 2-3 years, I was really hyped for the Xen levels and the multiplayer and I thought I could play the game and enjoy it on release.<br>
But guess what? No, I cannot enjoy the game. I opened steam and saw that Black Mesa is early access and costs 20 bucks. 20 bucks. 20 BUCKS FOR AN EARLY ACCESS GAME.</p>
<p>20 Bucks is not cheap here, you pay your water bill here with 30. Besides that, Early Access old school shooters dont survive for long (See a game called TOXIKK, a horrible UT3 knockoff and even its developers said that it is a knockoff of UT, its Early Access and after a month of its release it was already dead.) Anyway, after all of the development they still didnt finish the Xen levels which is pretty sad.</p>

<p>It’s unfortunate really. It really shows the true motivation behind the development team. For well over 8 years  people were lead to believe inspiration and fan loyalty were keeping the dream alive. I too will NOT pay one penny for the game.</p>
<p>At this point i don’t even care to play it. Why waste my time playing a false dream? In fact, i would like to offer advice. Perhaps you could all get a job working for EA games. They basically operate in the same regard. They promise the world, then proceed to lie to their fan base, followed by trying to sell what should be otherwise part of the initial game. Yep, don’t worry you’ll fit right in.</p>
<p>Luckily people without enough sense to know what’s right will help fill your greedy pockets.</p>

<p>Wow guys, there is so much butthurt here. do you have rough sand in ur sphincter? Maybe you need some lotion? or maybe you should stop eating spicy food if it causes you so much pain you little overly sensitive bum. Either way, if you don’t like anything here you don’t have to buy, download for free or play any of this awesome game/mod.  There is no such thing as Karma, fate or any of that other spirit/woo/hippie crap but there is personal choice. You should exercise it and leave. You  and your delicate holes will be the better for it</p>

<p>I bet you don’t even know what the thugee were.  And you need a concussion to complain about a game being worked on for a decade,  mostly for nothing other than the love of the game. Have you ever worked on a free mod for anything?  No, of course not. So how about you leave this forum,  go get some vagisil, treat the irritation you have between your legs and then think about why you feel you have the right to bitch like a spoiled child about the hard work other people have done.</p>

<p>Wow guys, there is so much butthurt here. do you have rough sand in ur sphincter? Maybe you need some lotion? or maybe you should stop eating spicy food if it causes you so much pain you little overly sensitive bum. Either way, if you don’t like anything here you don’t have to buy, download for free or play any of this awesome game/mod.

<p>Freeman"]They promised that when the game will be out on steam, there will be a free version, and a paid version, and they will be the same, so if you want to donate to them you will buy the paid version.<br>
I waited for Black Mesa to come out on steam more than 2-3 years, I was really hyped for the Xen levels and the multiplayer and I thought I could play the game and enjoy it on release.<br>
But guess what? No, I cannot enjoy the game. I opened steam and saw that Black Mesa is early access and costs 20 bucks. 20 bucks. 20 BUCKS FOR AN EARLY ACCESS GAME.</p>
<p>20 Bucks is not cheap here, you pay your water bill here with 30. Besides that, Early Access old school shooters dont survive for long (See a game called TOXIKK, a horrible UT3 knockoff and even its developers said that it is a knockoff of UT, its Early Access and after a month of its release it was already dead.) Anyway, after all of the development they still didnt finish the Xen levels which is pretty sad.</p>
<p>Avoid buying Black Mesa, because the developers are liars and make false promises.<br>
Not that I can buy it anyway for that price lol.</p>
