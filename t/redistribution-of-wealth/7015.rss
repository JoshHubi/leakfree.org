    <title>Redistribution of Wealth</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/redistribution-of-wealth/7015</link>
    <description>In the United States, the term &quot;redistribution of wealth&quot; is looked upon by many as a great evil, tantamount to Naziism.

In this thread, I&#39;d like to remove that kind of rhetoric from the discussion and discuss the idea of &quot;redistribution of wealth&quot;.  Why is it bad?  Can it be good?  Pros, cons?

What&#39;s your ideas on it?  Let&#39;s try to keep this civil, please.   :slight_smile:</description>

<p>They cannot sell a good or service without consumers and employees.  This island analogy is completely idiotic and does not represent the real world at all.</p>
<p>A business is in business to make money.  They provide an idea for a good or service and pay employees to make that good or conduct that service and sell it to consumers.  In return, that business makes a profit.  A very healthy profit.</p>

<p>Lol most companies don’t even hire dishwashers anymore, they buy a washing machine. You know why? Because the minimum wage laws make it cheaper for them to buy dishwashers rather then to hire a person. You just proved my point.</p>

</aside>
<p>And you completely miss the point.  They hire people because there’s a job that needs to be done.  And, no, they didn’t buy a machine to do it because of minimum wage laws.  Don’t be stupid.  A machine is there so that they don’t have to pay an employee at all.  Or train an employee.  Or give them time off for sickness (unless they break down).  They don’t need breaks.  They don’t have families.  THEY AREN’T HUMAN BEINGS.</p>

<p>Well hey, why don’t you make an example by giving all your income to the state.</p>

</aside>
<p>And this is a completely dumbass statement to make.  And you know it.</p>
<p>If you think murder or rape is wrong, then you can voluntarily give yourself over to the authorities and voluntarily stay in jail.  No.  We request a service from the government (I know you can’t get this through your thick skull) and we have to pay for that service.</p>
<p>To get something and not pay for it is theft.</p>

<p>then why the fuck are you being such a poster boy for bail-outs and government liabilities? Contradict yourself much.</p>

</aside>
<p>No contradiction.  You just don’t understand the subject.  Government bailouts help soften the blow to the economy when stupid people (such as yourself) create a recession by completely insane economic practices.</p>
<p>Oh you know this is true.  Don’t try to deny it.  If a business grows to a certain size and then fails, it takes the economy down with it.  We’ve already seen this happen with the subprime crisis.  Business fails and the economy suffers.  Open your eyes!</p>

<p>Honestly how old are you? You’re regurgitating a high school class lesson. The laws passed during the industrial revolution were done so after the markets had already weeded out the poor working conditions, etc. I’ll paraphrase a quote: “Government is the person who jumps in front of a parade and pretends to be leading it.”<br>
Sure, there were some fringe areas that still were not up-to-date with this concept and <span class="bbcode-i">were</span> positively affected by the laws passed; but it just doesn’t make pragmatic sense to put laws down on the books which are supposed to hold up to future conditions. Inefficiency is the word I’m looking for. In the long run, the laws tend to provide hindrances to progress and have a greater negative net effect.</p>

<p>I’m not denying the morality behind these programs, looking at it from such a point I would certainly agree those programs are for the good of the people.

These programs are by far the largest portion of government spending, and pretty much every nation is in debt. The US is the primary example of just how hard these liabilities have failed. Yes they are nice, no they are not sustainable. Again, the government creates absolutely no wealth. It’s the people that work that create the wealth.

            <p>And here we are in loops again. And the sad thing is, people like ODB and DSG get a negative view of capitalism / free markets because those of us (including myself) who are still babes in the philosophy are far too closedminded in our application.</p>
<p>I’m gonna address a couple things and go for now:<br>
The housing crisis was predicted a few years before anyone else saw it coming by the free market thinkers and some politicians like Ron Paul, citing the flawed economic policies which were (at the time, and still) contributing to it.</p>
<p>Now, Daniel, you are absolutely right that if we applied a pure free market system tomorrow, we’d all die (figuratively) because we are so dependent upon government assistance. But you need to realize that there are only so many bandaids you can put on a system before you need to revert to a better foundation.</p>
<p>I’m not wise enough to know how to get from where we are to where we need to be, but the solutions we are employing are only temporary and exasperating the problem in the long run.</p>
<p>No system is perfect, but I am so far convinced freer markets are better ones.</p>

<p>No that’s not silly, regulation does hurt less-skilled people. For example, because of minimum wage laws an employer might not consider to add another employee. Most people start at the bottom and work their way up, but if you force companies to pay a specific amount of money then they will think twice before hiring another person.</p>

<p>Wait, what?  WHY?  If they need someone to wash the dishes and they can’t pull anyone off to wash dishes because everyone else is currently busy doing other things, why would they not hire a dishwasher?</p>

<p>What complete utter bullshit, the government is a cancer to capitalism. It does nothing more than spend all the wealth created by the people.</p>

<p>What complete utter bullshit.</p>

<p>It takes money from one group of people and gives it to another (money redistribution). Just look at the amount of debt for crying out loud,</p>

</aside>
<p>Most of which was caused by government spending and tax cuts.  Seriously, you need to open your eyes, Jean.  You are so full of shit.</p>

<p>all the endless billions pouring into fancy government programs that I’m sure you love so much.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Horse.  Shit.  Don’t pull that crap on me.  These “fancy government programs” are something that we demanded the government create because we’re not as stupid as you are.  We know that these “fancy government programs” make us the envy of the world and help create civilized society that lessens the blow caused by irresponsible capitalism that creates recessions…like what we just recently saw.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The government does NOTHING else, they NEVER create wealth, they get it all from the working population.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No business creates wealth either.  The consumer and employee does.  The consumer provides the money and the employee provides the sweat.  That’s how business makes money.  Do you need a refresher course in basic economics?</p>

<p>Every economist agrees lack of government was the cause of the crisis? You’re just pulling that out of your ass.</p>

<p>Just like unsuccessful species go extinct in nature, bad businesses go down if they can’t keep their feet above the water.</p>

<p>So, if a bad business goes down, you don’t believe that will have ANY effect whatsoever outside that business?  Get real.</p>

<p>Where do you think all that money for the bail-outs came from?</p>

</aside>
<p>Us.  To protect ourselves from this shit:<br>

<p>You live in your little government dream world where we can just print money out of thin air (well it’s actually done digitally now) and do whatever we want. Well guess what, it has consequences. It devaluates the currency, people lose their purchasing power, and you probably know what that means for the economy.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I guess Republicans should’ve thought about that before they did the stupid crap that forced us to do this.</p>

<p>The bail-outs made everything worse and just delayed the inevitable.</p>

<p>No.  It lessened the blow.</p>

</aside>
<p>Sorry.  I didn’t realize you were such an idiot and couldn’t understand what an analogy was.</p>
<p>Face facts, Jean.  It is your economic policies that caused this crisis and now you’re blaming us for having to spend money to fix the problem.</p>

            <p>Why are you still alive, Jeannot.</p>
<p>You know what’s the most amusing, you’re using the exact same rhetoric as some of the liberoid tards that would never stop at contaminating my country with bullshit until someone pulls their tongues out and stab the shit with a rusty screwdriver©</p>
<p>They never STFU, blame the bloody State for everything and all as one have that irrational love for capitalism and irrational hatred for the population which is perceived stupid, uncivilized, unintelligent and generally not sophisticated enough to understand all the bling and riches of democracy, free markets and capitalism.</p>
<p>Problem? They are all <span class="bbcode-b">political corpses</span>.<br>
No one listens to those laughing stocks, except for the likes of Ole’ Mike McFaul and those former ‘political advisor’ retards that were told to GTFO in mid 90s - now zealously supporting the piss-poor pathetic opposition.</p>
<p>It really brings a smile to my face.</p>
