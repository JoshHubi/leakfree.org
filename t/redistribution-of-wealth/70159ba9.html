          <p>I haven’t actually read much of this thread but I"ll jump in with my own two cents anyway. Historically countries with large middle classes have been the strongest, so does it not make sense to take money from the vastly wealthy (who 90% of the time got their money raping the public anyway) and use it to fund education and public works and such?</p>
<p>Robin Hood is one of the most well known fairy tales (at least in America) and it’s very moral is take from the rich and give to the poor. It’s so silly when people cry socialist and communist every time someone mentions redistribution of wealth and then go home to read Robin Hood to their kids.</p>

          <p>Seems to be the old debate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynes" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Keynes</a> versus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Friedman.</a></p>
<p>In my opinion Keynesism has a better economic grounding than Freidmanism. This is becasue Freidmanism, whilst an interesting theory has an inherent flaw, that can be seen in the 2009-11 recession and it’s causes. Freidman argued that an entirely competitive and privatised system (i.e. NO governement spending at all where possible) would self-regulate through consumer choice. It failed to take into account corporate greed, purchasing power and monopolism. As western nation adopted Freidmanism, the financial sector lost key government regulation. Through this lack of regulation, the banks were allowed to lend irresponsibly with sub-prime mortgages and loans, eventually seizing up to minimise the astronomical financial risks they’d created, leading to the credit crunch, and a collapse in consumer spending and confidence, which lead to the current economic climate.</p>
<p>In other words, I support redistribution of wealth, because the alternative is a clusterfuck.</p>

<p>First, some entertainment: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTQnarzmTOc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTQnarzmTOc</a></p>
<p>The theory is that people will become weary of putting their money in a bank that is known for irresponsible lending, etc. (and losing their members’ money). And that’s if the bank even survives at all. Obviously banks aren’t going to even be ABLE to continue running irresponsibly. It doesn’t make financial sense.</p>
<p>That is unless you are bailed out, as in the Keynesian model. Because then there’s more incentive to to be irresponsible with the money. Because you get the short term satisfaction of irresponsible spending / loaning, etc. without the fear of long term repercussions. (and you saw what happened when the government tried to take over, rather than letting the market work itself out)</p>
<p>In the Friedman system, the banks would be forced to deal with the repercussions of their actions; they would be held accountable for the risks they take, at their expense, not the taxpayers’.</p>
<p>The reason we got into this mess in the first place is because the banks weren’t afraid of the repercussions. And even if there was a fluke mess up by a business such as a bank in a Friedman / Hayek model, yes, some people would lose a lot of money and it may even very negatively affect our economy–BUT it would change the public’s view of banks, as well as set a precedent example for other banks to be cautious of (that is, if they want customers ever again).</p>
<p>It’s quite fascinating how the free market is inherently regulated. The difference between the regulation between the free market and the government is that businesses are more intimate with what will make the people happy (their customers, and by extension themselves) than the government could ever be.</p>
<p>Also, this does a great job of explaining the myth that is monopolies: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdNC_NpgM1s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdNC_NpgM1s</a></p>

<p>No, of course not. I want as few people to suffer through poverty as possible. But I know that the best way to accomplish this is to let markets work. No system on earth has a better reputation of getting people out of poverty.</p>
<p>And make no mistake, no system is perfect. Not mine, not anyone’s. But I feel, based on logical and empirical evidences that the system I advocate is the best for everyone.</p>
<p>Now, I will say that yes I was making my argument rhetorically. I don’t literally think we should have allowed ourselves to fall into a second great depression. But that’s ONLY because we need to transition out of our current system instead of switching cold turkey. We would have been in that situation with the banks if we had a truly free market (and have always had). We in fact would not have had even the great depression if it weren’t for governmental meddling.

          <p>The very notion of individualism or the so-called “rugged individualist” or the “self-made man” flies in the face of what humanity is.  You ask where you reject the notion that one person’s actions affect another person?  Right here:</p>
<p>“Trust me, if there were a country on this earth today that operated under a pure free market, I’d get my butt over there asap. :-)”</p>
<p>You complain about government meddling, but we create government to protect ourselves from the bad portions of society, whether it’s bailing out failing businesses that, if allowed to fail, would utterly destroy the economy, to possibly breaking up businesses that grow too large (to the point of monopolizing an industry or getting to the point where, if they fail, they’ll take down a major portion of the economy), or just something as simple as law enforcement or contract-dispute resolution.  A “free market” denies basic human nature.</p>
<p>As for making money through creating failing businesses, it happens all the time, whether it seems counter-intuitive or not.  Look at how many failing businesses pay their executives handily in the form of stock options and bonuses, then the business goes under and the executives just go to another business where they’re on the board of directors or take their wealth of knowledge to another business who would be glad to have them help them and then that business begins to fail.</p>
<p>It’s called “failing upward” and can create economic devastation in its wake.  Just look at the mortgage meltdown of just a few years ago for all the evidence you need.  The mortgage meltdown was a result of the LACK of government meddling, not because of it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Let me ask you a quick question.  In the apartment building analogy, your neighbor has a habit of smoking in bed.  So far, nothing has come from it.  However, tonight, he falls asleep with a lit cigarette in his hands and the drapes catch fire.  Then the wall.  Then the other wall.  Then MY WALL, then my stuff, then the next neighbor over, and the next neighbor up and down.</p>
<p>What should be done with that person?  What should’ve happened before this happened to stop that and protect my property?  Don’t I have the right to protect myself and my property?</p>

<p>“Trust me, if there were a country on this earth today that operated under a pure free market, I’d get my butt over there asap. :-)”</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘DeepSkyBlue’]How does my partiality to a free market society indicate that I believe people don’t affect one another? On the contrary, the Austrian business theory is completely based on the concept that both businesses’ and consumers’ actions affect each other and themselves.</p>
<p>You complain about government meddling, but we create government to protect ourselves from the bad portions of society, whether it’s bailing out failing businesses that, if allowed to fail, would utterly destroy the economy, to possibly breaking up businesses that grow too large (to the point of monopolizing an industry or getting to the point where, if they fail, they’ll take down a major portion of the economy), or just something as simple as law enforcement or contract-dispute resolution.  A “free market” denies basic human nature.</p>
<p>[COLOR=’<span class="hashtag">#00bfff</span>’]You’re equating a free market to anarchism. I believe government has a role, and an important one at that. I need a governing body, larger than myself to protect me from the criminal that wants to rape and murder me. But government has no role in breaking down businesses that are performing well or building up businesses that are performing poorly.</p>
<p>As for making money through creating failing businesses, it happens all the time, whether it seems counter-intuitive or not.  Look at how many failing businesses pay their executives handily in the form of stock options and bonuses, then the business goes under and the executives just go to another business where they’re on the board of directors or take their wealth of knowledge to another business who would be glad to have them help them and then that business begins to fail.</p>
<p>It’s called “failing upward” and can create economic devastation in its wake.  Just look at the mortgage meltdown of just a few years ago for all the evidence you need.  The mortgage meltdown was a result of the LACK of government meddling, not because of it.</p>
<p>[COLOR=’<span class="hashtag">#00bfff</span>’]There would be no such thing as the “too big to fail” concept if we lived in a free market society. And I’ve already acknowledged that it’s not entirely bad for the government to have bailed out the businesses in order to keep people from dying on the streets. But in an objective, pragmatic sense, with no regard to morals: we should have let them fail. Yes we would have fallen deep but as I said, it would set a precedent for future banks to look back on in caution. Monopolies would be so short lived in free economies that there would never be a business too big to fail. To look at it any other way is narrow-sighted. I’m afraid we’re going to have to just agree to disagree on this point if I can’t convince you of that as sadly we both see that there has never been a free market so I can only argue philosophy here.</p>
<p>EDIT: Let me ask you a quick question.  In the apartment building analogy, your neighbor has a habit of smoking in bed.  So far, nothing has come from it.  However, tonight, he falls asleep with a lit cigarette in his hands and the drapes catch fire.  Then the wall.  Then the other wall.

<p>What should be done with that person?  What should’ve happened before this happened to stop that and protect my property?  Don’t I have the right to protect myself and my property?</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘DeepSkyBlue’]Well I feel the person should be punished, not given a new apartment. And yes of course you have the right to protect yourself and your property but part of that is also not to put yourself in dangerous situations. So hmm, maybe we can agree that the solution to rich bankers who set up schemes to fail banks in order to make a profit should be to lock them up. I don’t know, I haven’t really thought about it at length yet.</p>

</aside>
<p>That may be true given the system we are living under. Also I was referring to individual responsibility, not government coercion. Also, lest you mention your disdain for the “individual” principle again, pointing out that you believe it goes against human nature, let me remind you of the theory of evolution and survival of the fittest which is basically exactly what a free market would emulate. Now of course your apartment building theory plays a role, and I get that–I’m not trying to dispute the effects others have on us–but just like survival of the fittest or the theory of evolution, if things are left untampered with then the best emerge through time. Not only do the best emerge, but they keep getting better.</p>

</aside>
<p>Let me ask you, how did Microsoft become such a large company? Because they provide the market something that is obviously highly needed, better than the competition. For a company like Microsoft to fail, what would need to happen? Well, people would have to rapidly stop purchasing its products. Even if Microsoft suddenly lost all of its money in a freak hypothetical accident, they are still constantly selling products and services that keeps them well afloat. But if people stopped buying it at a rate so drastic that they failed, then only a small amount of people and businesses would still be reliant on Microsoft and potentially fail with it. It’s amazing how the market works like that.</p>

</aside>
<p>I completely sympathize with the same societal ailments you do. I would hate to see this nation fall into a depression. But we are only making it worse with more disruption of the market. We are creating artificial value in market failures and destroying real value in market successes. When we pervert the market, the market doesn’t work. That’s effectively a tautology. So of course when the government reaches its hands into the market, the market is bound to fail.</p>

<p>Yes, we as individuals do have that right. But we as a government don’t have the right to coerce others into “being protected” against their will. Such is true with drugs, and mutually, economics.</p>

</aside>
<p>My friend, the entire Microsoft scenario began as a hypothetical when you introduced it. My point is that in a free market situation, it would be nearly impossible for a very successful business to instantly fail and spark a domino effect of failure in its wake. If a very successful business were to fail, it would fail somewhat slowly and would not be very successful by the time it failed, thus leaving few victims in the aftermath.</p>
