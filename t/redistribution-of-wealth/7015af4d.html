<p>I had to take a break from the thread for a while. Daniel, I commend you highly on your endurance of online debates. Kudos for that. Seems to remind me of that one XKCD comic. Either way, rather than tangling this web further by picking out all of your points yet again, let me shed some more light on my personal economic views. I recently came across a video that I think touches on a lot of what this debate circled around (in a much more effective way than I have been able to convey).<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGPa5Ob-5Ps&amp;feature=feedu" data-bbcode="true">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGPa5Ob-5Ps&amp;feature=feedu</a></p>

</aside>
<p>Oh, where to begin…  Let me use that format and let me take his claims and call them myths.</p>
<p>Myth <span class="hashtag">#1</span> in this video: Companies give people jobs.</p>
<p>Business has never created a single job.  Business would not even exist without consumer demand.  An investor would not invest in a business that did not have a business plan that would return their investment back to them.  Without consumer demand, there would not be any jobs.</p>
<p>They don’t hire people to pull them out of poverty and allow them to live civilized lives.  No.  They have to hire people to get a job done.  But they can’t hire people for nothing.  They know that, in order to get the job done, they have to pay a certain amount of money to the employee.</p>
<p>Myth <span class="hashtag">#2:</span>  Regulation hurt business and capitalism.</p>
<p>Regulation does not hurt business.  Regulation helps business.  Regulation such as anti-trust regulation ensures competition which Miron claims capitalism needs.  Lack of regulation REDUCES competition.</p>
<p>Myth <span class="hashtag">#3:</span> Capitalism rewards people for being productive.</p>
<p>This couldn’t be further from the truth.  Capitalism, “true capitalism”, that is “laissez-faire capitalism” does <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">NOT</span></span> “reward” people for being productive.  You can become rich without even breaking a sweat and working your fingers to the bone will not guarantee wealth.</p>
<p>Myth <span class="hashtag">#4:</span> Regulation hurts the less-skilled.</p>
<p>This is just silly.  He just asserts this without evidence.</p>
<p>Myth <span class="hashtag">#5:</span> Government interferes with capitalism.</p>
<p>No.  Capitalism is like fire.  Controlled, it is a spectacular tool that does wonders.  Uncontrolled, it becomes a spectacular apocalypse.</p>
<p>Myth <span class="hashtag">#6:</span> Government intervention caused the economic crisis.</p>
<p>Oh, please.  It was LACK of government intervention that caused it.  Almost every economist agrees with this.  Government did not incentivize risk-taking.  They allowed risk-taking by REMOVING REGULATION.  He implies that government made business take risks.  He is absolutely right that bad policy caused this economic crisis.  But it was reduction of regulation, not government interference that caused it.</p>
<p>Myth <span class="hashtag">#7:</span> Governmental bailouts incentivize failure.</p>
<p>Actually, governmental bailouts lessen the blow from failure.  Without bailouts, the economy would’ve been much worse and far more in the hole and would take us much longer to get out of.  What Miron ignores is that when a business becomes very large, if that business fails, the economy suffers.  We suffer when the business fails.  We have a right, do we not, to protect ourselves from those that will hurt us?  The risk-takers would not have paid the price even if the bailouts had not happened.</p>
<hr>
<p>I do not advocate socialism or communism.  Nor do I advocate laissez-faire capitalism.  We got just a taste of laissez-faire capitalism during 2001-2008 and it brought us the economic crisis.  We don’t need that again.  We need capitalism, but we need to have rules on how it works.</p>
<p>Look at an intersection with a traffic light.  If the traffic light goes out, without something to control the flow of traffic, it quickly becomes a snarl of traffic.  I witnessed this just a few months ago.  With the traffic light, it would take me about 3 minutes to get through the intersection.  I’ve been through that intersection many times.  This time, the light was out (bit spooky, too, since I had just left watching “Super 8” in the theater, but that’s not important right now), and I was in the intersection for twenty minutes before finally getting through it.</p>
<p>We need a balance of control and capitalism.  Laissez-faire capitalism is the malfunctioning traffic light.  Real capitalism, the kind that Miron attacks in this video, is what raises all boats.</p>
<p>Miron ignores reality.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but most people work for a living. They need this thing called money in order to make a living. If you don’t work, you get no money, that’s how it goes for most of us. For those few people who come from wealthy families it’s a different story, but you make it sound as if that means capitalism does not reward ANY people for being productive. That’s just bullshit.</p>

</aside>
<p>No that’s not silly, regulation does hurt less-skilled people. For example, because of minimum wage laws an employer might not consider to add another employee. Most people start at the bottom and work their way up, but if you force companies to pay a specific amount of money then they will think twice before hiring another person. This leaves the person without a job.</p>

<p>What complete utter bullshit, the government is a cancer to capitalism. It does nothing more than spend all the wealth created by the people. It takes money from one group of people and gives it to another (money redistribution). Just look at the amount of debt for crying out loud, all the endless billions pouring into fancy government programs that I’m sure you love so much. The government does NOTHING else, they NEVER create wealth, they get it all from the working population.</p>

<p>Just like unsuccessful species go extinct in nature, bad businesses go down if they can’t keep their feet above the water. Where do you think all that money for the bail-outs came from? You live in your little government dream world where we can just print money out of thin air (well it’s actually done digitally now) and do whatever we want. Well guess what, it has consequences. It devaluates the currency, people lose their purchasing power, and you probably know what that means for the economy. The bail-outs made everything worse and just delayed the inevitable.</p>

          <p>Why are you still alive, Jeannot.</p>
<p>You know what’s the most amusing, you’re using the exact same rhetoric as some of the liberoid tards that would never stop at contaminating my country with bullshit until someone pulls their tongues out and stab the shit with a rusty screwdriver©</p>
<p>They never STFU, blame the bloody State for everything and all as one have that irrational love for capitalism and irrational hatred for the population which is perceived stupid, uncivilized, unintelligent and generally not sophisticated enough to understand all the bling and riches of democracy, free markets and capitalism.</p>
<p>Problem? They are all <span class="bbcode-b">political corpses</span>.<br>
No one listens to those laughing stocks, except for the likes of Ole’ Mike McFaul and those former ‘political advisor’ retards that were told to GTFO in mid 90s - now zealously supporting the piss-poor pathetic opposition.</p>
<p>It really brings a smile to my face.</p>

<p>No that’s not silly, regulation does hurt less-skilled people. For example, because of minimum wage laws an employer might not consider to add another employee.

          <p>And here we are in loops again. And the sad thing is, people like ODB and DSG get a negative view of capitalism / free markets because those of us (including myself) who are still babes in the philosophy are far too closedminded in our application.</p>
<p>I’m gonna address a couple things and go for now:<br>
The housing crisis was predicted a few years before anyone else saw it coming by the free market thinkers and some politicians like Ron Paul, citing the flawed economic policies which were (at the time, and still) contributing to it.</p>
<p>Now, Daniel, you are absolutely right that if we applied a pure free market system tomorrow, we’d all die (figuratively) because we are so dependent upon government assistance. But you need to realize that there are only so many bandaids you can put on a system before you need to revert to a better foundation.</p>
<p>I’m not wise enough to know how to get from where we are to where we need to be, but the solutions we are employing are only temporary and exasperating the problem in the long run.</p>
<p>No system is perfect, but I am so far convinced freer markets are better ones.</p>

<p>Most of which was caused by government spending and tax cuts.  Seriously, you need to open your eyes, Jean.  You are so full of shit.</p>

</aside>
<p>LOL so governments are all so deep in debt because they didn’t take enough money from the people? Well hey, why don’t you make an example by giving all your income to the state. And if you know government spending causes debt, then why the fuck are you being such a poster boy for bail-outs and government liabilities? Contradict yourself much. And he says I’m the one whose full of shit. This is getting more hilarious by the hour!</p>

<p>Horse.  Shit.  Don’t pull that crap on me.  These “fancy government programs” are something that we demanded the government create because we’re not as stupid as you are.  We know that these “fancy government programs” make us the envy of the world and help create civilized society that lessens the blow caused by irresponsible capitalism that creates recessions…like what we just recently saw.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not denying the morality behind these programs, looking at it from such a point I would certainly agree those programs are for the good of the people. BUT, that doesn’t change the fact that they are <span class="bbcode-b">unsustainable</span>. These programs are by far the largest portion of government spending, and pretty much every nation is in debt. The US is the primary example of just how hard these liabilities have failed. Yes they are nice, no they are not sustainable. Again, the government creates absolutely no wealth. It’s the people that work that create the wealth. But if you think printing money out of thin air is going to pay the bills, you might want to check out Germany 1923 again.</p>

<p>Well, pure capitalism. Go look at England during the industrial revolution. That’s pure capitalism. Mix some socialism in there, and we have our modern society.

</aside>
<p>Honestly how old are you? You’re regurgitating a high school class lesson. The laws passed during the industrial revolution were done so after the markets had already weeded out the poor working conditions, etc. I’ll paraphrase a quote: “Government is the person who jumps in front of a parade and pretends to be leading it.”<br>
Sure, there were some fringe areas that still were not up-to-date with this concept and <span class="bbcode-i">were</span> positively affected by the laws passed; but it just doesn’t make pragmatic sense to put laws down on the books which are supposed to hold up to future conditions. Inefficiency is the word I’m looking for. In the long run, the laws tend to provide hindrances to progress and have a greater negative net effect.</p>

<p>Hold up a moment…  Government spending does not necessarily cause debt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then why the fuck are you being such a poster boy for bail-outs and government liabilities? Contradict yourself much.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No contradiction.  You just don’t understand the subject.  Government bailouts help soften the blow to the economy when stupid people (such as yourself) create a recession by completely insane economic practices.</p>
<p>Oh you know this is true.  Don’t try to deny it.  If a business grows to a certain size and then fails, it takes the economy down with it.  We’ve already seen this happen with the subprime crisis.  Business fails and the economy suffers.  Open your eyes!</p>

These programs are by far the largest portion of government spending, and pretty much every nation is in debt.</p>

<p>Where do consumers get the money to buy goods or services? By working for companies. So, in effect, it’s the companies that give consumers the ability to consume, and therefore create jobs. You could say, then, that businesses create jobs.</p>
<p>You can go as far back as you want (inception lol) but the reality is that it’s the businesses that create the jobs, influenced by consumer demand.</p>
