    <title>Half Life Tattoo</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-tattoo/11003</link>
    <description>So guys, i wanted to come here to tell you about a few ideas i had for tattoos recently.

I have been working in an environment that allowed tattoo&#39;s for 5 years, i dont intend to go anywhere and i only go up in this business, and they are very ok with tattoo&#39;s so i decided i was going to get a full sleeve.

However, after many ideas (Some involving a mixture of everything i narrowed it down to two ideas)

I wanted to get a sleeve with Cthulhu fighting the tentacles from Half Life in it, it combines my favourite written fiction combined with my favourite enemy FROM my favourite game, however in terms of realism it makes no sence (I know it is a tattoo but cmon, Cthulhu, the size of mountains, a god like entity fighting Xen creatures.) It would be kickass yes but i&#39;m debating that.

However i had an idea of getting a full sleeve based just on the Half Life theme, mainly Half Life 1/Black Mesa but some elements of Half Life 2 i wouldnt mind. Does anyone have any thoughts on what i could add?

Sorry if this is in the wrong section, wanted an idea from other fans.</description>

<p>Got this today in celebration of the release, brought me back.<br>
Half Life was the first game that got me into video games, computers and technology in the first place and in that regard I owe it a debt of gratitude. Without it I wouldn’t have experienced all those fine digital narratives that I’m sure you’ve all had your share in experiencing. I wouldn’t have my review sites or be interested in the things I’m interested in. There are about thirty different meanings for the symbol, but us nerds all know the true meaning, it’s that game that made us believe storytelling in a game was possible, and more than just watching pixels crash into each other - plus you get to hit dudes in the face with a crowbar.</p>

            <p>That is a very cool Lambda, i was thinking of getting one but i’m more of a full art kinda guy, i wouldnt want to get just a symbol on my arm or body i would rather have an image of something. So i’m still stuck with what to get, gonna go into the tattooist and ask him to whip up some stuff.</p>

I can refuse to wear my seatbelt, tell cops to suck it at DUI checkpoints, and generally do as I please. Here you have rights, you have to know them however so that you can know your boundaries when you’re harassed by law entities.</p>
<p>Sorry, I can’t agree with you on that one.</p>
<p>Unless you’re talking about the rights of the moral compass, in that case I don’t really have any comment.</p>

<p>You aren’t the first one to think of that. =]</p>
<p>And they chose it for “The lambda signifies unity under oppression” and I’m perfectly fine with that.</p>
<p>May I direct your attention to all of these.</p>
<p>Lambda can mean the empty set in mathematics, though other symbols are more commonly used, such as .<br>
The lambda particle is a type of subatomic particle in subatomic particle physics.<br>
Lambda is the set of logical axioms in the axiomatic method of logical deduction in first-order logic.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Lambda was used as a shield pattern by the Spartan Army. This stood for Lakedaimon, the name of the region of Sparta</span>.<br>
Lambda is the von Mangoldt function in mathematical number theory.<br>
In statistics, Wilks’s lambda is used in multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA analysis) to compare group means on a combination of dependent variables.<br>
In the spectral decomposition of matrices, lambda indicates the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of the matrix (mathematics).<br>
In computer science, lambda is the time window over which a process is observed for determining the working memory set for a digital computer’s virtual memory management.<br>
In astrophysics, lambda represents the likelihood that a small body will encounter a planet or a dwarf planet leading to a deflection of a significant magnitude. An object with a large value of lambda is expected to have cleared its neighborhood, satisfying the current definition of a planet.<br>
In crystal optics, lambda is used to represent the period of a lattice.<br>
In NATO military operations, a chevron (a capital lambda symbol) is painted on the vehicles of this military alliance for identification. (The Spartan army used a capital lambda on its shields.)<br>
In electrochemistry, lambda denotes the “equivalent conductance” of an electrolyte solution.<br>
In cosmology, lambda is the symbol for the cosmological constant.<br>
In optics, lambda denotes the grating pitch of a Bragg reflector.<br>
In Evolutionary Algorithm, λ indicates the number of offspring which would be generated from μ current population in each generation. the terms μ and λ are originated from Evolution strategy notation.<br>
Lambda indicates the wavelength of any wave, especially in physics, electronics engineering, and mathematics.<br>
Lambda indicates the radioactivity decay constant in nuclear physics and radioactivity. This constant is very simply related (by a multiplicative constant) to the half-life of any radioactive material.<br>
In probability theory, lambda represents the density of occurrences within a time interval, as modeled by the Poisson distribution.<br>
In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda is used to introduce an anonymous function expressed with the concepts of lambda calculus.<br>
Lambda is a non-SI metric unit of measure of volume (symbol λ) equal to one microliter (1 μL) or one cubic millimeter (1 mm3). This always rare use is currently deprecated.<br>
Lambda indicates an eigenvalue in the mathematics of linear algebra.<br>
In the physics of electric fields, lambda sometimes indicates the linear charge density of a uniform line of electric charge (measured in coulombs per meter).<br>
Lambda denotes a Lagrange multiplier in multi-dimensional calculus.<br>
In solid-state electronics, lambda indicates the channel length modulation parameter of a MOSFET.<br>
There is a lambda phage virus in biology.<br>
In ecology, lambda denotes the long-term intrinsic growth rate of a population. This value is often calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the age/size class matrix (mathematics).<br>
In formal language theory and in computer science, lambda denotes the empty string.<br>
In telecommunications, lambda indicates the wavelength in a wavelength-division multiplexing optical communications system. This is actually a form of the long-established concept of frequency-division multiplexing.<br>
Lambda denotes the Lebesgue measure in mathematical set theory.<br>
The Goodman and Kruskal’s lambda in statistics indicates the proportional reduction in error when one variable’s values are used to predict the values of another variable.<br>
Lambda denotes the oxygen sensor in a vehicle that measures the air-to-fuel ratio in the exhaust gases of an internal-combustion engine.<br>
The Lambda (rocket) is a version of a large booster rocket in Japanese outer-space technology.<br>
Lambda denotes the failure rate of devices and systems in reliability theory, and it is measured in failure events per hour. Numerically, this lambda is also the reciprocal of the mean time between failures.<br>
In criminology, lambda denotes an individual’s frequency of offenses.<br>
In cartography and navigation, lambda denotes the longitude of a location.<br>
Lambda is the symbol of the musician Richard D. James or Aphex Twin.<br>
Lambda denotes Christopher Langton’s parameter for the classification of Stephen Wolfram’s classes of cellular automata.<br>
In electrochemistry, lambda also denotes the ionic conductance of a given ion (The composition of the ion is generally shown as a subscript to the lambda character).<br>
In neurobiology, lambda denotes the length constant (or exponential rate of decay) of the electric potential across the cell membrane along a length of a nerve cell’s axon.<br>
In the science and technology of heat transfer, lambda denotes the heat of vaporization per mole of material (a.k.a. its “latent heat”).[4]<br>
In the technology and science of celestial navigation, lambda denotes the longitude as opposed to the Roman letter “L” which denotes the latitude.<br>
King Louis XIII of France used the letter lambda as his personal symbol rather than monogram.<br>
In Volvo automobiles, lambda denotes an engine, fuel, or ignition system failure.<br>
A modified (block style) Lambda is used as a recurring symbol in the Valve computer game series Half-Life, referring to the Lambda complex of the fictional Black Mesa Research Facility.<br>
The lambda was selected as a symbol by the Gay Activists Alliance of New York in 1970, and declared the international symbol for gay and lesbian rights by the International Gay Rights Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1974.<br>
The “lambda sign” is used for diagnosis of dichorionic twins in obstetric ultrasonography</p>
