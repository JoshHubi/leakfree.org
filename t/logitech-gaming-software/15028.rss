    <description>Hey guys, was wondering if you might have some insight to help me here. I&#39;m trying to install the Logitech Gaming Software to configure my mouse, and it&#39;s binds. Whenever I try to run the installer, it just opens up my user folder (users&gt;&quot;myname.exe&quot;) instead of actually installing the software. Any ideas on how to actually get it installed? I&#39;m a little stumped. Am I missing something really obvious? Thanks in advance!</description>
