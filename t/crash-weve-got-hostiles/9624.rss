    <title>[CRASH] We&#39;ve got Hostiles</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-weve-got-hostiles/9624</link>
    <description>I was playing through the rooms with the turrets just near the start of the chapter, and as I bumped a set of laser tripwires, the game stuttered, and crashed. The exact location that it happened is the part where you climb over the boxes, hit the blast door trigger just as you trigger some tripwires for turrets in the prior room to shoot you in the ass. The next room has two scientists in it. (Haven&#39;t gotten farther than that so far.) Figured I would submit this first.
