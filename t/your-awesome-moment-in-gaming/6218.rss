<p>This.</p>
<p>I’ve had quite a few badass moments while sniping. I scoped in and saw a guy sprinting and moved to make up for the bullet delay and shot. There was a tree in the way but the bullet went THROUGH the tree and pegged the guy in the face. Another time I saw a guy running for a massive spot of foliage and didn’t get him fast enough, so I aimed into the foliage and shot were I predicted he would be after several seconds of running and got him. Then I got a double kill one shot. A different time I went rambo with the sniper rifle and someone got the jump on me and started shooting with an AR. I scoped in and headshotted him before I was even low health. In the same life the exact same thing happened and I headshotted in well under half a second again. Then there was another time when I flanked a massive group of one or two squads while using the m95. I popped my head out and shot the shit out of them with the m1911 and then ducked every time I had to reload. I got about 6 of them before they figured out I was there and killed me.</p>
<p>Wall of text.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  As you can tell I like BFBC2, especially sniping in it. Nothing is more satisfying then pulling off and insane headshot and then watching the marksman headshot points stack up.</p>

            <p>Probably while playing CoD: MW1 at a friends house. 3 of us were together in a small LAN match. I forget the level, but there was a broken house with brick walls, a few holes in the walls, and inside a staircase. Out of the corner of my eye, I spot the slightest movement coming from inside the house on the staircase. In an instant, without so much as thinking, I turn about 90 degrees, and shoot a single bullet through the brick work to score a perfect headshot.</p>
<p>I still can’t figure out how I did it, I barely registered the person let alone being able to actually make the shot.</p>

<p>My first time facing the butcher in Diablo. I saw a room with a bunch of bodies, wondered what this guy looks like - opened the door and :aah:.</p>
<p>I nearly shat myself when he said fresh meat. I ran into a room with a bookshelf and closed the door thinking I was safe, only to have him open the door and kill me in one hit. I didn’t realize boss monsters could open doors until then.</p>

</aside>
<p>I remember freaking out too… I was playing with a friend beside me, and we both had a major “WTF IS THAT SHIT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA” moment.</p>
<p>One moment I remember is … a while ago, back when the gamecube was brand new. Some guys brought one in the small room reserved for students of their department, and they had Super Smash Bros Melee. I had played quite a bit of Super Smash Bros on the N64, but none of that. And these guys had been playing it for a while. I asked if I could play, and they were hesitant, thinking I’d get owned. But I pretty much kicked asses for a couple of rounds straight.</p>
<p>Samus FTW.</p>
<p>Their pride took quite a hit… beaten by the newbie. Nothing spectacular, but for some reason I remember this pretty well.</p>

<p>I can tell you what my best gaming experience on 18 January. running to stop the game, picking up the special edition large 2 small surgery in the world to open it, so do not break anything, sniffing the contents (such as new car smell to the players) and play as long as possible. when I’m tired, I drink Monster Energy drinks ASSAULT and keep playing. All you could do better if they were Mountain Dew Game Fuel available with Little Big Planet 2.</p>

            <p>He was just very lucky.</p>
<p>Wall shooting is not exclusive to CS btw. Call of Duty also has it. Battlefield Bad Company 2 too as well. The more simulator-ish tactical action games have had it for ages.</p>

<p>Are you confusing wall hacking with wall shooting, per chance?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There’s a difference?</p>
<p>Now I’m honestly confused. Since when can you shoot through a brick wall?</p>

<p>You can shoot through walls in Counter-Strike. It’s a feature.</p>
<p>best part of that feature is in cs_assault. You go up to little back room where they keep the hostages and shoot the fucking hell out of the wall with a machinegun. If there’s people holed up in there, you might hit them in the foot after your shots end up murdering all the hostages.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like the feature where my gun automatically aims at all the enemies coming towards me, and instantly fires my gun as soon as they enter my FOV. Makes playing so much more enjoyable.</p>
