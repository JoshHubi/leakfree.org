    <title>Micro Lags in BMS</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/micro-lags-in-bms/9682</link>
    <description>Hey,

all my source games working fine but in BMS im getting micro lags sometimes. if i enter a new area or shoot a new weapon mostly.

Console:

Loading game from SAVE\autosave.sav...
Loading game from //MOD/SAVE/bm_c1a3a.HL1...
Error! Variable &quot;$surfaceprop&quot; is multiply defined in material &quot;models/props_c17/oil_drum_chunks001a&quot;!
npc_maker v_01_m_p has no specified NPC-to-spawn classname.
npc_maker v_02_m_p has no specified NPC-to-spawn classname.
Error! Flag &quot;$halflambert&quot; is multiply defined in material &quot;models/props_construction/light_floodlight01_on&quot;!
Attempting to precache model, but model name is NULL
Redownloading all lightmaps
Physics queue not empty, error!
Physics queue not empty, error!

how can i fix this ?
im playing @ 1920x1080@ everything maxed out (vsync off)
i got an i7 3770k, 8gig ram, Samsung 830 SSD and a HD6870.
So it cant be my rig imho. and all other games working normally.


i can also not set Mutlicore Rendering for some reason, there is no &quot;ON &gt;&gt; OFF&quot; setting for me...

            <p>Everyone is getting stutters, FPS drops and so on with BM. Depending on the hardware specs and quality settings used it could be anything from “a little bit annoying” to “show-stopper” thing.</p>
<p>To help developers find and fix all the cases when people get stutters and FPS dropdowns please read sticky BEFORE YOU POST thread and make sure to post screenshots with budget panel turned on. You could read info on how to turn this panel on in the sticky FAQ thread in this section of the forum.</p>

            <p>I also am getting microlags sometimes, although it appears to be at random. I’m not running at full graphics either. For me it is both an audio and visual lag.</p>

<p>I had a problem when sometimes the sound would stutter, and during the stutter i had visual lag as well. It got better after I turned off my Anti-virus (avast) and Windows Defender.</p>
<p>Maybe it helps</p>

<p>Multicore rendering wasn’t added until the 2009 build of the Source Engine, Black Mesa uses 2007.<br>
Also yes there are ALOT of bugs to be fixed in the mod, but once those are fixed it’s gonna be the coolest bestest mod EVUR!.</p>
<p>Hope it gets on Steam soon so the Devs can just release updates as they wish, and not have to make a bizilion patches.</p>
