    <description>Hey guys what&#39;s up I&#39;m going to stream a playthrough of Black Mesa with additional commentary from my friend Bojaxc. 

Can be seen here:

Anyways having already played through it I thought it was pretty well done in graphics and music, the only thing I think was a bit off was the game balance with the aliens being too easy and marines too difficult. Overall though great job for the dev team I am a big fan of Half-Life and have been following Black Mesa since middle school, can&#39;t wait for the Xen levels!</description>
