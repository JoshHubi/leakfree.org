    <description>So, I&#39;m looking for some help over a strange wirelss network issue.

I&#39;ve brought my PC back home from uni (for the first time, it was built up there) and connected it to our home wireless. But I get throttled whenever I try doing something;

[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4259709/BM%20stuff/Untitled.png[/img]

The first activity spike is where I tried loading facebook. First page loaded fine, by the time I tried changing page, it had throttled me down to 0 again. And obviously, teh second spike is when I started downloading via steam, and it knocked me on the head again.

I have no idea what this might be, I connected just like normal, by adding the network and entering details.

Any ideas? Thanks.

p.s. It won&#39;t let me install FEAR without the 2 crappy expansions :&#39;(

            <p>make sure they are 6 channels apart or else they could be causing interference to each other. This would seriously degrade the wireless signal.</p>

            <p>This incredible…</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4259709/BM%20stuff/P1090709.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>I moved the dongle from the back of the PC, to resting on the shelf (with an extentsion)…</p>
<p>All issues solved. Speeds are excellent, faster than my laptop, which has always been a good one for networking.</p>
<p>The wireless signal is incredibly strange and non-uniform in this house, it’s the same situation with my other PC (an extension cable). How can moving the dongle 1m make so much difference?</p>

            <p>Next time it happens, try pinging a domain name that you<br>
know the IP address of. Ping both the name and the IP.</p>
<p>This will tell us if it’s just the DNS that is going out or all of the internet.<br>
(I’ve has a similar situation for a while on my home network required a modem.router restart)</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem. Although web browsers fork fine for me, when I start downloading something via a bittorent client, the traffic breaks down to 0 after a few minutes. Then I have to either wait a few minutes or reset the wireless router to fix the problem. Thought it was due to either some settings of the router or the bittorent client. Tried to fiddle with those, but no succes.</p>
