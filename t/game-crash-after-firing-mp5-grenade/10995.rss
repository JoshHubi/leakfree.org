    <title>Game Crash after firing MP5 grenade</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crash-after-firing-mp5-grenade/10995</link>
    <description>Indeed. At the part where the planes flyby (I don&#39;t know what chapter/map is it called) but it&#39;s on the Black Mesa trailer as well. Either way, after leaving the water pipe and jumping to the third rock, firing a MP5 grenade, where that soldier and that sentry gun or whatnot are, will crash the game. I&#39;ve made that twice and same result... so... it&#39;s something you should avoid using, the grenades.

Cheers!
PS: Not sure if it&#39;s a bug, however, this happened to me twice so I had to report.

            <p>Might be a yet another physics-related bug, some people had reported similar issues for this place of the map - i.e. crashes after they throw any object down the cliff.</p>
