            <p>PLZZZZ follow the bug reporting guidelines and make a habbit of performing a forum search before starting up a new thread. As you hadn’t posted your hardware specs I can’t tell for sure but chances are 90% that you’re on outdated hardware or use Intel GPU to play the game. Read sticky FAQ thread to get info on how to switch the game into dxlevel 90/95/98 mode and try using one of workarounds for legacy/old hardware I propose here (reported to help people having exactly the same problem as yours): <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=502093#post502093" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=502093#post502093</a></p>
