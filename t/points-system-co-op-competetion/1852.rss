    <title>Points System, Co-op competetion</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/points-system-co-op-competetion/1852</link>
    <description>This sort of goes hand in hand with Achievements but it&#39;s different enough that I figured it should be in a separate suggestion thread. This idea is directed more towards Co-op if/when that is added to the mod. Single player should be more for the actual experience, but I think Co-op could use a little fun.

The idea is to have a points system that keeps track of the players&#39; stats and achievements. When a player kills a monster, gets an achievement, finds an easter egg, does X amount of damage, survives Y amount of time, etc., he or she receives points. That way there is a sort of fun competitive edge amongst all of the players as they progress through the game.

It wouldn&#39;t really effect the actual game-play (i.e. the points wouldn&#39;t give you anything other than bragging rights), but it gives the players a reason to compete a little, rather than just mindlessly blow aliens away for hours. It would, however, be dependent on a large variety of co-op friendly achievements. It wouldn&#39;t be fun if everyone was just rushing through the game trying to get to a certain place first for an achievement.

I thought of this after remembering playing through the original Half-Life in Sven Co-op the other month with some friends at a LAN party and finding it surprisingly disappointing. Having just a few extra fun things like points and achievements could really help spice things up a bit and make it a more re-playable experience.

Anyways, I know I might get shot down for straying away from traditional Half-Life material, but do you guys have any comments/ideas?</description>

</aside>
<p>I agree. The co-op needs to be different, not just harder than singleplayer. It should require teamwork. In terms of being very punishing to solo’s in multiplayers.<br>
Take the L4D hunter for example: Causes death/heavy damage if player if away from the group and the player can’t stop him before he reaches him.</p>
<p>PS: Is there any information about how many players co-op works on (2/4/more)?</p>

<p>With the exception of leo, everyone seems to be discussing more about whether or not there should be an achievement/point system in co-op, so I guess its with in the bounds…</p>
<p>I wouldn’t doubt they already have an achievement system worked out for coop, but it would be nice to have a point system. It would certaintly make for more fun IMHO.</p>

<p>That’s actually a really good idea - sort of like the smoker in L4D, one of your buddies has to shoot it.</p>
<p>But yeah I didn’t mean this purely as an achievements Idea, I just wanted to throw out an idea I had to give the option to add a bit of re playability without changing the fundamentals of the game. I’m sure we will see lots of stuff like this in future maps and mods of Black Mesa. The devs already confirmed that achievements are in, we just don’t know if there will be any co-op oriented ones (especially considering we don’t even know if there will be co-op on first release).</p>

            <p>I think the only problem with this is because of the nature of the game, a point system might become TOO competitive. It works well in L4D because the game is forced co-op. You can’t go around kill stealing from everyone or you’ll piss your teammates off or ruin the chance of victory. Because of this heavy co-op emphasis, it really just works as a way to trick people into working harder.</p>
<p>Half-Life, I would imagine, won’t be heavily co-op. Because of this, I imagine it might lead to less co-op and more competition which might ruin the experience in some ways. I do like the idea of special achievements, though.</p>

<p>Besides, if competive co op goes in it’s highly likely it will be optional (play straight or competitive) which would be great</p>

            <p>i always thought competitive cooperation was sort of an oxymoron, although something similar was implemented in Decay.</p>

            <p>Some co-op exclusive achievements would be nice</p>
<p>eg. 150 assists<br>
Clear a room of at least 10 enemies in under 30 seconds</p>
<p>Also, if this gets in the points should be for who does the most damage, otherwise people will just steal kills, rather than working together</p>

            <p>This sort of goes hand in hand with Achievements but it’s different enough that I figured it should be in a separate suggestion thread. This idea is directed more towards Co-op if/when that is added to the mod. Single player should be more for the actual experience, but I think Co-op could use a little fun.</p>
<p>The idea is to have a points system that keeps track of the players’ stats and achievements. When a player kills a monster, gets an achievement, finds an easter egg, does X amount of damage, survives Y amount of time, etc., he or she receives points. That way there is a sort of fun competitive edge amongst all of the players as they progress through the game.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t really effect the actual game-play (i.e. the points wouldn’t give you anything other than bragging rights), but it gives the players a reason to compete a little, rather than just mindlessly blow aliens away for hours. It would, however, be dependent on a large variety of co-op friendly achievements. It wouldn’t be fun if everyone was just rushing through the game trying to get to a certain place first for an achievement.</p>
<p>I thought of this after remembering playing through the original Half-Life in Sven Co-op the other month with some friends at a LAN party and finding it surprisingly disappointing. Having just a few extra fun things like points and achievements could really help spice things up a bit and make it a more re-playable experience.</p>
<p>Anyways, I know I might get shot down for straying away from traditional Half-Life material, but do you guys have any comments/ideas?</p>
