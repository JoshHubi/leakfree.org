    <title>Comment on the Soundtrack (by Joel Nielsen)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/comment-on-the-soundtrack-by-joel-nielsen/9269</link>
    <description>I have just listened to the soundtrack and i&#39;m still in awe - The superb quality of the ambient music and the the tracks with Rock/Post Rock influence are unbelievable and everything seriously sounds like a Motion Picture Soundtrack for a Hollywood Production. 

Congratulations to Mr. Nielsen [/SIZE]

My most favourite pieces so far:

Blast Pit tracks 1 and 2 (Remix)
End Credits Part 1
The Inbound tracks
All Questionable Ethics tracks
and all four Surface tension tracks

I&#39;m still missing the track from the &quot;On the rail&quot; leaked video, any chance it will be available too?</description>

            <p>Tracks like “Questionable Ethics” is a bit more like Bailey’s songs from HL2 Episode 1 and 2. It could be awesome hear some songs like that in the Black Mesa OST but I got to remember that’s your style, your music.<br>
Again, nice work Joel.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Inbound Part 3 is my obsession right now! Apprehension (along with the Mesa Mix) are great as well. The whole album is very well done! I haven’t heard a soundtrack for a mod this good since Neotokyo.</p>

</aside>
<p>I was actually able to get on a range. Although most of what I recorded was just used as a ‘sweetener’ to library sounds. I don’t have much advice, other than, experiment a lot. You would be much better off asking a professional that works on AAA titles, as I’m sure I did everything completely backwards of how it ‘should’ be done…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Quick question…was Joel allowed to play the mod and get a feel of the levels to properly add the corresponding music sequences?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, I was actually quite involved in the development. I did all the sound effects in the mod, (including the ambient sound scripting for each level), provided game play ideas / feedback (some of it actually made it into the game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ), and tested the game alongside all the other devs.</p>
<p>Other than the Vox work, everything else you hear in the game is my fault.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Don’t see why not. Not only is he part of the team but all the music was designed specifically to fit with the sections.</p>
<p>I picked 3 random ones to listen to, which were Unforseen Consequences, Lambda Core and the new We’ve Got Hostiles.<br>
Holy fucking shit.<br>
If the rest of the soundtrack is this great, I can’t even imagine how it must feel to play AND hear the amazingness that has been composed. Lambda Core is so odd, but in a good way.</p>

            <p>HL1 and Black Mesa’s soundtrack are = Equally good. I see what Joel did, a hybrid between Kelly Bailey, 90s Metal, and Orchestral music. It fits good together.</p>
<p>I liked that he didn’t remix the original tracks, they were already perfect and couldn’t be made better, instead he tried something different. I like that. It’d be boring to only have one kind of music for so long, changes in textures has to be made often to make it interesting.</p>
<p>I fail to see why all the complainers call this “Typical orchestral music” It is not typical at all, there are huge differences between this soundtrack and the million generic CoD/Modern-military type soundtracks, its also more electronic and less orchestral than that. Most of it was sampled electronically with additional live-instrument samples put in. Good job with the soundtrack Joel! This was worth it.</p>
<p>Congrats.</p>

            <p>Yeah I’m trying not to listen to too much (Somehow I’ve managed to completely avoid QE 1 and Forget about Freeman, but I loved some of the ones that I did hear, so I currently have a playlist of some HL1 tracks with the old “lighter” BM surface tension/we’ve got hostiles, and Surface Tension 2. That way there’s only one song I really listened to, and the others will be different to my ear in the actual game when I play.</p>
<p>I am tempted to put all the original HL1 music in, but if I do, that would just be to see how it feels, and also to see how it meshes up with Black Mesa, not because I prefer it to the BM OST (TBH I actually like some of the BM OST better than the HL1 OST, with exceptions such as Nuclear Mission Jam or Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar, etc.)</p>

            <p>It is indeed awesome, and I can hear the EP2 inspiration, especially in certain parts of songs like Surface Tension 2</p>

            <p>Awesome! I’ve always liked the music of the HL series, it finds a nice balance between action oriented songs and ambient, atmospheric electronic sounds. I think BM’s soundtrack will be no exception!</p>

<p>Hey Joel! I’ve listened to a couple of tracks, but can’t wait to sit down and listen to them in  game. I’ve noticed that this soundtrack is very guitar driven, as opposed to Kelly Bailey’s more electronic and synth sound. I’m just wondering what your reason was behind this.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, it was indeed because HL2 ep1/2 soundtracks used guitars. It also allowed me to go for a raw sound that fit well with Black Mesa. Most of it being old and dirty, (other than LC and QE) I wanted the music to reflect this.</p>

            <p>Speaking of that, was it done with so much guitar to make it more in-line with HL2? Or because it was something you personally wanted to do?</p>

            <p>It´s because guitars are awesome!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Honestly, I´m happy it turned out this way. I always loved HL2´s soundtrack a lot more because it was a bit on the heavier side and I always miss that when I play the original.</p>

<p>I am curious about this myself as well.</p>
<p>Also btw I really love Surface Tension 2.</p>
