    <description>By chance I found that having adaptive vsync enabled in nvidia control panel for Black Mesa was causing stuttering. I thought it was my medium powered gt730 causing the problem, but turning  adaptive sync off had a huge difference. Game runs very smoothly now. This is the only game/mod where I have seen this behaviour.</description>
