    <title>What Monitor Should I Buy?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-monitor-should-i-buy/12317</link>
    <description>Looking for a new monitor, 24-27 inches, 1920X1080. My budget is around 200-400, preferably on the lower end. My last monitor didn&#39;t turn out too well which is why I&#39;m asking here rather than just buying the cheapest 4+ egg monitor on newegg. What recommendations do you guys have?

Edit: currently looking at this guy:

            <p>Thanks for the tip, but I wound up getting a Samsung monitor at Best Buy for under $200. Great color depth and response time. Only has one HDMI port, so I’ll probably have to find a switcher for it, but otherwise it has very impressive visual quality.</p>

            <p>Why yes, I’ll necro this topic.</p>
<p>I’m looking for a monitor or TV myself, been reading up on the various LCD configurations on this <a href="https://reviews.cnet.com/monitor-buying-guide/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Cnet article.</a> Thus far, here is what I am looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At least 2, preferably 3-4 HDMI ports (to connect my laptop, desktop, PS3, and possibly an Xbox 360 Elite to)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard definition input jack, with a component extension to allow for RGB style HD input (from original Xbox 360 cables, in case I don’t get an HDMI capable version). The standard port should be able to support older generation consoles, such as the Dreamcast, PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube. Bonus points if I can run my Genesis off the thing (I have aftermarket component cables for the Genesis, but it only has mono audio output)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at least 22-24" for monitor size. I don’t want it to be too big, since price and desk/wall space is a concern. (my desk is 5’ long by 2’ thick. Currently, my laptop, CRT TV set, and PS3 take up a fair bit of this space)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option for a wall mount to preserve desk space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fast response time comparable to a CRT screen to preserve the gaming experience with a minimum of interface lag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good color depth that preserves black colors, allowing for accurate editing and color timing of high definition video</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-1080p (1920x1080 px resolution) at minimum, only going above this resolution if the price allows</p>
<ul>
<li>Some kind of screen protector, so I don’t have to worry about pixel damage if I swat flies on the display (This is kind of a dream feature, because I’m pretty sure there aren’t any glass-reinforced LCD displays. This is unfortunate.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any tips on finding a display like this in a modest price rainge? ($500-$700US)</p>

<p>Someone in that thread posted detailed instructions, I’ll have to try them out when I get the chance, I’ve been busy and haven’t yet.</p>
<p>EDIT: read through the thread, his solution is very subpar, how would I go about editing the EDID?<br>
EDIT2: What if I tried installing the G75’s motherboard driver?<br>
EDIT3: so by fiddling around I was able to get full res with perfect picture clarity using these settings:<br>
Resolution 2560x1440,<br>
Refresh Rate: 50Hz,<br>
Timing Standard: CVT-RB<br>
I have yet to test what happens when the laptop goes to sleep, and I don’t feel like doing it yet as I want to, at least for a moment, actually enjoy my monitor at proper res.</p>

            <p>No docking station available, I’ll start looking into driver hacks and such. Also I’m gonna try and come up with a way to confirm that the problem is on the laptop end and not the monitor end, not sure how ima do that yet.</p>
<p>Also Nvidia drivers for what? My 560m? I’m pretty sure it’s already running Nvidia drivers, I could try updating them.</p>
<p>EDIT: my friend’s asus g75 with the 660m ran full res just fine. This is bad.</p>
<p>EDIT2: <a href="https://forum.notebookreview.com/asus-gaming-notebook-forum/614960-2560x1440-output-g53sw.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forum.notebookreview.com/asus-gaming-notebook-forum/614960-2560x1440-output-g53sw.html</a><br>
Looks like someone got the asus G53sw to work, which is basically the same as mine. Now I just need to find out what he meant by setting a custom res. Kept, reading, this thread is a goldmine, wish I had found it sooner, going to try this out.</p>

            <p>Maybe your laptop has a docking station with a DVI port like mine does, all I had to do to get the dock was recommend the same laptop to a few people and eventually one gave me the dock because they didn’t need it.</p>

<li>Try installing NVidia’s drivers (instead of ASUS). Just make a restore point or something. Or do some googling and see how/if this has worked out for others.</li>

<p>OR</p>

<li>Harass ASUS until they patch their drivers.</li>

            <p>So I’m fairly fucked, 2560x1440 compliant HDMI cable, the monitor is supposedly 2560x1440 HDMI compliant, but when I plug the laptop (set to extend displays or display only on the big monitor) in it won’t give me 2560x1440. Do I have any options to try and force the resolution higher? All my hardware, as far as I’ve researched, should absolutely support this.</p>
<p>EDIT: went to my video Card’s settings and checked list all modes, 2560x1440 not on there, ):. Does this mean I am fucked?</p>

            <p>Many LG screens have a feature that is meant to address permanent burn-in or “ghost image” effect for their panels which basically consists of an almost invisible noise pattern (like for analog tv channels) always displayed in the background, and it’s usually pretty good at keeping functioning pixels alive too, so any dead pixels you have are probably a permanent issue.</p>

<p>Pixel-fixing software that displayed rapidly alternating noise patterns had no effect, but you might have better luck with it.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No bleeding, the backlight looks fine. I’ve looked into it and I know what the staticy appearance is, it’s an odd distortion effect caused by the monitors anti glare coating. It’s unfortunate, but subtle enough that I don’t particularly care. I recommend you look at this monitor in person before buying. I do not mind the static all that much but for a lot of people online it has been a deal breaker. Oh and it doesn’t move, it’s just like a bunch of tiny slightly multicolored dots.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed there are two stuck pixels, one green and one blue, near the outer edges of the screen. The pixels are so unnoticeable that I don’t think I’ll bother sending it back in. Do stuck pixels sometimes repair themselves with time? For some reason I feel like I’ve heard that somewhere.</p>

            <p>Well I got my monitor today and it’s fucking glorious. Lighter colors have this kinda odd subtle staticy effect, but I’ve yet to find any other complaints, and it’s not noticeable enough to be a problem. The difference in screen real estate is absolutely incredibly, especially since I was using a shitty 720p tv until the monitor showed up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my laptop is with Asus being repaired so it’ll be a while before I know if the HDMI will work.</p>
<p>Thanks for the recommendation Johnyo.</p>

<p>It’s the 560m which is apparently in the same tier as the 9800 gtx, but seeing as the former is a year old and the latter 5-6, and that I get noticeably better performance on the latter (the 9800 can’t play BF3 in 30+ frames, the 560m can), it’s probably a bigger difference than that. Then again my 5-6 year old cpu could be the actual factor.</p>

<p>Just make sure to test it with your/any laptop before the return period runs out. I’ve read bad things about mixing korean monitors with laptops due to the lack of built-in scaling. Can your laptop output 2560x1440? Then again, those were all DVI-D only, so with HDMI you’re probably fine.<br>
9800gtx should handle DVI-D just fine, but it’ll probably shit itself in games at the native resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes I’ll definitely test it. I contacted Asus and they said they’ve never tested an external monitor larger than 1080p so they don’t actually know. My laptop’s gpu and it’s port are both HDMI 1.4 so I’m hoping that’ll be enough for 2560x1440 output. If I can’t run this at native res I’ll just return it.</p>
<p>As for the 9800gtx, I figured as much. I may buy a new gpu or just use my laptop exclusively. Even on the newer laptop I’m prepared to turn the video settings way down in order to get 30 frames at the native resolution.</p>
<p>Also I’ve bought the monitor and it’s set to ship on the 7th, I’ll be back when I get the results.</p>

<p>I’ve heard reports that HDMI 1.3 is Qhd ready, but if you’re at HDMI 1.1 then you’re maxed at 1080p IIRC</p>
<p>forget about VGA (its max was supposed to be 1600x1200, but they extended it to 2048x1536 somehow), then your last option is Dual Link DVI, because single link will max out at 1080p just like HDMI 1.1</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m running HDMI 1.4, it looks like it’ll support 2560x1440, now I’m just looking at how the HDMI port on the monitor will handle it and whether or not there will be any severe bottlenecking.</p>
<p>EDIT: after a lot more research I think the monitor will work, I just ordered it. If things go wrong there’s always the microcenter returns policy. I’ll drop back in after I get it with how it came out. Unfortunately, my laptop is with asus getting repaired so I may have to wait a week or two before I can even test it out with my laptop.</p>

            <p>Dayummm dat resolution, thanks for the suggestion, I’ll see if I can find it off newegg or something (nvm looks like microcenter offers it online, not just in-store).</p>
<p>It has some super mixed reviews, makes me a little tentative to pay that much.</p>
<p>Also how do you think this will handle if I plug it into <a href="https://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/G53SX/#specifications" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">a laptop</a> (gtx 560m)? And my aging desktop’s 9800gtx?</p>
<p>Also trying to figure out if my laptop’s ports will handle 2560x1440, looks like the HDMI might depending on how new it is, looking into VGA support. As it looks so far, this isn’t gonna run with my laptop and I’m just gonna have to go with 1080p. Edit: looks like I’m definitely not getting it over VGA, further researching HDMI.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Looking for a new monitor, 24-27 inches, 1920X1080. My budget is around 200-400, preferably on the lower end. My last monitor didn’t turn out too well which is why I’m asking here rather than just buying the cheapest 4+ egg monitor on newegg. What recommendations do you guys have?</p>
<p>Edit: currently looking at this guy:<br>
