    <title>Who likes playing Tomb Raider?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/who-likes-playing-tomb-raider/12026</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! I like playing Tomb Raider, So since this is out in some months, I figured we needed a thread for it!
So what do you guys think about it? Does it need to be a game filled with a whole lot of mind-boggling puzzles like the previous games or an action game?
(It looks like an action game tbh but we&#39;ll see).</description>

            <p>i just wish the new game didnt sound like torture porn. I hate playing a game that I feel really self-conscious playing anywhere but when I’m home alone. God forbid a roommate walks in and hears <em>GASP MOAN SHRIEK</em> from lara. “No, it’s tomb raider, I swear! No, that’s my wallet in my pocket, I swear!”</p>

            <p>It is actually surprising how decent the games are, considering they could have just let Lara sell the games for them. Though I’ll admit I don’t have much to compare them to because lol console exclusives. Maybe I’m just missing out.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried the older games, but just like Maxey, I can’t beat them. I think it takes a completely different approach, cause the game mechanics have changed so much that all the puzzles seem counter intuitive to me now.</p>

            <p>I love Tomb Raider but I only beat the Crystal Dynamics’ games. I have played the original series’ games but never completed them.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to the new reboot game.</p>

            <p>I liked Tomb Raider 2 when I was younger, haven’t played it in years though. I still have the PC version, lost my PSX one tho.</p>
<p>I remember being so impressed at the “lighting effects” they used for underwater effects at the time, i. e. a filter and some scrolling textures</p>
<p>and sharks.</p>

            <p>The only one of the series I’ve played for any length of time was Anniversary. It was pretty fun. Graphics hold up quite well and the controller controls are fully mappable according to “button” assignments, rather than having the Xbox 360 controller being the only option. That alone gives the game high marks in my book.</p>

            <p>I don’t have any, but they’re quite spectacular from what I understand.</p>
<p>I’ve heard that the games aren’t half bad either.</p>
