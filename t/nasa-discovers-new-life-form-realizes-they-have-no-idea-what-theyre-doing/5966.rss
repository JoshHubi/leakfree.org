<p>Either way I find this pretty fascinating, but in no way a surprise. Its nice that scientific research is still advancing at a steady rate.</p>

</aside>
<p>Given that the bacteria were engineered to utilise the arsenic, why do you think they spend millions of dollars discovering anything? I swear, half the people posting in this thread haven’t the faintest clue what actually happened.</p>
<p>It’s not a) aliens and it’s not<br>
b) naturally occuring.</p>
<p>NASA have never said that our form of live is the only way possible in the entire universe so that’s plain bollocks as well. Sheesh, this generation is supposed to be more media savvy. It appears not to be the case.</p>
