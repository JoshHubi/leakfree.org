I tried restarting PC, download DirectX, Microsoft vcredist, run with -autoconfig,  -windowed -noborder launch option. Nothing worked. Please, help me.

I played Black Mesa a few years ago, maybe on Win XP, I&#39;m not sure. Since that i reinstall the system and changed graphics card, but nothing else.</description>

            <p>Nevermind, already solved:<br>
Solution: first delete from d3dx9_24.dll to d3dx9_42.dll inclusively from the System32 and SysWOW64 folders, and then use the DXUpdate utility to install the missing d3dx9_dll.<br>
It also helps with error 0xc000007b!</p>
