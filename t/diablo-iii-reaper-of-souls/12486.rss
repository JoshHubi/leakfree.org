<p>True.<br>
The lack of offline mode is the main reason I haven’t bought it - I played the beta and the lag in single-player seriously impaired playability.</p>
<p>Local co-op is an option that’d be nice to have if I do eventually get the game (an option which has sadly been missing in many PC versions of games, and seems less common even in console games as of 7th gen. I miss split-screen/shared-screen).</p>

            <p>The console versions also have updated boss encounters (new moves and different camera angles) and “power globes” essentially such as the healing ones, but these give temporary power-ups like shrines do, to make the gameplay faster and more interesting.</p>

            <p>those are pretty big things, though. also dodging is an incredibly cool feature, i never woulda thought it would be good for a diablo game but somehow it’s kind of awesome. I mean, in diablo 1 you could only walk, and it worked for that game because it was a slower-paced game anyway. However, with each game the gameplay has gotten more intense and fast-paced, so introducing dodge makes it feel kind of awesome, like god of war.</p>
<p>I still think d3 has a shitty story and poor design decisions, but I won’t deny the fun that comes with this console update. story and aesthetic-wise, d1 and d2 will always be superior, but if you consider d3 to be a total different game (which it kind of is, having been developed by a different team of people entirely), then it’s pretty great in that regard.</p>
<p>Plus, better loot on the console version. I hope they introduce more unique item stats though.</p>

<p>Paragon 2.0:</p>
<p>ACCOUNT-WIDE:</p>
<p>Paragon Levels are now account-wide, so whichever character you play, you will work towards the same Paragon Level.Paragon Experience can only be earned with level 70 characters.All Paragon Levels you have earned so far in Diablo 3 will be saved and converted into your Account Paragon Level when the changes occur. So you won’t lose any of your hard work. The more you play now, the better prepared you will be in the expansion.Each Account Paragon Level gives you one Paragon Point to spend.<br>
UNLIMITED PARAGON LEVELS:</p>
<p>There is no longer a level cap on Paragon Levels, meaning you will always earn new experience as you hunt for loot.At some point, however, experience gain is likely to get so slow, you will progress very slowly. But you will always progress.<br>
PARAGON POINTS:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Account Paragon Levels will award Paragon Points.Paragon Points are used to increase different stat points.Paragon Points that you’ve earned are accessible to all your level 70 characters.They can be reset and re-distributed in case you want to try different builds.You can place up to 50 Paragon Points in either of the stats described below, but each Paragon Point allocated is worth 5 in-game stat points, meaning 10 Paragon Points invested in Dexterity will reward you with 50 extra Dexterity in-game.<br>

<p>Now if you can quick switch I may consider it. Even then, it still got burned.

Not going to pre-order it this round… still wish I didn’t waste my $60 on that fucking game in the first place…</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention I have an intense hatred of the SPELL DAMAGE being based off of your WEAPON DAMAGE. It’s likely some of the stupidest shit I’ve seen. A FIREBALL OR HYDRA SHOULDN’T USE YOUR FUCKING WEAPON DAMAGE.</p>

            <p>Well, since the topic is about the upcoming expansion and not the vanilla, did Blizzard redeem themselves back a player or two? I’m not yet sold. I will decide if to get it or not according to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lore/story and shi*</li>
<li>the new skills, runes and pasives</li>
<li>if Act V is lasts longer than 2 hours<br>
The features sound promising tho and half them are for free in a patch.</li>

<p>Honestly, fuck Blizzard Irving. Blizzard North had it right, but that entire team disbanded in 2005, and they were the ones who made D2. You can tell these guys have no idea what they’re doing and butchered one of the finest gothic-medieval game series ever. It’s an absolute joke now, I mean for fucks sake, Azmodan is a master tactician for the armies of hell, and what does he do? Taunt the player every 20 paces with a contrived “MWAHAHAH! You may have foiled THAT plan, but you’ll never foil THIS NEXT plan!”</p>
<p>On top of that, they ruined the scary nature of Diablo himself by, once again, having him taunt you constantly. In Diablo 2, he spoke exactly one single line: “Not even death can save you from me” when you entered his sanctum. Pants-shitting, if you ask me.</p>
<p>But no, he just sends you to his “shadow realm” and tells you exactly how to get back out of it. I just hate the whole game and refuse to associate it with Diablos 1 and 2.</p>

</aside>
<p>I must agree. They turned serious and believable narrative into a fairy tale.<br>
But not everything about Diablo 3 is like that, there are still dark and mature moments and nods to Diablo 1 like the Skeleton King and Lazarus and Marius cameos, among many others.</p>
<p>Azmodan indeed is disappointing, not only he is the easiest boss fight in the game, but as you said the script… sucks. Even your hero makes fun of him, so it’s a joke of a joke in a joke. Act III is essentially a much worse remake of Act V from Diablo 2, nothing triumphs that perfection and Baal was memorable, he had this cruel humor around him: “Marius…give me the stone, and all is forgiven” gotta love that cutscene.</p>
<p>But I think people hate the game more than it deserves, it’s not all crap, but the quality noticeably decreases as you progress. The Archives-like dungeons in Act II. are too long and there are too many of them, so it’s boring, other than that, it’s a good one. The highlights are Covetous Shen and Belial definitely. The butterfly/mole cultist chick is just meh. Zoltun Kulle was anticlimactic as well, but I like the dialogue and his voice.</p>
<p>Acts III and IV are definitely rushed, the latter even not half finished I dare to say.</p>
<p>Other than lame Azmodan, shemale corny and cheesy Diablo, Angels aren’t a win either. They couldn’t do better than to reuse Izual, dude already defeated in previous game and Imperius…he should have been a boss fight instead.</p>
