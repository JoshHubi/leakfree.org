    <title>Broken &quot;Low Ammo&quot; Warning</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/broken-low-ammo-warning/15063</link>
    <description>Hi everyone.
There is something weird about the ammo display that I&#39;ve noticed since the steam release.

Both health and suit number values turn red when below 25%,  which is obviously useful in certain situations.
However, for some reason, the ammunition one does not.  It appears to be a bug of some sort as ammunition management can become quite crucial in BM.

I tried looking at some files (hudlayout.res) and oddly enough the ammo counter seems to be set up to behave just like the health and suit counters do, but it doesn&#39;t work.


I think it could be worth looking into it, as it seems like an easy fix.
Here&#39;s an example of how it looks like now:

Also, I&#39;d like to ask if the audio warning for low ammunition, which has been remastered and is present in the game files, could be restored at some point so that it&#39;ll work like it did in HL2.

            <p>I’m talking about the clip number, in the case of the pistol is the “17” not the “150”.</p>
<p>(Even though in the mod version both were affected.)</p>

            <p>Are you talking about the ammo amount inside the weapon (example: 9mm magazine), or the amount of ammo on the side?</p>
