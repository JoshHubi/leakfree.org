    <title>Second HL1 demo...?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/second-hl1-demo/776</link>
    <description>Ok, so this is my first post.

I just joined this forum after a four day arguement with both my brothers and about half a dozen other guys over what I called a &quot;bonus level&quot; of HL1.

They said it doesn&#39;t exist. I maintain they are mistaken.

We&#39;re all big Half-Life fans since Uplink came out and follow it religiously. But I remember a one-off mission coming out as freeware in about 98-99 where you&#39;re sent on a mission by G-Man to fight some renegade marines. They say it never existed.

Did I make this up? I hope not.</description>

            <p>Ookay. Now the deal is that the thing that you’ve searched for is real, but not from valve hence you’re going to lose the argument.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Yes, I remember something like that, too.<br>
With assassins and these little butterflies in it.</p>

            <p>I remember Half Life: Day One. Got the disk at GoodWill after I already had Half Life. Pretty disappointed to find out it was just the the first three and most of the fourth chapters, but I can see how it is probably one of the longer demos I have ever played.</p>

<p>It sounds a lot like a HL mod to me… There was one that I think was included with the HL: Generation CD, but I can’t seem to find it in wikipedia or the Valve Wiki. It was cited by valve as an “Official mod”, even though it was non-canon.<br>
The story seems to be like what you’ve mentioned, although <span class="bbcode-b">the first area has you fighting assasins.</span><br>
Hope that helps you a little, maybe you can get better google results from what I’ve said.</p>

<p>YES! That’s exactly what I remember. Now I can do some more specific googling. I love googling. Thanks for your help guys.</p>

            <p>You are making it up. The only demo was Uplink and some other demo which you got from an ATI video card. That one was just a bit of We’ve Got Hostiles.</p>
