    <title>Issues Noticed So Far</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/issues-noticed-so-far/9923</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to start off by saying thank you to everyone who contributed to the mod, fantastic work!

Here are few issues that I&#39;ve come across, a few may be prone to nostalgia:

[COLOR=&#39;red&#39;]-Screen Tilt resets to default value after quitting
[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]-Using fire button to initiative autoload will cause current weapon to fire upon loading
[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]-Keybinds will appear in the menu as reset to default after quitting but are in fact still bound to the players&#39; previous selections (movement controls in particular)

-Security guards stop firing when backed into a wall by enemy
-Security guards (Glock) deal too little damage
-Security guard teleported through a closed door, he then said &quot;that was arkward&quot; couldn&#39;t tell if was intentional or not

-Suit menu remembers which weapon you used last in the sub-category, I would prefer it to always default to the top weapon when bringing up the menu
-No visual que to tell you&#39;ve performed a duck-jump

-No HUD display for Tram speed selection
-Unnecessary visual circle que for health and ammunition
-Questionable threshold level for low ammunition red text
-357 crosshair too large for pinpoint accuracy shots

-Difficult to dismount ladders
-No option to automount ladders

-MP5 is stuck in burst fire mode
-Ammunition limits are too low, MP5, 357, etc.

-Soldiers do not fire in bursts, not compensating for recoil, and unfair punishment for player trying to move to cover
-Unrealistic reaction time for soldiers
-Unrealistic accuracy at longer ranges for soldiers
-Soldiers without masks still have the voice FX

-Sentry/Turrets deploy too quickly for the player to react
-Sentry/Turrets spot and fire at player too quickly

-Volume for footstep sounds on circletrack are too low
-Reload sounds don&#39;t always play, usually when reloading immediately after firing
-Chargeup sound for vort and houndeye difficult to distinguish

-Player gains too much momentum when running up stairs, causing them to fly off at the top

-Blast Pit tentacles are not properly distracted by sound (two would react to a grenade blast while one would continue to take random blind shots)
-Blast Pit tentacles able to push the player around without dealing damage

Suggestions:
-Option for Permanent Bullsquid ooze/blood effects on all weapons, removed when entering water</description>
