Crash at 2:44 Original description: This is unprecedented footage of a small airplane crash from inside the cockpit from two different views. Miraculously, everyone survived.

The pilot will make a full recovery and the rest of us escaped with
superficial injuries and feel very lucky to be alive . This trip was
much anticipated and due to our excitement we had our Gopro cameras
filming at various times. After flying up into the mountains for a hike
in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness we were planning on
flying to a small mountain town for dinner. Due to warming
temperatures we had a hard time gaining altitude. After taking off we
hit an air pocket that made us rapidly loose altitude, pushing us down
into the trees. Credit: outdoors to stay</description>

            <p>Yeah, I agree with Kaddo.  The pilot shouldn’t have flown with so much weight.  They took way too much time getting off the ground, and even then you could tell he was struggling to gain lift.</p>
<p>Sullenberger’s plane malfunctioned while in the air at no fault of his and he saved everyone’s life by landing in the Hudson.  This schmuck took off in less than ideal conditions and instead of turning around and heading back decided to go along and fly into a forest.</p>
<p>EDIT: That wasn’t any skill of the pilot that they survive crashing into the forest, it’s probability and statistics.  If you notice, they basically crash head on.  It’s only chance that they didn’t die.</p>

<p>Of course it was safe, the people just got out and started walking around with a video camera. Sure beats slamming into the middle of an icy river!</p>

<p>It’s the mix of altitude and heat. I hear parts of Afghanistan are similarly undesirable for flying.</p>

            <p>LoL, he definitely has to have his license removed. It wasn’t like that in the picture.<br>
Landed safely? Are you fucking stupid? The plane fell down like a paper plane because it flew through a hot air pocket. The pilot was only retarded enough to fly a plane with that hot weather. The air is very thin and the wings can’t produce much lift when the air is too hot. The engine also works uneffecient. You can see that right at the beginning. That idiot of a pilot forces the plane to go up although he even run out of runway. After that he still tries to climb but doesn’t get any altitude. What the fuck was the pilot thinking? Yeah sure, it will do. Just enjoy the view and don’t bother. Ever yprofessional pilot checks the air temperature before a flight and every pilot would have stopped the plane after they couldn’t lift off at the beginning.</p>

<p>Was it anything like this picture: <a href="https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=376_1344456110" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=376_1344456110</a></p>
