    <title>December Beta: Multiplayer Bugs and Opinions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/december-beta-multiplayer-bugs-and-opinions/15322</link>
    <description>Hello,
i played some rounds of the December Beta and found some Bugs i want to share.

I can see my Partner only in T-Pose and i cant see my Gauss Beam. After Validating the Black Mesa Files and a restart it was fixed until Black Mesa crashed. Then it was all Buggy again.
I want to mention i am not happy with the new longjump mechanics. it feels weird and very un-intuitive. But you can do backwards long jumps, is that planned?
I like the new Weapon Balancig and think thats the right direction.

Edit: You can also notice i have G-Mans Arm Model when selecting the Female Scientist as Player Model. And i select Face 4 and it jumps ingame to Face 1.

I recorded a bit of Gameplay and added some notes:
[youtube.com/watch?v=uHE21SypZII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHE21SypZII)

3:00 : I hear the sound of the Mp5 grenade lounch double when using it. Also happens to shotgun for me.

7:50 : Random crash of the game. Happend often to me only on dm_crossfire.

24:50 : A little cooldown of the crossbow would be a good balancing idea i think. Maybe just 0,25 seconds.

25:50 : Ditto. Just imagine a huge crowd and o would hit every single of them.

36:00 : Good example for loosing Stamina when you press jump in the air.

46:40 : Errr...weird thing with the Crosswbow scope here...

55:00 : The HUD says always i am 1st...but i am not.

59:45 : The MP5 Spawn on dm_rail is buggy, the Weapon spawns in the air.

1:04:55 : I first noticed the Shotgun Ammo is invisible. Happens on all Maps btw. Since my Partner cant see it too its a general bug i assume.

1:35:00 : The Gauss has a big beam..or cone...see for yourself in the Video.

            <p>Player being crushed by grenades, hornets while traveling elevators seem to be fixed, but needs more testing.</p>
<p>Trip-mines bugs/glitches are still present:<br>
Trip-mines placed behind ladder does not trigger or when placed on window, it will remain in mid-air when window is smashed.<br>
Also underwater trip-mines can’t be destroyed by explosive damage near it.</p>
<p>It was already mentioned somewhere, HEV batteries leaves glowing spot when picked, probably be fixed in next patch.</p>
