<p>When Black Mesa is finally released, what does that mean? The community–will it die out? No more funny threads with our favorite community? No more complaining about the mod not being released?

<p>i think this forum will still have alot of the fun stuff for sure. but i also think it will have other stuff. like alot of. “what did you do to get passed ??? part of the game” or “improvement suggestions” or a thread were you can tell about glitches or something. or mabey even a thread about how cool it is lol.</p>

<p>By the time this mod is released, everyone in the community will be dead from old age. So, what then? I guess there will be no what then.</p>
<p>Hey, does anyone remember that scene in the movie AI when the future found the boy AI at the end of the movie? I’m guessing that will be kind like what happens here. In 2246 a group of adventurers will unearth the DVD labeled Black Mesa and it will be so archaic that they will simply dismiss it and toss it out, since it will no longer be able to be played on any type of media, LOL.</p>
