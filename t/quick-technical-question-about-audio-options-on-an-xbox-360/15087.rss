    <title>Quick technical question about audio options on an Xbox 360</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/quick-technical-question-about-audio-options-on-an-xbox-360/15087</link>
    <description>So I was thinking of getting a replacement for my RROD&#39;ed 360 and need a quick survey of hardware versions. If you are able, please take a look in the system settings and check out if Video and Audio can be routed separately. What I would need to do to make this work is to have my video piped through an HDMI cable to my monitor and the L/R audio piped to my speakers, as both are currently hooked to a switch box to share with my PC and my PS3. If you can, take pictures of the options as well!</description>
