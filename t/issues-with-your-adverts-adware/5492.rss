    <title>Issues with your adverts - ADWARE!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/issues-with-your-adverts-adware/5492</link>
    <description>I see you have a new Advert bar at the top of your page, however one of the adverts is only 2 buttons saying download or play now.

Now seeing this for the first time i thought it was a joke you guys put up, so it takes you to a video link which then says you dont have &quot;xvid codec drives, so you need to download them&quot; dont fall for this.

it downloads Adware to your computer, and doesnt install anything but adware

Just thought i would give you guys a heads up

            <p>Last I checked, Source wasn’t on the  iphone, and didn’t support the gimmick of 3D “look stuff’s coming out at you” screens, and the mod isn’t released yet.<br>
So yeah, I guess I am. Though by all means, go ahead and prove me wrong, especially on the last one.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but it’s the same kind of ad, with a download/play button right on it, and I didn’t want to make a new thread when this one was right here.<br>
I also didn’t click the ad, because I knew it <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> have viruses attached.</p>

            <p>I realize this is a bump, but I’d like to report a similar ad;<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
This might be very misleading to the layperson, as not only will they think it’s done, but that it’s also 3D and on the iphone.</p>
