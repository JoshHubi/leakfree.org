    <title>Game Stuck During Startup/Loading</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-stuck-during-startup-loading/10346</link>
    <description>I installed the game today and installed the Source SDK 2007 thingy and when i click the Black Mesa icon in the Steam Library, it says preparing to launch and it does. Then it goes to the blurry loading screen like all source games but after like 10-15 seconds, the screen goes black. The cursor isn&#39;t spinning and nothing is going on, just black. I left it sitting there for about 5 minutes and still nothing so i am forced to ctrl-alt-del and end the task. I tried doing +map_background none and also -dxlevel 9.0 in the launch options but neither did anything. Other source games (hl2, css, and tf2) work fine for me and i&#39;m on vista 64 bit with an integrated intel chip. Please help, i&#39;m really looking forward to playing this awesome remake.</description>

            <p>ok, i found out that the only way to make it work is to do -window, but i really don’t want to play the game in windowed mode. is there any way to bypass this because when i change to fullscreen in the ingame options, it crashes…</p>
