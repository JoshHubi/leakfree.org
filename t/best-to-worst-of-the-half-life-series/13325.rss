    <title>Best to worst of the Half-Life series</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/best-to-worst-of-the-half-life-series/13325</link>
    <description>I wanted to start a little random debate/discussion on what you think are the best Half-Life games (gearbox expansions included) and worst and why you think that. Keep in mind this does not mean you need to think any of them are bad. If I had to order the games from best to worst my choice would be:
 1.Half-Life
 2.Half-Life 2
 3.Half-Life: Opposing Force
 4.Half-Life 2: Episode 2
 5.Half-Life 2: Episode 1
 6.Half-Life: Decay
 7.Half-Life: Blue Shift
 8.Half-Life: Uplink
 9.Half-Life 2: Lost Coast
10.Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
11.Half-Life: Source
12.Half-Life Deathmatch: Source</description>

            <p>I played the PC port of the Dreamcast version. It’s literally just the HD pack, but with some slightly different models and incredibly small map differences.</p>

<p>Plus you can still play chicken with that train on the Highway 17 bridge. The code updates on PC make that part impossible. (For the record I actually do own the Xbox port of HL2. Its more or less a 1:1 version of PC but with several modified maps due to the Xbox’s more limited RAM. There are also more load zones that had to be incorporated into the game due to memory restrictions. However, it’s quite a faithful port and is the origin of that orange spine cursor for when you play the game on PC with a controller.)</p>

            <p>Every once in a while I play the PS2 version, but I hate the sound quality, I hate the resolution, I hate the controls and it just doesn’t have the same nostalgic feel as the PC version. But I love using the cheat code that lets you play as a vortigaunt through the whole game. That’s what getsme to play it most of the time.</p>

            <p>I just noticed that I forgot that the PS2 and Dreamcast (DC pc port) versions of Half-Life are also a bit different, did anyone prefer those over the original Half-Life? I don’t much care for the DC version, but I liked the models used in the PS2 port (they had eyes and fingers and teeth!), and the new/recreated deathmatch levels.</p>

            <p>I dunno. For a long time I considered HL: Source to be THE Half-Life. When I wanted to play “Half-Life”, I’d always play HLS. With that in mind, I kind of consider it to be equal to if not better than HL, because it IS HL, but with a bit more stuff, and without taking away too much of what HL had. I feel like it wouldn’t even be proper to separate the two and consider them different games.</p>
<p>This point of view that I have probably comes from the fact that I had the luxury of being introduced to the Half-Life games AFTER HLS was released, so I don’t really have any hype or disappointments weighing down my opinion of the Source port.</p>

            <p>That and most of the people who were looking forward to it expected something like Half Life 2 or it’s episodes (I.e black mesa source) versus what was actually given to us.</p>
<p>Edit: <a class="mention" href="/u/daniel">@daniel</a>, the soldiers were holding that thing back already if I remember correctly. It had been poking it’s head out for awhile I think.</p>

<p>I’m rating HL: S as what I view it as. A remake (a very bad remake) Edit: Or even as a tech demo it’s still pretty bad</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But it’s not a remake. It’s a port. If any flowery term could describe it, it’d be a remaster…</p>
<p>but as a tech demo, It’s not even that bad. Not a lot of things got lost in translation. Overall it was a solid port, it’s just that the fact that it was a port cost it a lot of HL’s original charm.</p>

            <p>I do have to wonder why those guns were even set up in the first place.  Were they expecting some massive monster to come out of the portal?  Was the portal there before or after they set up the guns?  Was it merely a target range room before?</p>
<p>At least the Nihilanth fight was set up well; you navigate the alien environment, transporting from one location to the next while Nihilanth speaks (telepathically?) to you, before finally happening upon his (its?) chamber and having to use the weapons you have left to defeat him (it?).</p>

<p>Yeah, they were both pretty uninspired, but at least the Nihilanth was a little bit challenging.  You had to figure out to destroy the crystals and (if you were hit by a portal) navigate through the other rooms.  Plus you were jumping around on the trampoline-pads to get high enough to get a good shot at him.</p>
<p>But the gene worm was in a tiny room, with mounted machine guns that you just had to shoot at its eyes and then into its mouth.  Over and over.  It was neither interesting, difficult, nor fun.</p>

            <p>But really the most forced feeling boss fight was the Decay boss imo. It was basically one person shoots rockets while the other one shoots at alien grunts.</p>

            <p>Weird, I find monsters and weapons in Opposing Force to be better than in Half-Life, although Half-Life has better pacing, is longer and explores Black Mesa more, also more vent crawling, more friendly npc and so on. But yeah, in case of weapons and monsters, Opposing Force wins imo.</p>
<p>And I don’t find the boss at the end of Opposing Force to be no more forced than Nihilant is.</p>

<p>Half Life 2 was actually my first Half life game, and it was really a “wow” moment in my gaming development as far as shooters go.</p>
