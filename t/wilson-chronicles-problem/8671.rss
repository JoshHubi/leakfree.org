    <title>Wilson Chronicles Problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wilson-chronicles-problem/8671</link>
    <description>Hello again. I have encountered a problem with the Wilson Chronicles Demo Release 2. I have just downloaded it from Moddb and I was asked during the installation process what folder to save it to. I picked my Steam folder because most games work well on there. When installation was finished I clicked on Wilson Chronicles in my Steam folder and a drop down menu opened. DISASTER!!!:&#39;( The only option on the drop down menu was Uninstall Wilson Chronicles Demo. Da Da DAAAAAAAAAAA! I have Source SDK Base 2007 installed, plus Half Life 2 Episode 2 and the Portal 1 Demo. I don&#39;t know what to do. I was wondering if anyone has encountered this problem. This problem has lead me to believe that when I install Black Mesa (when it comes out, of course) that the same problem will occur. Did I insert Wilson Chronicles into the wrong folder or someother problem.

Answers and help would be much appreciated. :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Thank you. To all of you. I found out that I just had to wait a bit to download it to my Steam. And now I have completed the Demo. This means I won’t have any problem with downloading and playing Black Mesa once its released! This is my first HL2 mod yet. I am currently downloading my second. Its called Dangerous World, a mod set during the events of Half Life 2 Episode 1.</p>

            <p>Wrong forum, should be in help and support.<br>
You fix it by putting it on the Sourcemods folder in Steamapps in the Steam folder.<br>
Open up Steam and go to your game library, it should appear there.</p>

            <p>If you’ve installed the mod to your SourceMods folder, then it should appear in your list of games in Steam.</p>
