    <title>Sprint jumping y have you betrayed me</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sprint-jumping-y-have-you-betrayed-me/12184</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve tried sprinting while jumping in BM several times, and it&#39;s time to face facts - I can&#39;t. Is there a correct button combination? Because it just doesn&#39;t seem to want me jumping while sprinting.</description>

            <p>I can sprint+crouch+jump while also prop-surfing and brush-clipping in midair while using the crossbow aim to shoot a snark from 200ft away.</p>
<p>But seriously, it’s true that it could be your keyboard but also some keyboards have specific combinations you can’t do (like shift+up+left works but not shift+up+right) you could also download an auto crouch jump script somewhere on these forums.</p>

            <p>Maybe it’s a problem with your keyboard? Stupid ghosting. You could try changing your key setup, but I’m sure that;s not very ideal.</p>
