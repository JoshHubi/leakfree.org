    <description>Link to his tweet. [url]https://twitter.com/notch/status/246966935970000896[/url]

Why is this significant? Markus is a Valve fan, and as such has embraced the very core of Valve&#39;s success. Embracing the modding community with open arms. This very basic fundamental concept seems to be lost on so many developers. 


Thank you John Carmack. For inventing the wheel.
Thank you Valve. For giving the wheel immersion and physics.
Thank you Black Mesa Team. For giving us a revisit of these milestones, with graphic splendor.</description>

            <p>It is funny how much mindless egocentric rage gets thrown around on the internet lol. Although Notch’s enemies weren’t that creative, he did innovate terrain generation in a way that is totally unique, and he proved that graphics don’t make the game, which is something I strongly believe in. Also by making the game so open to supporting modders, he’s creating a stepping stone for countless possibilities of the imagination, something that most games don’t allow, and something that Valve does allow, hence why they’re such a great company in contrast to Nintendo and EA who aren’t about the community. Notch even goes out of his way to appreciate all of the minor mods done by the community and advertise them. In the end Minecraft is a time consumer like WoW or Habbo Hotel, but at least it offers the most important aspect of art in general, innovation.</p>

            <p>Wow, you guys go nuts when somebody gives Black mesa a negative. Then somebody nods to the game and praised it and you guys freak out about it.</p>
<p>And before insulting Notch, why not one of you try to do what he pulled off. It is not all about You let people have their f*****g opinions and stop hating on everybody’s opinion of Black Mesa. Notch is infact doing Black Mesa a great service, by just talking about it the mod will get a lot more players and support.</p>
<p>I sure hope the mods start laying down bans and dealing with these trolls and people who just can not think out any of the posts they make!.</p>
<p>Grow the F*** up!</p>

</aside>
<p>Don’t assume anything about other peoples age on the internet - you might (and most of the times would) be wrong :-). Back to the TFC - I’ve been playing original Team Fortress mod for Quake back in 1996. Then there was an original TF release for Quake World which gained popularity in the first half of the 1997. Then mod’s developers - Walker, Cook and Caughley - formed a company to create a commercial reimplementation of the mod using the Quake 2 engine. And only then Valve came in and bought this company altogether and the mod had been reimplemented using GldSrc rather than idTech2. That’s what my memory tells me about TF and the story of the TFC. I don’t see a lot of real innovation made by Valve here, it’s just a profitable money investition in a talented mod team, nothing more. TF had been invented and implemented long before Valve laid their hands on it.</p>
<p>Thus I find it a bit incorrect to claim TFC to be a product by a “Valve team modders” - it is Valve who hired <span class="bbcode-b">Quake modders</span> to make a commercial mod with their branch of the idTech1 engine. Anyways it’s a bit offtopic here really  so let’s just calm down and wait for another wave of Notch-haters to come and flame here :-).</p>

            <p>I’ve never played Minecraft, but I hear about it all the time from my friends. Maybe one day I’ll try it out, we’ll see.</p>
<p>But I don’t see why someone has to comment on the physical form of that developer or on his creations anyway? This is not the point here, caballeros.</p>
<p>Look at this like that: he has a lot of followers and friends. After seeing this message many of them will go and try Black Mesa out. Some of them will love it and will recommend it to their friends. And so on.</p>
<p>It surely won’t harm the Black Mesa, on the contrary, it will do the opposite. See?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>minecraft is a phenomenon. it’s about creativity: completely different from any FPS, and thus not comparable with BM.</p>

<p>so you dont enjoy minecraft, you enjoy the mods that other people made. something that has nothing to do with minecraft.</p>
<p>Notch wouldn’t even made minecraft if he never played infiniminer, also everything he added to the game was done already by other games. he never added anything new, never officially allowed mods. so what makes minecraft special.</p>

            <p>Actually the one thing that I liked about minecraft were the mods other people made for it. Alone the game got old quick unless you enjoy following mindless rituals like mining and farming, but the mods like “More Creeps and Weirdos” were really fun and creative. based on <a href="https://www.pentadact.com/index.php/2011-05-27-what-makes-games-good" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> of what a perfect game contains, minecraft does relatively well on each of the 6 aspects, but Black Mesa does better.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>that being said, the reason I don’t care about Notch is because, while he has made a popular game, he really has done nothing new and realistically doesn’t deserve the respect and fame he has gotten.

<p>as if anything notch says or does is significant. he’s just a lazy fat ass developer who tricked people into hyping his game by promising things he never kept or achieved.</p>
<p>i don’t understand why he is even talking about this when his own game doesn’t even support mods officially other than textures.</p>
