    <title>Steam Explodes as Word Acts Weird and Windows Takes &quot;Caution.&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-explodes-as-word-acts-weird-and-windows-takes-caution/4808</link>
    <description>A day or two ago, when I turned on my computer, it started to open up all the contents of the Steam folder. It&#39;s ANNOYING. Anyone know how to fix this? As soon as I delete all of this in the Startup folder, they add themselves again. And Steam keeps forgetting my username and password. I have no idea how to fix it. Can anyone help?

            <p>Quickly shut down the computer that has the problem, disconnect any wires from computer, dig a hole in your back yard, place the computer in the hole, cover with dirt and peat moss and never think about your computer again.</p>
