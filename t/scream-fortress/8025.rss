    <description>[url=&#39;https://www.teamfortress.com/bombinomicon/&#39;]Third Annual Scream Fortress Very Scary Halloween Special&quot;[/url]

Halloween costumes, spookified maps, and more.
Figured i&#39;d post this seeing how some people might be interested, despite all the negativity that TF2 has been recieving lately.

I think it&#39;s pretty cool and I always enjoy Valve&#39;s comics.</description>

            <p>Played it a bit this afternoon, didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I might. Despite having a sub-30 ping on each server I played on, the game still lagged really bad, though it never crashed. Too many people got bent out of shape about killing monoculus (there was one guy who would seriously tell everyone to stop fighting and kill the eye every single time he appeared, and would jump on anyone killing other players). Gifts are very hard to find/get to, as last time. All in all, it was ok, though I think I liked last year’s better.</p>

            <p>It’s been working marvelously for me ever since the initial halloween update (on, what, the 24th? cba to look it up).  Before that, I was getting “hl2.exe has stopped working” every half hour.</p>

Well, it seems like a good update, downloading now. Hope they have fixed some of the  crashes TF2’s been getting lately.</p>
<p>Seriously, I’m sick of it.   &gt; <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>I played through about 1000 hours of TF2 and then I sorta just stopped. I never once thought that anything ruined it, I was just…done. I still check out updates now and then, so I’ll probably play this for a bit anyway. Looks pretty good. Always like the comics too.</p>

            <p>I liked the idea of only wearing it when they allow you to, it makes it feel more special.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I can’t play on the event map because MY FUCKING INTERNET IS ON THE FRITZ</p>

<p>P.S. People are whining even NOW that “THEY SHULD REMOVE RESTRCTIONS I WATN IT TO WEAR AL TIME”. Jesus. No wonder TF2 artstyle/theme went down the drain.</p>
