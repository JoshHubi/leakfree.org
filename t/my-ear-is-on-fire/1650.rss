<p>btw, how does everyone get ear infections?<br>
i just can’t imagine!</p>
<p>anyway, there is a modern invention, called “headphones”, or, more likely, “earplugs”:<br>

            <p>OK. Now that the serious suggestion has been made, I don’t think you should listen to it, and instead try forcing the infection into submission with a power drill.</p>

<p>This whole thread has tons of fail pancakes in it. :facepalm:  SEE A DOCTOR NOW!</p>
<p>True story:<br>
A few years back, my hubby started to get panic attacks.  Bad ones.  But he didn’t realize they were panic attacks.  he thought he was having heart attacks.  He went to the emergency room 5 times in one year cuz he thought he was having a heart attack he was in so much pain.  Three doctors and a year later he finally got a hold of an ear doctor and he was tested.  It wasn’t his chest or heart, it was his equilibrium.  It was off so as a result he would get vertigo at high heights, panic attacks when driving over overpasses, and when driving in bumper to bumper traffic. (It didnt help when he worked 45 minutes from home + one very busy roadway during construction) He had a few other symptoms but those were the worst.</p>
<p>Turns out, my hubby had a flippin ear infection sometime in the last 5-10 years that was not taken care of properly.  The end result is that his equilibriam went goofy.  He failed the equilibrium tests miserably.  I mean, as in fall down like a drunk on one test!  Now he has to do exercises on a regular basis in order to get his head back on straight and to keep from having issues during driving.</p>
<p>So the moral of the story is to SEE A FLIPPIN DOCTOR!!!</p>

Ear infections can get pretty serious if you don’t treat them right.</p>
