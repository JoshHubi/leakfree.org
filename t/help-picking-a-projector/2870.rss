    <title>Help Picking a Projector</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-picking-a-projector/2870</link>
    <description>I want to set up a projector in my room to watch videos and play games on a big screen when guests are around. The distance between the projector lens and the screen is 60 inches, and the screen&#39;s dimensions are 84x76 inches and 80 inches on the diagonal. I&#39;m going for price not quality, and don&#39;t want to go over 300 dollars but if possible would like to go well under. I would like a remote, but if that is too expensive I can live without it.

This is the projector I&#39;m thinking of, it doesn&#39;t project a large enough image I would like, but it&#39;s enough.

Help appreciated.

Edit: this one looks good too, but I can&#39;t tell what distance they used when measuring the screen size.

            <p>Definitely go with the first one, it’s a much better deal. You may be disappointed with the screen size, but that’s the best you can get with an inexpensive LCD projector. Going to the next step up, DLP projectors, is significantly more expensive and probably out of your price range.</p>
<p>But LCD’s aren’t that bad. I have one and am pretty happy with it. Just don’t expect to get perfect clarity at 150 inches, they are slightly blurry at their max resolution. I’d check a couple reviews though to make sure that this particular model isn’t a dud though…</p>

            <p>The one with the cheapest bulbs, or ones that allow the bulb assembly to be dismantled so you only have to purchase the glass part of the bulb. Saves you a ton in the long run.</p>
