    <title>My ME3 ending story thoughts</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-me3-ending-story-thoughts/8574</link>
    <description>Alright so after a huge outcry from most of the Mass Effect community including me, I thought I&#39;d give my Mass effect trilogy ending. Contains SPOILERS..

basically as most of you know mass effects ending boils down to 3 options which don&#39;t satisfy most ME fans and here is what I would have done of i worked for Bioware.

Throughout the entire series your input changes your ME universe, and the ending to it all should be no less. Coming up to the final mins. Of mass effect as you ascend to the VI of the crucible, all your choices from past games and current should boil down to one defining moment of the commander. If you chose to be the paragon hero shep throughtout your journey you should get a choice of exclusive actions to take to destroy the reapers (one where you sacrifice yourself to save all species or find sleekly escape your impending doom), if you played a renegade bad ass shep you should get two exclusive renegade actions ( like going out in a blaze of glory or powering your way thru and possibly surviving) and if you played a character that didn&#39;t have sufficient points in either categories or you didnt play the past games you got the choice of either of the death paragon/renegade choices. (and possibly a ending where the reapers end up winning maybe?)

Furthermore if after the final moments of life or death I fell that you should be able to view your achievement/ actions of the galaxy that you saved and the aftermath of it all..

Anyways this is my thoughts on how it should have been giving players many opportunities for replay value throughout all the games and satisfying the majority of players</description>

<p>Well obviously not, that would have made sense.</p>
