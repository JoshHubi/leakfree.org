<p>Good news, i suppose.</p>
<p>The problem is Windows 8 and the fact that Steam software needs to write in Program Files folder. I solved it by running Steam as administrator, but I suppose when you install Steam you could place it somewhere else than C:\Program Files folder.</p>
<p>I guess when someone is running Win7 on user/guest account, it could end up with same issue.</p>

            <p>No problems at all, I just installed Steam, downloaded the engine needed (from link in this forum), but BMS into folder and run it. And this happened everytime, I tried to restart the game and steam three times, but always it stucks after train ride.</p>
