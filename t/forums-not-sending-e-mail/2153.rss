    <title>Forums not sending E-mail</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/forums-not-sending-e-mail/2153</link>
    <description>I just made an account recently, and yesterday I forgot my password, so I went through the steps to have an e-mail sent to me. The only problem is, it never got sent. I pressed send/receive dozens of times waiting for it, and it still hasn&#39;t come. I don&#39;t get why it isn&#39;t sending me the e-mail for it. (I finally logged in now because I tried every password I&#39;ve ever used, so yeah :| )


does anyone know why it won&#39;t send the e-mail?</description>
