    <title>AutoRun Stopped working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/autorun-stopped-working/1061</link>
    <description>Can anyone explain to me how autorun just stops working? 

I mean I never pressed anything to disable it, I even checked regedit to see if a virus switched it to 0, but no, the value is still set at 1.

Arrrhhhhhhhhhboggygoogglymooboo...


It be doing me head in. 

Also the autorun function in the properties of the cd drives has disappeared too :&#39;(</description>

            <p>Check if you have an autorun.inf in the “files ready to be written to CD” folder. (delete it if you find it)</p>

            <p>Autorun can be disabled as a whole, and by drive type, and by drive letter - use TweakXP to see what these are set to.<br>
I also recommend disabling it anyway so you don’t end up with annoyances like Sony rootkits or annoying custom DVD player software being installed without your permission.</p>

            <p>The portable hdd’s the cd roms/dvd roms, pen drives, insertible hookers &amp; etc all won’t show up on autorun, like they’re there, you have to go into my computer and access them, but its gets tiresome you know.</p>

            <p>Could you be less precise sir? This is way too much info right there, I can’t analyse it all.</p>
<p>Did they stopped showing up when you put a CD in? Are they screwed up (can’t press buttons, that kind if stuff)? Need moar info</p>
