    <title>Computer shuts down and fan goes crazy</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-shuts-down-and-fan-goes-crazy/6944</link>
    <description>So I have a Radeon HD 6970 card here, and the computer has recently begun shutting down in the middle of games (particularily AvP) and sending the vid card fan absolutely crazy fast/loud. I&#39;ve tried manually setting the fan speed in catalyst, I&#39;ve updated the video drivers, I&#39;ve cleared every last spec of dust out of the computer. It&#39;s NOT a heat issue. It&#39;s not putting off any heat after a shut down, and is constantly at 35C on startup. 

Any ideas what is going on? Should I set its memory usage or something back? I have no bloody clue.</description>

            <p>Also temps drop very quickly once idleing again, it takes a few seconds for the temps to drop back to normal. As the fans are going into overdrive and the computer shuts down it looks to me like overheat protection.</p>

            <p>Some machines run the cooling fans at 100% duty cycle when booting (mine does and its goddamn loud!) before they chillot and go slower.</p>
<p>Are you SURE its only the video card that starts running faster? And that it hasn’t decided to restart? Have you tried leaving the system running for a few minutes after the crash?</p>
<p>Try “Speccy” from Pirifom to get all your system info/temperatures, I use a few of their programs. Only problem is it seems your entire system seems to shut down? No crash to desktop/BSOD, just black screen? If it does then you won’t be able to get hold of the immediate temperatures.</p>

            <p>I’ll find the specs in a bit/while, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As far as I know, it shuts down (as in everything is off) EXCEPT for the fan which is on the video card), which then goes full drive untill the power button is pressed. (which shuts the computer down proper)</p>
<p>if it is a heat issue in the vid card (which is where the phsycofan resides) then there is some bloody amazing alien technology that instantly cools the sucker down to 35C in the time it takes to start the computer up or open the case.</p>
<p>I’m going to try another video card in there, and see if it is actually the vid card that is causing the problem. I had almost the same problem with my other machine excepting the evil screaming devilfan, and it just needed some voltage control tinkering in the bios.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work I’ll get back to you guys, I appreciate the help/willing to help in spite of my lack of info retardations.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>This.  In a question relating to this - do the games CTD (crash to desktop), or cause a BSOD, or just freeze on the last rendered frame?  You said shutting the computer down and causing the fan to go nuts - in that order?  Or does the fan spool first, then the PC restarts automatically?</p>
<p>Things we need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remaining hardware specs</li>
<li>O/S (and 32 or 64-bit?)</li>
<li>What other games crash?</li>
<li>Any messages in eventvwr.msc? (Start–&gt;Run–&gt;eventvwr.msc, check for Windows–&gt;Application and System logs)</li>

            <p>It sounds very much like an overheating issue. I would suggest downloading and running rivatuner and Coretemp (for GPU and CPU respectively) and get them to log your temps while you play some games until it crashes.</p>
<p>Once back to windows consult the log. If the CPU is reaching 75/80c then it’s probably the issue. If the GPU is reaching 90c+ it’s probably the issue.</p>
<p>Disable automatic restart on system failure in order to receive a BSOD. Note the code and that should help us fault find a little more.</p>

<p>Good fucking luck.<br>
AVP is number one on my list of games that, “fuck over computers”.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Trying to get that game to run smoothly without crashing my PC was a total fucking nightmare.<br>
I wouldn’t be surprised if the game itself did permanent damage to your PC. That game, no matter how fun, runs on the worst combination of engine physics and graphics. The engine combination they use is the equivalent of running Crysis on a toaster.</p>
<p>Regardless, if it’s happening with other games, than I’m at a loss.<br>
But I just had to say something, because I gave my screen a shower due to massive laughter to the game you mentioned – good luck.</p>

            <p>Stock, the most I handled it was to take it out of the box, and to re-set it into the computer in case it had been plugged in wrong.</p>
<p>Is there a way to check the heat spreader/set it right?</p>
<p>(ohmygoodnesswhatisaheatspreaderevenlookslike)D:</p>
<p>EDIT: OH WAIT, is the heat spreader the little number sitting on the CPU?</p>

            <p>Stock cooling, or did you fiddle with it. Same exact issues happened with a friends system and the problem was the heat spreader wasn’t making full contact.</p>
