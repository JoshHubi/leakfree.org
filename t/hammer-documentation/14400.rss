    <description>Would it be possible for Crowbar to try and put together documentation for how to use the various BM entities in Hammer, such as the OaR tram, garg, osprey, abrams, and apache? It would greatly help prospecting mappers if they want to make use of them. There is some information on the Apache since I asked about it once, on the leak-free threads, but official documentation would help clear up any confusion as to the differences from HL2 coding of the BM-specific entities (i.e. apache vs hunter-chopper).</description>
