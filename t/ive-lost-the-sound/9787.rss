    <title>I&#39;ve lost the sound.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ive-lost-the-sound/9787</link>
    <description>Okay, so I was playing, reaching the part when the vortigaunt appears for the first time. And then the sounds shut down. I don&#39;t have sound in Windows anymore. It sounds pretty fucked up, I know. Maybe if I restart the computer I have sound again. I haven&#39;t tried yet, anyways, that&#39;s a weird bug, isn&#39;t it?</description>

            <p>Okay, so this must sound retarded. I actually turned downed the volume of the loudspeakers accidentally with my foot, but I didn’t realise until now. SORRY.</p>

            <p>Yes, there’s no sound even after restarting the computer. Something strange happened.</p>
<p>P.D: You’ll think that this doesn’t have anything to do with the game. Actually before that happened the game froze for a second, so I think it’s really got something to do with my issue.</p>
