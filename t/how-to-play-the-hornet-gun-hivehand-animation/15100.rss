    <title>How to play the Hornet Gun/Hivehand animation?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-play-the-hornet-gun-hivehand-animation/15100</link>
    <description>So, in the tripmine part of Surface Tension (map file is [i]bm_c2a5[/i][i]e[/i]) the player gets the Hivehand, and there&#39;s a funny animation playing with a guard&#39;s reaction to it.

[b]Guard&#39;s reaction is triggered choreography, however, I don&#39;t know how to trigger the player/Hivehand animation. If I just put it in a level, there&#39;s no special pick-up animation.[/b]

On the [i]bm_c2a5e[/i] level, this is what I found, but doesn&#39;t solve my issue at all (or I&#39;m too blind to see the solution):

I&#39;ve noticed that there&#39;s a target entity called [i]c2a5e_hivehand_pickup[/i], but I don&#39;t know what it is; seems to be invalid.</description>
