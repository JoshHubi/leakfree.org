    <title>episode 2: cannot see water surface/directx 81 trouble</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/episode-2-cannot-see-water-surface-directx-81-trouble/944</link>
    <description>I have two issues:


1. water surface is missing, underwater looks fine.

2.running lower than directx 9 crashes episode 2.

I have been looking for a solution to these problems for a while, any help would be very much appreciated!</description>

            <p>Well, that is bad news! I figured if I could see some effect from below… oh well, I guess I will just deal with it. (I am determined to get the Little Rocket Man achievement) Even with the water in this state, It will still be worth it. Thank You for being kind.</p>

            <p>I believe the problem lies with rendering water reflections, which is expensive. When you are underwater, reflections on the surface aren’t drawn.</p>
<p>Episode’s 2 Engine is extensively modified from that of HL2 and Episode 1 and requires a better system to run. It’s commonly referred to as the Orange Box engine (the real name for it is the Source 2007 engine). Garry’s Mod uses this engine too.</p>
<p>I don’t think there is any real solution to fix it using the card you’ve got. Just use whatever settings work best I suppose.</p>

            <p>I am using a Compaq Presario SR5350…  I have actually played through episode 2 a few times on it. I just do not understand why it crashes at a lighter Directx/why I can only see the pretty water when I am in it looking out. I have no problem with the water effects in Half-Life 2 or Episode 1… I was just wondering if someone could help me out with one of the issues I am currently having. If it was the water making Episode 2 crash wouldn’t it crash when I was underwater looking out too? I know I need a new graphics card. In any case, Thank You for trying… Does anyone recommend another place that may be able to help? I have the same water trouble with Garry’s Mod…</p>

            <p>I think you’ll find the reason for it is because… It’s not a supported GPU.</p>
<p>I’m presuming you are using a laptop, and that’s why you have an Intel 945 which is an integrated GPU that’s built into your motherboard.</p>
<p>It’s not meant for gaming… and I expect that’s the problem. It doesn’t have its own memory, so we’re talking about quite limited capabilities, so it’s no wonder why you’re having problems.</p>

            <p>well, I guess I am glad that you almost know what I am talking about! It seems like it would be an easy fix though. I thought that might be the case with directx 8 crashing but, if steam does not say anything… I am thinking it has to be something on my end. I guess I will start googling again…</p>

            <p>I must’ve heard wrong then. I feel your pain though. I once had the same problem. Or now that I think of it, it might have been like that only in hammer.</p>

            <p>I have an Intel 945… I am pretty sure that all of my drivers are updated though.<br>
steam support says that episode 2 will run on directx 8 or higher. I can deal with slowdown, it is just the invisible water that is really irritating.</p>

            <p>I’ve heard that support for anything lower than dx 9 was removed from episode 2. So if it works good for you, but if it doesn’t, like it is the case now, nothing can be done.</p>
