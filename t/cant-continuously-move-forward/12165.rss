    <title>Can&#39;t continuously move forward</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-continuously-move-forward/12165</link>
    <description>Hello,

First of all this is a great game thank you!

The problem I am experiencing involves motion in the game. After ~5 minutes of play when I hold down any of the motion keys (wasd) it will only work continuously for a small period of time before the player stops moving and the game starts to make a noise similar to a button being pressed. After releasing the key and pressing it again it works for another short interval. 

My question: Is this an in game problem and if so is there a fix?
 
If not, any idea what it might be on my end?

Thanks again!  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>By default, wasd are movement keys. The game doesn’t make any noise when those buttons are pressed. Are you using a wireless keyboard? I’ve had those kinds of issues before using them.</p>

            <p>This is definitely a problem on your end, press start and type “change how your keyboard works” then turn off all the features listed and also disable the shortcut keys. Also on some keyboards you can press 3 keys at once but only for some keys, other keys stop working when you hold down 2 keys, I dunno if that clears it up.</p>
