    <title>Models just disappear after being killed</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/models-just-disappear-after-being-killed/10089</link>
    <description>Hello,

instead of becoming a ragdoll, enemies just bury into the ground after being killed (as if they had no clipping). I am located in germany, so I thought it might be a built-in Source low violence-thing, but none of my friends are experiencing this, one of them even downloaded it from shacknews, like I did.

I tried:
-re-downloading and re-installing both, game and SDK bases

-g_ragdoll_fadespeed 0
-g_ragdoll lvfadespeed 0
-cl_ragdoll_physics_enable 1 (does not seem to be a cvar in BMS)

I did a .md5-check and it sais there&#39;d be a CRC-error in the .7z-file. But, as I said, I re-downloaded and don&#39;t know why only my version should be broken...

Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s of any interest, but other physics-related stuff, like barrels, coffee-cups etc. work as intended.

Please tell me there&#39;s a fix, it really scks and kills the atmosphere. Ideas?

EDIT: I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s a fade-issue, because they don&#39;t fade, but bury.</description>

<p>Im having same problem…Iam from germany. Is it really because some other steam games are cut in my country?<br>
There must be another fix for that. I dont want make a second steam account only because this  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Please someone of the black mesa Team have a look here and reply. Im sure they can find a fix for it.</p>

<p>Hey,<br>
It just needs 5 minutes. Register a new steam account and play BM uncensored right away. You do not need to install SDK + BM again, its already there. Not optimal but faster than using Bloodpatches or bunches of console commands every week because steam decides to replace altered files.<br>
I can live with a second steam account.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Easy fix. Create a new dummy steam account (that means: An account that has no games yet, especially no censored source games) and play BM with this dummy account. BM should appear there without reinstalling everything. Even your savegames and settings are there. Worked for me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Edit: And I was half through the game when I have found this tip. Argh…</p>
<p>Btw, greatest mod of all time, the Devs really deserve all internets  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I did an MD5 validation myself when I downloaded BM and there were no errors.  Try downloading using the torrent (if you point it to the directory where the MD5, 7Z, and EXE files are it should only download corrupted or missing pieces).</p>
