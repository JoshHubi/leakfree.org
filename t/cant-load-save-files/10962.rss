    <title>Can&#39;t load save files</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-load-save-files/10962</link>
    <description>I was playing in a new area and was stuck, so decided to go back to see if I missed something. This triggered the game to load the old area. This took longer than normal, about 5-8 minutes, so I decided to exit the game and reload it. Well now I can&#39;t seem to load any recent saves that I have. The most recent save I can load is from hours ago. I&#39;d rather not replay all that again, is there a way to fix save files?</description>

<p>I am also experiencing this issue with a number of saved games, saved both via Quick Save and via the Save menu. Are not that many people experiencing this? Seems like a major issue. Seems like the save games are working until I quit Black Mesa, then no longer work when I start it up again. They’re being corrupted somehow. I brought up the developer console for diagnostic messages, and it reports that " is not a valid save game file!". I did nothing myself to corrupt said file, so it must be a bug in the game.</p>
<p>Any of the programmers looking into this? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Try going to you steamapps\sourcemods\bms\cfg<br>
folder</p>
<p>If you look in the config.cfg file for sv_unlockedchapters<br>
&amp; change the number in the quotes that follow, this will allow you to start in other chapters, I think you will end up with base weapons rather than what you would have had from natural progression.</p>

<p>Yeah, I figured as much. I was hoping there was some sort of documentation that I’d be able to look through and try to fix it myself.</p>

<p>AFAIK you’re expected to be able to “start up a new game” only with maps having letter “a” as their last symbol, i.e. using something like “map bm_c1a1a” would place you into a new game with a base set of the weapons you’re expected to have at that point of the game. Also you could simply use a new game menu and select a chapter you want to start playing from. Hope that would suffice your needs.</p>

<p>During all the attempts to reload my corrupt save files I didn’t even think about looking at the unlocked stages. Turns out I can start not to far off where I was. Thanks a lot for your help.</p>

<p>Well that’s unfortunate. If it helps at all, I am a programmer and do feel comfortable fooling around with “hidden” files and the like. I’ve mostly stuck with quick saves, although I do believe the file I can load was a manual save.If there really is no other way then is it possible at all to just unlock all the levels without running through them all? Just so I can start as close as possible to where I was before.</p>
