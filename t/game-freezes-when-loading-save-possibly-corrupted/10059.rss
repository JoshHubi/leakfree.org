    <title>Game freezes when loading - save possibly corrupted?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-freezes-when-loading-save-possibly-corrupted/10059</link>
    <description>So, I was playing Black Mesa, and it froze while loading during the chapter Surface Tension. But now, whenever I try to load a game from the main menu, it never finishes! I&#39;ve tried this with multiple saves, and it keeps happening. What could&#39;ve caused this?</description>
