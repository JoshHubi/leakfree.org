    <title>Weapon not bobbing while sprinting</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weapon-not-bobbing-while-sprinting/10791</link>
    <description>Hi all! This is more of a visual issue more than performance, but after beating the game for the first time,  I started watching other playthroughs on youtube. In those ones, whenever the player sprints their weapon bobs up and down, simulating the movement of running and speed. However, in my game, whenever I sprint the active weapon just lowers and stays still. Has anyone else experienced this, or is it just me?</description>
