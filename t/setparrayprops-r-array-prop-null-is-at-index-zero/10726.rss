    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/setparrayprops-r-array-prop-null-is-at-index-zero/10726</link>
    <description>So I was playing this awesome game, had a few problems but i manage to fix em. Yesterday it was awesome, i played for like 2-3 hours. Today when I start the game it said - &quot; SetpArrayProps_R: array prop &#39;(null)&#39;is at index zero. &quot;

Dunno why, and i can&#39;t find the answer. I have all of Valve games and I use 

		SteamAppId 220
		ToolsAppId 211

Please help, wanna play this awesome game &gt;_&lt;
