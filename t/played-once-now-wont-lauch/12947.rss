    <title>Played once, now won&#39;t lauch :(</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/played-once-now-wont-lauch/12947</link>
    <description>Alright... I was able to play the game it was working and everything. Turned off my PC and then when i started it back up again and went into steam clicked on the game icon clicked play... nothing happens. Game doesnt even open. I followed the instructions on installation seeing as i was able to play the game only once. Got pretty far but now game wont launch :[ 

I searched through the forums some tried some of the solutions that i was able to find and still have the problem.

Pc Specs:

AMD phenom II x6 multicore
Windows 7
NVidia GTX 650 1G
8G Ram
2 Disk drives (700 - 800 Gig. total)

Any thoughts??

Thanks  :smiley:</description>

            <p>It seems as some people have recently been experiencing problems while trying to play third-party mods on steam, Valve probably broke something again.</p>
<p>To rule out this possibility, it would be great if you could try to start any other third-party mod if you have any.<br>
You should also try to verify integrity of the file cache for the <span class="bbcode-i">Source SDK base</span> packages. To do this, go to the tools section in your steam library tab, right click on the corresponding <span class="bbcode-i">Source SDK Base</span>(I’m not sure which one Black Mesa uses, it’s either 2006 or 2007), and go to properties. There you choose the local file tab and click on "<span class="bbcode-i">Verify integrity of tool cache</span>. When the check have been completed, try to launch Black Mesa.</p>
