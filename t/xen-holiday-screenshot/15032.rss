    <description>[b]Happy Holidays![/b]

The team remains, as always, hard at work on Xen! Currently our specific focus is on gameplay: crafting a fun and cohesive experience from start to finish. We want our version of Xen to feel like it really belongs with the rest of the game in terms of mechanics, cohesion and progression. But we also want to push the boundaries and explore this unique and varied setting; to build an experience that feels both fresh and familiar to players from all walks of Half-Life veterancy. While our Xen is certainly going to be gorgeous, we are first and foremost really committed to making sure that the gameplay works on every level.

To give a bit of an exciting tease into what we’re doing at the moment, and as our own little holiday gift to you lot, please enjoy our first ever publicly released screenshot of Xen!

[align=center][img=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/9ruvLbv.jpg&#39;,none,1024][/img][/align]

We will have more media for the community in the coming months, as well as more detailed updates as to how we are progressing. Right now we are up against a tough deadline, but we are committed and excited to work towards it and to finally unveil the definitive Black Mesa experience for everyone to enjoy.

Be kind to each other out there, and again, have a happy holiday!</description>

<p>Speaking of that, i find it a bit ironic that Kevin voices both the security guards and Gman and that Shapiro does the same.</p>

<p>Well, he’ll be voiced by the same guy who plays the security guard, and if you’ve heard his Gman impression in the official live stream before, you’ll know he’s gonna be awesome.</p>
<p>I do wonder though how the transition between Nihilanth’s death and the ending tram will go.</p>

            <p>I had some fantasy about how it could be handled sometime ago. A little bit of a departure from the original, but i found it amusing.</p>
<p>"You wake up on the floor of the Nihilanth’s chamber. Rubble is strewn about, paralleling the test chamber following the resonance cascade. However, the destruction has revealed a new passageway, an elevator sitting at the end. With no where else to go, you enter the glass pod. The doors close behind you and it begins to descend. Shortly, the narrow shaft opens up into a portion of the factory. You can see Vortigaunts as they break their chains and then turn to you as you pass, giving an expression that seems like respect or perhaps gratitude. The shaft narrows again to fit the elevator.</p>
<p>You hear someone clearing your throat behind you. When you turn, the g-man is standing at the other end of the pod. He gives you a bemused look and then begins to speak."</p>
<p>[insert original Half Life scene here]</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that it will happen anything like this, but whatever!</p>

            <p>I kinda like how it looks like an earthly ocean environment, because well, when you think about it, oceans are pretty alien-y to begin with, with pretty alien-looking inhabitants to boot.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I just wonder what the factory levels will look like. Will there be more of a mesh between organic and tech? or something completely different? I can’t wait to see!</p>

<p>We/I never said it was a forest, forest is a max plug-in. I’m not defensive in the least. Everybody is welcome to their opinion, but basing it off 3 pictures is absurd or not liking it due to a color.  I don’t have to show any images to back up my claim. We have been releasing sneak peaks not whole level shots.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Eh it looks more like a jungle from that Avatar movie, those palm plants or whatever they are remind me of the swamps from Halo. But who cares, as I said there are mods so it’s not like we’re stuck with this, and it might actually be good idk.</p>
<p>Nah pretty sure you are defensive, even the smallest hint that someone dislikes something or even if it has nothing to do with liking or disliking and people just point out how the level looks to them and you storm to the comments to call them absurd for saying it reminds them of an ocean or that the color scheme is interesting. And yes color scheme matters, imagine if you made the canyons around Black Mesa green.</p>
<p>“I don’t have to show any images to back up my claim.” Then you should maybe stop getting upset over every comment speculating.</p>
<p>Overall yes it looks like a coral reef, yes the color scheme is different, no it doesn’t mean it’s bad or that people dislike it, and yes people are talking about the screenshot/area and not the whole of Xen. Get over yourself. Eat a pizza.</p>

<p>Unless you show images of level’s  that aren’t so influenced from ocean life (which you seem to refuse to do) then it’s easier to assume that levels differing from earthly inspired caves and coral reefs won’t be too common.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>CC said we will see more alien-ish levels in Xen and there will be more crazy levels than it was in original so it makes sense they won’t showing you their main features yet.You will start from said “caves” and then you will see more and more stuff which are diffierent from Earth so I’m already happy bcs they showed us something similar to alien forests.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I never said I wasn’t happy though, I just explained why people where throwing assumptions (only earthly inspired levels shown). Though in my humble opinion the “forest” we were shown didn’t look too alien either but as I said there are mods for that.</p>
<p>Anyways if you’re going to post images on the internet you shouldn’t be surprised that people would speculate on the content based on the things that are shown. If you don’t show images to counter those speculations then it’s your fault.<br>
It’s like If I  made a model of a vehicle using a car as a reference only to get upset for no reason when people tell me that it looks like a car. Plus from what I’ve seen most people comment on the image and not Xen as a whole (in a respectful manner mind you). This kind of behavior makes you look desperate for approval.</p>

<p>Your sneaky front vs back comment combined with Chon’s more forward “has anyone not even compared the instagram with these new screenshots” before a couple of smarties figured it out. Good job.<br>

<p>CC said we will see more alien-ish levels in Xen and there will be more crazy levels than it was in original so it makes sense they won’t showing you their main features yet.You will start from said “caves” and then you will see more and more stuff which are diffierent from Earth so I’m already happy bcs they showed us something similar to alien forests.</p>

<p>I get it takes a lot of time to do all the art for the levels but you seem really defensive, it’s not like the community is attacking you, if anything they are trying too hard to appear kind as to not upset you.</p>
<p>People speculate the general art direction for the levels because that’s the only kind of images you seem to share. Plus there are plenty of images already, from the cave to the 3/4 screenshots recently shared to the thread you recently made where you included even more images and models, there doesn’t seem to be any examples backing up your words that the levels are not just all inspired by earthly coral reefs and generic caves.</p>
<p>The images you showed in your recent thread only seem to backup the speculations that Xen has a lot more in common with Earth’s vegetation and life than the original. Unless you show images of level’s  that aren’t so influenced from ocean life (which you seem to refuse to do) then it’s easier to assume that levels differing from earthly inspired caves and coral reefs won’t be too common.</p>
<p>Of course I would love to be proven wrong either when the levels are released or with an image from a “weird/fantastical” level you claim to have but won’t share.</p>
<p>=============================================================================================================================================<br>
Still the levels shown are nice, definitely pleasant to look at. I’m sure that when Xen comes out there will be mods that change the models to something more exotic anyways (might even swap models from some Xen mods into the game myself).</p>
<p>tl;dr: “I am amazed that with all those many maps in Xen you have yet to show any varied screenshots”.- Vladimir Putin</p>

            <p>Personally I am loving the colors and feel of it. I know I saw someone say something about it having too much coral, but I like it. I like it a lot. The original hl xen was all in green tones. I was so very much hoping that they would consider changing the color scheme a bit and it looks like they did. So for me, a big two thumbs up on the progress of the final chapters!</p>

            <p>The analogy would make more sense reversed really. We as early access customers are working to help find bugs and weak portions of the game, which allows us to better communicate what we want to see. In return, the developers “pay” us with a better game for everyone.<br>
Just thought I’d give my two cents on that, I’m outie unless we get back on-topic.</p>

            <p>What did I say earlier about keeping this discussion on topic? I’m serious. Bans are coming if this carries on.</p>
<p>On another note, we are adults, we can take criticism and pestering. We appreciate fans helping stand up for us, but don’t worry - we can speak for ourselves. It’s okay, not a problem really.</p>
<p>A pedantic note - customers are not the boss. They are customers. There’s absolutely no need for an analogy there. It always aggravates me a little where I see people parallelling buying Early Access to being shareholders or even the “boss”. It doesn’t. It makes you a customer. We already have a duty to our customers, and a duty we intend on fully fulfilling. You guys don’t need to be our “shareholders” or our “bosses,” for us to do right by you. Being our customers and our fans is enough. We appreciate that more than anything else, in fact.</p>

<p>I love Black Mesa but you don’t need to glorify it so much.I dreamed of HL1 on Source since HL2 came out,but they don’t work on it for free.It’s like your 2nd job,your boss(customer) most likely always will be unsatisfied,but you get money from it so it’s not  a slavery.</p>

<p>They also get a lot of positive reviews from game journals and players,BM has the highest score on steam and sold about 500k copies without Xen according to SteamSpy.So the majority of players love Black Mesa you just focusing on negative side only.</p>
