<p>“Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school.”</p>
<p>“If your son has requested a new “processor” from a company called “AMD”, this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, “knock-off” copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well.”</p>
<p>I LOL’d so hard when reading this part.</p>

<p>Given that Linux is a derivative of Unix, that misspelling isn’t as silly as you might think. Mandrake Linux is the former name of Mandriva, so it was actually entirely correct at the time of the article’s writing.</p>
<p>I think the final sentence of the article describes it perfectly: “It cannot be taken too seriously”. I refuse to believe that anyone could sincerely hold the opinion that *nix distros are “all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War.”</p>

<p>well, i guess im wrong there, but i don’t agree with the other things like</p>
<p>buying a processor from AMD is bad, or</p>
<p>all hackers dress like ravers with pacifiers</p>
<p>and the terrible accusation that hackers go outside to socialize…</p>

            <p>My son asked me to buy him 2GB of RAM and a new video card for his birthday.</p>
<p>After reading that article, I decided the best course of action would be to beat his ass to the ground, <span class="bbcode-i">hacking traitor</span>.</p>

            <p>Given that Linux is a derivative of Unix, that misspelling isn’t as silly as you might think. Mandrake Linux is the former name of Mandriva, so it was actually entirely correct at the time of the article’s writing.</p>
