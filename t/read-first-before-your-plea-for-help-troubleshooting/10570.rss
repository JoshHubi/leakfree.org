    <description>Hello fellow scientists! 

For those who installed Black Mesa without the installer, please ensure that the folder placed into &quot;sourcemods&quot; is named &quot;BMS&quot;:
\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS

This can help resolve issues with game saves, subtitles, chapter names, and possibly any other issues that may be caused by utilizing the wrong folder name.

Please ensure that the folder name is correct before requesting help.</description>
