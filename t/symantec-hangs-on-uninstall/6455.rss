    <title>Symantec hangs on uninstall</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/symantec-hangs-on-uninstall/6455</link>
    <description>I know this program is notorious for being difficult to uninstall, but this is just ridiculous.  Add/Remove just creates an endless uninstall that never actually finishes.  I cannot manually delete the folders because they are somehow in use, though I don&#39;t know what program is using them.  What can I do to just get rid of it?

Side note: I did try to uninstall this before, and for all intents and purposes it seemed to work, though I never really searched for it&#39;s presence afterward.  Now I see it&#39;s really all there, except I can&#39;t start it or update it.  I just don&#39;t know what to do with this shit.</description>

<p>Sorry Jerry wasn’t really aimed at you, just in general.  I used to trust AVG but it crapped out on me once, and I ended up spending 2 days virus cleaning.  I’m not really a norton hater, but then I’ve had no real trouble with it.</p>

            <p>Norton is absolute crap. In all honesty though, Symantec’s business class products aren’t completely bad. Symantec Endpoint Protection is pretty good, at least on XP. When my company switched one of our clients over to Windows 7 machines though, things got kinda wonky. Somehow the very management client - not even the scanning or threat protection modules - has the ability to slow file transfer speeds to a crawl. Symantec’s still working on it. So yeah, not a <span class="bbcode-i">whole</span> lot of love for Symantec, but they aren’t the worst company we have to deal with.</p>
<p>Anyways, I use Avast free at home, and I’ve used AVG free before as well. Both are pretty good at what they do, but like it’s been said before, common sense is the best antivirus. As much as I dislike having to clean up after phishing errors and such, at least it gets me hours to bill. Lol. Oh and Malwarebytes is very good for cleaning up existing infections, though for bad ones it may break the system. Best antivirus remover is a format and reinstall. If an infection looks bad enough I always skip straight to reinstalling Windows. Faster and easier.</p>

            <p>^ they only made that because of class action lawsuit due to users being unable to remove Norton antivirus.</p>
<p>Also +1 common the common sense antivirus. I haven’t and an antivirus on my PC for years. I just install MS security essentials on computer that I service now as it doesn’t have all the fucking false positives like AVG does and also doesn’t bring the computer to a crawl like most of the other stuff.</p>

            <p>Surprised no one has mentioned this yet.</p>
<p>Symantec’s software digs in SO deep, they actually provide a dedicated “Symantec Removal Tool” on their web site.  Add/Remove programs can rarely get everything (and in the case of Symantec, even software like Revo can have issues).</p>
<p>Let’s just say you have NIS2009 (Norton Internet Security) - Google “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nis+2009+removal+tool&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">NIS 2009 removal tool</a>” - hope that helps.</p>

            <p>Avira installed here. Works like a charm, IMO best free antivirus around.</p>
<p>BTW do what Zageron said, just be sure to uncheck both norton services and startup entries in msconfig, not just one or the other.</p>

            <p>Haha. Norton.<br>
Go into the start menu, and type in msconfig. (Or run msconfig)</p>
<p>Click the Startup tab, for simplicity un-check EVERYTHING, otherwise find everything by Symantec.<br>
Another thing you can try is going into the services tab and look for anything by Symantec, un-check them.<br>
Restart your computer and attempt the un-installation again. If this fails again, then try to delete the folders.</p>
<p>If this succeeds, download CCleaner and clear out the registry entries.<br>
If it fails, I’m sure someone else will have a solution for your problems by the time I check back. ;]</p>

            <p>I know this program is notorious for being difficult to uninstall, but this is just ridiculous.  Add/Remove just creates an endless uninstall that never actually finishes.  I cannot manually delete the folders because they are somehow in use, though I don’t know what program is using them.  What can I do to just get rid of it?</p>
<p>Side note: I did try to uninstall this before, and for all intents and purposes it seemed to work, though I never really searched for it’s presence afterward.  Now I see it’s really all there, except I can’t start it or update it.  I just don’t know what to do with this shit.</p>
