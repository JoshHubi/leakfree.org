    <title>Hazard Course</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hazard-course/7405</link>
    <description>The Hazard Course project has been restarted. I am now hiring developers to  bring the hazard course up to the standards of Black Mesa and help complete the experience of the mod.

At present I&#39;m looking for:

* Concept Artists
* Prop Modelers
* Texture Artists/Skinners


The team as it currently stands is as follows:
[b]Project Lead:[/b] Deathmonkey7
[b]Level Designer:[/b] Catalyst, sIMson, Wfls
[b]Promo:[/b] Adam
[b]Concept Artist:[/b] brokenfridgehinge, Deathmonkey7, Tengine
[b]Prop/Environment Modeler:[/b] Jeannotvb, Nocturne
[b]Website Admin:[/b] Cameron D

Once Black Mesa is closer to release there will be some more jobs opening up.

If you would like to apply for one or more of these jobs please send your application to [email]hazardcourse@gmail.com[/email]. Please list any previous experience you have as well as samples of your work. Samples can include images, videos, or any files viewable with common applications. (Maximum attachment size of 25MB)

Thankfully, this project won&#39;t require the amount of man-hours that Black Mesa does, since we will be fortunate enough to have access to the resources used in Black Mesa once it is released. But that doesn&#39;t mean that any less dedication will be present in the development of this &quot;expansion&quot;. I fully expect there to be a seamless transition between this project and the mod itself, and it will not be released until that goal is met.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask in this thread. Just understand that this is pretty early and nothing has been fully decided yet. I have a pretty clear idea of what I want but anything is subject to change at this point.</description>

            <p>If not, I’m sure someone dumb like me might get bored and go through, changing the files and making the necessary modifications so it’s all nice and consistent.</p>
<p>Who else likes the idea of redoing mods like Life’s End with Mesa’s assets?</p>

            <p>Someone should get some sort of shared assets initiative going.</p>
<p>As much as the other games also look awesome, it would be pretty cool if everything looked and performed more or less consistently.</p>
<p>Probably not going to happen though… I’m sure the logistical problems would be a nightmare…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Shoot, if teams can come together to recreate Half Life, Opposing Force, Blue Shift, AND Decay, I don’t see how a small portion of the BlackMesa Research Facility such as the Hazard Course would be much of a problem getting started. I’m all for seeing this come to fruition. Good luck guys!</p>

<p>Second, is Tripmine Studios going to update their games in general to use assets from Black Mesa, since it’s coming out soon, and Xen is also coming out in a reasonable time frame?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Simple answer: <span class="bbcode-b">No</span></p>
<p>We will not use any assets, nor any geometry from any map in Black Mesa. That is not only stealing, but is completely against our own project goal.<br>
Although I have never personally had any real contact with anyone from Black Mesa, I have an immense amount of respect for their team and their work, so I would personally ensure no content was used without permission.</p>
<p>People tend to forget that we are also a collection of people who are making our own content with the intent of using it as a portfolio item for applying in the industry.</p>
<p>If members of Black Mesa would like to apply to join our team, then we will be more than happy to have them. But that is all strictly on an individual basis.<br>
If a member of Black Mesa would like to donate their own work to us, without officially joining our team, then we would accept it if it meets our standards (which im sure it would), and if no one on our team was already working on it. Credit would of course be given for said content.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><br>
But on topic…</span></p>
<p>I’m pretty excited to see what people are gonna be able to do with the hazard course.</p>
<p>We at Tripmine are currently working on the hazard course as well, but its in very early stages, so it’s pretty much all fair game right now  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Wait, I was happy for the argument to be over, but isn’t it kind of stirring shit up to claim that you won after deleting the relevant posts?  Can’t we just pretend it didn’t happen?  Isn’t that the point of deleting posts?  Wouldn’t a moderator know that?</p>

            <p>Like I said, I’m fine with the idea of BM sharing assets with TS only if they’re comfortable with it.  Tripmine Studios formed after the OBM and GD teams merged to share their own assets and ideas, although they are still working separately on both projects. They have their own internal consistency. The problem I see with this idea is the BM assets may clash with their own existing ones. GD and OBM both have their own version of the Houndeye, for example. So they should just turf both of them and replace it with the BM one?<br>
I think TS are a capable team and probably wouldn’t even want to use BM’s work. They’re too far in and too established to start throwing out their own hard work.<br>
Anway, you can argue your point all you like, but I can’t see it happening.</p>

            <p>I see it the opposite way.  I don’t think that Tripmine Studios should compromise their project goal for ideals that aren’t even relevant for this situation.  “If they just waited until BM released and essentially stole their assets to cut corners on their own mod”?  How is this not comparable to Black Mesa using Valve’s Source Engine and Valve’s Half-Life story?  Black Mesa is itself a mod, but I hardly see why this should make it immune to modding; if anything being a mod should prevent it from being immune to modding because that would be completely hypocritical.  Yes, Black Mesa itself doesn’t reuse any Valve assets, but it’s part of a community of excellent Half-Life mods that do reuse Valve assets, which Valve doesn’t shut down or mind.  (Take Minerva, for example, which I’m fairly certain reuses Half-Life 2’s NPCs.)  I think it might even be safe to say that without the Half-Life modding community, Black Mesa wouldn’t have been viable.  Black Mesa’s goal is to be an original reimagining of Half-Life, so it makes sense for BM to not reuse anybody’s assets.  But, though OBM and GD aim to be original reimaginings of Op4 and BS, they also aim to tie into Black Mesa, AFAIK, so it makes perfect sense for them to reuse BM’s assets.</p>

            <p>Well said, moving on…</p>
<p>My installed copy of 3ds Max got corrupted, will have to reinstall once I get my new PC in a few days.<br>
I can still map though.</p>
<p>Also, at the Gina model, I really suck at Character Modelling, props is what I can do.</p>

            <p>I misread your original post , I apologise. You have to remember that each team has their own vision and interpretation of what Black Mesa and its inhabitants should look and feel like.  If the BM devs gave permission for Tripwire to use their assets in OBM and GD then I wouldn’t have any problems with it. If they just waited until BM released and essentially stole their assets to cut corners on their own mod, then that would probably piss alot of people off.</p>
<p>Also, how much consistency are you expecting? Should all the enemies be the same models across all 3 games? Should they all use the same weapon models and sounds? Looking at GD and OBM now, I’d say they already look pretty consistent with BM, like they’re all one cohesive facility. It seems like they have their own  direction for the expansions, and they might not want to compromise on their artistic integrity for the sake of using another teams assets.</p>

            <p>Don’t worry fridge, I’m no dev. I barely know how to code in C++ much less how to steal assets I have no access to.</p>

            <p>No, I’m not a dev from Tripmine studios.  I’m suggesting what I think Tripmine studios should do, and what I’m worried they won’t do.  And how is it a low thing to do?  Yes, I know that Black Mesa prides itself on its art design; that’s what makes it special.  But it’s also a remake of Half-Life, and OBM and GD are remakes of BS and Op4 that, as far as I know, are supposed to tie in with Black Mesa in the same way that Blue Shift and Opposing Force tied in with Half-Life, so it only make sense that they should reuse common assets.  And you cannot possibly get into intellectual property arguments, because the entirety of the story of Black Mesa was copied from Half-Life, just like the entirety of the story of GD and OBM were copied from BS and Op4.  And don’t get into “if it were a commercial product”, because if it was a commercial product, it would get into trouble even if it didn’t reuse assets, as I’m sure the BM team knows, since it applies to their game as well.</p>

            <p>If it were a commercial product and you were redistributing someone else’s assets, there’s this little thing called copyright infringement and a nice big lawsuit to follow. This doesn’t really apply to BM, since it’s a free game. There’s nothing really stopping other teams from using BM’s content in their own mods, but personally I think it’s a pretty low thing to do.</p>
<p>Are you a dev from Tripmine studios? Because this is the first I’ve heard that they were going to be using BM assets.</p>

            <p>I thought the intention of the mod was to be played alongside Black Mesa?  Shouldn’t it match up with Black Mesa, then?  A large part of the appeal of the original expansions was that it obviously was the same setting as Half-Life, even if it wasn’t the same story.  It just seems stubborn to avoid that intergame consistency intentionally.</p>
