    <title>I&#39;ve installed it; how do I start it?!?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ive-installed-it-how-do-i-start-it/11017</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve downloaded Black Mesa Source, and when setup was done, it started up and worked. However, there is no icon on my desktop and it is not in my steam library. I tried to go into the actual files, but it is just a folder. Can anyone please tell me how to play this game without having to install it every time?</description>

            <p>I’ve learned over the years that on the Windows platform, the more software is installed on the system, the more potential conflicts there are with dll files and registry entries and whatnot. I can’t say exactly which program it is but it could be anything. If the mod works perfectly with a clean install of Windows 7 and Steam on a blank account(it does), then the problems could only be caused by some external variable that could be any program or tool installed on the computer.</p>

            <p>Worked perfectly for me. Installed just like any other mod. Must be a Steam problem.</p>

<p>I don’t think this is a Steam issue, there are thousands of post out on the internet about this problem. I have the same issue too, along with hundreds or thousands of others.<br>
Why did this have to be so complicated?<br>
I’ve been the biggest fan of Half Life since 1998 and I’ve been looking forward to this for so long but the whole process has been such hard work that I’ve decided to give up and just delete it!<br>
Every single step of this whole, painful process has had to be looked up. For weeks it wasn’t even possible to find and installer. Even when I did manage to get hold of it the mirrors were completely useless and just aided advertising for the mirror sites.<br>
In the end I opted for the torrent release. I then had to source the SDK and Steam. Install them in the correct order before coming up against the same b*****d problem that so many others have.<br>
Hats off to the Dev team for doing this but what a comedic, shambles of a way of releasing it.<br>
Sorry but it’s gone for me. Over 10 hours trying to get it to work and I give up!!</p>
<p>There’s no clear help at all from the developrs either. Thanks to those who have tried to help.</p>

<p>I’m in the same place as you - what’s the point in making a game, and then making it so difficult to get up and running?</p>
<p>SDK installed, Steam restarted, it just doesn’t show up.  No executable in the game folder.  Waste of time, such a shame.  Zero instructions from the developers.</p>

<p>Thanks, I made sure everything was in the right spot and it still won’t work. I actually think I am having problems with steam at this point, so I’m going to try to get some help from them. Thanks for you help.</p>

<p>I appreciate your answer, but how do I even restart Steam? I tried exiting and starting up, but that didn’t work. I tried using the “processes” thing, and that didn’t work. Is there a restart button somewhere that I missed?</p>
<p>EDIT: Ok, I restarted steam and it still isn’t showing up in the games library. In fact, almost none of my games are showing up in steam library.</p>
