            <p>Interesting Article which basically sums up my reasons for agreeing that gaming is important:</p>
<p><a href="https://noblesseoblige.org/2009/06/02/why-gaming-is-so-important-to-our-future/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://noblesseoblige.org/2009/06/02/why-gaming-is-so-important-to-our-future/</a></p>
<p>Whilst it’s mainly speculative, it is also kind of true.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure. As you see here, I’m a developer. But I attended both GDC and PAX recently, and whereas most people would pay a thousand dollars to get the full experience, I looked all over the place, and besides the nice career opportunities, I mostly just thought “What the hell? People are excited about this stuff?”<br>
Maybe it’s just that I’m mostly into indie games now, and I no longer preorder games or buy them without having played them, but I just couldn’t get so excited about anything that was there. Battlefield 3? Wait and see. Vindictus? Grindfest. Gaming hardware? As long as I can run this generation, I have no need to upgrade.

            <p>Not really. I love gaming, but I just don’t have the time for a lot of it. Half-Life was the first real PC game I ever played though, which is part of why I love it so much and am on these forums.</p>

            <p>Just for fun.</p>
<p>One time I heard a man giving advice to the wife of another man who was complaining about her husband’s silly hobby of collecting Lord of the Rings memorabilia.</p>
<p>It went along the lines of: “Men have to be occupied doing something stupid, otherwise they’ll end up doing something else that you probably don’t want them to do.”</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s kinda like that.</p>

            <p>Is it central to my life?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Does it offer important inspiration?</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>For example, I put my novel on hiatus two years ago.  However, now that I am playing Alan Wake…it has inspired me to continue that novel and begin creating worlds again.</p>
<p>And now that I’m thinking about it…video games really helped me with language and writing at an early age…when I was seven or eight.  I learned words complex at that stage from my adventure games, like Monkey Island, Full Throttle, The Journeyman Project, etc.  I also took up writing written versions of these games, which was perfect practice as a young writer.</p>
