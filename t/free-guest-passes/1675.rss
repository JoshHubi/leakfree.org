    <description>[b]EDIT: Both Guest Passes Redeemed. Please do not PM me, they are gone.[/b]

I have a guest pass to CSS and to DoDS.

First person with [b]over 200 posts[/b] to PM me which one they want will get it.
Obviously, if you want a CSS guest pass but its already taken, tough luck, shouldve asked for the DoDS pass. One pass per person, you can&#39;t ask for both lol.

All I ask is for a &quot;thanks&quot; in return to be posted here if you get one. Maybe some +rep.  :slight_smile: 

Why over 200 posts? Because theyve stuck around here, truly dedicated. Or they spamalot, in which case they should suck it.

NOTE: This isnt spam or anything, im serious, i have no use for a guest pass. I&#39;ll update this post once one/both of my passes are gone.

[b]Day of Defeat Source pass went to Coolm4n.[/b]
[b]Counter Strike Source pass went to Garthbartin.[/b]</description>

            <p>Sadly many of the boxes were empty.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
And I didnt want to get caught, so i only took photos of two games: portal, and oblivion. But the oblivion key didnt register (I’m assuming it wasn’t a steam CD key).</p>

            <p>I wouldve given away portal. I got it… ermm, <span class="bbcode-b">this person i know</span> got it real easy.</p>
<ol>
<li>He went into the mall, and walked into a videogame store</li>
<li>There were some PC games on display, with obviously no discs inside.</li>
<li>He opened up the portal box, and inside was the manual</li>
<li>On the manual was an unused CD key, which would never be used considering the case was on display</li>
<li>He took a photo of the CD key and activated it on his account.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, next time <span class="bbcode-b">this person</span> gets portal like that, i’ll let u know.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Sorry, but I think its obvious that it really cuts down on the amount of people that are gonna PM me. It just makes things easier. I never said the users will less than 200 are bad members, thats retarded.</p>
<p>Obviously, if they have 200+ posts they contribute, because I doubt the admins on these forums will tolerate over 200 posts of spam. I assume that they are good members, unlike the impression some of u guys are giving me. of course, it is a dick move to give away free CSS and DoDS guest passes. Right?</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter. The CSS account is taken by garthbartin once he posts a reply to this thread.<br>
EDIT: Passes are gone.</p>
