    <title>[solved] opening beta .vmf file in stable version of Hammer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/solved-opening-beta-vmf-file-in-stable-version-of-hammer/15352</link>
    <description>So I was working on a map in Hammer while I had the beta version installed. But now the stable version&#39;s Hammer will crash upon opening the .vmf file. Is there any way to convert the map file or do I have to wait until the next major update before publishing it on the workshop?</description>
