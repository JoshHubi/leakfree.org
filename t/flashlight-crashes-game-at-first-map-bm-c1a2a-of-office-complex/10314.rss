    <title>Flashlight crashes game at first map (bm_c1a2a) of &quot;Office Complex&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/flashlight-crashes-game-at-first-map-bm-c1a2a-of-office-complex/10314</link>
    <description>Greetings Developers and Community,

My first impression of Black Mesa: Unbelievable, not describable.
Just wow...

Sadly I encountered a rather heavy bug at the first map of &quot;Office Complex&quot; aka bm_c1a2a

As soon as I want to turn on my flashlight, the game crashes back to desktop, saying &quot;Half Life 2 does not work anymore&quot;.
I tried several times to be certain and it definitely always happens the moment I press f.

MDMP attached.

Greetings KiLlEr []

<p>That’s ok, thanks for posting specs. Hardware you have should be more than OK for playing Black Mesa. Could still be a driver bug - ATI/AMD and notorious for the quality of their drivers. Had you double-checked that you’re using latest version of the driver (should be 12.8 or 12.9 as of now IIRC)? Had you tried switching the game into using non-HRD simplified lighting mode (i.e. shadows detail set to “Low” or “Middle”, HDR set to “None”, bloom effect - to “disabled”)?</p>
<p>Also, you could try resetting CCC settings into defaults (there been reports about the game crashing due to some settings combinations in CCC) or could try to downgrade your driver version to something more ancient.</p>

<p>driver is up to date, I will try the one with lower shadow details.<br>
Btw I am already past the map, but it seems to happen at others too, but I forgot to write down at which ones.</p>

<p>Alright here ya go with my system (sorry that I forgot):<br>
ASRock H77 Pro4-M Intel H77<br>
Intel Core i5 2329 4x 3.00GHz<br>
16GB (2x 8192MB ) G.Skill RipjawsX DDR3-1600<br>

OS is Windows 7 Professional 64bit</p>
<p>My system runs on a 128GB SSD, but Steam (and therefore Black Mesa) is installed on a usual (2TB ) Harddrive.<br>

            <p>Just adding that I also get this issue for the entire map.  I’m at the electrified room where you have to jump across table to get to a vent.  Once you’re in the vent, it’s very dark!  I have tried different resolutions with no effect.</p>

            <p>I have encountered the same problem, in about the same location during Unforeseen Consequences. The bm_c1a2a auto-save is what I load, and anytime I attempt to use my flashlight, game crashes.</p>
<p>I would love to continue playing, this mod brings back so many memories.</p>
