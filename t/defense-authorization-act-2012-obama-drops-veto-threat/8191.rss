    <description>Hey guys! It&#39;s me again!


      Just want to do everyone a favor by passing some news along and seeing what people think about it. 

     The Big Brand New &quot;Defense Authorization Act&quot;! Who digs? Who&#39;s bummed? Why? 

     [url]https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/us/politics/obama-wont-veto-military-authorization-bill.html[/url]

     [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0qBnJjGIBA&amp;feature=uploademail[/url]

     [url]https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2011/12/defense-bill-passes-house-107550.html[/url]

     [url]https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/13/national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa-obama-detainee-policy_n_1145407.html[/url]

    Big Government is Big ... and just got bigger

    On a serious note, everyone should not be happy by this at all. I mean this could all be a set up along the same lines as this [url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933[/url]

    If you hate or are apathetic towards liberties you are for this new Defense Act. If you are for liberties you are against this Defense Act. I don&#39;t think the line can be any clearer than that.</description>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I get my data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other official statistics gathering sites, not from places like the Discovery Insti–er, I mean, Ludwig Von Mises Institute (sorry, they both have equal amounts of data to back up their ludicrous positions so I get confused).</p>
<p>It’s also common sense.</p>
<p>When people shop, businesses must hire.  Giving money to businesses in the form of tax breaks or giving them other things such as reductions in regulations will not cause them to hire more people.  Because it would be idiotic to hire people that don’t have a job that needs to be done.</p>
<p>I like to go back to “Little Shop of Horrors” with Steve Martin and Rick Moranis for an illustration of what I mean.  Yes, I know this is about a man-eating singing plant from outer space, but ignore the major premise of the movie and let’s take a look at a scene because it’s very realistic and central to my point.</p>
<p>Mr. Mushnik is a small business owner.  He runs a small flower shop and he has two employees: Seymour and Audrey.  He has the supply.  He is open for business.  But, there’s a problem:  No customers.  They stand around for almost a full day waiting for customers.  Finally, at the end of the business day, this exchange happens:</p>
<p>Mushnik: “Six o’clock, and we haven’t sold so much as a fern…  That’s it!  Forget it!  Don’t bother coming in tomorrow.”<br>
Seymour: “You don’t mean…?”<br>
Mushnik: “What?  What?  What don’t I mean?  I mean, I’m through!  Kaput!”<br>
Audrey: “You can’t…!”<br>
Mushnik: “Kaput!  Extinct!  I’m closing this God- and customer-forsaken place!”</p>
<p>Mushnik could not afford to continue to run his business without customers and he could not afford to continue employing his two employees.  Tax breaks, relaxation of regulations, none of this would work to continue the employ of Audrey and Seymour.  And it would not help Mushnik stay in business.</p>
<p>After this exchange, they place the man-eating plant out to advertise and customers begin pouring in.  Audrey and Seymour can keep their jobs and Mushnik is very happy and he got a lot of money that day.  As the movie progresses and the plant grows very large, more and more customers flood in.  If this was reality, Mushnik would have to hire more help because he and his two employees would not be able to accommodate influx of customers on their own.</p>
<p>Continuing beyond the movie now, if the customer-base continues to grow, more and more employees would have to be hired and the business would grow.  Support staff such as payroll would have to be hired.  As the customer-base continues to grow, the growers and sellers of these plants would get more money because Mushnik would be buying more and more of their stock.  And these growers and sellers would, in turn, have to hire people to help accommodate Mushnik’s business.</p>
<p>Then there’s Audrey and Seymour.  They are employed and they get paid.  They go out and buy things with that money and help to create jobs in the area.  These additional jobs from Mushnik’s rising business and the jobs created to accommodate the increased demand from Audrey and Seymour (and other employees).  The jobs begin to grow exponentially.</p>
<p>And increasing taxes and regulations on Mushnik would NOT stop him from hiring new people.  It would be a completely idiotic thing for him to do.</p>
<p>This is why I think these “libertarian” (I use this word loosely) economists are flatly wrong.  They claim things that just are not true.  It’s as though they are claiming that the sun rises in the west and they ridicule anyone that says otherwise.</p>

<p>No, remember that anarcho-capitalism is the most extreme form of libertarianism. Just because one is a right-wing libertarian does not mean he/she supports anarcho-capitalism.

<p>No.  The debt is not caused by the stimulus.  In fact, the stimulus made the debt smaller than it would’ve been had the stimulus not happened.</p>

</aside>
<p>Are you kidding me? Do you have any idea how bad the current economic situation in the US / EU is? We are in the deepest ditch ever seen in history! You sure as shit can’t blame that on capitalism or free markets, because we’ve had neither for nearly 100 years.</p>
<p>And no, the stimulus did not work, unemployment is higher. But it’s no surprise really, how could borrowing money possibly create jobs when all the money goes into consumer spending of products made in foreign countries like China. All that the stimulus did in the end was create more of the same: DEBT.</p>

<p>Nah.  I learned it from researching history and every time Keynesian policies have been implemented, the economy flourished.  Every time polices of people like Friedman have been implemented, we’ve gone into recessions and bread lines.</p>

            <p>He wants to abolish the central bank, the IRS, 5+ departments, cut government spending in the trillions. Go back to sound money (gold standard), get rid of the income tax. Significantly lower the regulatory burden for (small) businesses, get rid of totalitarian junk like the Patriot Act. He wants to bring back all foreign troops, go back to a non-interventionist foreign policy (peace and trade but no alliances, no foreign aid).</p>
<p>He wants to end the corporatism, the totalitarianism, bring back free market capitalism and trash the pseudo-scientific garbage called keynesianism.</p>
<p>When a man says those things, I’d say his views on abortion are the least of my concern. But I guess that’s just my personal opinion.</p>

<p>Yes, I appear to have done.  I’m reading up on the guy and he’s actually fairly respectable.  I don’t like his pro-life stance, though.  In my mind the issue of abortion is one that no politician has any business sticking their nose in.</p>

</aside>
<p>Qft</p>
<p>The whole election system is messed up in my point of view. 1. Candidates basically have no choice but sucking the dick of every major corporation, because otherwise they can not campaign successfully (see Ron Paul) (tax-funded system not present in the U.S.?). 2. Plurality-voting system.</p>

<p>Instead of stretching the system beyond its breaking point to maintain the current status quo, conservatives just need to give the fuck up and move with the times.</p>

<p>What you’ve just said is one of the first things Ron Paul wrote in his book:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">There is no change in American politics. The word “change” always results in more government, more taxing, more money printing, more invasions of privacy, and more military conflict.  US entitlement programs are financially untenable, underfunded by tens of trillions of dollars. The US government borrows money from countries all over the world, especially China, to keep troops in countries all over the world. Having such an extensive military presence makes the American people less safe by creating animosity against us.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Unless you want to contradict what you’ve just said, you’d have to vote for Ron Paul. Why? Because all other candidates want to maintain the status quo.</p>

</aside>
<p>lol, Ron Paul</p>
<p>But I agree with the sentiment.  The US is really going down the tubes.  Instead of stretching the system beyond its breaking point to maintain the current status quo, conservatives just need to give the fuck up and move with the times.</p>
<p>Don’t take this for a second to mean that I hold conservatives solely responsible for the state the country’s in.  I’m speaking almost exclusively on the topics of gay rights, abortion rights, and progressive research technologies like stem cell research and alternative energy, as they’re the issues in the current US political theatre that I actually give a fuck about.  Conservatives are really holding all of these back while the rest of the world surges ahead.</p>

<p>That’s a paraphrase of Benjamin Franklin, actually, not Jefferson.  Though, I don’t think Jefferson would disagree.</p>
