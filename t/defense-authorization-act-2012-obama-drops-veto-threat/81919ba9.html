<p>Read a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Manifesto-Ron-Paul/dp/0446537519" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">book</a>. Pretty good for ‘beginners’. Other good books i’d recommend are: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Fed-Ron-Paul/dp/B006J3V150/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325883763&amp;sr=1-1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">End the Fed</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Economy-State-Murray-Rothbard/dp/0945466323/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325883782&amp;sr=1-2" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Man Economy and State</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Road-Serfdom-Documents---Definitive-Collected/dp/0226320553/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325883826&amp;sr=1-1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Road to Serfdom</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Law-Frederic-Bastiat/dp/1612930123/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Law</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economics-One-Lesson-Shortest-Understand/dp/0517548232/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325883870&amp;sr=1-1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Economics in One Lesson</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Economy-Grows-Why-Crashes/dp/047052670X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325883912&amp;sr=1-1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">How an Economy Grows and Why it Crashes</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crash-Proof-2-0-Economic-Collapse/dp/111815200X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325883926&amp;sr=1-1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Crash Proof 2.0</a></p>
<p>All highly rated books written by renowned (political) economists, if you’re interested I can recommend you some books on precious metals investing.</p>

<p>I would love for either or both of you to pull down journal articles and economic analyses supporting your claims.  Not because I think you’re both full of crap, but because it’s come to my attention that I’m woefully ignorant in the political and economic arenas, and I’m genuinely interested in figuring out which of the two of you is more correct.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I get my data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other official statistics gathering sites, not from places like the Discovery Insti–er, I mean, Ludwig Von Mises Institute (sorry, they both have equal amounts of data to back up their ludicrous positions so I get confused).</p>
<p>It’s also common sense.</p>
<p>When people shop, businesses must hire.  Giving money to businesses in the form of tax breaks or giving them other things such as reductions in regulations will not cause them to hire more people.  Because it would be idiotic to hire people that don’t have a job that needs to be done.</p>
<p>I like to go back to “Little Shop of Horrors” with Steve Martin and Rick Moranis for an illustration of what I mean.  Yes, I know this is about a man-eating singing plant from outer space, but ignore the major premise of the movie and let’s take a look at a scene because it’s very realistic and central to my point.</p>
<p>Mr. Mushnik is a small business owner.  He runs a small flower shop and he has two employees: Seymour and Audrey.  He has the supply.  He is open for business.  But, there’s a problem:  No customers.  They stand around for almost a full day waiting for customers.  Finally, at the end of the business day, this exchange happens:</p>
<p>Mushnik: “Six o’clock, and we haven’t sold so much as a fern…  That’s it!  Forget it!  Don’t bother coming in tomorrow.”<br>
Seymour: “You don’t mean…?”<br>
Mushnik: “What?  What?  What don’t I mean?  I mean, I’m through!  Kaput!”<br>
Audrey: “You can’t…!”<br>
Mushnik: “Kaput!  Extinct!  I’m closing this God- and customer-forsaken place!”</p>
<p>Mushnik could not afford to continue to run his business without customers and he could not afford to continue employing his two employees.  Tax breaks, relaxation of regulations, none of this would work to continue the employ of Audrey and Seymour.  And it would not help Mushnik stay in business.</p>
<p>After this exchange, they place the man-eating plant out to advertise and customers begin pouring in.  Audrey and Seymour can keep their jobs and Mushnik is very happy and he got a lot of money that day.  As the movie progresses and the plant grows very large, more and more customers flood in.  If this was reality, Mushnik would have to hire more help because he and his two employees would not be able to accommodate influx of customers on their own.</p>
<p>Continuing beyond the movie now, if the customer-base continues to grow, more and more employees would have to be hired and the business would grow.  Support staff such as payroll would have to be hired.  As the customer-base continues to grow, the growers and sellers of these plants would get more money because Mushnik would be buying more and more of their stock.  And these growers and sellers would, in turn, have to hire people to help accommodate Mushnik’s business.</p>
<p>Then there’s Audrey and Seymour.  They are employed and they get paid.  They go out and buy things with that money and help to create jobs in the area.  These additional jobs from Mushnik’s rising business and the jobs created to accommodate the increased demand from Audrey and Seymour (and other employees).  The jobs begin to grow exponentially.</p>
<p>And increasing taxes and regulations on Mushnik would NOT stop him from hiring new people.  It would be a completely idiotic thing for him to do.</p>
<p>This is why I think these “libertarian” (I use this word loosely) economists are flatly wrong.  They claim things that just are not true.  It’s as though they are claiming that the sun rises in the west and they ridicule anyone that says otherwise.</p>
