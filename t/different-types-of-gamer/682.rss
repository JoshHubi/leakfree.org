    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/different-types-of-gamer/682</link>
    <description>Came across this in chat and we thought it might be fun to assign each number to a forum member... Now, this is all in good fun, so don&#39;t get your knickers in a twist if your name appears below. Some of them are a bit random, too, where there isn&#39;t a perfect fit. 

Right, then. First, the pic:

[img]https://plaza.fi/s/f/editor/images/perjantaikevennyt_trollit_uut0906_1.jpg[/img]

Now, the assignments:

1: [b]Old Dirty Bastard[/b] (OMG SONY RULEZ)
2: [b]Lamsey [/b](Consoles? What are these consoles of which you speak?)
3: [b]Siggs [/b](Purely for the caption)
4: [b]bob [/b](I&#39;m a Mac Fanboy! No wait now I&#39;m a PC fanboy!)
5: [b]Hubi [/b](Plays with barbies)
6: [b]P.Thunder[/b] (OMG LOOK AT ME I GET DRUNK LOTS I&#39;M SO COOL)
7: [b]Cpl. Insane[/b] (36:1 k:d in TF2)
8: [b]Raminator [/b](Has been known to attend LAN parties, I&#39;m told)
9: [b]SassyRobot [/b](I&#39;m gonna get it for this :fffuuu :slight_smile: 
10: [b]Jokerine [/b]( &lt;3 )
11: [b]iKy [/b](claims to be 14 but acts much younger)
12: [b]raw_bean[/b] (Well, of course, when [i]I[/i] were a lad...)
13: [b]Comrade Tiki[/b] (TF2 is so unrealistic and deviates so much from the original, BAWWW)
14: [b]Sersoft [/b](I STEAL THINGS)
15: [b]Soup [/b](I SLAG PEOPLE WHO STEAL THINGS)
16: [b]blue [/b](Modeller extraordinaire)
17: [b]Calgar [/b](Experienced MMORPG addict)
18: [b]MaxTheLimit [/b]([url=&#39;https://www.blackmesasource.com/forums/showthread.php?p=14941#post14941&#39;]reason[/url])
19: [b]Com[e]r[/b] (Obviously into his anime etc., judging from his avatar)
20: [b]Eric Fong[/b] (Obsessed witht )
21: [b]wheybags [/b]([url=&#39;https://www.blackmesasource.com/forums/showthread.php?p=6192&amp;highlight=pokemon#post6192&#39;]reason[/url])
22: [b]Jambo [/b](Massive Steam games folder)
23: [b]Keresh [/b](o hai guys what&#39;s going on in this chat)
24: [b]mattemuse [/b](Likes to make assertions)
25: [b]AngrE M0nkE[/b] (Look at the pic. Just look at it.)
26: [b]Kaze [/b](Do I really need to explain this one?)
27: [b]level [/b](And any number of others. Dishonorable mention for our fallen comrade Ihranator)


As a relative newfag, I&#39;m maybe not the best person to make these judgements, of course. Anyone want to improve on the suggestions above?

And remember, this thread ain&#39;t for flamin&#39;. Leave that at the door.</description>

            <p>he is what would be called “The Slow Gamer”, someone who looks at their keyboard desperately for which button pulls up the map, who fires at his teammates for two minutes before figuring out they’re friendly, and who keeps firing at enemies twenty seconds after they’ve been killed by a teammate.</p>

            <p>well sometimes a thread might pick up momentum again and people will start posting like crazy. but if most of us have already posted here now only newcomers will ever see a reason to post in this thread. and if the thread was pushed back many pages they would only ever find this via searches or links from other threads.</p>
<p>well that is my 2 cents on it</p>
<p>oh and about my post a bit up there ( made a while ago apparenty) I find I don’t get any motion sickness at all with multiplayer games but some single player mods with no motion blur where I need to look around a lot gives me the pains.</p>

            <p>If forced into one of those categories, it would probably be 24, however that just does not seem right to me. I cannot objectively describe myself so idk.</p>
<p>(Because on topic discussion occurred in an old thread, does this mean that it is no longer dead and can be posted in?) I don’t remember anything in the rules about such a thing.</p>

            <p>He was on topic, and he wasn’t around when the thread was originally created, so I’d give it a pass even if it’s necroing.</p>
<p>His only other option would basically be to either create a duplicate thread or just not post, in which case there’s no reason for him to come here and contribute to any of the other threads.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I hate consoles because I don’t find any games worth playing on them. With a PC I can do other interesting stuff between games.</p>
<p>Also I use both Windows and Linux and I need to learn a lot more about Linux. I think I know enough about Windows as it is.</p>
<p>I get “motion sickness” when I spend too much time on a game in deep concentration. Then I need a break from it. Lay down in bed, watch TV. Don’t know if this is a sign of good health or not.</p>
<p>Anything else you think I should mention about what kind of gamer I am?</p>
