    <title>E3 supports SOPA/PIPA</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/e3-supports-sopa-pipa/8356</link>
    <description>So I saw there was no thread of this in Black Mesa forums:
[url]https://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/stand-together-the-gaming-community-vs-sopa-and-pipa[/url]

Apparently ESA, which funds the E3, also supports the SOPA bill that we all love to hate. So by not supporting E3 and not giving them money or exposure (no attending and covering E3), you will be hurting ESA&#39;s support of E3.

Share your opinions on whether this action is necessary, how it will make a difference, is E3 really potentially responsible for hurting freedom of speech, how much this year&#39;s E3 will suck if people will do this, half life 3 in E3 etc...</description>

<p>I knew that when I saw either, 2010’s or 2011’s E3, whichever one first showed off the Kinect and PsMove. It was horrible.</p>

            <p>I don’t know if there’s more to it than that or not (I DO there that there is more to it when it comes to a lot of the other SOPA supporters, like the MPAA).</p>
<p>What I do is that they support an awful, overreaching, and damaging bill, and the fact that their stance isn’t surprising has no bearing on how I feel about it. It’s irresponsible at best, and they should be held accountable by consumers.</p>

            <p>So what we are seeing here is a group that represents people who make an oft pirated product support a bill that attempts to prevent piracy? Shocking. And can we really criticize them for advocating stronger enforcement of existing laws?</p>

            <p>Yeah, 'cept that professional media have money to pay copyrights, so anyone thats not as big as them won’t have the money to pay for it, essentially killing the small guy.</p>
<p>Not only that, but also the fact that most of the supporters of SOPA are big names such as EA, Nintendo and Sony. Considering publishers tend to be assholes in the gaming scene, I would not be surprised if they didn’t take advantage of this by essentially taking down reviews that give their games a bad score.</p>
<p>Maybe I think it would turn out too Orwellian, but that doesn’t change the fact that this won’t do shit to piracy, since it only takes place in the US, so ThePirateBay won’t be affected in any way (for example). So not only failing what it’s suppoused to do, this would only impulse the use of clandestine “underground internet” to share files and other kinds of piracy (and before you say it’s impossible, pedophiles use this to distribute their material for years).</p>
<p>My three pebbles of thought into this small flowing river of discussion.<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]<br>
Attention Deficit Disorder version: SOPA is flawed publishers would crush anyone who would dare give their games a bad review and it would make us pedophiles also legacy of kain reference</p>

<p>What you’ve done is posted a link to a video of people, who use other peoples content to make money without any kind of permission and are upset that they’ll have to jump through the hoops professional media have to, freedom of speech is one thing but freedom to leech is another. Try and use any of there content like they use others and see what happens.</p>
<p>Also E3 is a trade show, so good luck attending if they change there mind. And remember that pax is not a trade show, but will feature ESA members so should that be boycotted as well.</p>

            <p>Fair point, but that could be said about most conventions.<br>
With other types of media, I’d agree that it’s all about business, but this is video games. It’s in developer’s interests to make great games and consoles, and ultimately it’s your choice whether to buy something. Filling people with hype and showing off their games- which are essentially just products- is what E3 is for.</p>
