    <title>ATTENTION: Computer Whizzes; Tech Question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/attention-computer-whizzes-tech-question/3372</link>
    <description>Any idea why my workstation is only using half of it&#39;s available RAM? It&#39;s an i7 system with Windows 7 &quot;Home Premium&quot; 64 bit.

<p>The pixels are smoother and more “analog” in Windows because of Microsoft’s proprietary DSP processing. You tend to get some low-frequency “drift” in Linux and in OSX everything is too sharp and “digital.” Windows has a warmer and more organic feel. It’s like you’re looking “through” the windows rather than “at” them.</p>

<p>I don’t know what it is, it’s just how it feels, I recognize a windows machine no matter what skin is installed, but when Aero is enabled and the new Vista cursor is in use, it feels almost exactly like using a mac, so I always revert to aero basic and the XP cursor when I can.</p>

            <p>this thread has now devolved into random computer questions and BS, which is why I asked for it to be closed like a week ago. I don’t particularly care because my problem was already solved thanks to a <span class="bbcode-b">manufacturer’s warrantee</span>, I’m just sayin…</p>

<p>I kind of have a similar problem/question with my system. I have a self built system and I have tried to throw the 2 extra sticks of RAM I have in my computer. But when I throw one stick in the computer doesn’t start. Every stick is good because I have run a mem test on them and have switched them out with each other and my pc runs fine. But once one or both sticks are thrown in the splash screen doesn’t even show up for the motherboard. Bad slots? BIOS settings need configuring? Not sure myself.</p>

            <p>This story has a happy ending - i had a tech at my house within 2 days of reporting the problem, replaced my mobo under warrantee, new shit works perfectly. I can now sculpt with 25 million polygons in Blender (once they update their sculpting code to be useable with 25m).</p>
<p>I already said /thread but now it’s really /thread.</p>

</aside>
<p>When that “insignificant amount of money” is several hundreds of  dollars, then it IS worth the time/effort/risk, which isn’t as high as you put it.</p>

            <p>With someone watching over you while you do the work, the chance of that fuckup is rather unlikely.  Not to mention, the system you build yourself would indeed have better components.  OEMs probably still use 4 layer PCB RAM and mobos, the cheapest hard drives with shorter duty cycles, and parts with slower memory.  Spending 2-3 hours assembling a system yourself, using far better/more stable parts, while saving $200, seems pretty good to me.  I could see your point (even if I still disagree) if the difference were $20, but $200 will buy me 4 or 5 fillups in my car, hardly nothing…</p>
<p>The first time I had to go inside a system, I was paranoid about it too.  Someone watched my back, I learned a lot, and everything went smooth.  After that, it was so basic to me I wondered why I’d ever been worried…</p>

            <p>Not everybody thinks its worth the time/effort/risk just to save an insignificant amount of money. Can anyone honestly say that a first-time DIY build has <span class="bbcode-b">less </span>chance of assembly fuckups than my current “working perfectly with slightly less RAM than I paid for” situation? I highly doubt that - my PC even “broken” as it is now can run any game I’ve thrown at it on the highest detail settings. The only reason I need those extra 4gb is for raytracing HD images.</p>
