    <description>I know that this isn&#39;t a bug/issue specific to Black Mesa, but Source engine games across the board, but I&#39;m wondering if there is a solution, if the devs know something about this, I would like to enjoy Black Mesa maxed out on my hardware, as limited as it may be, i&#39;m sure it supports High quality shadows.</description>
