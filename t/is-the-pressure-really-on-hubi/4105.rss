    <title>is the pressure really on Hubi?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-the-pressure-really-on-hubi/4105</link>
    <description>Hi Everybody!

I saw this &quot;Black Mesa Fan Trailer #2&quot; and I can&#39;t help but ask...

Is online in BMS going to turn out bad just like Super Smash bros Brawl?

For anybody who hasn&#39;t played smash bros, basically Nintendo delayed the game quite a few months because they &quot;needed to improve the online capabilities.&quot; Yet when the game came out, the online was still really bad!

So... If this video is right,the presure is all on Hubi...

If the pressure really is on Hubi for this release, I just wanted to make this post as a gentle sportsman like butt-slap  :wink:  for Hubicorn, I believe you can and will make BMS online not only functional. But much.... MUCH better than Super Smash Bros. Brawl online. (and if it takes a few months to do so, than so be it.)

Also, if nobody from the DEV team can answer this question then I am fine with that (I would just like to see people&#39;s responses).

P.S. the fan trailer is here [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgIxV5NxyZM[/url]

*EDIT*

Super Smash Bros is amazing and whoever hasn&#39;t played is probably living under a rock made of FPS games.</description>

            <p>Part of the trailer features a silly post by me, made in response to a post to someone asking about Steam IDs on the forum and then complaining about BM not being released yet.  Hubi quoted that post in his signature and picked up by Cameron:D in his trailer.</p>
<p>Thanks guys, by the way.  You know how to make a guy feel all gooey inside…</p>

            <p>hahaha what?</p>
<p>hubi has NOTHING to do with the development of black mesa whatsoever. this entire topic has so much wat in it that my brain is doing fruitloops trying to figure out how you managed to piece together all of… of THAT, with just a fan made trailer to go on. :lol:</p>

            <p>Hi Everybody!</p>
<p>I saw this “Black Mesa Fan Trailer <span class="hashtag">#2</span>” and I can’t help but ask…</p>
<p>Is online in BMS going to turn out bad just like Super Smash bros Brawl?</p>
<p>For anybody who hasn’t played smash bros, basically Nintendo delayed the game quite a few months because they “needed to improve the online capabilities.” Yet when the game came out, the online was still really bad!</p>
<p>So… If this video is right,the presure is all on Hubi…</p>
<p>If the pressure really is on Hubi for this release, I just wanted to make this post as a gentle sportsman like butt-slap  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  for Hubicorn, I believe you can and will make BMS online not only functional. But much… MUCH better than Super Smash Bros. Brawl online. (and if it takes a few months to do so, than so be it.)</p>
<p>Also, if nobody from the DEV team can answer this question then I am fine with that (I would just like to see people’s responses).</p>
<p>P.S. the fan trailer is here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgIxV5NxyZM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgIxV5NxyZM</a></p>
<p><em>EDIT</em></p>
<p>Super Smash Bros is amazing and whoever hasn’t played is probably living under a rock made of FPS games.</p>
