    <title>Netbook and Win7 start-up issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/netbook-and-win7-start-up-issues/3745</link>
    <description>My roommate went away for the weekend, and when he came back his netbook would turn on, go to the login screen, but it wouldn&#39;t go past the Welcome screen in Win7. The loading circle is still spinning, but nothing else is happening. The the little blue light next to the half-moon symbol on the laptop stays on, so I figured that it thought it might be in some kind of pseudo- sleep mode, but when we hit the sleepmode button, the computer went into sleep mode. He can get to the windows recovery screen and it gives him the options to go into safemode, SM w/ networking, SM w/ command prompt. He can get into safe mode, he hasn&#39;t tried the others, but we don&#39;t know what to do in safe mode. All he does with it is go on the internet, use microsoft office, and use itunes. Its brandnew, he just got it for Christmas and could use some help. What I told you is all we know. Any help would be appreciated. 
This is his netbook [url=&#39;https://www.amazon.com/MSI-L2100-036US-12-1-Inch-Netbook-Black/dp/B002WSJTGY/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt&#39;]https://www.amazon.com/MSI-L2100-036US-12-1-Inch-Netbook-Black/dp/B002WSJTGY/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt[/url]</description>

            <p>If you get into safemode, in the Run box (the search box in the start menu), type in MSCONFIG</p>
<p>Go into the Services and Startup tabs and copy down all of the entries, and post em up here. We can tell you which you can disable so your bootup experience is a minimal one. Then when that works (and it should), you can enable them one-by-one or something to figure out the issue.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know how to use a computer, but not how to do a whole lot else. I admittedly don’t know what ‘unsigned services’ or ‘autorun entrys’ are. We tried system restore, and we saw two dates on the list of places to restore to, the 7th and 8th of this month. He went away on the 9th, so we set system restore to the 8th, and that didn’t fix anything.</p>

</aside>
<p>He checked, and the most recently installed things were an itunes update, a itunes bonjure and quicktime install. The last two he didn’t tell them to install. He tried to uninstall them, but it wouldn’t let him. He doesn’t know all of what the itunes update did, but he does know that it added stuff for the ipad.</p>
