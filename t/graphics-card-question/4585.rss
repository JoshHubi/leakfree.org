    <title>Graphics Card Question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/graphics-card-question/4585</link>
    <description>Let me get this out of the way: I know almost nothing about customizing computers. I&#39;ve never swapped any parts inside of my rig.

A couple of days ago, Mass Effect was listed for $5 on Steam. I had heard the game was cool, I looked it up, and I bought it. But when I ran it the next day (10 gb download..three..hours...), I got the same error that many with outdated graphics cards got: &quot;Failed to compile...&quot; at the splash screen.
So I looked it up, aparantly I don&#39;t have Pixel Shader 3.0 compatibility. I looked up what graphics card I had... I have a Radeon X300, an 8 year old Shader Model 2.0 graphics card.
Hooray.  :frowning: 

So now I&#39;m gonna raise up a lot of money to nab myself a modern card. But I&#39;m not sure what to get that would be good. I was looking at a Zotac GeForce GTX 480, but that seems to be like, top-tier of the graphics hierarchy. And it&#39;s 500 bucks. Yikes.
I don&#39;t do many modern PC games... Mass Effect would be my most modern PC game I have. [Portal was 2007 right? I think ME was &#39;08]. I&#39;m looking for a cheap yet powerful graphics card that can do at  least Shader Model 3.0. Is the Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTX pretty good for that? I know that Crysis was it&#39;s  poster child practically, so I&#39;m certain that would be enough to play ME.

Any economical yet modern suggestions, and advice on what to look out for, would be much appreciated! Custom computer parts seem to be a pretty difficult thing to dive into...</description>

<p>Or…custom build a new pc over time  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  maybe buy now pay later thats always cool.</p>

<p>This.</p>
<p>If you still have a single-core, DDR1, AGP-slotted machine, there is no point in throwing more money at a sinking ship.  I understand you don’t have a lot of money RIGHT NOW, but you won’t have ANY money 2 weeks from now if you buy a videocard for that box.</p>
<p>Also consider that AGP is an aging/dead technology - you’ll actually pay MORE (in terms of price/performance ratios) than you would for a new card.  Consider - a Radeon HD4670 with an AGP slot is $125 on NewEgg.  A Radeon HD5770 with a PCIe slot can be purchased for $150, and that card will dance around the 4670 all day.</p>
<p>Recommendation?  Build a custom PC (you can build a cheap box for ~$650, if you want a parts list let me know) or go hunting on eBay/Craigslist for a used PC from the last 1-2 years.  Either way, your best bet is to replace that crypt-keeper of a machine, not upgrade it.</p>
<p>In light of the holiday:</p>

            <p>EDIT: ^^^^ For one thing, Crysis looked as good as the lake-and-mountains DX10 shot while I still could only run DX9, it’s just that some features I had to enable in the console since the game wouldn’t let me in the options menus (still ran fine when I enabled them forcibly).  In fact, I just switched to Windows 7 and DX10 along with it, and saw nothing with Crysis that I didn’t see with DX9.</p>
<p>Though tessellation may be different.  I haven’t actually seen any games that used it until that shot there, and it sounds to me like it’s not really worth anybody’s time to implement it right now.  It may be a true unique function added in DX10, but I’m still waiting to be showed wider use.  Also, that shot it looks like it just exaggerated the geometry, or simply was using higher-detail models.  Isn’t tessellation more about smoothing things out, not adding significant geometric character?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every version of DX is an incremental improvement over the last one. The difference between two consecutive versions is minimal. That’s how it was made to be. The only way they’re a sham is that card manufacturers hype the latest version of DX as some kind of important feature in order to make sales.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s also to force people/gamers to make the transition from XP to Vista or 7.  I still don’t think DX10 or DX11 really do anything DX9 can’t (hell, you can’t even distinguish their screenshots in comparisons).  I was running Quake 4 with the shiny mapping and bump mapping back with a video card that only supported DX 8.</p>

            <p>To say that DirectX upgrades are shams is, IMO, completely innacurate. When done properly, the upgrades can be utilized to create great graphical improvements.</p>

<p>Directx 10 vs 11 (DX10 has minimal tessellation compared to DX11, keep that in mind, its closer to the first pic):<br>

            <p>OP, before you buy a game, Make sure your PC can even run it. A good place to figure that out is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare the  system requirements with your rig yourself or the easier</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://cyri.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cyri.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/</a><br>
They list alot of games, what it does is you look for your game (if the list has it, and it probably will) and the sight scans your PC and tell you what meets the min/rec requirements and what doesn’t.</li>
</ol>

            <p>9600’s aren’t bad for around $100, plays pretty much everything, except ARMA 2, on max or at least high settings. I have one and if your looking for a good card for your money this is it.</p>

<p>Just some info from what I’ve experienced…<br>
dell xps 720 dual core 2.66<br>
vista 32 bit<br>
4 gig ram (i know 3)<br>
upgraded to an nvidia gtx 275 oc (from a geforce 8800 ultra)<br>
thats when all my source games would stutter (sound) and hang…<br>
I installed riva tuner and UNDER clocked my core clock to about 600, and now alls well with my games…<br>
hope that helps…</p>

            <p>well the problem I have with Ati is they they still push out beta drivers and publish them as stable releases. At this time I cant bring myself to purchasing a nVidia card because the price to performance gap is staggering but I am normally willing to spend a little more on a nVidia card because I know that the drivers will work.</p>

            <p>Almost definitely AGP… Sony Vaio - I’d dare to even say onboard GFX…</p>
<p>Socket 478 CPU and DDR RAM…</p>
<p>Try and find a cheap ebay bundle that someone is selling after an upgrade… ?</p>

            <p>While I HAVE an 8800 GTS (a kinda funny rare model with 640MB video ram), and I’m about to replace it with a 250 GTS, it’s not for a performance boost, since I’ve actually seen benchmarking that puts the 250 BARELY ahead of the 8800.</p>
<p>Really, they just kinda made the hardware more power efficient and cooler between the GeForce 8800 and 250.  Still, it’ll beat having a potentially breaking video card (my friend accidentally broke mine, and then repaired it, but it’s probably succumbing to the long-term stress of the incident and causing a lot of system crashes).</p>
<p>OP, get a new computer.  Go to <a href="http://Newegg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Newegg.com</a> and look for gaming computers.</p>

            <p>+1 to Orpheon for awesome reply.</p>
<p>I don’t have a whole lot of money right now - maybe towards the end of the year I’ll upgrade my RAM but for now I’m fine with scraping by with the bare minimum. I really don’t mind playing with lowest settings - I do it all the time  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>This isn’t really my computer - it’s the family one. I don’t think I’ll swap CPU or get a new computer (  :rolleyes:  ) lol. I looked online for my particular VAIO and apparantly it’ll take up to 4 GB of RAM. Sometime later this week I’ll look inside for the slots because I couldn’t find that info online.</p>
<p>But yeah, the nVidia GEforce 250 looks good. If it fits I’ll get it probably.</p>

            <p>I would recommend upgrading your CPU to something more modern (You can get a Quad 2.5Ghz CPU for $150 over at <a href="http://neweegg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">neweegg.com</a>!). A RAM boost would be a good idea also 4GB is good. For G-cards I prefer Readon just because of it’s better pricing over Nvidia, Nvidia does have nicer drivers though.</p>
<p>If you want Nvidia G-cards go for the Geforce 250’ish and above cards or if you want Readon G-cards go for the 57xx and above G-cards. Biggest problem is if you don’t have the right motherboard sockets PCI-E 2.0 x16 is what you need for newer G-cards and LGA 775 CPU socket for anything above a single-core CPU. If you don’t have those you’ll need a new computer, although if you follow my advice you’ll basically have a new computer.</p>
<p>My specs are:<br>
Core 2 Quad 2.4Ghz CPU<br>
4GB of DDR2 RAM<br>
(Proud of this one.) Readon 5870<br>
And about 8 case fans all 120mm or above.</p>
<p>I can play Crysis with flawless performance but i don’t usually push the graphics much just the standard 4x AA and 8x AF. Uggh stupid internet froze when posting, sry for the double post.</p>
