    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/elevator-crash-in-unforeseen-consequences/11196</link>
    <description>Does anyone feel bad for the people who fall down the elevator in Unforeseen Consequences now? Title cut-off. &gt; :frowning: 

The people in the elevator actually sound scared for their lives, unlike Half-Life 1 where they just do these emotionless screams when falling. I really love how they put more emotional depth into the characters.</description>

<p>It`s theyr own fault for panicking in critical situation. As I approached that lift, I took a look and noticed that this is a open lift, so they could have climbed it off to get on ladder.<br>
Hah.</p>

<p>I thought the voices during the elevator crash were taken straight from a movie. Someone please tell me I’m wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re wrong.</p>
<p>If they took it from a movie there could be legal issues with royalties.  Of course, the devs are not making money, so they could argue that it comes under ‘fair use’ laws, but would they really want to have to go through all that potential bullshit when they could just spend 30 minutes recording the dialogue with their own voice actors?</p>

            <p>I have to agree that the scene was a LOT more intense with the script and voice acting that BM team added there.</p>
<p>Still, gotta love the source engine. I used a barrel, but I also restarted and saved them once I realized you could throw objects in order to break glass. I’m currently going through the entire game trying to save every single scientist possible, using stacking to get to places so you can take out hazards ahead of time, or to block scientists from going someplace that would get them killed, etc.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve only been unable to save the scientists that keep getting eaten by the vents (bodycount = +4) and teh scientist that falls from the ladder in the elevator shaft (bodycount = +1) There’s also the scientist that kills the headcrab at the beginning of the game before getting attacked by another, but I SHOULD be able to save him, since it is possible to grab a flare, and toss it at the headcrab before it attacks him, but the headcrab just doesn’t register the hit, so (bodycount = +1)<br>
Every other scientist up through the end of office complex, I’ve been able to save, as well as about 3 - 4 security guards (can’t really call them barney’s anymore) though obviously I have to keep leaving them behind places.</p>

            <p>I much prefer breaking the glass… Without the crowbar I thought I had no choice but to press the button, and I felt <span class="bbcode-i">terrible</span> for causing the fall of those desperately stranded people…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I knew it was inevitable, but there’s a big difference between being present and being the trigger.</p>

            <p>I feel bad in either version because…you know…you press button = stuff that you don’t want to die, dies lol.</p>
<p>Though in BM it’s not as utterly random. You actually hear people on the elevator before it collapses in front of you. In the original, I pressed the button and was like “…da fuq just happened?” That was when the elevator flies down the shaft then I hear the scientists screams just before they hit the bottom.</p>

<p>Jajaja, that was amazing!<br>
Especially the scientist’s line: “¿Any idea what to do next?”, jajaja  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>That’s pretty awesome.</p>
<p>I like the new dialogue here but kinda missed the silly “AHHHHHHHHH! Hello Gordon.” as they fall in HL1.</p>

<p>I thought the voices during the elevator crash were taken straight from a movie. Someone please tell me I’m wrong.</p>

<p>It does sound like something from a final destination movie or something, only it’s actually scary.</p>

            <p>Well obviously you need to break the glass with <span class="bbcode-i">something</span>. I was just trying to say that jamming the elevator (while being awesome) is not necessary to trigger the glitch.</p>
