    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mutation-evolution-note/6295</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing with Source SDK, and accidentally noticed this note, placed on the top of Kleiner&#39;s corkboard. 
[img]https://img521.imageshack.us/img521/160/beztytuufkm.png[/img]

It say&#39;s &quot;Mutation Evolution?&quot; and there&#39;s a scheme of something that looks like fast headcrab to me. What do you thing about it? 

Before seeing that i thought that fast/poison headcrabs were made by combine, but it suggests that they were not developed by combine (kleiner surely would know) nor came from xen.

If there was a thread about it, i did not found it.</description>

<p>Didn’t know that, but judging by the rate humans have sex its no wonder those that were fertile more often had kids more often, leading to a rapid rise in frequently-fertile-females :jizz: :3</p>

<p>The thing that troubles me in this, is what could possibly alter a living creature in such rapid manner? These headcrab’s have very big differences, and yet it took them only some years, instead of millions of years.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I like to think the headcrab was originally a symbiotic creature rather than a parasite. It “coupled” with some other kind of organism (animal, plant, fungi, whatever), for which they both received a mutual benefit, and the headcrabs mistake humans for that organism. Zombies are asymmetric, which is rarely found in nature, so it looks as if something the headcrab is doing isn’t functioning how it’s supposed to when performed on a human. Perhaps the headcrab secreted chemicals that caused beneficial growth and development in the organism, and the same chemicals when used on a human mutate them horribly, because they were never meant to change in the way this organism does.</p>

<p>I’m not saying it’s a bad choice of weapon, or wondering why they do it. I merely wonder, if the normal headcrabs work so well ( they clearly do), and you still have the job of clearing out the zombies, why make things harder for yourself.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be a design choice because normal headcrabs aren’t good enough, and I’d much prefer to clear out normal zombies than have to go through fast and poison ones.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Being harder to clear out works both ways. They presumably use fast and poison headcrabs to make it harder for the rebels to survive and clear out the infestation. And they don’t necessarily always need to clear out the zombies at all - Ravenholm, for example, was bombarded with headcrab cannisters and then left to rot.</p>
<p>As for why they still use regular headcrabs when fast and poison ones are available, maybe the altered versions are more unstable or can’t be produced fast enough.</p>

            <p>oh I also forgot to mention that in hl2: Lost Coast the headcrab cannisters in the church only containned Poison headcrabs.</p>
<p>Also. The fast headcrabs are a more “non-mutated evolution like process” of the normal headcrab. Faster legs to attach in faster victims (humans running), A more cranium like head/torso wich could make it easier to attach on human heads. The poison headcrab instead has slower legs, a more easy to see colour, and is not sylent as the other two headcrabs. It’s head is also like the normal headcrab but bigger. To attach in other parts than host’s head. This is heavily difficult to evolve in just 20 years (20 since combine took the control of earth is when Gordon arrives). Also it had a “frontal mouth” to show to it’s victims. A quality that any other kind of headcrab, even gonarchs have.</p>

<p>so many teories @.@</p>
<p>I just think that with a completely new environment full of vegetation and “hosts” the headcrabs could evolve easily to fast headcrabs and I think the poison one is mutated by the combine. I mean… It’s the first headcrab that I see attaching to host’s back, with a different colour than the original and even with the skill of attaching to the roof (episode 2 if you open a door in a room when you have to disable a generator, a poison headcrab attacks you dettaching from a roof.) Also they have “poison” teeth or something in the mouth that allows them to infect their victims. That could be by evolution as the gonarch can throw acid.</p>

</aside>
<p>Interesting notes. I actually quite like this idea. Fast headcrabs being an evolution, whilst poison ones being combine mutation.</p>

            <p>That would be true, but the combine have used poison and fast headcrabs in their rockets as well. Fast in hl2, poison in the container during the strider fight in ep1.</p>

            <p>Yes piefish, if you don’t wan’t to join in our nerdy discussion on things that don’t exist then be gone with you!</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>It just kind of bugs me that some people keep repeating this so specifically. (calling combine soldiers mutants, humanoid-aliens &amp;/or human-alien hybrids gets on my nerves too)</p>

<p>Fair doos. I wouldn’t let it get to you, but petpeevs are petpeevs. I’m always trying to explain to people what the synths are.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Not really much of a difference except animations, and ribs that seem to go on forever.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well the arms seem much more mutated. They seem to eat through the maw, and in the HD pack they started growing green lumps on them like what the Gonomes have. ( Since when is this confirmed to be toxic waste? I always saw it as a sign of growth. )</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>What’s so bad about that? It doesn’t just protect the gonarch, but it protects themselves from their host as well as makes them stronger &amp; possibly provides them with nutrition.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, I suppose. It’s just less interesting to me in the end. I also wonder what the Gonarch has to protect itself from  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
I would find it much more interesting if they evolved from the creatures they attached to. That would make them imo truly diverse, and extremely able to adapt to any world they find themselves on ( assuming some form of DNA splicing occurs ).</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry, but that is just utterly ridiculous in how silly that idea is. Why would a headcrab need to attach itself to a biped only to turn back into a giant headcrab with an eggsack? Also note the fact that headcrabs &amp; vorts won’t even attack on another in HL1.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The Gonarch to me doesn’t look a thing like a headcrab. To me it looks like a vortzombie, turned into a Gonome turned into a { VERY LONG TIME } turned into a Gonarch. Why would it? Why not?<br>
To me, the idea that this creature evolved to take over other creatures simply for bodyguards just doesn’t seem right. I see it more as a super evolved parasite. There are parasites on earth that can take over fish and make them suicidal, all so they get eaten by bigger fish so they can start their reproductive cycle, in the bigger fish.</p>
<p>To grow from a headcrab to a Gonarch would take a very long time. It’d still take ages even if growing from a zombie. However we don’t see bigger headcrabs anywhere, so I assume the normal headcrabs we see are their largest size and to develop any further they have to attach to a host.</p>
<p>You realise that if headcrabs do grow bigger to the stage of a Gonarch, we haven’t seen them, they wouldn’t be able to attach to anything, and would generally be a bigger target that couldn’t fit and hide anywhere. Also, there would be tons of them. Although the idea of a giant headcrab acting like an attack dog is a damn freaky thought.</p>
<p>Yes I forgot about headcrabs not attacking vorts in HL:1. However they do in HL:2 and it’s episodes, so I’d put that down to an oversight with programming<br>
and not knowing how the story would go.</p>
<p>Hell, perhaps the Nihilanth didn’t use slave collars when he first took over the Vorts, just the slaver drones (?). Perhaps they were designed to inhibit headcrabs once he realised his Vorts were getting taken over and went on a major attempt at extinction once he discovered the ball biting scariness of what they turn into.</p>
<p>(That’s my theory in a nutshell, I would love to see the headcrab labs in Black Mesa ( No not the gamma labs ))</p>
<p>P.S if any of that comes across as angry debating rather than discussing I do apologise. I do enjoy these nerdy discussions.</p>

<p>It just kind of bugs me that some people keep repeating this so specifically. (calling combine soldiers mutants, humanoid-aliens &amp;/or human-alien hybrids gets on my nerves too)</p>

<p>What’s so bad about that? It doesn’t just protect the gonarch, but it protects themselves from their host as well as makes them stronger &amp; possibly provides them with nutrition.</p>

<p>I always thought of the Gonarch as a mutated Vortigaunt. Think about it, they are the only creature we see that would be a suitable host ( bar Race X ). However they would be extremely difficult for a headcrab to attach to, due to their natural abilities with electricity, which is why I figured we never see headcrabvorts, and we only see one Gonarch, they are that rare.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m sorry, but that is just utterly ridiculous in how silly that idea is. Why would a headcrab need to attach itself to a biped only to turn back into a giant headcrab with an eggsack? Also note the fact that headcrabs &amp; vorts won’t even attack on another in HL1.</p>

<p>They’re just taller, faster, stronger &amp; throw gunk from their chest. (exactly like bullsquids) Even then we don’t know if that’s a part of their life cycle or if they were just mutated by the toxic waste that can be seen in their backs.</p>

<p>That’s actually a pretty reasonable argument.</p>

</aside>
<p>They look more like ordinary fingers to me, only elongated. Either way, it could be done via altering DNA, but it could just as easily explained by chemical effect on the tissue without any DNA change at all. Maybe it’s producing chemicals that stimulates growth or weakens the cartilage between bones, causing them to stretch. We don’t know for a fact. It’s just the constant use of DNA is what gets me.</p>

<p>There weren’t any zombies found on Xen, the only place the Gonarch was found. Yet there was zombies all over earth in HL1 &amp; 2. More likely than not, the Gonarch is a final life-cycle stage of a headcrab that doesn’t have a host.</p>

<p>Lmao. That needs to be a mod. But sadly no, I think the Gonarch has lost it’s ability to attach to hosts by the time it reaches that age.</p>

<p>Well, it can change the biological structure of it’s host somehow, I assume it’s some form of DNA changing toxin or something, released once ‘coupling’ has happened in order to start ‘maturing’. ( assuming )</p>

</aside>
<p>I always saw the Half-Life series as one that took the science fairly seriously ( yeah I know the idiocy in that statement ). Radiation kills all carbon based life forms, it doesn’t mutate them ( at least not to that kind of degree ). Although considering we are talking about aliens anything is possible.</p>
