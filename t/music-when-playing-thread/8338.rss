    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/music-when-playing-thread/8338</link>
    <description>I was just wondering, if you guys listen to the music, when playing some game....if yes, what kind of? 

As for me, it´s usually rock or hardrock, like Three days grace or Rev theory  :slight_smile:   


The latest artist i´m listening to, when playing:

<p>Quake 2 OST</p>

</aside>
<p>That was a good soundtrack, one of the few I’d add to my regular playlist.</p>
<p>I’ll usually play the game’s music the first time through, or in a game like Skyrim for the first couple dozen hours.  After that, I’m usually bored of it, and play some other music.</p>
<p>MP games I’ll more often than not play my own music over whatever the game does (or doesn’t) play.</p>

            <p>oh fuck yes</p>
<p>I didn’t even play fallout1/2 before FO3 and when I replaced the OST with a pack with the original music</p>
<p>It was fucking amazing.</p>
<p>Fallout 3’s default music didn’t really fit the setting IMO. Some of it sounded a little like Crysis music actually.</p>

            <p>Really depends on the game. Sometimes I throw on the BF2 MEC music during BF3 on Oman or Karkand, because the song is so badass, and because BF3’s music ain’t too good.<br>

<p>The only SP game I have ever put soundtracks on for is Duke Nukem Forever, I put Duke3D music when I was trying to play it because the actual game music was annoying as hell, and Skyrim, because I got tired of the music so I put on some music from other TES games.</p>

            <p>Sometimes. Depends on the game. As with others it’s mostly in multiplayer games where the sound isn’t generally improtant. Especially MMOs and such.</p>
<p>I generally just throw on a Bach organ piece, or Mozart’s requiem. Feels epic as all hell blasting people to some bombastic pipes or fourty people choir-ing in latin.</p>
<p>Either that or I just watch some TV-shows on my secondary screen. EPIC MULTI TASKING!</p>

            <p>Most of the time, as long as it’s not awful, I will listen to what the game’s soundtrack has to offer.<br>
However, I have played through the following games with the following replacement soundtracks, thanks to xbox’s music feature and old PC games’ ability to suck music from the disc tray.</p>
<p>Mass Effect- A compilation of swing and big band tracks</p>
<p>Dead Space- Tubeway Army: Replicas</p>
<p>Half-Life- Man Man: Six Demon Bag<br>
[/SIZE]<br>
Also, I never play Halo: Reach multiplayer unless the Quake 2 OST is on.</p>

            <p>Most of the time I’ll listen to whatever music the game plays. Other times, if it’s a game I’ve played a ton or if I’ve heard the music in game far too much I’ll play something else.</p>
<p>A trick I used to do was plugging one console in the Video AV and another in the Audio AV ports. So I could play Sonic Heroes while playing music from Burnout 3: Takedown, or Sonic Adventure 2: Battle with Burnout: Revenge.</p>
<p>Recently though I just use my awesome-o computer speakers and turn down the volume on the game. For instance, during the Palamacia chapter of Final Fantasy XIII I start playing the soundtrack for “Deus Ex: Human Revolution” through the computer.</p>

            <p>I only play other music when playing puzzle games that don’t need sound to be able to play properly, otherwise it’s always the game’s own soundtracks and sound effects.</p>
<p>As for the type of music, it’s whatever I feel like listening to.</p>

            <p>House, Electronica, Drum and Bass, Trance, some good Dubstep, some rap (rarely), sometimes rock/metal like Disturbed. Generally more electric music, it can be fast which is great for fast paced games and PvPing, or slow which is good for not making me rage in League of Legends. lol</p>

            <p>I was just wondering, if you guys listen to the music, when playing some game…if yes, what kind of?</p>
<p>As for me, it´s usually rock or hardrock, like Three days grace or Rev theory  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
