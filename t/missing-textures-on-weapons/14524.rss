    <title>Missing textures on weapons</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/missing-textures-on-weapons/14524</link>
    <description>I recently downloaded the new update to Black Mesa unfortunately the update broke my weapons  such as the pistol,the Shotgun,Mp5,Crossbow,Rocket Launcher,Grenades,Tripmine,Snarks and the gluon gun. All those weapons have this disgusting purple and black texture. Is there any fix for this situation. Thanks</description>
