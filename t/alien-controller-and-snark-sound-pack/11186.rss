    <title>Alien controller and snark sound pack</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/alien-controller-and-snark-sound-pack/11186</link>
    <description>This is a pack I have made that I feel atleast greatly improves the sounds that are made by the alien controllers and the snarks. They were in my opinion the weakest sounding npc&#39;s.

The snarks sounds have made me laugh quite alot but It&#39;s not only funny but cool.

The Alien controller now squeals and hisses and screams like he is supposed to.

The sounds are custom made by myself and not taken from any Valve product so they can be integrated with no copyright boundaries

Check them out and If you like then add them to the overall sound mod I think it&#39;s an improvement.

Please let us know what you think.... Link Below

<p>They sound pretty low quality and grainy, and some of the sounds don’t seem to fit the characters either.</p>

<p>I know where you are coming from on this and I don’t think this applys to the snark sound effects either.</p>
<p>The problem I had was that I could not actually hear the sounds the controllers were making in the teleport chamber in Lambda core. So I made the sounds louder so I could hear the sound effects that I put up so you could hear them over all the noise in there.</p>
<p>What I probably should have done though was keep the sounds I made at a normal level and reduce the sounds of the teleport chamber machine a bit as this is too loud. So I may re-do these sounds at there normal levels but with the teleport chamber sounds turned down.</p>
<p>I used a mixture of BMS sounds and some my own or both mixed together in some cases</p>
<p>also if you listen to the original sounds of alien controllers the BMS ones sound nothing like it where I think mine do resemble the original more closely but are different</p>

            <p>Updated this post with a video preview of the sounds… I think a lot of people really did not give any feedback because the lack of a preview so the sounds can be heard here.</p>
