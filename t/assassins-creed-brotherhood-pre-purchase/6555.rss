<p>I do encourage you to work for a games company or even talk to someone who does. They’ll tell you exactly how piracy discourages them from release on pc. You only need to search for why Epic didn’t do gears pc 2 and 3, and why we have to settle with a Crysis 2 that looks worse than its prequel. But hey who cares right. Lets just all pirate so that we’ll be forced to all get gayboxes and pay for playing our games online. Fucking nihilists.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, consider how Crysis 1 had the SecuROM security suite protecting the game. Remember the backdraft on the internet about that one? It was pretty much corporate-sponsored malware that penetrates into the registry of your computer and guts it looking for copy utilities. And then grants you limited re-installs that you have to clear with the company if you exceed their allotted amount.</p>
<p>When you look at it from that angle, it looks like we’re effectively paying subscription fees to use the games that WE paid for. Is it any wonder that internet hack-houses like the Pirate Bay are cracking these games? These companies are violating both our rights to privacy and the very security of our systems.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s the matter of ACII and Splinter Cell: Conviction having DRM that you have to be constantly connected to the internet for, otherwise we can’t play. I am currently on a connection that cuts off after the day’s bandwidth is used up. If I have to connect to the internet to run the game and continue exchanging data throughout, then my bandwidth allotment will dry up within minutes of starting the game.</p>
<p>Not that this is the case with everyone, but it’s absurd that such DRM exists. Like I said earlier, it’s practically like buying a subscription to <span class="bbcode-i">your</span> own copy of the game that <span class="bbcode-i">you</span> bought and should be able to play at <span class="bbcode-i">your</span> discretion, without having to worry about security holes, privacy violating DRM, and bandwidth concerns.</p>
<p>I for one think that such a model is ridiculous. At least Steam has an offline mode and built in cheat protection. I’ve bought a large percentage of my PC games through it, and the library can follow me between computers. (I wish iTunes could do that.)</p>
<p>EDIT: Just as a brief note, I’ve never pirated a game in my life.</p>

            <p>Edit: Actually that was off topic, I’m going to finish by saying you can take your high horse elsewhere.</p>
<p>On Topic: I believe I have neglected to mention that just because I’ll pirate it doesn’t mean I won’t buy it at a later date.</p>

            <p>Right, but Ubi listened and have striped their drm from all their latest pc titles including Ass Bro. Also, saying you pirate because Ubi inconvenienced you by not releasing all at once is not a valid excuse for stealing.</p>

            <p>This is both off-topic and related, but today when I woke up and went to the bathroom, I noticed there wasn’t any running water, so I went and checked the water counter outside. To my surprise the water counter device was of the “Altaïr” brand or model.</p>
<p>I was like, what the fuck, this is so cool!</p>
<p>There isn’t still any running water and I really want to take a bath btw  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>I don’t think they are going to make a crazy annoying DRM system.  I bet they simply did it to stop PC piracy from impacting console game sales.</p>
<p>Although I think that this will have an impact akin to the DRM.  It just alienates users and they also missed out on holiday season release because of it which is why I am not buying it.</p>
<p>Ubisoft needs to learn that the best anti-pirate measure is product value not delayed releases and annoying DRM.</p>
