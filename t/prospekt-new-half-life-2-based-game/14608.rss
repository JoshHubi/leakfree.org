    <title>Prospekt - new Half Life 2 based game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/prospekt-new-half-life-2-based-game/14608</link>
    <description>So a new game called [url=&#39;https://prospektgame.com/&#39;]Prospekt[/url] has been released on [url=&#39;https://store.steampowered.com/app/399120/&#39;]Steam[/url].

it is made by one guy, called Richard Seabrook.

In short:
The entire game is a sequel to the Half Life: Opposing Force game.
You play as Adrian Shepherd, an US Marine that has been teleported
to the Half Life 2 time and space to help out Gordon Freeman in the Nova
Prospekt Combine prison.

I am definitely interested in it, and i am gonna try it out.

What do you guys think?</description>

<p>I didn’t know there is an option to refund. Well lucky me I read the opinions first.<br>
Well too bad, the idea was promising.</p>

<p>He must’ve been very sure that it will be a success, but IIRC he hasn’t worked on any mods until now, there was just no way he could pull this off, not from the first attempt, or at least without any public beta and improve it based on player feedback.</p>

            <p>Plus in OpFor, you the player, knew that you were playing the role of Shephard, prospekt really could’ve been any person in the entire universe helping Gordon, there was not enough foundation in the provided story to cement Shepherd into the timeline.</p>
<p>And totally agreed with crypt on the mapping side, I was cringing so much at a lot of the decisions made in the design, it consisted of a few areas that had been polished to look pretty in screenshots and trailer while other areas were just crap, like seriously just useless areas that had no time or effort put into why this space existed.</p>
<p>The guy maybe asking for feedback on steam now but it’s a little late, he should’ve been doing this during development from a closed group, there are teams of people out there that do this for Source mods which would’ve greatly helped him, hell I bet if he asked any decent modder for a bit of feedback he would’ve got it.</p>
<p>I would love to turn my hobby into a job I really would, but I have been working for years to establish what I do while working a day job, I just can’t understand how 2 years of full time work resulted in this.</p>
<p>I hate bashing another developer, it’s not something I enjoy doing but this is a effectively a product that people paid for (yes refunds yada yada yada) a higher level should’ve been aimed for but this wasn’t the case, this looks like stuff I see on /r/hammer when a newish mapper is asking for feedback and advice.</p>
<p>Anyway, apologies, rants over, let’s see what he does next and if he can actually salvage what could’ve been.</p>

            <p>True enough. I’d been hearing so much news about this thing, even before it got onto Steam Greenlight, I was really expecting something amazing.<br>
But as for the environments, my guess is that it’s supposed to be like Opposing Force, in that Shepard is unknowingly assisting Gordon throughout the game. so the same environments makes sense. But OF also had a ton of unique environments.</p>

            <p>I disagree, from what I’ve seen, he technically knows how to operate Hammer, but has no idea what constitutes a decent map or gameplay. I bet many beginner mappers come up with a better Nova Prospekt in a week or two. I won’t dock him points for Xen being an eyesore (even though I should) because that sort of thing I can see being difficult to do decently, but HL2 is over a decade old, mimicking it’s done-to-death environments (the worst ones, no less) in a sub-par way isn’t the best way to go about creating good maps.</p>
<p>I don’t know how much experience he has, but he needs much more practice before trying to make it his day job. <span class="bbcode-i">God,</span> I can’t believe he supposedly quit his job and worked on this <span class="bbcode-i">full-time for 2 years</span> and it’s so unpolished.</p>

            <p>From what I’ve seen, I can say this much:<br>
This guy seems to be a good map maker, but has no skill in making custom models or textures.<br>
That dilemma is exactly why I don’t release maps. It’s not easy to create something original, and high quality, with limited resources.</p>

<p>Thing is, was there a free version of this beforehand? Because if there was there would’ve been feedback to improve it, this appears to be more of a first release to players of any kind, doesn’t even seem play tested.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thats’it , the main problem of this mod is that we did not have  any kind of free version or trial version to test it,so he got 0 feedback from us about level desigh and gameplay.</p>

            <p>I never expected the game to be great either. All the trailer showed were a couple of reskins and new particle effects, way to few to raise up any kind of hype.</p>
<p>May be his dream and so on, and I respect that, but, it didn’t live up to the expectations. The game is a disappointment.</p>

<p>And this. I personally agree with his opinion.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be mean, but these are just the facts.</p>

            <p>Yes,its poorly designed,yes AI is pretty stupid and yes this mod is too short  for his price.But,have mercy, he worked on this for 2 years,this is his job, a dream,so you just invest in his future.It’s some kind of charity in my opinion.Give him a chance.</p>

            <p>Xen was a big disappointment. You know something’s wrong when it looks uglier than games made 18 years ago. Jeez, I could make something better than this <span class="bbcode-s">(in black mesa)[/size]</span>!</p>

<p>There. Made it in about 3 hours, It’s not perfect, never intended to be, but the point is source engine is capable of doing better than… <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=627217450" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> (disclaimer: i did not take ‘this’ pic, was taken from google). And even if it wasn’t for godrays, it still would look better. And it makes a smile on my face.</p>

            <p>Yeah, reviews are basically saying exactly what I was expecting. Again, I’ll pass.</p>

            <p>Well the game is out now, and apparently it got pretty negative reviews like this one for example.</p>

<p>HL2 mod that looks about the same as your average HL2 mod a decade ago, priced at HL2’s level.<br>
I think I’ll pass. Perhaps later on if the reviews are overwhelmingly positive I’ll give it a second look, but as it stands it seems I’ve already played plenty of its type. Looking at it I seriously doubt this mod will offer anything unique or interesting that deviates from your run of the mill HL2-based mod.</p>

<p>My exact thoughts, unfortunately.</p>
