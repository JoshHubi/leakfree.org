    <title>Game &amp; SDK 2007 installed, game will not start</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-sdk-2007-installed-game-will-not-start/12882</link>
    <description>So I decided to play the mod from the beginning today, and it wouldn&#39;t start. I figured maybe something got corrupted, so I reinstalled steam and the whole game and source. I have the mod installed using the installer, and in the default directory recommended. Source SDK base 2007 is also installed. 

When I click play game, I can see in task manager that the &quot;hl2.exe&quot; starts up, runs up to about 25mb, then poofs away. I can&#39;t figure out what I&#39;m doing wrong. I followed all of the installation instructions.</description>

            <p>There was something wrong with or related to the source base, because it would not even start by itself, it would throw out weird errors whenever I tried to start it up. I ended up reloading my computer from scratch, and whatever was causing the problem is gone now.</p>

            <p>Try running the SDK Base 2007 itself from the Tools menu in Steam first, and quit once you see the main menu. Then, try loading BM.</p>
