Map: bm_c3a2h
Game version: default (december 2017)
Everything returned to normal after restarting the game.
I don&#39;t know why that happened, all I can say is that I played the game a bit speedy by rushing through it.</description>

<p>Anyway, some objects float, some fall through the floor.<br>
But the most interesting thing was that the object that was moving,<br>
once touched another object would make them move the same way.</p>
<p>It was like bowling with barrels.</p>
