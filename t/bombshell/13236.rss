From the creators of 2013’s Rise of the Triad comes Bombshell, an isometric action role-playing game for PC and PlayStation 4. Bomb Disposal Specialist turned mercenary for hire, Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison must strong-arm her away across 4 planets in an Unreal Engine-powered galatic adventure to rescue the president from an apocalyptic alien threat. With out-of-this-world enemies, a never-before-seen arsenal of devastating weaponry and a host of genre-crossing mechanics, Bombshell is set to blow you away.

[align=center][b]KEY FEATURES[/b][/SIZE]
[b]History in the Breaking[/b]
Be part of Bombshell’s debut as she fights to save her president and her people from a maniac’s mechanical monstrosity.

[b]Brave New Worlds[/b]
Traverse the dying world of Kyrron as it’s consumed by its neighboring sun, discover the secrets of a civilization frozen in time on the distant world of Zeroth and travel to the epitome of technology -- a villain’s vision which threatens to consume all that exists.

[b]Robot-Armed and Dangerous[/b]
Shell, shock and shatter your way through vicious, bloodthirsty predators, an augmented alien species, and the remnants of an ancient race re-animated, with more than 10 weaponized arm modifications.

[b]Isometric Ingenuity[/b]
Brilliantly brutal top-down shooting layered with classic role-playing mechanics, including experience points, upgrades, side quests, and non-linear levels.

[b]Heavy Handed[/b]
Fierce finishing moves and interactive environments make Bombshell as dynamic as she is deadly.

[b]What Are You Lookin’ At?[/b]
Yeah, she has a metal arm. Deal with it.[/align]

            <p>Teaser was pretty bad, graphics don’t look bad though, and I like the armored alien designs in that screen (though they seem to be tweaks of Duke Nukem aliens given this was a Duke game before the legal issues popped up)</p>
<p>Hate her hair though</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>lol you can literally see the Duke Nukem Ripper chaingun in the soldiers hands in the screens</p>

            <p>I am pretty excited about this because I knew about Bombshell as a cut sidekick from Duke Nukem Forever. To see her getting her own game (even her own IP) is awesome for me.</p>
<p>Her design looks pretty badass to me.</p>

<p>Yeah, it could easily have been cut down a bit and it would’ve done so much for it. I did enjoy her design though.</p>

            <p>rexcellent to see a violent female protagonist and female prez in the same game.</p>
<p>Her design looks like it was drawn by a teenage boy in 1997, though. Aside from that it looks like fun</p>
