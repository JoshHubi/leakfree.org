            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask about the soundtrack and lo and behold, a thread about the soundtrack at the top. Just going to “highjack” the thread here, hope that’s ok.</p>
<p>My question concerns red tape, specifically in the music world. I know that Mr. Nielsen is selling his (excellent) take on the HL soundtrack. But did he/the devs have to get a license or permission from Valve for this? How would that work? I know there are platforms like Loudr that let you make and sell cover songs. But what constitutes as a cover? Can I just upload a cover if I don’t make any money from it… I find this convoluted.</p>
<p>I’d appreciate some insight on this. I’m a big fan of soundtracks, and I’m thinking of making a personal HL1 tribute album of sorts (kind of like what this guy has done for Doom: <a href="https://www.perkristian.net/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.perkristian.net/</a>). And I’d like to be able to share it some day without any legal issues.</p>
<p>Btw, can’t wait for ‘Black Mesa’ to go retail. Looking forward to another playthrough, and also with Xen this time. I’m sure it’s going to be sweet.  :lambda:   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I understand, and that’s fine! I guess I was just saying, in case you never played BM before, to just try it out with the BM music before you try switching stuff around.</p>
<p>But yeah, like Crypt said, most of the songs don’t really carry over, but you’re welcome to try.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  I’d certainly try a mod like that out.</p>

            <p>Very little of BM is 1:1 with Half-Life, that includes music and music cues. I outlined something similar <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=590400&amp;postcount=4" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">earlier today,</a> actually ^_^. It was technically the inverse goal, but still the same more or less.</p>

            <p>I like bms’ music for the most part, but I believe that some tracks like nuclear mission jam are better than the tracks in the game. I don’t want to sound like the the music in bms is bad, I really don’t,but some just don’t really fit my taste  and I was wondering if the music in bms is 1:1 with hl1’s</p>

            <p>You can replace the songs in the sound file with any music you like. The only issue is that not all of the places in BM with music match HL’s music 1:1, so you’ll need toeither deal with that, or re-map certsin levels so music triggers are where you want.</p>
<p>All of that being said, I think BM’s music fits BM better than HL’s will. Just like you wouldn’t want BM’s music in HL. Unless you already played the game and want to try something different, I say just leave the music alone.</p>
