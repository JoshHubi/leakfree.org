    <description>how incredibly awesome would that be? i would cum-lol-rofl-over 9000 if they put that into EP3. ive played a mod in Half life 2: EP 2 where you could use the portal gun and though it made it incredibly easy, it was incredibly fun too. i keep saying incredibly... ^_^</description>

            <p>Thanks for the worthless bump. It was in Opposing Force, which is gearbox territory, so the odds of them ever using it again is about zero. It was just a BFG knock-off with a wuss-out feature built in that sends you to xen. Xen was one of the biggest criticisms of HL1, so they didn’t bring it back &amp; obviously still won’t.</p>
<p>Also it didn’t have any use for puzzles at all. Those were arbitrarily placed telepads.</p>

            <p>With Portal 2 being officially different than Episode 3, and Episode 3 being the continuation of Half-Life 2 + episodes, and Portal 1 being a puzzle game, significantly different to the Half-Life series, I doubt this would happen. If you think the way Valve thinks, they it would make sense to keep the two games separate. Anyway, I don’t think a mere Episode would bring a significant change to gameplay. The gravity gun didn’t change gameplay as much as the portal gun would, and even the gravity gun was introduced in Half-Life 2, a major new game and not just a mere Episode or extension. It would be fun, but it would significantly deviate from what the two games are about. Maybe in Episode 3 we will have teleportation and some Xen again, like in HL1, but I doubt the portal gun would appear significantly. Maybe you’ll see someone use it, or you’ll have it for a limited amount of time, who knows, but I would expect such a big change to be introduced in something like Half-Life 3.</p>

            <p>Well, It would be awsome if they left out the gravity gun and made a mix between the gravity gun and the portal gun. Tell me the truth, wouldn’t that be awsome? Sure, it would be more advanced to controll, but it would be awsome. :freeman:</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]EDIT: [COLOR=‘Black’] I think that it’s obvious though that you will see some Aperture technology from Borealis. It would be nice to see those cloning-pods with chell in them that appeared in Portal TFV map pack. And another thing, have everyone forgot the Black Mesa Portal Gun from Half-Life Opposong Force?? It was similar to the portalgun, you press the primary trigger and shoot a portal-sphere, or you press the secondary trigger and teleport to Xen and back. We could see that “portalgun” in EP3 too, right? :freeman:<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]EDIT 2:[COLOR=‘Black’]This gave me an idéa, Super Toast is right, the portalgun would be useless to gordon, exept for shooting a portal at one wall and exit another wall, but the O.F. portalgun (modified) would be more useful, for example, you shoot one sphere at one place and another sphere next to you, walk into the sphere and come out from the other one, that would take away the falling porblems!</p>

<p>Unlike Chell, poor Gordon would snap every bone he has if he missed a portal while flying though the air at high speeds. Slowing down without dying to land somewhere would be a bit of an issue as well. While there’s a chance that Valve might pull an HEV suit modification straight out of their asses to make Gordon immune (either temporarily or permanently) to fall damage the same way Chell is with her leg springs, I just don’t see it happening.</p>
<p>I think, if <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span>, perhaps Gordon may encounter a primitive prototype of the portal gun that will have limited function, and would break when the sequence it’s needed for is over.</p>
<p>But, really, if a full-fledged usable portal gun appears and functions exactly like it did in Portal, I would be somewhat disappointed. To me, it would feel like Valve spent all of those years essentially mashing the two games together.</p>
<p>Granted, I’d probably still enjoy it quite a bit.</p>

            <p>I’m just gonna let valve decide, you’re all saying that the gun would ruin the game, but since valve has thousands of beta testers, I’m sure that the game will be epic no matter what.</p>

            <p>I have an idea. Let’s just leave it at Portal Easter Egg’s in the Aperture Science envirenment.</p>
<p>Maybe some blueprints of GlaDos. A few coffee mugs. Some broken parts of rubble from the enrichment centre etc.</p>

<p>More likely because it’s a convenient plot device, rather then as a means of incorporating a game mechanic.</p>

<p>Yes, because that automatically implies that you get the portal gun. Because you get to use everything in the Half-life universe, like the combine sniper rifle and APC.  :rolleyes:</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not saying you’ll necessarily be able to use it.  It just makes sense that you’ll be interacting with that mechanic in some way as Gordon, seeing as they introduced a whole new character and mechanic within the HL universe.  They could have just as easily made it a new, unrelated universe and that would quell any possibility of the two interacting.  But they didn’t. :3</p>
