    <description>Is there anyone here that remembers the &quot;Red letter day&quot; back in February? (If not, read more; [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/groups/messagetovalve#announcements/detail/1209451121185662422&#39;]https://steamcommunity.com/groups/messagetovalve#announcements/detail/1209451121185662422[/url]
I&#39;m asking around because I&#39;m, as the title suggests, interested in if there is interest enough to do it again. Please share your thoughts!</description>

            <p>Nobody is really interested here since we’ve got BM out and other extensions in the pipeline coming soon.</p>
<p>Better ask in the steamforum.</p>

<p>Well, that’s why I posted a link, you take a look at that group and you’ll see it does have 60000+ members, and we already did this before, with success. And what did you mean by “episode came out a few months back”? Because it most certainly did not.</p>

            <p>Episode 3 came out a few months back, get with the times.</p>
<p>There’s seriously people that annoyed at this? Valve’s working on the next Half-Life game, they know where they want to go with the plot, it’s not the last in the Half-Life story arc, they don’t want to show anything in case it changes majorly and you’ll get more information when they’re ready to give more. What more could you want? I don’t see anyone petitioning any other game developer due to their “lack of communication.”</p>
