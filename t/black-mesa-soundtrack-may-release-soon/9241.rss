    <title>Black mesa soundtrack may release soon..</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-soundtrack-may-release-soon/9241</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;m a lurker for about 2 years, and probably posted this in the wrong place cause i hardly posted on here or don&#39;t know the website to well surprisingly, but I thought it would be cool to know about this update to the Joel Nielsen Black mesa soundtrack page. I know people may know about it and sorry if its old news. Remember that the page ISN&#39;T public yet but the last 2 paragraphs in the page lead me to believe that the soundtrack might go up soon (hopefully). 

Il quote &quot;After seven years, hundreds of hours and too many song revisions to count, the Black Mesa Soundtrack is finally released&quot; 

but keep in mind that the page is NOT public witch means that we shouldn&#39;t even be worrying about it until the page is public. i acknowledge that the page isn&#39;t public yet in my defense.. 

I&#39;l quote: &quot;This page is not yet public. Therefore there are no active links for the music&quot;

if everybody already seen it then my bad  :slight_smile:

<blockquote>
<p>The soundtrack will be released two weeks before the mod. Just because the soundtrack is finalised doesn’t mean it is going to be available for download yet, which is what I already said:You’re reading into it too much.</p>

<p>This shouldn’t be in the show off section either…</p>
