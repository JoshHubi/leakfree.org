    <title>If you could have Portal Gun, what would you do with it?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/if-you-could-have-portal-gun-what-would-you-do-with-it/6583</link>
    <description>So, lets think with portals.

Since it is possible to create infinite fall mechanism by placing two portals one over another it would be possible to successfully build perpetuum mobile device, thus achieve infinite source of free energy. I would use that to assume leadership position as worldwide energy supplier by delivering it for free, which would establish absolute governments and companies dependence from me. Having that I would order to stop all wars and conflicts, and become everyones dear king of the world.  :slight_smile: 
But first, I would have some fun with it.  :wink: 

And you?</description>

<p>Wouldn’t all the water evaporate because there’s no air on the moon? And if you drain too much, there will be SEVERE DROUGHTS EVERYWHERE, not to mention enormous tidal waves and the world’s largest (and most deadly) whirlpool. :fffuuu: Not a good idea.</p>

            <p>I would create an orange portal to Toronto, Canada, and go on a deep sea adventure to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and create a blue one, then once I’ve demonstrated my power, then I’ll finally be able to paint my face on Big Ben, The Queen, Australia, and the moon! Then, I’ll run away with the Companion Cube, and fulfill an inanimate romance!</p>
