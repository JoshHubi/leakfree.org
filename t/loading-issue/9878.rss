    <description>Hi

Everything seems to be normal as I ride on the train until Loading happens. It seems that the map doesn&#39;t load properly as I end up being stuck outside the textures like after ending the noclip out of the map. However, when I enter map command into developer console it loads as it should. I believe it&#39;s an issue of the Loading event, because it&#39;s not just the matter of the first Loading event.

I already tried to reinstall BMS.

<p>I fixed BoosterGold’s issue, it should theoretically work for you as well.</p>
<p>If you are running Windows 7 and you have Steam installed to “Program Files”, you’re going to have to uninstall it and reinstall it to somewhere else, preferably C:\Games</p>
<p>Windows 7 locks down any applications installed to Program Files and it’s stopping Black Mesa from accessing the static player information needed to carry weapons over. You should be good to go after that.</p>

<p>For me this solution worked.</p>

            <p>I’ve reinstalled BMS from a different source, but I still get this issue.</p>
<p>I’d appreciate any help, it’s kinda shitty to load maps in developer console after ending one rather than automatically progress.</p>
