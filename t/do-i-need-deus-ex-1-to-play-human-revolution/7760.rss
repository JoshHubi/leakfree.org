<p>Illuminati ending is the best ending.</p>

<p>Just finished the game a few minutes ago. I went with Tong’s ending, but it was really a hard choice. Although apparently the sequel just kinda mashes all the endings together. But whatever, I’ve played the first one, and that’s enough for me to play Human Revolution now.</p>

            <p>Forgive me, my fellow gaming bretheren. I’ve been committing a terrible sin for quite some time. I had not played the original Deus Ex. But now I have turned from my evil ways and actually completed it. I hope this fair offering and my eternal devotion to Dei pleases you and him.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Black’]For those who don’t have a sense of homour\brain : I’ve recently bought DE and completed it.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the game stands alone quite well. Aside from a brief bit of the first game, Human Revolution was the first of the series that I finished. Absolutely superb from beginning to end, I might add, but the game is excruciatingly difficult to play if you come at it from a combat perspective. My first play-through I got “Foxiest of the Hounds,” so definitely play it stealth action your first time. Slow down, take in the atmosphere. It’s really one of the best games ever created.</p>

            <p>okay, cheers. I was mainly wondering having read the PC gamer review and how it talked about how the game’s ultimate meaning is how the events and context of the first game would be set in play.</p>

            <p>No. The new game is a prequel and apart from a few references, you’re not really missing anything if you haven’t played the first one.</p>
<p>However, I do recommend playing the original, nonetheless. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
