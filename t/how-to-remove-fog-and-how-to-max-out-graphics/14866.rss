    <title>How to remove fog and how to max out graphics?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-remove-fog-and-how-to-max-out-graphics/14866</link>
    <description>Hi,

I recently got this game.

In the game there seems to be a lot of fog used at least in the early levels. Is there a way to disable this? It doesn&#39;t look pleasing to me.

The second question I have is that I recently got a Geforce 1070. Is there any way to further enhance the graphics beyond setting all settings options to max?

Thanks.</description>

            <p>i agree with text famguy on the fog.</p>
<p>If you want to further up the graphics, go to the launch options and put in +r_lod 0</p>
<p>This disables the source engines feature of rendering lower poly models at distance which means you will see hi quality models at any distance. Next, go to the main ‘Black Mesa’ folder, then go to bin. Find a file called dxsupport.cfg.</p>
<p>Open the file and for the first big cluster of lines up until it stops at vendor id and device id, look for any entry of the commands “cl_detaildist” and “cl_detailfade” under directx 90, 95, and 98, and change the default values from 1200 and 400 to 12000 and 4000. Save the changes and close the file. What those commands do is set the distance which any grass in outside levels cut off and fade in the distance. This should have a drastic change in the quality of the topside levels.</p>

            <p>The fog is a key part of the level’s aesthetic. The levels will look really strange and won’t blend well without them.</p>
<p>You can use fog_disable to disable fog, but it’s considered a cheat, so you have to enable cheats with sv_cheats 1.</p>
<p>There are no ways to further improve the looks of our game beyond maxing everything out.</p>
