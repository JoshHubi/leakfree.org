    <title>Value of my computer?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/value-of-my-computer/7479</link>
    <description>Hi, I got this Alienware a few months ago (it was a REALLY good price for the specifications, I couldn&#39;t build one nearly as good for the $900 I paid for it), and want to sell it while it still has some decent value and go the custom route. Thing is, I have no idea how much a configuration like this could go for right now.

Specs of my Alienware Aurora R2:
i7 860 2.8ghz liquid cooled
6gb DDR3 1333mhz
1tb 7200rpm hard drive
Radeon HD 5870

If it&#39;ll help, I could also bundle in my Acer H223H 23.6&quot; 1080p monitor.

Any idea how much I could get on eBay? Thanks!</description>

            <p>Obviously this changes since I´m in europe, but over here, that spec, i´d expect to pay 450-500€ which is if i´m not mistaken 640-710 USD, I, personally, wouldn´t pay more than that for those parts (including the screen).</p>
<p>The problem is mainly that, that i7 is the lower side of the i7 not to mention it´s no longer the current generation and the ram, while you havent mentioned model (could be valueram) is 1333 while gaming pc standards now are at least 1600mhz. I´m not familiar with radeons so can´t give my view on it but I´m assuming its decent having in mind the rest. Also, you didn´t mention anything about the motherboard. But yeah, all in all, more or less, the price I mentioned, which of course doesn´t mean you can´t try to sell it for more : )</p>

<p>Alienwares don’t have the kind of liquid cooling you’re thinking of. This is more like Corsair H50 liquid cooling, which works as well as many top air-cooled solutions but offers quieter operation, less space taken up and a lighter-weight cooling solution. Anyway, I didn’t configure this system myself, I don’t particularly like alienwares due to them being horribly overpriced. this one just happened to be marked down from $1600 to $900 when I bought it at Best Buy, and I got another $100 discount on top of that for it being a display model (at the time, I couldn’t build a system nearly as powerful for the price from parts bought on newegg).</p>
<p>i7 unlocked? This isn’t the latest generation of i7s, this is the i7 860, which means that it is significantly easier to overclock using traditional methods involving the bclock, unlike its Sandy Bridge counterparts. And I do have it overclocked ATM, I just listed the default clock speed in this thread so as not to advertise it as a higher-binned i7, which it isn’t.</p>

<p>Hmm… What is the current clock speed? How cool does it run after prolonged prime95 test?</p>

            <p>The fact that it’s alienware makes it worth less automatically, but as long as its still in good condition… i’d say 800-900 would be spot on, but i might be a bit outdated in the PC specs realm, i havent taken a look at anything in a long time.</p>
