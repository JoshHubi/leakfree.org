    <title>A Question About Steam Support</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-question-about-steam-support/2403</link>
    <description>Hi, i didnt have a game on steam, so i cant play this mod yet. So i decided to go to EB Games and get Half Life 2: Episode Pack. I tried activating it but it says the code has already been used:&#39;(. I&#39;ve never really been fond with steam and tried to avoid it, so i neglected to do something about until i thought i&#39;d just do it anyway. Thats when i saw that they wanted a reciept within the last 90 days of purchase:fffuuu:. I had already wasted like 60 something days. So i quickly made a scan with all the requirements, on december 26th 2009. Thing is, i still havent heard anything from them. I have a couple of questions:
Does it matter if i use MS Paint to write my username on the QR Card? (my All-In-One printer isnt exactly new)
How long does it usually take for them to finish a CD-Key Reset Proccess?
And lastly: Do i have to &quot;write&quot; the ticket code on the QR Card?

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Relax dude. Steam is well worth it. I was wary at first, but it was unwarranted. I haven’t had too many problems with steam since I started using it. The few problems I had were easily resolved without too much heartbreak. The only complaint I have against steam is that they are a little slow on the response time to their support questions. But I am giving them some slack since its the holidays and they must be extremely busy with the sales going on.<br>
Steams benefits are worth any initial hassle. Benefits like accessing your games and managing your account from any computer with an internet connection. Never having to keep up with CD keys, Steam stores them for you. Regular sales on industry titles. Having access to development tools to create mods and support for mods. Being able to see what games your friends have and being able to click on their name and join them in game, in the server they are in. Never having to run to a store and preorder a title, just log onto steam the day its released, and a couple clicks later it’s already downloading the game to your hard drive.</p>
<p>Besides, Steam has sales that retail stores can’t touch. If I were to have purchased all the games that I have now at full retail price at the time the sale took place, I would have spent <span class="bbcode-b">over</span> $300. After the sales, I have spent <span class="bbcode-b">under</span> $100 with an overall savings of 70%. You can’t beat that with a stick. On top of that, where else are you going to get Bioshock for $5, Prey for $2, Stalker for $2, the Orange box for $10, and Crysis Maximum edition for $13.59?! The answer is nowhere. Breathe deep a sigh of relief my friend, you have made no mistake.</p>

<p>Nah, i just dislike Steam, and i’d rather just get non-steam versions, even if some cost more money. I was thinking about buying a random source game on steam just for the sake of this mod, but i ran into Half Life: Episode Pack at EB Games while i was looking for a good WoW sale. Waste of $30 dollars if this crap doesnt end up working out. Then i wont even bother steam ever again. Theyre too paranoid. Im not worried that i didnt provide enough info, just how long theyre taking to respond since i only got until 24 Jan 10.</p>

<p>I remember there is a famous quote in internet like “Steam suck, whoever …” then i forgot.</p>

            <p>word to the wise; never buy a game for steam used<br>
(trust me, I had to re-purchase my copy of HL1 anthology from half-price books due to the fact that the opened, cheaper, copy of the game I had purchased had already been registered)</p>

            <p>Such a way with words.  I have yet to master such eloquence and I am a middle aged mommy.</p>
<p>Lil, your best bet really is gonna be with the steam support folks.  They may not answer in a timely manner, you may even be disgruntled by the responce, but in the end THEY are the master of all steam accounts.   :s hrug:</p>

<p>Steam support takes 3-5 business days for hijackings, so I would assume the lower priority stuff like this would take a bit longer.  I wouldnt worry tho mate.  You provided proof that the game is yours right? Then that is all you need to do.</p>
<p>And I dont know why you are so afraid of steam.  It is a delivery platform for games and their updates.  Why be afraid?</p>

            <p>Yeah, that sort of thing seems to happen…stupid pirates and their keygens.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You waited 60 days after you purchased the game before trying to install it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MS Paint thing shouldn’t really matter, as long as you didn’t block out and pertinent information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, idk how long a key request takes, as I avoid that whole process (by just buying on Steam). I gotta ask though: why don’t you like the Steam service? I know some people are just careful with credit/debit card transactions, etc. and even others are just madly and obsessively convinced that Steam is a demon sent from the bowels of the internet to mess up their computer…or something.</p>
<p>So if you’re ok with me asking, why not just buy on Steam? It avoids all this crap, you can re-download the game as many times as you like/need, I’m pretty sure the devs get more money without a middle-man, and your Steam games get updated automatically. I don’t get people’s problem with the service.</p>
