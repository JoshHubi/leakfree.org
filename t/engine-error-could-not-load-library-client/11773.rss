    <title>Engine Error - Could not load library client</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/engine-error-could-not-load-library-client/11773</link>
    <description>Hello.
After lots of issues with hl2.exe not working, I finally got this game to work. I must say it is truly amazing, and I&#39;ve enjoyed it enourmously. What I like most with this &#39;mod&#39; is that Black Mesa now finally looks like a place to do research. All very credible. Nice work.

Now for the problem... About two days ago I wanted to play it through again, and when I Launched the game from Steam, I had to wait for it to update Black Mesa and the SDK. When it finished, I started the game and now I get this error:

Engine error
Could not load library client.

So....how do I fix this?</description>

            <p>Same thing here. I used to play the mod just fine, now I can’t. Seems to have started after a SDK update, but not 100% sure.</p>
