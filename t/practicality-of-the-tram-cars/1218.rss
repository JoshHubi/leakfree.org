    <title>practicality of the tram cars</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/practicality-of-the-tram-cars/1218</link>
    <description>I hesitate to post this here since I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;m convinced of my own argument. The other night I was in need of something to do, so I started to comb over the screenshots (for about the tenth time or so) looking to see mapping styles etc.

My only real concern, among a few trivial ones, was that after looking over the tram sequence...  Simply put: I wouldn&#39;t trust it to carry cargo, let alone people. I don&#39;t mean to criticize the artistic quality of the levels, because they are amazing. However, I have noticed that the BMS team has gone to great lengths to correct &quot;things that don&#39;t make sense&quot;, architecturally. They have added vents where none where before because it makes sense. Structural supports where there were none before, window views into inaccessible labs where there had only been wasted flat walls before.

Considering all that, why wasn&#39;t more work taken to make the tram more practical? Maybe I&#39;m crazy but I would just assume that any corner that the thing took while following a bottom-rail (rather than top-rail that it sometimes uses) would find gravity and momentum spilling the thing over any time it went any faster than 5 mph / 8 kph...  That said, what propels it? From what I can tell the tram carriage is entirely lacking any engine/motor/crank/whatever. I thought perhaps the track itself had an internal hook/chain/something but that wouldn&#39;t really be very practical. 

So I&#39;m not suggesting anything here, because as far as I know, maybe the current screenshots don&#39;t show these things. I could also be underestimating the structural stength of a tiny rail keeping a 1 ton carriage in alignment as it moves around corners. Maybe the corners have dual-rails that I&#39;m not seeing.

Of course, I&#39;m splitting hairs here, but I wouldn&#39;t have noticed something so small unless the rest of the new Black Mesa wasn&#39;t so otherwise well thought and air-tight. I certainly wouldn&#39;t expect a mod by lesser developers to be concerned with such nit-picky details.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Back on the topic of the practicality of the Black Mesa trams, I have created a cross-section on how I think they’d work.  (Special thanks to Mr. Carlos Montero for the scientist pic which I found from…somewhere…can’t remember where.)</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f4086c3679e9de8eeb89059690e5127459ca9b40.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="yOOxZSdPo31FQoMZGuQTxD3Wtva" width="160" height="120"></p>
<p>Please note that I’m not a drawing-type artist and I threw this together super-quick so I apologize for the crudeness of this picture, but it should help explain how I’ve always thought it works.  When the track is underneath the tram (as it is in this picture), the tram “grabs” onto the track via magnetic levitation with a cuff that slides over the track on all four sides (save a cut-out for the track’s supports).  Same for the tracks above (which is absent in this picture).</p>
<p>As for balance when the track is below the tram?  Gyroscopes as others have said.  And possibly pre-cursors to the ZPEFM?  :meh:</p>
<p>It’s also possible that there are sensors inside the maglev cuffs that detect when the tram is leaning too far to one side and amplifies the attractor and repulsion magnets to compensate and push and pull the tram back to level.</p>

<p>Yes, but we’re talking about a 10-year old video game with a low-poly count and blurry textures. If they were just spots, why would they be there, and why in that distinct position? How do headcrabs find their prey?<br>
Of course, Valve retconned it in HL2, so it’s not really a big deal anymore.</p>

            <p>The eyes are beside the front legs on the inside.<br>
Ambient.Impact’s HD headcrab model makes them much more evident, but they are there on the texture.<br>
EDIT: I just checked the zombie model, the eyes are red and a bit stretched on the texture for the crab, instead of round, black and beady, but they are there too, if you look closely. Between the legs and the guy’s mouth.</p>

<p>Exactly. How real is head humping crabs with no eyes that somehow rip you open with mortal wounds but keep you alive, and laser shooting many eyed beings real in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, Headcrabs have six eyes, they’re between the two small claw/legs on the front of 'em. Look at the texture andyou’ll see it better.(Hope the eyes show up in BM cuz not many know about the eyes…)</p>

<p>You must be blind then. It’s about suspension of disbelief. You do it all the time when you watch television, see films, watch a play. Whatever you’re watching might not <span class="bbcode-i">be</span> real, but you suspend your disbelief so that you can enjoy it without always going ‘this is proposterous, I refuse to carry on watching this.’</p>
<p>People are concerned about realism when it comes to the world in which the story is centred. In Half-Life’s case, this world is the one which we inhabit, and so people are entitled to want realism for real objects such as guns, or real physics. Welcome to the forums though.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that not ALL games are bent on realism. We’ve all enjoyed games that, at some point, we saw something that made us go “Wow that’s not real”. The point is, the devs are doing their best to complete this mod to our liking. Don’t go making them change something when they’re nearly completed.</p>
