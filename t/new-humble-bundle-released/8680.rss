Humble Bundle number...I don&#39;t even know what series this is anymore...is out.  Haven&#39;t tried the new games yet, but I know Machinarium is worth the $5+ alone.  Looks like they&#39;re weeding out the cheapskates too.  $5 and up for Steam keys.  Still, it&#39;s entirely worth it.</description>
