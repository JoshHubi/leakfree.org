    <title>Help me finish my first-ever sound mod (Sound.cache problem?)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-me-finish-my-first-ever-sound-mod-sound-cache-problem/62800</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m not a total newbie; I&#39;ve been doing some form of game development since 1998, but I&#39;ve never done tons of Source modding before so I don&#39;t understand the finer details.

I&#39;ve gotten as far as generating a VPK for my sound mod. That local VPK works in Black Mesa just fine, but when I feed it through the Publishing Tool and try to subscribe to my own mod, suddenly it stops working and the console gets flooded with error messages like

&gt; Cannot figure out which search path sound\npc\alien_slave\vort_bm_alert01.wav came from.  Absolute path is D:\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\362890\1969844684\Classic Alien Slave Voice.vpk\sound\npc\alien_slave\vort_bm_alert01.wav
Failed to load sound

Searching these forums suggests I might need to build a soundcache to include with my VPK. Black Mesa seems to automatically generate a soundcache for my VPK after loading it the first time, so I point the Publishing Tool at the folder with the VPK + sound.cache file, but, again, the console is flooded with search path errors when it comes back down off the workshop.

[Another thread from two years ago](https://forums.blackmesasource.com/t/custom-audio-not-playing-in-workshop-ugc/15329) mentions a console command called &quot;snd_buildcache&quot;. So, instead of using the sound.cache file generated for my VPK, I copy all of my sound files in the proper folder structure in to bms and build a cache. 

This leaves me with

&gt; bms\aslave\sound.cache (664kb)

Which was built from

&gt; bms\aslave\sound\npc\alien_slave\ (62 files, 11.7mb)

I repack my VPK, publish it, and yet again, it&#39;s the same story: the local VPK I generated works fine for me, but trying to pull it off the workshop doesn&#39;t work because it&#39;s yelling about search path errors.

What am I missing? 

For reference, here&#39;s my VPK: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RGveUu4_udRaPQTaqYW5wAf6Txk0JSSn</description>

            <p>So after digging around in other people’s (functional) sound mods, I saw that none of them contained soundcaches or manifest lists or anything like that</p>
<p>Prefacing this, in my original attempt, I tried snd_restart to get my workshop submission to work and for some reason it did not.</p>
<p>Which is to say… this time it worked? This is just the same sound bug that effects everyone and for some reason I got buried in a weird version where snd_restart didn’t take at first. Maybe it built a bad cache originally? I honestly don’t know.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s fine now. Or as fine as it can be.</p>
