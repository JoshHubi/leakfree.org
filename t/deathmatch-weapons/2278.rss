    <title>Deathmatch Weapons</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/deathmatch-weapons/2278</link>
    <description>I&#39;d just like to suggest a bit for the deathmatch mode of Black mesa source. ( of course i&#39;m also looking forward for the SP :-P)
I&#39;ve heared it isn&#39;t carved in stone so far how the weapons will behave in BMS-Deathmatch.
So when the Player movement speed and the jump behavior is close to the way it is in HLDM i think it would really be best to keep the weapons mostly like they are in hldm (from damage and everything).
Of course it makes sense to weaken the gluon gun, and the Gauss Gun should probably not have such huge splashdamage effects when aiming for some edges or lamps, but the rest is actually working very good.
I spoke with rather many players about that</description>

<p>I never much liked HL2: DM to begin with. I think the maps were what annoyed me the most because there wasn’t really any secluded respawn area, it was in an open space where there could be any number of enemies nearby. And I always hate how people can pick up stronger and stronger weapons because if you die, and have to use a shitty pistol while a guy is spamming rockets, you’re fucked unless you’re like a master at the game. But that ones more personal preference.</p>

</aside>
<p>Become a “master” by yourself or play with friends who have the same skills like you… or play team-deathmatch. Problem solved. HL1DM was a perfectly thoughtout and balanced game and it shouldn’t get dumbed down by making each weapon equally powerful or giving players unfair spawn-protection.</p>

<p>yea… same… optional bhop (without speed-cap and depending on server-settings) should really be featured in bm:dm because it became a serious core-gameplay element over the years… especially for the competitive scene.</p>

<p>This in my opinion is what a good multiplayer game is like. Why? Because it requires skill and takes awhile to get good at. It challenges players and gives them the freedom to personalize their style. Games nowadays allow for the most unmotivated players to get easy frags.

<p>In conjunction with xtobix’s posts, I used to be an avid hl2dm player until the orange box update. It introduced many glitches and thwarted all the fun elements of the game such as effective speed skating, thus killing the community. But by doing so we stop playing that game and buy their newer products. Popular games nowadays are all about the money not the community, but many seem oblivious to that fact.</p>

<p>Yeah, half-life’s multiplayer is the most chaotic and random piece of trash ever.<br>
It was my first fps and I loved it, but good god, it’s way too god damn fast.<br>
Too hard to aim.<br>
Speed that makes you crash.<br>
Not able to enjoy details.<br>
And too easy for assholes to bhop there way to the speed of light and spawn kill like a mother.</p>
<p>The ps2 multiplayer for Half-life was better imo – much slower with better graphics and platforms that, if you ran too fast, would fall off of everytime. This made it a wise choice to walk and utilize lazor mines and satchels.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Yellow’]MY MAIN PROBLEM WITH HL MULTIPLAYER:</p>
<p>No one utilizes any weapons but the cheap ones.<br>
My favorite all time Multiplayer game is the old 007, because you could only run kinda slow and you had hop over and duck under the player’s traps and be sneaky and stealthy. You could try different tactics and snipe on a quiet battlefield with tension – good fucking luck sniping in HLDM btw; They had to make the darts of the sniper explosive just to make it a useful weapon, lol.<br>
By the by, not everyone is a pro sniper, so don’t give me your ego stories.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Magenta’]Point is, there is no stealth or tactics in Half-life deathmatch; you run around like a psycho swinging and firing until things die. And it gets boring really, really fast.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thsi is exactly right, about the cheap weapon use. How about a max amount amount of weapons you can carry:</p>
<p>1 heavy weapon aloud but you can’t have a medium weapons or special weapons then, so heavy weapons are like RPG, Tau cannon, and Glou gun</p>
<p>1 Medium weapon are Hivehand, shotgun, and mp4/5</p>
<p>1 special weapon pack which are snarks, grenades, and tripmines</p>
<p>1 small weapons are 357. and glock</p>
<p>and that is about it.</p>
<p>Ex:  a player can have an mp 5/4 with 1/2 grenades from the gun, a glock, and 3 tripmines.<br>
an player can also have an tau cannon, 357., and snarks</p>
<p>this is the closest I have come to thinking of a way to keep players from having all the strong weapons, I know it sucks  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Lol man. You don’t seem to have any clue about hl1dm gameplay.<br>
Crossbow is a very powerful weapon. When you zoom you shoot instant-hit shots which make 120 damage.<br>
It’s highly strategic and difficult gameplay to control the map and farm freshly spawned opponents… and honestly… HL is a action-shooter game… not a stealth game…<br>
…btw. … You can use most of the PS2 models in HL1… so let’s not talk about graphics here. It’s Black Mesa’s job to make HL pretty again.</p>

<p>Well, I like that simple way of hunting each other, you have to practice your skills to be good, there are no killstreaks or something like that.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Stop trolling the hardcore guy, he’s got some decent points.

<p>Counter Strike Source also gleans a huge amount of the online market due to it’s finely tuned gameplay, combining great level design, a high lethality among all players, and a balanced weapon set.

<p>HL is a fkn unfair game… but maybe that’s the reason why it’s the most balanced game i know.<br>
good players pwn - bad players get pwnd (by good players)<br>

<p>I love how you state that game devs want their games to suck solely because you can’t do unrealistic retarded crap like jumping to move faster &amp; that a game has to be fast to be fun. It really helps cement my feelings towards you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What I mean is… Modern multiplayer games only provide gameplay for casual gamers… It’s not that gameplay quality what it was like back in the HL1 days… Modern devs make games for money… Games that get boring after a while. They want this, because of the following problem:<br>
If they made a PERFECT game, everybody would love and play that game forever… People wouldn’t pay much attention to new games --&gt; people would buy less games --&gt; devs would earn less money. So simple. Games have to get boring after a while, if you (as a dev) want to be able to make money with future releases… and I think that this is why VALVe did not make CS:S, DOD:S and HL2DM as good as they were able to do it. They wanted to keep fans waiting for newer, even better games.</p>
<p>HL1 was better for competitions than most of the modern games today. You had no problems finding good servers, you could always play in the team you want… and you were able to vote maps, modes etc. (in AG).<br>
Nowerdays most games are cheap console ports and have really bad available options. Examples are Call of Duty: MW2 or Crysis 2 Demo here. You have to wait unnecessarily long in a gamelobby, until the next match starts. In Crysis 2 Demo you can’t even chose your team you want to play in. In some modern games you can’t even set exact values for your mousespeed, because you only have a slider without values.<br>
In HL you can just open your browser, pick a server and play. When you want to make a Clanwar you start AG, vote agstart and the match is live… You can also activate password on your HL server. If you want to have mousespeed 4.0 you go to options and set mousespeed to 4.0. It’s all uncomplicated.</p>
<p>It also provided nearly perfect weapon balance (I say nearly, because of the overpoweredness of the gluongun, which is a noob-gun… I mean the gluongun damage was fine in HLDM… But it would need reloading or a cooldown after the gun was shooting some time…).<br>
Gauss was overpowered, too… but it brought some more depth and structure into the whole gameplay, because players who have good aim and clever gameplay can make more kills by aggressive playstyle, spawnkilling and shooting opponents through walls (The gauss is the only weapon in HL, which can shoot through walls and give huge amounts of splash-damage to other players or NPCs)…<br>
Players with bad playstyle and bad aim lose.<br>
The key to win a 1vs1 game in HL is, to get the gauss… and kill the opponent, as long as you have the advantage… Your opponent will have the disadvantage, but he will still be able to get back the advantage, because every weapon can kill in HLDM, it just depends on the grade of skill and cleverness of the player using it. When you are disadvantaged in 1vs1 you must think, sometimes camp with satchel or bow, ambush your enemy… use the walk-key to sneak around… or try to escape your advantaged enemy fast movement/jumps… some maps are even build to provide bhop movement (stalkyard, crossfire, boot_camp, stalkx, gasworks and maybe more…). It’s actually not easy running and shooting like in todays noob-games where everybody spawns with equally good weapons and equally good movement.<br>
HLDM gameplay is weapon-based gameplay, since it does not have any powerups (quad damage, megahealth or powerful armors). If you want to get armor or some more healthpoints, move and go get some. They are distributed all over the map… If you want frags, go get a powerful weapon and aim. So you see… HL is not about timing weapons. It’s about reacting to your enemies playstyle and controlling the important spots of the map… That’s how HLDM works. It has real depth. No easy airstrike frags by overpowered bonuses like in CoD or other bs games. Just skill. Same for TDM.<br>
So… I hope BMDM will have HL1 movement, weapons, speed and balance…<br>
And no, you don’t need super realistic physics, realistic falldamage, random screenshaking while zooming, sprint or ironsights. No. These things don’t fit the HLDM gamestyle. HL is science-fiction and far from beeing realistic… So please try to accept it and consider the idea of competitive gameplay.It will bring a better long-time motivation to your mod… for sure…<br>
Just remember Starcraft2, which is modern… but highly competitive and popular.<br>
If you don’t like HL1 gamestyle… then why play BM? Go play a different game then. Nobody forces you people to play BMDM, maybe you just like the SP mode of HL1… Then you can play that (Fact is: HL1 Story Mode != HL1 Multiplayer).<br>
But for all hardcore HLDM fans who still actively play the game and love the gameplay mechanics, BMDM is the last chance to revive good “old” HLDM, bring it to the next era and make it attractive for new, younger players.<br>
I know many people from HLDM’s community… and many wish for a new, improved game, which is based on the original and has the same gamestyle… but all new games are only based on commerce and casual gaming --&gt; can’t replace HLDM.</p>
<p>Seriously. HL2 was nothing like HL1. The weapon arsenal of HL2 missed a LOT of HL1’s weapons. HL2 just didn’t use the huge potential it first had. I see, that it had a nice atmosphere, graphics, physics, character design and some new features like the gravitygun and vehicles… but it just lacked most of HL1’s items, weapons and features. In the end it’s a completely different game than HL1. It played rather like Halo, Doom3 or Fear… and not like HL1. So… Pls don’t forget the classic HL1 gamestyle. Your mod has huge potential. Just like HL2 had…</p>
<p>…Just my 2 cents.</p>

            <p>HL2DM was a lot of fun. Me and the clan I was in at the time wound up inventing a Source engine Pong variation with the Overwatch Pulse Rifle and the gravity gun. That + low gravity = fun times.</p>
