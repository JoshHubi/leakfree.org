    <title>The Cafeteria (Hazard Course)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-cafeteria-hazard-course/11403</link>
    <description>I posted a few in-game scripted sequence ideas in the Hazard Course thread that could take place in a cafeteria in between level segments in the Hazard Course (should they choose to include one) I&#39;m making this thread to try and keep their thread clear of clutter while they do important stuff.

Feel free to post your own in-game BM conversations/sequences, they can be anywhere in the game, as long as they fit with the BM universe, I guess they could count as fan fics, oh well.

[u]SCENARIO: After taking damage from something in the Hazard Course, Gordon walks into a cafeteria lounge, and sees Barney sitting at a table or leaning on a wall watching tv[/u]
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Woah, man-let me guess.. get into an argument with one of the female scientists again? here, it&#39;s on the house *holds out drink for player*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Havin&#39; a bad day champ? nothin&#39; a cold frosty Poke can&#39;t fix *holds out drink for player*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Now, just to be clear, this counts as the drink, okay? *holds out drink for player*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Freeman, catch! *lobs the can to the player, will automatically be consumed on contact*

[u]SCENARIO: A group of scientists (2 or 3) and security guards (1 or 2) sitting at a table playing a game of poker[/u]
*One of the scientists grabs a card*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Well?
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Well what?
[COLOR=&#39;Magenta&#39;]It&#39;s your move, Richard.
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]I know, I know.. [Under Breath] Ah crap..
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Uh, hey, didn&#39;t they just call your name over the PA?
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Quit stalling, you&#39;re simply delaying the inevitable.
*The player can walk around the table and see each player&#39;s cards*
*When the player stands behind Guard 1 and looks at his cards, he sees that he has the losing hand, this initiates the next script*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]ah, AH, AAAAAHHH CHOO!
*everyone drops their cards, they fly all around the table*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]My.. god!
[COLOR=&#39;Magenta&#39;]Cover your mouth, you&#39;re spreading germs everywhere!
[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;]Hoooly hell!
*The cards fall to the table and finally stop moving*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]..Heh, sorry about that fellas, I guess we&#39;re gonna have to start over.

[u]SCENARIO: Same poker scene, this time no scripted animation, if the player presses E on one of the scientists:[/u]
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Stay back Freeman, who knows what biohazards you could&#39;ve picked up in the Hazard Course with that suit of yours..
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]The only biohazard here is your fasion sense
*laughter*
*laughter*
*Scientist looks at the other players with a puzzled face*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]What&#39;s wrong with my polkadot tie?

[u]SCENARIO: A scientist is standing next to a security guard while he plays a Missile Command arcade machine[/u]
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]C’mon ya alien bastards!
*The machine yells out*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleGreen&#39;]GAME OVER
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Damn it!
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Mind if I have a turn?
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Huh, knock yourself out
*The scientist excels at the game, in less than 5 seconds he completes the first level*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleGreen&#39;]LEVEL ONE COMPLETE
*The Security guard lets out a sarcastic exhale and crosses his arms as he continues to watch the scientist advance to level 2*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]You see my friend, the key to victory is strategy
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Oh yeah?
*The security guard walks over to the side of the machine while the scientist is still playing*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Well here’s my strategy
*The Security Guard drop kicks the side of the arcade machine*
*The scientist jumps back surprised*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Oh dear!
[COLOR=&#39;PaleGreen&#39;]WARNING! WARNING! WArNRSHD- WAHRLH-WREEhjhablurrrrr...
*Coins begin to pour out of the machine like water*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Hohoo yeah, come to papa!
*The security guard scoops up a bunch of coins into his arms*
*The scientist looks around to see if anyone’s noticed*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]I do believe some pepperoni pizza is in order, come on buddy, my treat
*The security guard begins to walk over to the canteen with his heap of stolen coins*
*The scientist puts his hand on his forehead, sighs, and shakes his head in disapproval*
*the scientist then proceeds to follow the security guard*

[u]SCENARIO: Gordon walks up to a scientist and guard having a discreet conversation[/u]
*They’re talking about a female scientist, who is a few metres away at the canteen with her back turned to them, gathering various food onto her tray*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]But I don’t know what to say to her
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Ah come on, just say the first thing that comes to your mind
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]..Nothing’s coming to my mind!
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Alright alright, fine, I’ll tell you what to say
*the security guard whispers something into his ear*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Now go over there and hit a home run
*The scientist stands up, straightens his tie and takes in a deep breath, he then nervously walks over to the woman*
*the scientist stands next to her, she doesn’t seem to notice him, she continues to study the food*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Um, hello Annette
[COLOR=&#39;Magenta&#39;]Ah, Walter, what is it?
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]There&#39;s something I need to to tell you, my density, has popped me to you
[COLOR=&#39;Magenta&#39;]Um, excuse me doctor?
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Oh, I’m terribly sorry, what I meant to say is, my destiny, has brought me to you
[COLOR=&#39;Magenta&#39;]Wait a minute, isn’t that a line from Back to The Future?
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Uh, well-
[COLOR=&#39;Magenta&#39;]That’s one of my most favourite science fiction films of all time!
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Really?
*The scientist plays it cool*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]M-Mine too!
[COLOR=&#39;Magenta&#39;]Come, you must meet my colleagues
*The female scientist wraps her arm around his, leading him off to her group of friends*
*The scientist looks at the security guard and gives him a cheesy thumbs up*
*The security guard sarcastically gives a thumbs up back*
*The Security Guard says to himself*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]I don’t know how these kids ever survived without me

[u]SCENARIO: Gordon walks into an office and sees a scientist under his desk looking for something[/u]
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Now where did I put my glasses?
*The player can see that his glasses are on top of his desk, when he places them on the floor in front of the scientist, the next script is activated*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]There they are!
(Achievement completed)
*The scientist puts on his glasses, and then realises Gordon is standing there*
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]Oh hello Gordon Freeman, it&#39;s good to see you

[u]SCENARIO: Gordon sneaks up on two soldiers[/u]
[COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]Arrhh, where the hell are those guys? I&#39;m starving!
[COLOR=&#39;PaleGreen&#39;]Relax man, our shift&#39;s over in 10 minutes
[COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]aaaah I can&#39;t take it anymore!
*The soldier uses his weapon to smash open a candy machine*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleGreen&#39;]Haha, now that&#39;s using your noodle!
[COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]Just shut up and help me
*Both the soldiers kneel down to grab the food, they stay in this postition until Gordon attracts their attention or kills them*

[u][U]SCENARIO: Gordon hears a scientist and soldier in the next room[/u][/U]
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]There, I&#39;ve shown you to the weapons locker, now will you please let me go?
[COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]Hmm, I&#39;ll think about it..
*gunfire*

[u][U]SCENARIO: Gordon sees two scientists and a security guard crouching behind a cateen counter watching something in the kitchen[/u][/U]
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]What the hell is that thing? some sort of squid chicken?
[COLOR=&#39;Pink&#39;]I&#39;d say it&#39;s more of a &quot;bull squid&quot;
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]Well, whatever it is, it&#39;s going through our whole food supply, we gotta take it out
*Security Guard looks at the player*
[COLOR=&#39;PaleTurquoise&#39;]You with us, buddy?</description>

<p>True, that’s why I only said the first one. I could see these guys at post in the high security areas or just wondering around aimlessly during break. But I agree with you completely, of course I do.</p>

<p>Sounds like you’re slipping out of the Hazard Course, there. Regardless, these are definitely some hilarious scenes. Can’t wait to see what else you come up with.</p>

</aside>
<p>I wouldn’t say the first Marine scene is that far out of the bounds of realism, we see a military helicopter at the start of the game. Couldn’t we assume that Black Mesa has some form of an active garrison? I doubt they would send an Apache for a retinue check up. A couple of edits and I’d say the first could work.</p>

            <p>Victoria also has recorded the lines a long time ago, but we need to get them from Kevin, apparently. Other than that we’ll just ask them and see who’s interested. If no one is or they’re too busy or something we’ll figure <span class="bbcode-i">something</span> out.

<p>Other than the Gina hologram floating in front of you telling you to lead the Guard. Because Gina holograms floating around telling you to lead guards is obviously something to be found in a Cafeteria. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>There’s gotta be a better way to rationalize this.</p>

            <p>We had already mentioned (I think) the possibility of it being near where you exit the elevator. Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmmTKAKLSPM&amp;t=14m48s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. I feel it could work nicely, and introduce the usage of the drink machines, too.</p>

            <p>I personally really like the idea of a small break room, more than a cafeteria, with perhaps just a few tables, food, and such. Nothing huge.</p>
<p>I’ll try to think of something and post it tomorrow  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

It would be cool to start or come back to some sort of Cafeteria in the Hazard Course, I think it doesn’t fit too well in between.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I suck at creative writing, but when I come up with something in mind, I’ll let you know</p>
