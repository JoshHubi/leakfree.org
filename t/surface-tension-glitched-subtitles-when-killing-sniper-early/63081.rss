    <title>Surface Tension: glitched subtitles when killing sniper early</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/surface-tension-glitched-subtitles-when-killing-sniper-early/63081</link>
    <description>In Surface Tension, before the &quot;explosive building&quot;, there is an area with snipers outside. The first sniper is hinted at by the dying security guard with a scientist running to his aid. The sniper is hiding in a ventilation shaft.

If you do nothing, the sniper will shoot the scientist. However, if you kill the sniper very quickly (e.g. with the RPG), the scientist will run off screaming. The German language subtitles are glitched in this case: not only the actual subtitles are displayed, but also some kind of debug message. Also, there is a typo in the subtitles (&quot;Hife&quot; instead of &quot;Hilfe&quot;). Please see attached screenshot.
