    <title>Trouble getting HD pack to work on original HL</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/trouble-getting-hd-pack-to-work-on-original-hl/1189</link>
    <description>Okay, I just bought Half Life Anthology off of Steam and I&#39;m trying to install the HD pack that came out with Blue Shift.  

I did some digging around and found this
[url]https://www.jan-ripper.de/articles/steam_hd/[/url]
(These instructions were also found on the steam forums, so I know they are legit.)

I get the confirmation message that you can see on the lower right telling me it&#39;s been activated, but when I go to play Half Life, no dice.  (If I click it again, it tells me it&#39;s already active.)

I tried removing it (and getting a successful removal message) and putting it back.  But it still isn&#39;t working.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>It is linked in the Steam games list under Blue Shift. When you right click Blue Shift and click View Forums, it is the first thread, " Blue Shift Question/Answer Thread (updated 08/30/2005)." Sorry for the fail link :retard:</p>

            <p>well that;s hard to respond , it usually is about one’s capacity to put himself in other one’s shoes , don’t ask generic things that are about stuff by non-official people for official people with tight standards , ask complicated general stuff that happen all the time , like " why my windows broke when i deleted the folder “windows”" ? , logical stuff , your problem is more self-related and the chances of any of us trying to use or even know much about a HD model system for hl1 is roughly zero</p>
<p>try installing them [ after rereading the first post] anywhere and put them in the half-life/hl/models/ section</p>

<p>I did make an account there but<br>
“it may be awaiting activation.”</p>
<p>And I saw that people were asking for help on running other games, but it’s not okay to ask about the game this site is dedicated to (rebuilding)?</p>
<p>So, can you tell me what else isn’t okay to ask for help about?  Because I didn’t find the list you are using.  A working link to said list would be great.</p>
