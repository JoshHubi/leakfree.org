    <title>4chan attacks Youtube, somebody broke rule #1 of fight club</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/4chan-attacks-youtube-somebody-broke-rule-1-of-fight-club/2493</link>
    <description>Video-sharing website YouTube has removed hundreds of pornographic videos which were uploaded in what is believed to be a planned attack. 
One user believed to have uploaded some of the pornographic material videos is Flonty, whose profile states that he is 21 and from Germany.

He told the BBC: &quot;I did it because YouTube keeps deleting music. It was part of a 4Chan raid.&quot;

4Chan is a bulletin board focusing on Japanese manga and anime but some of its more extreme sections have been described on online messageboards as &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;horrifying stuff&quot;.

<p>No shit, that doesn’t change the fact that 4channers are stupid.</p>
<p>Like I said before the only good board is /hr/ for epic images but most of the time it’s flooded with porn and BS.</p>
<p>/mu/ is ok but everyone is a pretentious prick<br>
/v/ is the same as mu<br>
/g/ is decent<br>
/ic/ got me back in to drawing but the people their are pretentious pricks<br>
/x/ USED to be good for creepy shit and some conspiracy theories but then it became /b/'s toilet and all the fucking stupid btards ruined /x/</p>
