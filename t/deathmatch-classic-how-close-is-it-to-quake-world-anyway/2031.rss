    <title>deathmatch classic, how close IS it to quake world anyway?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/deathmatch-classic-how-close-is-it-to-quake-world-anyway/2031</link>
    <description>Hello, was thinking of getting deathmatch classic, but im not going to until this question is answered. Quake world (the game deathmatch classic was based from) was really satanic, even when you were playing mods you could see the pentagram in the corner. So i want to ask, Does deathmatch classic have satanism like quake world? if not, where can i get maps and such for the game?</description>

<p>Hello, was thinking of getting deathmatch classic, but im not going to until this question is answered. Quake world (the game deathmatch classic was based from) was really satanic, even when you were playing mods you could see the pentagram in the corner. So i want to ask, Does deathmatch classic have satanism like quake world? if not, where can i get maps and such for the game?</p>

            <p>Does the satanism bother you that much? Shouldn’t the simulated mindless killing of other people bother you more than a few pixels in the shape of a pentagram?</p>
<p>Sorry I can’t answer your actual question, though.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Hello, was thinking of getting deathmatch classic, but im not going to until this question is answered. Quake world (the game deathmatch classic was based from) was really satanic, even when you were playing mods you could see the pentagram in the corner. So i want to ask, Does deathmatch classic have satanism like quake world? if not, where can i get maps and such for the game?</p>
