    <description>Does anybody know anything about building speakers? Is there any point in doing it if I&#39;m considering buying a prebuilt cabinet? I&#39;m not completely ignorant to the world of audio electronics, but I&#39;ve never built a sound system before. Help = much appreciated :retard:</description>

            <p>If you just want speakers that go loud there’s nothing to it… but if you want them to sound nice you might want to look up some extra information about acoustics and stuff. there should be a lot of information on how to shape and size the case for your speakers depending on power and even where in the room you’re going to put them or the shape of the room.</p>
<p>this might also be useful: <a href="https://www.bcae1.com/spboxnew2.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.bcae1.com/spboxnew2.htm</a></p>
