    <title>The &quot;Barney&quot; Calhoun thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-barney-calhoun-thread/13287</link>
    <description>So, to pull a somewhat tangential topic off the &quot;Half-Life 3 is in development&quot; thread, I&#39;ve decided to make a new topic to get some conversation going.

The general assumption is the guard you see at the beginning of Half-Life banging on the door (and later play in Blue Shift) is &quot;Barney Calhoun&quot; (though he&#39;s only referenced as &quot;Calhoun&quot; in Blue Shift) and is the same character you later see in Half-Life 2 as &quot;Barney from Black Mesa&quot;.

Does anyone know if this is an official connection?  Is the character from &quot;Inbound&quot; and Blue Shift the Barney that Gordon meets up with in Half-Life 2?  I know it&#39;s the general assumption but has there ever been any official word that these two are the same character?</description>

<p>[…] It was a deliberate decision to have Gearbox never call him Barney in Blue Shift, only Calhoun. Raising the bar is not a game, so material is presented differently there; manifestations differ in every medium. Gearbox took our Barney and did their own best version, but I’m not sure that Barney is the same Barney I’m picturing when I picture Valve’s Barney. In the time BS was created, there were many Barneys. Only gradually have the redundant creature and character types slowly settled into iconic individuals…it’s an ongoing process. Gearbox did what was right for their games. […]</p>

<p>[…] The Barney in HL2 and the episodes is indeed Barney Calhoun. I few a bunch of us had just watched Ravenous. Colqhoun is the character Robert Carlyle played. I grabbed the name but went with a more familiar spelling. Names come from odd places. The question of Barney’s identity is fuzzier in HL and Blue Shift because that represented a shift-over from the generic clone army of “Barneys”…somehow he became individuated in there. I try not to think about it too hard. He didn’t have a last name in HL, and didn’t need one until later. […]</p>

            <p>Was the naming of Calhoun from Wreck-it Ralph in any way related to Barney? It seems like more than a coincidence, considering she’s an FPS character who fights alien-like creatures. And stuff.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure, as Barney escapes with a set of scientists that you don’t see in HL2. Also, there’s no further details on where he went or what he did.</p>
<p>It’s possible that HL2 Barney is different from HL Barney, but I believe I read somewhere that Barney was the class name for the security guard and that Calhoun was later decided to become a viable character in HL2. This was probably due to the fact that HL wasn’t planned to continue at first.</p>
<p>Dotard is right though, no one ever calls him Calhoun I believe. I don’t think there’s any evidence of his last name present at all. However, I think it’s assumed to be Calhoun, much like we assume Gordon has a helmet and a voice.</p>

            <p>Unless a future game retcons it, then he is, yes. Although it should be noted that he isn’t referred to as Calhoun in HL2 and episodes.</p>

            <p>Well, I have no problem with the character from Blue Shift being the character Gordon sees in “Inbound”.  The problem arises in the transition from the HL1 timeframe to the HL2 timeframe.  Is <a href="https://images.wikia.com/half-life/en/images/archive/9/97/20090714145242!Barney_meetup.jpg" data-bbcode="true">this character</a> the same as <a href="https://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100225192212/half-life/en/images/c/c1/Barney_first.jpg" data-bbcode="true">this character</a>?</p>

            <p>Well assuming Blue Shift is canon, then that IS Barney in the beginning of HL. There’s a discrepancy with Barney not having his gear until after entering the door, while he has it on already in HL when you see him, but that’s all. The rest matches up. When Barney claims that he thought Freeman died, that’s due to him witnessing the soldiers dragging Gordon off to the trash compactor.</p>
<p>I’ve never heard Gabe or anyone say it’s official though.</p>
