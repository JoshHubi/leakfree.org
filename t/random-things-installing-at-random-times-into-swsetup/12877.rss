    <title>Random things installing at random times into SWsetup</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/random-things-installing-at-random-times-into-swsetup/12877</link>
    <description>Recently, I&#39;ve been doing...whatever, and occasionally I&#39;ll see an icon appear in my taskbar. When I click on it, it shows a progress bar with &quot;extracting so and so to such and such&quot;. If I&#39;m fast enough and get task manager to show me what it&#39;s doing, it takes me to the folder &quot;SWsetup&quot;. I always close the thing before it finishes loading, but I can&#39;t help but be worried what it is. It even happened [i]as I was typing this very topic.[/i] What&#39;s going on? Do I have some sort of virus?</description>

<p>That would be my guess as well. As CPU said it’s an HP folder, it’s the default location for driver package extractions. If it’s happening automatically, it’s probably an automatic update service that’s doing it, or else maybe you tried to install some driver and it failed and is now trying to do it again. If you go into the SWsetup folder and look at which subfolders have what creation/modification date, you might be able to track down which package it’s trying to install (the subfolder name is the same name as a driver package from HP).</p>

            <p>Can you offer more information? What do you mean by “get task manager to show you what it’s doing”? were you doing around the time this started? What is SWsetup?</p>
