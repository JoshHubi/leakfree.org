    <title>Screen Goes Randomly Black</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/screen-goes-randomly-black/10432</link>
    <description>When I&#39;m playing the game and I get to a certain spot in the game the screen goes black all of a sudden. I can still hear the game sounds and I can see my HUD but I can&#39;t see anything else. If I load a previous save it goes back to normal but when I proceed through the game the screen goes black again. Why does this happen?</description>

            <p>Thanks for reporting it. Could you please provide the hardware and software details of your PC, they are essential for troubleshooting this problem.</p>
<p>It looks like a problem related to misbehaving post-processing shader on some older GPUs. Could you please try proposed workarounds available here:<br>

            <p>Idk I think i found how to fix this, you need to pick up an object and carry it with you, if you drop it the screen goes black again. I’m not sure, it worked for me though - when i got to the other zone the screen went back to normal</p>

            <p>I get this too.<br>
in the level blast pit when you get to the green toxic goo, my screen goes black after passing a certain point (if flashlight is on blue screen). I can see my HUD and when I shoot with something it turns slightly red like when you’re hurt and you can see again but only for a slight time, a really slight time. I actually got further by using that but finally ran out of ammo. The screen doesn’t return to normal even if you advance to the next huge toxic pit.<br>
Any idea how to fix this?</p>
