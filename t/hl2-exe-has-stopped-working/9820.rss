    <title>hl2.exe has stopped working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-exe-has-stopped-working/9820</link>
    <description>I&#39;m flabbergasted. I have been eagerly waiting for Black Mesa, downloaded it as soon as it appeared, installed ... only to get the dreadful 

hl2.exe has stopped working

I&#39;ve checked that the source is in the right place (used the installer, though), I&#39;ve updated video drivers, I&#39;ve even removed all local HL2* to force re-loading of any necessary content (nothing happened, though), but nothing works. Working on a plain, fully patched W7 32 Pro, NVidia 560 Ti, old Core 2 1.8 overclocked to 2.7, 2Gb Ram, at 1366x768.

Please help. The MDMP is attached.

Thanks

            <p>Ocasionally the game crashes for me, but it’s ok. The funny thing is that if I Tab down the game and do something else, than even hours later I can re-enter it. Just try this with HL2, the game crashes in no time.</p>
