    <title>hl2.exe has stopped working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-exe-has-stopped-working/11243</link>
    <description>I have Win7-64, Core i5 2500k @3.6ghz, 16gb ram, Geforce GTS 450, 1920x1280, nvidia driver version 306.23.

It has been years since I have run a valve game, but they ran fine. I do not currently have any other valve game / sdk installed, so I am unable to tell if these still work. I don&#39;t feel like downloading a multi gigabyte game just to see if it runs.

I first installed SDK 2007 first. for some reason this caused the SDK 2006 to download too. These are the ONLY sdk&#39;s installed.

I then downloaded BM and ran its installer. It installed into the correct folder (re: [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=13956&#39;]this post[/url]).

Inside steam, I pressed the &#39;Play&#39; button and it began to launch, but showed a &quot;hl2.exe has stopped working, please close the program&#39; error.

As per [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12513&#39;]this post[/url], I checked for a minidump but found that NO dump files are created. So hl2.exe isn&#39;t actually launching far enough to create its dump file.

As per [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14063&#39;]this thread[/url] i have tried the following start up options.


* -safe
* -window
* -window -dxlevel 90
* -window -dxlevel91
* -dxlevel90
* -fullscreen -width 1920 -height 1280
* -window -width 800 -height 600
* -safe -window


none of these options work.

I have checked these locations for steam dump files but found nothing at all (e.g. no files have been created or modified on todays date).

* c:\program files(x86)\steam\dumps
* C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS
* C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\frumbert\source sdk base 2007


obviously it&#39;s working for other people, why not me?</description>

<p>Um, no. I installed it using the installer, as I noted. I also noted the FAQ’s and reference posts that I have already been through, which themselves tell me to use the correct installation path (which I have, since the installer did it), and to try all the settings I listed and to verify that the sdk is installed properly and so on. Everything, as far as I can tell, says “this should work”. I have a standard Win7 X64 English non unicode operating system.</p>
