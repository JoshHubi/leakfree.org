    <description>I wish there would exist a BM Fan Store, but I know there will never be one, because for different reasons.

But it would at least being cool, if you could create at least the media in virtual form, so that everyone could print it out by himself.
I could imagine for example a few cool posters or overprints for T-Shirts and mugs.

Would be great to have a category on the media page, where you also could add links to different Internet print services.

What do you think?</description>

            <p>A quick Google search gave me some stuff with the black mesa logo on it… I always thought a BM coffee mug would be cool.</p>
<p>Any way here’s the <a href="https://www.zazzle.com/black+mesa+gifts" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">link</a>.</p>

<p>But not with the Black Mesa (Source) writing/logo.<br>

            <p>Yeah, Posters are likely the main ones anybody would buy. The Valve store already has  bunch of T-shirts and Black Mesa mugs though.</p>
