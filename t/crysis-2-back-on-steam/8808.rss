    <description>[url=&#39;https://attackofthefanboy.com/news/crysis-2-returns-steam/&#39;]So any thoughts on this?[/url] I for one am quite happy about it even through it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean Mass Effect 3 will be released on Steam once it&#39;s DLC development is exhausted.

<p>Also, Crysis 1 and Warhead are phenomenal. Open-ended freeform combat, tons of emergent gameplay…I will never understand why people say they’re just generic, pretty shooters. They aren’t. You’ll like them.</p>
<p>Crysis 2 is a great linear shooter. Not linear like COD or something, more in the vein of Halo, with sever large, open set pieces. Most of the awesome sim elements are gone as well, but it’s still a really good game. Just know what you’re getting into.</p>

<p>Yeah, I do expect I will. I buy from a ton of different genres and best way I’ve figured out if I will like a game or not is when I ask myself; “do you like what this game is trying to be? Does it reach what it’s grasping for?”<br>
If the answer to either of those is no then I don’t buy it.</p>
<p>I’m really glad that the CryEngine and it’s games have come to where they are. The Unreal Engine can’t sit by nearly as comfortably as it could 8 years ago. It’s especially heartening what with how depressing it is to see Sweeny licking Nvidia’s boots and denegrating the PC in favour of consoles that belong to the middle of the last decade, while at the same time endorsing Nvidia who is predominantly known for producing PC graphics cards?<br>
Lol wut?<br>
I can haz contradiction? :S</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT:</span></span></span></p>
<p>Oh yeah, thanks for sharing that CryEngine3 demo Ryλn, it was awesome!</p>

            <p>Yeah, I remember that. It was like static objects you could place and save in multiplayer, but no physics. Playing with the Editor was more fun.</p>

            <p>What this tells me is that once EA figures they have sold as much as they are going to sell on Origin they’ll put it on steam. Which as a competitive thing for steam is kinda crap because the reason steam as a platform does so well is that its great for support long AFTER the initial year of sales.</p>

<p>Mass Effect 3’s online is embedded in Origin so even if you could get it on Steam you’d still have to run Origin. Same with BF3.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’ll probably just keep the standard edition. None of the DLC looks too interesting.</p>
<p>Also, Crysis 1 and Warhead are phenomenal. Open-ended freeform combat, tons of emergent gameplay…I will never understand why people say they’re just generic, pretty shooters. They aren’t. You’ll like them.</p>

            <p>Well it’s not the same edition as the one that you bought though.<br>
It’s been re-released on Steam because the value of all the DLC packages has been integrated into the price.<br>
Seeing as you already own the base game you can upgrade to the maximum edition for half price till 12 June for $20.</p>
<p>I’m mostly excited about this because I’m about to buy a new PC and I haven’t played any of the Crysis games.</p>

            <p>Doesn’t really affect me, since I got the game on Steam originally, and you could still download it. But I do think Crysis 2 is a really underrated game that more people should play. It just isn’t a very good Crysis game, so it gets shat on a lot.</p>
