            <p>Half-Life 2 is also minus the tilting.</p>
<p>Some Source games have an “sv_rollangle” command (I <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> it might be natively exclusive to MP builds), but by default it’s usually 0.</p>
<p>If memory serves, though, WON version of HL1 did have the tilting.</p>

            <p>GoldSrc had a wonderful glitch where music would play off the CD drive filling in for main game tracks, regardless of whether the disc in the drive was HL. So I wound up playing the cliffs area to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnjZXrOgvzg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Franz Ferdinand’s song 40’.</a></p>
<p>That was awesome.</p>

            <p>Yes, that has been done before.<br>
The Decay mod actually did that exact thing, only with a remixed version of the theme.</p>
