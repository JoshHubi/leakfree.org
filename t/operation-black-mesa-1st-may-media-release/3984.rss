<p>Monsters and weapons were only different in Blue Shift because of the HD pack.  If you played without it, the shared monsters and weapons used the same models.</p>

            <p>I actually had no idea that Guard Duty and OBM merged, so excuse my ignorance on that.</p>
<p>Though really, collaboration between Black Mesa and the other team really wouldn’t accomplish TOO much. Apart from weapons, the only things that are shared are parts of the tram ride at the beginnings of HL and Blue Shift, the dam, and the portal chamber, are the only ones I can remember. That would still require a ton of content being made by each team anyway.</p>

            <p>Congrats on merging with Gaurd Duty! I understand that BM and you guys had your own reasons for not working together, but I always saw it as frustrating that both you and BM were putting all this work and effort into these projects and doing everything twice when collaboration would require making it only once. It also lowered the overall quality of the mods because, as “fucker88” mentioned, this is all meant to be the exact same BMRF, and the mods would be better if identical locations/monsters/weapons etc. were actually identical. Well anyway, I’m glad GD and OPB won’t be in that situation, and it should lower your workload while also increasing the quality of both mods. I’ve seen a lot of great work from you guys, keep it up!</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can’t agree when you say the work will be out of date.<br>
With that kind of perspective you might as well consider all official Valve games and community Source mods out of date before they are even started when you realize other far superior engines already existed upon release of Episode 2, L4D1 and 2, and even Portal 2, such as CryEngine, FrostBite, Unreal, etc etc.<br>
Plus these mods aren’t official games, so we don’t have licensed versions of the already outdated Source Engine. No matter how much detail we put into a model, there is always gonna be a engine limit which will keep us “outdated” as you would say.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what will most likely happen. If we truly desired the most advanced graphical capabilities, we would never have started using Source for these remakes lol.</p>

<p>I won’t disagree. There are definitely some models we have that are of poor quality. They are all undergoing changes and improvements, which has definitely been stepped up since the merge of GD and OBM.<br>

</aside>
<p>I’m not sure I understand what you are saying. It’s probably the language barrier… but I think you are saying you want all the areas that are shared between all 3 games to be the same?<br>
In this case, GD and OBM will share all the same areas, because we are 1 team. We will not, however, have the same areas that BM does - such as the tram platform where Barney is for example.<br>
They will look similar, but will definitely not be the same exact area copy and pasted, because GD and OBM don’t work with BM.</p>
