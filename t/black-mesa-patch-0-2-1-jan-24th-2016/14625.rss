    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-patch-0-2-1-jan-24th-2016/14625</link>
    <description>We&#39;ve released a patch to Black Mesa main client

* Fixed a bug in the balanced spawn system
* Fixed Shotgun Collision model
* Fixed various spelling errors and missing .wav files in dialouges.
* Fixed the Crossbows lighting origin
* RPG rocket won&#39;t clip with the rocket when reloading.
* Dr. Kleiners head and hands are now properly smooth (smoooooth as jazz)
* Fixed blood not splattering on the MP5
* Fixed the where placing 11 satchels crashed the MP server
* Crossfire Optimization increased - will run much smoother now.
* Added muzzle flash dynamic light checkbox to options menu.
* Added godrays enable checkbox to the options menu
* Minor optimizations made to netcode.
* Fixed &#39;FIX IT DENIZ&#39; skin on monitor in UC.
* Fixed game_round_win Entity to actually win rounds.
* Polished the workshop tool. (like, it works now, and you can upload thumbnails)
[list][*]All workshop content and addons will now be found/located in the SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890 folder
[/*:m][/list:u][b]This update may corrupt and break save files. If you&#39;re experience any issues with old loads, please restart the game at the start of that chapter.  You can do that by clicking &quot;New Game&quot; on the main menu, and picking the latest chapter you were on. [/b]

Additionally, if you are experiencing issues with missing models or textures in-game, you have a legacy error with mods. If you have subscribed to any mods since launch and are experiencing these issues please do the following steps to fix the issue.
1. Unsubscribe from all Black Mesa mods
1. Go to ***\SteamApps\workshop\content\362890 (where *** is the location to where your steam games may be)
1. Delete all folders within this folder
1. Launch Black Mesa, and you should be good to go.
Once you do this, you should be able to re-subscribe to any and all mods that you want.

Not sure which mods to download? Why not try [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=608116737&#39;]On a Rail Uncut - now officially released on the Steam Workshop.[/url]

EDIT:
It is known that the Workshop Addon&#39;s button doesn&#39;t work in the Main Menu (whoops!)</description>

            <p>I just recently bought and downloaded this game, but a lot of entries are missing from the skill.cfg! Are they now hard-coded into the game, preventing changes to damage?</p>

            <p>Yay! Most addons work now. (most). Gamechangers still dont work, like weaker marines/hl1 ammo values. And yes, i know, you have to drag some manually to the folder, but im too lazy to do that. I’ll just wait until it’s all fixed.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>How can i oper the Developer Console with another character from my Italian Keyboard??</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is possible to change the console key to something else in the game’s options:<a href="https://localhost/mybb/attachment.php?aid=3463" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://localhost/mybb/attachment.php?thumbnail=3463" alt=""></a><br>
From the main menu, click “Options”, then “Keyboard”. Scroll down the list and locate “Toggle developer console” under “Miscellaneous”. Click it and then click the “Edit key” button. Now press the key you would like to use for the console.</p>
<p>Note that the developer console key doesn’t work when you are in the menu screen (at least it doesn’t for me), only when you are in-game.</p>
<p>Also, it might be worth noting that the Inbound Tram Vox voice and the overhead announcements have not been translated in the Italian translation (nor in the Norwegian translation). So you will see English closed captions during the entire tram ride until you meet the guard at the lobby entrance.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok perfect!Now , after restarting all, the subtitles in Italian work.!!!<br>
But I do not understand a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First of all, when I check the Italian language, because even the menus and written phrases are written in English?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, if I select closed captions, duties have subtitles in Italian for everything, even for the Inbound “Tram  Vox voice and the overhead announcements”; Instead I find myself to have only subtitles for dialogues, as if “Subtitles (dialog only) had selected”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>this is a normal thing?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, all that is unforunately normal. We made the mistake of assuming that the localization will happen when you change your steam settings, we were incorrect. So, right now only the subtitles and not the closed captions, or menu are being localized properly.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then it will be fixed in the future??</p>
<p>I mean, it will be settled in the Italian language in all menus and subtitles?</p>

<p>Moreover, if I select closed captions, duties have subtitles in Italian for everything, even for the Inbound “Tram  Vox voice and the overhead announcements”; Instead i have only subtitles for dialogues, as if “Subtitles<br>
(dialog only)” had selected.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. I’m all good as long as I know that it’s a known bug and you guys will do something about it once after fixing other major bugs.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great update. This game is just getting better and better.</p>
<p>I don’t really know if it is a problem or if i’m just doing something wrong:<br>
So I updated BM and subscribed for OAR Uncut in the workshop. I checked the folders, the data was there. I started a new game from the beginning of On A Rail (I did not load a saved game) and played until I reached the point where TEXT’s maps should blend into the game, but they didn’t. The chapter was unchanged from the retail version.<br>
I only tried it once until now, but I just wanted to make sure I’m doing erverything right, since the workshop button in the menu is broken and all.<br>
Do I have to type something into the console or move around the data in the folders? I couldn’t find such instructions. It is bascially just subsrcibing or unsubcribing to the workshop addons, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Ok, thanks in advance for the help!</p>

<p>You should only need to click subscribe. Check your Downloads section (on steam, not black mesa) and see if you downloaded any workshop content recently.</p>

<p>From the main menu, click “Options”, then “Keyboard”. Scroll down the list and locate “Toggle developer console” under “Miscellaneous”. Click it and then click the “Edit key” button. Now press the key you would like to use for the console.</p>
<p>Note that the developer console key doesn’t work when you are in the menu screen (at least it doesn’t for me), only when you are in-game.</p>
<p>Also, it might be worth noting that the Inbound Tram Vox voice and the overhead announcements have not been translated in the Italian translation (nor in the Norwegian translation). So you will see English closed captions during the entire tram ride until you meet the guard at the lobby entrance.</p>

<p>I think this article have some useful information about that.</p>
<p>Or, in fact, this just occured to me. There is a file called autoexec.cfg which is executed every time a game loads. You can try putting cc_lang italian command into that file and see if that helps. Usually, however, cc_lang command is saved once you use it, nullifying need of doing this. But give it a try anyway. This way, you do not need to fiddle with the console as it will be auto-executed every time. The file is located in bms\cfg folder.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure what the italian console key is, I’m just not sure. I also don’t have any friends who are italian who could tell me.</p>
<p>Using the -console launch options is probably your best bet.</p>

<p>[sub]Both Italian and Spanish subtitles work perfectly fine on my game. Are you sure you are doing everything correctly? I noticed you are using capital letters, but that shouldn’t be a problem.[/sub][sub]Disclaimer: I’m not Italian. I also didn’t need to restart the Steam nor game. You can change the language in real time, in-game.[/sub]<br>
