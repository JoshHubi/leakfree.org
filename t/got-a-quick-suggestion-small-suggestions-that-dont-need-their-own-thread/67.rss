            <p>Oh god…<br>
They’re using the Mark IV, and as said a billion of times, no helmet. Especially with release right around the corner.</p>

            <p>Assuming that BM will have the mark 5 instead of mark 4. And that BM is a separate organism from valve.<br>
I am suggesting to add a protection helmet which can contain more info about the world around Freeman.</p>
<p>Now a alot will say halo much etc.<br>
But the helmet is made available only when Gordon suits up to go to XEn. For those who played hl1 you must have notice the hev with a helmet on the dead bodies that had already departed there.</p>
<p>-The helmet will bring some more hudy aspect on the sides of the screen.</p>
<p>-A little diagram that will show parts of the hev (legs, hand and so on) so when you get shot and that the hev is getting dmg at a specific part turns red. BUt will still offer protection Its just pictorial not very in the game or it can be just random. And turns back to yellow when recharge.</p>
<p>-And maybe some more info like the vital fluctuation (hospital monitoring thingy). Which change when he runs, attacking, under stress and fear.<br>
And of course being dead.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>-And yes the gravity indicator cause xen has different gravity.</p>
<p>-heV helmet would bring an additional 25 more protection point.</p>
<p>Now since Black Mesa is a recreation of hl1 we all know what will be happening in the game (atleast most of it).<br>
This little add on to the original suit will put forward a little bit of new in the game hence promoting gamers curiosity a bit more.</p>

            <p>why not. It has super technology that stops bullets, protects from explosions right next to the user, and has storage for a bunch of weapons in a space smaller than that taken up by all of the weapons, so it doesn’t seem too far fetched</p>

</aside>
<p>AFAIK it is in the process of forming up. A few new guys joined up in the translation forum.<br>
Let’s move this discussion to pm or the translation thread to let this one stay on topic.</p>

<p>Well, someone did do it in goldsrc. It probably is possible, but just stupidly unnecessary.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, but Goldsrc is an entirely different engine. Just because Goldsrc supports something doesn’t mean Source can. Although in the end just like you said it’s stupidly unnecessary.</p>

<p>I know how the STS works, ffs. All I’m saying is, why should community translators there be any better, than community translators elsewhere?</p>
<p>And JFYI, even if you try getting on STS it takes a while. My application is with them for bout a week now, and I’ve still heared zilch. So we’ve gone over to getting things done on our own and we’ve succeeded translating HL1’s script in two days and are awaiting the arrival of the BM script to compare and improve on it (that is translating new lines).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If I’m not mistaken by the country below your avatar, the Germans have 11 unrevised applications and even without that they are way behind with translating (at least 1500 untranslated strings). So yeah, some countries are pretty shit when it comes to string management.</p>
<p>Oh well, whatever. I tried my best. If the devs decided to add them onto STS I suppose Valve would skip the application system for the translators of the original version (like they wanted to do so for Dota veterans).</p>
<p>Do you know anything about a Polish translation group?</p>
