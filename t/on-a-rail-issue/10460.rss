    <title>On a Rail Issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/on-a-rail-issue/10460</link>
    <description>Not really a bug, more a level design issues.

Its in &quot;On a Rail&quot;, on the second elevator shaft that takes you up. I drove the tram onto the elevator and it started moving. I then got off an took the ladder. 

The elevator beat me to the top. Once I climbed the ladder all the way, the back of the Tram was blocking the doorway and I couldn&#39;t continue. Had to reload a save.

Just wanted to point that out.</description>
