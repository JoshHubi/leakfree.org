    <title>Do you ever had trouble with pests?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/do-you-ever-had-trouble-with-pests/5586</link>
    <description>Today...after I had my haircut...with intention to take a bath, I found this troublemaker in my tub,  how to get rid of him? I tried to push him back from where he came with shower pressure, the problem? It was to bigger to sneak through drain holes of the tub! Solution? I got him with a dustpan and I dropped in the WC
How do I solve this problem to not happen again?

<p>Well, from time to time things like that in forums need to be changed to inforce more valid things such as forum discussion which I happen to see a massive lack of in this area of the forum especially. I can’t exactly say why it must be done but you really need to learn how to exactly place the bricks in the bookshelf, if I might say. Over time, many things, besides unfair justice must be applied to the things that need them the most, rather than the other way around. I do, however, grant you my thanks as to atleast putting one brick, the brick of making a point, so very carefully in the bookshelf. It really shows how much you care, from what I’ve seen so far.</p>

<p>I’m with this man. I had a bad experience with centipedes. One night while playing X-box 360 around 3:00 AM, one of those motherfuckers was messing with my feet. I tried to kill it, but it was so fucking smart it demoralized me. I read that Raid bug killer has no affect, and that if you get bit you end up in the hospital. That damn battle ended with it climbing to the roof and comming in my direction till I left the basement. I have’nt seen it since, <em>shivers</em>. I hear those things can kill small dogs, so be carefull.</p>
