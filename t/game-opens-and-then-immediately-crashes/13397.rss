    <title>Game Opens and Then Immediately Crashes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-opens-and-then-immediately-crashes/13397</link>
    <description>I&#39;ll state this upfront: I do have the Source SDK [b]2007[/b] installed. I&#39;ve re-installed it twice. I&#39;ve re-installed  black mesa [i]three[/i] times. Each time I deleted the BMS folder before the next install. As I have a super slow connection speed, this whole process has taken 11 or 12 days. All three times I&#39;ve used the torrent to avoid wasting a day and a half only to have my connection drop out and then get a corrupted, incomplete download. If I seem like I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end, that&#39;s because I&#39;m getting close. 

However, I have been trying to stay patient, and I still am.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I&#39;ve tried changing the dx level to &quot;-dxlevel 80,&quot; &quot;-dxlevel 81,&quot; &quot;-dxlevel 90,&quot; &quot;-dxlevel 95,&quot; and &quot;-dxlevel 98.&quot; I&#39;ve tried using the &#39;-window(ed?),&quot; &quot;-fs&quot; and &quot;-fullscreen&quot; launch options. 

I originally had BMS working perfectly. Since around the time In  first installed Black Mesa, I&#39;ve had SweetFX installed. A few months back I installed On a Rail Uncut and Surface Tension Uncut, problem free. Around 13 (or was it 12?) days ago I tried to install [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-uplink&#39;]Black Mesa: Uplink[/url] And then Black Mesa wouldn&#39;t start. I thought &quot;Fine, I could use a fresh install.&quot; I deleted all of the SweetFX dlls (Well, the ones I could find, which was all but two), deleted the BMS folder, and downloaded Black Mesa. Finished downloading it, installed it, Opened steam, and then attempted to play Black Mesa without any mods. 

The game opened and then closed immediately. No error message, not even the &quot;Valve Model.&quot; Nothing but a black screen for a few seconds and the immediate close. Changing the direct x mode didn&#39;t help, so I googled my problem. I tried changing the launch options to &quot;-windowed.&quot; While that did give me a window, it did not fix the problem. I tried &quot;-autoconfig,&quot; but that didn&#39;t help, either. After every launch option change, I restarted steam and then attempted to play.

I would upload an .mdmp file for you guys, but I don&#39;t see one. Any help would be appreciated, as I&#39;ve exhausted practically every option to no avail.

<p>Does anything happen if you try this link steam://run/218 ?</p>

<p>Sorry for the super late reply. I fixed the issue. For some reason the deletion of one of the Swett FX files didn’t take. I should have checked twice.</p>
<p>Sorry for wasting your time.</p>

<p>I added -condebug to the launch options, ‘launched’ the game, then went to “C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS” and nothing was generated.</p>
