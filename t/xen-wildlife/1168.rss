    <title>Xen Wildlife</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xen-wildlife/1168</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen numerous suggestions about Xen Wildlife in several threads, but never an actual topic.

So I though &quot;Eh, why not.&quot;

My main point here is that behavior on Xen should be slightly different then behavior in Black Mesa. This isn&#39;t really a small suggection, so I figured it warrants its own thread.

Monsters in on Xen in HL1 seemed placed their to fight you, much too like it was in BM. This could be remedied by seeing them wandering around beforehand. Also, to make Xen seem more alive, wildlife could be seen wandering around in unacessible areas. For example, packs of Houndeyes on a distant island.

There should also be more Xen wildlife on Xen. Xen seemed oddly berift of Houndeyes, Bullsquids, and Barnacles.

I&#39;m not sure if these suggestions will really get much attention, but it&#39;s certainly worth making a topic about.</description>

            <p>I always looked at Xen as some kind of cluster of floating rocks with a lot of fungi and such on them.</p>
<p>Xen is not supposed to be inhabited with anything naturally.</p>
<p>I always was giving the impression that it was the refuge for alien races running from the Combine – so a mix of species makes sense.</p>
<p>That’s is why the grunts appear to be some kind of makeshift militia for the sector.</p>

<p>The creators put the time and effort into making poop-chutes for the Manta models, so the question of what the Manta’s eat is just as valid as the question that was asked of why the original Manta models lacked realistic features such as areas for biological waste disposal (poop chutes).</p>

<p>I think you’re <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> missing the point of playtesting, and I’m glad none of you are playing Black Mesa yet.</p>

<p>Pretty sure the point is to find bugs and tell the devs your opinion on what can be improved and such.</p>

            <p>Portal’s playtesters got it right. Just the right combination of ‘WTF’ and ‘oohhhh’.</p>

<p>One of the trailers (I think Trailer 3), took place during the final battle.</p>
<p>And honestly, it was just one huge clusterfuck made of epic and win. Rebels fighting Combine Soldiers everywhere. Gunships strafing the player as they pass overhead (but not specifically targeting you), Combine Soldiers with RPG’s firing at Rebel Outposts. And all the while you had to go take out the Striders.</p>
<p>It seemed the like best battle ever, then I got the game. It sucked. Striders and Hunters, nothing else. Where’s my epic finale valve? Well turns out the playtesters thought there was too much going on and thought some parts were too hard. As a result it was severely dumbed down to the point where it became “Throw this thing at that thing and shoot it”.</p>

</aside>
<p>Valve is bad at only one thing:pickin’out playtesters.I guess they look into some random phone book and just go choose some random people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If that were true, then we would have seen wild coyotes or Raminator driving a monster truck in any of the outdoor BM media pictures. Therefore, keeping the same trends with the Xen levels would actually maintain the same level of detail of the Black Mesa chapters anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Everything in the media is a work in progress, and doesn’t necessarily represent the final result. My point was geared more towards the level of detail in the levels themselves rather than wildlife (although vultures may well make an appearance). BM’s eye for detail is far more than Valve’s in HL2 and even Episode 2.</p>
