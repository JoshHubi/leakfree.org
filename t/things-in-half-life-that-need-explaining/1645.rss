    <title>Things in Half-Life That Need Explaining</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/things-in-half-life-that-need-explaining/1645</link>
    <description>Like my old &quot;What would you change about Half-Life 2&quot; topic, I want to know what some of the things are in Half-Life (as a series) that could use some in-game clarification. Examples:

* How and where did the Gravity Gun come from, why was it made?
* How did Mossman and Eli manage to escape the Citadel?
* Why does becoming a zombie cause one&#39;s torso to rip open?

Anything, big or small, and even the Gearbox expansions if you feel like it.
I really don&#39;t want this to turn is to a debate about Gordon&#39;s imaginary helmet, absurd theories or constant reference to the leak/alpha/beta/concept art as if it actually still matters, but I know that&#39;s going to happen anyway.</description>

<p>I said “as a series.” I didn’t use any Half-Life 1 examples because I couldn’t think of any. And with ratio of people actually asking questions compared to the number of people making up stupid answers, i’d say it’s time for a lock.</p>

<p>Also, from what I understand, the headcrabs came to our world from xen.  But why dont I see any headcrabs on xen?  I assume xen was not actually their homeworld right? So it was a border world from their normal world.  Therefore</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If I recall, all the headcrabs stopped spawning once you killed the Gonarch. Also, the Nihilanth’s “Done, what have you done?” seems to imply that by killing the Gonarch and the Headcrabs, we’ve destroyed Xen’s eco system.</p>

[*]Why does becoming a zombie cause one’s torso to rip open?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The Gravity Gun was developed by Eli and Kleiner in the 20 year span between Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2, <span class="bbcode-b">it was built for handling hazardous materials</span>.</p>
<p>There is a combine teleport somewhere inside the citadel which is how Mossman and Eli arrived there in the first place, Mossman set the co-ordinates of the Nova Prospekt teleport to teleport them to the Citadel’s teleport instead of Kleiner’s. Mossman and Eli escaped the citadel this way too. Which is precisely why Eli is already back with Kleiner at the beginning of Episode 1.</p>
<p>It’s not confirmed, but most people agree that the mutated chest-cavity is used for feeding and possibly breathing, since the headcrab is obstructing the mouth and nose. Though, aparently they can still vocalise moans… which would imply that their airways are still intact.</p>

<p>How did everyone find the time to get to White Forest between HL2 and Ep1?</p>
<p>How did Mossman get there and to the Arctic base…BETWEEN HL2 AND EP1!?</p>
<p>Why was Mossman’s message stored on the Citadel mainframe?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>After Mossman and Eli were teleported out of the citadel to Kleiners lab they probably teleported to white forest if there is a teleporter there. If not then they obviously took a train to white forest. We don’t know how much time passed between the explosion at the top of the citadel and when Gordon emerges from the rubble at ground zero. Probably a few hours.</p>
<p>Mossman had already left for the Arctic base at the start of Episode 1, after arriving at White Forest. She may have used a teleport or other form of transport such as helicopter.</p>
<p>Mossman’s message was intercepted by the combine somehow, possibly by another insider within the rebels and that’s why it was recieved by the citadel and not sent to Kleiner. Obviously the combine are equally interested by the Borealis. Alyx found it whilst downloading the combine transmission data.</p>

What is the purpose of the headcrabs desire to turn humans into zombies?  So that they have better access (limbs) to eat food?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s unknown what headcrabs normal diet consists of, but headcrabs are omnivorous as evidenced by Llamar who lives off a diet of watermelons. It’s unclear how headcrabs cause the mutations that they do. Headcrabs appear to be quite primitive and their behaviour seems purely instinctive. They do what they do to feed.</p>

<p>It’s not known if headcrabs were originally from Xen, but they certainly inhabited it. We don’t see the entirety of Xen, I have the feeling that Xen is much larger that what we see and that it’s stretched over a large interdimensional plane.</p>

It obviously shoots lasers (Which, not so obviously, are made of Tau particles) and not projectiles.</p>

<p>They need it to eat.<br>
If you look closely you can see teeth.<br>
And iff you watch some zombies in the original Half-Life kneeling over a dead corpse, you can see how they grab flesh parts and put it into their stomach. The headcrab has no way to assimilate food, so the mutation made a new body opening.</p>

<p>The rocket was trasporting a satellite into space and this satellite was supposed to reinforce a signal which was sent by the Lambda team to close the dimensional rift. The only problem was, that the power of the Nihilanth kept it open.</p>

What is the purpose of the headcrabs desire to turn humans into zombies?  So that they have better access (limbs) to eat food?</p>
