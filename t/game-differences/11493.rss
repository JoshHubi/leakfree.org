    <description>What are the actual gameplay-based differences in this mod? I&#39;m not talking about the layout of the maps or anything, but what exactly was changed?

I&#39;m wondering because you can easily edit a lot of things through the scripts ad was thinking about maybe making a sort of mod that makes it somewhat more similar to the original Half Life. I&#39;d like to say this is out of fun, in my opinion Black Mesa is better than Half Life.

So, these are what I know so far

[b][u]Differences[/u][/b]
Tentacle in the Mine Field in Surface Tension is missing
Reduced reserve Magnum ammo
-40% clip size MP5 (Includes Grenades)
Increased Marine Accuracy
Magnum in Office Complex, and not Blast Pit
Shotgun in We&#39;ve Got Hostiles and not Office Complex
Chopper Destruction is mandatory
Tentacles are no longer idle
No Teleportation to Xen
Crowbar distributed later
Visible mines
Questionable Ethics Ambush
Vortigaunts &amp; Houndeyes in the Lambda Core Portal Area
Garg is immune to everything except scripted events
HECU Medics 
No Leeches</description>

            <p>Probably when the guard said that Barney is scarce around these parts, probably he meant only on Sector C. There are a lot of sectors in BMRF.</p>

<p>As said right there in the article,<span class="bbcode-i"> “his identity and location is not officially canonized at any point in the game, allowing his presence to be almost entirely up to the interpretation of the player”.</span> So, his official presence in the mod is still questionable and open to debate, specially if you consider the AM’s guard quote that I pointed in my previous post. That wiki article could be improved in many ways after some thoughts… Anyway, I suggest to bring this discussion to the wiki’s talk page, as defining Barney’s appearance is not the point of this thread.</p>

            <p>In HL, you get the shotgun in Office Complex, when you save a hapless security guard from his zombified friend, and you get the Magnum in Blast Pit after you kill the tentacles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in BM, you get the Magnum in OC, when you would have gotten the shotgun, and then get the shotgun later in We’ve Got Hostiles from the HECU.</p>

            <p>What are the actual gameplay-based differences in this mod? I’m not talking about the layout of the maps or anything, but what exactly was changed?</p>
<p>I’m wondering because you can easily edit a lot of things through the scripts ad was thinking about maybe making a sort of mod that makes it somewhat more similar to the original Half Life. I’d like to say this is out of fun, in my opinion Black Mesa is better than Half Life.</p>
<p>So, these are what I know so far</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Differences</span></span><br>
Tentacle in the Mine Field in Surface Tension is missing<br>
Reduced reserve Magnum ammo<br>
-40% clip size MP5 (Includes Grenades)<br>
Increased Marine Accuracy<br>
Magnum in Office Complex, and not Blast Pit<br>
Shotgun in We’ve Got Hostiles and not Office Complex<br>
Chopper Destruction is mandatory<br>
Tentacles are no longer idle<br>
No Teleportation to Xen<br>
Crowbar distributed later<br>
Visible mines<br>
Questionable Ethics Ambush<br>
Vortigaunts &amp; Houndeyes in the Lambda Core Portal Area<br>
Garg is immune to everything except scripted events<br>
HECU Medics<br>
No Leeches</p>
