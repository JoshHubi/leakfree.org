    <title>Crash in Elevator</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-in-elevator/15333</link>
    <description>Attached is the DMP file for the crash. Happens repeatedly on the map. The elevator can be located at:
map: bm_c1a2c at x = -976, y = -279, z=1831
Using the Beta Open Client. The last log messages are:

Bad SetLocalAngles(0.000000,0.000000,360004.500000) on c1a2a_rotating_fan1
CModelLoader::Map_IsValid: &#39;maps/bm_c1a3a.bsp&#39; is not a valid BSP file
CNewPostProcess::LevelShutdownPreEntity
CNewRenderer::LevelShutdownPreEntity
CNewPostProcess::LevelShutdownPostEntity
NewPostProcess: ShutdownCustomRenderTargets Called
CNewRenderer::LevelShutdownPostEntity
NewRenderer: ShutdownCustomRenderTargets Called
Dropped Crafter0800 (Le Potato) from server (Server shutting down)

Further investigation appears to show that this issue only occurs after entering the elevator, and is time based. (standing perfectly still after entering the elevator will still cause a crash)

As I cannot upload the DMP file directly to the forums - I have uploaded it to google drive and linked it here:

            <p>Please post your system specs including the Operating System (CPU, RAM, Graphics Card (model number and total memory))<br>
Also post if you are playing the Regular release or did you Opt-In to the Public Beta.<br>
And list the mods you have, thanks.</p>
<p>Restart your computer and see if it still crashes.</p>
<p>If it still crashes uninstall all mods and verify the integrity of the game files.</p>
<p>Weird crashes can sometimes be fixed by setting all of the graphics settings to low and decreasing your resolution, then try the problem area again.</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable Cascade Shadow Maps (CSM) same for the Dynamic Lights</li>
<li>Decrease shadows to the lowest setting</li>
<li>Turn off God Rays</li>
<li>Lower or disable Anti-aliasing (AA)</li>
<li>Decrease your resolution</li>
<li>Under the Black Mesa tab turn off everthing DLight related and any video enhancements.</li>
<li>Decrease all settings under the video tab to the lowest setting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you tried restarting that unlocked chapter. Go to the New Game menu and pick that chapter, just in case your saved game is corrupt.</p>
<p>You can use “sv_unlockedchapters 15” in the console without quotes to unlock all the chapters and go to the New Game menu and pick a different chapter to see if it still locks up or to skip that area entirely.</p>

            <p>Apparently a DMP file is not a valid file upload type - if someone could inform me of how to upload the dump file (or otherwise attain a crash report) then that would be much appreciated. Also the “crash” simply closes the server and sends me to the main menu.</p>
