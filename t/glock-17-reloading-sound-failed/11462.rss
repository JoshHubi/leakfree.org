    <title>Glock 17 reloading sound failed</title>

    <description>Hey,

I have found a bug of the Glock 17. Every time I reloaded it in a ventilation shaft, the sound did not appear (that klicking of the magazine and stuff).

I know it&#39;s only a little bug, but I wanted to report it.  :slight_smile:
