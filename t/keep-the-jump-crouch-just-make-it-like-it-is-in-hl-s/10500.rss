    <title>Keep the Jump-Crouch, just make it like it is in HL:S</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/keep-the-jump-crouch-just-make-it-like-it-is-in-hl-s/10500</link>
    <description>Being old enough to have played HL1 on CD in college when it came out I&#39;ve been looking forward to Black Mesa Source for some time now. (5 years? maybe 6, idk.) Thank you Black Mesa Modification Team for all your time and effort.

My only concern so far (like many others) is the Jump-Crouch, except i don&#39;t want it removed or nerfed or macro&#39;d- just fixed.

After about 5 hours of play (yes i explore a lot to see the changes) i started to become frustrated that even the simplest of jumps seem to require Jump-Crouch, like jumping over the laser tripmines. Sure I&#39;m getting old(er) and my reflexes aren&#39;t what they used to be but none the less the player character just feels awkwardly heavy when it comes to jumping. (Sort of how the player character in the Hitman games feels poky when running around.)

So I installed Half-Life and Half-Life:Source and did some testing and sure enough jumping in HL1 and HL1:S was different enough to be noticeable. I tested with the laser tripmine in the beginning of c1a3. Jumping takes the player character noticeably higher in the air to where laser tripmines did not require a Jump-Crouch but getting onto the larger waist/chest-high crate nearby did.

I read over in another thread an individual stating to adjust the values of [i]bms_normal_jump_vertical_speed[/i] and [i]bms_normal_jump_crouch_vertical_speed[/i] from [i]160 [/i]to [i]200 [/i]in [i]skill.cfg[/i].

Being a Source engine game this got me searching for what the original values are in Half-Life:Source but unfortunately i was unable to find such information...

Was this change in jump height truly done on purpose or is this just an oversight?</description>

            <p>So the game sets jumping speed? That may explain it. If the developers were tweaking the vertical… well, jumping height is proroptional to velocity squared, i.e. decreasing velocity by 30% will drop the vertical reach of the jump twice.<br>
At the moment in BMS Gordon cannot climb objects 2 feet high without crouch jumping  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  And boxes are quite a bit bigger than that.</p>

            <p>They don’t all require jump crouch. In fact I got up to Chapter 7 without having to use it. It wasn’t until I came here to report some bugs that I even remembered that there was a better way to jump. Most jumps can be attained by simply ‘sprinting’ and then ‘jumping’</p>
<p>Though I agree that it should be macroed. It’s extremely annoying when you’re trying to ‘sprint’ and then ‘jump crouch’.</p>

            <p>i agree, and am in the process of installing a fix i know from TF2.</p>
<p>unfortunately this will mean that jump-crouch no longer exists for me, but i’m ok with that, the alternative being jump-crouching every damn jump.</p>
<p>the fix?<br>
put the following into …\Steam\steamapps\SourceMods\BMS\cfg\config.cfg, replacing the line “bind “SPACE” “+jump””</p>
<p><code>alias +crouchjump "+jump; +duck"
alias -crouchjump "-duck; -jump"
bind "SPACE" "+crouchjump"</code></p>

            <p>It can be realistic, but its really annoying for people who are used to jumping in HL1 and really dont like to die 100500 times on simple tripwires (which cant be jumped upon :MAD <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  or other things like processing platforms…</p>

<p>I have to agree, it seems like pretty much all jumps require jump-crouch. This feels a bit lame to me, seems like you could have just removed it then. Never really understood the reasoning behind it anyways. It just makes jump puzzles more annoying, I get jump-crouching to get into vents and stuff, but to get on top of a crate?</p>

</aside>
<p>I can’t see a pronlem with that… On the opposite, they tried to make even this more realistic and it’s logical. When you jump onto some high crate you must crouch.</p>
