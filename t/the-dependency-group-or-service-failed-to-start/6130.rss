    <title>&quot;The dependency group or service failed to start&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-dependency-group-or-service-failed-to-start/6130</link>
    <description>I get this error when I try to start a program with admin privileges.

&quot;The dependency group or service failed to start&quot;

I don&#39;t know what is causing the problem. I thought I fixed it but apparently I did not. You guys know whats up?

EDIT: Actually A WHOLE BUNCH OF SHIT HAPPENS.

- The error above

- Start menu does not respond to my clicks

- Cant watch Youtube videos, adobe plug in crashes on load.

- Windows Explorer periodically crashes.

This all happens after my PC has been up for a while. I cant run most of the fixes I find because they require admin privileges to run the programs required.

Also, this has nothing to do with my network. :\</description>

            <p>I have never heard of it before.  But that doesnt really mean anything to be honest.  I am only sorry I got nothin to offer.</p>
<p>Still, there are a lot of very bright whippersnappers here, so I am sure someone will have something for you.</p>
<p>If it were me, I would get my hands on an operating system disk and reformat.  =(</p>

<p>so what HAVE you done so far to attempt to remedy?  Have you done a spyware scan yet. Can you do anything in safemode?  Have you googled it? Any clue to where the problem may be?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I tried to replace a suspected dll “nlasvc.dll” with a non broken one, but apparently all I did was slightly-cripple my internet connection permanently. B)</p>
<p>I think it is something to do with the dependency services. But I cant access them because I get that Group error stated above. :’(</p>
<p>I can do stuff in safemode, I have run many virus scans, and I have googled it.<br>
Scans get rid of malware but not the malware causing the issue, and google brings up network problems.</p>
<p>AM I SERIOUSLY THE ONLY ONE HERE WITH THIS PROBLEM?</p>
