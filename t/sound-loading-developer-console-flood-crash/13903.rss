    <title>Sound loading, developer console flood, &amp; crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sound-loading-developer-console-flood-crash/13903</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have been noticing that sounds in Black Mesa seem to not load in time. For example, I could break open a box, fire a weapon, or have an enemy spawn in, and no sound would play until several seconds later, after which the game would fire off every sound that was missed. Afterward, the sounds would be fine.

The issue seems to happen the first time the sound is played after loading a new map, but it&#39;s inconsistent in which sounds don&#39;t play. Something with caches maybe? I have 8GB of RAM, and the game is installed on a 1TB hard drive with a very high RPM, so I don&#39;t think it could be a hardware issue.

In addition, I&#39;ve noticed that the developer console for the game gets FLOODED with something to do with the flashlight:

Cannot update control point 1 for effect &#39;flashlight_firstperson&#39;.

This is all behind the scenes, so it didn&#39;t interfere with gameplay, but I found it strange to have the console spitting out [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=439073626&#39;]line after line after line[/url] of this. I&#39;m wondering if it could have any performance impact. I have Dlights disabled, but toggling them on or off doesn&#39;t seem to stop the console from spewing the same error.

The final thing I&#39;d like to report is a crash I received when I was checking out the &quot;character customization&quot; function. I went to select one of the zombie player models, the game froze up and crashed soon after. I&#39;ve attached the dump for further review. (EDIT: The forums aren&#39;t letting me attach the dump file. Says the extension is invalid: crash_bms.exe_20150507205921_1.dmp)

Thanks in advance! Love what you all have done in the intervening years!

(I originally posted this in Steam&#39;s community forums, but there&#39;s been some heavy activity in there and I felt it more suitable to post on these forums instead.)</description>
