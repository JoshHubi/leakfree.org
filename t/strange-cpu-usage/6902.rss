    <title>Strange CPU Usage %</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/strange-cpu-usage/6902</link>
    <description>So recently my CPU has been locking up for mabye 30 sec or so, then its fine, when I check my processes I sometimes notice programs taking up abnormal percentages. Like winrar at 60% CPU usage, or iexplorer at 30, this didn&#39;t used to happen and I have almost no background programs running. Usually my idle system usage is at 95-99 than i get skips/hangsups when im playing bf2, on a side note, i have my pc case open with a fan blowing into it, it keeps my gpu at 40C idle so i like that, but its pointing right at my cpu fan, which blows out,could this effect my cpu, like create a vortex
 of doom or something? :smiley:  Any help would be much appreciated.

My specs:
AMD Athlon x2 5000+
3gb ram
nvidia 9600 gt</description>

<p>Firefox doesn’t appear different from the outside because like someone said already the code is different. Firefox has superior security in comparison with IE8. However Google Chrome is faster than all 3 with the security of Firefox and speed like no other. I would strongly recommend Chrome to anyone who is looking for a faster, leaner browser.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It depends what you’re looking for in a browser. Chrome is undeniably faster, but Firefox’s main feature is the customisation available for it. Tons of addons and themes can be gotten. I’m sure that Chrome probably has these as well, but Firefox’s popularity means that it has many more developers, and a lot of irreplacable addons.</p>
<p>That’s why Firefox is so popular, am I wrong?</p>

<p>…what is considered a high temp for a cpu?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Goto google and lookup your cpu model because every cpu can have different temps when idle/under stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Real Temp</a>, it’s a monitoring program that will immediately give you your temps in C or F.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are running hot, you’ll have to fix that, which can sometimes be a chore.</p>

            <p>i skimmed through the posts above, ie and winrar ARE NOT THE PROBLEM, they were just examples of disproportionate cpu usage, ie should NEVER take up 50%, same with explore.exe which also does this.</p>

<p>Sort of, games run fine and smooth, then out of no where they might lock up for a few secs, its not my gpu as it never gets hotter than 70-80C on max load, im more inclined to think its some sort of hardware problem:[<br>
i ran a full virus scan and nothing came up,<br>
also, IE vs FF who the fuck cares? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Anyway, as for your problem of CPU usage, it could be many things. You didn’t list what version of Windows you’re using… but you have a half-decent video card, an AMD x64 processor, 3GB RAM, are having issues with Internet Explorer and WinRAR, I’m going to pretend you’re using Windows Vista x64.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your CPU is staying cool. You said that your cpu fan “blows out”? Except for very fancy rigs, every cpu fan that I’ve seen blow toward the cpu/heatsink.</li>
<li>Scan your computer for malware/spyware/virus etc - I recommend <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/SecurityEssentials" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">MSE</a> or <a href="https://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html?part=dl-85737&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Avast</a>.</li>
<li>Check IE for plug-ins running and disable unnessary ones - THESE CAN TAKE A LOT OF RESOURCES!</li>
<li>Run Windows Update, make sure all of that is taken care of. Check device manager to make sure every device has a driver.</li>
<li>This could be a memory leak… you may want to buy all new RAM, and try to get more of it (Limit of 4GB on Vista x86).</li>
<li>Upgrade (Clean Install) to Windows 7 x64.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a few other things you can try, but those are the top things to try (including changing browser which is always the right thing to do - <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Link to Chrome</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>thanks for giving a good reply, I have windows 7 32bit, i actually run pretty much bare minimum of background programs(no more than 4 on startup) also i checked my cpu fan,aka stuck a piece of paper near it, and it does not blow out, my bad, also what is considered a high temp for a cpu?</p>

<p>As for your computer issues. It sounds to me like you’ve got a virus. Probably from using IE so much. As robot suggested. Go download an anti-virus program such as Avast, MSE, or if you don’t want Avast to eat all your resources try Avira which is also free.</p>
<p>Keep these running in the background even after you’ve found and destroyed the virus that’s slowing down your computer so that if another one ever tries to invade your system again, it will tell you and you won’t have to come back to the BMS forums and get flamed for using IE. If it’s not a virus then as another person said, i would suggest a fresh install of Windows. Windows 7, if you have the cash, has a anti-virus system pre-installed on it. I can’t personally vouch for it’s quality since the last AV microsoft tried to release was a pile of steaming shit but it’s still something regardless.</p>

<p>Well, technically you don’t “see” the difference with IE and Firefox because it’s not really the outside (UI) that’s the problem, it’s the inside (code)… IE8 fails as a web browser in general. Or is it IE9 that’s giving you the problems?</p>
<p>Anyway, as for your problem of CPU usage, it could be many things. You didn’t list what version of Windows you’re using… but you have a half-decent video card, an AMD x64 processor, 3GB RAM, are having issues with Internet Explorer and WinRAR, I’m going to pretend you’re using Windows Vista x64.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your CPU is staying cool. You said that your cpu fan “blows out”? Except for very fancy rigs, every cpu fan that I’ve seen blow toward the cpu/heatsink.</li>
<li>Scan your computer for malware/spyware/virus etc - I recommend <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/SecurityEssentials" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">MSE</a> or <a href="https://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html?part=dl-85737&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Avast</a>.</li>
<li>Check IE for plug-ins running and disable unnessary ones - THESE CAN TAKE A LOT OF RESOURCES!</li>
<li>Run Windows Update, make sure all of that is taken care of. Check device manager to make sure every device has a driver.</li>
<li>This could be a memory leak… you may want to buy all new RAM, and try to get more of it (Limit of 4GB on Vista x86).</li>
<li>Upgrade (Clean Install) to Windows 7 x64.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a few other things you can try, but those are the top things to try (including changing browser which is always the right thing to do - <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Link to Chrome</a>).</p>

</aside>
<p>Seeing as how IE came first and the overwhelming majority of the population still use it, I think that it would be more accurate to say that if there was no such thing as Firefox we would only have to write CSS once. Whenever I design a site, I optimize first for IE, then for everything else because 70% of the people visiting will be IE users.</p>

<p>Er, what? Are you implying CSS is read exactly the same by Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, etc?</p>
