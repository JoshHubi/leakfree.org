    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multiplayer-maps-you-would-like-to-see-ported-or-remade/2685</link>
    <description>What BMDM maps would you like to see ported or remade from HL2DM, HLDM and HLDM:Source or any FPS for that matter?

My current wish list:


* Lost Village
* Biohazard
* Torque
* Lockdown (not sure how it would play in BMDM though)
* Overwatch (should make good use of the TAU)

I have also done a port of q3dm6 aka “the campgrounds” from quake 3.<br>

<p>I don’t want to see any HL2 maps remade for BM. That would make no sense. Also, they’re all pretty bad.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, they really wouldn’t have to be remade. I’m pretty sure you can just copy the appropriate .bsp files into the maps folder, and I imagine it would work just fine. Seeing how this is all really just a mod, and the files all correlate anyways.</p>
<p>Heh, I did that to CS 1.6 maps, dropping them into the Wanted! “maps” folder and it actually worked. Albeit with altered sky boxes, but it was pretty sweet. HLDM maps worked too. But that was 1.6; Source might have changed that, however experimentation might actually reveal something grand.</p>
<p>I did try putting a CS: Source map into the CS:CZ “maps” folder, and oddly enough, it worked, albeit with degraded textures. It was actually kinda funny.</p>
