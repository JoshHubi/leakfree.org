    <title>Underground to Escape - Source game project</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/underground-to-escape-source-game-project/12722</link>
    <description>Hello  :slight_smile: 

I&#39;d like to present you the mod I am currently working on, with a bunch of friends. It&#39;s called [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/underground-to-escape&#39;][i]Underground to Escape[/i][/url].

Basically, it will be half puzzle-game, half shooter, with what we think will be quite a unique plot and storyline. The project was born about 2 years ago, but as the current version has absolutely nothing to do with the original one, let&#39;s say it&#39;s more like 1 year old. If I were to define it by analogy, it would be a mix between Half-Life, Portal, drugs and french house.

It takes place in an office and its undergrounds, which will be the setting for very strange events. That&#39;s all we are ready to tell right now.

If you want to know more, don&#39;t hesitate to visit our [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/underground-to-escape&#39;]ModDB page[/url], our [url=&#39;https://www.uteproject.net/&#39;]website[/url] and our [url=&#39;https://twitter.com/teambananagames&#39;]Twitter[/url].
And of course, here is the first teaser:

More stuff is coming, so stay tuned!
