            <p>Yes, though everything is restricted by a set of laws, called the constitution. Which is another thing they are violating.</p>

<p>If the government has more power than the people, then the government is no longer of the people, nor for it.</p>
<p>“The government” isn’t some separate entity (or shouldn’t be), it is (should be) an organizational structure. It shouldn’t treat its citizens (and everyone else) as suspects. It should <span class="bbcode-i">be</span> its citizens.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Snowden, we wouldn’t even know “what the government chooses to do.” And what it chooses to do, at the very least, does not justify the resources it consumes.</p>
<p>“Innocent until proven guilty” doesn’t mean anything to you?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with you up to a point. The government is a separate entity in a sense. It’s an entity that is created to serve the people, and therefore has only a few things it is designed and allowed to do. The rest are restricted by a set of laws.</p>
<p>I agree with what you are trying to say though. The government’s bounds should be fundamentally restricted, and it shouldn’t be up to a government worker to determine the state of our “fundamental rights.”</p>

            <p>Where there is data there will always be abuse. It comes down to what government and society do about that. Right now, it is the governments (not only the US) that encroach more and more on fundamental civil rights while in the other hand abuse is not addressed properly but rather tolerated or worse: those in power don’t know enough about technology and its capabilities to grasp what they are actually doing to society.</p>

            <p>Constitutional reboot is step one, rewriting all laws is step two, but you need a new constitution that forbids certain laws from being passed in the first place. Try to keep up here.</p>

<p>This only happens if there some system in place that can autonomously analyze all behaviors and look for perceived faults. The NSA system doesn’t do that; they pull data on specific people.</p>
<p>Law enforcement doesn’t work by investigating <span class="bbcode-i">everybody</span> on the off chance they’re doing something wrong. That’s inefficient and impractical.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, ‘rebooting’ the constitution is an incredibly stupid idea. TGP, have you even read it? There aren’t a whole lot of laws in there.</p>

<p>That is an excellent question, to which I don’t have an answer. I know a few of the things that I would want said in there, and the general philosophies I would want followed, but I understand that I would have no say, and do not know how the country as a whole would figure it all out.</p>

            <p>I agree with JeffMOD. Just because you don’t have something to hide now, doesn’t mean that it’ll be the same a few years from now. Laws change, and giving a government the means to abuse law enforcement infrastructure kind of scares me. It’s a general trend that the laws themselves are not the first to change, rather, it’s the enforcement of law that changes first in many of the dictatorships we see today.</p>
<p>So I am a combination of the Philosopher, the Cryto Nut, and the Conspiracist.</p>
<p>Also, as for the Constitutional Reboot, who will determine what goes in it? Congress? That’s the very last group that I want…</p>

<p>I wouldn’t mind a constitutional reboot. Start from scratch and figure out what laws are actually needed, as opposed to the ones that are there just because people are butthurt about nothing.</p>

            <p>Sage with a hint of Nihilist.</p>
<p>I do wonder why so many people get their panties in a bunch over this… It’s used to monitor dangerous or suspicious behavior of potential terrorists and other criminals. It’s not used to monitor when you and your family are planning that big party for your grandmother who turns 100 or anything (NSA, spoiling surprise parties since 1952).</p>
<p>And sure, there’s the chance of it falling into the wrong hands, but your info may also fall into the wrong hands when you register for… anything, really.</p>
