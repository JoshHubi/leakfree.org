    <description>i just surfed around the web and found this on moddb

this news comes a little late, but for those unaware due to the recent release of a free Team Fortress 2, the Source SDK will soon become free to use in its entirety, for everyone (confirmed by Valve&#39;s Robin Walker in this RockPaperShotgun article). The free SDK was first uncovered in our forums on the 28th of June by an enterprising young man going by the name of Riley, who just happens to be the playtest leader of esteemed Source mods Zombie Panic Source and No More Room In Hell.

This means that all Source mods, made for Valve games (we list around 1,500 for HL2 alone) may eventually be free to play, without requiring you to purchase a Valve game (thou who hasn&#39;t purchased a valve game on this site?)

            <p>If you can get the Source SDK Base, you can play BM.<br>
If you can get the Source SDK/Swarn SDK and know how to make a custom game configuration, you can map for BM.</p>
<p>You should be able to do both with just TF2.</p>

            <p>Yes, but I would like to know how the case is, if you don’t have HL2 on your account. If you only have L4D or no purchased game on your account.</p>
<p>I am just thinking about other people who don’t have HL2 and who would like to know the exact requirements, so that they can decide, which game they buy for making playing and mapping for Black Mesa possible…</p>

            <p>if you own HL2 then you can already make maps in hammer for BM</p>
<p>even if you only have access to the tf2 mapping tools, when you import Black Mesa’s .fgd file into hammer it should be totally set up to make BM maps.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but I already read this page.</p>
<p>The thing is, that it wasn’t officially tested by a Black Mesa developer.</p>
<p>Also there is still the question, if you can create maps for Black Mesa, if you only have Portal 2 or Left 4 Dead or no game in your account, beause you are limited to the MP engine branch and only can select TF2 in these cases.</p>

<li>
<p>Does Black Mesa really work by only having Source SDK Base 2007 (+ 2006) installed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will you be able to set up the Source SDK/Hammer editor to create custom maps for Black Mesa, if you only have a blank account without any purchased game (in this case the SDK only lets you choose the engine branch “Source Engine MP” with “Team Fortress 2”) or if you only have purchased a game like Portal 2 or L4D (because they don’t give you acccess to anything in the default sdk, but come with their own authoring tools).</p>

<p>As long as you have a copy of any source engine game on steam, Black Mesa will cost you nothing.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t see how that statement is incorrect.</p>
<p>You can go make a blank account and there you go a copy of a source engine game (TF2) on Steam.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because as is, it encourages people who doesn’t have a source-game, to purchase one. Which I believe is a nice gesture towards valve. But perhaps that’s just me.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve nothing against supporting Valve by purchasing any of their great games, but not by giving users wrong information!<br>
In the end it was Valve’s own decision to make the Source SDK free to anyone, which makes it legal and possible to play mods without a purchased Source game.</p>
