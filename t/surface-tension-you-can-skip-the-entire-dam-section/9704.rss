    <description>You can climb up on the rock just to the left of the &quot;Black Mesa Hydro-Electric Power Facility&quot; sign and &#39;surf&#39; around to the left, get up on top of the edge of the cliff (you can see and jump out of the level at this point.) ...and then you can jump down right at the pipes and move on from there.</description>

</aside>
<p>I’m surprised they weren’t already there.</p>
<p>I mean, it seemed like whoever made the map really tried to account for this, the brush, or whatever you want to call it, that kills the player when you fall down where you shouldn’t, extends a good deal of the way down the canyon, so if you surf it normally you won’t get far enough and it will still kill you. However, if you do it jusssst right, you can get up on the high rim, walk around the rest of the way, and jump down past the killing zone. Also, the rock faces are nice and steep, so you’d think you wouldn’t be able to get up them, but I usually can find places to do so anyway.</p>
<p>For the second section, I squeezed my way up between two rocks slowly to get up part way, walked around to another spot and then ran/jumped and eased my way up another rock face to get to the top edge. Then it’s pretty easy to run along the top to the end of that section, drop down, and go through the tunnel to the cliff.</p>
<p>Not easy things to find or do… but I did.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Hmm, looks like you can climb up on the rocks and skip the majority of the next section too. :fffuuu:</p>
