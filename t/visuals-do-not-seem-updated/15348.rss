    <title>Visuals do not seem updated</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/visuals-do-not-seem-updated/15348</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing through BM these past couple of days and stumbled upon this video:
[youtube.com/watch?v=2ehCIqvaUik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ehCIqvaUik)
It&#39;s a comparison between BM before and after the Dec 2017 update, and I thought I&#39;d watch it to see what it used to look like. My game looks exactly like the [b]pre[/b]-update shots in the video. Most noticeable is the satellite launch. I&#39;ve enabled all the graphics settings in the Black Mesa panel, and all my graphics settings are maxed out. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m missing something.</description>
