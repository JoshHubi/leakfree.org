I originally started this map as an L4D2 survival map and posted screenies on the forum here. Over the years the map has been sporadically polished and ported to several different games. I finally settled on making it a CS:GO demolition map. So, here it is in a relative state of completion. Tell me what you all think!
Also, if anyone here runs a server and wouldn&#39;t mind putting my map up for a spin that&#39;d be awesome! Unfortunately there&#39;s probably going to be a lot of gameplay problems to iron out so it&#39;d be more for playtesting than for fun ):.</description>
