    <title>Day Dream suggestion thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/day-dream-suggestion-thread/1053</link>
    <description>so there have been ALOT of really outlandish suggestions lately, hopefully (yet not probably) this thread will filter some of them out.

Basicly, if you have something that you wish was in black mesa but it goes against the faq/seems unresonable or is not Half Life&#39;ish, post it here. 

Then modders looking to mod Black Mesa can come and see what is to popular demand, and it will meybe unclutter the suggestion box a little bit.</description>

<p>Not a daydream. Maybe I didn’t clarify that. And it’s even more strange since I hadn’t really had any dreams I could remember for quite a while until recently. I just woke from a really bizarre one too so, what the hell?</p>
<p>Edit: Oh this thread is specifically about daydreaming… Not that big of a deal though right? I just searched for dream and went for the one that looked least dead.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I had a dream that was barely related to Black Mesa so I might as well revive this thread a bit. I was in a huge indoor swimming pool area, and their were tons of people their. They were just in like some kind of huge swimming class. Anyways, their was a huge screen opposite of the side I was on and I decided to hack it. (Don’t know a thing about actual hacking) I changed the at least 18’ tall screen to show the Black Mesa Forum directory.</p>
<p>A minute later announcements came on saying that “we’re having some technical difficulty”. “It seems someone has changed the screen to show some irrelevant website that is unrelated to our program”. Soon after a game over screen started fading in, and knowing I was busted I did a cannon ball into the water just as the game over music and screen took over. (a kind of combination of Mass Effect’s and MGS3’s) It showed a list of my “crimes” as if it was some kind of GTA type game, and it was hilarious that they “busted” me for such a minor offense.</p>
<p>I “reloaded” at the same point but my legs were disabled, they had beat them up I guess. I crawled around for a while and saw one of the “guards”, he was in a wheelchair. I had left a trail of blood or something and the pool now had a shark in it, which smelled the blood and proceeded to chomp on the closest thing to it, which happened to be the wheelchair guy. I found this ironic symbolism overbearingly funny for some reason and then I was woken up.</p>
<p>Also, while I was writing this I think I just noticed what my brain was telling me. I was very recently temporarily banned on this forum for going slightly off topic in the “questions” thread and the ban, temporary as it was seemed excessive. Reading even further into it, you could say that the wheel chair guy was the development team, unable to to talk about their mod especially Xen, which they have vowed to never reveal anything about. And they cannot prevent themselves from falling into the shark’s (complaining fan’s) trap. I don’t know I guess since the Hubicorn quote hype-out I’ve been thinking the development team is really close to release but just is so anxious about releasing it. Probably more than quadruple checking eveything so it is just perfect. Hubicorn’s “soon” quote is probably coming from the fact that the development team has told him they are In release candidate mode, and that he has been working on the new site for quite a while and is almost ready for it to be put up for the release.</p>
<p>Ok I’ve ranted enough (at least for one post) but I just wanted to express myself again.</p>

            <p>i always wanted those surface levels to feel more epic. i remember seeing daylight the first time. remembering. thank you.<br>
omg i needed daylight i couldn’t handle the dark n e more. and then it was taken away from me moments later.<br>
but the scenery always felt a little underdone. now seeings what the devs have done with the dam. i think my dream may already be part of BM.<br>
in that case. im going for a nap.</p>

            <p>I really hope surface tension is actually hectic this time, with gunfire and yelling and jets and shit in the background.</p>
<p>I kinda hope Black Mesa has a Nova Prospekt like atmosphere as well, also with distant echoes of shooting and screaming.</p>

            <p>Just had a thought. It would be cool to hear muffled screams and gunshots coming from other rooms of the facility throughout the campaign… like in the beginning of Doom 3. Actually, exactly like doom 3. Even with the same reverb effect. It just sounded so fucking awesome.</p>

<p>You know what I would REALLY like: For them to release what they have done so far as a beta. No polish, no more work. Just rip the build out of testing and put it onto the net just to tide people over while the dev team finishes it</p>

            <p>Stop saying “Many fans.” It’s those sorts of statements that made devs stop giving out information in the first place. And you do sound like a troll, which is bad, and you should feel bad.</p>

            <p>I don’t want to sound like a troll but saying when it’s done is not really a realistic expectation anymore! Many Black Mesa fans are either saying the mod is dead or will be dead soon, not that it bothers me, I know you guys are doing this for free and have done alot of hard work on this project.</p>
