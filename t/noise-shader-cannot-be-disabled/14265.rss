    <title>Noise shader cannot be disabled</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/noise-shader-cannot-be-disabled/14265</link>
    <description>In the free mod, the option for the noise shader does not work. The game attempts to load it regardless of the option, and since my machine does not support the thing, the screen turns as black as coal whenever I experience radioactivity. I can see the muzzle flash reflections on surfaces in really pale red but it still does not let me see anything.
Due to this, I can&#39;t get past the part where the first mannable railcar stops, in front of the radiating goo.
Basically the option should just make the game completely forget about that shader in some way.
Thanks fo&#39; reading and perhaps fixing this pesky issue.

            <p>If I remember correctly, the mod version also has a bug where if you reload a map, the noise shader will be disabled. You might be able to exploit that to “turn it off”.</p>

<p>Unless an option will be added in the game/paid version to toggle it on/off, it won’t happen. Or maybe there is a console command to toggle it, I don’t know for sure.</p>
<p>The mod/free/legacy/2012 (call it however you want) is no longer supported and will remain as it is from now on.</p>
