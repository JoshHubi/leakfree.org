    <description>[b]Scoreboard:[/b]
-We had a bug when someone was the first with 10kill and 5 death and someone was the second with 10kill and 1death
-Remove bloom from avatars?
-Save scores?
[i]so exidently disconects won&#39;t ruin your score[/i]
-If spectateing you can not be seen on the scoreboard at all

[b]Spectate[/b]
-Remove tf2 style death screen please? :slight_smile: 
[i]It would be nice to see what happens with your enemy after you are dead, for example you want to watch him die in your grenade or slam just like in hl2dm[/i]
-When dead the camera falls half way into the map, I guess thats becouse its on the ground but the view shouldn&#39;t be like that
-Faster respawn time please? :slight_smile: 
-When spectateing you cannot see who you are spectateing
-Add eyeballs to customization preview so it wont be that creepy? :smiley: 
-How about a motd?



[b]Gameplay[/b]
How about a sound that would indicate explosition time on grenades?</description>

<p>That’s exactly my point the DM in general feels like HL2 more than HL1 especially the RPG Rocket. I couldn’t agree more  about the angle thing. But in hl 1 a        skilled player could draw circles in the air with RPG that is what i meant with the speed.</p>
<p>Other than that i can’t stop thinking how cool it would be if we ever get an Adrnaline Gamer mod for this. AG fans like myself would go crazy for an arena       stalkx lel just sayin  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

</aside>
<p>i think the rocket speed is fine, but the rocket is too easy to control… In HL1 it was way harder and needed more skill to maneuver RPG grenades… I think atm RPG grenade tracks the laserdot just like in HL2dm. In HL1 your rocket only followed your laser if the laserdot was in a certain angle infront of your RPG grenade… In HL2DM it doesn’t matter or the angle is a lot wider.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry for posting in the bug reporting forum… I just wanted to answer this guy…</p>

<p>I don’t agree here. In HL you can click and respawn instantly. The deathcam is well done but it doesn’t fit HL1 playstyle. Duel, Deathmatch and TDM need to be fast respawning. Just like it was in HL1 and HL2. You can put these deathcams and spawn-delays in CTF if you really want to keep them in the game.I would also like to see the option “force respawn” in server options (not sure if you have it already). In competetive matches force respawn was always off and maybe it would make sense in public games, too. So maybe just make it default. Also please add sounds for respawners. I hate to defend an area and then suddenly somebody respawns silently behind me and deals great damage or kills me. Not sure if there is respawn-sound yet and if there is none, add one pls. Two other cool things I’d like to get added in future are hospital-style beep-sounds when somebody dies (like in original HL1) and sounds for gibbing other players. Atm there is no gibbing-sound in BM.</p>

            <p>Not sure quite what that video illustrates. dm_boom is meant to be a 2 - 4 player map, so if the spawns get wonky with 16 players, that’s not necessarily the game’s fault. There are kinks in our spawning system we’re in the process of working out.</p>

            <p>Okay I guess if sourcemod will support BM they will make plugins like saveing score<br>
If you are spectateing you cant even be seen if you are on the server, I do not think its good, try half-life 2 deatmatch<br>
There are spectators in scorebords, faster respawns, and no frozen deathscreens</p>

            <p>First off, this isn’t the place for suggestions, this a bug reporting forum, second:</p>
<p>Saving scores is not something that was in any other source game (unless you count competitive CSGO, but that hardly counts).  Not really a bug</p>
<p>Why would you be on the score board if you were spectating, again, not something in source games, not a bug.</p>
<p>Death cam is also in others source games btw, and it is toggle able per server config (or should be since it is that way in CSS and CSGO), again this is not a bug.</p>
<p>Death cam falling into the ground is not something I’ve ever experienced,  show reproducability.</p>
<p>Re-spawn time is plenty fast, not going to get “fixed”.  Compare this to TF2 where some servers have 30 second re-spawn times.</p>
<p>Eyeball thing is not a big deal, and i suspect since eyeballs are separate entities they were removed from the screen to make face template swatching more responsive.</p>
<p>No need for “timer” on grenade, just practice throwing it a few times and you get the hang of it, this is a useless suggestion and again, not a bug.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">Scoreboard:</span><br>
-We had a bug when someone was the first with 10kill and 5 death and someone was the second with 10kill and 1death<br>
-Remove bloom from avatars?<br>
-Save scores?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">so exidently disconects won’t ruin your score</span><br>
-If spectateing you can not be seen on the scoreboard at all</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Spectate</span><br>
-Remove tf2 style death screen please? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">It would be nice to see what happens with your enemy after you are dead, for example you want to watch him die in your grenade or slam just like in hl2dm</span><br>
-When dead the camera falls half way into the map, I guess thats becouse its on the ground but the view shouldn’t be like that<br>
-Faster respawn time please? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
-When spectateing you cannot see who you are spectateing<br>
-Add eyeballs to customization preview so it wont be that creepy? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
-How about a motd?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Gameplay</span><br>
How about a sound that would indicate explosition time on grenades?</p>
