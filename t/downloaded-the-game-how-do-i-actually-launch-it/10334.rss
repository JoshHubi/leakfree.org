    <title>Downloaded the game.. How do i actually launch it?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/downloaded-the-game-how-do-i-actually-launch-it/10334</link>
    <description>So i just downloaded it. and headed towards &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS&quot;. But there is not an icon which allows me to start the game up.

Im a total source noob, so could someone explain to me how to start the game?

EDIT: Game doesnt show up in the steam library also</description>
