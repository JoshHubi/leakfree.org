    <title>Was Freeman this popular before?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/was-freeman-this-popular-before/10538</link>
    <description>First I should say that I&#39;m very grateful to you guys. It&#39;s worth the wait. You deserve every compliments.

There was one little thing that bugged me while playing. It&#39;s not that important and I don&#39;t want to be a complainer since the gameplay was great. But I thought I should report it in order to get it fixed if necessary.

The second HECU marine the player saw in game adresses player by name(Freeman). I was like &quot;Hey, how do you now him? He killed only one marine and it was like a moment ago. How did you get notice of that, that fast in all this chaos..&quot;

Do HECU marines know about Gordon from the start or do they get notice of him after some events?

Anyway it felt odd, and I think it can be discussed here..</description>

            <p>They want Freeman because they suspect he was involved at ground zero, possible sabotage.<br>
Then know it’s him in the HEV because they probably checked the logs, databases and timetables for the Sector C labs, so they know he’s the one that handled the sample.</p>

            <p>Well, according to Opposing Force, <a href="https://img.photobucket.com/albums/v711/nero_orog/Freeman_zps7631b8d5.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Freeman is kind of famous</a>  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>That does beg the question, though - if Freeman fails to show up to work often enough for not-Barney and not-Kleiner to be having a betting pool, how did he win Employee of the Month?</p>

            <p>As stated previously in this thread and many others: It’s a bug pertaining to the flag for the NPC entities whether to acknowledge Freeman by name or not. It will most likely be fixed in a future update. Everyone needs to stop over-analyzing this…</p>

            <p>Well, the marine that talk with the scientist in Op4 seem to be desperate in getting to know where Freeman is, why is he more top priority than all the aliens? My theory is that Gman send in the HECU’s there purposely to test Freeman’s skill and also to see if he was up to the task of being employed by him. There is no way the H.E.C.U’s didn’t go there originally for taking out Freeman it just goes into the genre that the bad guys will stop the good guy and ignore all the issues at hand. This is also why Breen mentions bad things about Freeman, Freeman is seen as a threat by the world he is seen as a terrorist, that’s why they wanted to get rid of him. The aliens just came up in the middle of this.</p>
<p>Opposing Force - The black guy with shotgun interrogating the kleiner-looking scientist - (“Tell us where Freeman is!” - “I don’t know, Freeman could be anywhere!”) See? He is wanted, and he continues to be till the time he was set out of statis in C17’s trainstation.</p>

            <p>If you guys would have listened to the NPC :s , he had a HEV suit and he had a nice reputation in Black Mesa. And, before you got to the old industrial works, the HECU had control over the cameras around Black Mesa, and since he had the HEV suit, which was quite high-technological, it got a lot of attention from the HECUs. So, they tracked Gordon, when he killed so many, then he got even more attention and so forth.</p>

<p>This broke the immersion for me, too – On a Rail was always intended as part of the story where Freeman becomes popular with the Marines.  The “Die Freeman” painted on the wall is the watershed in the story.  Half-life had a toggle on the grunts (as well as the scientists, for pre-disaster chatter) for whether or not they knew Freeman or not.  I’m assuming this is either bugged or not implemented in BMS.</p>

            <p>But their mission is to “contain” the incident, not kill the guy “responsible.” At least not initially. They already planned on killing everyone, and since they were probably contacted by Black Mesa with something along the lines of “Holy shit, there’s monsters and demons and stuff <span class="bbcode-i">everywhere!</span> We need your help, people are <span class="bbcode-i">dying</span>!” they probably had already planned on nuking the place as well. Why would they right off the bat make it priority to kill one guy who barely had any knowledge of what was going on  anyway? Maybe they learned who this army of one who’s been taking down their squads was later on, and then he was a high priority.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I also thought it was a little weird that they knew who Gordon was immediately. I don’t think it’s intended, so whatever.</p>
<p>And the HECU definitely didn’t know about Freeman before they went into Black Mesa. He just became a problem over time. They were just sent in to cover it up and clean up the mess.</p>

<p>Weren’t the HECU’s send in to destroy everyone especially Freeman from since their mission briefing? In Opposing Force everyone talks about Freeman before they have even met him, so he must be recognized as a threat from the military since the very start of their mission.</p>

<p>Not quite. In fact, that was the point of the two marines conversation in On a Rail</p>
<p>-So, have you heard of that Freeman guy? Heard he was at ground zero. Think he’s responsible?<br>
-Maybe. All I know is he’s been killing lots 'o my buddies!</p>
<p>I read that as them not knowing who Freeman is until he starts racking up a kill count and becomes a problem. Clearly, Vance and Cleiner also survived but you never hear them mentioned by name.</p>
<p>As for Opposing Force, I don’t believe Shepard was ever briefed about Freeman until after the crash, and at that point in the game’s timeline, the Marine incursion has been going on for a very long time. In fact, it isn’t long after that that the Marines officially pull out, meaning he first learns of Freemon not too long before Forget About Freeman.</p>

            <p>Isn’t it one of the main motifs of Half-Life? You are a mute faceless anybody, and yet everyone knows you, wants your help/head and fate of whole civilizations is on your shoulders.</p>
<p>Of course HECU know Freeman. Everybody knows Freeman. Vortigaunts in Xen thousand years ago knew Freeman. `Cause he is FREEMAN!</p>

            <p>maybe they hold freeman directly responsible for the incident, as it was him who caused it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yeah, I get that they’d want to track you down since you were one of the few survivors of ground zero as it were. Means that they completely failed when it came to Eli and Kleiner though. You never here them get mentioned, and they were part of the same experiment. Harder to identify I guess.</p>
<p>What the mod did lack a bit was the build up of the soldiers going from merely trying to track you for that reason to outright hating you - they’re already nuts really early on.</p>
<p>Still, the mod is awesome.</p>

            <p>Yeah it threw me for a loop when I already heard someone calling out Freeman in the very first HECU squad I fought, but then I thought about and it kinda made more sense than how HL1 did. I would think the Anomalous Materials crew would be the priority and they’d be coming in knowing in advance on who to look for and there’s very few people running around in HEV suits so it shouldn’t be TOO hard to figure out. Especially since even after all the trouble he’s caused, they still want him for questioning at Apprehension, which means they still think he knows something important, something that I would think they knew in advance</p>
