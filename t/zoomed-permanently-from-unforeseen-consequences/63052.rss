    <title>Zoomed Permanently from Unforeseen Consequences</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/zoomed-permanently-from-unforeseen-consequences/63052</link>
    <description>Occasionally, in the Test Chamber, I noted that the suit would zoom in by itself (usually exiting the Esc menu). Fixable by quickload.
I then completed the insertion, and the suit zoomed in by itself upon getting to the Bullsquid Pond. Fixed by itself.
Then when the &quot;Unforeseen Consequences&quot; chapter title came up, Gordon stands up, and the screen immediately went to zoom. I tried hitting every button I could, but nothing is fixing it. Save/Load remains in zoomed mode, and reloading to chapter heading brings me back to the part when Gordon stands up, and auto-zooms again.

I am using Dvorak keyboard layout, and I remapped &quot;Suit Zoom,&quot; so I don&#39;t know if that has done something bad on the back end, or if it&#39;s a graphics issue.</description>
