    <title>The Xenian Portal, where is it?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-xenian-portal-where-is-it/4502</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, I&#39;ve participated in discussions here.. a little and I know how many cockroaches have been savagely destroyed for their noobness.. so please be gentle? 

I was going to put this in the suggestion box, but this late in development it seems kind of pointless to be suggesting anything at this point doesn&#39;t it? 

This is a question that has always plagued me since the original HL and only heightened after EP1. Where exactly is this dimensional rip the combine eventually &quot;forced ever-wider&quot; that was created by the resident cascade? I know it was created by the &quot;sample&quot; so I assume you would have seen some kind of distortion in the fabric of space time or something in or around the remains of the anti-mass spectrometer since that&#39;s the origin of everything but you don&#39;t. I remember when I was younger, before HL2, wondering if the little dot all the orange &#39;lightening&#39; was coming out at the destroyed tip of the spectrometer was the rip.. but was never sure.

I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not a scientist.. I only control one in the game, XD do I just not understand the science of how the dimensional rip is supposed to be represented as? Any ideas or scientific info people have that can make it clearer would be very appreciated. Also btw.. [b]I know it&#39;s just the game[/b]... I just naturally over analyze lots of things.. which isn&#39;t a bad thing really is it?

The suggestion part of this, which will be completely irreverent if my idea of how the dimensional gash is completely wrong, would be this. Would people think it was cool if like.. somewhere in the spectrometer&#39;s room there was a small distorted portal created from the cascade? Maybe they could use the effect from the end of HL2 with the combine portal but on a much smaller level? That&#39;d be kind of cool wouldn&#39;t it? Maybe we could even see a very faint blurry view of Xen.. kind of like a sneak peek before we get to go there.

Anyway.. that&#39;s call :| *braces for the first senior member&#39;s foot to come smash my roachy self* :fffuuu:</description>

            <p>I always assumed the rift was what allowed the portals to open to begin with.The rift is more a set of circumstances that allow portals to be created, one of the catalysts for a “rift” being a border world such as Zen. Otherwise we would only get local teleportation like apertures portal gun or the combines very limited long range teleportation. The reason the combine needed the citadels was because they already had a rift open to earth, and were unable to open one them selfs. They could keep it open, but couldn’t open one, which explained how they got to earth in the first place.</p>
<p>Shit im drunk and i hope this makes sense to anyone,</p>

            <p>who cares about “how” portals etc work… the question was “where” it occured. The combine were only using Xen as a half way point, and hadnt even reached Xen by the time Gordon was there. So I dont think the nuclear explotion would have affected them… The portal was at Black Mesa.</p>
