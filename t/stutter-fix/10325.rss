    <title>Stutter fix</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stutter-fix/10325</link>
    <description>I posted this elsewhere on the intertubes and someone in that thread said that people here were struggling with stuttering, here&#39;s the fix:


add +fps_max 66 to the additional start command line options in steam.
switch vsync ON, and enable dev console.
in console typed snd_mixahead 0.4

you can mess with the mixahead value. i find 0.4 works well for me.

this fix is about 10yrs old, enjoy  :slight_smile:</description>
