    <title>Import Black Mesa Weapons and Animations into HL2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/import-black-mesa-weapons-and-animations-into-hl2/11642</link>
    <description>I am not sure if this is the right subforum for this, nor if this topic has been done before. Basically, I want to do [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=15113&#39;]this[/url], except the opposite. I want to port Black Mesa skins and animations into Half-Life 2. Well, actually, I only really want the SPAS-12 Shotgun skin and animations from BM. I have both of them installed and on Steam. I have ported over a bunch of custom models and animations so I have basic experience with this.

So, is this possible? If so, how can I do this?</description>
