    <description>What are some parts in Half Life you just hated doing.

For me it&#39;s the level Interloper. It just scares the hell out of me with those ugly walls and the 4 different levels that are filled with vortigaunts that rape you with green shit and the boxes that have alien grunts in them if you break them open and you get little health but for the blue things that refill your life forces and it&#39;s just like damn man. Damn.</description>

</aside>
<p>… when you get the motor boat is the start of a new chapter… water hazard… so basically route canal was good till the very end part… my favourite part though was when you were going through those slums which were getting shelled right before you get the motor boat with zombies coming out of the water…</p>
<p>I remember Highway 17 for the highlights… the part right after you get the car up onto the platform after the tedious crane bit and the fights that ensue with the gunship… you can take it out quickly but it’s a great place to play around with the AI… and yes, the bridge section.</p>

            <p>So yea.</p>
<p>HL1 is ossum up until On a Rail, once that’s over, it starts getting good again, until you get to Interlopers… And then the game just sucks all the way through to the end.</p>
<p>It’s weird that one can have happy memories of a game, and ind the end it turns out that half the game is actually pretty damn horrible… But still you love it in its whole.</p>

            <p>Highway 17 was good but in my opinion it was the weakest chapter of HL2, except for Bridge Point which was awesome.</p>
<p>They should’ve made Highway 17 shorter and gone with their original idea of going into the antlion caves.</p>

            <p><img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> … Route Kanal was one of my favourite chapters in how it set the atmosphere of the scene… I loved the feeling of danger and the eerie silence of old rebel bases, set up Water Hazard brilliantly.<br>
I also liked Highway 17…</p>
<p>Honestly the only parts I disliked were the ones with AI teammates in Follow Freeman who just got in the way and didn’t know how to take cover.</p>
<p>In Half-Life I really didn’t mind on-a-rail… not my favourite… but I think of any section Xen is the one that I think could’ve been done a lot better… It wasn’t BAD… but it just didn’t feel up to the same level as the rest of the game… fighting the Nihilanth was fun the first time though.</p>

            <p>On A Rail just…needed an atmosphere that couldn’t be done well on Goldsrc, it could be done much better in Black Mesa, it should more obviously give the player the feel that this is a nearly abandoned section. Cobwebs?</p>

            <p>I’ve read the first five pages of the topic and I myself still don’t understand the hate for Highway 17.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty awesome.</p>
<p>The only parts of the series I hated was your AI controlled teammates. At least for the antlions you could just shoot them to get out of the way of a door you’re DESPERATELY trying to run through, but your human companions were a pain in the ass ending up getting you killed or just annoying the hell out of you.</p>

            <p>The low point of the whole series for me was ‘Follow Freeman’. The rebel AI was absolutely terrible. I remember on multiple occasions that the rebels would cluster around grenades, block my path, and mysteriously abandon me/disappear at loading points. NOT FUN.</p>
<p>On another note, I’m suprised that so many people disliked Highway 17. I loved the exploritive element of it, the way the player set the place, and the whole bridge sequence. That level was probably my favorite one in HL2.</p>

            <p>I know I already posted here, but you guys reminded me that the boid level in Xen has got to be my least favorite.  So what’s the “correct” way of doing it?  Riding the pillar or butthole-cannon?  Can’t remember which route I took originally, but I know I tried them all and didn’t have much fun  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>i have to say i had a positive (&lt; hate that word) attitutde (&lt;that one 2) towards Hl and Hl2. even on a rail was fun for me…with hax. My favorite part is Anti-citizen 1, cuz all the citizens fought back at the big-bad combine. You have to admit you loved to see the Breen-screen fall, when the rebels got to it. The episodes were kinda bland to me. Both episodes were focused mostly on the combine, and it realy sucked out the classic, hit-the-zambie-with-that-crowbar feeling you get exclusive to the HL series. Hell, im pissing my pants waiting for Ep 3 to come out, but will never say the Episodes really got into the series.</p>

            <p>HL1: Can’t think of anything, I even liked “On a Rail”.<br>
HL2: I didn’t like Nova Prospect that much, but more because of the setting than because of the gameplay.<br>
EP2: Defending the launching platform got dull after the 5th strider accompanied by hunters or so.</p>

            <p>Am I the only one who loved On A Rail and Xen?  The only part of Xen I hated was Gonarch and the one with all the big boids flying around.  A few less ass-rape-happy vortigaunts in the factory would have been cool, but, nonetheless, I still loved the factory (Interloper?).</p>
<p>ANYWAY: Disliked levels</p>
<p>HL1:  Stupid boid level mentioned above<br>
HL2:  Beach sequence.  Not that it’s hard or anything, it’s just boring after the first time, and I find myself just running across the sand to get it over with every playthrough, unless I’m feeling especially dedicated.<br>
EP1:  The whole underground area.  Other than the 3-story car-park and final lift arena, I hated it all for some reason.  The dark atmosphere was awesome, I just didn’t like the level for some reason<br>
EP2:  OMG!  I don’t know if it’s just me, but every time I do the final level, with all the striders, I’ll take down the first two or three, and then, while I’m taking down the second or third, or whichever one it is, a strider will spawn northeast of the sawmill, and move impossibly fast to a location about a GODDAMNED MILE AWAY from the sawmill, and obliterate it.  That’s the only achievement I can’t get.  Goddamned strider.  I’m seriously thinking about cheating in, spawning magnussons all over so I don’t have to wait for one to spawn or stop to pick one up, then turning off cheats and restarting the game to take that fucker down.</p>
<p>I know I keep getting off track, but I loved the sequence with Alyx dead and all the antlions and vortigaunts.  It was fun, didn’t drag on, and had neat music.</p>
<p>There’s just so many parts of half-life that I loved that trying to name one that I hate always brings my mind by so many other things, that I just can’t not let be made known.</p>
<p>Reading more posts: I add to my own justification for why I enjoyed On a Rail:  I just love trams.  End of story, that’s what made it enjoyable for me…  Sad, I know.</p>
