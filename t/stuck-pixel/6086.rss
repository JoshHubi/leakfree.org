    <title>Stuck pixel</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stuck-pixel/6086</link>
    <description>So for Christmas, my parents gave me an iPod Touch, and it was all cool, until a couple of hours after, when I noticed that there was a stuck pixel, permanently white.

I then searched if there was anything I could do about it, and it seems that apps that can flash all colours really fast sometimes fixes the problem, so I was wondering if anybody knew any apps in the app store that can do just that?

Thanks.</description>

            <p>I don’t know why I didn’t think of that :retard:</p>
<p>But thanks, I’ll try it out.</p>
<p>And I just figured that I might as well try and see if I can fix it myself before deciding to return it.</p>
