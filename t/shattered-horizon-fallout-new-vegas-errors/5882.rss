    <title>Shattered Horizon/ Fallout New Vegas Error&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shattered-horizon-fallout-new-vegas-errors/5882</link>
    <description>Hi, just wandering if anyone can help with this.

I have both games, BUT unless i re-install my GPU drivers (GTX480) every time I play want to play either game, they will either, black screen on start-up (shattered horizon) or Stop working error on loading game (fallout)

both work like a dream once I re-install drivers and there are NO problems after that.

Just wandering if anyone has a hunch as it&#39;s an inconvenience. would like to put it at a stop if possible.

Thanks.  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>i heard it had something to do with memory leakage, and face rendering.</p>

<p>^ Your not alone, I started a thread a while ago about two performance mods, and I think the new face rendering is what’s screwing you over.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Once you get it working correctly you’ll love it, FNV is in my top ten favorite games</p>
