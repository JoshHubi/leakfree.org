    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/messed-up-models-and-particles-i-do-not-believe-this-is-a-bug/12070</link>
    <description>okay so installed a few mods(to black mesa), but the last one mess up the files, so i when and moved out the newer one with one that shouldn&#39;t have issues, but it did, so i made a new set of files and put them in, still failed, 
the issues are
1. the eye texture is missing 
2. particle system is goofy and i can tell isn&#39;t working right
3. all models are the bloody versions
here is a screensshot i took when noclipping around in the frist chapter 
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=125489572[/url]

so is there any way to fix this 


my system: win 8(it was formally win 7, but then i upgraded because i don&#39;t like win 7 i had a laptop burn out on win 7, so i hate it, and that is not the issue i have been playing it before no issue before i installed mods(to black mesa, so don&#39;t say go back to 7, as i hate it -_-)
and other hl2 mods installed: missing information, and fortress forever
half life 2 and it&#39;s episodes work okay without issue, it&#39;s just black mesa</description>
