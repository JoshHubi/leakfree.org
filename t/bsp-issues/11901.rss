    <description>I just set up my Hammer Editor to work with Black Mesa. Everything is working like it is supposed to, except for compiling. When I go to run a test map, it says that there is no .bsp file in the current location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS\maps

What gives? I saved them in that location, but it is telling me I didn&#39;t. Anybody know how to fix this?</description>
