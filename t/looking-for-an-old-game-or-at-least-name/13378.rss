    <title>Looking for an old game (or at least name)?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-for-an-old-game-or-at-least-name/13378</link>
    <description>So one of my friends is looking for an old (probably DOS) FPS game, but neither of us know the title. Here&#39;s his description:

you are some kind of robot(?) you have 2 laser guns and you float around instead of walking, and you begin in a place with dark blue ambience... I don&#39;t know it&#39;s something like that... as you go further through the level, you would see someone just walking around up above you with red laser barrier as his window(?) anyway... you go further and you encounter kind of robotic enemies

Sorry it&#39;s really vague, but he doesn&#39;t remember much.</description>

            <p>Could be it too. He said “old pc game”, he didn’t specify if it was Windows or DOS.</p>
<p>EDIT: That’s it! Thanks Dreadmoth.</p>

            <p>Maybe it was a Windows 3.x or Windows 95 game?</p>

            <p>He says it’s none of these, but he’s fairly interested in Skaphander: Der Auftrag. At that rate it’s probably not something we can find tbh. I’d assume by floating around he means hovering near the ground.</p>
