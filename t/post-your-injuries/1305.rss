    <description>I broke my finger yesterday playing soccer as a goalie. Apparently the bone broke and twisted so they&#39;re going to have to surgically twist it back into place and keep it still with a titanium pin. Here&#39;s a picture:

I&#39;ve been told that after the surgery I can&#39;t so finger-related sports for about six months which sucks because my team had two tournaments planned abroad, one next Saturday and another in October.

So, basically what have you ever been hurt doing? Do you have a picture of it? Did it stop you from doing something?</description>

            <p>I was waterskiing and fell out of them when I hit an airpocket. I surfaced ahead of my skis and one hit me in the side of the head. I got a skull fracture and had to be air lifted to the hospital where I got a big helping of emergency brain surgery. I have a giant question mark scar on one side of my head which I now cover with my hair. Doctor said it was a miracle I survived, nevertheless with no brain damage. Check my dev account for a picture.<br>

            <p>My hubby was climbing a ladder to take the shutters down off the house.  He didnt place the ladder close enough to the house so when he got high enough, the ladder slid down the house and he landed holding the ladder.  The violent landing on the ground broke off one of those little knobbies that are at the elbow bone, and then it whipped the knobbie around to the front in the crook of the elbow.</p>
<p>The doctor made a point to tell him that while this type of break is seen perhaps one time ever in a doctors whole career, my hubbies was the second in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Surgery and cast came after.</p>

            <p>Actually I once replaced my thumb because it was off the hole and I was doin’ okay after. Sure it hurts but not much. Same thing goes for a friend who felt on his wrist. Difference is he had to get a plaster or whatever it’s called.</p>

            <p>I kicked my smaller left toes really hard yesterday during a leap. I think there’s a hairline fracture in my second-to-smallest metatarsal, and another in one of my pinky phalanges. Within the half-second that I fell on the ground aware of what I’d done, I instinctively voiced <span class="bbcode-i">Medic!</span> in that whisper one gets when they’re trying to be loud without being loud enough to hear.</p>
<p>Speaking of foot injuries, I evidenced an injury a few months ago.<br>
The effect of barnacles, salt-water, and one firm surface with which to crack a toenail.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Poor left foot. I suppose my right one learned its lesson early on.</p>

            <p>My right arm was stabbed open during a football drill because some dude didn’t have his helmet on right (I think his chinstrap had something to do with it) and he was wicked short.</p>
<p>My left hand has various glass and pocket knife scars, but that’s about it. I’ve been hit by cars and I still haven’t broken anything.</p>
<p>I’m either ultra-cautious or I need to get out more.</p>

            <p>Dude I broke my middle finger playing hockey. I put my hand in the air to call for the puck and this fat ass kid decided it was a good idea to do a slap shot at my hand, lucky day…it hit. My finger looked messed up, but i got no pictures.</p>
<p>I do got some pictures of a old foot injury, I  landed on a beer bottle while trying to swing on a tire swing into a creek. Ill upload later its pretty gruesome and you can see bone and tendon ohhh.</p>

            <p>I don’t think the forum layout supports the amount of text and images it would require to list all the major injuries I’ve suffered, notably from football and lifting.</p>

            <p>I broke my finger yesterday playing soccer as a goalie. Apparently the bone broke and twisted so they’re going to have to surgically twist it back into place and keep it still with a titanium pin. Here’s a picture:</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8efee311654ef56770cc738f2e41a7317c1f6ac5.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="koZTpbxrScsCwgNx07KCeIINUI5" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>I’ve been told that after the surgery I can’t so finger-related sports for about six months which sucks because my team had two tournaments planned abroad, one next Saturday and another in October.</p>
<p>So, basically what have you ever been hurt doing? Do you have a picture of it? Did it stop you from doing something?</p>
