            <p>Also when in lambda labs right before a scientist is supposed to let you out in the lobby, one scientist was just stuck staring at the keypad until a barney came along (he was really slow for some reason). I don’t know why it has to wait for the barney before opening the door.<br>
Only the scientist had scanner access anyways remember?<br>
Most people playing this run as fast as they can to the next objective. NPCs really should be able to keep up.</p>

            <p>Noticed that too, I didn’t put it as clearly as you did, but here’s my original topic noting the same bug: <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/27997-Scientist-Idle-Animations/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Scientist Idle Animations.</a></p>

            <p>Not only that, but a lot of the barneys don’t even use their hands  when performing scripted sequences…</p>
<ol>
<li>the barney that follows you to the front lobby in UC doesn’t interact with the phone to call for help, he just stands their and talks to it</li>
<li>the barney in QE, after the final firefight in the main lobby he used to raise his gun at the airlock when the scientist was about to open it, now he doesn’t.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s a lot more little gestures like that the guards use to do, but now don’t.</p>
