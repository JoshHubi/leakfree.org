Valve might also be making a game abbreviated SOB that involves space flight.</description>

<p>Considering the arctic location this time, it could be used pretty awesomely.</p>
<p>Melting blocked (alternate) passages or thawing items would be an obvious one.</p>
<p>How about a situation where you have the drop on an unsuspecting enemy, you notice a large stalactite-like hunk of ice that can be relatively quietly melted at a certain point and make the baddy go squishy. Alternatively, if you shoot it, the shock of the bullets will ‘destabilise’ the ice, causing it to break up when it hits and deal a bit of damage to the obviously gunfire-alerted, moved enemy and disorient them for a moment.</p>
<p>Also, there could be a new type of small, swarming enemy that is best dealt with by flames at close-range and explosions farther away (other methods could work, just not quite as well). Altho not so sure I’d be a fan of that type of an enemy, as it could become very annoying, but hopefully it would be limited or balanced .</p>

            <p>Thank you for the feedback Dias. What you say does make sense. And you could well be right. I don’t mean to insult anyone. I just took offense when you shut down what I had to say straight away, saying I got my sources from, well… <em>ahem</em> my colon. If you knew what I was talking about why didn’t you post the link to LambdaGen yourself instead of trying to make me look like I didn’t know what I was talking about? When I read that article, there were some suggestions that there could have in fact been some truth to it after LambdaGen did some digging themselves.</p>
<p>I don’t insult anyone who doesn’t insult me. Let’s just agree to disagree, none of us have a clue what we are talking about except Valve anyway. So lets just be friends shall we? With my brains and your brawn, we’ll make an excellent team!</p>

</aside>
<p>Mike Dussault was a programmer at Valve who left. That is absolutely true &amp; anybody could have told you that because there was an article on LambdaGeneration about it back in July. Everything else, from him being a freelance artist artist to the resume he found is completely unverifyable &amp; easily made up. You keep claiming that knowing about him leaving valve is some form of proof when it’s not. There is no contradiction.</p>

<p>Where does he say you wouldn’t find HL3? I think the point he was making was that ep3, hl3 or whatever other name they decide to use for their cpp files is just that, a label.</p>

</aside>
<p>Chet said that if you went into the original Half Life source code now, you’d probably find mention of unrelated stuff labelled ‘HL3’. Those were his exact words. I looked through the HL SDK &amp; found no traces of anything that used HL3 other than a numbered save file in my game folder. I also said that his reply was quite strange because he wasn’t asked about HL3, he was asked about the DOTA2 leak with the ep3 files &amp; no trace or mention of HL3.</p>

</aside>
<p>You said that since it’s taken more than 4 years since EP2 to make EP3 that they’ve left EP3 &amp; the episodic model &amp; moved on to HL3 as a full-length game. My point was that development time has absolutely nothing to do with the length of a game &amp; was using DNF as an example. Honestly, I’m not trying to confuse you, it was just a simple reference that I thought would be easy enough for anyone to understand, but I guess I was wrong.</p>

<p>I wasn’t trying to be a “smarty pants” I just figured you knew about that article too. You were so quick to tell me to read the LambdaGen article again (&amp; again) &amp; to “do some research” that I thought you knew there was an article on the site from July saying that Mike D. left valve a year ago (when the post ryuuk said he left recently) so you’d know that his knowledge of when Mike D left valve was absolutely meaningless. I’m not witholding info to use against you to make me look smart, I’m giving you more credit by assuming you did the research!</p>

I’m not going to explain again, just go back and read down from my original post before running your mouth on here. I mean really, you couldn’t have picked something more irrelevant to quote me on. I do hope you read more then that.</p>

<p>Note for dumb. I got angry because you defended a mad idea despite the lack of any kind of evidence and ignored all the logical things Dias told you. Let’s see an example of your noble civil discussion: “You’re trying to look like a smarty pants but frankly, I think you are just full of shit.” Anyway I don’t have time for another Shasta, have fun trollin’ nigga. Peace out</p>

            <p>I’m just excited it will have some new weapons, I got bored using the same ones over and over. I also like the idea of the putting the Tau Cannon back in but not so much the Gluon Gun. I never really used it because of how fast it sucked up ammo.</p>

<p>I have every right to defend what I have to say thank you very kindly sir. Dias, said I had nothing to back up my accusations. I wasn’t going to take that bollix so I presented him with my argument, an argument that was legit, an argument that was on topic and made sense.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with me having a say Mastershot? Are you some arrogant prick who has a cry when someone has an opinion different to his own or just another 15 year old ego driven retard who couldn’t think of anything more intelligent to add to the conversation other then 'oh hi guys, i haven’t been here in a while. shut the fuck up. and you fail. :rabies: ’ ?</p>

<p>Good point. Valve are smart though, if they do bring out HL3 before ep3, either they will do it the way you’re assuming, or open up another story arc and make it somehow blend in with the end of episode 2. They seemed to do it pretty well with HL and HL2. I certainly didn’t expect to go from Black Mesa to waking up in a city 17.</p>
<p>True about the HL1 expansions and the HL2 episodes.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For the 3rd or 4th time go back, and read the article. It will tell you that the guy he mentions, his resume’, his time employed at Valve, and when he left is all Legit. Your argument is flawed because it proves nothing. It’s a leak that references files to ep3 - This means nothing except at some point ep 3 was in development. You can’t say that it still is, and I can’t say that it’s not. Stop speculating on what ‘you’ want, and look at the evidence. Do some research yourself before trying to make out like I don’t know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>This is what Valve had to say on the DOTA 2 leak, and what I am basing my assumptions on:</p>
<p>“Anything people get out of that rumour, they shouldn’t take it as meaning  anything,” Chet Faliszek told us at a London presentation of Counter Strike: Global Offensive. “I mean, I guarantee that if you went into the original Half Life source code now, you’d probably find mention of unrelated stuff labelled ‘HL3’ there already. Its just the way it happens.”</p>

<p>How is my argument flawed? A guy posted a rumor he could have easily pulled out of his ass on a forum &amp; got banned vs an actual leak that references files. It’s a pretty solid argument.</p>

<p>This is the best you’ve got?..</p>
<p>… Again, go back, and read the entire article before you start making yourself look like a complete idiot. I’ve also already explained this.</p>
<p>It’s not a matter of me wanting it you twit. The fact that you’re trying to pick apart what I say without any substantial back up of your own claims tells me you know your argument is probably flawed but you just don’t want to let it go. Similar to that of a small child.</p>
<p>Not to mention your comebacks are quite trivial and really don’t do a lot for your argument. Stop quoting me, go away, do some actual research and put together something more solid then “Because I want this”.</p>

<p>Of course they won’t rewrite an entirely new engine from the ground up. No doubt it will be built onto the Source Engine just as Source was built on from the Gold-Source Engine just as the Gold-Source Engine was built on from the Quake Engine.</p>

<p>Just because there is a good chance that they have “moved on” to HL3 doesn’t mean that they would scrap their work on Episode 3.  Who knows how much work they actually did on it before Ep2 was released?  It might just be easier to label everything as Ep3 if they’d done enough work on it.</p>
<p>And, even though they’ve admitted that episodes are a horrible idea for them, doesn’t mean they have rebranded Episode 3 as HL3.  They might release it as Episode 3 still, just to finish out the trilogy they originally set out to create.  Of course, the opposite is true, they may call it Half-Life 3 just to cement in the fans the idea that they are done with episodes.  Either way, it will be the same game with the same content, and that’s all I care about, personally.</p>

</aside>
<p>Half-Life 1, was a major, major break through in Video game technology back in it’s day. Cutting edge graphics, mixed with an amazing ability to tell the game’s story through the eyes of they player. Half-Life, had it’s own episodes created by Gearbox, these were known as Half-Life: Opposing-Force and Half-Life: Blue Shift. These addons, or ‘episodes’ were created with the same game engine, and set in a similar universe. To keep this short, this was the same scenario that took place with Half-Life 2. Evolutionary for it’s time, cutting edge graphics, game play and story telling. And of course, HL2: EP1 and 2 were brought out not long after on the same engine, in the same universe.</p>
<p>Now if Valve are working on HL3… Trust me, it’s not going to be the same game as ep3 was intended to be. My point is, if episode 3 does come out, it will be on the Source Engine. If it’s HL3, it will be an unrecognizable rework of what ep3 might of been, and it will probably be piloting Valves new Game Engine, just as every other Half-Life sequel has.</p>
