    <description>Title. Go. I&#39;ll start with Imonfire&#39;s question in the Chat thread.
[quote=&quot;Imonfire&quot;]
Okay so I&#39;m a toothpick too. I&#39;m 5&#39;11&quot;, and I weigh 140 pounds. I&#39;m really skinny. So what should I do if I want to get bigger, or bulk like you said? Eating a lot, okay. But what should I eat? Salad, junk, protein? And what exercises should I do? Right now I only have a bench and a couple of loads (is that the good word?) that you&#39;d probably lift up with one arm.
[/quote]
First protip: I can only generalize so much before shit starts becoming too vague and inaccurate. Everyone is different. Very different.

For a strength training program I reccomend Madcow&#39;s 5x5. It&#39;s a very solid program for newbies and intermediates to lifting.

You would be wise to also register here and download this spreadsheet to simplify the program and percentages. The whole concept of deloading and ramping weights can be intimidating to new guys at first.

Now remember, 50% of everything you ever gain or lose is done in the kitchen. 25% of the rest is training, and the other 25% is rest and recovery.

[url]https://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/[/url]

To start with your diet, use the above link to find your BMR. This is not going to be a spot on number, but it will give you a general idea of how many calories you would burn by sitting and doing nothing all day.

This number is now your enemy. Your goal is to eat at least 500-800 calories over your maintenance levels every day. Maintenance levels are the amount of calories you burn total the entire day. This includes anything strenuous; running, lifting, doing yard work, anything that burns calories is factored into this. Say one day you are resting and don&#39;t do shit that entire day. You only need to eat 500-800 calories over your actual BMR. Simple. But, the next day you lift, help your grandma do some gardening, move furniture for a neighbor, and do 30 minutes of cardio jogging around the block. Say all that burned a total of 1000 extra calories. You now need to eat 1500-1800 calories over your BMR to compensate. Your body only produces muscle from excess calories.

Bulk diets are a lot simpler than most teenagers want to make them. Your best friends are going to be items such as peanut butter, eggs, tuna, any lean meats such as chicken, turkey, and lean cuts of beef. Healthy fats such as olive oil and the fats in peanut butter are also good for you. As I said, I can only generalize so much before I have to start being ignorant, so you have to ask questions for me to keep narrowing this down for you.

A protip: you will gain body fat when you bulk. This is nearly inevitable. Some ectomorphs can bulk without gaining a sliver of bodyfat, but if you&#39;re a toothpick right now, chances are you are not ecto. Bodyfat is not a bad thing as long as it doesn&#39;t get out of control. You don&#39;t need to look like those bitch ass Abercrombie models when you&#39;re bulking. You will not see your precious skinnyfat six-pack, nor will you be &quot;shredded&quot;. You are going to gain fat. Your only release from this fat is to successfully bulk and then cut later. I&#39;ll explain cutting when you get to that stage, if you choose to.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I seem to be experiencing a bit of a crest in my ability to go up in weight. Be it squats, or benchpress, or rows, or deadlift I seem to have sorta leveled off in my ability to go up weight.<br>
For example, three weeks ago I maxed out on the bench at 5 reps of 93Kg. From then on I can seem to breach this. On one or two days I might be able to do one maybe two reps of 95Kg, but nothing more. It seems pretty much the same over the past three weeks. It’s a similar story with my other exercises. Is this normal? Is this a sign I need to be upping my workout intensity. I tried following the routine for madcows as best I can with my schedule, and seen decent results, but this wall is concerning to me.</p>

            <p>Well I think I’m progressing well. I’ve moved upto benching 5 reps of 42.5kg and today I managed to squat 60kg. Last week I deadlifted 70kg, I’ll try and improve on that this Wednesday. The one exercise I’m having a bit of trouble with is the barbell row. I don’t know if I have the right form. I keep on feeling like I’m going to fall forward. Is this normal or am I just doing a weight that is too heavy?</p>

            <p>Yes, but until that pain expires your muscles are still damaged.  If anything, you’ll see the most muscle right after the soreness ends.  It’s your body’s way of saying “Hey, don’t use this muscle much, it’s worn out.  But we’ll get it back into working condition, or better, before you know it!”</p>

            <p>Yo Kaze, I’ve been following madcows 5x5 for the last two weeks and have been seeing some improvements. I’ve managed 5 reps of 42.5kg on the bench and today I deadlifted 70kg. But one thing is bothering me. Before when I used to do a three day split of upper body, I used to feel the pain after each workout ie DOMS. I don’t feel that anymore. Is this a bad thing? I’ve always heard that if you don’t feel the pain after a workout, then it was a shitty workout.</p>

            <p>Thinking of getting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strength-Training-Anatomy-Frederic-Delavier/dp/0736063684/ref=sr_1_1/191-9993529-1488148?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1248578554&amp;sr=1-1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this bitch.</a>  Besides being very helpful with the vast number of exercises it outlines, it also thankfully highlights the muscles each exercise works.  Besides that, it should really help me with biology/human anatomy, which I wish to pursue.</p>
<p>Good idea?</p>

<p>Fuck this squatting. Its pissing me off. Does it matter if your feet are pointing slightly out? Again, I find more balance this way, rather than them pointing forward and being parallel to each other.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you have poor balance, you should work on your core abdominal muscles; they have a lot to do with your balance.  Lie on your back and draw your bellybutton in.  Don’t suck it in so much as draw it in.  When you’re doing it right, you should feel them clenching (they’re right along the top of your pelvis).  Once you can clench them, there are a number of exercises you can do for them; probably the most common ones are leg lifts of varying types.</p>
<p>The proper form for a leg lift is to keep your lower back and pelvis completely stationary while your legs move.  If you’re lying on your back, you can cram your thumbs underneath yourself into the low of your back, then press down on them.  Try to keep that same amount of pressure on your thumbs throughout the exercise.  (And of course, keep the core muscles clenched throughout the exercise, too.)</p>

<p>Try putting those leather carpet thingies (I forgot how the called) on both sides of yourself to prevent your feet from wobbling if you are not confident. After a while, you’ll forget about even thinking of them pointing outwards.</p>

            <p>I read the blog but not the reader comments.  It sounded like that guy just confirmed what Kaze said.  He also sounded like an amateur (if he was still doing things the same way he did them when he first started lifting).</p>

<p>Anyone can Google something that agrees with what they are saying on an internet forum.  We appreciate people that have actual personal experience as opposed to those that are just playing the devil’s advocate.  You could start your own thread about improper lifting techniques if you are so inclined to mislead people.</p>

<p>Yes, the article is biased. The person who wrote it is apparently clueless because they somehow managed to only now discover lifting without gloves. Meaning they most likely do curls for da gurlz in the squat rack.</p>
