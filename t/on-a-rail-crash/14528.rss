    <title>On A Rail Crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/on-a-rail-crash/14528</link>
    <description>Looking through the forum for an answer, I saw 2 others that also had this problem, but never seem to see a response and both have had threads about it since May. The load screen immediately after setting up the launch platform for the satellite rocket, causes my game to crash. This crash never happened to me until the Crossfire Update, but it seems it has been happening since soft release mod days.</description>
