    <title>Game Crashes at certain point in Office Complex</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-at-certain-point-in-office-complex/62968</link>
    <description>I have reached a certain point (about 2 hours in) at the Office Complex and I can no longer go any further before the game crashes, no errors, just closes.

I have 3 DMP files but says they&#39;re not the correct format to upload, can anyone help?</description>
