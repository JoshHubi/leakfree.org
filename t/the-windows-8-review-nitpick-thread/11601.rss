    <title>The Windows 8 Review/nitpick Thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-windows-8-review-nitpick-thread/11601</link>
    <description>Ok so windows 8 was released in the last few days and there are a lot of mixed reviews so I would like to see the opinions of the people of this forum. I myself unfortunately upgraded (if its even called upgrading) to windows 8 and have found myself completely lost as to where things are and I am pretty tech savvy having just graduated from an IT course this past June. 8 seems to be lacking some of the key features that every version of windows has had to date and that bothers me i should have done some research first. 

I find this operating system quite cool looking but that&#39;s just about it so far for me. I am having a lot of trouble with video after the upgrade my games work flawless maybe even better but I cant seem to play the simplest videos without them skipping and stuttering. I also noticed a lot of things are opening just a bit quicker but the windows themselves seem to lag when I move them around and I shouldn&#39;t be getting that with the system I have.

If anyone has any type of review or nitpick and maybe even a solution to some of the issues you may have had whether they are the same or different then mine I would like to see it

My Specs:
Windows 8 64 Bit :fffuuu:
Core i7 920 @2.67GHz
EVGA X58 Le Motherboard
2x BFG Geforce 280 in Sli
24 GB of Kingston Hyperx Ram
60GB Solid State Drive for operating system

If there has already been a thread dedicated to the release of windows 8 by all means a mod can move this thread to its respectful location!</description>

<p>Then the red rings… red ringed?</p>

            <p>Assuming Microsoft doesn’t start seeping into only touchscreen-based/oriented OSs, I think I’ll wait to upgrade until the NEXT Windows version. Maybe they’re realize they stepped on too many toes with this one.</p>

            <p>I’ve read nothing but negative reviews about Windows 8, from the fact that there are 2 internet explorers, control panels, windows update centers and only one way to shut down your computer, using hidden gestures.</p>
<p>And Windows RT on an official microsoft tablet is reportedly incapable of keeping up with a human typing in Word, and brings up a login screen loop when trying to save a document. (when you log-in successfully the login screen shows up again, without saving your document)</p>
<p>If you want to keep your desktop or laptop easy to use, stay AWAY from windows 8.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty broke, so I can’t upgrade, but I did use that preview thing they had months ago. I liked it. Sure, the lack of the old start menu was irritating, but the replacement wasn’t terrible. It seemed more or less like modified Win7, to me. But then again, that was the preview, so the full version may differ.</p>

            <p>I’ve been hearing a lot that Windows RT is quite good, but that Windows 8 is more or less pointless for desktop users. I’m interested in trying an RT tablet now after reading anandtech’s review, but I don’t think I’ll be upgrading my desktop to 8.</p>
