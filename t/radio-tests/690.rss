    <description>While I was making sounds for the Zombarney&#39;s, I was just messing around to see how much Radio-like I could make a sound, With the help of a few programs.
(Audicity, MorphVOX, etc)

So I just thought I&#39;d show you 1 and see what you thought of it. It will still have some crackling in it as it is finallized.
