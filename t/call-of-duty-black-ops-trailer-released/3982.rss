[quote]
There&#39;s a brand new Call of Duty game coming this year. This Friday, you&#39;ll get your first peek at the follow-up to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, courtesy of GameTrailers TV. While Activision may be embroiled in drama related to its most recent Call of Duty, that won&#39;t stop the company from churning out annual sequels to the ultra-popular first-person shooter. In 2010, Call of Duty: World at War developer Treyarch is on tap to deliver a new iteration, already penciled in to ship before the &quot;holiday.&quot;
It represents the first Call of Duty game to be released under publisher Activision&#39;s new &quot;strategic plans&quot; for the franchise.
GameTrailers TV&#39;s promo promises a &quot;global announcement&quot; and &quot;the first teaser trailer&quot; for Call of Duty 7, so make sure you&#39;re up at 12:40 a.m. with your eyes glued to Spike TV to catch it.

            <p>I have my hopes high, even though I predict it’ll be shitty anyway. WaW is the best CoD game to date. I hope Black Ops will be better. Also: BM CoD?</p>

            <p>Well since there has never been a game based both in Nam and in the future at least it is vaguely original, which is more than can be said for most shooters these days.</p>

            <p>watching frame by frame something strikes me. it looks like black ops will stretch from end of Nam to early future. and the way they talk to the “patient” in the video it looks as though all the clips are his memories. will he be a clone or something? and is call of duty going sci-fi? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
i gotta be honest this doesn’t look like a step in the right direction especially after MW2</p>

            <p>Nazi Zombies was so much fun! And BTW, MW2 wasn’t that bad. That said, it and CoDWaW are the only two CoDs I’ve played so what seems old and repeated to you is new and fresh to me.</p>

            <p>Dont feed the troll. If he actually knew anything then he would’ve known that all the COD games are linear, monotonous, and predictable. MW2 is no exception to that.</p>

No, seriously, comparing to MW2 it was waaaaaaaaaay too linear, monotonous and predictable.<br>
Isn’t that right?</p>

<p>What…?  At least WaW had a good single player, MW2 got really boring really quick.  Following people around for the entire game, yeah, no thanks.  Complete waste of my 60 bucks…  Serves me right for buying another Cod game after CoD4.</p>

            <p>Hell, as long as it’s not WWII I’ll try it.<br>
But if it has exaggerated dismemberment like Waw, It’s not worth buying.<br>
I understand WaW, it was fun. but nothing funny, just some crappy dark humor.</p>
<p>More like Cod 3 for Treyarch: “GET OUT OF THE WAY YOU FAT SCOTTISH TWIT!”</p>
<p>MW2 was relatively funny: " Shit’s falling from the sky, the Russians got us outnumbered, we’re screwed man, totally screwe- SHUT UP!!</p>

<p>What about the game it’s self? not the 6 years wasted on modding.</p>

            <p>Well at least Treyarch can make a fun single player.</p>
<p>I can’t see myself ever getting this. Maybe if it was a Vietnam game like rumored.</p>

            <p>I wonder if they will try to re-implement Base Assault, that’s what made United Offensive so addicting, although I can only see them attempting at it, and failing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t say that Treyarch sucks. While I’ll admit CoD3 was a pretty crappy game, WaW was actually quite good.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve noticed about Treyarch’s Call of Duty games - they try new things. CoD3 - They attempted ‘melee events’, context sensitive moments - like setting the fuses on a satchel charge. I think they also tried implementing ragdolls. Also, CoD3 was the first game to have the ability to throw grenades back. I would add that they added controllable vehicles, but I remember CoD2 had two tank levels.</p>
<p>WaW had co-op campaign, dismemberment, yes, Nazi Zombies - although I don’t really consider that an ‘innovation’.</p>
<p>So, while Infinity Ward is more consistent, Treyarch tries new things in their games. They might not always work, but at least they try.</p>

<p>too bad call of duty is the most un-original game to ever exist.</p>
