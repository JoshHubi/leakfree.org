This wonderful idea was suggested in the Heroes mourning thread, but I thought it was better to start a separate discussion topic so that we have better idea of how many people are interested in participating. I&#39;ve folded several paper cranes so far and I&#39;ve added the words &quot;SAVE&quot; and &quot;HEROES&quot; on their wings, but my effort would be pointless if I&#39;m the only one who is doing this. (Ideally, the combined teamwork of our fanbase would total at least a 1000 origami cranes.)

I&#39;m not exactly sure where we should send the paper cranes and/or waffles + syrup (plus a short letter stating why you want the series to be renewed for one more season) since NBC appears to have more than one building. I also don&#39;t know if our gifts need to be addressed to a specific person and/or department within the network. Is there anyone who can offer us further assistance? (ETA: Go to post #20 for the mailing address:[url]https://boards.9thwonders.com/index.php?s=&amp;...st&amp;p=901976[/url])

Trekkies in the &#39;60s are famous for their massive letter-writing campaign which convinced NBC to renew the original Star Trek series for a 3rd season despite its poor ratings. Hopefully we&#39;ll able to pull off something similar for Heroes, although we won&#39;t have a chance in hell if there are only small number of participants. If you love the show and want to see a 5th season, please let us know that you&#39;d like to contribute and spread the word to other fans!</description>

<p>i can’t fold paper either…except into a ball. write a threatening saying you’ll bring the furry of Islam(seems to work) on them if they don’t keep it on for one more season.</p>
<p>or you can spread the word.</p>

            <p>Heroes is pretty bad.</p>
<p>Also good luck convincing them to renew a show that costs so much in special effects and whatnot if the ratings don’t make up for it.</p>
