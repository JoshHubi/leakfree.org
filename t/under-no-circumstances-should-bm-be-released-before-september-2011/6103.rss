    <title>Under no circumstances should BM be released before September 2011</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/under-no-circumstances-should-bm-be-released-before-september-2011/6103</link>
    <description>I have a PhD to finish. If you release it before September 2011, there&#39;s no chance. None. Does the dev team want that on their conscience? Me, dead in a ditch having choked to death on my own bitterness?

So whatever you do - no release before Sept &#39;11. Deal?</description>

            <p>DanO I have bad news, the most likely scenario is an August/September 2011 launch. So you’ll be dead into finals, defending your thesis, and whatever.</p>

            <p>2011 is too early. I need to get my degree and PhD thesis too. And marry. And have children. I suggest you release 2022. By that time I have everything I need educational wise, my first wife left me with our children, and I can counter my depression by replaying BMS 100 times, before marrying a former prostitute and opening a small shop at the beach near Bordeaux that sells the best god damn sandwiches ever made.</p>
<p>Please?</p>
