And guess what, Darkness 1 gore, while somewhat understated, provided a much bigger impact.</p>

<p>I picked up my phone, dialed their number, and called them.</p>
<p>As I said in my initial post, I would go to Gamestop as a last resort, but that’s irrelevant since they don’t even have the game I want. In fact, the PS3 version is not even offered for sale on their site.</p>

            <p>I’m not saying Gamestop isn’t a flawed piece of shit store that takes used games that have been through meat grinders, but to rule it out completely as an option because you’re too petty about their services is just goddamn stupid.</p>

            <p>Sometimes Gamestop has some deals, but if it has only been a couple years since release you can usually get a new copy of the game for a price less than a used copy would be at Gamestop.</p>
<p>Example: Persona 4 at gamestop, generic label, no OST, disc has more issues than an ex girlfriend: $40+ easy.</p>
<p>Persona 4 on Amazon, full proper label, in the wrapping, OST included, perfect condition disc: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shin-Megami-Tensei-Persona-Playstation-2/dp/B001C6GVI6" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">$26 and shipping.</a></p>

            <p>That’s not at all what you said before though, you just refused to go to Gamestop, which is fucking retarded. I honestly don’t think Gamestop overprices at all, most used games are dirt cheap unless they’re extremely rare.</p>
<p>Also, if you steadfastedly refuse to go to a Gamestop, then how the hell do you know if they have a copy of it?</p>

            <p>My point wasn’t that I’d refuse to go to a local Gamestop if they had a copy (guess what? They don’t.) My point was that I avoid going to Gamestop. They’re overpriced. Which doesn’t help me get a cheaper copy, does it?</p>
<p>It’s almost always a way better deal to look online.</p>

<p>I checked Ebay, <a href="http://Bestbuy.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Bestbuy.com</a> and Amazon. There were a couple used copies listed as being in “fair” condition for $25-$30ish, anything in good shape was doing over $50 on both sites. Best Buy didn’t even have any PS3 copies.</p>

            <p>I went ahead and got the Darkness 1 demo and it was waaaaaay better. Unfortunately, it looks like it’s a collector’s item now. Copies of the first game are still going for $50+ used, and upwards of $100 new. Damn.</p>

            <p>I remember being introduced to The Darkness with some game list of Top 10 most shocking or most emotional moments in gaming [COLOR=‘Black’]where you have to watch Jenny die and I was like “Holy shit.” and then I played the game and thought she was a very well done character and watching To Kill A Mockingbird with her on TV was an awesome moment.</p>

            <p>It has a similar exploratory feel to Riddick, but relies more on fast paced gunplay and the demon arms rather than any appreciable degree of stealth. What really gave the original Darkness legs was it’s strong narrative- the story was very good with some of the most well executed player punches this side of Episode Two.</p>

<p>I still find it weird that you cannot handle the controls so much that it prevents you from playing. Because even though I admit that it wasn’t the easiest game to aim in, even frustrating at some point - I sailed through just fine, even on hard.</p>

<p>I’d be happy with a port of the first one to the PC, because I have no intention of getting a PS3 or 360, and I played an hour or two of it at a friend’s and it’s fucking incredible so it’d be awesome to finally play it through.</p>

<p>PC port of the first game is sadly unlikely to happen. Starbreeze don’t look like they can be arsed. Nevertheless, I’m happy I bought it for PS3.</p>

<p>It actually does seem to be alright in the first few acts, yet inevitably goes downhill after that.</p>
<p>What pissed me off the most was that instead of keeping their promises of ‘retaining what was good about the first one’, all they did was the sad imitation of the original, as in watchTVwith Jenny/Dance with Jenny or WWI/Asylum - which are all so second-sort and cringeworthy it hurts.</p>
<p>But okay, surely we get something in return?<br>
Oh yeah -  still horrible AI, bad bosses, bland levels, executions that get old after an hour, and how many enemy types? Eh, 4. Improvements over the original for sure. And that all new lighting mechanic? It’s actually rather annoying than challenging</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and Mike Patton actual involvment. How many actual lines he had in DII? Twenty? Thirty? Nevermind the fact how half-assed his work was, hell, it’s as if DE didn’t even pay him for that.</p>

            <p>I’ve already played about an hour yesterday and I’m loving it so far. So it doesn’t have as much finesse and style as the first one, I guess. Big fucking deal, I still like this one for what it is and that’s good enough for me.</p>
<p>I wish they released the first one for PC, tho, because while I can handle your regular FPS on console just fine, for some reason I just couldn’t handle TD1’s controls on the PS3 as well as I wished, which is a shame, because I was enjoying the story and characters so far.</p>
<p>Gotta say tho, the Field of View of TD2 on PC is really bad, even though I’ve learned over time to handle bad PC FOVs without getting sick, but still…</p>
