    <title>Borderlands Quest glitch and willow tree crashing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/borderlands-quest-glitch-and-willow-tree-crashing/5850</link>
    <description>Ok, so I have a 52 siren on borderlands, and ive been playing playthrough 2.
Now, the problem is that i cant complete the mission &quot;Keep your insides inside&quot; (which is where you need to buy a shield, and turn it into the doc), and thus, cannot continue the game.

I was told to use willow tree to manually &quot;finish&quot; the quest, however, when i try opening my siren save, willowtree crashes. I&#39;ve tried willow tree on a lvl 1 soldier, and that seems to work fine.

Any help?
Oh, and btw, im playing borderlands on my steam account.

UPDATE: I just learned that if i try and go into the weapons workshop, that the save opens fine, and willowtree doesn&#39;t crash.</description>

<p>Unless it’s a really common issue, I doubt anyone here can help. I for one get a glitch where I have to find separate rifle parts.

<p>Bollocks, it just a bitch to find and the marker doesn’t locate it’s where abouts.</p>
<p>try a youtube video guide.</p>
