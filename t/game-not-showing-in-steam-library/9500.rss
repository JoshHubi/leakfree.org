            <p>Just a quick follow-up… if you have a successful install, you must completely exit Steam and restart before it will show in your library.</p>
<p>This is more than just clicking the X in the upper right corner. You must stop it from running in the background. You can either stop it from the system tray (lower right corner of windows) or just reboot your computer.</p>
<p>It should show up at the top, Black Mesa.</p>

            <p>Should be under steamapps\common\sourcemods in a dir called \BMS. IF you can’t afford the space wherever your steamapps are stored, you can make a Junction\simlink in sourcemods to wherever you extracted the game to. A little tricky, but easy to do if you set up for it right.</p>
