    <title>Making NPCs Look Scared</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/making-npcs-look-scared/14515</link>
    <description>Hello y&#39;all.
I&#39;ve been slowly chipping away at my own singleplayer map project for a little while, and it starts as you are on a tram going past a stop. However, the resonance cascade occurs and the tram suddenly stops, and the player can watch the events unfold for a little before being knocked out to continue in post-disaster state.
The only problem I&#39;m having is getting the NPCs to actually look like they&#39;re running for their lives when the monsters spawn. All they do is run around with their hands by their sides and occasionally shout. I&#39;ve placed AI Nodes around the place so they can at least navigate, sometimes they even just stand in a position waiting for a while before the headcrab gets close enough. I would really like to find out a way to get them looking more interactive with the enemy and frightened.  Otherwise, they&#39;re running chickens.

Has anyone got an idea?

Edit: I know about the facial expression option to make them [i]look [/i]scared in the face, but I&#39;m talking about body movements, cowering, screaming etc.</description>

<p>I don’t know about putting it on Workshop, but it’s easily doable by pressing one button in Faceposer. Someone more familiar with Workshop mods need to weigh in on that.</p>

<p>Managed to do the whole resonance cascade sequence (Only about 15 seconds but y’know) using scripted sequences + choreo entities for talking!</p>

<p>Thanks.<br>
I’m thinking of just doing a whole choreographed scene, or 2. But it says I have to compile it into the scenes.image file. Is this possible to do and put it on the Workshop?</p>
