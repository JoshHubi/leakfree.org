    <title>Sony Vs Anonymous</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sony-vs-anonymous/6883</link>
    <description>As you may or may not heard, Recently Sony has filed a lawsuit against Geohot, also known as George Hotz. Reasons for filing this lawsuit seem to be Geohot owning and modifying a PS3, and then uploading information on how to do it to the internet. At the same time Geohot claims to not even know SCEA and uses that as proof that he did no wrong. Not long after he left the country claiming to be on Vacation during a law suit. 

In responce to the Lawsuit a cyber group known as Anonymous has attacked Sony&#39;s servers with DDOS for the last week and have stopped.

Now I&#39;ve heard alot of excuses that there is no case, that Geohot did nothing wrong, That sony went too far, and thus Anonymous&#39;s attacks on Sony are justified.

I find all this info to be false. Though I&#39;m not here to start a flame war, I&#39;m here to share my opinion and get opinions on all of this.

So first off, I think Sony&#39;s lawsuit is justified. You can&#39;t buy 3 PS3s with out knowing theres a difference in versions. If you go into any gaming store you&#39;ll see them on the shelves for the version area you&#39;re in, such as America&#39;s model in America.

Secondly I believe there is a case. Geohot exposed Sony&#39;s technology when he posted how to modify PS3s to get a feature back that Sony disabled to prevent Piracy in their games. Sony has a right to keep their stuff secure. As does Microsoft and Nintendo. But at the same time if Geohot really wanted to Jailbreak his system, he could have done it and kept quiet about it if he had no intention to pirate games. He simply did it to do it.

I&#39;ve also heard that Sony Requested the IP addresses of the people that have visited his website. Many people think this is a step too far. It&#39;s not. As it is just for reference on who visited the website and saw the post Geohot has made. Untill they break the law Sony cannot and will not touch those that visited Geohot&#39;s site.

Now, I&#39;ve heard several different places from different people that Geohot went to. But If I&#39;m right, don&#39;t quote me on this, that it&#39;s illegal to leave the country while a lawsuit is going on. Thats concidered fleeing the country. Whether it&#39;s a vacation or not. I know he&#39;s not on house arrest. But at the same time if he leaves the country, the country has no jurisdiction anymore and need him to come back. Right now he&#39;s un touchable.

Lastly the attack by Anonymous. Are they justified? I don&#39;t believe so. They&#39;ve more acted like kids this past week as they shut down Sony&#39;s server. I don&#39;t even believe they&#39;re the true Anonymous. The True Anonymous wouldn&#39;t mess with the innocent period. Collateral or no, they wouldn&#39;t do it. They&#39;d hit in other ways first. By shutting down the servers they hurt the consumer first and Sony last. While the true Anonymous was able to knock a Security firm CEO on their ass, the fakes weren&#39;t able to budge Sony.

Thats my thoughts and opinions on the situation. Like I&#39;ve said before. I&#39;m not trying to start a flame war, I would just like thoughts and opinions. I&#39;m not a fanboy. Never have been. I play on the other consoles just as much as the PS3 and enjoy each in their own ways.</description>

While I agree with modifying your ps3 is your perogetive, I’m not so sure about helping people untrustworthy do the same thing. it’s as the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>

<p>I did not think it through far enough. You are right about the  fact that brands and patents can in fact protect individual freedom, the  freedom of enterpreneurship for instance, they can also in a way  protect the rights of customers, being a form of quality assurance. It’s  probably just me and my chronic collectivism when it comes to wealth  distribution. I will have to give it more thought.</p>

<p>For one day some fat kid behind his computer screen has affected other people’s lives for a moral cause that his group has invented. That makes him feel big. While in reality it makes him pretty fucking pathetic</p>

<p>This is false however. As Sony created the PS3 it is copy-written to Sony. Reverse engineering is copy-write infringement. Thats the same as printing a report offline that someone has already written, and then handing it in as your own. They don’t let you do that in school and in society you can be arrested for it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok, unless you don’t want to look like a 12 year old: It’s “Copyright”, the right to copy. Ok?</p>
<p>Secondly, of course people have to feed their families. I bet Sony employees barely make it through the day in the U.S. and Europe (Unlike the people actually producing the PSP for 2 $ a day, dying of heavy metal poisoning in Asia. BUT we need our cheap high-tech, so FUCK that, piracy is the problem.) What I am trying to say is: don’t start with the “feed their families” bs. WE are not the ones having trouble feeding our families, no matter how many PSPs or anythings are pirated.</p>
<p>Thirdly: everything you sell, leaves your posession. The matter it has been produced off, and all the information on it is not yours anymore. You made a deal, you exchanged money, the quotient of everything valuable in our society, for a product and knew that anyone can basically open it and mess with it. You have NO power over it anymore. In my opinion you have to shut the fuck up once you have sold something, because you got money for the product and the thoughts attached to it. You may demand that someone makes a reference to you once he or she modified it, but that is it. Imagine clothing companies would sell you pants and then complain about the fact your mother is darning them, or increasing their waist size and sue you.</p>
<p>And last but not least this whole “this is mah idea, brand bla bla bla”:<br>
NO one can “own” an idea or a word. It is the attempt of dark minds not only to get your money with shitty products but to also completely restrict you to the products they sell.</p>
<p>Ideas are fleeting, they are built on millions of ideas people had before you. Having an idea and claiming it is “all yours” is like pissing into a river screaming “THIS RIVER IS ALL MINE”. It is megalomania. You merely voiced it or materialized it and this has to be taken into account by citation. If ideas could be possessed then two people could never have the same idea in two different parts of the world independantly. But they can, and often had. Ideas are thought, they can actually match each other fully. They do not exist in the material world. You can however possess a materialization of the idea.</p>
<p>How dumb is Sony anyhow? Employ the guy, give him a job at your company those are the most creative employees, let him do something crazy like a PSP that actually encourages modding.<br>
Just another degenerated multi-billion dollar company.</p>

<p>Umm, what? Sure most of these things like attacks begin when some guy says they should do this or that, and when an amount of people agree they should do that that doesn’t mean that the person who started it will remain a leader. And I think that a very few of the collective anonymous took part in this, most of them probably don’t care. You’re giving them too much credit, you’re making them into something more amazing than they actually are.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, not at all, I’m not giving them any credit. The thing is: <span class="bbcode-b">any</span> group of people has a natural leader. Anonymous is not different, I have seen it working and it is not like what you are saying. If someone comes with an idea that is accepted, the natural leader assumes that idea and tells everyone to do that or not. Of course, if someone has a good way to deal with people, it can convince a bunch of people to do as he thinks, and then he becomes a natural leader.</p>
<p>Whether or not anonymous’ actions (as a group, not as individuals) are good or bad, that is an entirely different discussion.</p>
<p>Just so you understand the concept: one experiment was made with a bunch of people. They weren’t aware of what the experiment was about, didn’t know each other and no one was assigned a leader. They put those people on a boat and told them to go across the river as fast as they could. When they were crossing the river, there was a person that was “controlling” the other ones, a natural leader.</p>
<p>When they got to the other margin, they took this leader away and told the others to go back as fast as they could. Then another person naturally became the new leader. They took this person, told them to go across the river again, and another person became a leader. That went on and on until there was only one person left in the boat.</p>

<p>Anonymous are people who whose identity is unknown, that’s all they are. When a person decides to kill an entire school worth of children and escapes without anyone seeing him or knowing who he was, that person is still anonymous, it doesn’t matter if he’s given a catchy nickname by the media. The point still stands, anyone can be anonymous and they could do anything the want when they are one.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You are confusing the group “anonymous” and an anonymous individual. The group of anonymous is well determined as a group of people, they go to <a href="http://irc.anonops.ru" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.anonops.ru</a> and decide to take some action. There might be some group that derives from this one, I don’t know, but note that that also happens in Spiritism and my comparison makes even more sense. And Spiritism is very well determined, even being disorganized.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, like I said, people don’t follow the rules and the code like religious people do. Again, Spiritism is exactly like that.</p>
<p>It is like saying “men like women” or “Christians believe in hell”. That is generally true, despite there being <span class="bbcode-i">a lot of</span> exceptions. The same goes for any statement about the anonymous, like “anonymous are non-violent”, that is generally true although there possibly being exceptions.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I don’t use consoles much, but I’m pretty much disgusted by Sony’s actions. I despise the corporate mentality regarding both hardware and software that has evolved over the last 12 years. The notion is that rather than purchasing the actual software or hardware, you purchase the right to use it instead. People that have come to accept this fact are, in my opinion, giant pussies that have let corporations bend them over their kitchen tables and fuck them over.</p>
<p>When Windows XP came out, everyone was in upheaval. Everybody. I’ve seen those same outraged people become people like the OP who now say that it’s just the way it is. Back then this was new enough to us that we could recognize it for what it is. Unfair. Seems like a childish word to use, but isn’t it the corporations that are the one’s label what we are allowed to do with the software we purchase as ‘fair use’?</p>
<p>But as wrong as it is, we have other areas to focus our efforts on. Hardware is an area that I feel needs to come last. We need to focus on our rights as consumers on software right now, specifically DRM and copy protection that prevents legitimate users from using  their own property.</p>
