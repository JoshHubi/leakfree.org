    <description>I need your help!

After taking a year long hiatus from the game (senior years was a bitch), I decided to return, only to find I forgot most of what happened from disk one to disk 1 to the beginning of disk 4, where I am now.

Now, I know that Gongora is busy plotting and playing Tolten like a card to gain control of Uhra.  I also know that he&#39;s using Grand Staff for...something.  He took everyone&#39;s memories, and killed Lirum.  Also the immortals are from a different world and are immortal because of that, and it has to with the hall of mirrors.

But I&#39;m a bit confused.  Are there any motives I missed that we learned about within the 1-3 disk span?  Like why Gongora attacked Gohtza.  And why he needs Grand Staff.</description>
