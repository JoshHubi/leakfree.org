<blockquote>
<p>It totally was reactionary. He saw prominent people making statements about it, so he decided to chime in. And people ate it up.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You attacked his appearance and his game instead of his opinion. One which he shares with more prominent people in gaming. Don’t you dare throw around words like reactionary.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Pardo and Newell know the industry, and they’ve been movers and shakers in it long enough to know what they’re talking about. Notch has stumbled across his success mostly by mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Pardo and Newell do know the industry, but they’re not infallible just because they’ve been movers and shakers for a long time. What stuns me about this sentence, and previous posts you’ve made, is that these fellas are opining about the SAME reasonable complaints that Notch is, however you didn’t dismiss either Pardo or Newell as reactionary. I don’t know what to make of the next sentence after that. Ignoring important factors like good PR and word of mouth and saying success came to him mostly by mistake. What bollocks! Certainly, there is unpredictable success, but there is no success mostly by mistake. Did Valve and Blizzard earn their success mostly by mistake?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional news outlets can be just as dubious, but you can’t seriously be defending internet journalism right now. That’s just… crazy talk.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I didn’t come to the defence of internet journalism, there can be plenty of gobshites in that too, you made a declarative statement with no evidence given or comparisons made. That is why I attacked. If I say, “Stupid fruit flies are the worst there is because they cant fly in straight lines.”, it doesn’t make it so, it’s just throwaway declarative conjecture.</p>
<p>I want to make it clear that I’m not a Notch sycophant, I like the aesthetics of Minecraft but the game itself is not my cup of tea, but I won’t dismiss it as a “shitty game” from a “fat indie developer”, my subjective opinion is not the de facto authority on art, but niether is yours. Nobodies opinion is, ivory tower or no ivory tower. There is one undeniable fact though, and that is how important Notches success is to grassroots\independent artists. If you have the gall to attack grassroots\independent artists, you need a little bit of introspection because where the fuck do you think you are?</p>

</aside>
<p>Notches opinion, and fears, aren’t reactionary. He didn’t complain about such superficial trivialities as the Metro UI or software compatiblity, both of which are easely rectified. He comblained about Microsofts business strategy with Windows 8, and potentially, future Windows releases; The locked in, out-of-the-box Marketplace application.</p>
<p>It also puzzles me why you singled him out for attack and not Pardo or Newell, who share his fears. From appearances, you place more value in the opinion of those with more money and power than those who are less well endowed.</p>
<p>The sorry realm of “internet journalism”? Fox News and The News of the World say hi.</p>

            <p>They need to get working on CSGO for linux. Windows version runs like shit on my laptop.</p>
<p>I could adjust the GPU voltage on Linux to put the clock at 600mhz+ instead of 430mhz in Windows. It’s a 600mhz chip for fuck’s sakes, properly cooled and silent while gaming, but I want moar powar.</p>

            <p>I have the Release Preview, and I’ve been using Win8 since the Developer Preview.</p>
<p>The OS has a number of features that Win7 doesn’t have, which makes it nice (my favorite being the new Task Manager which actually comes in very useful).</p>
<p>But for the most part it is <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Windows 7 + Metro</span></span>. It runs slightly smoother, and boots up faster than 7 (on my machine) but seems to have even more problems with backwards compatibility so far. I am hoping MS will fix that.</p>
<p>The Metro part is strange, and I’ve come to not use it at all. When my PC boots, I log in using my email address (it stores your settings and login information in ‘the cloud’), then the very first Metro Tile I click on is “Desktop”, and I do my best to avoid the start screen from there on out.</p>
<p>…Of course, you can’t completely avoid using the start menu always, and I’ve gotten pretty fast at searching for files and apps in the new menu.</p>
<p>The only Metro apps I was using regularly were [b]Reader <a>/b</a>, <span class="bbcode-b">Pictures </span>(.jpg, .png, etc) and <span class="bbcode-b">Mail</span>. I’ve replaced those with Adobe, Windows Live Photos, and Outlook.</p>
<p>If Windows Store begins to hurt Valve’s market in someway, I will be inclined to switch OS’s… perhaps Valve can start work on one…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>-Windows 8 will have an app store.<br>
-Microsoft takes 30% of everything sold through the app store.<br>
-Only Metro apps will be sold through the app store.<br>
-Steam won’t be in the app store, it will be a legacy app for the app ‘Desktop’.(Yeah, desktop is an app in windows 8[/SIZE])</p>

<p>There are plenty of other features that no one else seems to notice. How about the addition of the ribbon to Windows Explorer? Having one click access to a majority of folder commands is nice. Launching a cmd shell for that folder in one click is great. No holding shift and right clicking.</p>

</aside>
<p>Nothing that Win8 is doing, such as the ribbon or the boot times can’t be done in other operating systems if those systems used those features. Also, a UI can make a big difference. Sure, you have all those nice features, but what do you do when you have a messy, ugly, non functional UI?</p>

            <p>Who has actually played with the developer preview? Is it really that bad in your opinion? I can’t accept an opinion if naysayers are going on how they THINK it looks or feels, or even information they got based on someone’s opinion.</p>
