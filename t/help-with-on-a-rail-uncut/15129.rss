    <title>Help with On A Rail Uncut</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-with-on-a-rail-uncut/15129</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t seem to get the On A Rail Uncut mod work with the legacy edition of Black Mesa (I am planning on buying the Steam version but can&#39;t afford it at the moment).

I&#39;m having some trouble loading the maps. I did not use a previous save, and tried to start from the beginning of the On A Rail chapter, but it never loads the extra maps from the mod. Even when I try to load Map bm_c2a2a1 manually, the console says the map cannot be found.

I read through the entire readme, and I followed the instructions pretty carefully, including backing up the previous files, then unzipping the On A Rail zip file from MODDB into the Black Mesa folder, and making sure it overwrites the existing files. I double-checked that the file bm_c2a2a1.bsp exists in the correct maps folder, so I can&#39;t understand why the console can&#39;t find the map.

Does anyone have any suggestions? If it helps, the console screen says in the corner &#39;Source Engine 14, Build 3943.&#39; If you had any suggestions, I&#39;d greatly appreciate that.. I was really looking forward to trying the mod, and the Surface Tension mod. Thanks

            <p>I did figure it out and got it working. Turns out that I had the Black Mesa mod accidentally installed on more than one place on my computer (probably because of when I’d moved my Steam install folder from one drive to another).  It seems I’d forgotten to delete the old one, and was trying to copy On a Rail Uncut to the wrong folder. Thanks for the help everyone, don’t have that much experience using mods!</p>
<p>Amazing work TextFAMGUY1, I can’t wait to try Surface Tension too.</p>

            <p>Pretty much the only reason I can think of the game not being able to find the map files, is that you haven’t installed them correctly. I can think of literally no other reason why this can happen. You’ve triple checked if you navigate to sourcemods/bms/maps, that for example bm_c2a2a1.bsp exists? You’re 100% sure of that?</p>

            <p>I apologise for late response. It looks like there is no installer in mod version. I am not sure what could have gone wrong. My theory is that you might have not copied every file that is required. I’m out of ideas.

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. However I am not aware of an installer that goes with this mod?  The instructions in the readme for this mod says to just copy and paste after unzipping the mod files. Doesn’t mention any installer.<br>

            <p>I think you should try installing that mod with installer. This might help, because you never know if you didn’t make accidentaly some kind of mistake during copying from zip file. If I am not mistaken, zip file can be found on modbd.</p>
