    <title>Laptop failure.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/laptop-failure/2821</link>
    <description>Lately, I&#39;ve been having problems with my old laptop.  The OS is Windows XP Home, and whenever I get on my account, the WiFi light lights up on my keyboard, even when there is no wifi around, every 3 seconds I get this message popping up saying &quot;Windows Explorer has encountered an error, Send Error Report, Don&#39;t Send.&quot;  Explorer won&#39;t crash if I leave the message box open.  I also cannot get on Internet Explorer nor Firefox without it crashing, and I can&#39;t access my Network Settings in Control panel.  Could the NIC be burned out?  What do you guys think?  I do plan on installing Knoppix on it this weekend.  I think the first mistake was buying a Dell. :|</description>

            <p>Thanks for the help guys, I think I’m just going to format.  As for doing a system restore, I’ve already tried that, doesn’t work.</p>

            <p>Sounds like you fucked with windows a little too much. Formatting completely would probably help. It doesn’t exactly sound like a hardware issue, so doing a clean install would be a good idea IMO.</p>

            <p>Laptops are not immortal, at the very least install XP professional on it.</p>
<p>Eventually you might have to replace your hard drive or RAM.</p>

            <p>Try a Linux Live CD, if it still has this problem it’s probably a hardware failure, if not than it might just be something with Windows.</p>
