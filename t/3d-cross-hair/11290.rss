    <title>3D cross hair</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/3d-cross-hair/11290</link>
    <description>Does anyone know how to get the 3D crosshair working. I have to turn 3D off to fight enemies because the crosshair is doubled (one for each eye. Every other game works fine with the 3D crosshair but its not a Black Mesa issue its a half-life or source issue. Also can someone explain the setup options for Black Mesa. Like whats Houndeye tinnitus? The hound eyes have a ring in their ears? also the specific settings for black Mesa if they could be explained. Some are obvious such as Muzzle flash but I would love to know what the others are for. Batter Dlight? Train failsafe? etc. Thanks.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Actually I noticed the Hive Hand has its own 3D cross hair that works well - I wonder if Valve developed (or tried to) their own 3D crosshair and the rocket launcher works well obviously because it has the laser sight. When I said HL2 works well in 3D I meant most times indoor and outdoor no problem but when you get those massive Vistas like stepping out over the Canyon from the waste water pipe, distant mountains are way out of whack. I had to turn off motion blur as well otherwise an image was frozen in my left lens. Has anyone noticed on the Computer screens with the BSOD they have two changes 1. BMOS obviously Blackmesa have their own purpose built stations although what can replace Complimentary? and is that a nod to Mario? with an obviously misspelt word? I mean this game has been tested thoroughly no doubt so the BSOD mistakes have to be on purpose! I suppose it woudnt be a surprise with so many games giving a nod to half-life they decided an earlier reference to gaming was apt.</p>

<p>Thanks - that’s such an obvious explanation, I should’ve known…</p>
<p>Also, linking to the wiki page would’ve been the easier (and probably the better) way - oh, well.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>OK, Thank you for both your replies. All is clear now and FYI, Half-life 2 BM etc plays perfectly in 3D unlike a lot of newer games that just look terrible with all the special fog and special effects. In nvidia’s games compatibility list it says Half-life2 good and stereoscopic, In other words the 3D aspect is good out of 3D vision ready, Excellent, , good, fair or not recommended. Although I would have put it at Excellent and stereoscopic meaning the 3D cross hair issue. Which is a shame although I guess its just like playing without a crosshair, more challengeing.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">About the commands &amp; settings in the “Black Mesa” options menu:</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Gameplay</span></span></p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Creature Gib</span>” = Enables gibbing / splatter effects for humans and aliens alike.</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Always Run</span>” = Running (sprinting) is always enabled (as if you pressed and held down the SHIFT key / the key you bound sprinting to).</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Train Fail-Safe</span>” = When using trains (or trams) and you fall off, the train stops - if the option is not checked, the train keeps moving away, until it is forced to stop, by an obstacle.</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Houndeye Tinnitus</span>” = When checked it adds a short (audible) deafening effect, whenever a Houndeye uses its blast in close proximity (no ringing).</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Auto-Aim</span>” = Automatically ‘snaps’ onto a target, helping you aim (useful for gamepads).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note (Auto-Aim):</span> Checking or unchecking this option does not seem to have an effect, yet.</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Weapon Fast Switch</span>” = Allows you to ‘fast switch’ your weapons, by pressing their corresponding keys, instead of opening the weapon category (Assault, Melee) first and then selecting the wanted weapon.</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Iron-Sight</span>” = Enable the Iron-Sights for both the .357 Magnum and the Crossbow (Zoom).</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Iron-Sight Sticky</span>” = Defines if the Iron-Sights should be activated using toggle (press the key once) or hold (press and hold the key down).</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Disable View Bob</span>” = Similiar to View Roll, it determines the intensity of the <span class="bbcode-u">up-down</span> ‘shaking’, not View Roll (left and right).</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">View Roll</span>” = When walking or running, the camera moves left and right, to simulate a more realistic effect.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Performance</span></span></p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable DLight Manager</span>” =  Automatically detects spikes in dynamic lighting that cause performance drops and disables lightmap updating in those areas temporarily to improve framerates. (Source: Quoted from <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Main_Menu#Gameplay" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the Wiki</a>)</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable MuzzleFlash DLight</span>” = Probably affects special lighting effects, when shooting.</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Battery DLight</span>” = Batterys emit light / act like light sources, lightening up their close environment.</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Gluon Burn-Trail</span>” = When checked, the Gluon Gun leaves a burn trail (decals) behind, wherever the trail hits (screenshot below).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Gluon Burn-Trail (Screenshot):</span></p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Visual</span></span></p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Chromatic Aberration</span>” = A screen-wide effect for several occasions (see below for reference).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chromatic Aberration (Reference):</span><br>
(Source: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Chromatic_aberration_%28comparison%29_-_enlargement.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Chromatic_aberration_%28comparison%29_-_enlargement.jpg</a>)[/SIZE]</p>

<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable Noise Shader</span>” = Enables or disables the grainy overlay effect, whenever the player is close enough to radioactive material.</p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">Enable HUD Post Process</span>” = Enables HUD post processing effects (screenshot below).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">HUD Post Processing (Screenshot):</span></p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-i">HUD Bloom</span>” = Certain areas of the HUD ‘flash’ in different situations (when hit, reloading, ecetera).</p>
<hr>
<p>That is about the best explanation I can give you, testing all the settings in game would be the better way to determine what each of the settings does.</p>
<p>These explanations could all be wrong, so please - if you know what they ‘really’ do or just want to add something, reply below.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Houndeye Tinnitus makes the ear ringing sound when they attack.<br>
Battery Dlight allows suit batteries to emit their own light in dark areas.<br>
Train failsafe is an automatic brake on the tram when the player moves a certain distance away from it.<br>
afaik, Black Mesa was never intended to be played in 3D, so you’re going to find little help for it here.</p>
