    <title>My Mass Effect inspired song</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-mass-effect-inspired-song/4221</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make music that would fit in video games because I would like to contribute my music to the modding community. 
Enjoy and let me know what you think. If you could see this being used in the actual game or a mod, please say so. :3
Its only a minute long at the moment. I plan to add more to it, but its coming slowly.
