    <description>Hi!

I just sat and went through some prison break episodes (once again) and when this girl in episode s01e17 starts to talk @ about 08 : 30, I cant help to think that she&#39;s the exact same voice as Mossman in half-life 2.

Someone else noticed this?
Can someone dig up if it really is her, or do they just sound just alike?

If you can&#39;t watch the episode.

            <p>:fffuuu:</p>
<p>I just realised something!<br>
I was watching a star trek episode yesterday (it was called Half A Life) and the name “Michelle Forbes” came up on the screen and I thought “hmm, that sounds familiar” and your post made me realise that it was <span class="bbcode-i">Doctor Mossman on star trek</span>!</p>
<p>(and she went on to play Ensign Ro later)</p>
