It’s been my experience that people who smoke weed either grow it themselves or buy it from a friend who does.

<p>Uhh, no. I doubt that. If he’s making 230,000 a year then he’s making a LOT of money and far more than he needs to support a family of 4. So either he’s blowing it all on drugs or he doesn’t really make 230,000 a year.</p>

<p>Just because it’s been classed illegal it’s a BAD thing, as far as I’M aware, it’s because it’s so easy to produce/sell the government have no way of making money from it, so simple, they make it illegal and charge the people they catch selling it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, moderating the use and growth of it (like an alcohol/firearms license but for growing weed) would be best. You get caught, you get fined. Simple enough.</p>
<p>I’m not ‘pro’ weed at all, never tried it, never will. But I’ve always had the stance: “You want to do it go right ahead, just leave me out of it.”</p>
<p>It just pisses me off with the annoying dumbasses who don’t have the slightest clue what they’re talking about and call it WORSE than tobacco. They have no concrete proof and they just want to ‘protect’ the nations youth. In reality, <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span> of man power and currency is wasted on trying to control it, while quite a lot of people make money off of it (if they don’t grow it themselves, they need to go to a distributor, sometimes that distributor could be a batch of very bad people).</p>
<p>The stupidest shit that I’ve seen is the 1920’s prohibition inside of the United States. This stuff still exists, it’s just with drugs. While some shit can really fuck you up <em>cough</em> meth <em>cough</em>. The legalization of the growth and sale of cannabis and some of the ‘safer’ drugs would likely harm the drug cartels that are trying to make the cash off of it more than the efforts from countries around the world trying to moderate and stop it at their boarders, and will likely cause an influx of some cash back into the rotting economies of some of the more developed countries. I see nothing wrong with people using it to unwind, but it needs to be moderated else the situation could get out of control.</p>

<p>My humble opinion:<br>
Weed makes people lazy and apathetic. It degrades society and should be avoided and destroyed. Of course, all in moderation may apply, but it’s easiest just to keep away from it than attempt to moderate your consumption. And yes these are generalizations, they aren’t true for a lot of people possibly including you, but for the majority they are.</p>
<p>I have never smoked weed myself, but I live in a town that takes stoner culture to an absurd extreme. I hate it.</p>
<p>My advice: leave that male plant there. And try to get a hold of more of them if you can and start planting them everywhere. Fuck over the local growers, they deserve it.</p>

<p>Lazy and apathetic?  I smoke daily and have kids, own a house and make 65,000 a year.  For someone who has never tried it you seem to have pretty totalitarian opinions in the matter.</p>

<p>You can just tell that’s male straight off. (past experience off growing five plants, all with proper equipment.) (non-profit btw.)</p>
<p>To be honest the stuff is smoked by everyone from all ages here, less psychological and physical damage, as compared to the ever so right and completely legal fine alcohol, right?</p>
<p>as long as you don’t have copious amounts they will just confiscate it if they really want to, even then that’s pretty much the harshest punishment here, you can probably get away with it 4/5 times before they decide to fine you, then jail/fine if your taking the piss.</p>
<p>Just because it’s been classed illegal it’s a BAD thing, as far as I’M aware, it’s because it’s so easy to produce/sell the government have no way of making money from it, so simple, they make it illegal and charge the people they catch selling it.</p>

            <p>Of the 6 times I used it, there was only one time I felt funny and had more than my fair share of laughter. 2 times I felt horny (out of which only 1 time I actually got to fuck), and 3 times I felt dizzy and tired.</p>
<p>This isn’t worth the effort of getting the stuff.</p>

            <p>I know people that have tried it and are fine, and a couple of people that were heavy users and have had frightening personality changes (this was very excessive use). But a heavy drinker will become a different person, so I guess it’s all swings and roundabouts. Personally I’ve never seen the attraction but I try not to judge.</p>
<p>However, if you can truly call yourself a mature adult (as many of you do when you’re calling a fellow poster a 12-year old) you would never, ever recommend or encourage a minor to try it. I enjoy my drinking sessions as much as the next man, but despite being asked several times I’ll never buy alcohol for a minor. What’s fine for an adult isn’t good for younger people, whatever they may think. Inevitably they’ll try their own stuff and make their own mistakes, which is part of growing up, but balanced advice is better than impressing your own views on them</p>
