    <title>Another problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/another-problem/213</link>
    <description>This is really annoying me now, iv&#39;e searched the internet for a solution, but i&#39;d like some help directed at my problem.

Basically when I run my map it sets mat_fullbright to 1, but won&#39;t let me set it to 0. 
In the dev console it says;

Level unlit, setting &#39;mat_fullbright 1&#39;

On the Valve developer community it states that their is probably a leak when this problem arises. I also inspected my compile log

**** leaked ****
Entity info_player_counterterrorist (-1152.00 -1056.00 201.00) leaked!

Which obviously leads to believe me that I have a leak, but the thing that annoys me is that I added very little to my level since I last compiled it(about 5 minutes before) and nothing which could have caused a leak.

Can anybody help me, or is more information required.</description>

            <p>Ill just double post before I close the thread, thanks to everybody who helped. The problem was the skybox tied to the entity thing. Now I can continue with my map.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>Edit: Well I don’t seem to be able to close it. Ah whatever.</p>

</aside>
<p>They appear to be tied to func detail. I don’t know if that’s ok or not, and I can’t remember doing it. Could that be the problem?</p>
<p>Thanks Mangled for the piece of advice, I’ll provide a 3d screenshot if the skybox thing doesn’t fix the map.</p>
<p>Edit: I don’t think It can be that,  in my previous version of the map the skybox was also a func_detail. This is really starting to annnoy me, I just wish I understood the cause.</p>
<p>Edit: I just relised the previous version is leaked too(even though I was playing yesterday with no problems, i’ll go back to an earlier version.</p>
<p>Edit again: It seems that all versions are leaked, which is really weird.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Encasing your map inside a solid brush wouldn’t help. Hollowing a brush just makes it into 6 brushes anyway and whilst it’s easy, it isn’t good practice.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Manually build your skybox around your map by making ‘walls’, a ‘floor’ and a ‘ceiling’ from brushes. Make sure all the edges are flush with eachother on the grid.</span></p>
<p>Would you be able to provide a screenshot from the 3D view of your map? It may help in solving what it wrong here.</p>

            <p>I encased the map in a nodraw brush to seal any leaks that were possible. It fixed nothing.</p>
<p>Mangled : There was nothing wrong with the skybox before in the previous compile, most tutorials which I have come across show the skybox as one hollow brush.</p>

            <p>Have you made your skybox correctly? The skybox should be 6 brushes that form a cube around your map, not 1 brush that contains your map.</p>
<p>My advice is to remake your skybox.</p>

            <p>Ok, done. Unfortunatly the pointfile just starts(or ends…?) at the info_decal and goes a little through the map, past the skybox brush and slightly into the void. Could anyone explain that to me.</p>

            <p>It’s probably just referencing the closest entity to the leak.  <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Hammer_Map_Menu#Load_Pointfile" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Load the pointfile</a> and look at the red line.</p>

            <p>As I said, I have added very little and the previous compile worked fine. I could have maybe placed an entity outside the map by accident. I’ll check now.</p>
<p>Edit: I deleted every counter terrorist spawn on the map, now it says the same thing but with terrorists.</p>
<p>Edit: ‘Entity infodecal (-1080.00 441.15 99.55) leaked!’ Wow, this is just a great day, any explainations anyone?</p>

            <p>I can’t possibly see how the void could have got in though, the entire map has been encased in a skybox.</p>
<p>Also their wasn’t a leak in the previous compile. And all I added since was an extra brush over half of the walls of a room.</p>
