    <title>How did Eli and Kleiner get to Eastern Europe?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-did-eli-and-kleiner-get-to-eastern-europe/6802</link>
    <description>Somebody in the HL vs. HL2 thread brought this up, and I realize that it was never explained in game.

I hope I don&#39;t sound stupid asking the question, but I&#39;ve read pretty much the entire &quot;Combine Overwiki&quot; (Half Life wiki) and don&#39;t recall anything regarding that.

So, how [i]did[/i] Eli and Kleiner get to Bulgaria or wherever Half Life 2 is set in?</description>

<p>Like many things in the hl universe, we like to reserve these things until we can make some use of them. There’s no point in carving a story idea in granite, only to get there and learn that it leads to bad, boring gameplay.</p>
<p>I hope mod makers don’t spend too much time worrying about whether they’re in conflict with half-life. If they get something “wrong”, we won’t change what we decide to do because of it. They can, if they want, show eli losing his leg to a bullsquid while helping kleiner get to safety in black mesa; but if i have an opportunity to later show eli losing his leg while helping kleiner get into city 17, i’ll go ahead and do that. I’m not out to spoil the fans’ fun!</p>
<p>Perhaps there are many many parallel universes, in each of which eli loses his leg in an entirely different way.</p>

            <p>I wonder if that rocket silo was a relic of the cold war…</p>
<p>they could have gone to eastertn europe, because they needed rocket silos to stop<br>
the portal storms and they knew/suspected, that there could be / are several of those<br>
rocket silos in eastern europe, because of the cold war.</p>
<p>perhaps it helps that we keep in mind,<br>
that gman took alyx from black mesa (ep2 gman monologue),<br>
that barney, (if bs is cannon, is it ? idk…) actually made it out of bmrf by car (see bs ending),<br>
and that elis and klieners way of escape is unknown.<br>
magnusson made it to eastern europe too.<br>
so did mossman.</p>
<p>all those guys are in europe now.<br>
i think this is either the relocation by combine<br>
or the gman has intervened somewhere</p>

            <p>I don’t think Eli and Kleiner were relocated.</p>
<p>Here’s what I think: They already knew how was Breen before the invasion. When he ascendend to “supervisor” (I don’t clearly remember), both of them already knew what was happening, and looked for a place that, in first instance, had the same infrastructure as Black Mesa - mainly, White Forest (a missle silo), and more places as satellite laboratories (Black Mesa East, as a chief one, and Kleiner’s lab, so that if one laboratory was invaded, there were more doing the research). Why Eastern Europe? I don’t know. Perhaps they were in a hurry to find a place, and perhaps BM had connections with some people there.</p>

            <p>Don’t screw up my thread, people.</p>
<p>I also think that Isaac, Eli, Barney, and Gordon were all friends. It would make sense. We know that Gordon and Barney were, and also that Isaac oversaw Gordon getting his PhD and all that. Eli and Isaac probably stuck together even if they didn’t know each other before (which they most certainly did), because Eli was taking care of Isaac when he got hurt in the Resonance Cascade.</p>

<p>Actually I read somewhere that while the Gearbox games aren’t canon, the fact that a nuclear detonation destroyed Black Mesa is canon.</p>
<p>(And I’d like to point out that not even the events of HL1 is canon, as the adventures Barney is hinting at in the HL2 universe is most probably the combined memories of all the barnies who escorted you on a section or two in HL1. Just like Kleiner, Eli and Magnusson are the combination of their respective classes of characters: the bald scientist, the african american scientist and the scientist with the hairline. Although you could pinpoint which exact character they represent from HL1, but I’m positive that the nostalgic feeling when Kleiner first appears on the screen in HL2 is only there because all those many clones of him in HL1 and not the two-senctence guy only in the Anomalous Materials Lab.)</p>

<p>Seeing as how Kliener and Eli both came from the same place, it would not be crazy to assume that they were relocated to the same one for efficency. What I want to know is how Eli and Kleiner got out of Black Mesa before the nuke detonated. Or without getting slaugtered by the Aliens, Marines, or Black Ops.</p>

<p>Well my brother told me (so it could be false) that valve disowned the Opposing Force story line because it didn’t flow with the storyline they wanted to make. I think they only let gearbox make blue shift and opposing force for extra money and to keep half life somewhat relevant during the long break between the first game and half-life2.</p>
