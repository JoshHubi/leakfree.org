    <title>What are you looking forward to this year?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-are-you-looking-forward-to-this-year/6291</link>
    <description>I was just reading [url=&#39;https://movies.ign.com/articles/114/1142532p1.html&#39;]this article[/url] about some movies coming out this year, and while there&#39;s plenty I have no desire to watch, there&#39;s also a lot that look awesome, or at least fun. So I just thought I&#39;d see what other people are anticipating.

What are [b]you[/b] looking forward to this year? What movies are you pumped for? What games are coming out that you can&#39;t wait to get your hands on?

For me:

After watching the trailer for Battle: Los Angeles, I gotta say I really want to see it. Super 8, being a J.J. Abrams flick, deserves at least one viewing. Hoping for more Star Trek than Cloverfield. Cowboys and Aliens...Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are gonna make me go see it. It&#39;s a strange premise but I&#39;ve seen stranger turn out great. I&#39;m also cautiously optimistic about Transformers, Pirates, and X-Men. I&#39;m hoping they can turn their franchises around from their previous entries, but I&#39;m prepared for disappointment. Thor, Drive, Source Code, and Apollo 18...will wait for reviews.

Games wise, Portal 2 is almost here, and then I can&#39;t think of anything until ME3 and Skyrim in holiday season. Here&#39;s hoping we get some surprise releases this year too *wink wink nudge nudge*</description>
