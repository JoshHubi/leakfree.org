    <title>Accessing the BM 3D models</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/accessing-the-bm-3d-models/12889</link>
    <description>Hello

We are producing the second part of our Half-Life fan film and are looking for a high quality 3D model and texture of a head crab.  

I figured instead of making one from scratch we could pull one from the game. 

I have searched around on how to do that, and I have seen videos online of rendered models composited into video but I am coming up short on exactly how to do it. 

Can anyone point me to a tutorial on ripping the models from the client?

thanks

            <p>It’s made out of a few models.<br>

<p>All the albedos, normals and specs are included, filesize is a bit harsh as I opted to go for TGAs, since some of Source’s VTF formats compress and cause artifacts in enough textures as it is.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I was able to extract and model.</p>
<p>Its hard to know where the content is.  Is there reference anywhere?  There doesn’t seem to be any mention of AMS or test chamber.</p>

            <p>Use a program called Crowbar, it’s incredibly simple and practically self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Also, sorry, I forgot to get the files for you. I’ll get on that as soon as I get home from work.</p>

            <p>I have the first part of this process complete.</p>
<p>I am struggling when it comes to decompiling the files.</p>
<p>Does anyone have instructions for this? Tutorials online seem to be unspecific.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Looking for the AMS and external buildings to use as a starting point.</p>

<p>Yes, it should be more or less the same deal.

            <p>So does anyone here know how would i go about ripping the model of the AMS to use in this film?</p>
<p>Same method as above?</p>
<p>you can see how seriously I am taking this project here:</p>

            <p>Probably for the best. Creating one yourself will likely lead to a higher- quality model since you aren’t restricted by the game engine’s limits.</p>

            <p>You’ll have to create one yourself. The viewmodel Tau Cannon is missing a lot of polygons, because those polygons were never to be seen in game either way, and the worldmodel Tau Cannon is so low poly you would definitely not want to use it in any kind of film.</p>

            <p>I’m an animator, but only on the animation side of things.  I do know that it’s not as simple as getting a model into the program.  You need to be able to have the move and deform, even it’s as simple as moving a leg.  That needs a rig of some sort (a skeleton, perhaps, that you can grab and with which to move things around).  Then, once it’s all rigged up, then you can start animating.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>It’s gonna be a bit more complicated than simply pulling the model from the game. I’m not an animator/3D artist/video editor so I can’t say how you’d go about animating and getting the shots you need or whatever, but I can tell you how to get to that point.</p>
<p>The headcrab in Black Mesa is borrowed from Half-Life 2. You’ll need to extract the model’s files (using a program called GCFScape) from the Source SDK Base 2007.gcf (located in your <span class="bbcode-i">steam\steamapps</span> (or if you have the Steampipe update, the hl2_misc_dir.vpk which is in <span class="bbcode-i">steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2\hl2</span>) directory). The model you will need is “models\headcrab.blah.blah” (get all 7 files). The texture you will need is in “materials\models\headcrab” (get the VTF).</p>
<p>Then you’ll need to open and export the VTF using a program called VTFEdit so that it’ll be a conventional image file (.tga, jpg, png, etc.).</p>
<p>You will then need to decompile the model using a program called StudioMDL so that it may be used in a 3D modeling package. From there, I guess it’s just a matter of animating it, rendering that then compositing that into your shots as needed.</p>
