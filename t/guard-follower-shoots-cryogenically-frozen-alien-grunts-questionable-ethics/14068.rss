    <title>Guard (follower) shoots cryogenically frozen Alien Grunts. (Questionable Ethics)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/guard-follower-shoots-cryogenically-frozen-alien-grunts-questionable-ethics/14068</link>
    <description>I was playing through Questionable Ethics and got the guard to follow me. I went into B04-Cryogenics and told him to wait outside. However, he came into the room with me and started to shoot the tanks holding the Alien Grunts.
I&#39;m sure these grunts are only meant to be fought if you choose to (or accidentally) set off the bombs, and not be shot at beforehand by NPCs.
