    <description>Hey guys.

My band just did a song about Half Life.

And we made fun of the &quot;are video games art&quot; debate in the video.

            <p>song is okay, but not the kind that you want to keep listening it for few more times</p>
<p>There should be some rest in the lyric as it sound awkward to me to listen.</p>

            <p>It allways amazes me how “musicians” feel so butthurt by every singel critique they get. Get over yoursel! I’ve played metal for 20+ years. I’ve got as many plus as I get minus. But you know my band actually play instruments…that means actually PLAYING not not sequencing, and or sampling and “rince-repeat”. Sorry to burst your buble but that’s it. basically.</p>
<p>oh…and having that really little girl playing that big bass…thinking it’s the least important instrument…FAIL. You can’t just dress her up and think “now we are on something…”<br>
That melody has been sung a thousand times btw…Sorry</p>

            <p>The song isn’t about Gordon Freeman.  It’s about a guy who keeps getting in trouble and wishing that Gordon Freeman would swoop in and save him.</p>
<p>In the end, Freeman shows up and saves the guy from death.  That’s what the end part is about.</p>

            <p>Okay well first off I’ll say that I like the chorus except for the very end bit about grabbing a gun and fucking killing them, or something like that.</p>
<p>The chorus has the best consistency in the song I think. I found the moments that shifted to a more up-tempo theme to be a little jarring as at those times I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to be feeling.<br>
I think maybe you were trying to inject a little optimism into Gordon’s fight, but it felt more like I couldn’t take his fight seriously.</p>
<p>Hope you’re not offended so far, I’m just giving you my raw reaction.<br>
Everything after 3:25 should be cut imho.<br>
As far as the in game video is concerned I think we would have benefited more from not seeing Gordon in action until the last rendition of the chorus. Everything before that I think should have been slow-mo pans of NPC and creature fights or visuals of iconic locations.<br>
That way it’s sort of a build up to Gordon answering the page.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>As far as your band’s appearance (and this might be asking too much from a technical perspective) it would have been nicer to see you guys in the actual shots, where the extreme stillness wouldn’t have been as noticeable.</p>
<p>Don’t take this personally though, the only musical talent I have is that I whistle really well. I can tell you put a lot of work into the editing and production.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
