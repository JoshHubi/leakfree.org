    <description>I Think they didn&#39;t make a good appearance in Black Mesa, even though the design is good but they don&#39;t seem to act as The Assault Troops they should have been, you rarely fight them Black Mesa, they make a small appearance in Questionable Ethics and Don&#39;t appear that much in the rest of the chapters, even in Lambda Core we fought more Vort&#39;s then we fought Grunts. 

I noticed that they&#39;re Hivehands are better then the ones with Gordon, they have much more ammo then our Hivehands which is odd, maybe Gordon&#39;s Hivehand isn&#39;t like the Grunts Hivehand because Gordon&#39;s Hivehand is damaged.

I think they should be much more like the Human Grunts, appearing much more, in numbers, and act like a team. I hope that the First Update in Black Mesa would hopefully fix these problems</description>

<p>If you feel as though the alien grunts did not appear enough in black mesa then I would say you should take a look at what he has done. His maps make it look like the military and the alien grunts are locked in a war. He uses the grunts to their full potential.</p>

<p>I think if i was a hivehand I would also be damaged  and in a sorely bad mood if some human male with fairly large hands shoved his hand up my ass with no lube. So excuse that poor little hivehand for not wanting to squeeze out a few more bees. Poor little lad.</p>

<p>I dont like how you can just crowbar them to dead and not take any damage</p>

<p>It was the same in Half Life as well unfortunately.</p>
<p>You can also do this “attack and don’t take damage” thing on Ichthyosaurs if you’re brave enough.<br>
I’m unsure if it’s a problem with the Black Mesa models, or if it’s an inherent problem with source. Oh well. -shrug-<br>
The main difference is in Half Life, the hivehand on them kind of sucked so you had the opportunity to run up and smack them. Now it’s a lot more effective, so you usually keep your range.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that doesn’t only happen with the crowbar. I was replaying Black Mesa just yesterday (I was starting Lambda Core), and an Alien Grunt was within probably arms reach of me, and shooting them with the MP5 seems to also make them not attack you, they “stutter-animate” as I call it.</p>

            <p>I liked them, they were a lot tougher than in HL so less face-to-face combat makes sense. I think there were too many vorts popping up at regular intervals, which seemed a bit like whack-a-mole, but overall the power of the enemies was quite well balanced, except the Itcthyosaur!</p>

            <p>I have always imagined that they shouldn’t really be called alien grunts, but more like “Alien Elites.”  The vortiguants are more like grunts in BMS.</p>
