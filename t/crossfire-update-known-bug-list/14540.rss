    <title>Crossfire Update - Known Bug List</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crossfire-update-known-bug-list/14540</link>
    <description>The original thread for the update notes is too long, so I&#39;ve created this thread.

KNOWN ISSUES:
* Server ranks lists players as un-named
* Snarks are floating on Crossfire
* Players can pass through some barrels in Crossfire
* Flash effect applies to people in bunker of Crossfire
* Crossbow sound effect have horrible screeching sound (link on how to fix that coming soon)
* Turning off muzzle flashes does not work (fix coming in next patch)
* Tau is overpowered - One of the devs turned it up for development stuff. Values didn&#39;t get reverted.
* Tow launcher aim get screwed up if you step to close
* Crossbow may float in some single player maps
* Game may build .ain files when changing levels - This may be due to
* Collision is on teammates in TDM
* [s]Closed Captions May not be working[/s]- Please see workaround for Closed Caption Enabling [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28692-WORKAROUND-How-to-enable-supported-Closed-Captions/?postID=615762#post615762&#39;]here.[/url] They do work! Need to add a UI element for selecting them.
* [s]Fix UGC workshop Publish tool so that it can actually launch.[/s] It launches now, and you can upload mods, but they are placed into SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890 when you subscribe to them - Copy/pasting the contents over to black_mesa/bms/addons and putting them in a folder that is named the mods title, should allow them work.
* Lag is being reported on some maps, but not others. It&#39;s being reported that it is tied into either weapons spawning, or players spawning. We have yet to determine which one it is, or if it&#39;s both, or if it&#39;s neither.
* Crash bug on Silo 2 of Blast pit when loading a map. (If you are spawning into the map in the void, then you probably have the DLight Blastpit mod, or had it at some point and the files didn&#39;t get properly replaced. Remove the mod, and verify your game client files. This might not be related to the Crash bug. If you are getting the crash bug, but have NEVER installed the DLight bug, or anything else like that, please let us know!)


We are currently and actively updating this list.</description>

<p>did 1,2,3,4 but i learned that  the workshop doesn’t actually delete the mods and they just stay on the Computer i am guessing when i tested WGH vent mod  to see what the differences was that kept it saved to disk as i had exited BMS and boom crossfire update i am guessing that the workshop changes affected if mods are deleted only reason i noticed this was a glock re animation mod</p>

<p>Check the public beta branch, I believe we’ve commited SOME changes there. These are changes that we were either already working on, or deemed high enough priority to push through quickly. There are still many bugs we’re working on at the moment.</p>

<p>The same happened to me when using a pre-update save of “Questionable Ethics”.<br>
Restarting and just starting a new chapter fixed the issue, I think it´s just corrupted old save files.</p>

<p>The players can pick up a weapons through a walls…</p>
<p>it should be fixed</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s actually been a problem from before this update.  There doesn’t seem to be a line-of-sight test when you pick up items, only distance, so you can actually grab items through walls if the wall is thin enough.  Case in point, the Shotgun in Bravado could be acquired by just rubbing against the wall to the right of the door.  It was fixed by having the Shotgun spawn only once the player drops down into the room.  This doesn’t happen in HL2.</p>

<li>
<p>They said they are working on making the movement more HL1-like (multiple times). Since they unlocked movement variables I’m sure they are working on it (for real). So I just wanted to give some simple information on how they should make it (I know they never comment on these kind of info, but still it might help them).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use-key slowdown is noted on their changelog for the crossfire update and it does not work for me (so it is a bug)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zoom-Scala doesn’t work correctly (it must be a bug)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk functionality is on sprint key while there is a walk button in keyboard option aswell (might not be a bug but still it doesn’t make much sense)</p>

            <p>Also the slider for zoom-sensitivity has wrong values on it’s scala in Black Mesa options. I had zoom-sensitivity on 1.0 (according to the scala in BM options) but in the end it was like 0.5 in game. Then I set it to 2.0 (according to the scala) in BM options and it was like 1.0 in game.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Thank you so much for reverting the charger charge-times. I’m sure it adds a lot teamplay-value to the game. On the other hand… It would be cool if item respawn times where uniform just like in HL1 (Items = 30 sec, Weapons and Ammo = 20 sec).<br>
Another idea I had which could balance egon (since it’s just very easy to use and it is and should be very powerful) is to make it respawn like the Quad-Damage from Quake (Only have 1 Egon spawn per map. Egon should only spawn all 2 minutes and it should not be available right on map start. It could come with 60 ammo on pickup).</p>

            <p>Not really a bug, but still:<br>
Weapon sway and godrays should have sliders in the options menu.<br>
I hope the current one is a placeholder, because having an extra “Black Mesa” tab with some graphics options, other trivial stuff and 2 different fast switch option is just confusing.</p>

<p>KNOWN ISSUES:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collision is on teammates in TDM</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s not a problem. I hope it will stay in the game as a feature (optional maybe). I never had any problems with teammates blocking me in HLDM or AG. In my opinion the game is way too fast go get blocked by others. Not sure if you devs changed the run speed for current BM version, but maybe slow down run speed slightly and increase walk speed a slight bit aswell.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
I installed New Gauge Half-Life (HL1 Mod) to check movement speed values for walk and normal run. The normal run is 300 ups in all directions. The walk is 120 ups in all directions. In HL1 you can gain additional speed by curve-movements or by quickly tapping strafe left and right keys while running forward or backward (I guess you should really check how movement works in HL1 source code… Or maybe check Quake 1 sourcecode if that’s simpler… Movement just seems to work quite different compared to Source 2013, since there aren’t any speedcaps and directional movement speeds can overlap eachother)… When you hold walk and move in a circle in HL1DM you can gain a lot of speed because of overlapping movements… Using this technique you can reach almost 240 ups. Your player stays silent as long as you move slower than ~230 ups. Footstep sounds are not dependent on what keys you press. It depends on if you are on the ground and on how much ups you have.<br>
Also please check why holding use-key doesn’t work in current Black Mesa Multiplayer version (maybe it’s a bug for me or it’s not yet implemented)…<br>
I would also welcome a working walk-key, since sprint key should be for sprinting only. Please make walk a seperate key in keyboard options so that it can be used in single- and multiplayer.</p>

            <p>Hi! I need to notice this, but sometimes Tau Wallshoting doesn’t work and, if it works, it’s not like HL1DM (This last point I understand, this is WIP). Anyway, I think Tau Jumping height has been reduced again. That’s all at the moment.</p>
<p>Thanks ^^</p>

<ul>
<li>Lag is being reported on some maps, but not others. It’s being reported that it is tied into either weapons spawning, or players spawning. We have yet to determine which one it is, or if it’s both, or if it’s neither.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve created a map pack that includes affected &amp; non affected maps by this problem + indications on how to test so you see what we see.</p>
<p>I am not able to confirm spawning items / weapons are affecting anything but Crab has said they also do, they just have a lower impact.</p>
<p>What i am able to confirm and you also should be able to is that spawning players on certain maps (see in the map pack) will greatly increase the server’s fps variance (var in net_graph 4) making them basically unplayable when more people are online and spawning at the same time, a quick note; these maps were fine before the update.</p>
<p>Another quick note; you don’t have to test them on a multiplayer server, opening up the game and loading the map will generate the same result.</p>

            <p>I seem to recall having a similar issue to the shotgun world model when I was working on my own (never finished) worldmodel a few years back. IIRC it was a misaligned collision mesh, should be relatively easy to diagnose and fix for the next patch.</p>
<p>Of course it’s probably already fixed, or will be as soon as whoever has the source files gets back from holidays.<br>
EDIT: See? I was right. Already fixed.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
