    <title>ZBrush anyone?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/zbrush-anyone/3272</link>
    <description>So I just discovered Zbrush a few days ago and was amazed by it. I&#39;m thinking of obtaining it and trying to use in conjunction with XSI Mod tool. 

    Does anyone else here have experience with Zbrush? And if you do, do you have any work you would like to show and/or tips you can share with using it?</description>
