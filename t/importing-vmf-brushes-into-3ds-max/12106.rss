    <title>Importing .vmf brushes into 3ds max</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/importing-vmf-brushes-into-3ds-max/12106</link>
    <description>What&#39;s the best way to do this? I&#39;ve been looking around online and most of them seem to be a hideous hassle. The simplest strategy so far seems to be to, in hammer, use &quot;export as .dxf&quot; but when I try to open the exported file in 3ds max it gives me this error: [img]https://puu.sh/22Q06[/img].

Does anyone have an idea as to what I&#39;m doing wrong or a suggestion for a better method?</description>

            <p>What’s the best way to do this? I’ve been looking around online and most of them seem to be a hideous hassle. The simplest strategy so far seems to be to, in hammer, use “export as .dxf” but when I try to open the exported file in 3ds max it gives me this error: <span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span>.</p>
