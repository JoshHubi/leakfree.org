    <title>Nintendo considering new business model</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/nintendo-considering-new-business-model/12942</link>
    <description>Nintendo appear to be considering incorporating smartphones and other platforms into its business model according to this article: [url]https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-17/nintendo-forecasts-net-loss-on-stagnating-sales-of-wii-u-games.html[/url]

While it doesn&#39;t specifically state the plans, I do hope this means that we&#39;ll see the likes of Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, etc on smartphones or even PS4/Xbox One.</description>

            <p>Even if this is cool and all, he seems to be pitching it as an attempt to save the company. That it is not. Nintendo needs to do something big to fix the shit they’ve pulled (been pulling).</p>

            <p>Not a bad idea. As long as they make the discounts significant enough and the method of acquiring them simple enough, I think it could be a good way to provide savings for their customers and build up their user base. But if it’s too difficult to obtain the savings, it’ll probably be viewed as a mail-in rebate: looks good, but no one will count on getting it and won’t factor it into their purchasing decisions. If the savings aren’t good enough, then it’ll be like trading in games at Gamestop: I paid this much money for my games and I get this tiny amount back?</p>
<p>Also would be interested to see Nintendo enter the mobile market with a Gameboy-style  phone. Something like a Galaxy S4 with controls like the 3DS’s built into it could be perfect for mobile gamers, if they can figure out the hardware and put a good OS on it.</p>

            <p>Fucking Nintendo man. Why can’t any of these big companies figure it out? The ONLY way to respond to the modernization of the consumer base is to jump the bandwagon before anyone else. If they don’t in some way put heir shit on smartphones, there mobile market WILL die. Maybe not soon, but eventually. And if it’s going to happen they better get in on this soon so they’ll have a jump start.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s mobile market is the new Blockbusters. It will have no place in the future and the best way to deal with that is to be the future.</p>
<p>Right now the smartphone market’s user base and developer base is geared towards shitty shallow contentless grinding games. Nintendo’s library is much much better. I think this is mostly because of the limitations of the touchscreen interface. There’s been repeated attempts to resolve this such as the xperia play, but they’ve all failed because they lacked the users base and dev base/games library. Nintendo suffers from neither. Nintendo better catch on quick and do what they are in the perfect position to do before someone else less suited succeeds.</p>

<p>Um, no it’s not. Careful with your wording there buddy. <a href="http://Nintendofusion.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Nintendofusion.com</a> is a domain first purchased by Nintendo for a tour that they recently renewed rights to. The specs and supposed existence of the “fusion” console originate from an unnamed source touted by your linked Nintendo News article. The two facts really don’t lend each other any credibility because it seems a lot more likely that <a href="http://nintendofusion.com" rel="nofollow noopener">nintendofusion.com</a> was renewed just so Nintendo could keep its already purchased domain, while some hoaxster pulled a bunch of information out of his ass and oriented it around the name/concept of fusion to give it credibility it doesn’t deserve.</p>
<p>I could be completely wrong and this hoax could actually turn out not to be a hoax, but I think the odds aren’t good.</p>

            <p>I honestly think Nintendo should consider publishing to Steam Machines, but I personally just love the base design of SteamOS, and thus am probably biased.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be bad if Nintendo also entered the Android App market.</p>
<p>So long as they don’t go into the “free to play” (a.k.a. “pay to win”) casual game market, I would probably be very happen with any new games by Nintendo.  I certainly do appreciate their creative appeal, even if their systems have been on the lean side, and many developers can’t figure out how to fully utilize them because of this.</p>

            <p>This is really weird. So if this is true then the console will have 2 CPUs as well as a GPU? And DDR4 and DDR3 RAM. Seems kind of a weird setup. But I suppose it’s making itself different from a PC at least.</p>

<p>Better 3rd party relations and marketing may indeed be the key to fixing it, however.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with this. Nintendo needs third party support for the Wii U and a lot more advertising. This can help them sell more systems.</p>
<p>I hope it doesn’t get worse for them before it gets better.</p>

            <p>Despite what the Machinima guy said, 960x640 is not a weird aspect ratio, it’s the same resolution as the iPhone 4/4s, so maybe they are planning some sort of smartphone support.</p>

<p>While the idea is interesting, the “reputable source” doesn’t sound at all reputable. Also, I DESPERATELY hope that Nintendo would learn at least something from the WiiU and at least drop the IBM CPU in future consoles. Perhaps it’s because they really want backwards compatability, but if given the choice between backwards compatability and a respectable 3rd part games lineup, I hope that most people would chose the latter. Not to mention anything Wii and earlier could be emulated easily.</p>
<p>The other source, which was actually from Nintendo, was a lot more interesting. I’ve always thought it’d be smart for Nintendo to release a Nintendo phone with proprietary hardware and emulators (or native support if that’s possible from an engineering/coding perspective) for backwards compatability with their entire mobile library in addition to still running android to pick up on the swathe of apps. It could have a detachable gameboy advanced shaped case with ABXY buttons, etc.</p>
<p>A lot of smart phone developers have tried to enter into more serious smartphone gaming, and there’s been a lot of demand, but they’ve all failed because they couldn’t build up the user base to attract developers, or build up the developer support to attract a user base. Nintendo has neither problem with a backwards compatible device and a loyal fanbase.</p>
<p>But releasing all their games as apps is good too, and would make me really happy. Nonetheless, I think the other option is a much smarter business venture, albeit riskier. The future of mobile gaming is on the android and IOS platforms. It’s just a matter of time before someone breaks into that market, and Nintendo is in the perfect position to do it before anyone else.</p>
