    <description>I will post here all the issues I´ve encounteredthat should be fixed and some advices.

1- vortigaunts do not get in a combat stance when they´re combat, like they do in hl2

2- Apache´s hp is way off (takes a shitload of rockets), is easier to destroy the osprey and even the abrams tank wtf

3- the crowbar doesn´t make splashes when you swing it on the water surface while in hl2 it does

4- when the hands get stained with blood or goo holding certain weapon, if you switch weapons, your hands won´t be stained with those, perphaps they should make the blood stains on hands toggleable

5- the shotgun shoot sound gets cut off when reloading, I wanted to replace the default with a better one with a bit of echo, but when I reload it gets cut off, seriously?

6- when barney shoots, his weapon doesn´t eject casings

7- mp5 magazines are huge, if you put an mp5 right next to it, the single mag is begger than the weapon ;(

8- in the level forget about freeman, when you get in a tunnel and a garg appears, it is suppose to crush the 2 marines that are next to it first, but it ignores them completely, and if you go somewhere else instead of climbing up to where the mortar map is, he will be shaking that container anyway

9- the .50 cal MG if gibs are enabled, it will always gib, even if it´s just one shot to the foot or something, is just odd, I disable gibbing when I grab one, (this one is my opinion) but also it seems the sound is too low due to some issue in the game, idk.

10- the mp5 glauncher sound suggests there was a quick grenade load afterwards, but it doesn´t happen, when reloading the bolt magically moves by itself, and the little bar inside the ring on the end top of the barrel to aim is missng.

11- if you throw a grenade it doesn´t go to far, but if you pick it up from the floor and toss it again, it does, the hell?

12- while kleiner´s voice was totally on the spot, eli´s voice seemed to be kinda unfitting, maybe is just me, idk

13- on a rail, when you get to the outside to get to the rocket controls and you 2 grunts talking, the way they talk sounds... cheesy, (not a game breaking issue, but they should redo that talk there at least)

14- the moon in on a rail is too big and thus unrealistic

15- the itchyosaur seems to be too weak even on hard

16- How come there aren´t leeches like in hl1 anymore?

17-The marines randomly say nonsensical stuffs like &quot;do it&quot; or &quot;I´m tired of playing games&quot; when you´re close to them, it sounds odd and cheesy, personally I changed those sound files with some radio chatter as if they were receiving a transmition.

and that´s what I can think of right now, there were more, but some fixes have been made and posted here

</aside>
<p>That’s such a ridiculous notion, first of all, this ISN’T a commercial game, it is a MOD! and there is nothing constructive at all about posting a long list of things that have no effect on the game’s functionality in anyway, I have no problem with people posting bugs, but these are not bug’s these are just someone reporting things that they feel should be changed, and I dunno, maybe you would rather see the Dev team have the crowbar make little splash effects on the water, but I would rather see them put time and effort into crahes or bugs that actually effect the games functionality.</p>

            <p>My God the nitpicks, what happened to just enjoying the game xD, it seems like 90% of the “bugs” reported are just people nitpicking the game to pieces…if it’s really that bad you could always just play the original half life again…-_-</p>

            <p>Anyone noticed the itchyosaur’s blood is red when you shoot at it! And when it dies and you keep shooting at it it’s color is green?</p>
