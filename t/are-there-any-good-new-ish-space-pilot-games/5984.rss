    <title>Are there any good (new-ish) space pilot games?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/are-there-any-good-new-ish-space-pilot-games/5984</link>
    <description>So I was at a friend&#39;s house yesterday and had a go on Halo Reach, and I really enjoyed the space level where you pilot the Longsword. This got me thinking, are there any decent flight-sim style games set in space? Preferably newer ones, so not Asteroids or X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter.</description>

            <p>But it’s still supposed to be a <span class="bbcode-b">game</span>… Does all first person shooters get you killed in one shot? I mean, it can withstand a few missiles, why couldn’t it withstand a slight scratch. I thought it was a bit extreme.</p>

            <p>Erm, it’s not a driving game where the car will get damaged in relation to the impact, spaceships are pressurised because space is a vacuum, so any hole in the structure could lead to massive depressurisation, easily tearing the ship to shreds.</p>

<p>I was just playing this… looks cool, but there doesn’t seem to be much tutorial on how to fly the damn thing…<br>
And I was flying around, following the arrows and stuff, and I was flying very close to a station of some kind… and then I wondered: what happens if I scratch my ship on it?</p>
<p>At the slightest bump, it pulled the camera outside the ship, and made my entire ship explode, with the words ‘GAME OVER’ on the screen… Seriously? :S</p>

            <p>Freelancer is pretty cool too… it’s a little more rpg-ish, while Freespace is a mission by mission thing. They’re both awesome IMO.</p>
<p>I heard EVE online is nice, but it’s a MMO, and I think it requires a monthly subscription or something.</p>

            <p>FreeSpace 2 + FSOpen</p>
<p>No, it isn’t really “new”, but it is the best space sim out there and, with all the mods and FreeSpace 1 remake included, it’s probably the best deal.</p>

            <p>What they’re doing with Descent Freespace is simply amazing. There’s some guy sitting somewhere re-rendering all the first game’s cutscenes in HD with extra detail. That’s what I call devotion and dedication to the job.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they were both made in the 90’s, but they are still awesome</p>

            <p>Descent Freespace 2 has an open source mod community at <a href="https://www.hard-light.net/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Hard-light.net</a>. They just keep on adding effects to what is still one of the best space combat sims out there. Think of big beam laser cannons on space cruisers and you being able to fire a flurry of wiggly missiles Anime style being part of the '99 game and all the lighting is now Dx9/10. They’re also working on a BSG mod there.</p>
