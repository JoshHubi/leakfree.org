    <description>Hay guys I am new to this forum I just downloaded black mesa today and I loved it and I  to say it&#39;s aswome and I can&#39;t really believe how you guy&#39;s did it.

The reason why I am here I want to know how do you import Zombie Sci model into 3ds max I haven&#39;t tried it yet because I am still looking for 3ds max to download I still know how to use that program but I need to find out how and where to get that model. 


But if you know where to get the model please explain.
