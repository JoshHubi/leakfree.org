Alright, just to kick things off. Halo is a generic uninspired shooter that&#39;s attracted nothing but kids. It has an uninspired story like and repetitive level design that puts too much stress on backtracking. Goldeneye is what really streamlined console shooter controls (even though the N64 controller is unlike anything in existence and is untranslatable to any other console, therefore rendering any &quot;control innovation&quot; made on the console complete forfeit). This looks exactly the same as the last three games I never played. Blah Blah Blah. I get it. We all get it. Alright, now on the actual thread.

Holy shit, that BR is fuck ugly.

The new armor is growing on me, and the new permutations are nice. I like that they brought back the plated knuckles from the Halo 1 first person model.

Glad sprint is back.

The new sound design direction is nice.

The new OST direction does not hold a candle to Marty&#39;s composition. That fast rhythm no substance shit doesn&#39;t fly here. I hope other tracks are better.

The overall graphical improvements are cool. The sun shafts look damn nice compared to other implementations. The aesthetic has the detail of Reach with the vibrant color scheme of Halo 3, which I love. It can only get better from here, and it&#39;s not bad atm. I also have to give em credit on the presentation. What we saw obviously wasn&#39;t gussied up at all. The frank delivery helped sell me on 343&#39;s efforts. I like it.


So, anyone else&#39;s thoughts? Like, the people who actually care and are interested though.</description>

            <p>Honestly it’s less about “do this because every game is doing it” and more about “do it because otherwise the fanbase will stagnate with zero new players, but at the same time make sure the new elements don’t suck the way they might suck in other games”.</p>
<p>But if not, then yeah they’ve announced a while back that they’re dedicating a whole playlist to Classic mode on launch.</p>
<p>It seems as of now the vast majority of the core fanbase likes the new direction more than Reach.</p>

            <p>ughh I’m not sure I like where all this is going. I hope there’s a classic mode again, I’m not going to hate on them for wanting to evolve the game and all, but I’m just not a fan of “do this because every game is doing this now”.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for release though, I’m a big Halo fan so you bet I’m getting the midnight launch and skipping a day of school afterwards lol. Nothing beats the Halo 3 launch for me though, it still makes me giddy inside thinking back to it.</p>

<p>This is one of the best sounding games I’ve ever heard. Seriously, this is sonic sugar.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the team they got together for 343 is the most amazing group of badasses I’ve ever seen under one roof. It’s kind of a shame they’re going to be limited to one IP. Hopefully when Microsoft realizes they need more exclusives, they’ll use these same guys to do something non-Halo.</p>

<p>This game is looking great imo.</p>
<p>lol’d at “SNIPERS CONFIRMED”</p>
<p>Ugh, the banshee still has that loopdeloop Reach flip. At least it’s slower.</p>

            <p>Fuck Halo 2 and 3’s seagulls. Halo 1 and 4’s JACKALS are what needs to stay.</p>
<p>There’s nothing unpredictable, agile, calculating about the Halo twee (two and three)'s deign aesthetic as a whole. Halo 1 looked awesome with it’s simple strokes of geometry creating an abundance of atmosphere with the fewest words possible. Twee totally fucked that when they went bat-shit-crazy with current gen graphic power and started doing what everyone else was doing; slimming everyone down and slapping extraneous panels on everything.Where Twee’s aesthetic would be composed of “Fuck… we have this huge blank space. Cover it in horizontal grooves! FUCK FLOW!”, Halo 1 was “We have this huge blank space. That’s all it needs to be”.</p>
<p>The Jackal was one of the worst parts for me, because it actually had a stalky and thick frame in the first game. They looked like alien versions of classic Spartans. <a href="https://www.entertainmentearth.com/images/AUTOIMAGES/NC49241lg.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Mohawk of spines</a>, <a href="https://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070103124709/halo/images/c/c3/Behindyou.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the bare arms, the ribbed body armor</a>… Fuck, the next gen of Jackal is more of a throwback than anything. The thick neck and beefy jaw, the shorter snout, the thicker teeth (still canines, but more reminiscent of the original donkey teeth than the Twee toothpicks), the torso to leg ratio favoring the legs again.</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/0/d/0dd0c8d63e87b16539e23b91ab42d5dd2376782f.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="1YdwBv7Fzx7wNuXVI1d2SvdhgkL" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>The only thing this is missing is the alien tribal tattoos. Those were awesome.</p>
<p>Plus take into account that they’ve (I believe) cut the skirmisher, meaning they’re probably combining the functionality of the two classes.</p>

<p>I actually preferred Halo 2/Halo3’s take on them.</p>
<p>When I look at the picture above, traits that come to mind include feral, unpredictable, agile, calculating, fragile.  They were a foil to the tall strong warrior Elites and the burly savage build of the Brutes.  They were generally…unpleasant looking.  The Elites looked tough and skilled and the Brutes were imposing.  But the Jackals just looked…nasty.  I could call them almost iconic.</p>
<p>Now they are generic alien monsters with sharp teeth and a huge head.  Yawn.  Not to mention the head does not fit the rest of the body.  Hell, why does it need that shield anymore?  Just run on ahead, chomp chomp chomp</p>

            <p>No, I agree. imo the sound design more than makes up for it though. I still miss the secondary explosions that happen when you destroy a banshee/ ghost. And those fucking sounds &lt;3</p>

            <p>Honestly? I actually dislike a lot of Halo 2’s art direction the most out of the series. Dunno why. Maybe it’s just me.</p>
