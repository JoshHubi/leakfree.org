          <p>I think the line is fine as-is.  Gordon DOES get to keep the suit.  He’s just not wearing it at the start of HL2.</p>
<p>And don’t forget the lines from Kleiner in “Red Letter Day”:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Dr. Kleiner">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Dr. Kleiner:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>“Well, Gordon, go ahead. Slip into your suit now.”<br>
“Well, Gordon, I see your HEV suit still fits you like a glove. At least the glove parts do. I’ve made a few modifications, but I’ll just acquaint you with the essentials. Now, let’s see…”</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s clear that it’s the same HEV suit from HL1 but with “a few modifications”.  I’d say to leave the line as-is.</p>

          <p>I’m sure that after all the years that have been spent on this that the BM creators have arrived at a very long thought out decision on how to end their creation. Personally, I don’t think there’s any need at all in discussing it. However, if it doesn’t end appropriately then we should all ask for our money back!</p>

<p>20yrs. actually, not 10. HL2 takes place in 202-.</p>
<p>I personally think that some scientists at Black Mesa did, in fact, know G-Man, just like Eli knows him, and also know what happened more precisely. I assume that, provided it’s the same suit, but modified, not another one, G-Man simply gave it to Kleiner after putting Freeman in stasis, so that he will be able to use it when the time comes.</p>
<p>Now that I come to think, there’s something rather intriguing.</p>
<p>Most (if not actually all) of the people in HL2 are surprised when they see Gordon back, but none of them is actually <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">shocked</span></span> (after all, most would’ve assumed that Freeman died during the Xen battle with Nihilanth, since he returns after 20 yrs. and no one heard anything about him since then), none of them have reactions like ,Wow, is that really you? But… I though you died 20yrs ago during the BM Incident,.</p>
<p>IMO a number of people know what happened during this period, at least partially. This is pretty much a ,G-Man conspiracy theory, (to say so), but there are quite a few questions left unanswered to this date. Guess we’ll never know for sure until HL3 comes out (if it comes out at all).</p>

<p>It could happen.  You don’t know what happened over the ~20 years.  And how could Kleiner make the necessary modifications to the suit if Gordon was wearing it while in stasis?  I think G-Man was simply saying that Gordon gets to keep the suit (unlike the guns he received through his travels through the facility) but facilitated its upgrade from Kleiner so it had to be removed from his person for the time being.</p>

<p>Yep.  When Barney introduces Gordon to Kleiner, he says, “I expected more warning” and Barney says, “You and me both, Doc.”  It’s apparent that at least they knew Gordon would return, but didn’t know when.  And it appears that Breen knew something about it too, as he tells the advisor during the transporter “malfunction”, “I’m almost certain it was… Gordon Freeman.”</p>
<p>I think they all knew Gordon would be back and, for Kleiner, he’d have to upgrade the suit for Gordon’s eventual return.  That’s why he had it all set up in the closet ready to go.  They were prepared for Gordon’s return.</p>

<p>I personally think that some scientists at Black Mesa did, in fact, know G-Man, just like Eli knows him, and also know what happened more precisely.

<p>Some surely did, Eli Vance, Wallace Breen and a few others, but not all of them. Kleiner for instance, I don’t think he knows anything about G-Man. Just like how Barney and Alyx doesn’t even know he exists. (Barney was out of reach, so he never met G-Man and Alyx was too young to remember)</p>
<p>So what might have happened is something like, G-Man took your HEV suit and delivered it to Eli Vance, whom in turn gave it to Kleiner, possibly guessing Gordon might return someday.</p>
<p>About the stasis part, I don’t think Gordon Freeman was ever in stasis, or sleeping like some claim, he was awake the whole time, just not 20 years, only a few moments. He was teleported in a place where time is very slow compered to ours (like the edge of a black hole), so for him, it was just a few moments, but for the rest of the world, 20 years had passed.</p>

<p>What I found more intriguing is that, no one is shocked about how he hasn’t aged a day.

<p>It could happen.  You don’t know what happened over the ~20 years.  And how could Kleiner make the necessary modifications to the suit if Gordon was wearing it while in stasis?

</aside>
<p>My point was, he takes it from you in the first game, not while in stasis (and it probably wasn’t a stasis, more like a time dilation thing. He puts you in a place time passes really slow.) And he probably doesn’t deliver it to Kleiner directly. G-Man doesn’t make contact with everyone, he only makes contact with people that will help his and his employers agenda. (If he contacted everyone he ever sees, he wouldn’t be mysterious, it would be a mess. He doesn’t get involved in everything, he was even hesitant to save Alyx as a child, even though Eli knew about him at that point.) G-Man probably delivers the HEV suit to either Eli (who gaves it to Kleiner), or it appears out of nowhere.</p>
<p>And as the HEV suit was removed from Gordon for a time being, adding an extra like would serve that. At the Black Mesa ending, G-Man should say something to reflect that.</p>

<p>The problem is with that, Barney didn’t know about G-Man. He never met him. (remember Blue Shift?) What they could have meant with that, is something like, “I would have heard about it if something like that happened.” They monitor combine movements, they watch everything closely. Thats why they have a man inside (Barney of course)</p>
<p>And Breen just seemed surprised. Not because he knew about it, but maybe because he was told and didn’t believe it. (does that make sense?  I don’t think I am explaining what I think correctly.)</p>
<p>Also, Kleiner is a scientist, he like tinkering stuff. Even if Gordon never returned, a HEV suit would be useful for rebels. Of course he would work on it, he doesn’t need another reason for that. (An upgraded HEV suit is always more useful) And probably it wasn’t prepared for Gordon, maybe Kleiner was just finished upgrading it or he was still working on it to improve upon it. (maybe it was meant for someone else. Maybe Barney or Alyx even.) Or maybe he was keeping it around for one day they may need it. They were trying to blend in and it is a hazard suit, you wouldn’t wear it unless you had a reason for it. (the rebellion movement was slow back then.)</p>

<p>Actually I think that from the former Science Team, Eli and Breen knew A LOT more about Gordon, G-Man, and the events. Breen even says at the end of HL2: ,Do you know that your contract was opened to the highest bidder?, , which clearly implies that G-Man sold Gordon’s services to someone. Also when he dies, he even screams ,YOU NEED ME!!,. That’s very interesting. What if Breen survived? There still is actually a theory which implies that Breen DID in fact… well not ,survive, (to say so) but transferred his memories to an Advisor seen in Episode One, when that recording from the end of HL2 is seen.</p>
<p>What if Breen still exists? What would he do now?</p>
<p>,Who, is that someone is open for speculation so far. Some believe that they’ve been sold to the Combine, but I personally don’t know what to say about this. It certainly is a theory, but given how mysterious G-Man is, that ,clients, could be very well someone else we have no idea about yet.</p>
<p>I don’t think that Barney and Alyx know about G-Man either. We don’t know much about Barney’s past in detail so it could be a possibility, but he never meets him in Blue Shift nor mention/make references to him in HL2 (as a matter of fact, are there are G-Man sightings BS?).</p>
<p>I very much doubt the theory that Alyx know anything about G-Man. She was way too young when the BM Incident took place, and since Eli hates everything that happened back then, I’m strongly inclined to deny the idea of him telling Alyx about G-Man. Damn sure he wanted to forget about the past.</p>
<p>But of course that doesn’t mean that Alyx is of no use to him. He does make some strong implications during the cutscene in This Vortal Coil in Episode 2 that he acted ,in the face of objections, that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone, and ,he’s not one to squander his investments and remained confident that she was worth far more than the initial appraisal,. He surely has something in store for Alyx.</p>
<p>Curios about Shepherd tbh. I think it’s inevitable that we’ll eventually see one day his return, but I’m curious about the circumstances. The story has great potential here. Will Gordon be his enemy? Will they be allies of some sort? Someday we’ll find out.</p>
<p>As about ,HEV Suit kept for someone else other than Gordon,… no, I’m highly suspicious toward this idea. It could also be kept as a sort of ,artifact, honestly, in Freeman’s memory. The reason for keeping the suit and even improving it still remains unknown, there are just too many possibilities here.</p>
<p>And ,Gordon hasn’t aged a bit and no one cares, , yeah, that’s by far the most interesting thing related to the events. They would surely be very confused to see him 20yrs. later and still look the same, but for some reason, they just aren’t. Eli is just slightly surprised, and the rest don’t even seem to care about that, like ,Oh, 20yrs. later are nothing. It’s like it was just yesterday,.</p>
<p>Stasis: As far as I’m aware Gordon IS in fact put into stasis. I think this is actually official, but the idea of a place where time passes extremely slow could as well be a possibility.</p>

<p>I agree with most of your points (as I made similar points) I also think Breen survived (kinda, his mind may have survived, but maybe not as a whole.), I may even go as far to say he might be one of Advisors that killed Eli (the one who sucked out his brains.) certainly something to think about.</p>
<p>One thing I am confident though, G-Man’s employers is not Combine. (Perhaps the beings that control Combine, but not directly Combine.)</p>

<p>Stasis: As far as I’m aware Gordon IS in fact put into stasis. I think this is actually official, but the idea of a place where time passes extremely slow could as well be a possibility.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Nowhere in or outside of the game it states anything about stasis. There is nothing about it that indicates stasis either. I mean, where G-Man takes us is just a black space of nothingness and leaves us there. That’s all we know. (And we only know that thanks to the ending of the second game. In the first game, you just jump trough a portal. Where exactly the portal takes you is a mystery until the second game.) The fact that he comes in there with you without either of you go into stasis and then (opens a door and leaves while you are watching him, still not in stasis) indicates that there is no stasis. Unless you put yourself in stasis by sheer power of will.</p>

<p>And ,Gordon hasn’t aged a bit and no one cares, , yeah, that’s by far the most interesting thing related to the events. They would surely be very confused to see him 20yrs. later and still look the same, but for some reason, they just aren’t. Eli is just slightly surprised, and the rest don’t even seem to care about that, like ,Oh, 20yrs. later are nothing. It’s like it was just yesterday,.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Maybe we are over thinking this part. As far as I know, “20 years has passed” part was kinda retconned later. If I remember correctly, the original estimate was 10 years. It is still weird that they don’t ask why he is still so young, but some people can age better than others. So, while developing the game, they might not put so much thought into that part, mainly because gap wasn’t supposed to be so big. After all, in HL2, it wasn’t stated how much time has passed.</p>

<p>As about ,HEV Suit kept for someone else other than Gordon,… no, I’m highly suspicious toward this idea. It could also be kept as a sort of ,artifact, honestly, in Freeman’s memory. The reason for keeping the suit and even improving it still remains unknown, there are just too many possibilities here.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Like I have said, a HEV suit is always useful for a scientist. Perhaps they were using it for the teleportation experiments. It has all the right tools for it. (an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user’s health and vital signs, reacting to any changes in the user’s condition, has an electrically hardened armour system that can be charged at HEV chargers etc., so it has a chance to protect the user if something went wrong during teleportation and so on.) I am just saying that there could be more reasons why they kept the damn thing other than waiting for Gordon to appear out of nowhere.</p>

<p>Curios about Shepherd tbh. I think it’s inevitable that we’ll eventually see one day his return, but I’m curious about the circumstances. The story has great potential here. Will Gordon be his enemy? Will they be allies of some sort? Someday we’ll find out.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When I stop to think about it, I wonder about this as well. My theory is that, since Gordon is free from G-Man at the moment (thanks to Vortigaunts) and G-Man can’t directly interfere (he openly says so that he agreed not to interfere directly, agreed with whom, it is unclear.), at some point, he will employ Adrian Shepard against Gordon Freeman and Vortigaunts. (to take back the control of the situation.) Being the good soldier he is (though I think he will be misguided and manipulated by G-Man, he will go after Freeman.), he will do everything to stop Gordon Freeman. (As it was his mission from the beginning.) Unless they turn him to our side. How about that! <img src="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wcf/images/smilies/biggrin.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>

<p>I don’t think that Barney and Alyx know about G-Man either. We don’t know much about Barney’s past in detail so it could be a possibility, but he never meets him in Blue Shift nor mention/make references to him in HL2 (as a matter of fact, are there are G-Man sightings BS?).</p>
<p>I very much doubt the theory that Alyx know anything about G-Man. She was way too young when the BM Incident took place, and since Eli hates everything that happened back then, I’m strongly inclined to deny the idea of him telling Alyx about G-Man. Damn sure he wanted to forget about the past.</p>
<p>But of course that doesn’t mean that Alyx is of no use to him. He does make some strong implications during the cutscene in This Vortal Coil in Episode 2 that he acted ,in the face of objections, that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone, and ,he’s not one to squander his investments and remained confident that she was worth far more than the initial appraisal,. He surely has something in store for Alyx.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree, but I don’t think Kleiner ever met or heard about G-Man either. I don’t think Eli would share what he knows about G-Man with anyone. (He wouldn’t even tell Gordon If Alyx didn’t deliver G-Man’s message.)</p>
<p>G-Man has plans for Alyx, of that I am sure. But I think he didn’t act upon them mostly because of the Vortigaunts. I think since they are always aware of his presence and would stop him, he is unable to use her the way he need at the moment. (as far as we know Vortigaunts always been a part of the rebellion)</p>

<p>While I have to admit that I’m just generally opposed to any sort of change because I don’t want Black Mesa to alter things in accommodation of a game that I don’t particularly <span class="bbcode-i">like</span>, dky is also right that even when considering BM as a prequel to HL2, it fits more with G-Man’s character to keep the old line. From what we see of G-Man, he prefers to engineer circumstances to cause a desired outcome, seldom gives people exactly what they want or exactly what they <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> they’re getting, and in face-to-face interaction confers precious little information, preferring statements that <span class="bbcode-i">sound</span> definitive but are in fact misleading half-truths. Considering that the removal of this sort of “prime mover” role on G-Man’s part in later episodes is one of the main reasons I <span class="bbcode-i">don’t</span> like Half-Life 2, I would be very disappointed if the more limited take was projected back into BM.</p>

<p>Honestly, having G-Man not tell you what he’s going to do with the suit fits his character more.</p>

</aside>
<p>It is not like he ever lies to you. He just doesn’t tell you some things. He tells you that he will take your weapons and he takes it. He tells you that you will keep the HEV suit and… he takes it. You see, thats just where it doesn’t make sense, it was apparently retconned. The way I suggested it, he still doesn’t tell you what he is going to do, but he tells you that he is taking the HEV suit until you need it again. Makes sense? I mean, like I have said, while he always keeps information from you, he never says something and does it otherwise, G-Man isn’t someone who speaks in riddles. He is quite literal when it comes to what he is going to do.</p>

<p>But to make all the changes Kleiner did, Kleiner must have been working on the HEV suit for some time. We don’t know how long he had it, but long enough to make it compatible with Combine tech. (considering that it is alien technology, it should be a fairly long time) So, G-Man did remove the suit from you after all. Game just needs to reflect that by adding a simple line.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While I have to admit that I’m just generally opposed to any sort of change because I don’t want Black Mesa to alter things in accommodation of a game that I don’t particularly <span class="bbcode-i">like</span>, dky is also right that even when considering BM as a prequel to HL2, it fits more with G-Man’s character to keep the old line. From what we see of G-Man, he prefers to engineer circumstances to cause a desired outcome, seldom gives people exactly what they want or exactly what they <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> they’re getting, and in face-to-face interaction confers precious little information, preferring statements that <span class="bbcode-i">sound</span> definitive but are in fact misleading half-truths. Considering that the removal of this sort of “prime mover” role on G-Man’s part in later episodes is one of the main reasons I <span class="bbcode-i">don’t</span> like Half-Life 2, I would be very disappointed if the more limited take was projected back into BM.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I am not saying we should get rid of the old line, I am just saying that we should add a small line next to it, G-Man is fine as he is in HL1, but it doesn’t mean adding small things like that will ruin it.</p>
<p>I don’t think G-Man was changed even a bit from HL1 to HL2, it seems a bit different because the circumstances has changed. He is not GOD like, he is just a being thats very powerful.</p>
