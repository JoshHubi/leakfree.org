    <title>My One Criticism</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-one-criticism/12901</link>
    <description>I have played through the original Half Life twice and Black Mesa so much I have lost track. I think all the maps do the original justice (including Surface Tension Uncut and the On A Rail Uncut Beta). I was, however, pretty disappointed with the cliff side in surface tension. It looks incredible, but it has more of the same shoot-and-run feel to it. There is less sniping (my favorite part of any FPS) in Black Mesa, and not being able to snipe here was a bit of a let down.

In Half Life, right after crawling out of the pipe (where the fighter jet flies by), you can shoot a marine and sentry with the crossbow, as well as the marine underneath you. During my first playthrough of Half Life, I actually killed every single enemy with the crossbow, without once being detected. It was a nice change of pace to sit down, take time lining up the shot, and move on to the next target. I really think for the final release of Black Mesa, the cliff side and troop placement should be tweaked to allow sniping. I also hope that they change the AI so they don&#39;t detect you as quick. I just peak over a cliff, and the marines (hundreds of feet below) immediately shoot me in the face.

Also, on the cliff side, the wooden bridge doesn&#39;t break like in Half Life. I miss that as well.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only one who is this critical of the cliff side portion. I haven&#39;t seen any posts about this, although I haven&#39;t really searched. This is my first time on these forums.</description>

            <p>Well i guess the statement seems precise. It may be down to AI though, I think so<br>

            <p>I agree with OP though. I don’t remember exactly as it’s been a while, but his observation seems accurate. It may be down to AI though, I don’t know.</p>

<p>Your-name-here, the principle programmer for Black Mesa, has pretty much gone on record to say that he wants to make AI a focus for the next release. I couldn’t hope of finding the particular post right now though because it’s buried somewhere. It is going to happen, and things will be much better at the next release.</p>
<p>tl;dr They’re already improving the AI.</p>

<p>This is close to impossible in Black Mesa, stealth isn’t really part of the game.</p>
