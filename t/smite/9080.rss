Anyone else playing Smite?
Smite is a new MOBA-type game, in 3rd person. You can sign up for the closed beta, it should be pretty easy to get in. If you get in, you also get 3 keys that you can give out to your friends. It is pretty awesome!</description>

            <p>I’m in the closed beta, though i dont get to play often cause i’m in school working on finals at the moment, probably play a bit more once that’s all over… I’ve only played one match, it was pretty fun. i’m horrible at MOBA games and i feel i did at least a little better in Smite than Dota2/LoL. I live near Hi-Rez (the developers) and know one of the guys that works there, they’re a pretty cool bunch, really interesting to hear about how the idea for Smite and Tribes Ascend got going</p>
