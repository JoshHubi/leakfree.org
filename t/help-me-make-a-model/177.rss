    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-me-make-a-model/177</link>
    <description>So, I got Maya a while back, but I still haven&#39;t done shit because I am completely lost with the interface.  That&#39;s what this thread is for; I&#39;ll be making a character model here and posting pics.  Meanwhile, I&#39;ll be asking help at different intervals and HOPEFULLY, someone will be kind enough to dispel any questions.  This could also be quite the helpful thread for any other model-maker-hopeful.

[u]OVERALL PREMISE[/u]
The tresants were the first bit of the fauna of Karamajo Earth encountered when they invaded the jungle planet during the Karamajen Wars.  Though unintelligent animals with dimensions of 3x5 feet, these extraterrestrial creatures proved to be a terror for the first human soldiers that arrived on the planet.

The tresants started out as cave dwelling creatures, and were the top of the cave food chain.  However, during the Karamajen Stone Age, when the feline-like aliens inhabited caves, the tresants were driven out.  The tresants were quick to adapt to their new jungle environment.  

Tresants comprise of a small, hairy, spherical center, with three legs radiating from it.  The bulbous center houses a bundle of neuron-like cells, which serve as a primitive brain.  The three legs are as much for movement as for defense and offense; each leg ends in a diamond shaped “shield”.  This “shield” is comprised of a hard organic material, akin to bone, and is nigh colorless on every individual.  The upper and lower point of each shield ends in a very sharp tip, which helps the creature with traction and provides it with a deadly weapon.  If attacked, tresants will hide the important center from it’s attacker by covering it with two shields, the back shield helping maintain stability.  The front side of the shield is featureless, while the backside contains two vital body parts for the tresant; a bundle of sensitive feelers and two siphons.  Because the tresant was originally a cave dwelling creature, it developed no visual organs.  Instead, the tresant relies on ground vibrations, and uses its feelers to detect them.  The siphon is used to feed.  When the tresant kills its prey, it impales its victim with its shield and uses one siphon to inject the body with acid.  The other siphon sucks up the resulting cocktail.  Because they are faceless, tresants have no real orientation.  The upper half of the body is a mirror image of the lower half and the knees are able to bend both ways.  This allows the tresant to move around on its “back” with ease.  The same applies in the horizontal aspect; tresants can suddenly move in the opposite direction by simply changing the orientation of one of its legs and without ever turning around.  Stories from the early invasion days depicted stories of soldiers attempting to sneak up on a tresant while it was feeding on other fauna.  The tresant, feeling the vibrations of their footsteps, would suddenly attack from the rear.  Tresants, therefore, cannot be described with “backwards”, “forwards”, or “upside down”, and in effect they are nearly impossible to sneak up on.

Tresants make up for their relatively small stature by traveling in huge groups.  Groups are nearly unstoppable, and have been known to decimate entire bases, if they are not properly defended.  Because they are relatively unintelligent, they have no fear, and never stop attacking until they are satisfied with their meal, or they believe they have defended their hive.  The hive is usually dug into the earth, and is comprised of a large dug out cavern and an immense queen.  Queens act as the females, and lay eggs to generate more tresants.  However, younger tresants have no sex.  When they come of age, they either remain normal tresants or their sex, and some of their DNA, is altered.  If they are to become queens, there size increases to more than 300x500 feet.  To keep this growth constant, queens must intake a vast amount of food every day.  For the rest of their lives, they do nothing but eat and lay eggs.  Because of their vulnerability, queens burrow themselves in the ground, creating the hive cavern.  A worker class is tasked with constantly bringing food to the queen.  If the food is inadequate, the queen eats the worker.  Because of the absence of eyes, this happens very often.</description>

<p>The Karamajan Warrior War Mech is even worse.  It has it’s latter half removed so it can just run around on it’s paws, which actually works much better.</p>

<p>The thing you have to understand about 3d modeling is this. You need reference from the front, back, and side because grasping user interfaces and 2d/3d space is too difficult to ad-lib, even for pros; the first drawings you do are going to be the easiest part, and your 3d model is only going to look as good as the reference images you start with. It isn’t like using a pencil where you can start rough and then fill in the detail, with 3d modeling you pretty much have to be precise 100% of the time or you’ll end up with crap.</p>
<p>In other words, my primary advice to you is to work on the drawing until it doesn’t suck, and don’t start modeling until that point, unless you also want your model to suck. I suggest finding some reference images (cats? muscles?) and observing them while you draw.</p>
<p>I can’t give you any advice on the Maya interface because I haven’t used it in years (I use 3ds Max/Blender). But virtually everyone I know who can model learned the basic concept from one tutorial - <a href="https://www.3dtotal.com/pages/tutorials/max/joanofarc/joanmenu.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Joan of Arc</a>. You don’t have to actually follow it, you could use your own design, but I believe that if you just read the whole thing you’ll have a much better idea of the correct process of modeling a character.</p>
<p>If this process doesn’t appeal to you, I recommend trying out Zbrush - it is a different sort of modeling  (easier) more suited to relatively fast concept art and characters.</p>
<p>Also - there is no goddamn reason ever for you to post terrible pencil drawings at a resolution larger than my 23" monitor. Okay, it’s not actually larger, but those pictures are needlessly huge!</p>

            <p>Alright, sorry for the epic bump.</p>
<p>I’ve ditched the Tresant as my first model because I don’t feel I’m ready to give it credit.  Instead, I’m gonna try and model a Karamajan Warrior, a feline alien with massive arms and pecs but with a wimpy backside and legs.  I’ve gone through many drafts, and this is the best I could get.  I suck at drawing, so STFU. =P</p>

            <p>Well, see, I don’t know how I should start it.  In essence, it should look like a peace sign from the top with the legs sticking out.  The middle would be the spherical body.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I should just create a polygonal spherical and then attach individual modified polygonal cylinders or if I should use the extrude method.  I don’t know how I would achieve the type of symmetry I’m going for, though.</p>

<p>So, I got Maya a while back, but I still haven’t done shit because I am completely lost with the interface.  That’s what this thread is for; I’ll be making a character model here and posting pics.  Meanwhile, I’ll be asking help at different intervals and HOPEFULLY, someone will be kind enough to dispel any questions.  This could also be quite the helpful thread for any other model-maker-hopeful.</p>

The tresants were the first bit of the fauna of Karamajo Earth encountered when they invaded the jungle planet during the Karamajen Wars.  Though unintelligent animals with dimensions of 3x5 feet, these extraterrestrial creatures proved to be a terror for the first human soldiers that arrived on the planet.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">He’s trying to make some weird ass creatures with “dimensions of 3x5 feet”</span> (don’t ask me…)</p>
<p>The tresants started out as cave dwelling creatures, and were the top of the cave food chain.  However, during the Karamajen Stone Age, when the feline-like aliens inhabited caves, the tresants were driven out.  The tresants were quick to adapt to their new jungle environment.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">They lived in caves, now they live in the jungle</span></p>
<p>yadda yadda yadda</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Basically he’s describing how they should look.</span></p>
<p>Tresants make up for their relatively small stature by traveling in huge groups.  Groups are nearly unstoppable, and have been known to decimate entire bases, if they are not properly defended.  Because they are relatively unintelligent, they have no fear, and never stop attacking until they are satisfied with their meal, or they believe they have defended their hive.  The hive is usually dug into the earth, and is comprised of a large dug out cavern and an immense queen.  Queens act as the females, and lay eggs to generate more tresants.  However, younger tresants have no sex.  When they come of age, they either remain normal tresants or their sex, and some of their DNA, is altered.  If they are to become queens, there size increases to more than 300x500 feet.  To keep this growth constant, queens must intake a vast amount of food every day.  For the rest of their lives, they do nothing but eat and lay eggs.  Because of their vulnerability, queens burrow themselves in the ground, creating the hive cavern.  A worker class is tasked with constantly bringing food to the queen.  If the food is inadequate, the queen eats the worker.  Because of the absence of eyes, this happens very often.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">They travel in groups. They have queens that lay eggs. They have no gender (so no pen0rs blue kthx). Queen is huge as shit and she behave like a pregnant woman. A blind one. Cause she doesn’t have any eyes…</span></p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">OVERALL PREMISE</span><br>
The tresants were the first bit of the fauna of Karamajo Earth encountered when they invaded the jungle planet during the Karamajen Wars.  Though unintelligent animals with dimensions of 3x5 feet, these extraterrestrial creatures proved to be a terror for the first human soldiers that arrived on the planet.</p>
<p>The tresants started out as cave dwelling creatures, and were the top of the cave food chain.  However, during the Karamajen Stone Age, when the feline-like aliens inhabited caves, the tresants were driven out.  The tresants were quick to adapt to their new jungle environment.</p>
<p>Tresants comprise of a small, hairy, spherical center, with three legs radiating from it.  The bulbous center houses a bundle of neuron-like cells, which serve as a primitive brain.  The three legs are as much for movement as for defense and offense; each leg ends in a diamond shaped “shield”.  This “shield” is comprised of a hard organic material, akin to bone, and is nigh colorless on every individual.  The upper and lower point of each shield ends in a very sharp tip, which helps the creature with traction and provides it with a deadly weapon.  If attacked, tresants will hide the important center from it’s attacker by covering it with two shields, the back shield helping maintain stability.  The front side of the shield is featureless, while the backside contains two vital body parts for the tresant; a bundle of sensitive feelers and two siphons.  Because the tresant was originally a cave dwelling creature, it developed no visual organs.  Instead, the tresant relies on ground vibrations, and uses its feelers to detect them.  The siphon is used to feed.  When the tresant kills its prey, it impales its victim with its shield and uses one siphon to inject the body with acid.  The other siphon sucks up the resulting cocktail.  Because they are faceless, tresants have no real orientation.  The upper half of the body is a mirror image of the lower half and the knees are able to bend both ways.  This allows the tresant to move around on its “back” with ease.  The same applies in the horizontal aspect; tresants can suddenly move in the opposite direction by simply changing the orientation of one of its legs and without ever turning around.  Stories from the early invasion days depicted stories of soldiers attempting to sneak up on a tresant while it was feeding on other fauna.  The tresant, feeling the vibrations of their footsteps, would suddenly attack from the rear.  Tresants, therefore, cannot be described with “backwards”, “forwards”, or “upside down”, and in effect they are nearly impossible to sneak up on.</p>
<p>Tresants make up for their relatively small stature by traveling in huge groups.  Groups are nearly unstoppable, and have been known to decimate entire bases, if they are not properly defended.  Because they are relatively unintelligent, they have no fear, and never stop attacking until they are satisfied with their meal, or they believe they have defended their hive.  The hive is usually dug into the earth, and is comprised of a large dug out cavern and an immense queen.  Queens act as the females, and lay eggs to generate more tresants.
