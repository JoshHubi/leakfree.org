    <title>Cliff helicopter fight crashes my game completely</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cliff-helicopter-fight-crashes-my-game-completely/11369</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m really enjoying this mod but faced a gamebreaking bug (for me) that doesn&#39;t allow me to continue this amazing game. :[

When I kill the helicopter with the rocket launcher (in that cliff level) the game completely crashes. Any idea what I can do about this?

using dual e6600 at 3ghz
ATI 6670 1gb
3 gb ram

Many thanks in advance!  :slight_smile: 

attached mdmp file as instructed

            <p>Just a quick update.</p>
<p>I managed to stop the crash from happening by going to taskbar and setting hl2.exe priority to “high” instead of “normal”. No idea if that was a coincidence or I was just lucky. Hopefully somebody would know.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>It’s really irritating because I have had a flawless experience so far. Then all of a sudden I simply can’t continue the story !  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Not to mention that bastard helicopter is hard to kill in the first place lol !  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
