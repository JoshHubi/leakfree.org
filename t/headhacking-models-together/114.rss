    <description>Hi, I&#39;m trying to swap Kleiner&#39;s head with that of male_02 (though keeping the glasses), as part of a mod I&#39;m working with. I have 3dsmax, and I&#39;ve decompiled both models. Currently I&#39;m at this stage:

-Removed Kleiner&#39;s head mesh
-Removed Male_02&#39;s body mesh
-Put the above two together in the same file, but not as the same object. As in: I haven&#39;t attached the head to the Kleiner skeleton yet.
-No materials at the moment

Can anyone tell me where to go from here? In fact, a simple walkthrough of the process from start to finish would be immensely helpful. I saw in the trailer that you&#39;ve done something similar (was that the original kleiner model you used with the texture cleaned up or did you make the labcoats from scratch?). If it&#39;s not too much trouble, could at least point me in the right direction?

Thanks for any help you can give!</description>

            <p>As far as i know you need to attach the head to the rest of the body BEFORE you bind the model to the skeleton…in which case you’ll first need to detach the skeleton from the rest of the body</p>

            <p>i think you should acutlally put the two togather { you need to make a new weightmap and blend the two old bones togather , those in particular you should google about }</p>

            <p>Yes, I’ve got that far. I’m more interested in the technical aspects, such as actually putting the two together (attaching the new head to the bones and merging in the neck, either making a new weightmap or blending the two old ones - that in particular I don’t know a particular lot about) that I’m needing help with.</p>
