    <title>installed on drive D, steam sees it but doesnt launch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/installed-on-drive-d-steam-sees-it-but-doesnt-launch/12211</link>
    <description>I have two hard drives on my PC and installed steam and the mods on drive D: steam sees the mods but wont run them. HL2 and all other games work fine.

I also got another mod, but that one doesnt work either, same issue. I am guessing that the drive path is not being passed correctly? how do I fix?</description>

            <p>BM doesn’t have a set drive path. I’ve got Steam installed on my E: partition, and all my games including BM work perfectly. Do you have the Source SDK along with with 2006 &amp; 2007 Base packs installed, and run each of them once?</p>
