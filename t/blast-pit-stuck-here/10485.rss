            <p>Perhaps a point_clientcommand entity could be used in the map at that section to ensure gravity is set to 600? While it might be more ideal to fix that bug, it would also ensure someone could get through if they changed gravity on their own for whatever reason.</p>

<p>If you’re certain there are no vents you can get into and you’ve tried everything, there’s only one issue I can think of that might cause it.<br>
Open the console, and make sure sv_gravity is set to 600. If it isn’t, set it to 600 by typing:</p>
<p>sv_gravity 600</p>
<p>It’s possible your gravity might have been accidentally set to 800. This is because our SP game uses 600 gravity but MP uses 800. It was a weird bug we had right back when we first implemented MP, which broke this section of SP very specifically, because you couldn’t access any vent.</p>
<p>That’s really all I can think of. See if that helps.</p>

            <p>Ok. That worked. Thanks.<br>
sv_gravity was set to 800.</p>
<p>Just a small point.</p>
<p>It would be great when people respond to requests for help if they don’t assume that people know to take the action necessary.</p>
<p>For example. I had to lookup a Youtube video on how to open the Dev Console to make that simple change to the sv_gravity value.</p>
<p>Most people don’t fiddle with these types of features. They just want to play the game and so they would not necessarily knowi how to open the console.</p>
<p>This little issues took many frustrating hours to resolve and the problem should not have been there in the first place.<br>
I have all the Half-Life games but this issue definitely too the enjoyment out of this game for me.</p>
<p>I noticed that at least one other person had the same problem as me, but I didn’t see a reply that could have helped him.<br>
It makes me wonder if he resolved the problem or just gave up as I was about to do.</p>
<p>I think that the developers of this game should publish a list of known bugs (and this is definitely a bug) and how to resolve them.</p>

Someone said that being close to the wall allows you to move down but not in my version (Steam on PC). Also that only one vent is attainable.<br>

First, give people a chance to respond.</p>
<p>Second, there is one vent that you can access. <a href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/278471773757481693/387B083BB61E471B2EDEFF3D82A2AD260F728AF4/" data-bbcode="true">See here for which one.</a>  You may have to crouch to get in.</p>

It’s in “Blast Pit”. I have merged the threads.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Daniel. You put a lot of work into helping me and I really appreciate it.<br>
Somehow I missed the door in that level when I was looking from the control room. I feel that I’ve earned my stripes as a “Cockroach”. but I’m very happy that I can get back to enjoying the game.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Okay, it appears that you do have the correct game, but you appear to only have started the power. See the picture here where to go next:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>[attach=3644,none,1280][/attach]</p>
</div>
<p>You appear to have gone all the way to the bottom (Level 4), but you need to go to the floor above it to get to the fuel and oxygen lines.<br>

            <p>Thanks, Daniel.<br>
Here are two screen shots of whatever game I am playing. The first one is the view from the transition room leaving the tentacle silo.<br>
The second one is of the elevator shaft at the end of the walk from the tentacle silo. I took this elevator (The elevator is at the bottom now.) to get to the generator silo.<br>
If you like, tomorrow I will find the comparable scenes from the game everyone here has been playing. In your game, the corridor  from the tentacle silo has a red and a blue pipe beneath a metal grate. In my game it is just cement.<br>

        <title>BLAST PIT - Stuck here?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[danielsangeo]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here’s what to do in Blast Pit, step-by-step (in the spoilers):</p>
<p>[spoiler]1. Upon arriving at the silo area, defeat all the aliens and enter the silo.<br>
2. After the scene where the tentacle drags the scientist away, continue on and into the room with the tentacles.<br>
3. The tentacle room has four levels. The entrance I’ll call Level 1. Level 2 is the first full platform and it has a closed door. Level 3 has the first open door. Level 4 is the floor of the silo room and has an open door.<br>
4. Go to Level 3 and go through the door to exit the tentacle room.<br>
5. There should be a door labeled “PROPLAB 02 - OXY/FUEL”. Open that door.<br>
6. Follow the corridors, defeating any enemies that might get in your way.<br>
7. There will be two elevator shafts without elevators, but water at the bottom.<br>
8. Jump down the elevator shafts into the water.<br>
9. Follow the pipe through the sewer to a ladder. Climb the ladder.<br>
10. You will come to a door marked “PROPLAB 04 - EXHAUST”. Go through this door.<br>
11. You will enter a silo with a giant fan at the bottom. Climb down the ladder to the fan.<br>
12. Go around the fan and there will be another ladder which will take you underneath the fan.<br>
13. Go underneath the fan and to the other side of the fan base. There will be a control panel there.<br>
14. SAVE YOUR GAME. This part might kill you.<br>
15. Flip the switch and quickly run around and climb the ladder before the fan blades can get turning too fast.<br>
16. When the fan blades are turning at top speed, it will allow you to fly up and reach vent shafts in the walls. Take any of the vent shafts; they will all lead to the same place.<br>
17. You will eventually end up in a control room with two red valves. One is broken, so you’ll need to find the valve wheel.<br>
18. Enter the control room and open the door at the far end. The valve wheel will be inside. Attach the valve wheel to the valve outside the control room.<br>
19. Turn both valve wheels to activate the oxygen and fuel lines.  <span class="bbcode-b">PART ONE COMPLETE!</span></p>
<ol start="20">
<li>
<p>This will open another door in the control room. Enter it and you’ll return to the silo area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to the tentacle room and go down to Level 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will probably have to destroy the boards in front of the door, but exit the tentacle room on Level 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will come to a door labeled “PROPLAB 03 - POWER”. Take this door.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the corridors and you’ll come to a silo with a pool of green glowing toxic waste at the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push the button on the wall to bring up a suspended elevator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the elevator and take it down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The elevator will stop and dangerous groaning metal sounds will be heard. Get out of the elevator! Jump to the ladder on the wall and take it down. The elevator will crash into the toxic waste below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll see a scientist tell you about Smithers going to turn on the generator but never coming back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the corridors and go through the airlock. You will enter another silo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go around to the other side of the silo and climb the ladder. There are two control rooms at the top, each with a button inside. You’ll need to activate both buttons to turn on the generator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With both buttons pressed, the generator should be on, and the fuel/oxygen lines should be running. <span class="bbcode-b"> PART TWO COMPLETE!</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return back the way you came to the tentacle room. Ascend to Level 1 and return to the control room where the tentacle dragged the scientist away in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “FIRE” button should now be lit green. The “FUEL” light should be lit red. The “OXYGEN” light should be lit blue and the “POWER” light should be lit green. If that’s all correct:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push the “FIRE” button and <span class="bbcode-b">light 'er up!</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way forward will be in the middle of Level 4 where the base of the tentacles were. ENJOY![/spoiler]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>EDIT: Wait, you say you’re playing a “different game”?  Can you take a screenshot of what you are playing so that we can see what you’re looking at?  Thanks!</p>

            <p>Yes, that gap and the pecker head tentacles are not a problem for me.<br>
Here is the real problem. I am playing a different game!!! I just watched a You Tube video of a walkthrough and it is very  different than the game I am playing.<br>
The one I am playing has no Silo 2 room. In my version there are no options between the tentacle silo and the elevator that eventually gets you to the generator.  There is just one elevator shaft instead of two and the bottom is a pool of green slime.<br>
The walkways in mine are plain cement. The walkways in the walkthrough are red and blue. It is obviously a very different version.  In the properties of my game it says:  <a>steam://rungameid/13540830642081628378</a>.<br>
Here is a link to the You Tube video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hGeTYbWppI" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hGeTYbWppI</a>  It looks to be like what everyone here is playing and talking about.<br>
Are there different versions of Black Mesa? Am I playing a mod? Where do I download the game everyone here is playing? I think I downloaded my game from Steam but it was a few days ago so I don’t really know.</p>

<p>There are two parts to this puzzle.  You turned on the generator, but you still need to activate the fuel line.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Where is the fuel line? I have already searched for hours for a new option, opening or path. At this point, I don’t need the reward of spending several more hours trying to find it on my own. I need the joy of moving on with my life.<br>
“If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.” <span class="bbcode-i">–Dr Emmett L. Brown</span>   It is obvious to me  that my 64 year old mind cannot accomplish everything. I’m ok with that because I am proud enough of my accomplishments. At this point, my mind  doesn’t want to go back and forth between the pit and the elevator another dozen times. Last night I went back to a previous chapter to start fresh and that didn’t help.  Would someone please just help me get past this misery.</p>

            <p>I turned on the generator and went back to the Control room but the Fire button in the control room is still red. I’ve read this thread twice and read and watched some walkthroughs but I can’t find anyway to make progress. When I am in the walkway on the lowest floor just outside the pit, the only option is jumping into the green slime of death. If I go back to the elevator shaft the elevator doesn’t come up. Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>When you’re in the corridors next to the blast pit (where the doors are through which you can see the tentacles) if you jump down to the lowest level, there’s a green pit which looks too wide to jump, but it has a little bit of grating on the side you can walk over. If you go in that direction, eventually you’ll descend to where the generator can be turned on.</p>

<p>Down through the hole in the floor where it was. You shouldn’t take any damage and there’s water right at the bottom.</p>
