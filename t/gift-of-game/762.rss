    <description>I was wondering, I currently have 2 extra copies of both HL2 and Ep1 that I can gift away via STEAM, is there anyone who might have an extra copy of L4D that they&#39;d want to trade for these extra copies?

Let&#39;s say 1 copy of both HL2 and Ep1 for 1 copy of L4D?</description>

            <p>Multiple accounts aren’t really weird. I have three.<br>
(Then again, one of them has no games and is only for updating a dedicated server. And my second account is limited to HL1 game keys that I inherited.)</p>
<p>A second account helps when you want to try a game with a non-Steam friend, to get them into your one true love of Half-Life and TFC. (OK, so it’s like one true love, except she has a twin and they’re both willing.)</p>

            <p>Yeah I know, I justed wanted to make clear that it was sort of a weird side effect of me buying the online version and later regretting not buying the retail version, that lead to me owning multiple copies. It’s not that I’m some mad collector of Half-Life games, who told you that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Anyway, it doesn’t look like anyone’s taking the bait so I’ll just wait untill L4D2 comes out, maybe they’ll cut the price on the original.</p>

            <p>Ever since I’ve gone off to college I’ve actually been living <a href="https://xkcd.com/606/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this comic</a>, so I should be getting and playing Episode 1 pretty soon.</p>
<p>So, sorry, no money or unwanted gifts here to be able to give Left 4 Dead. (I can’t really imagine why you’d have TWO <span class="bbcode-i">extras</span>, or why anyone would <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> an extra L4D without HL2/Ep1… I wish you luck.)</p>

<p>I was going to post “what on Earth do you need two copies of Team Fortress 2 for”, but then I remembered that I have two copies. Carry on, then.</p>

</aside>
<p>Because I’ve got two copies of the Orange Box, but they’re spread over my two accounts so it’s one copy of HL2/Ep1/Ep2/TF2/Portal on each account. And then I’ve also got the retail version of HL2 as well as the Collector’s Edition (one for each account), and both retail and online copies of Episode One (one for each account).</p>
<p>Weird thing is, I don’t remember why I even started a second STEAM account :lol:</p>

            <p>No, but I own the HL2 Collector’s Edition, the regular HL2 retail game, and both online and retail versions of Episode One and the Orange Box. They’re spread over my two accounts so I have an extra copy of HL2 and Ep1 in every account.</p>
<p>It’s pretty unlikely that anyone with a spare L4D game doesn’t yet have the HL2 games, but if there is then maybe we can both get a free game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
