<p>Metalheads (like myself) love this stuff. But the greater part of the public wants other music. I like metal, just not in trailers. If you could find a fitting fiddle to go with the images, and try to keep the images as clear as possible, than you have a nice video there. Try playing with your shots before you select a specific tune.</p>
<p>Again. I personally like the music and the weird psychedelic images you show. Though  the general public doesn’t.</p>

<p>It doesn’t suck because it has metal in it, it sucks because that song doesn’t go with Half-Life.</p>
<p>Just because (and I’m not saying that I like that particular song)  you put good music to a video doesn’t mean it was a good choice of music.</p>
<p>Something more Sci-Fi-ey should have been chosen.  I’m not just going to say techno cuz its maed wif de computars.  It should feel Sci-Fi,  you honestly would have been better off using a song out of the HL1/2 soundtrack or some of the already released Black Mesa music from their sound track.</p>

            <p>If you did that with Vegas it’s a pretty poor editing. I could have done that with Movie Maker  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>And… change the music so it fits to Half Life… the music you used doesn’t fit into the video at all.</p>
<p>Aaaaand it’s Half Life not BM.</p>
