    <title>[Question] Hammer - No AM Lab Doors</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/question-hammer-no-am-lab-doors/14413</link>
    <description>Hi everyone.
[b]I&#39;ve been looking for the generic lab doors (the ones that slide when you enter a lab in anomalous materials) for a while, but I can&#39;t seem to find it in the entity - model finder.[/b]

Also,[b] on another note[/b],  with the am_door1.mdl (bigger sliding doors when entering new areas in AM and other sciency areas), I put two of them side by side and rotated the other to &#39;lock in&#39; but I&#39;m not sure exactly how to make them both slide out. They don&#39;t do anything when I walk in them, and I&#39;ve made them both prop_dynamic.

I&#39;m new to this, so just figuring out these things. Thanks!</description>

            <p>Thanks guys. I learnt to start off orange-blocking after reading your dev post about gasworks.<br>
As for the map, it’s just a singleplayer test map, for myself really - to find out the right lighting, etc, to learn how to make a Black Mesa themed map for my future projects - whatever they may be.<br>
Thanks!</p>

            <p>Yeah, seems like a fairly solid start - you’ve got the right approach.</p>
<p>Not sure if you’re mapping for MP or SP, but if you’re mapping for MP, keep an eye out for making too many unreachable areas - in MP they often detract from the focus of the map rather than add to it, like they do in SP. My Gasworks devblog can give a bit of insight and information into the process (and mistakes!) of mapping for BMS MP, if you’re interested.</p>

            <p>It looks like you’ve got a good handle on the map development pipeline; that always gave me trouble, as I often skipped orangemapping entirely and wound up paying for it when things didn’t line up…</p>

<p>Indeed, it’s interesting to see how a lot of the ‘props’ are designed - most windows are really just blocks put together with textures and into a func_detail. Same with quite a lot of other stuff. It’s coming along, by the way:<br>
<a href="https://prntscr.com/8iu5wh" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://prntscr.com/8iu5wh</a><br>
(This is my first ‘test’ map. It’s just a generic science lab with an elevator (blocked off) and a door (blocked off) so I can learn how to make BM-style environments).</p>
<p>I also did an unreachable area behind the player spawn point with a curved hallway - I’m quite proud of it - and how simple it is to do!<br>
<a href="https://prntscr.com/8iu6j3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://prntscr.com/8iu6j3</a></p>
<p>Can’t wait to get this textured up and lit. But as for now, details and main structure.</p>
<p>Oh, and I learnt something important: <span class="bbcode-b">PUT ‘FRAMES’ AROUND YOUR STRUCTURES! </span>(eg. the elevator door)</p>

            <p>No need, Black Mesa includes all the source VMFs for SP.<br>
Also if one doesn’t understand func_doors and parenting, you need to read some documentation, otherwise decompiling will probably just confuse you.</p>

            <p>You have to give the func_door a name, then open the prop_dynamic’s properties, and in the parent box, put the name of your func_door. Objects essentially follow or mimic their parent’s movement. The invisible func_door does all the actual movement, I/O, etc., the prop_dynamic just follows it.</p>
<p>The generic lab doors are just func_doors with one of the <span class="bbcode-i">lab\labdoor</span> materials applied.</p>
<p>Also, instead of two triggers - one on each side - you can just use one that spans the length that both would. Not important, just a little cleaner.</p>

            <p>It’s not linked to a model, the doors are just flat rectangular brushes with the texture labdoor_00 or labdoor_00_open depending on whether you want them to look locked or not.</p>
<p>As for the big doors, the connection to the func_brush happens on the part of the prop_dynamic that you already have: putting the name of the invisible func_door in the prop’s “parent” field will cause the prop to follow that door.</p>

</aside>
<p>Ah, I see what you mean, mostly. I looked at the first AM map from BM and took a look at their doors. There’s a Trigger on both sides of the door to open when you walk to it, but also, like you said, an invisible block the same size of the door.<br>
However, creating a square brush, making it an entity, and selecting ‘func_door’ doesn’t do much. There isn’t a model selector or anything, so I’m still not sure how they linked it to that model. There’s only a ‘name’ area which seems to have the name of what would be a model. And for the generic lab doors I can’t find, I’m still not sure how to make them a func_door without being able to find it.</p>
