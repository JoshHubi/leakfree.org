    <description>So, a recent post in the Splinter Cell forums, posted by a community developer, said something very interesting about SC:C&#39;s multiplayer modes:

What the hell?! This is a TERRIBLE decision Ubisoft made! First they made Sam Fisher a furrie, now this?!

Oh well, the game looks awesome anyway, but this is still bullshit!

In the words of my Splinter Cell fanboy friend:
[i]&quot;Splinter Cell: Conviction Collectors Edition Xbox 360 Pre Order: CANCELED. Why would they do this!? SvM made Splinter Cell. Co-op did not! Damn it. Damn it.&quot;[/i]</description>

            <p>You obviously didn’t see many of the interviews. I was quite excited when they said it was going to be more stealth-based but it was practically the same except this time you didn’t have regenerating shields.</p>

            <p>ODST was never advertised as a stealth shooter. It was just a nice option Bungie added if you want to be Snake/Sam for a few brief moments between headshots <span class="bbcode-i">(at grunts specifically.)</span></p>

            <p>One thing I see these days in games is that developers say that their game is going to require/need/revolve around co-op/stealth/strategy but they never actually integrate what they want into the game.</p>
<p>Usually it isn’t even part of the game like H3:ODST was supposed to be more stealth based and it completely failed to be a stealth shooter it wanted to be. Occasionally you will see a game that does what they want perfectly, a good example of this is L4D it’s called a co-op game for a reason, it’s not just your buddy tagging along with you, you actually need to co-ordinate with your group and work together.</p>
<p>The mere fact that some games don’t manage to do what they want correctly makes me be skeptical whether SP:C will actually involve stealth as much.</p>

<p>Hahaha. Oh you. You’re just playing the game wrong.</p>
<p>It’s up to you on how you play the game. Personally, I play with as much stealth as possible. And guess what?: It works!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That is how I play it.</p>
<p>I am just saying it is alot more possible to ‘Run ‘N’ Gun’ than it was in the previous games. My friend started playing MGS4, not really caring for stealth.<br>
He ran out and I thought he was screwed, but he easily progressed. If you did that kind of shit in previous installments…</p>

            <p>I do like that concept of showing game objectives in game, it is much better alternative to a little floating box in the corner. Its ironic that you find that appealing, then love MGS4 which does everything possible to make sure all objectives are found in cutscenes, but I digress.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">Hold on, off-topic again:</span><br>
I think a developer has failed to me when their story doesn’t draw me in and enhance the urgency when the cutscene ends and I start playing again.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Splinter Cell <span class="bbcode-i">(hey look! We’re back on topic kind of!)</span> Splinter Cell’s gameplay is fun, but the game never really got me attached anything that was going on. I couldn’t help but laugh when that Japanese General felt “dishonored” by Sam foiling his plans for world domination <span class="bbcode-i">(or whatever)</span>, then sliced a sword through his chest. That was the most memorable part in any Splinter Cell game I played, but for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>When I started playing Metal Gear Solid 3 <span class="bbcode-i">(the first MGS game I played)</span>, I had the same feelings you had about the games. The cutscenes and Codec conversations were annoying and tedious as hell. And the story, at first, was just retarded. I kept playing just to see how crazier the game could get.</p>
<p>Then, sometime in the middle of the game, I started to care about what was going on. I started to like the characters. I found the stealth gameplay to be a fresh diversion from the mindless killing of, say, Halo, Call of Duty, Half-Life <span class="bbcode-i">(yes, I know Half-Life has a great story, but the gameplay is still shoot this, turn valve to open door, then shoot that. Not that there’s anything wrong with that.)</span> Even the crazy things in the game started to appeal to me.<br>
When I beat the game, I didn’t feel like I just finished watching a movie. I felt like I accomplished something <span class="bbcode-i">(which is a great feat for a <span class="bbcode-b">game</span>, since pressing buttons and moving the joystick in the right way isn’t exactly an “accomplishment” in the real world.)</span><br>
Of course, this is all just <span class="bbcode-i">“imo”</span> and nothing <span class="bbcode-i">(when it comes to trivial shit like this)</span> is a set in stone fact.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Which brings me back on topic:</span> I think Splinter Cell: Conviction will make me care about the story. The gameplay now has a unique style that sets it apart from other <span class="bbcode-i">“realistic”</span> stealth games. It’s obvious that Ubisoft is trying something new with storytelling, with their emphasis on using the environment to show objectives and flashbacks. Hell, I even heard they want to get rid of the loading screen.<br>
So who knows? Like I said, if it isn’t going to be Splinter Cell, it’s going to be something new and <a>i</a>[/i] great.</p>

            <p>I have no idea why I like Metal Gear Solid’s story so much. I know I should be disgusted at Kojima’s attempt at a video game narrative, yet it’s just so intriguing to me. The characters are likable, the plot twist come out of nowhere <span class="bbcode-i">(with none of that build up shit that makes you see it from a mile away)</span>, and, well, I like the <span class="bbcode-i">“little”</span> <span class="bbcode-i">(not the quotation marks as a sign of sarcasm)</span> gameplay <span class="bbcode-i">“bits”</span> <span class="bbcode-i">(there it is again)</span> you get for intermission between cutscenes.</p>
<p>Though I agree that calling something <span class="bbcode-i">“the best”</span> is just stupid <span class="bbcode-i">(even though I have been hailing MGS4 as “da bestest gam eva” even before I played it.)</span> All it does is attract haters and fat/ugly cosplayers.</p>

            <p>I personally think that the worst part of the game is the obscene amount of cutscenes. It is billed as having the best storytelling in gaming, but, in reality, it has the worst. A good developer does not make a bunch of movies and then string them along with game sections, a good developer makes a game, where everything is integrated. If you can know exactly what is going on (or as much as possible in the game, I don’t think anyone but Hideo understands that arm thing) from simply watching the cutscenes, the developer has failed to me. Not to mention most of the cutscenes are utter garbage and horrible writing. Hideo’s toilet “humor” is atrocious, he uses writing that in essence says “in order to escape your fate you must fulfill your destiny”, and most of the talking doesn’t need to be there.<br>
So ultimately my complaint about cutscene length is not necessarily that the cutscenes are long, although I can see no way that a good <span class="bbcode-b">game</span> story could have cutscenes that long, but its their content, namely the useless writing and stuff that should have been revealed in gameplay, you know, the whole playing the game part, that I find completely worthless.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow, thats a long rant. I needed that. Man I hate Hideo’s video games right now.</p>

            <p>Okay, please. Shut up. We get it. <span class="bbcode-i">“Oh haha! The cutscenes are long! Haha!”</span></p>
<p>Hey look! Actual gameplay!<br>

<p>Edit: I mean, you can bitch about how some plot elements are retarded <span class="bbcode-i">(ie, Liquid’s arm)</span>, the controls being just too damn ambitious for a PS3 controller <span class="bbcode-i">(but they work just fine imo)</span>, or even how the multiplayer is occasionally laggy. But no, you pick on cutscene length, for a game you never even played.<br>
Successful troll is successful, I guess.</p>

            <p>Hahaha. Oh you. You’re just playing the game wrong.</p>
<p>It’s up to you on how you play the game. Personally, I play with as much stealth as possible. And guess what?: It works!</p>

<p>Right, but you had a choice. In this one there doesn’t appear to be a choice, you have to kill to get by.</p>

<p>I fail to see how Spies vs. Mercs made Splinter Cell, as well. The first one didn’t have any form of multiplayer at all, and it’s my second favorite in the series, behind Chaos Theory, and even then I never played anything but the singleplayer campaign.</p>

            <p>Its true that the original Splinter Cell is no longer a unique game, as far as game play goes, but even so it would be nice to see that general style, with some alterations (not a complete overhaul) return in this game, and maybe then the studio could do the unthinkable and create a new series with this gameplay style.</p>
