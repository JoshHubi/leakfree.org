[quote]
Norwegian parliamentarian Snorre Valen said WikiLeaks was &quot;one of the most important contributors to freedom of speech and transparency&quot; in the 21st century. 

&quot;By disclosing information about corruption, human rights abuses and war crimes, WikiLeaks is a natural contender for the Nobel Peace Prize,&quot; Valen said.

<p>a revolution that deposes what is basically a totalitarian police state and puts a peaceful system of freedom in its place is a force for peace, I would say</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Perhaps, but the act itself is not peace. Not to mention there is an overwhelming probability that all that happens is another dictator and more violence.</p>
<p>Tiki, you do of course realize that I don’t see peace as this idealized notion. Inciting a revolution, while not creating peace, is a good thing. Its just not deserving of a prize for peace. But then again, a prize for creating peace is not necessarily something to brag about. In any case, the protesters of the middle east are not forces for peace. But this is a good thing. They reject the status quo, and further humanity because of it. Not to mention in egypt both sides are being equally violent, and each less violent than the military.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Someonerandm is an idiot.[/SIZE]</span></p>
<p>There, now thet that’s out of my system I can explain why it’s true.</p>
<p>Peaceful demonstrations often incur violence upon the demonstrator, when they’ve been that badly oppressed. Sitting in the front of a bus, demanding service at a discriminating bar, lying down in front of government vehicles… these are all things that could incite hideous violence upon the peace advocate.</p>
<p>But they’re peaceful people, <span class="bbcode-i">aren’t they?</span></p>
<p>Lighting someone on fire is an act of brutality, but when you incend yourself in a meditative trance, it’s considered peaceful because it’s in the name of peace, in the name of activism without intending harm to come to others. And sometimes, no matter how peaceful you are, you bring violence down upon bystanders. A whole crowd might be targeted with teargas and firehoses because someone put a flower in the barrel of a gun.</p>
<p>If riots happen because some government’s secrets got leaked, that government brought it upon themselves. They are not some bystander, but a perpetrator. I’m sure many peace-prize advocates caused indirect violence when their crackdown on crime led to police standoffs.</p>

            <p>everybody has secrets that other people don’t necessarily want to hear about, but we all want to know about government mess-ups, because we trust our lives into it, we make it our way of life, if the government messups get really bad, anarchy becomes a better solution</p>

            <p>refering to nietzschesaurus(partly):<br>
oh yeah the government shouldn´t have any secrets, right? what about we all shouldn´t have secrets? sounds great for me…<br>
honestly, if everyone would know everything about a government, diplomacy would be impossible, leading to anarchy and neverending war(because war is the alternative to diplomacy). politics are complex and even if you could see what politicians do, you wouldn´t be able to judge right because you can never know all the facts and circumstances the way someone involved does. also, people tend to not think before saying or writing something. if all the information governements hold would be realeased every idiot would tear every sentence from politicians out of context, which would rather fast lead to more chaos than is here already.<br>
i´m myself not quite sure of this but i´ll go as far as saying that some secrets can safe lifes.</p>
<p>i like the trend that this “evil deeds” are covered up. but i also heard that assange released some names of informants, who are thus in danger even though his staff was against that and the names were basicly completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>some secrets should be uncovered, and some should stay secret, for people´s sake.</p>

<p>True. He was elected because everybody thought he would (in the future) change American policy and promote peace throughout the world. And thanks to the Nobel prize, help him in this task. I guess they were overenthusiastic 'bout him.</p>

<p>As to wikileaks, all it has done is idealized truth at the cost of peace. Lying is integral to maintaining peace, since if people actually knew what we though of them there’d be a lot more wars.</p>

<p>I totally agree with you here.</p>

<p>I thought it was a guy who burned himself because of the disastrous economic and social life in Tunisia. Wikileaks just gave munitions to confirm that Ben Ali and his wife clan are greedy bastards.</p>
