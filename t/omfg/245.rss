<p>Yeah, am I the only person who enjoyed thief 3 in the slightest? I loved the game mechanics and the controls and gameplay was quite smooth. I also found the 3rd person perspective option to be incredibly helpful, sorta like training wheels for going from 3rd person perspective to 1st person perspective. Don’t even try to deny the awesome mind trip that is Cradle.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The main problem people had is that it deviated too much from the Thief series in terms of gameplay (for example, the climbing gloves instead of the rope arrow). It also suffered a lot from the console-ification of the game (see the tiny city levels, for example). The engine was crap (ragdolls anyone?) and ran like treacle on even high-end hardware, although this isn’t such a problem now.</p>
<p>Basically, Deadly Shadows was a very good game, it just had some niggly annoyances which stopped it from being <em>quite</em> as good as Thief 2.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I still haven’t yet played Thief 1 &amp; 2, but I have them, so it’s just a matter of getting my controls set up, but I still don’t see how thief 2 will be that much better. A lot of the complaints about thief 3 were things I specifically enjoyed about the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’ll find that Thief 2 is graphically fairly primitive by current standard, but everything else about the game is spot on IMO. Thief 1 shows its age even more but it’s still pretty awesome. One thing I will say is, play them in order. Certain bits of The Metal Age will make more sense if you play The Dark Project first.</p>
<p>Warning, following paragraph (in italics) contains minor spoiler.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">That’s a point, actually… Thief 1 was all about the Pagans upsetting the balance, Thief 2 was all about the Mechanists doing same, and Thief 3 was all about the Keepers themselves losing it. What’s the story going to be in Thief 4? Should be interesting to find out!</span></p>

<p>And I cannot in the slightest figure out how Thief = Thi4f. The only way I could have seen that working was if they called the 3rd thief game “Thi3f” in which case it could actually work pretty well.</p>

<p>Fixed, sorry 'bout that.</p>
<p>Edit: hmm, seems editing the post title doesn’t change the thread title. Bugger.</p>

            <p>I have a bit of information about this thanks to PCGamer UK:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>What they don’t know is The Spy has prior knowledge of the direction Thief was meant to be taken a few years ago, when a new Thief game was mooted behind closed doors. The Spy learned this new game will be set in the near future or present, and they were considering moving away from the idea of the main character, well, thieving. That was a long time ago, happily, and things have undoubtedly changed, because such an idea couldn’t exist long without the hot, acid breath of scorn melting it to goo. Note to Eidos: if you dare remove Thief from the steampunk fusion world Garrett inhabits and take away the stealing, The Spy will hunt you down.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This was published before the name Thi4f was revealed, but the name appears to support the idea of a modern or future setting.</p>

            <p>I hope they do right by the series.  For some odd reason, I have a feeling that there’s going to be some serious Assassin’s Creed influence in this installment.</p>
