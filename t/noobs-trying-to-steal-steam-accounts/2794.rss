My Firefox browser addon wot underlines the link as untrusted, is there anyway to keep noobs from sending me these emails? :brow: Edit: I just cheeked the link, with another computer, and the link is blocked by Firefox by default.</description>

            <p>I didn’t get a chance to report him, but I did report the link as a web forgery to Mozilla Firefox. Sadly though I deleted the message. Also the user is a fail troll.</p>

            <p>I think coldroll is talking about his EMAIL not his Private messages. My advice is this, Ignore It. Oh and you probably were asked by a specific user to be the admin of his servers no? you wanna report this user.<br>
I’m saying this from EXPERIENCE.</p>
