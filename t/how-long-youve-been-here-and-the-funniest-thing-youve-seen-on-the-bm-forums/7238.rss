    <description>Hey, I&#39;ve been hanging around here for a year now and I&#39;ve seen references to all kinds of entertaining sounding stories from the older members. Post how long you&#39;ve been on the forums and the funniest thing you&#39;ve seen here. Examples, Swampfox, something Eric did (idk he sounds like a funny guy  :slight_smile: ), etc.</description>

            <p>I’ve lurked around this forums since 06-07, registered in 08. remember the xen art community project, not anything interesting like that any longer on the forums, mostly just “when will it be done” and “what will you do when it is released”, at last it seems there are no more questions about helmets, mirrors and casseroles <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Think I first joined a forum waaay back in about 2005, then I sort of forgot about it, checking in occasionally when I remembered it. Then came back on a more permanent basis last year.</p>
<p>Swampfox was mildly amusing.</p>

<p>Yeah, Danny Smith even requested to have me banned… permanent.</p>

            <p>I joined many moons ago.</p>
<p>Funniest was probably the source comics on leak-free, the ram ‘n’ jam stuff, 3vil, hotnumbers, BlackOps and his manifesto (still have a copy of it somewhere at home) and so many other things.</p>

            <p>I’ve been around these forums since the very first iteration - the one right after Black Mesa split from LeakFree. (Five years ago? Six? Hell if I know.)</p>
<p>And the funniest thing I’ve ever seen on these forums - hands down - was the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=45&amp;highlight=GORDON" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">“GORDON”</a> thread.</p>
