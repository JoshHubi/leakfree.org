    <title>Game crashes while loading recent saved games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-while-loading-recent-saved-games/63319</link>
    <description>Game worked like a charm until the boss fight in surface tension. From then on all my save points, both autosave and manual ones, won&#39;t load. It starts loading then crashes. Everytime. I tried restarting game, PC, ran on potato graphic settings. Validated game files in steam. None helped. My specs are more than enough to run this game on highest quality.

I am not willing to restart the whole chapter anew, no time.

Pls kindly help.</description>
