            <p>Always run is borked right now, disable it.<br>
To fix the hand issue, you’ll have to start a new game from the chapter you were in. The update made some changes (of course) and Source doesn’t play nicely with old saves.</p>

Anyway, I am having this same issue since the update. I am in Residue Processing and Gordon has the same hands in OP’s pic but also has perma-run, and there is no way to take it off.

<p>Actually im having a problem with auto-run too, Now before you get on my arse about auto-run, here is the other problem. My game freezes when I click on the options tab, I have no idea why it just does so for now im stuck with auto-run and I can’t use HEV Chargers. (I suspect that it may be trying to heal me seeing as how other people are getting that glitch.)</p>

            <p>I dunno if it’d do anything, but on a hunch here - after starting the game, type disconnect in the console (the animated background counts as an in-game level/session), then “maxplayers 1” before loading the game. The way it’s got autorun and the MP viewmodel hands kinda makes me think it’s loading the save in multiplayer mode somehow, but…</p>

            <p>I also had this bug.<br>
I started a new save file too and no worries.<br>
But something i also noticed is that the little weapons menu  that appears on the HUD when you switch your weapons with binds or scrolling just disappeared.<br>
I can still scroll or change my weps. But no menu, neither the sounds that come with switching weapons.</p>
<p>Am i the only one?</p>
<p><em>EDIT</em><br>
The game enabled the Fast Weapon Switch after the update for me and because of it i couldn’t see the weapons menu on the UI.<br>
Sorry. I’m just really dumb.</p>
