    <description>Gordon moves the Handle on the neck of the weapon

what does this do?

perhaps make a way to indicate what firing mode you&#39;re using, make the screen change colors?</description>

            <p>Is there like an addon (with extra files) for either Black Mesa or the original Half-Life that can add that cut firing mode to the Gluon Gun to make that handle useful? I hope that there’s at least 1 Half-Life fan that was creative enough to create an addon like that.</p>

            <p>Both the Snarks and the Trip Mines are excellent ideas, actually, and I wouldn’t have thought of either. Funny thing is, Source may already have mechanics for both. “Marking” with the Snarks could work the same as the Bug Bait, which I think is just an AI call, but I could be wrong. And Hoppers from Half-Life 2 work on a similar principle to proximity mines, they just jump when they’re triggered instead of exploding straight away.</p>
<p>And, yeah, just having the game play a small animation on right-click for weapons that don’t have a function would be nice.</p>

            <p>The thing about the old  rapid fire mode in HL1 is that it is rendered moot by being able to fire as fast as your finger can click in BM. It wouldn’t really serve purpose. I guess something like the gluon gun where your see a small animation would be okay instead. I always thought it would be neat to have the alternate fire for tripmines be a proximity mine. Instead of the beam, make it a blinking red light, and if something gets within a small radius ( even not in direct line of the actual mine ) then they go boom. It would make them a bit more useful. It would be funny to have the alt fire for snarks as a marking beacon. alt fire and the snark explodes and marks the enemy. All subsequent snarks then follow that specific target. That would make them a bit more useful. I’m okay with no alt function of the crowbar.</p>
<p>Edit: This is all just kind of pie in the sky stuff though.</p>

<p>So I did… Wow, I honestly thought I’d said the whole thing I was thinking. Fail on my part, big time. Sorry about that. Should have read my own post before posting in all-caps.</p>
<p>I mean to say that the game needs more alt fires not just to the Gluon Gun, but to all weapons in general. Of course, the ones that already have them don’t need to be messed with, but there are quite a few that don’t, and it’s actually kind of disappointing. “Iron Sights” just don’t strike me as a good enough alt fire for the magnum - and yes, I’m aware it has a sniper scope in multiplayer. I always found that to be very weird.</p>
<p>I do miss the secondary fire on the pistol, though. Did in Half-Life 2, as well. I don’t want to mess with gun balance, but I do want to see at least something happen when you press alt fire. I keep thinking back to the old UT vs. Q3 arguments, where one of the big things going for UT was all weapons had two firing modes. And I like that, even if it didn’t always make sense.</p>

<p>Or the … of the 9mm pistol, or the … of the magnum, or the … of the crowbar, or the … of the snarks. I said more alt-fire modes FOR WEAPONS THAT DON’T HAVE THEM. You pretty much listed all the weapons that do and ignored the ones that don’t.</p>
<p>Also, I do appreciate the grenade underhand toss, and greatly, but you could always toss out more than one satchel charge. Right click tosses them, left click detonates them, except when you haven’t thrown any, in which case both buttons toss them. I do appreciate seeing both the satchel hand AND the detonator hand in the same shot, though. As well, the Hive Hand always had two firing modes, nothing new about that.</p>

<p>As for the Gluon Gun, it’d have been nice to swap fire modes, but I don’t mind the alt fire just juggling the handle. It adds a bit of flair to the weapon. I actually wish all weapons that don’t have an alt fire mode (as well as the ones that have iron sights when that’s turned off) would do a small animation when the right mouse button is pressed. The 9mm could have Gordon pull the slide to see if there’s a round in the chamber, the magnum could have him spin the drum, Russian Roulette style. That sort of thing.</p>

            <p>at the moment, this does nothing but move the handle. Originally the gauss gun was supposed to have 2 firing modes, wide and thin and the handle was supposed to change between the modes. In the original half life this was cut and didn’t do anything but move the handle. in Black Mesa this is consistent and doesn’t do anything but move the handle.</p>
