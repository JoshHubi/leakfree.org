    <title>Computer Advice for HL2:EP2 (BM)?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-advice-for-hl2-ep2-bm/1224</link>
    <description>Hello!  I&#39;ve searched the forums and couldn&#39;t find a topic for this so...

According to my research, Black Mesa will have the same basic requirements as Half Life 2: Episode 2.  I&#39;m in the market for a desktop computer (not just for BM, but it&#39;ll be a reason).

My question:  What do y&#39;all suggest I look for in a computer for a quality gaming experience (in HL2 and BM) that isn&#39;t going to break the bank?  What&#39;s the most important thing to look at?  Video card?  Processor speed and number? Memory?  Brand names?  

In the past, I&#39;ve always just kind of winged it and have always been disappointed with my purchases, which is, admittedly, pretty dumb.  So I&#39;m now looking for advice.

What do you recommend I look for?   Thanks everyone, in advance!</description>

<p>and there in lies the problem with the free version - it skips the rail-requirement calculation.  (At least it did last I checked.  Still good for a baseline approximation tho.)</p>

</aside>
<p>When it comes to hardware, the majority of the time, the more you spend, the better quality the hardware is. In each wattage, there’ll probably be a $20-$60 difference (those are estimations, I never actually compared). Even the high end PSUs can be crappy, like what paddy said, even if you did spend a lot on wattage.</p>
<p>This doesn’t always apply though, monster cables are generally equal or similar quality to the cables that are $80 less, so paying more doesn’t always mean it’s better.</p>

            <p>Ya it’s more amps that can cause limitations these days (not a problem with the PSU suggested BTW ) . Some cheaper power supplies aren’t able to provide nearly what they claim either. a no name 400W PSU I wouldn’t push much further than 200W. There is always noisy power, or ripply in primary 12, and 5v connections that can damage hardware.</p>

            <p>there isn’t really anything wrong with the parts selected. I do have a couple notes however. The motherboard is okay, but I might suggest the extra couple bucks for the full P45 chipset instead. Try locating one without the primary power connector in the very center of the board, because that is a huge pain in the ass. Try the MSI P45 neo-f instead, about the same price, but the power connectors is on the edge, and the full P45 chipset for added features.</p>
<p>Hard drive is good, ram is fine, case is okay ( I like more space, bit that will do ), CPU is okay, I would suggest the 4850 as those extra few bucks go a long way towards performance. I do like the specific model suggested because of the cooler that excahusts out of the case. XFX also has great warranty policies.</p>
<p>The power supply is overkill. That system will draw less than 300W at full load. That TX750 can power two 4890s no problem.</p>

            <p>Ok, so then you should definitely build your own. Hasn’t changed too much.<br>
You could also build an i7 rig, but it depends on how much you want to spend, how much performance you need, and how long you want it to last. With i7 you’d obviously need a new mobo and ram.</p>
<p>On a side note, I have no idea if that power supply is even remotely adequate. If someone could explain how rails and wattage and all that works with computers that would be great.</p>

            <p>I guess I should’ve noted that I’ve built computers in the past (though I’ve never actually purchased a mobo and processor that needed thermal paste or anything for the processor; the last computer I’ve built like this was a single-core Pentium 2 where you just stick the heatsink and fan on top of the processor and clamp it down).</p>
<p>I do know my way through a computer and have troubleshooted them in the past (will have to look at how to apply thermal paste if I am going to buy everything separately; my last purchase was a barebones system with the assembly already done for me…and it died just a short while later – the computer just kept shutting off*).</p>
<p>Thank you for your recommendations!  I will use these as a guide and for anyone else that chimes in, too.  Thanks again!</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried everything I could think of to stop the computer from shutting off – the thing would work for a bit and then suddenly power down.  I even switched out the power supply.  No dice.  I think the motherboard was busted.  :’(</li>

            <p>Build it yourself. Cheaper with higher quality parts, and it’s much, much easier than you would think. Plus you will know how your computer works so you can fix it if you ever need to.</p>
<p>Basically, I would recommend a Core 2 duo, like this one. Includes a heatsink and fan, you might want to upgrade the stock fan if you’re doing serious overclocking, which I doubt. $110<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115206&amp;Tpk=core%202%20duo%20e7400" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115206&amp;Tpk=core%202%20duo%20e7400</a></p>
<p>Get a good, at least 500w power supply like this one. $90<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139004" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139004</a></p>
<p>This case is simple, cheap, and high-quality. Very good reputation. Includes 2 fans, you can add more if needed (again, only really if you’re doing serious overclocking). $60<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129042" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811129042</a></p>
<p>An ATI radeon 4670 will play any source game at &gt;60 fps assuming your processor is good enough, I get about 60 and my processor sucks. You can upgrade this if you want to, your mobo will probably have 2-3 pci-e slots on it so you can get more than one. A 4670 is kind of mid-range, there are other people here who can give you more information if you need it. Basically it’s just a lot of bang for your buck. If you want to spend a little bit more, 2 4850s in crossfire (basically the 2+ cards are connected as one) have a good price/performance ratio.<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102820" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102820</a> - 4670 - $65<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150337" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150337</a> - 4850 - $110 (each)</p>
<p>RAM you want probably 4 gigs, especially if you get Vista (nowhere near as bad as people say, loads of people here use it) and you can probably get a free upgrade to windows 7 with it. $52<br>
This 4gb kit is pretty decent:<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231122" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231122</a></p>
<p>Harddrive is really up to you how much space you need, unless you download lots of porn, games, or have a crapload of flac music 500gb is probably all you need to start. HDD upgrades are incredibly easy to do yourself. SATA is newer &amp; faster than IDE.<br>
something like this is fine. $65<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136319" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136319</a></p>
<p>Disk drive, a lot of people only get one, I like having two to copy discs, but oh well. Cheap and easy to upgrade. Even easier than harddrives, because you don’t have to format them first (windows install does this for you). Again, SATA. $27<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827151187" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827151187</a></p>
<p>And the mobo - ties everything together. Depends on your cpu and to an extent ram, this one works with the examples I gave. $95<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131393" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157143</a></p>
<p>and cables for the hdd/dvd drive(s) - make sure they’re the right kind for the given drives. $2 each<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812123111" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812123111</a></p>
<p>If you go the crossfire route with the gpus, then you need a crossfire bridge. this one’s good. $7<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814998002" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814998002</a></p>
<p>hope I haven’t forgotten anything, this would be a fully functioning comp if you bought the parts specified. Much cheaper and higher quality than anything made for you, unless you paid tons of $$ for it.</p>
<p>I assume you already have a monitor/mouse/keyboard, if not you can choose those on your own.</p>
<p>The cost for it (this is subject to change, you may find that it goes down) is roughly $730 US, with the 2 4850s in crossfire and one hdd, one dvd drive. Not bad for a box that’ll last you for a good while. And someone’s going to come along and pick this apart with links for a much better configuration.</p>
<p>I’ve edited this a lot in the 15 min since I first posted, just fyi.</p>

            <p>Hello!  I’ve searched the forums and couldn’t find a topic for this so…</p>
<p>According to my research, Black Mesa will have the same basic requirements as Half Life 2: Episode 2.  I’m in the market for a desktop computer (not just for BM, but it’ll be a reason).</p>
<p>My question:  What do y’all suggest I look for in a computer for a quality gaming experience (in HL2 and BM) that isn’t going to break the bank?  What’s the most important thing to look at?  Video card?  Processor speed and number? Memory?  Brand names?</p>
<p>In the past, I’ve always just kind of winged it and have always been disappointed with my purchases, which is, admittedly, pretty dumb.  So I’m now looking for advice.</p>
<p>What do you recommend I look for?   Thanks everyone, in advance!</p>
