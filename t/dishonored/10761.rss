    <description>I don&#39;t usually buy games, infact, to be honest, this particuliar game &quot;Dishonored&quot; in terms of just gameplay doesnt really interest me at all. Though I have read that its meant to be very innovative and open like the original Deus-Ex.

But the reason Ill be buying it is for the art direction, it is soooooo good. Anyone else psyched for the game?</description>

<p>Hasn’t everyone been raving about how immersive the game is, and how you can spend so much time just exploring? Wouldn’t that mean that the ending isn’t really part of the key draw?</p>

</aside>
<p>No, it isn’t. And neither is the main plot. But it is true that both of those things are a little underwhelming.</p>
<p>Still probably my favorite game of the year though.</p>

            <p>Did you guys have the Low Chaos or the High Chaos endings? They are both a little underwhelming but especially the Low chaos one.</p>

            <p>Just finished the game without alerting or killing anyone. It wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be. As long as you’re aware of your surroundings, you can find a route that bypasses everything.</p>
<p>The only exception being when you have to climb up that giant-ass bridge.</p>

<p>How did you get through it?</p>
<p>I looked in absolutely every nook and cranny in that mansion. I found it to certainly change the pace of the game in a good way. For me it gave it more of an RPG interlude. Being able to sign the guest book was a nice touch, especially as you can read a letter in a later level that discusses it.</p>
<p>Can’t wait to go through that level on my next play through, I’m going to ‘crash’ that party much more severely.</p>

<p>Didn’t even really use any supernatural skills other than blink and dark vision. Next run I’ll probably be playing around with possession and bend time a lot more.</p>

<p>I remember one of the devs talking about that before release, and they were kinda just like “yeah, work with us here a little, lean is useless if the AI sees you when you do it.”</p>

</aside>
<p>I can hold my sense of disbelief in regards to the leaning. It’s very hard to pull off peeking around corners realistically to the point where I can only remember the Crysis games doing it well.</p>
<p>Thinking about the genre, or sub-genre, or sub-sub-genre, Where is all the coal? I’d say it counts as a post steampunk world if whale oil is an improvement over coal in the universe. I’ve noticed some smoke towers, so I assume it’s is about.</p>
<p>Regardless, AWESOME game. I’ve been playing the first time through doing everything how I want. The second time I intend to slaughter absolutely everything in my path as I haven’t seen too much combat this time. Then I’l go super stealth.</p>

            <p>I wonder if it’s ingrained into the AI that they can’t see you when leaning or if it just happens that way due to how the AI functions. I think it was that way in Thief though because I don’t know if I’ve ever been seen in that game while leaning. Because I’ve heard a lot of people say that the guards don’t look up and can’t spot you when you’re on a somewhat high ledge but I get spotted all the time when on a ledge as long as I’m not in shadows.</p>

<p>Best game I’ve played in literally years. Anyone who likes Deus Ex like gameplay and is willing to take on steampunk ( never been much of a fan ) I can’t recommend it enough.</p>
<p>If they were to make a second ( haven’t finished yet ) I’d suggest more indepth interaction with NPCs.</p>

<p>If you ask me, it is more of the “Clockpunk” looking at the theme.</p>
<p>There are no steam at all, only whale oil</p>

            <p>Again I agree, all the things you listed are fine reasons to play the game. And as I stated several times already, I recommend the game as well. And When I say it’s fun to play, many of those reasons you listed factor into my definition of ‘fun’.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I particularly enjoyed the setting and art design. Just for the record.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
