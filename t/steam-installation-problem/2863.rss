    <title>Steam Installation Problem.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-installation-problem/2863</link>
    <description>Hi guys, not sure why this is happening, but I&#39;ve tried to install steam, and it originally was on my External HDD, and I don&#39;t have that anymore, and so I wanted to install it on my Internal HDD, and I tried to, but it came up with this error:

&quot;Error 1327. Invalid Drive F:\&quot;
&quot;Installation ended prematurely because of an error&quot;

I&#39;ve tried several things, but it just wants to install on Drive F, which doesn&#39;t exist anymore, it was my External HDD, but it just won&#39;t do anything else.

This is when I start the installation up, at the Preparing to install window, and the Computing Space Requirements window.

Does anyone know of some command line or something to force it to install on the original Drive C?

Thanks guys.</description>
