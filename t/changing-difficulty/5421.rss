    <description>Is there a command to change difficulty on half-life through console or another way, but not by starting to play game from beginning?

P.S. Fixed the problem - automatic aim at enemies - it can be turned off in options</description>

            <p>Right before you’re about to go to the next map (if you haven’t been there before)<br>
skill #<br>
The number is between 1 and 3, 1 being easy, 2 being medium, and 3 being sausagefest.<br>
When you change over to the new map, it SHOULD change the difficulty.  To check, type “skill” into the console, and if it gives you the same number you entered before, it worked.  If it gives the number corresponding to the one it was already at, then it didn’t and yea you’ll probably have to just start over.</p>

            <p>Can’t you just change the difficulty in the options and restart?</p>
