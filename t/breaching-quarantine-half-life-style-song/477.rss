    <title>Breaching Quarantine (Half-Life style song)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/breaching-quarantine-half-life-style-song/477</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I recently came here to check how the mod was doing and I stumbled on the music community project and it inspired me to make my own (especially &quot;the year of death&quot;)!

Unfortunately I&#39;d already missed the contest by the time I found it, but I thought I may as well link you guys in case anyone was interested.

I&#39;d love to hear what any of you think  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>It is good, but the instruments joining in at around 0:55 feel out of place, and it just seems to wander from there. As for the length, It’s longer then 21 out of the 27 songs that were in HL, so it’s a good length.</p>
