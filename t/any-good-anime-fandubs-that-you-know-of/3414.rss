            <p>I don’t understand why someone would want to do a fandub. I mean, maybe if its a bad dub or never got one, but could you really get enough people? Then, can you get enough <span class="bbcode-i">talented</span> people? And then, can you get enough talented people who sound older than 14? If you can, are you gonna pay them? Otherwise, are they all really bored, really good friends, or owe you tremendous debts? If so, do they all have enough free time to record for days or even weeks? And, supposing the answer to all the previous questions was yes, do you have a place to record and good equipment, or is it going to be recorded on a $15 headset? AND. Supposing you had all this - why are you doing a fandub and not the official dub?!</p>
<p>Seriously though, when you consider the logistics, any hope of finding a good one kind of fades away.</p>
