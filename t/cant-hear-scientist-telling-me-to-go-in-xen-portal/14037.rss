    <title>Can&#39;t Hear Scientist Telling Me to Go in Xen Portal</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-hear-scientist-telling-me-to-go-in-xen-portal/14037</link>
    <description>In the end of the Lambda Core chapter, you&#39;re supposed to hear the scientist telling you to get in the Xen portal. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t hear him giving me the OK due to the aliens attacking. Good thing I had captions on to be aware of this. Please make him loud enough for everyone to hear him when he gives the OK.</description>
