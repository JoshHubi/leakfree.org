    <title>Running Steam Through an External Hard Drive</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/running-steam-through-an-external-hard-drive/3004</link>
    <description>Recently, in an effort to save space on my laptop&#39;s hard drive, I decided to reinstall Steam, and all of my Steam games onto an external hard drive. Steam works fine, but I&#39;m unable to get certain games to run (like all except for HL1). 

Does anyone know if it is possible to fix this problem, or should I just try reinstalling Steam normally.</description>

            <p>My brother also has his Steam games all installed in his external HDD, and I’m pretty sure he did it by copy-pasting.</p>
<p>Who knew.</p>

            <p>Odd i have all my Steam games backed up on an external and I can run them fine from it. Maybe try copying the steam folder directly from your c drive onto it thats how I did it.</p>
