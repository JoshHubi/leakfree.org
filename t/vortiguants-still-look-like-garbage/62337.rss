Inb4 &quot;it looks fine, I was born with chronic glaucoma&quot; 

Can we just like finally get a visual update on the god damn slave-gear for the Vortigaunts? The gear on them is ancient and then ancient again for crying out loud. It&#39;s not even in the final HL2 for more than a split second because it&#39;s not even up to par with a game from 2004. Moreover, the Combine are the ones big on reproduction control, so just mindlessly bringing over the crotch plate kills any possible logic toward the separate motives of the foes you come up against in both games. It really looks mad ugly which is why none of these things can be forgiven.

I&#39;m also not a fan of the &quot;evolution-based&quot; decision to fuck with the eyes on the bullsquid. The model you had before was fine. An amphibious creature that lives in a dimension where things float the hell around can have any fish-like eye structure it wants. The reasons behind the decisions to give the bullsquid alligator eyes makes me want to punch children. They look like DOOM enemies with their big silly lovecraft faces coming at me, both eyes on me like it&#39;s a face on legs. But I mean... at least that&#39;s not rocking 20 year old textures.

Also fortunate that the workshop has models like this to accustom people like me on that, but I mean, who the hell wants anything but Half Life in their Half Life?!![dasgfdg|404x305](upload://b16IkP4RiRvR86qqphBknNq4W1C.jpeg)</description>

            <p>I honestly don’t get all the hostility and… Passionate opinions on how the Collective did the Xenians. They felt like a natural evolution of the style to me, when looking at how Valve changed the headcrabs, barnacles, and icthyosaur in Half-Life 2. Darker, meatier, more alien-looking. I also figured the changed slave armor was just that, a change in aesthetic design, not meant to actually be different armor. Just works, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If we were to get redesigned Xenians though, I’d like to see the main body of the Vortigaunt updated to more closely match what we saw in Half-Life: Alyx.</p>
<p>As far as Braindead’s models, they’re good for what they’re meant to be, but in my opinion they just look too cartoony to match Black Mesa’s style. Especially their bullsquid. But that’s basically just a texture issue.</p>
<p>But I do agree that the slave armor looks a bit dated, even with how it’s been edited for Black Mesa. Hit me with Braindead’s slave armor (with toned-down colors, way too saturated to fit in BM on its own) on Alyx’s vortigaunt model.</p>

            <p>Sorry but that guy “Braindead” who does all the classic npc mods… Surely a no brainer to bring him onboard.</p>
<p>It is a clear gap in Black Mesa Skillset and they have never really updated hardly any npc’s from half life enhanced mod.</p>
<p>Not complaining but they need somone who can improve on the alien npc’s across the roster and perhaps be able to make decent looking new ones if needed.</p>

            <p>Really?  I thought the Office Complex announcement system lines were cut from the map, so while they were still in the game files they didn’t play anywhere.  I remember a developer saying they didn’t want to overwhelm players with the announcement system or something.</p>
<p>I’d honestly really like it if they added them back in…</p>

            <p>God, this brings me back to what this forum was like over 10 years ago. People arguing about how to interpret half life’s vague 90s bullshit, and how incorrect these fan’s interpretation is compared to these other fans.</p>
<p>Go back to 2009.</p>
<p>I briefly came back to the forum to see how the community had evolved, this is a huge fucking regression.</p>

            <p>Oh I know, I keep his whole soundtrack on my command bar. There’s also mods that bring his work back into the game. Workshop is seriously my favorite place to spice up Black Mesa and make it more Half Life-y. It actually has made me appreciate how much they did right, Black Mesa.</p>
<p>I think the game now with the workshop and Xen is probably going to steal me hours from me than Half Life 2 did, which is quite something to me.</p>

            <p>Well TECHNICALLY… my voice is heard throughout the office complex over the announcement system. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> So you have ever reason to keep going! Originally I was also heard as the female assassins grunting as they fell or got shot, but someone made a comment that they sounded too ‘sexual’ (me: wtf?) so they got someone else to do the hits and grunts and had them do them softer. :shrug:imnothurt:much:</p>
<p>Anyway. I can appreciate your desire to see things to perfection, and I can agree with it too. Believe it or not (please no one shoot me!) there are a few things about BM that I personally do not care for that I think they missed the boat on too. I am not going to go into it, but because of those pieces, I personally feel HL original is better. (shock!amazeballs!gasp!) In the end, it is these types of discussions that makes this community spicy and fun. We all have our own preferences of how things should look, feel, taste like, and when you love something as much as we do, you get rather frustrated when it takes a turn in a different direction. Creatively or otherwise.  :shrug: It isnt my project tho. That is what I have to keep telling myself. Things that are important to ME, may not be top priority to the creators. Then again, maybe what <em>I</em> like, they think is shoddy.</p>
<p>We all have to appreciate what they offer and make peace with the fact that they don’t always creatively focus on things we would.</p>
<p><em>“I mean, besides the fact that I have to listen to Kelly Bailey while playing,”</em>  huh? Kelly Bailey is NOT anywhere in our game.</p>

            <p>Catz, maybe you can help me? I can’t get passed Inbound because once your voice stops, I don’t want to play anymore. Any tips? &lt;3</p>
<p>Anyways, they still look a lot worse than most things fans are putting out right now in the workshop. I’d almost forgive it if they just lined up the model to the wrists better and took away the crotch plate. Everything else is pretty acceptable after the updates.</p>
<p>But with all the rinkydink stuff in Xen, it really would be cool to see it get updated with one of the newer Xen looking models we’ll be seeing. For instance, there’s this pic going around of a chrome texture on the Black Mesa Nihilanth model’s seat-thing and it looks fucking spooky seeing all the details the devs added. I’d love to see something similiar on the vorts, maybe armor that looks more painful or something – anything but a near direct copy of HL2.</p>

<p>JFC I mean, it’s nice and all that the same 2 people feel the need to remind me they disagree with me here, but if you look for it, it’s not like just my complaint. You don’t have to badger me with “well okay but that’s not nice”. SoSrybruh. Yeah nobody feels as strongly about it as I do, but so what? People love Black Mesa (including myself, I have hours logged like crazy probably), but there’s always been one or two tedious little complaints about this mod, (people usually talk shit on HECU or whatever, which I can see sometimes) but one of which I always stood by 100% was that the Vortiguants didn’t get the attention they deserved perhaps.</p>
<p>And most of that is <strong>being solved</strong> apparently in this new AI update with Xen, so there you go. I’m just asking for maybe an updated reskin and people are saying I’m petty cause I made a bold title and people came in with an opinion - it’s that mentality which I’m explicit toward. I think the way the vort’s armor is now is worth updating and the current one looks like crap and if fixed, the game will not suffer for it: that’s my opinion. Not to mention, last time I complained about this on the forums, years ago,  like a week later they tinted the armor green officially - so they do care about giving things a chance.</p>
<p>I mean, besides the fact that I have to listen to Kelly Bailey while playing, I think Black Mesa hit the nail on the head after all these years of updates. And now besides the vorts (and maybe some eyeball decisions with the bsquid), I couldn’t come up with a bad thing to say about the game. I just think the vort’s armor kinda look like shit, because I mean, they’re not even mapped properly. Screw me, I guess.</p>

            <p>Holy shit lmao that’s not exactly the same as telling someone to fuck off. Was pretty much saying the IDEA of that can fuck off, but still, that’s no reason for you to be waving a flag right now.</p>
<p>No one was a victim until you came in here, so let’s maybe just get back on topic?<br>

<p>Edit: did you look through my profile? You need to maybe get some better things to do with your time. I’m trying really hard not to make you any more upset but you’re being a real (edit: difficult fellowman).</p>

Seems to me that there’s a good five year gap. Your other antagonistic posts beyond this thread’s appear to date back to 2012. Times change, especially when it’s been five entire years.</p>
<p>Also, I never said that you’re expected to act cheery. Acting like an adult and not having an aggressive attitude to everyone that disagrees with you does not require an upbeat attitude to accomplish.</p>

<p>You’re perfectly capable of refuting people without being unnecessarily aggressive to them.</p>

            <p>While I agree with a good chunk of your points, you <strong>really</strong> don’t need to act so aggressive to everyone else here because they may or may not have a different point of view. Referring to others’ thoughts as “hogwosh, mumbo-jumbo, and nonsense” while telling them to fuck off makes you come off as childish.</p>
<p>This isn’t the Steam forums. We don’t talk like that here.</p>

            <p>Yeah THIS big time.</p>
<p>I’d love to see and overwhelming rehaul of added animations and AI for all the creatures. The whole Quiver idea, the ENTIRE reason for Half Life, was to simulate aliens coming into our world. They were supposed to exist independent of the player and breed, expand, explore, hunt, etc - all without the player even being there. Their ideas were similar to modern simulators and they were more ahead of their time than they could pull off before the game’s polish time was up.</p>
<p>I was thrilled to read that the vorts are going to be getting animations and stuff that make them look more sympathetic. I’m just hoping that maybe all Xen creatures get a bit more personality. Sometimes I want to relive the experience, not just see it again in HD, you feel me? Sometimes back then, subtle things were understood because of limitations, but today? You’re right, I’d love to see a cowering Vortiguant like in the original HL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, excuse me for presuming, but I was under the impression that a thread claiming the Vortigaunts still look like garbage would have less to do with arguing irrelevant headcanons and more about what, you know, the vortigaunt models actually <em>look like</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much to say there than what I already said I think? They’re like really low resoution, unclear visually, and HANGIN THE FLIP OFF the model. I’d literally be satisfied with a higher resolution skin, them copying the damn bracelets x2 so they go all the way around the wrist, and them removing the crotch rocket plate. Right now the vorts currently look like they have some high tech alien wrist watches. Also, how hard is it to remove the combine biotic crotch plate thing? Xen could fucking less about endless reproduction, doesn’t even fit their lore. Gives strange ideas about what they might be after, also. Wrong kind of use of that storytelling imo. How can you NOT bring up story there? They don’t look good and they’re not supposed to.</p>
