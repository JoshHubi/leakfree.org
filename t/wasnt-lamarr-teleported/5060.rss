    <title>Wasn&#39;t Lamarr Teleported?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wasnt-lamarr-teleported/5060</link>
    <description>In HL2, when you take the first teleporter, you can clearly see Lamarr jump in and get teleported to a beach.
Later in the game, when you take the teleporter Mossman was working on(when you arrive at Kleiners lab, and tell you it&#39;s been a week), Lamarr is there!
How?</description>

<p>It would be awesome if the Half-Life series started to have a running gag where Lamar keeps getting teleported/shot/various transportation into far off places just to return the next game without any explanation.</p>

<p>Yeah, kinda like how Kenny keeps dying in every episode of southpark but hes magically alive again the next episode. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Lamarr could have ended up back at Kleiner’s lab at the same time as Gordon.  She (do Headcrabs have genders?)</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t think they have genders because they don’t have “Sex” They grow into a Gonarch, I think once they reach that stage they don’t need to mate to have kids.</p>

            <p>One funny thing when you see Lamarr after the combine portal is that she backs off, and dissapears, I haven’t found her anywhere in the lab. If anyone knows where she went, please tell me. :freeman:</p>

            <p>Just to correct you, Lamarr wasn’t teleported to a beach, it was a desert. You can noclip there from the chapter ‘Red Letter Day’, I have been playing around there a lot, just like I have in the end of Portal, at the outside of the Aperture Facility. But I think Lamarr found her way back to Dr. Kleiner, there is a hard as hell game on <a href="http://newgrounds.com" rel="nofollow noopener">newgrounds.com</a> named Lamarr is going home where you actually play as Lamarr, I only got to the third level, but I suspect that you eventualy come to Dr. Kleiners lab. :freeman:</p>

<p>well if that puzzles you then you better not hope they put lamar in episode 3 otherwise explaining how she gets back after being launched into space will be one heck of an explanation.</p>

<p>do you think the rebels are going to stop shooting a headcrab to see if it’s lamarr? they all look the same even I would have shooted lamarr if I had a gun back in hl2 before kleiner explained me that she could not do any damage to me.</p>

            <p>I’d like to point out that a crow got teleported into the lab after Freeman came back the first time, and it wasn’t even in the group of matter teleported from the lab; it’s also possible Lamarr was teleported to different locations than Gordon was after the initial teleport to the wasteland and was maybe teleported back into the first section of the lab when Gordon was deposited outside the lab.</p>

<p>You can’t see her actually disappearing, but I think you can get through fast enough that it would have been impossible for her to hide within the time.</p>

<p>This. :awesome:</p>
<p>Also, immediately after this scene, Lamarr ducks behind the door again, and if you quickly run through it immediately after you can see that she’s disappeared. As I said, Lamarr is not bound by conventional physics.</p>
