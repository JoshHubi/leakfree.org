            <p>Maybe someday one of these threads won’t be a bunch of stupid posts about huge games like FFVII, Morrowind and MWF2. You don’t have to like any of those games (I can’t get into CoD at all) but to say they’re the worst ever just shows you’ve either A.) played two games ever or B.) are just looking for some attention/points for shitting on a popular franchise. And I think I know which one describes the kids in this thread.</p>
<p>I’m actually curious what terrible games are out there, but there are like 3 legitimate posts on the subject in here. The worst game I’ve ever played to its conclusion – and I hate to say it, because it was soooo technically groundbreaking – is Trespasser.</p>
<p>Most technologically advanced game of the 90’s (and in some way, the 00’s) but an absolute nightmare to play.</p>

            <p>Turok Evolution takes the cake for me - guns were grey, enemies were grey, levels were grey. Hell, sometimes I couldn’t tell if I was playing on a colour TV. Also, the gameplay stunk up the place like the corpse in my basement.</p>

<p>To his defense, he said “the worst game <span class="bbcode-b">I ever played</span>”<br>

<p>I mean, I probably played a lot of shitty games back in the day, but I don’t remember about them… Except for Mario is missing… god that was shitty. We had rented it for a week, and we couldn’t even figure out how to play the damn thing. Pretty sure we went back and traded it for something else.</p>

<p><em>Futile attempt to bring the thread back on topic</em> I think the worst games I have ever played are CoD4 and MW2. Its not the campaign that was really bad though, just the multiplayer.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I…can’t believe this. As I said before, the WORST games ever?</p>
<p>I once saw Prince of Persia: Warrior Within on a list of the top 10 worst games of all time. Firstly, I think that game was amazing; the Dhaka was shit-scary, and it was challenging, deep, visually pleasing and fun all at the same time. Secondly, even if it had flaws, and even if you ignored all of the above, it is still NOWHERE NEAR THE WORST GAME OF ALL TIME. A game may be bad, awful, disturbing, shit and even ludicrously disgraceful, and yet it STILL wont be as bad as the worst games ever.</p>
<p>In order to be the worst game ever, it must be, in every single aspect of its being, a failure. Why? Because in order to be the worst ever, it must be worse than every single other game ever (or at least in the top 10). Not simply bad, but absolutely terrible, with not a single redeeming feature (not even that its so bad its funny). And there have been games that have failed to that extent. Big time.</p>
<p>Most bad games, see Big Rigs, are, on a technical level, unplayable. It was barely possible to win in Big Rigs, let alone begin to play it. Superman 64 is a little beyond that, since it was <span class="bbcode-i">technically</span> playable, but no sane person would; it looked and played terribly, much like another ‘worst game’, Daikatana. Ergo, in order to get to the level of worst game ever, you must at the very least satisfy the requirement of virtual unplayability; the looks and feel of the game, putting aside the storyline and subsidiary considerations, must be an affront to nature, and there is just <span class="bbcode-i">no conceivable way</span> that MW2 does that.</p>
<p>At its very core, MW2 is just a basic FPS with good looking graphics and a basic storyline. Ultimately, its not the worst game ever, just no better than average. Sure, its overpriced, its short, its multiplayer is awful and there’s little enjoyment for some, but its by no means the worst ever. Not even a little bit close. Average? Maybe. Worst ever? No. Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>I liked the demo as well, and i got it hoping they would fix some of the ridiculous problems.</p>
<p>Whats sad is that most of the issues from the demo haven’t even been fixed yet and they released a new patch for PC which fixes very little of them, but they dropped support for the console versions afterward so they probably will drop pc support soon too. And most of the stupid issues still remain, along with one of the worst netcodes ever. The bullet delay when you have even a bit of lag is like over a half a second.</p>
<p>It can be fun, but the frustration the game provides heavily outweighs the good points of the game. That and there are like under 100 players on at any given time.</p>

            <p>Thats kinda the point of a Demo. I mean, I you can’t find one good part of your game, then it really is beyond bad.</p>
