    <title>N64 Gameshark a good deal?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/n64-gameshark-a-good-deal/4483</link>
    <description>I am one of those old school gamers who still uses the N64 frequently. I had always wanted a Gameshark, so I went to eBay today to find one that looked good. I found a $12 one, so I have come to ask if it was a good deal.

So, is it worth $12?

            <p>you might want to think about donating to the pj64 team. If you do you get access the newer beta build (1.7) It’s not 100% stable but has many graphical improvements in many of the games. Still not 100% tho. Kinda sad that development has grinded to a halt to with pj64.</p>
<p>Also I’m still waiting for marshallh from retroactive to finish development on his SDRAM cartridge emulator. Will allow you to load n64 roms into a retail n64. Also sense the cart emulator will have full memory control you will be able to change values on the fly (same thing the game shark does)</p>

            <p>Gameshark + Goldeneye = Endless replayability. Not that it didn’t already have plenty.  But people have hacked it enough to have created their own levels entirely from scratch with gameshark codes.</p>

            <p>BUY IT.  I had a Pro version, where you can write your own codes and look at game coding and stuff, and it was great, even if I DID waste hours scanning for values in StarFox 64, triyng to make my lasers be replaced with bombs, only to create a code to disable weapons entirely, or make laser powerups do nothing!</p>

            <p>I’d say, if you want to have fun while potentially Corrupting saved games, go right the fuck ahead.</p>
<p>At $12, I’d be cautious if I were you. A cheat device THAT old (the N64 turns fourteen this year) is a rare thing to find in working condition.</p>

            <p>I’d say it’s a good deal, if you want all the developer cheats and such. For instance, you can do a hell of a lot of stuff in Goldeneye, like random characters for all NPCs (ie. all NPCs are Jaws)</p>
