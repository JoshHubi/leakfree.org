    <title>G-Man in Apprehension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/g-man-in-apprehension/14767</link>

I don&#39;t know if this is a new bug or an old one,  but still...</description>

            <p>yep, confirming I’m seeing this too (sorry, 7 months after OP).  I definitely remember this did not occur in earlier builds, so it must be a new (well…new-ish) bug.</p>
