    <title>Shotgun world model</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shotgun-world-model/14336</link>
    <description>Shotgun in third person(world model) has that grip that extends so shooter can lean it to support weapon with shoulder. While in first person there is no grip and world model looks little bit too shinny.

Sorry if this was brought up before  :slight_smile:</description>
