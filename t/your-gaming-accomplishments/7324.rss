    <description>i&#39;ll admit, i&#39;m not rich and i never have been; nor my parents. When i got a videogame for Christmas or my birthday, it was a big freak&#39;n deal. New games were a rare thing to have in our home, so when those rainy days came, i had to make my games LAST. Before games came integrated trophies, achievements and the like, oldschool gamers like us had to come up with their OWN challenges to keep repetitive play-thrus interesting and fun.

( Well, maybe not always &quot;fun&quot;, but certainly interesting. )

Back in the NES days, i prided myself in taking on tough challenges like playing through Mario3 with no &#39;shrooms or power-up items but it wasn&#39;t challenging enough. So i fought my way through the original Zelda with no sword. Turns out, everybody&#39;s already done that challenge, so i decided to take it one step further. i wanted to play through the HARDEST Zelda game, The Adventure of Link, using ONLY the items necessary to complete the game. No shield, life or fire spells. (the rest are required to finish the game) No items, except those absolutely necessary, (no cross, no magic key and NO CANDLE). i rejected every level-up screen except magic (required to enter the final dungeon) and obtained NO HEARTS.

So far i&#39;ve finished every Zelda game on minimalist rules (3 hearts, no death, etc.) but The Adventure of Link was by far my biggest accomplishment.

After Zelda2, i went on to complete [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82W2RYqEspQ&#39;]Faxanadu[/url] minimalist (no armor, no sword, no items, etc.) and finished Half-Life with crowbar only (unless absolutely required). i&#39;ve finished Half-Life2 and episodes with crowbar only and grav-gun only rules. i finished Metal Gear Solid 1, 2 and 3 on the hardest difficulty setting without being spotted and using only dart guns. Turns out Grand Theft Auto3 is a LOT harder if you play through the entire game with the same car you start with, don&#39;t kill any innocents and commit as few crimes as possible. GTA4 is even HARDER with the same rules, especially because Roman&#39;s car sometimes disappears between cutscenes!

So what accomplishments have you acquired? Anything worth bragging about or have you a challenge to share with others?

            <p>I beat Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time in 5 hours 30 minutes once. Straight shot all the way through in one night. I remember this quite clearly because I had been sipping a milkshake throughout the first half but then when I brought the lights back up after the credits rolled my room had been invaded by ants.</p>

            <p>I’ve never been very good at games, so I was assuming I’d never have done anything worth mentioning in here, but then I remembered back when I played Wii Sports. I got so many 300’s in bowling that my rating was literally off the chart!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>in the original Unreal Tournament, i had a record of 55 monster kills against 10 God-Likes. The constant “M-M-M-MON-MON-MO-M-MON-MON…!” for a solid minute was what made my mom burst into my room. She told me to turn the volume down. Once i moved my hand from the mouse to the volume knob, i got fragged and lost the record.</p>
<p>i had an awesome mutator that kept track of everything including jumps, dodges and distance traveled, plus double, multi and monster kills.</p>

Skirmigeddon is fucking impossible on most maps.</p>

            <p>Lots of people must have done that, but i completed Portal without the funnel (Chamber 18 took ages, i still don’t know how i did it)<br>
Wasn’t able to do the above on Portal 2 (you can’t remove the funnel option) so i decided to get all the achievements, and was successful.<br>
Was also quite proud when i managed to workout how to change the skins on L4D/L4D2. So none of the survivors have their original skins now.<br>
And as most people here, completed the HL series!</p>
