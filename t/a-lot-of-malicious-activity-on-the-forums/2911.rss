    <title>A lot of malicious activity on the forums?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-lot-of-malicious-activity-on-the-forums/2911</link>
    <description>is the forum admin going to stop this crap?

I keep on getting stupid PM messages claiming to be from the Forum Admin, and it always says the following, you have a virus and are strongly recommended to check.  I get these damn messages every other day.

We need to stop this crap, what is with all of these damn trolls trying to do malicious activity?  are they trying to sabotage the community and project?

Thanks for all info!
