    <title>Source SDK 2006 was auto-downloaded along with SDK 2007 by Steam - can&#39;t uninstall</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-sdk-2006-was-auto-downloaded-along-with-sdk-2007-by-steam-cant-uninstall/10799</link>
    <description>After I tried downloading Source SDK Base 2007 for use with Black Mesa, I noticed that Steam also auto-downloaded Source SDK Base 2006. I paused the download, and tried to remove it to prevent it from using disk space (2808 MB, according to Steam). However, when I try to remove it within Steam, Steam says I can&#39;t since its data is used by Source SDK Base 2007:

I have been able to play Black Mesa even if Source SDK Base 2006 was not fully downloaded (I paused it at around 50%).

Is it normal for Source SDK Base 2007 or Black Mesa to require Source SDK Base 2006? If not, how do I remove it?</description>

<p>Black Mesa requires SDK Base 2007 and SDK Base 2007 requires some of the 2006 Base’s resources.  I don’t think you have to download the entire SDK Base though.  I installed SDK Base 2007 and it only downloaded a portion of the SDK Base 2006 I think, but I might be wrong about that.</p>

</aside>
<p>Did you let SDK Base 2006 finish downloading?</p>

<p>Yes. BM does not require the entire SDK Base 2006 installed. It can remain in a paused state, as long as SDK Base 2007 shows as “Ready to play”.</p>

<p>Good to know. Thanks.</p>

<p>Btw, if you resume the SDK Base 2006, it won’t take long to reach “Ready to play” state, so I suppose it’s not that big of an overhead.</p>

<p>I tried resuming but it needs about 1 GB more, so I paused it again.</p>
<p>Edit: What I eventually did was just uninstall SDK Base 2007, and then uninstall SDK Base 2006 and then reinstall SDK Base 2007, mindful that 2006 might auto-download (pause it immediately if it is auto-downloading). I then verified if SDK Base 2006’s Automatic update setting in Steam is set to ‘Do not automatically update this tool’.</p>
