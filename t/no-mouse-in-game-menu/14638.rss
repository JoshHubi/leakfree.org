    <title>No mouse in game menu</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-mouse-in-game-menu/14638</link>
    <description>I just installed the game and i have no mouse cursor in the main menu or while accessing the menu during game play.
This is really annoying and prevents me from changing most of my settings.
I have messed with the mouse options in windows but it didnt change anything. Mouse trails are off.</description>
