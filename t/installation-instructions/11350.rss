    <title>Installation instructions?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/installation-instructions/11350</link>
    <description>Every game engine is different, and installing a mod on a different engine requires a different approach. The first time I installed a mod on the Total War engine, I got it wrong. The first time I installed a mod on the ARMA engine, I got it wrong. This is the first time I have installed a mod on the Source engine, and I would like to get it right on my first attempt.

It may seem very straightforward to you veterans, I know because I have become very proficient at installing mods on certain game engines, but the Source engine is not one of them and you would be amazed at how easy it is to screw up something that seems so simple. I was hoping to find a detailed set of instructions, even a basic do&#39;s and don&#39;ts would suffice. For example, do the files need to be extracted/installed in any particular order? A detailed list of procedures, outlining every step of the process would be ideal of course(assume I&#39;m an idiot).</description>

            <p>Install Black Mesa:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be sure to install Steam (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/Steam" data-bbcode="true">https://store.steampowered.com/Steam</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be sure to install Source SDK 2007. From inside the Steam interface click “Library”, find a dropdown menu that is default labeled as “All Games” and in that dropdown, choose “Tools”. Scroll towards the bottom of<br>
the list to find and install the “Source SDK 2007”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close down and exit Steam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.gamefront.com/black-mesa-is-live-download-it-here/" data-bbcode="true">https://www.gamefront.com/black-mesa-is-live-download-it-here/</a> scroll down to see three separate download links. Download all three. The complete game installation package consists of the three files:<br>
a) blackmesa.7z<br>
b) BlackMesa.md5<br>
c) blackmesa-setup.exe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the game by clicking on blackmesa-setup.exe and be sure it is installed to this directory:<br>
\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS</p>
</li>

<p>Launch Steam and find the game “Black Mesa” listed in your games library</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>Actually, this is one of the easiest mods to install, especially since it comes with an installer.  I’m assuming you already have BMS downloaded.  The download should have 3 files; blackmesa.7z, blackmesa-setup.exe and blackmesa.md5.  After you have installed Source SDK 2007 (in the tools section of the library, just double click and agree to the terms), run the BMS installer.  It will automatically verify the download and extract the files to your steamapps/sourcemods folder.  Once it is finished, restart steam and BMS should be in your library!</p>
