    <title>Sound card woes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sound-card-woes/7587</link>
    <description>So I just installed my new Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium sound card.  My problem is that my subwoofer only works if my speakers are set to stereo.  In 5.1, it&#39;s completely missing from the soundscape.

However, if I am testing the speakers in the console, the subwoofer works (AND ONLY WORKS) if the speakers are set to 5.1.

What the fuck?</description>

            <p>Sorry for the bump, but it still isn’t <span class="bbcode-i">there</span>.  It’s especially noticeable when listening to music.  If there’s a sudden drum or something, the bass will drop out and that particular noise will be really soft…almost like the two canceled each other out.  I have no idea what to do here.</p>

            <p>I think I got around it by enabling bass redirection and boosting the subwoofer.</p>
<p>Still sounds kinda wonky.  But I’m closer.  Will continue after sleep.</p>
<p>EDIT: Which means it’s a problem with my speakers, not my sound card, I know.  Still…I don’t seem to have an issue when I hook my ipod up to the system via aux…and I didn’t have to deal with any of this on my old computer.</p>

            <p>I had similar problems. I had a integrated sound card, and my left speaker did not work in any configuration. When I changed my mobo (changing my sound card), everything was fixed. I think it’s your sound card problem. Check it out.</p>

            <p>does that apply to every source of 5.1 sound except the console test?</p>
