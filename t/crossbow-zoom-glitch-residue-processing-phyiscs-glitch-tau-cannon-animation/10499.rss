    <title>Crossbow zoom glitch/Residue Processing phyiscs glitch/Tau cannon animation</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crossbow-zoom-glitch-residue-processing-phyiscs-glitch-tau-cannon-animation/10499</link>
    <description>I found a bug when using the crossbow&#39;s zoom, after you zoom out the normal aiming reticule disappears from the screen for all weapons. It also causes the save notification when quick-saving to disappear as well. To fix it I just tapped &#39;esc&#39; to the menu screen and back, everything returns to normal.

     In Residue Processing a rather hilarious glitch occurred between loading points. After sliding midway down the chute from the trash compactor it stopped to load the next map, when it loaded, I proceeded to fall expecting to land into the water below, instead I was launched to the sky box, falling back down to a crushing death. Upon reloading, I landed normally.

     Lastly, I noticed the tau cannon&#39;s animation when running dips down like every other weapon, except it does not rise back, It freezes and just pops back into it&#39;s normal position.</description>

            <p>it also goes the other way. once you equip the crossbow and do a quick save, the crisshair disappears without ever having zoomed.</p>
<p>a simple return to menu via ‘esc’ and back to the game makes the crosshair reappear.</p>
