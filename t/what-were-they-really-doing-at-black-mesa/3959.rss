    <title>What Were They Really Doing At Black Mesa?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-were-they-really-doing-at-black-mesa/3959</link>
    <description>title pretty much says it all, but what im confused about is, they were testing theses alien gem things, but they were also launching satellites into space?? what does that have to do with anything? im confused about that whole thing here.

so what exactly were they really doing at Black Mesa Research Facility?

p.s if theres already a thread like this, sorry, the search function never gives me any results</description>

            <p>In the original HL you had to launch a satellite in order to fix everything.  There really isn’t anything to speculate or question.  All known research that was going on at BM during HL has been mentioned in this thread:</p>

<p>…Ham Solo pretty much summed it up, but perhaps we can also include communications research due to the satellite launch?..</p>

<p>If anyone is looking for technical details on how all of this works, you may as well make it up yourself because its science FICTION.  Some of you people really need to go outside and get a life. lol</p>
