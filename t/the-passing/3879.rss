    <description>I haven&#39;t seen a thread for it yet.

It&#39;s out, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one on here who&#39;s played it through.

Your thoughts?


I thought it was fun, but it was seem the nodes are fucked up, I attacked a witch, and instead of chasing me, it ran full pelt to my right and ran around in circles.

It also doesn&#39;t seem as well optimized as the rest of the game, as I normally get around 50-60 fps constant, I was getting 25-35 fps throughout.

I was also kind of depressed when I found the, for courtesy of not spoiling who it is, other survivor&#39;s corpse with an M-16 on it at the end.

So, share your thoughts, etc.</description>

            <p>so I watched a walk-through of the new dlc the passing for l4d2.The new characters meet up with the original characters, well except for one. Sadly you can find Bill’s body at the campain’s finale. It was kind of forshadowed on the poster.<br>
“nobody survives forever”<br>
But what I wanted to talk about is Bill’s voice actor, Jim French. I pretty sure it is because of his absences that valve decided to have bill killed off.<br>
I heard rumors that he is in prison but I’m not sure if its true. If it is true does any one know what he did or how long he will be in there?</p>

            <p>I think what everyone else thinks basically. The little dialouge there was between the two sets of characters was very unmemorable.</p>
<p>I already guessed the dead character because of the voice actor situation.</p>
<p>It was quite boring, it felt more like a set of user made maps rather than a Valve quality campaign. Except for the final map, that was really well done. Getting the gas cans was more challenging than in Dead Center, but it was quite easy and repetitive. Retrieve finales are not as fun as a Bridge type finale or a regular waiting one.</p>

<p>^this is true.</p>
<p>but honestly, i don’t know why so many people are angry/upset about this.</p>
<p>i only see 2 valid reasons(fps and technical problems/lack of survivor interactions) but other than those i don’t see whats wrong. it was the same high quality l4d action, the new weapons were nice and it actually had some great moments. there’s no way players could play cross games, and the title the passing  was a pretty obvious hint someone was gonna get kilt. i thought it brought the games plots together great. i know that it seemed kinda short but it was free and it had more of the game play that valve is known for. you wouldn’t complain if someone handed you a 20$ bill just because it had some sharpie ink on it would you?</p>

            <p>I think The Passing was pretty cool. I liked all the easter eggs, and I felt like I was the only one that noticed the Dawn of the Dead reference, when the girl goes after her dog. I felt like right after I saw that, some of the zombies looked like the guy on the roof, after he gets infected. I also liked the reintroduction of the whi- err, the Witches that lie on the floor, rather than wander around. I may have missed some already like that, but it felt like this was the first time I had seen them. I also think I heard Zoey say “Louis is going to hate me for this,” as she tossed down pills. Also, it was hilarious when I heard Ellis say “Oh, I get it now! There MUST be vampires! I mean, if there’s zombies, why not vampires, and werewolves…” or something along those lines.</p>

            <p>It was very nice IMO, until the third part of the campaign: the “meeting” with L4D’s survivors was ridiculous, it looked totally out of place. Plus, Bill’s death, what the hell where you thinking, Valve? It was really disturbing and ruined a bit of L4D’s atmosphere, I mean I won’t play L4D the same way again.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>I enjoyed The Passing. It wasn’t a huge success, but it was something new, and I liked that. Anyone else think the Fallen Survivor isn’t acting like they said it would, though? I seem to remember Valve saying if it saw you, it would run away, and you’d have to hunt it down and kill it for supplies. I’ve come across five or six, and only one ran away.</p>
<p>Mutations seems fun though. I like Realism Versus, it’s a nice little modification there that kinda brings Versus into a whole new gameplay (oddly enough). I can’t wait to see what else they have in store for us.</p>
<p>My only big point of disconetent with the actual level design was when you’re in the second map, and you get to the gate where if you open it, you set off an alarm. After you open it, it says to get to the safehouse, which leads you to think it’s nearby. Five minutes later of running, a few rooms and sewers away, you finally come to the safe room. Seemed too early to be telling us to get to the safe room.</p>
<p>Lastly, although the survivor interactions weren’t all that great, I thought the cover fire was rather helpful during the finale. It wouldn’t have been nearly as easy if they’d just stood there.</p>

<p>It only runs away when it’s hurt, which sucks.</p>

            <p><span class="mention">@The</span> Keeper: I completely agree about the mutation. I was all over L4D for the longest time when it came out, but for some reason L4D2 just kinda lost interest after a month or two. Just played the Mutation yesterday and while the lobby system continues to suck, the fact that I got a good and enjoyable team in one try and that teamwork seemed to be prominent was a great change from pubbing a normal versus. The slight difficulty increase is also just enough for the infected.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed The Passing. It wasn’t a huge success, but it was something new, and I liked that. Anyone else think the Fallen Survivor isn’t acting like they said it would, though? I seem to remember Valve saying if it saw you, it would run away, and you’d have to hunt it down and kill it for supplies. I’ve come across five or six, and only one ran away.</p>
<p>Mutations seems fun though. I like Realism Versus, it’s a nice little modification there that kinda brings Versus into a whole new gameplay (oddly enough). I can’t wait to see what else they have in store for us.</p>
<p>My only big point of disconetent with the actual level design was when you’re in the second map, and you get to the gate where if you open it, you set off an alarm. After you open it, it says to get to the safehouse, which leads you to think it’s nearby. Five minutes later of running, a few rooms and sewers away, you finally come to the safe room. Seemed too early to be telling us to get to the safe room.</p>
<p>Lastly, although the survivor interactions weren’t all that great, I thought the cover fire was rather helpful during the finale. It wouldn’t have been nearly as easy if they’d just stood there.</p>

            <p>I don’t know about you guys, but I was always like “meh” towards replayability in l4d. Versus didn’t do it for me.</p>
<p>But, holy shit mutation has totally turned l4d around for me. I played The passing 3 times in that mode and its epic. It forces extreme team work and is the anti stupid ass squad m8 going rambo style alone. I so easy to lose track of your mates. I definitely recommend trying it before you judge this FREEEE dlc that valve epicly game us. Seriously guys, don’t shit on valve. Just look at those dicks at activision charging 15$ for 5 maps, 3 of which are old.</p>
