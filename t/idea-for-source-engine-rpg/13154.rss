    <title>Idea for Source engine RPG</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/idea-for-source-engine-rpg/13154</link>
    <description>My idea is that the BMRF, instead of being invaded by the HECU, had its entrances and exits heavily sealed to the point of no return, so the HECU could focus on the surface.  After Gordon killed Nilhianth, and was placed in statis, the world returned to normal.
       Several generations pass, and the facility has faded from the public eye.  Several factions exist inside, growing crops and raising xenians.  You are in one of those factions, and a crisis has arisen: the reserve power is running out in your sector.  You are sent out to find another source, possibly from one of the neighboring sectors.


As far as I know, an RPG structure can be made in Source.

            <p>Building an RPG in the Source Engine is definitely doable using the stock dev tools. The entity I/O system is definitely powerful enough to handle it, but it might get very cumbersome and it would probably require a sizable amount of effort over a long period of time.</p>
<p>That said, if anyone wants to take the plunge, I’d fully support them. I’d like to see what comes out of it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I think there’s also the issue in that the world doesn’t just return to normal after the Nihilanth is defeated. Let’s not restrict a brand new idea to canon.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>In the concept, I imagined the upper sections (Questionable Ethics, WGH, etc)<br>
were completely filled with concrete.  This allowed the HECU to focus on the surface, and hold of the invasion until Nilhianth was destroyed.  Still, the surface is effectively completely barred off.</p>
<p>Sort of like a “What If?”/Alternate Timeline idea, though the government would probably have most of the surface buildings razed to stop any inquiries.</p>
<p>Also, according to google, a nuked desert looks like this:</p>

<p>Not necessarily. The upper levels could be all the parts of the facility that got destroyed by the nuke, and then the surface can be… whatever. Lol what happens when you nuke a desert anyways?</p>
<p>Besides, this is hundreds of years after the Black Mesa Incident, so there’s plenty of time for things to cool down.</p>
<p>Cool concept, let us know what happens with it!</p>
