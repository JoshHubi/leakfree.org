    <title>Background noise really loud in Mass Effect</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/background-noise-really-loud-in-mass-effect/4569</link>
    <description>Yesterday, I bought Mass Effect on steam, and after it downloaded, I start to play it. One thing really bugged me, however, The background noises were way too loud, and I couldn&#39;t hear anything that the people were saying. I tried turning down the volume in the audio options, but it still stayed too loud. Anyone know how to fix this? This is the steam version, if that helps.</description>

<p>Or just upgrade your audio drivers or something.</p>
