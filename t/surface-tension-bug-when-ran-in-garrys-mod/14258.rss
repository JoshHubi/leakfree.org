    <title>Surface Tension bug when ran in Garry&#39;s Mod?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/surface-tension-bug-when-ran-in-garrys-mod/14258</link>
    <description>I know this isn&#39;t related to the game itself, but please hear me out.

I play Garry&#39;s Mod and load Black Mesa maps into the game. I have bought Black Mesa on Steam and copied all the files over (effectively mounted it) in Gmod. I loaded the Surface Tension map and everything was fine, the harriers went across the screen, except the waterfall and stream in the distance wasn&#39;t animated, which spoiled the mood entirely. How do I fix this bug? I have good Hammer skills, but my computer lags heavily as soon as I open the map when decompiled.</description>

<p>That map uses particle systems to animate the waterfall, as it isn’t map controlled. Make sure you import the particles</p>

<p>Thanks! I’ll try that.</p>
