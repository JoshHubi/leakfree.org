    <title>2D backgrounds</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/2d-backgrounds/12888</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the right section. :fffuuu:

My computer is quite slow and I don&#39;t want to waste time loading a background map whenever I launch the game. If it was possible to replace them with videos, they would load much faster. Did anyone try doing something like this yet? Deleting background .bsp&#39;s is another option, but then you get only blurry image... Take HL2: DM for example - it loads extremely fast and server browser is ready really fast because of no 3D real-time background.</description>

            <p>You can convert a video to a texture file and then tell the engine to load this as your menu background i think you can do this in the scripts…</p>
<p>Check how the won theme works scriptwise and then replace the vtf with the video vtf.</p>
<p>There is a counterstrike video menu tutorial somewhere you will need vtf edit</p>
<p>animated  texture.</p>

            <p>Source 2007 can’t play videos without modification. You’d need access to BM’s source code and extensive knowledge of programming and the VGUI systems to implement something like that.<br>
You’d probably be better off using the WON style menu or creating your own by replacing the current menu loading vtfs with a screencap of the background maps post-load.</p>

            <p>Deleting all background**.bsp files also gives me a simple blurry image. I meant vidoes from Black Mesa’s YT channel.</p>

            <p>If you want, you can start the game with the launch parameter “-dev” and it won’t load the background map, instead settling for the blurred image. I think you might end up with some dev text in the upper corner, though…</p>
<p>If you wanted a more effort-ful workaround, you could create a new map that consists of a small box with the tools/toolsblack texture, a light entity and a player start, then change the listings in your scripts\chapterbackgrounds.txt to it. Then your game would load a a black background which would load far quicker than the BM ones, only then your menu would be black and not all fancy.</p>

            <p>I don’t know of any videos, but there was that guy that made the HL1 WON-styled UI with the yellow buttons and it came with a nice background image</p>
