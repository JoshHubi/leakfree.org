    <title>Is the real military capable of killing scientists for a government cover-up?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-the-real-military-capable-of-killing-scientists-for-a-government-cover-up/2398</link>
    <description>I know we as a nation have had are fair share of war crimes. But im curious if the military is capable of such sacralage and murder of inncoent people.

Hell back in HL1 I was saying this: MOTHERFUCKER SHOT ME IM NO GOD DAMN ALIEN ARE YOU BLIND YOU LEFT THIS BULLET ON THE GORUND! MIND IF I SHOOT IT IN YOUR CHEST!!! WHAT THE HELL GET THE FUCKING COPTER AWAY!!!!! GOD DAMN TANKS SHOOTING SHELLs FROM HELL!
But that was off topic.

Well anyway if their is any real equivelant to Black Mesa please post it.</description>

<p>Masturbation runs rampant through military ranks, even going as far back as Somalia as I know although it probably goes back to ancient militaries. About five pages of Black Hawk Down discussed the more perverse aspects of life at the air base, the last one culminating in saying how a Ranger (mercifully unidentified by Bowden) ‘wrapping a rope around his penis and and announcing ‘I’m takin’ the dog out for a walk’ ". That’s probably the most stress relief you’d need in war time, although people can always get more nefarious and perverse than that.</p>

<p>At some point the likelihood of the dog being shot, poisoned or otherwise removed starts rising really fast.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, it does rise fast. Really fast, my dog was poisoned because it got into there trash ONE time. So everytime they put their trash out, they dumped bleach  all over it. Dog was dead within the week… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>But The military is fairly capable of doing it. They know people will suspect something but they don’t care, as long as nobody that was involved speaks.<br>
Things like this have happened multiple times. The Moon landing for example, someone from NASA involved in it was supposedly gonna say it never happened and was faked, I don’t remember the name though. And what happened? He died. Of course they say he commited suicide. Or maybe a so called UFO sighting. This person had evidence that a UFO had abducted him. What happened here?  When he was dying of cancer or HIV or something (He already had it before he claimed to have the evidence) he said that the CIA and a few soldiers had come to collect the evidence and that if he didin’t hand it over they would kill each of his family members until he did, and if he still didn’t give it to them after all this, they’d kill him, and fram him for homocide. Of course it’s never been proven this actually happened and that he wasn’t just making it up, it still sounds like something they would do.</p>
<p>BTW, I’m in no way a conspiracy nut, just giving examples i have heard about. And apperently there’s 13 or so levels of secrets and security that even the president can’t know about so the military has alot of secrets we probabl;y ahvn’t even heard of…</p>

            <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that it’s quite obvious that given the  money and effort, there is a possibility that a government could cover up something like that.  The existence of the possibility is a fact.  The probability, however, that they could totally cover it up is, in my opinion, negligible. The necessity of me to get off forums and my computer in general because of a calculus exam tomorrow, is however, 100% obvious.</font>[/SIZE]<br>

            <p>If a man can kill another for no reason a soldier can kill groups of innocent ppl and after it say: they attacked me first, I was defending myself… I have no doubt of that and if something like an invasion like in black mesa (no need of aliens just another enemy army) happens they can kill any innocent they want while they destroy the entire facillity and say that was an accident of the ppl who was working on it without letting anything wich can say they where there…</p>
<p>So sometimes you can’t see a soldier how a form of salvation, victory or like a god, he can be the worst thing you can meet in your whole life…</p>

            <p>Hey… the military was able to cover up the “Roswell alien crash” for like forever. With the technology of today… I have no doubt that the military can cover-up such an act. There are also hiding stuff right now like weather warfare, very advance weapons, and classified things.</p>

            <p>^ I thought that was referring to the Combine, rather than the initial Xen invasion.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe it was localized during the Cascade itself, and then after Gordon killed the Nihilanth it spread out to the entire planet. Perhaps the Nihilanth was intentionally keeping it in a small area so his forces wouldn’t be too spread out when they teleported.</p>
