    <title>[Glitch] Elevator glitch [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glitch-elevator-glitch-fixed/10787</link>
    <description>Hi all,

first of all I would like to thank the black mesa team for re-making an amazing game.


Now glitch time.
I used to use this trick on HL:1 for speed run. When you take the first elevator to that place where there are electricity on the water and you have to turn that off (I forgot the name of that place). When you&#39;re taking the elevator up (The door should be open), press the button and quickly exit the elevator. You should be stuck there infinity! There is a button to open the elevator door but it doesn&#39;t work.

Thanks.</description>

            <p>Although this should be addressed, there are many situations like these in quite a few games, and it’s usually the player’s fault.</p>
