    <title>The MP5 and M4A1, and NPC allies.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-mp5-and-m4a1-and-npc-allies/13573</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always disappointed that M4A1 is not accessible. Of course i do understand that it&#39;s practically silly that the Glock 17 is going to share ammunition with the M4A1 which is idiotic unless the M4A1 is rechambered to use 9mm para.

Of course, what i think would have a great way of implementing it is to have a separate M4A1 and an MP5, like the AR2 and the SMG1 in HL2, but the M4A1 is replaced with M16A3. The MP5 is common staple for the Black Mesa guards, and because of that they are not equipped with a grenade launcher, except the M16A3 recieves the Grenade Launcher instead.

Just like the AR2, the M16A3/M203 would have only been limited to 60 spare ammunition at maximum, while the MP5 would have that 150. Of course over the MP5, the M16A3/M203 would have 8 damage while the MP5 only has 6 despite having a slower attack speed. While the M16A3/M203 is accurate over long distances, the MP5 has higher attack speed therefore higher DPS over the M16A3/M203, and at the same time it&#39;s center speed and turn speed would have been way faster while the M16A3/M203 would have been one of the slowest, as well as the MP5 has the fastest reload speed aside from Glock 17, so it&#39;s exceptionally better at CQB.

This way, it makes a bit sense to have both guns, the army uses the assault rifle, while the security guards only use sub machine-guns. I know that this is not exactly how the original HL1 worked, but it would be nice.

Another thing that would be nice is that security guards and some scientists would pick weapons on the floor, and security guards would pick better weapons on the floor like shotgun, MP5, M16A3. I mean it would have been just idiotic not to get an upgrade in weapon or get ammunition, after all that has happened, some scientists should have thought of getting weapons since they are going to be shot at anyways.

But i&#39;m just sharing an idea.</description>

            <p>Well I installed this skin pack the other day and apparently it replaces the mp5 with the m16 so I guess the modders have already got the m16 in the game.</p>

<p>You realize they make the Beretta M9 in a 0.45 ACP version in real life, right? Or am I thinking of the 92FS? Honestly, I always thought the HD pack model looked more like a 92FS than an M9. Also, to make up for “no underwater firing”, penetrating projectiles.</p>

            <p>I don’t see the need for it unless they make the MP5 and M16 really different. Maybe if the MP5 had a faster rate of fire and 50 bullets per clip but does less damage and no alt fire and the M16 has 30 bullets per clip and can only fire in 3 round bursts but does more damage and has a grenade launcher, AND if the game had a one weapon per category limit, then I could see it.</p>

            <p>I’d like to see what was suggested in the opening post, with 2 differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MP5 keeps the grenade launcher</li>
<li>The M4 has an M9 pistol mounted under the barrel as the alt-fire. Yes, attachments that let you mount a pistol under the barrel of an M4 actually exist.</li>
</ul>

            <p>I’ve always disappointed that M4A1 is not accessible. Of course i do understand that it’s practically silly that the Glock 17 is going to share ammunition with the M4A1 which is idiotic unless the M4A1 is rechambered to use 9mm para.</p>
<p>Of course, what i think would have a great way of implementing it is to have a separate M4A1 and an MP5, like the AR2 and the SMG1 in HL2, but the M4A1 is replaced with M16A3. The MP5 is common staple for the Black Mesa guards, and because of that they are not equipped with a grenade launcher, except the M16A3 recieves the Grenade Launcher instead.</p>
<p>Just like the AR2, the M16A3/M203 would have only been limited to 60 spare ammunition at maximum, while the MP5 would have that 150. Of course over the MP5, the M16A3/M203 would have 8 damage while the MP5 only has 6 despite having a slower attack speed. While the M16A3/M203 is accurate over long distances, the MP5 has higher attack speed therefore higher DPS over the M16A3/M203, and at the same time it’s center speed and turn speed would have been way faster while the M16A3/M203 would have been one of the slowest, as well as the MP5 has the fastest reload speed aside from Glock 17, so it’s exceptionally better at CQB.</p>
<p>This way, it makes a bit sense to have both guns, the army uses the assault rifle, while the security guards only use sub machine-guns. I know that this is not exactly how the original HL1 worked, but it would be nice.</p>
<p>Another thing that would be nice is that security guards and some scientists would pick weapons on the floor, and security guards would pick better weapons on the floor like shotgun, MP5, M16A3. I mean it would have been just idiotic not to get an upgrade in weapon or get ammunition, after all that has happened, some scientists should have thought of getting weapons since they are going to be shot at anyways.</p>
<p>But i’m just sharing an idea.</p>
