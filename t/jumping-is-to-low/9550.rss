</aside>
<p>If you were able to read, you had read that I have no problems with crouch jumping. And it is OK for what you described somewhere else (jumping through windows, etc…). In Half Life 1 it was right. You had to crouch jump here and there where it was needed but not to jump onto a small step.</p>
<p>But for jumping up small steps it is hindering the flow slightly and is nothing but an unneeded additional key.</p>
<p>And for your info. I am not a COD fan, I am an old school gamer and a game developer (buy the Rise of the Triad remake from Steam later this year and watch the credits, then you know what I mean and what I develop, kiddie). And from a developer’s point of view additional keys for simple actions are a bad design decision. For additional actions and special jumps it is OK. That way I got among the top UT players, a game which has much, much more advanced movement than any HL game or mod and are ranked number 1 (alongside others) at the fast paced Shootmania beta with it’s stamina movement.</p>

<p>Quick question:  Can you personally jump onto a 3-4 foot box by simply standing upright and jumping?  Alright, maybe you can.  Can you do that and land in a fully upright position?  No.  Just no.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The jumps I’m talking about aren’t anywhere near that high. They’re two feet at the most, yet Gordon is unable to make them in this game unless he crouches mid-jump. And more to the point, can you cave in a monster’s skull with a crowbar? Because that’s about as connected to what happens in the game as what my jumping abilities have to do with those of our fictional protagonist.</p>

<p>Crouch-jumping is meant to simulate the fact that you can’t just jump and land upright on something just because your feet cleared it.  At least, that’s how I’ve always interpreted it.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Now please add two keys for walking. One for left and one for right leg. That would add even more.</p>
<p>I don’t have a hard time pressing two keys. But it is unneeded. At least in 90% of all cases. In HL I had to crouch jump here and there, not to walk up some stairs.<br>
I know you wanted to modernize the game to a time where games like Gears of War and Bulletstorm don’t allow jumping at all, but this only adds useless keypressing and breaking the flow a bit.</p>

<p>I’d like to second the complaints. I’ve been playing for a few hours now, and the jump is frustratingly useless unless you crouch. I understand that there were <span class="bbcode-b">some</span> points in the original game where you had to crouch-jump, but it was not constantly required. Users should not be forced to press two keys to get use out of their jump, and with how weak the jump key alone is right now, I have not been able to get any success with it.</p>
<p>The original Half-Life had a <span class="bbcode-i">useful</span> jump, and a <span class="bbcode-i">powerful</span> crouch-jump. This mod has a <span class="bbcode-i">useless</span> jump and a <span class="bbcode-i">passable</span> crouch-jump. Please fix this feature.</p>

<p>…basically, it sucks balls. While most everything else has been awesome, this has frustrated me in EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER. I don’t care what the reasoning behind it is, if it’s a bad game mechanic, it’s a bad game mechanic. Simple as that.</p>

            <p>I think it’s ok. In HL2 you had to crouch to get on barrels and same applies here.</p>
<p>It would also be hard to change now, when levels are all designed - this could allow you to get into places, where you wouldnt be allowed otherwise.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Perhaps, a part of realism went out, but not everything. Otherwise, we would have got a main character breathing fire and officers of security dancing with fish, or something crazy like that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>What really was sad for me personally is that in some areas it’s impossible for your friends to follow you, and you’re forced to leave them to their imminent death  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>It would be better if they were able to overcome at least some obstacles in a way…</p>

It’s more realistic this way, I think. For example, I can’t jump on a crate like that in real life - I’d be forced to somehow climb on it anyway, and I’m in a good shape myself  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>It’s less that it’s hard and more that it feels like an extra key press being required for no good reason. Why can’t both the jump and crouch-jump be stronger?</p>

<p>I was seriously annoyed by how small the jumping was, and if you read it I did say that I knew about crouch jumping but found it silly that I had to do this to jump on a box…</p>

            <p>I’d like to second the complaints. I’ve been playing for a few hours now, and the jump is frustratingly useless unless you crouch. I understand that there were <span class="bbcode-b">some</span> points in the original game where you had to crouch-jump, but it was not constantly required. Users should not be forced to press two keys to get use out of their jump, and with how weak the jump key alone is right now, I have not been able to get any success with it.</p>
<p>The original Half-Life had a <span class="bbcode-i">useful</span> jump, and a <span class="bbcode-i">powerful</span> crouch-jump. This mod has a <span class="bbcode-i">useless</span> jump and a <span class="bbcode-i">passable</span> crouch-jump. Please fix this feature.</p>
