    <title>Constant crash after play c1a4c (giant fan)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/constant-crash-after-play-c1a4c-giant-fan/11021</link>
    <description>First of all, sorry for my bad English.
I got crash after turning on the giant fan in map bm_c1a4c. After trying many solution, i finally can turn on the fan without crash (kill the zombie and smash everything). But, after i turn on the fan and &quot;fly&quot; to some kind of air tunnel above (sorry, idk what this is called) the game crash as soon as i enter it.

So, i use console command to jump to map bm_c2a1a after like 10-20 time i can&#39;t get through the tunnel. But the game still crash on this map. As soon as i get to where some of the HECU soldier shooting something, the game freeze and crash, i have no idea why, it&#39;s on another map, not on c1a4c. 

Can i have any solution for this???</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I found that the problem is caused by having a box or barrel or something fall INTO the fan. It may even happen if you smash boxes and some pieces fall into the fan. To get past the fan bit I had to load a save (I think there was an autosave when entering the fan area) and then make sure to get down the controls without hitting anything or smashing anything. Then it worked OK.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if there are any boxes/barrels/pallets around once the fan is on - they will float up. The problem is caused by objects falling underneath the fan, I think the game doesn’t know what to do with things that are underneath the fan that is supposed to send them upwards.</p>
<p>If you are able to activate the fan and fly upwards you shouldn’t have any problem with “save file corruption”. If no objects fall into the fan, you won’t get crashes.</p>

            <p>I’m having the same problem with the fan on Blast pit it always crashes when I turn the fan on. <em>Edit I’ll try too destroy all the pallets and boxes</em> Edit: That fixed the problem but I can’t save until I’m out of the area with the fan or my save file will become corrupt.</p>

<p>People, why don’t you try using forum search function? Of even easier, why don’t you try to at least take a look into the threads titles on the first page of the “In-game issues” forum? This issue had been reported more than any other, there’s a known workaround for it that seems to work for most players. Please, please, please try searching before you post and don’t force devs into a situation when they are flooded with basically the same reports scattered over 100500 threads. Sorry for a bit of rant here but I’m somewhat tired this evening having to type in the same “already reported, please use search” mantra over and over again :-).</p>

            <p>So yes, destroy all palettes and toss the barrels into the pit before starting the fan.  You’ll be happy with the results.</p>
<p>See, if you post the actual answer, instead of being snarky, people might actually listen and not get fed up going through 20 threads of “Search, idiot” before just posting their own.</p>

            <p>Same issue: "Memory in location 0x[…] could not be ‘read’. "<br>
Exception thrown at the moment when I am supposed to lift off of the platform.<br>
I don’t know if it’s a graphics, audio, or other type of problem, but none of my drivers are out-of-date.  My brother said there was a Source update, so that may have thrown things off.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the first time I reached the fan, I was able to get lift-off and went to the top of the chamber, but ended up dying before the next auto-save, so I went back to the previous auto-save (a long way back), and ended up quick-saving right before hitting the switch for the turbine.<br>
The first time it crashed, I was holding on to the ladder, so I thought it was that, but every subsequent time, I’ve been just standing on the platform on the side.</p>
