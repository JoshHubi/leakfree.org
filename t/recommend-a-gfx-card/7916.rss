    <title>Recommend a GFX Card.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/recommend-a-gfx-card/7916</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got a budget of £75 (Can push to £110) that I can spend, just wondering what GFX Cards you think would be best within that price range for my computer?

Currently I have the (base) ATI Radeon HD5450 and these are my computer specs/info;


* Dell Inspiron 560MT
* Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q8300 @ 2.50GHz
* Memory: DDR3 8GB
* 64-bit OS.
* Windows 7 Home Premium
* Graphic Interface: x16 (Link width and Max supported.)
* Native Res: 1920x1080


If there&#39;s any more info needed, just ask, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s needed but I hope everything in that list covers it. :3

Appreciate any suggestions.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thanks guys for your help, I’ve decided to go with the 5770. Since it’s a budget choice and enough to support what I play on my PC.</p>
<p>Sometime in the future I’ll have more money to pay for a higher end card.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help and sorry for dragging this on to 3 pages.</p>
<p>However, if I do manage to earn a bit more money in the next 2 weeks I’ll go with the 550Ti.</p>

            <p>Scratch what I said earlier-- the 6790 pulls less than the 550ti apparently, but not less than the 5770 (by a small margin). I don’t remember what site I was on when I made that last post but I assume I read the info incorrectly. It does require two 6-pin pci-e cables, but a molex-to-pci-e adapter would solve that issue as the power requirements are still reasonable.</p>
<p>The 5770 would be my budget choice though if I could find a good cheap unit. They were very popular, and plenty should be available used as people upgrade their components.</p>

            <p>It’s actually impossible to find your PC’s power supply wattage rating programmatically.  You have to open it up and look inside.  First, though, try looking at the back of your case; sometimes the wattage is printed on the back of the PSU, where it will show through the case.  If you can’t find a wattage anywhere, find a serial number and google it.</p>

<p>Actually looking at the PSU will be the easiest way to find the specs.</p>
<p>If they are priced evenly then go with the GTX 550 Ti, otherwise just go with the better deal.</p>
<p>[i]Side note the HD 6790 actually uses slightly less power than the GTX 550 Ti, though reference design calls for 2 6pin PCI-e connectors, and it is about 10% faster, whereas the HD 5770 and the GTX 550 Ti performance difference falls in-between a margin of error.</p>
<p>As for the GTX 460, they run very cool and even at reference design they don’t come near breaking 80c, their power consumption in comparison to their competition is slightly higher, but more than acceptable.[/i]</p>

            <p>More than likely you’ll need to open your case and look at it physically. Shouldn’t be that big an issue, since you’re going to need to open your case to put the video card in there anyway.</p>

            <p>Be careful-- when you were looking for very low-budget cards it was one thing, but if you start looking at the gtx 460 and other similar cards you need to make sure that your power supply can handle it. The gtx 4xx series was very power hungry and produced a lot of heat; the 5xx series is better but more expensive as it is a newer generation.</p>
<p>I would recommend a 550ti if you can find one at a discount, otherwise a 5770 (even though it performs worse; the 6790 is the 550ti’s performance competitor, but draws a LOT more power than either the 550ti or 5770, and isn’t as good of a value IMO). Both draw relatively little power, require only one PCI-E connector, and have good performance. The 550ti is better than the 5770, but either one would serve you very well.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">On a side note with the HD 6000 series, except for the rebranded cards like the HD 6770 and 6750, ATI has been completely removed and the GPU’s are now marketed as AMD.</span></p>

            <p>If I were you, I’d completely ignore the 400 series, go with the 500. It may be a tad more expensive, but it runs significantly cooler and my 560 destroys everything I’ve played on it.</p>

            <p>Ah I believe I’ve only got 1 6pin PCI-e power connector, will have to double check that.<br>
Sorry for making this thread really long since I’m pretty bad and deciding what to get, I’d just like to get the best for my computer for possibly £100. What other specs would you need aside from what I’ve listed in the OP to determine the best graphics card?</p>

            <p>When I put the side of my case on, I have ~1mm clearanve between my sidefan and the top of my CPU cooler  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  I suddenly see why people buy full ATX cases…but I never would, portability is an issue.</p>

<p>Sorry for the double post;</p>
<p>Just measured my current graphics card, it’s 17 centimetres in width and 20 millimetres high.<br>
(Item Height: 20mm<br>
Item Width: 17cm)</p>
<p>The 6790 is:<br>
Item Height: 6 centimetres<br>
Item Width: 25 centimetres</p>
<p>The 550Ti is:<br>
Item Height: 40 millimetres<br>
Item Width: 11.1 centimetres</p>
<p>The 550Ti would fit without a doubt, but I’m not sure about the 6790, it may be too big. I tried measuring inside my case and it might just fit, but I’m concerned whether it would clash with anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Depends on how the inside of the case is setup, but also make sure there is enough room at the back of the card to plug in the 6pin PCI-e connector.</p>

            <p>I might go for the 6790, either that or the 550 Ti.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks I might have a little bit more budget so I’ll wait and see as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help guys, I appreciate it, if I don’t get an increased budget I’ll choose between the 6790 or the 550 Ti, if I do get an increase in budget then I’ll post that here.</p>

            <p>The HD 5870 is more than double the overall performance of the HD 5770, a couple other cards to consider may be the HD 6790 and GTX 460 768MB.</p>
<p>GTS 450 -&gt; HD 5770 -&gt; GTX 550 Ti -&gt; HD 6790 -&gt; GTX 460 768MB -&gt; HD 6850 = GTX 460 1GB</p>

            <p>I have a 5870 and it’s fantastic, though I’m not sure if it’s within your price range. But even a little less (not sure how the 5770 compares to it) would still be a very good GPU.</p>

<p>You always take a chance with refurbished cards, but you can find good deals, provided it was properly tested and approved it should work to its specification.</p>

<p>So now judging from those I’m choosing between the 5770 or the 550.</p>
<p>Does anybody know much on the 6770?</p>

<p>Found a review, in most benchmarks the 6770 was slightly slower than the 5770 (which confuses me): <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=sapphire_hd6770&amp;num=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=sapphire_hd6770&amp;num=1</a></p>
