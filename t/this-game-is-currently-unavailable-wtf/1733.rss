    <title>This game is currently unavailable WTF</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/this-game-is-currently-unavailable-wtf/1733</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m having a problem with steam since about 2 weeks and I&#39;m really pissed. Everytime I want to play Counter-Strike : Source, it says &quot;This game is currently unavailable. Please try again later.&quot;. I already had this problem with some games, but I just had to delete the ClientRegistry.blob in the steam folder to make it work again, but this time it doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;m having this problem only with Counter-Strike : Source, every other game works fine. If you know how to fix this out...</description>

            <p>Right click CSS on your desktop, click “Open File Location”</p>
<p>Go to steamapps&gt;<em>YOURNAME</em>&gt; Counter Strike Source</p>
<p>Delete the folder called “Cstrike”.</p>
<p>This should cause Steam to reload you a fresh copy of CSS the next time you try to launch it. If this doesn’t work, play something else.</p>
