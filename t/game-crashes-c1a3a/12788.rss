    <title>Game crashes @ C1A3A</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-c1a3a/12788</link>
    <description>Hi, my game crashes in level C1A3A, when I&#39;m entering the water flooded floor at the opened elevator chamber, shortly before the first troopers are appearing. I searched for the minidump file, but nothing like this exists on my system.....I was also not able to locate that folder you specified...  :frowning: 

I ran BM on a DELL Laptop with a nvidia GeForce GT650M.

I tried already to de-active all graphic performance options, but no success.</description>
