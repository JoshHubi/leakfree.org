    <description>I currently have Windows 7 build 7057 on my comp and I was wondering if I should get the new RC or just stay with my build. Some preformace comparisons would be helpful if anyone can find one.</description>

<p>I played HL2 when it just came out on my PC at the time was a dual-slot board with two 600mhz pentium3’s and a geforce 4 MX. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Everybody thought I had an insane gaming rig but it was just an old server, hl2 played pretty badly on it, even with 768mb of ram… I tried to rig the bios to work with two 1ghz coppermines but I broke the board in the process  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>That test was done with build 7000, the current official build is the Release Candidate or build 7100. When my system is just on the desktop with no programs running it used 20% of my RAM on build 7000 and 12% on build 7100 (if u didn’t take the time to look at my previous posts, I have 8 gigs of RAM).</p>

</aside>
<p>I have run Windows 7 build 7000, 7057, and 7100 on my backup laptop that I use for gaming and work when my desktop is down, and it runs fine. My laptop is a Dell XPS m1710 formula red edition (i know its a little dated but its my backup) and it runs HL2 at 100fps at 1900x1200 with all setting maxed out except vsync with build 7100. The preformance and compatibility increase between 7000 and 7057 is big enough that its worth the hassle of reinstalling windows, but don’t expect to be blown away by the boost either. The increase also depends on what hardware your running aswell, like me for instance my desktop is pretty high end so gaming performance was pretty high to start out with so the increase was tiny. My laptop however is in the middle to low range area so the increase in performance was much bigger.</p>

<p>As someone who works on Macs every day I have to strongly disagree with you.  Apple has forsaken their once strong high end support and preference for the Mass market - reflected through use of broken updates and a needless bloated interface. The internal war against Adobe is annoying though explains the performance gains on the PC version.  OSX is good for emails and OK for browsing if you use Firefox.  The many Adobe and Quark bugs are just ridiculous - probably due to the frequent OSX revisions and the reason I have switch to the PC for such tasks.</p>
<p>Windows 7 has a massive following and saying it will fail is bizarre.  Vista sold more copies than OSX has in existence in under two weeks.</p>
<p>The Macs dock isn’t sexy and the Win7 one is nothing like it.  Merely a progression from the XP one.  I have all the fancy effects turned off in OSX so it is pretty much just a shortcut bar - bouncing icons can drive you nuts.</p>
<p>As I type this I have sent the 345th crash report to Quark.</p>
<p>If you are gaming on Win7 make sure you get the latest nvidia Windows 7 drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Look, I really appreciate this response. It’s a very well supported statement, and I’m actually starting to think I’ll like Windows 7 more than previously conceived. I also appreciate your politeness.</p>
<p>Also, I’m a gamer, and I am constantly updating my 280’s drivers  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Nvidia is great about that, aren’t they?</p>

<p>That´s i wanna say.<br>
Cuz it´s NOT only a Vista with better taskbar<br>
Yes it´s based on Vista, but Win7 is going to be that what XP was for us 8 Years now.<br>
The Base-Code is cleaned up, it runs much smoother than Vista AND XP<br>
Most features that sucks in Vista are recreated and now really Good.<br>
Example:UAC sucked in Vista, now it´s much better and i am going to use it in Final.<br>
Plus the new Features it´s great.<br>
And the most important thing is. It´s the stable´st Windows i ever saw.</p>
<p>So Dillxn, test somewhat before you say sh*t about it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I will actually download it and test it out on vmware, just because now I’m so interested. Especially since you say it’s made improvements over Vista. My one question is, does it consume the same or less resources than XP? Because if not, then I’m sticking with XP for as long as possible.<br>
Please, though, let’s try to have a civil discussion rather than a flamewar.</p>

Assuming that this graph is more or less correct, lets calculate the numbers.<br>
Round windows up to using 95% percent of the market share, and OS X up to 5%. So, that means, if every 1 in 19 or more people has downloaded and installed Windows 7, then they have more then the entire mac population.</p>
<p>1 in every 19? I highly doubt this. I’m guessing that either you or microsoft are pulling numbers out of their ass.</p>

<p>Looks like you and I have the same views. The Macintosh OS is far better than Windows, but I use Windows mainly just because I’m a gamer, and Macs aren’t made for hardcore gaming, simply because their OS isn’t open architecture. I respect Apple’s OS for what it is and does, and I respect Microsoft’s OS for what it is and does. They each have their strongpoints. And I also dual boot Fedora 10, it’s niceeeeeeee.</p>
<p>Anyways, back on subject, I haven’t used Windows 7 and from what I’ve see, it’s just Vista but with a different taskbar to behave more like the Mac’s dock, except not quite as sexy. I really doubt that it will take off, in fact I think it will do just as poorly as Vista, unless they really advertise it like crazy.</p>
<p>The problem with Microsoft’s advertising is that they mimicked Apple’s “I’m a Mac / Pc” line. Now, the “I’m a Mac” works for Apple, because ‘Mac’ describes only one thing, and that is their product, and nothing else. But when Microsoft used the “I’m a Pc” line in their advertising, they didn’t consider that the term ‘Pc’ covers far more than just their products, which, I believe, is why they should have just advertised a specific Operating System instead of a general term. This isn’t to say they didn’t advertise Vista any, they did, I just think they should have made it more clear in all of their commercials / advertisements.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say I’m a Vista or Microsoft fan, I’m most certainly not, in fact I tend to use the Apple equivalent as much as I can, and only use Windows when I’m forced to. Each company has their own thing going for them, and both should be respected as such.</p>

<p>As someone who works on Macs every day I have to strongly disagree with you.  Apple has forsaken their once strong high end support and preference for the Mass market - reflected through use of broken updates and a needless bloated interface. The internal war against Adobe is annoying though explains the performance gains on the PC version.  OSX is good for emails and OK for browsing if you use Firefox.  The many Adobe and Quark bugs are just ridiculous - probably due to the frequent OSX revisions and the reason I have switch to the PC for such tasks.</p>
<p>Windows 7 has a massive following and saying it will fail is bizarre.  Vista sold more copies than OSX has in existence in under two weeks.</p>
<p>The Macs dock isn’t sexy and the Win7 one is nothing like it.  Merely a progression from the XP one.  I have all the fancy effects turned off in OSX so it is pretty much just a shortcut bar - bouncing icons can drive you nuts.</p>
<p>As I type this I have sent the 345th crash report to Quark.</p>
<p>If you are gaming on Win7 make sure you get the latest nvidia Windows 7 drivers.</p>

<p>I don’t see why people hate on Apple. Their systems are overpriced, but their operating system is so much better then Microsoft. And the systems are over priced, but have you seen some of those nifty features that they have? Key’s that get backlit when it’s dark built into the laptops?</p>

            <p>I am running the RC 7100 build. DX11 also causes graphical problems with Doom 3 and any other game runs with black bars on the sides. I am currently thinking of downgrading back to vista. I just don’t want to lose my files.</p>

            <p>Damn Windows 7 and its incompatibilities, I can only run steam games. I cant run Homeworld 2, C&amp;C Generals (Dont have DX 8.1 lol?), CoD4 (PB doesnt know what Win7 is), or NFS: Carbon. Now I am sure all I have to do is update PB and i can play CoD4 again but I cant play the other games even with the compatibility mode set.</p>
<p>If there are any ways around this that would be much appreciated. Thank you in advanced.</p>

            <p>Ok I decided to switch to RC and so far I see it uses less RAM then build 7057 and its more compatible. Besides that its exactly the same.</p>

            <p>Updated my Vista 64 with the Windows 7 build.  Looks nice and games nice.<br>
Love the updated Taskbar and Libraries features - Glad they didn’t go the bloated OSX way.</p>
<p>Never had an issue with Vista though Windows 7 seems slightly quicker in general - Especially after using it for a few days - must prioritise commonly run tasks a bit better than Vista did.</p>
