    <title>What Was the First Video Game You Ever Played?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-was-the-first-video-game-you-ever-played/12446</link>
    <description>I&#39;m very curious about this.

The first video game I ever played was Pokémon Blue on the Game Boy. It was the same day I got the Game Boy Color when I got that game. It was really fun. I still have my Game Boy Color with me today and it works very well.</description>

<p>Super Mario World on the SNES. Probably. I’ve been playing (and, back then, also second-controller random button-mashing) game for as long as I can remember. Longer, actually.
