    <description>Don&#39;t think this has been posted yet, so imma go ahead and make this thread.

Whilst i&#39;m aware that pretty much everyone on this forum probably knows about this sale already, i thought i should post it just in case anyone had somehow overlooked it:

<p>Yeah, 5 bucks even if it sucks that’s nothing. Downloading now.</p>

            <p>Was just about to buy Mirrors Edge, but figured out I had played it enough already at a friends house and decided to skip it. Why waste money?</p>
<p>Would be better if they dropped the price on Modern Warfare 2 now since it has sold so well. They must have recouped the development cost by now. But I guess they want to cash in on it 2 years from now. MW1 has not dropped significantly after 2 years. If I can’t afford it, I can’t afford it!</p>
