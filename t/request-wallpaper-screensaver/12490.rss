    <title>Request: Wallpaper/Screensaver?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/request-wallpaper-screensaver/12490</link>
    <description>Pardon me for being new here; if this belongs in another forum please move it there.

Has anyone made (or could someone make) a wallpaper and screensaver for BMS? Meaning the Superbus Via Inscientiae wallpaper and rotating Black Mesa logo screensaver seen in-game on BMS screens.

Thanks! I&#39;m enjoying the remake quite a lot (I even liked the shortened &quot;On A Rail&quot;, although there were a couple of firefights I missed).</description>

            <p>You are very welcome folks. Remember, I am not just a Black Mesa team member, I am also a FAN!</p>
<p>=)</p>
<p>That said, I do have access to a screensaver that can work with both movie files and image files. If you have something to send to me, I would be very happy to throw it into a ss for ya.</p>
<p>email is the best way to get ahold of me.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>BM’s Facebook page has a bunch of fan-made wallpapers in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.480825848602896.113376.391087910910024&amp;type=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">an album</a>, and some of them are very good, I think.</p>
<p>There used to be an official theme pack and screensavers, linked <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=528724&amp;postcount=6" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, but they seem to be gone now, unfortunately.</p>

            <p>Welcome!</p>
<p>Nothing like that has been made to my knowledge… You may be able to find something digging though the game’s assets, though.</p>
<p>However, you can find plenty of wallpapers with the BMRF logo on it if you google “Black Mesa Wallpaper”.</p>
<p>My current wallpaper looks a lot like <a href="https://fc09.deviantart.net/fs13/f/2007/073/7/f/Black_Mesa_by_shinigami_risky.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>.</p>
