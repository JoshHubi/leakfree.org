    <title>BMS - Technically not finished.(SPOILERS)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bms-technically-not-finished-spoilers/10735</link>
    <description>For though&#39;s of you who have played BMS and completed it you know its missing a huge part of the game known as the boarder world. 

I myself am not satisfied with the fact that that I completed the game as is. Because the game it&#39;s self is missing a huge chunk of the original game, once you go through the portal to the border world. I expect to see the border world not credits and &quot;To be continued&quot; should have just added a troll face instead, I&#39;m going to assume that the game was released like this so that they could just get it out the door after years of development and setbacks. Personally I would have rather waited a few more years or months to get a complete version of the game with border world. over all still a good remake but it should be a complete game start to end like the original.</description>

            <p>I’m starting to think that most of the people now on the forums had no idea what Black Mesa or Half-Life was before the mod was released.</p>

            <p>Also it’s not like they plan to leave it like that.<br>
They already said they’d patch the missing chapters into the release when there done.<br>
Did you really want to wait years for a full release and possibly have them not offer patch support as a result ?.</p>

            <p>It’s a hobby fan project, it’s very high quality, it’s for free, you dont HAVE to play it, they annouced the missing of Xen before release.</p>
<p>Seriously? Get outta here…</p>
