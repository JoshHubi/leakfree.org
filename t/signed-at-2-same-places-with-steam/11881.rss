    <title>Signed at 2 same places with Steam</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/signed-at-2-same-places-with-steam/11881</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been chatting with a friend of mine today, and suddenly there was a questionmark.
Later we mentioned the word &quot;dubstep&quot; and he said &quot;sugi pula&quot;, which as far as I remember is Romanian or something.
I&#39;ve changed my password a couple of times, and the Steam support wont answer.
Anyone knows a solution to this, because I don&#39;t want someone messing up my account.
@Any mod - Can this be placed to Help &amp; Support?
a.k.a
Account hijacked.</description>

            <p>Word of advice: Get Ad-block plus for whatever browser you use, and get some security measures for your machine: Anti-virus, firewall, that sort. I can’t give you any suggestions.</p>
<p>Generally, <span class="bbcode-i">a lot</span> of the viruses flying around the internet you can find on ads/popups, etc. It’s why I have an ad-blocker installed on each system, it tends to get rid of most of the crap and I can browse in peace. Good luck keeping unwanted traffic out of your network.</p>

            <p>I dunno about yours, but some/many/most email services track the region and IP of each login, which means unless he’s using some proxy that’s conveniently located where you are, it should be easy enough to prove what isn’t you.</p>

            <p>The problem is that every month my bank deletes the receipts.<br>
I got proof like my old e-mail, old password and (maybe) a Portal 2 cd-key that I got from the store and that I’ve been 500+ hours in Source SDK the last few months.<br>
I think the main problem that he got into my account is because my internet security  subscription on my notebook has been ended.<br>
I hope this problem gets solved.<br>
The one who logged in is a Romanian since he used Romanian swearwords during my chats, which I thought was my little brother messing with my chats.</p>

            <p>Did you try jiggling the cable?</p>
<p>If you have enough information to prove it is in fact your account, then you should be able to get your account back nice and secure before the week ends. Steam support can be pretty slow, but they aren’t a huge hassle to work with. Do you save the “receipts” that Steam gives you when you make purchases? Stuff like that helps a lot when proving you’re the owner.</p>
<p>Or if it’s something as simple as the hijacker logging in from a different country than is usual that usually is a red flag for them.</p>

            <p>My e-mail account also got hacked, since he had the chance to apply to code for the password change.<br>
Changed everything in my email though, but I’m really wondering if Steam support will believe me.<br>
But I was on mobile Steam, chatting with people when suddenly messages appeared I did not typed.<br>
The bastard also deleted all my friends, so I’m not able to see where my account is.</p>

<p>^Lol<br>
I’m insured for fraud, and logging into my bank requires a special generator.<br>
The problem is that a username can also be used, which I don’t have since its a sub account of my father and I’m worried they can see my bank number.</p>

            <p>So I’ve been chatting with a friend of mine today, and suddenly there was a questionmark.<br>
Later we mentioned the word “dubstep” and he said “sugi pula”, which as far as I remember is Romanian or something.<br>
I’ve changed my password a couple of times, and the Steam support wont answer.<br>
Anyone knows a solution to this, because I don’t want someone messing up my account.<br>
<span class="mention">@Any</span> mod - Can this be placed to Help &amp; Support?<br>
