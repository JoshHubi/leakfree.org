    <title>Continuous Half-Life experience</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/continuous-half-life-experience/10956</link>
    <description>I&#39;d very much like to see a patch for Black Mesa, Half-Life 2, and the episodes, that creates a continuous experience between BM and the sequels.

The changes would mostly be effects and features of BM copied over to HL2, but also a couple of tweaks to BM to make it more like HL2.

I&#39;d also like it to be based on the [url=https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1093025]unofficial HL2 Update[/url], that basically fixes the port to the OB engine. Probably best to wait for version 3, which apparently will be coming out sometime this year.

These kinds of changes are what I have in mind:
[b]Black Mesa:[/b]
[INDENT]
-Adjust the vertical jump speed and movement speeds to be the same as in HL2
-Adjust magnum, vortigaunt, zombie stats etc. to reflect HL2
-...
[/INDENT]

[b]Half-Life 2/eps:[/b]
[INDENT]
-Use the BM test chamber in the opening sequence
-Replace models: Icthyosaur, SLAM in HL2DM with gluon gun, and tau cannon (buggy)
-Replace sounds: hit sounds, jumping and landing on surfaces, footsteps, ...
-Implement new features from BM: deathcam, Face Creation System, gib system
-Implement new graphical effects from BM: Chromatic Abberation on hit, noise near radioactivity, drowning effects, blood/goo sticking on viewmodel
-Gameplay mechanics: make it possible to harm friendly NPCs, and implement the same behaviour when harming them as in BM; NPC Dynamic Interaction System from Ep1; pick-up and throw as in BM; lower weapon while sprinting; view bob/roll; make it possible to pick up small ragdolls, such as the headcrab
[/INDENT]

NOTE: I&#39;m not taking feasibility in account with this list. I&#39;ll need some feedback on that :p

That&#39;s about all I can think of off the top of my head, but I&#39;ll add more if I think of something.
I&#39;ll also edit the list to reflect outcomes of discussions in this thread, if any.

Most of those are simple asset replacements and config edits, but the last one may not be possible, since we don&#39;t have access to the code, as far as I know.

This patch should not contain any assets, it should just copy them from the user&#39;s installations of the various games, insofar as they are available.

I may have a crack at it myself once the unofficial HL2 update v3 is released.

Any thoughts?  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>You’re probably right, probably not worth the hassle. Other than that there’s nothing else that has been changed in BM, either, I think, so the Vort is probably fine as it is.</p>
<p>I didn’t even have the SDK installed :retard: Don’t judge, I’m new at this :3</p>
<p>Too bad about the script files <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> It’ll probably be necessary to make this a mod anyway, if we want to get the noise effect and such in.</p>
<p>edit: Aaaaahhhh, I tried changing the FOV angle in XSI and recompiling, but the magnum is invisible now. I’m too much of a noob at this.</p>

            <p>If they did, I don’t think it’s noticeable. The main difference is the shackle texture.</p>
<p>Do you have the Source SDK open when you’re using it? It doesn’t seem to work for me if I don’t, IIRC.</p>
<p>Custom script files don’t appear to work since the update, unfortunately - the GCF overrides them. It’s weird, since they work fine in everything else. It’d probably have to be in a mod for them to work. :\</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to put them in the same folder structure that there were in before (so the vort textures would be in hl2\materials\models\vortigaunt). And yeah, the collared version is a separate model and is only used in certain circumstances, like the sweeper vort at the beginning of HL2. BM altered the shackles texture a bit, but the vort itself is unchanged from Ep2.</p>
<p>On closer inspection it looks like BM’s crowbar uses the same material name for the red bit, but its head material has a different name (“head.vmt” instead of “head_uvw.vmt” that the old model uses). So basically if you extract “head_uvw.vmt” from the 2007 GCF, put it into the appropriate folder and rename it to “head.vmt”, you should get the original skin with the new animation.</p>
<p>I think not everything has been replaced in the 2007 GCFs, so things use the old ones if there’s not a new version somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They did change the Vort’s texture though, I believe. I’ll look into it later.</p>
<p>I thought it would be something like that for the crowbar. Shouldn’t be a problem then.</p>
<p>I’m currently trying to get the magnum model into XSI so I can adjust the FOV, but Cannonfodder’s Studiocompiler keeps crashing when I try to decompile  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Also, script files don’t seem to be loading properly. I did put them in hl2\scripts, and the filenames are the same. It’s necessary to get the sounds working.<br>
Well, I could just rename the sound files, I guess. But getting the scripts to load would be a lot better.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the vorts don’t do that much damage with their standard attack in Ep2, which is the only time you really see them fight much. I don’t think they usually even kill antlions outright, which I guess is so you can finish them off yourself.</p>

<p>Edit: ok, apparently, HL2 uses a separate FOV for viewmodels, and BM doesn’t. So in order to correctly display these models, you’d have to change viewmodel_fov for the magnum and crowbar separately. Ideal solution would be to change the FOV of the model itself, I’m going to see if I can.</p>

<p>im pretty sure post-hl2 vorts 1-shot everything but large synths, the values are probably obsolete configs from older games.</p>

There appears to be no movement speed or jump distance (horizontal) cvar in BM, and conversely no jump speed or distance cvar in HL2.<br>
You can’t enable friendly fire in HL2 without an actual mod (i.e. no cvar), and there’s no cvar for throwing distance or view bob/roll either.</p>

<p>Cool. I have zero experience with Source (other than playing the games), so I really appreciate the input.</p>
<p>Glad to hear most of that should be rather simple. I’m planning to check every BM asset to see if it has a counter-part in HL2. I’ll also recheck the configs for the episodes for stats, since I only really checked the one for HL2.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll be able to do much of this other than asset replacement and config edits, though. Would be really cool if we could make this into something downloadable.</p>

<p>I think the convars are pretty much the same in both other than the Vortigaunt attack damage (as far as is relevant to Black Mesa, anyway).</p>
<p>I might be able to do the test-chamber replacement; depends if I have time.</p>

<p>Well, the idea is to make Black Mesa feel like it’s just the first chapter of the HL2 series.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s quite different because of all the new effects and such that have been implemented into BM.</p>
<p>Essentially, the idea is to make everything that overlaps between BM and HL2 the same, so as to create a feeling of continuity. Right now they look and play like different games for the most part, while they’re actually part of the same series.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think that it is ok for them being different. The games have different meanings, and different stuff is happening. The gameplay only mirrors that. To change gameplay of Black Mesa or Half Life 2 to make them “look(feel) a like” would be a bad thing. Developers had already a lot of headaches trying to design those worlds, so let it be.</p>

</aside>
<p>I really don’t understand those suggestions. Why do you want to do these?<br>
Just for emphasis, I belive the best is not to mess with the gameplay elements from each game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Also , this talk gave me an idea. Wouldn’t it be awsome an “Ultimate” Half Life Universe Deathmatch version? By that I mean, after the release of Black Mesa: Death Match , someone would take all weapons from Black Mesa, all weapons from HL2 , and all cut weapons from HL2 Beta (Missing Information mod),the super Gravity Gun, and a Portal Gun, and make all of this into a DeathMatch game?</span> That would be so sweet :awesome: …</p>
<p>[Edit: The idea came to me while thinking, what would be the multiplayer mode of an ‘all half life games in one’ game.]</p>

            <p>Cool. I have zero experience with Source (other than playing the games), so I really appreciate the input.</p>
<p>Glad to hear most of that should be rather simple. I’m planning to check every BM asset to see if it has a counter-part in HL2. I’ll also recheck the configs for the episodes for stats, since I only really checked the one for HL2.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll be able to do much of this other than asset replacement and config edits, though. Would be really cool if we could make this into something downloadable.</p>
<p>I’m going to check this stuff out properly when I have the time  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>-Use the BM test chamber in the opening sequence</p>

<p>-Gameplay mechanics: make it possible to harm friendly NPCs, and implement the same behaviour when harming them as in BM;</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]This should be relatively simple, but may require some scripting. The citizens already have lines regarding friendly-fire, which is unused in the final game.</p>

<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]You’d need to add new animations for this.</p>

<p>Well, maybe you’re right, although I definitely think they’re too weak in BM as is. I’m having my doubts about changing the Ichthy stats too, since it doesn’t appear as an actual enemy in any of the HL2 games, and so those stats are meaningless.<br>
Do you agree with the zombie changes though?</p>
