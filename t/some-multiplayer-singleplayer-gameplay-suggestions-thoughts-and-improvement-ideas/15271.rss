    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-multiplayer-singleplayer-gameplay-suggestions-thoughts-and-improvement-ideas/15271</link>
    <description>After spending some great time in MP/SP, I have decided post a list of few things in my head, that could make better gameplay experience. I would appreciate some feedback/opinions from players or devs.

1)  Adding gameplay option to disable weapons equip priority in MP. I have killed myself or been killed many times because of picking up random weapons during intensive combat.

2)  Suspending mouse1,2 pressed button when ammo is depleted or weapon switched. Another way player can easily kill himself, for example: while throwing snarks, shortly after last one is depleted, another weapon  is equipped and shoots immediately (RPG, SMG grenade, tripmine, crossbow) and unintended explosion usually harms or kills player.

3)  Picking up weapon should also reload clip (at least in SP). Example: player has depleted revolver 0|0 and finds another one with ammo pack. After picking up all items (revolver+ammo) ends up only with 6|6  ammo and not full 6|12, because the old weapon needs to be reloaded instead picking up new one.

4)  Adding small  autobalance TDM. I have experienced lot of imbalanced games where players refuse to join weaker team, leading to 5v1 or 7v2 games, forcing weaker players to leave.

5)  Hivehand&#39;s hornets, grenades and satchels can kill player instantly in some elevators. Those objects act like kinda solid materials and kills player on bump collision. This behavior seems to be found only on collision-type of elevators (Crossfire, Subtransit). Not sure if it can be fixed because of engine logic, but I would appreciate any info.

6)  This one needs some discussion. I have some feeling that Tau is a little overpowered. It is the ultimate powerful weapon. Also lot of servers have Tau disabled. It has high damage, instant projectile speed, walls penetration, high accuracy, no ammo reload and brings player high mobility. It could use some small nerf, for example slowly reducing accuracy after 4-5 seconds when fully charged - even the weapon animation shows overcharge recoil from unstable weapon&#39;s state. This could bring little balance to players flying over map with always loaded and accurate Tau.</description>

            <p>Right now you can snipe 100 health / 100 armor on around mid range by clicking RMB once.</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t a wider spread make it useless at anything other than point-blank range though? Every video game shotgun I’ve ever used that has a (n unrealistically, I might add) massive spread cone has been absolute trash as a mid-range or longer weapon.</p>

            <p>No, it won’t, that’s what the wider cone is for. But it will make it more consistent in close combat. Right now it’s pretty much RNG.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wouldn’t fixed pattern make it more snipe weapon? I think spread is balanced well, double-shot has slower ROF and you have to switch another weapon if target is more than 10m away. But I agree that some indoor maps makes some advantage to shotgun, even more for shotgun+longjump combo.</p>
<p>For RPG I would be happy for just fixing those bugs such as 180, laser, fast reload glitch and sudden mid-air blowups.</p>
<p>SMG: I would add small grey trail for grenades to spot them sooner.</p>

            <p>I’d increase the reload time for RPG. I can just fire a rocket, reload in 1 second, quick switch, fire again. Only turds use laser guidance.</p>
<p>Here are my suggestions:<br>
RPG: Slower reload, slightly less explosive radius. It should be a powerful weapon considering 1 single explosive arrow explode the rocket and kill a 100hp/100ap guy who fired it. Also fix 180 rockets.<br>
Shotgun: Wider cone because you can snipe 100hp/100ap on mid range via headshots, remove random spread and use fixed pattern like in team fortress 2.<br>
Crossbow: I feel like reload could be slower. It reloads as soon as the clip is inserted, and the next half of the animation where you pull? It’s completely irrelevant now. Right now it’s a quickscope machine, unarmored has no chance.<br>
MP5: 3 nades is kinda cheap. Lower to 2?</p>
<p>The biggest elephant in the room…</p>
<p>TAU: Well for start it shouldn’t do 200dmg in 1.5 seconds…The biggest reason why completely mediocre players can dominate is exactly this.</p>
<ol>
<li>200 dmg in 1.5 seconds (x3 with headshot just to make sure the guy is dead). Even quarter-charged shots are deadly to 100hp/20-30ap.</li>
<li>Hitscan, can’t dodge it</li>
<li>Bounding box (going to be fixed but I still think it will make no difference)</li>
<li>Best sniper, best shotgun, best SMG</li>
<li>Wall penetration</li>
<li>Fly via Tau jumps, essentially making 80% weapons useless, while raining down Tau</li>
<li>AOE damage in water. Why aim?</li>
<li>Can kill multiple enemies</li>
<li>Unlimited ammo due to map design, usually 2xTau, and 100 max ammo.</li>
<li>Doesn’t need to reload.</li>
<li>Charge sound mutes out, can’t hear it around corners/when flying.</li>
<li>No danger to the user, unless holding RMB for 5+ seconds?..</li>
<li>Pushback. Because fuck anyone who tries to escape.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s the ultimate noob gun and I have no idea how you’d fix something as this  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Why would you like to have selfgauss? It’s absolutely random and stupid punishment for players that try to control major items of the game. In my opinion Tau cannon should stay the strongest and most useful weapon in the game because it gives players something to fight for and to control. My bet is that Tau Cannon will be a lot less effective with the new hitbox fix and since there isn’t much wallgauss in this game, I don’t think further nerfing is a good idea. But really I think the best way would be to make all weapons, ammolimits and multiplayer gameplay mechanics just exactly like in Adrenaline Gamer, since that game currently still has the biggst competetive Half-Life Multiplayer community of all Half-Life games… It works, it’s fun, it’s perfectly fast, skillfull and balanced. Anyway I’m excited to see any Updates concerning Multiplayer gameplay after Xen is released. I really hope the Devs will continue working on MP…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Selfgauss is very easily preventable and hardly random, all you have to do is one of three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not aim at walls that can be penetrated and shoot using low charge (e.g. the pillars in Gasworks)</li>
<li>Use the Tau only when players are in front of map walls that cannot be penetrated.</li>
<li>Charge up your shots before shooting.</li>
</ol>
<p>As simple as this sounds, it’s much more of a problem playing HLDM where everyone’s moving really fast and one bad shot can get you down 60hp or more, and this mechanic rewards quick thinking.<br>
Certain maps have a higher selfgauss potential than others, Crossfire IIRC does not have many thick walls that aren’t the map walls so it’s harder to selfgauss, but other maps do.<br>
Also, the gauss cannon in vanilla HLDM is broken in the fact that LMB uses up two ammo but deals 20 damage, whereas RMB uses 1 but deals much more (i am assuming 60-80), but then the drawback is high selfgauss potential as the charge is very low. This isn’t present in BMDM as each shot requires 3 ammo to use before firing, which is a good change to make.</p>
<p>However, I have not seen AG’s take on the Gauss, perhaps it’s much better than the HLDM version.</p>

            <p>I think we all can agree that in the moment the Gauss is a too powerful Weapon, because its easyness of the Hitbox problem. We will see how the next update fixes the Weapon behavior.<br>
No doubts is that the Multiplayerservers are so empty because new Players get frustrated when good players rape everything with only using the Gauss.</p>
<p>You cant really compare HL1 with BM because its different Engines, the whole feeling is different and the Playerdimensions too, a problem the CS Community had back then too.</p>
<p>We will see what future Updates bring to us, i hope some wishes of the community will be heard.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Yes Tau currently is the strongest weapon. But it’s completely different to HL and AG because</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s almost impossible to move unpredictable and dodge enemies shots because of slow ground acceleration</li>
<li>In current BM Tau shots register on your enemies bounding box (a lot bigger space than the actual playermodel hitboxes). This is a bug wich will be fixed in next BM update. So it will be harder to hit Tau shots.</li>
<li>Atm a charged Tau cannon is silent in almost all situations. I think this doesn’t work as intended, because 3D sound generally doesn’t work well in BM. Silent walk is useless in BM because it’s almost impossible to hear footsteps anyway. It should be worked on this (make footsteps and charged tau louder).</li>
<li>Normally the other weapons like Mp5, Shotgun and Crossbow are very good counters to Tau Cannon if used in the right situation. The problem is that BM’s weapons are less effective to use compared to the way they work in HL1DM and AG: The shotgun has a huge post-shot reloadtime (very low rate of fire) and accuracy of both primary and secondary shot seem lower (maybe it’s just that hit feedback could be better). MP5 has 5 more shots in HLDM and no screenmovement while spraying. This makes it a lot easier to trace your enemy and deal damage constantly while he moves through the air (overall DPS seems to be higher in BM but to me it feels like i’m missing most of the important shots because of  the annoying screen movement). In HLDM the crossbow is used to set up ambushes, staying away from your enemy and dealing damage. The tracer effect in BM makes it impossible to keep your enemy unaware while shooting him. You see… All other weapons are nerfed in a way which make Tau cannon less counterable.</li>
<li>In HL1 Crossfire is a very very agressive and dynamic map. A lot of Weapons are spread around the map but Tau Cannon is the most effective (besides Egon, which is overpowered in vanilla HL1DM, anyway) because it’s hitscan, it allows you to use a positional advantage against your enemy and wallbang him and it allows you to move around the map quickly and dodge. That said it’s obvious that Crossfire is a very Tau heavy map.</li>
</ol>

But really I think the best way would be to make all weapons, ammolimits and multiplayer gameplay mechanics just exactly like in Adrenaline Gamer, since that game currently still has the biggst competetive Half-Life Multiplayer community of all Half-Life games… It works, it’s fun, it’s perfectly fast, skillfull and balanced. Anyway I’m excited to see any Updates concerning Multiplayer gameplay after Xen is released. I really hope the Devs will continue working on MP…</p>

<p>Tau absolutely should not the most powerful weapon, it makes gameplay boring and all weapons useless. The only skill tau takes is doing chain jumps. But unlike rocket jumps like in TF2, you only waste a miserable amount of ammo doing so, your health is fine. Tau is already:</p>
<ol>
<li>Best close quarters weapon</li>
<li>Best long range weapon</li>
<li>Hitscan, you can’t dodge it</li>
<li>Tau jumps which are extremely easy to pull off</li>
<li>Very forgiving weapon</li>
<li>Has knockback</li>
<li>Has wall penetration<br>
8 ) Absolutely no danger to the user unless you’re dumb enough to hold RMB for 5 seconds</li>
<li>(bug) The charging sound gets muted so there’s no way to know someone is coming for you with a full charged tau (which takes like 1 second…)</li>
<li>Allows you to levitate and rain down Tau on everyone</li>
</ol>
<p>RPG is a powerful weapon but it’s easy to dodge rockets with long jump module, it’s extremely dangerous to the user because a fart to the general direction of the rocket will explode it and the guy firing it. The rockets are also buggy so in no way reliable.<br>
Crossbow punishes you with an extremely long reload and you can kill yourself with explosives.<br>
Shotgun is simply too random and has long reload.<br>
MP5 has recoil and the nades are its only saving grace.</p>
<p>Fight for what? You have 2xTau on Crossfire, with unlimited ammo spread out on the entire map. Most of the time you just spawn right next to it.</p>
<p>Highlevel gameplay without Tau is fun and challenging. When we gather up we make truce not to use Tau. As for selfgauss, take a look at this video and count the times this happened: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AUUFhIaEGg" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=1AUUFhIaEGg</a></p>

<p>No, it’s different. Just now I had a rocket do a 180 when a guy spawned right infront of me with a pistol. I simply jumped and fired with laser guidance off while he shot me too. Luckily, this time I survived, and he didn’t.</p>

<p>Anything would do at this point. I know I typed “gauss is fine” before, but I changed my mind. Right now it’s the most no-skill weapon in game. Click in general direction and there goes 100 hp/100ap. lol</p>

</aside>
<p>if it’s there, perhaps raise the chances because then it will be more of a punishing weapon to use; make it more of a marksman’s weapon that rewards precise shots and punishes people who aren’t that good yet, and then the crossbow becomes somewhat useful<br>
with the hitreg change for the tau this could result in it being used effectively by very few</p>
