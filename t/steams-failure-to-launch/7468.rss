    <title>Steam&#39;s failure to launch.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steams-failure-to-launch/7468</link>
    <description>As the title states, steam will not launch. I recently updated my system to 64 bit. I&#39;ve never had such a problem in 32-bit, in my settings I have made it so that steam will launch when my pc starts. However, If I exit steam I am not able to launch it, there lies my problem. Any help would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>So as to not waste time with a new topic, I’m going to post my new problem here. I installed a new service pack for Windows 7 and now when I try to run steam as administrator I get this message: “The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion”. Can anyone help me with this, because it has become very bothersome to have to deal with a problem when I just want the damned thing to run.</p>
<p>EDIT: After simply restarting my PC my problem is solved, neglect this post.</p>

            <p>In the future, if this happens again just delete everything but “steam.exe” and the SteamApps folder in the Steam directory, and run Steam.exe as an administrator. Your games will remain intact and it will redownload Steam.</p>

            <p>Well, when I updated to 64 bit I reinstalled steam, are you suggesting that I reinstall it again?</p>

            <p>“Updated to 64 bit?”</p>
<p>Did you try reinstalling Steam? You don’t have to delete your games, but try reinstalling the client.</p>

            <p>Try running it as an administrator, some programs (for me) only open if I do it that way.</p>
