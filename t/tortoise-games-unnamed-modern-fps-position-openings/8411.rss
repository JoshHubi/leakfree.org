Hey everyone, I&#39;ve been a long time member, but a very infrequent poster here. I just wanted to share with you an itch that I&#39;ve been scratching for quite some time now. With the past few years of PC Gaming bringing about a lower quality, higher priced form of FPS, I&#39;ve come to the realization that the FPS I keep telling myself will appear, will never come to fruition. I&#39;ve been in the competitive FPS arena since 1997 with a passion for tactical, military shooters that provide accessibility (SWAT 4 is a great example). I&#39;m seeking to found a team of talented, committed artists, modelers, sound engineers etc. who share a common joy from online competitive play, teamwork, and community driven gaming experience. If anyone here is even REMOTELY interested in my idea (for work or information/input) PLEASE reply to my post, I would love feedback!

About Tortoise Games

______________________________________________________________________________________

The individuals currently working within Tortoise Games were consumers of the very products they now strive to develop. The studio in and of itself was founded under the guide of producing a quality, gaming entertainment experience that rivals consumer’s growing expectations within the market. With the current trend of poorly delivered, under-realized “AAA” titles hitting the beloved PC platform for their console-oriented conception, consumers have been slowly facing poor outlooks on their PC-oriented purchases. With a steady rise in prices, and a drop in overall product quality, we here at Tortoise are driving to deliver a “return to form”.

The “Tactical Shooter” has been MIA for many years, with many reliable IPs forgetting the safety at home; a gap has started to appear amongst shooter fans. What was once used as a keystone to competitive gaming and revolutionary game design, has now become the industry standard of a stead-fast cash-in. What once was about, team, tactics, planning, and execution, has now become rapid skirmishes between two to three “star” players on a team. Although this method of FPS gaming is fun (even for us tactical guys) the utter lack of substitute for pace, and play style has driven Tortoise Games to lead the production of an AAA, multiplayer, Tactical FPS (First Person Shooter).

The yet-to-be named title, currently in development with the help of CryEngine 3, will be the most engrossing multiplayer experience to date. Instituting a high-level of integrated action-to-animation systems (your soldier will open a door by outreaching his hand etc.), deeply researched and realistically designed environments, and exceedingly integrated team play (although playing alone and without being integrated with the rest of your team will be possible, ultimate success will be unlikely), Tortoise Games hopes to bring back the competitive FPS to its former glory.

After two years of in-depth research concerning player behavior, we have discovered that most players yield a more enjoyable experience accomplishing a task, goal, or otherwise together, than by one’s self. As such, the key design behind the yet-to-be named title will center on the importance of team (to a realistic degree). Mechanics such as squad moral, amount of suppression, locations of squad mates, etc. will be implemented by design. We are hard at work trying to deliver the most authentic, immersive, squad-based combat game ever.

We planning on delivering this yet-to-be named title to consumers exclusively digitally and plan on updating the title, post-launch, with free content updates (maps, modes, weapons, squad roles, etc.)

If you would like to ask us a question, provide us with constructive feedback, or join the team, feel free to reply to this post!

Personal Experience

______________________________________________________________________________________

Some quick information about myself, I was the 3D Animation and Graphics design team lead on my high school U.S FIRST Robotics team for four years, where I worked with college students from The Ohio State University every Saturday for about sixth months a year. They taught me the detailing behind an animation project and the inner-workings of Autodesk&#39;s 3DS Max.

As the team lead, I was given a team of 20 individuals, tasked with brainstorming and delivering a high fidelity animation segment by the end of the season. These 20 individuals assigned to me had varying experience in the 3D world which presented challenges for me in instruction and execution. In addition to my experience as a team lead, I&#39;ve also built maps (starting in 2006) using the Quake 3 engine, Source engine, and Cryengine platforms.

I&#39;ve had experience on several Battlefield 2 mod teams including Rising Conflict and Project Reality. I&#39;m currently a fifth year senior at The Ohio State University, where I am studying (very heavily) to become fluent in the field of Marketing and Promotional advertising.

(Updates 1-4 can be seen by clicking the link given below to the Crydev Forum)


UPDATE 5:

Please keep in mind that my textures (as well as Crytek&#39;s vegetation and sounds) are currently placeholders and will be updated throughout the life of the project. I&#39;m trying to get things into a playable setting before worrying about the any significant texture work is done.While the walkthrough video may not seem like much, I challenge you to compare the modeled version of Sant Elm, Spain to the real one via Google Earth.

Comments and feedback are always appreciated!

I am apart of the team currently developing the game. I am a 3D-modeler, although I mostly work on larger scale items, such as buildings etc. We are currently seeking:

Texture Artists
Vegetation Artists
Concept Artists
3D Modelers
Sound Designer

This is going to be a stand-alone game, and it is in its VERY early stages of development, so a very dedicated team would be desired. I know there is a lot of talented people in this forum, hence me posting here. If you are interested, or want to discuss anything about the game with my team and I, feel free to pm or reply. We have a teamspeak server, so if you have a mic, pm for info to that. We are taking suggestions, so if you have a serious one, let me know.

Thanks,
Khaos124, and the rest of Tortoise Games.</description>

            <p>What GangXtaZz^ said! :retard:</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
I have some ideas if you’re interested… First off.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>but we’re also going to try to branch out and grab in consumers like yourself, we just aren’t exactly sure how to do that yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you want some casual gamers to play your game then put in a gamemode like team deathmatch or free for all. That way the people who aren’t interested in tactics can just run and gun.</p>
<p>And also…<br>
I had an idea for a new gamemode. (I don’t really know if it really is new but I haven’t seen a game with this gamemode yet so…) It’s like squad deathmatch in battlefield 3 but instead of winning by reaching the target score you win by having the highest average kill death ratio of all the members in your squad.</p>
<p>Pros.</p>
<ul>
<li>People will not just focus on killing but also on survival which ‘‘might’’ give a new tactical way of playing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because you meet different enemy squads then there’s a probably a bigger chance that you will get attacked from different sides more often. Because if enemy squad 1 comes at you from the front then there’s probably no chance that enemy squad 2 will come from the same direction, because if the two of them met each other at the front before coming at you then one of the teams should have probably killed the other already.<br>
Which means that if you encounter multiple enemy squads at the same time then it’s probably from different directions. And because of the survival aspect this will lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>That they will plan there attack routes more wisely so that they can’t be attacked from different directions at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It might become to messy.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the pros and cons that I could think of right now but I bet that there are more.<br>
And remember that these are just my idea’s! I have no way of knowing and proving that these idea’s are good. Though I hope that they are.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think you guys understand (or really know, I’m not sure if I’ve clarified) what were going for with this game. We’re really trying to appeal to the old school fps player, the SWAT 4 lover, really emphasizing the <span class="bbcode-u">TACTICAL</span> part of a Tactical FPS. We are striving to make a game that feels as tactically involved as a game like SWAT 4 (although with a different premise on game play.) We at Tortoise Games have also grown very tired of the modern “run-n-gun” “point-and-click” shooter. We’re trying to bring a game to the market that we feel the Old-school FPS consumer has been looking for for years now.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Careful with that, in my experience games that try to meld experiences just end up with the worst of both worlds not the best.</p>

            <p>I like the level design, can’t wait to see what it looks like without the placeholder textures.  Unfortunately, I won’t ever play it because, while I am a huge fan of old school FPS games, I don’t play tactical shooters.  I’m not patient enough, nor good enough at the tactics, to be any good at them.  If this were more like Doom (which is what it sounds like you’re trying to avoid) I’d give it a shot.</p>

<p>I think shooters need to try and get more realistic reactions to getting shot, sort of like Rockstar’s use of Euphoria. It’s really not that satisfying to shoot people in most games now, where they just stand there getting shot until they die, at which point they turn into a ragdoll. That and better AI. If those things are improved it could lead to much better tactical shooting.</p>

<p>I don’t think you guys understand (or really know, I’m not sure if I’ve clarified) what were going for with this game. We’re really trying to appeal to the old school fps player, the SWAT 4 lover, really emphasizing the <span class="bbcode-u">TACTICAL</span> part of a Tactical FPS. We are striving to make a game that feels as tactically involved as a game like SWAT 4 (although with a different premise on game play.) We at Tortoise Games have also grown very tired of the modern “run-n-gun” “point-and-click” shooter. We’re trying to bring a game to the market that we feel the Old-school FPS consumer has been looking for for years now.</p>

            <p>I agree, but I meant more along the lines of the actual game mechanics. I’m all for more realistic hit reactions and impact effects on people like Rockstar is doing with MP3</p>

            <p>Nice looking stuff, but I kinda agree with xalener on this</p>
<p>I’m not really quite a fan of tactical shooters anymore, it just seems such a waste to have such realistic mechanics where the ultimate goal of the game is to kill things.</p>
<p>I still like tactical games like thief, however, or things where the emphasis is on something other then shooting</p>

            <p>Oh wow. That’s a huge level in your map video there. Can’t wait to see final textures.</p>
<p>That said, I’d like to see a similarly ultra-clean look to the buildings. Light beige/white textures always manage to make blood stand out, making tracking bleeding opponents easier. (Depending on whether there is a bleed system, or whether the combat will even allow for wounds. Is it one shot kills a la Rainbow Six/ Rogue Spear?)</p>

I know I haven’t been posting at all in this thread, and this has been kind of in the dark, but everything has been under “lock-and-key” so to speak up to this point, and now we have quite a few new screenshots and a video to show to all that are interested.<br>

<p>The video I mentioned earlier:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXV40pMC1ug" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXV40pMC1ug</a></p>
<p>As you can see, were lacking in the texture department, 90% of the textures in that video are placeholders. We’d love any interested individuals to come aboard. I’m still open to any questions, and PMing me is always welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Khaos124 and the rest of Tortoise Games.</p>

            <p>I don’t know if I can help much, maybe with some art and Ideas I guess, but here’s some of my best, but not my latest and greatest. I haven’t gotten around to learning photoshop well enough to color it.</p>

<p>Also, I know that it’s not FPS or Military-like, but I am working on one of those now and so far it looks good, but I am not the kind of guy to upload unfinished pics.</p>

            <p>Sorry about the late response, but anywho, I am now willing to answer some questions for you guys. Without deeplinking. So ask away, but dont expect anything with major detail. Also, if anyone here has any talent at all when it comes to web design, we have another paying position open on that front as well!</p>
