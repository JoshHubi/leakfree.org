    <title>Battlefield 3 Tournament</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/battlefield-3-tournament/7907</link>
    <description>So EA announced that they are holding a Battlefield 3 Tournament in early 2012, with a 1.6 million dollar price. The tournament is going to be held online, so anyone can anticipate. But the problem is that this will be [u]only for Xbox360 and Playstation 3.[/u]

I mean, what is EA thinking? For me, it seems like they are moving away from the PC fans. I was so excited by the way that DICE tried to show that they supported PC that much, so this is such a letdown. They are starting to look more and more like Activision.

So let&#39;s all contact EA at the same time, saying that THIS IS WRONG  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

<p>I pretty much figured out their support for the PC was a sham once they said modders were too dumb to figure out how to use their tools.</p>

            <p>EA seems to think nobody plays the PC anymore so they’re trying to scare PC gamers into buying the console version. EA games as a whole hasn’t impressed me since 2005 -_-</p>

            <p>EA’s way of making decisions:</p>
<p>Good ideas cost money. Bad ideas cost reputation.</p>
<p>Money &gt; Reputation.</p>
<p>Pick worst idea. Make most money.</p>

            <p>It’s either 360 and PS3, or just PC. Can you imagine hardcore pc gamers with keyboard and mouse facing console players? It’d be a bloodbath. Plus, with the game being really young then, chances of hacks being used are greater on PC than consoles.</p>
<p>Instead of choosing PC and alienating console owners, which makes zero sense financially, they chose console owners. Can’t blame them.</p>
