    <title>Windows 7 IP Address Resolution</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-7-ip-address-resolution/5274</link>
    <description>Hello all,

I have a question regarding how and where Windows 7 stores the relationship between IP addresses and NetBIOS names.  

Situation - I have a Windows Home Server that used to have an internal IP of 192.168.1.6.  I would RDP into the Server using it&#39;s NetBIOS name (i.e. MyServer).  

However, I have since updated the way my router&#39;s DHCP issues IP addresses, and my server now has an IP address of 192.168.1.55.  If I try to RDP to the NetBIOS name (MyServer) the RDP times out, but it&#39;s fine if I RDP to the IP address.  Likewise, if I try to ping MyServer, MY computer&#39;s IP address (192.168.1.52) responds, saying the destination (192.168.1.6) is unreachable.  Yet, if I do a ping -A 192.168.1.55, &quot;MyServer.home&quot; responds.  And if I run nbtstat -A 192.168.1.55, MyServer responds as well.  

Can I reset the IP-to-NetBIOS cache?  I tried to Google such a thing, but most of the results have to do with flushing the DNS cache, or mundane things like manually configuring an IP address.  

I&#39;d appreciate any helpful tips  :smiley: 

Edit: 2 seconds after posting this, I found [url=&#39;https://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5034239.html&#39;]this article[/url], which may help - I&#39;ll report back if not, and/or to check on other people&#39;s advice  :slight_smile: 

Edit #2: Yup, skimmed article, tried nbtstat -R, restarted, no dice.  Still open to advice  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/sersoft">@Sersoft</a>, it’s not really specific to Windows Home Server.  The issue is with Windows 7, or, I suppose, with Windows in general.  I did try flushing the DNS cache, as well as the nbtstat cache - still no luck.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Mango</span> - that’s a drawing?  Holy cripes, well done to your friend haha.</p>

            <p>Yeah.  I agree.  Waaaayyy too many hoops to jump through (7 layers, multiple protocols, loads of hardware, WINS, DNS, DHCP, firewalls, etc.) on a network designed by the US military in the 1960s, currently supporting x-million devices.  What a nightmare.</p>
<p>Sooo… any ideas?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Nice avatar by the way - can’t wait for Crysis 2 to come out.</p>
