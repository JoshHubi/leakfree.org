    <title>Unplayable framerate in c2a3c</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unplayable-framerate-in-c2a3c/10873</link>
    <description>In the open area with the fassassins after they kill the security guard, the framerate drops massively, from 140+ to around 10. It started after I loaded a quicksave in this area, and now it&#39;s totally unplayable. Help?


EDIT: It seems that backtracking to the point that the previous level loads and then going back has fixed it.</description>

            <p>For me that part worked fine, but later I loaded a saved game to retry it in hard mode and had the awful framerate. Similarly the final battle in Lambda Core, it was OK until I died, and then when I reloaded the saved game it had an awful framerate. I was able to fix the Lambda Core one simply by quitting the game, going back into it again and loading, but that didn’t work for the assassin bit. I’ll bare in mind the backtrack-to-previous-area method and the wait-around-for-a-few-minutes method.</p>

<p>Ah good to hear it’s not just me. The frame rate gets specifically bad in the upper control room looking at the Apache. It returns to the normal VSync’d 120 FPS if I move far away enough from it. Unfortunately the drop occurs at the critical point, when the assassins are trying to rape you…<br>

            <p>Known bug. Either backtrack to a previous area and then return back (as you had done accordingly to your edit) or simply stay in that area doing nothing for several minutes and lags would go away.</p>
