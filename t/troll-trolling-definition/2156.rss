    <title>Troll / Trolling - Definition</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/troll-trolling-definition/2156</link>
    <description>It would seem that some of our forumites need a refresher course on the meaning of the word &quot;Troll&quot;.  I am not going to reference anyone in particular, (pointedly looks around at some of the forumites) but some folks are starting to look like baboons due to the continued improper use of the word.  I am not a grammar nazi, english police, or spelling warlord by any means.  I just think it is important to remember what the real definition of a troll is.

Here goes:
[quote]
straightdope.com - What is a troll?

&quot;Troll,&quot; in the context of message boards and the like, describes somebody who is posting [u]just to be confrontational or to raise hackles[/u]. One example might be a teenager who finds Black Mesa message board and posts, &quot;Is Adrain Shepperd going to be in Black Mesa?&quot; or &quot;Is the dev team gonna remake Blue Shift or Opposing Force?&quot; The teen may not know or care one way or the other--he just wants a reaction. He wants to piss people off. He is a troll.
[/quote]

[quote]
 Judith Donath (1999)

A troll disrupts the discussion on a newsgroup, disseminate bad advice, and damage the feeling of trust in the newsgroup community. [COLOR=&#39;Plum&#39;](CatzEyes93: This means their sole purpose is to disrupt)

Furthermore, in a group that has become sensitized to trolling — where the rate of deception is high — many honestly naïve questions may be quickly rejected as trollings.  [COLOR=&#39;Plum&#39;](CatzEyes93: This means others may jump up and call TROLL when in fact it is NOT a troll.)

This can be quite off-putting to the new user who upon venturing a first posting is immediately bombarded with angry accusations. Even if the accusation is unfounded, being branded a troll is quite damaging to one&#39;s online reputation.
[/quote]

[quote]
Wiki Troll_(Internet) / Usage

Often, calling someone a troll makes assumptions about a writer&#39;s motives. Regardless of the circumstances, controversial posts may attract a particularly strong response from those unfamiliar with the robust dialogue found in some online, rather than physical, communities. 

Experienced participants in online forums know that the most effective way to discourage a troll is usually to ignore him or her, because responding tends to encourage trolls to continue disruptive posts — hence the often-seen warning: &quot;Please do not feed the trolls&quot;.

flayme.com - Why do trolls do it?

I believe that most trolls are sad people, living their lonely lives vicariously through those they see as strong and successful.  [COLOR=&#39;Plum&#39;](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)

Disrupting a stable newsgroup gives the illusion of power, just as for a few, stalking a strong person allows them to think they are strong, too.[COLOR=&#39;Plum&#39;](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)

For trolls, any response is &#39;recognition&#39;; they are unable to distinguish between irritation and admiration; their ego grows directly in proportion to the response, regardless of the form or content of that response.[COLOR=&#39;Plum&#39;](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)

Trolls, rather surprisingly, dispute this, claiming that it&#39;s a game or joke; this merely confirms the diagnosis; how sad do you have to be to find such mind-numbingly trivial timewasting to be funny?[COLOR=&#39;Plum&#39;](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)

Remember that trolls are cowards; they&#39;ll usually post just enough to get an argument going, then sit back and count the responses (Yes, that&#39;s what they do!).[COLOR=&#39;Plum&#39;](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)

<p>A very basic rule to tell the difference between a troll and someone who’s simply really bad at stating an opinion.</p>
<p>If you agree with what you’re saying, YOU’RE NOT TROLLING.<br>

            <p>I think this definition is a bit off. Here is a good alternative explanation for you to read, Catz: <a href="https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1764/what-is-a-troll" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1764/what-is-a-troll</a></p>
<p>Trolling is a method of fishing where you trail bait through the water from a slow-moving boat hoping to hook an unwary fish. An online troll does much the same.</p>
<p>“Troll,” in the context of message boards and the like, describes somebody who is posting just to be confrontational or to raise hackles.  Trolling aims to elicit an emotional reaction from those with a hair-trigger on the reply key.</p>

        <title>Troll / Trolling - Definition</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[CatzEyes93]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It would seem that some of our forumites need a refresher course on the meaning of the word “Troll”.  I am not going to reference anyone in particular, (pointedly looks around at some of the forumites) but some folks are starting to look like baboons due to the continued improper use of the word.  I am not a grammar nazi, english police, or spelling warlord by any means.  I just think it is important to remember what the real definition of a troll is.</p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://straightdope.com">straightdope.com</a> - What is a troll?</p>
<p>“Troll,” in the context of message boards and the like, describes somebody who is posting <span class="bbcode-u">just to be confrontational or to raise hackles</span>. One example might be a teenager who finds Black Mesa message board and posts, “Is Adrain Shepperd going to be in Black Mesa?” or “Is the dev team gonna remake Blue Shift or Opposing Force?” The teen may not know or care one way or the other–he just wants a reaction. He wants to piss people off. He is a troll.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Judith Donath (1999)</p>
<p>A troll disrupts the discussion on a newsgroup, disseminate bad advice, and damage the feeling of trust in the newsgroup community. [COLOR=‘Plum’](CatzEyes93: This means their sole purpose is to disrupt)</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a group that has become sensitized to trolling — where the rate of deception is high — many honestly naïve questions may be quickly rejected as trollings.  [COLOR=‘Plum’](CatzEyes93: This means others may jump up and call TROLL when in fact it is NOT a troll.)</p>
<p>This can be quite off-putting to the new user who upon venturing a first posting is immediately bombarded with angry accusations. Even if the accusation is unfounded, being branded a troll is quite damaging to one’s online reputation.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Wiki Troll_(Internet) / Usage</p>
<p>Often, calling someone a troll makes assumptions about a writer’s motives. Regardless of the circumstances, controversial posts may attract a particularly strong response from those unfamiliar with the robust dialogue found in some online, rather than physical, communities.</p>
<p>Experienced participants in online forums know that the most effective way to discourage a troll is usually to ignore him or her, because responding tends to encourage trolls to continue disruptive posts — hence the often-seen warning: “Please do not feed the trolls”.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://flayme.com">flayme.com</a> - Why do trolls do it?</p>
<p>I believe that most trolls are sad people, living their lonely lives vicariously through those they see as strong and successful.  [COLOR=‘Plum’](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)</p>
<p>Disrupting a stable newsgroup gives the illusion of power, just as for a few, stalking a strong person allows them to think they are strong, too.[COLOR=‘Plum’](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)</p>
<p>For trolls, any response is ‘recognition’; they are unable to distinguish between irritation and admiration; their ego grows directly in proportion to the response, regardless of the form or content of that response.[COLOR=‘Plum’](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)</p>
<p>Trolls, rather surprisingly, dispute this, claiming that it’s a game or joke; this merely confirms the diagnosis; how sad do you have to be to find such mind-numbingly trivial timewasting to be funny?[COLOR=‘Plum’](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)</p>
<p>Remember that trolls are cowards; they’ll usually post just enough to get an argument going, then sit back and count the responses (Yes, that’s what they do!).[COLOR=‘Plum’](CatzEyes93: This means a troll wishes he were you)</p>

<p>oh, and to use another “term” that I can’t stand</p>
