    <description>Now, I know that the RAM is compatible with my motherboard but I&#39;m starting to think that [url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231230&#39;]this[/url] RAM doesn&#39;t work with i5 chips. Anyone know for sure? I&#39;m guessing that I&#39;m right and have to buy different RAM :fffuuu: .</description>

            <p>Yes it is. Oh and you could use the tri-channel stuff in your i5 setup but if you plugged into three slots the ram would only run in single channel mode which would slow the PC down so it’s a waste of money.</p>
<p>8gb is a waste at the moment unless you are using some really memory hungry apps. 4gb should be more than adequate for most uses. You don’t need to spend that much on ram either, you could probably pick up some good stuff with better timings about 30% cheaper.</p>

            <p>Not compatible. It’s RAM for i7, so just get a different set of RAM. A lot of the comments about it were negative anyways.</p>
