<p>Yeah, according to the site the NS2 is powered by a hydrogen cell, kinetic movement, solar, (possibly thermal, cant remember) and dead things. :fffuuu:</p>

<p>Agreed, it’s a fuutuuure game, it doesn’t matter if stuff gets clogged in there, it probably cleans itself and who cares if it’s heavy? It’s probably powered too considering it has strength mode.</p>

<p>The point is the suit movement is self powered, the human inside’s own muscle counts for relatively little.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My point is, because of the size and material of the suit, it doesn’t matter how well powered it is, it’s too top-heavy, too large to be useful in cover, the poor guy can’t even bend his feet properly, and from the looks of it, his greatest challenge wouldn’t be the enemy, it’d be bending over to pick something up.  Even if he’s a frontline unit, he still needs to be able to move well.  A well placed RPG round would take him out.</p>
<p>He looks far more awesome than the Nano suit, don’t get me wrong.  But practical he ain’t.</p>

<p>If it’s not skin tight, it won’t be maneuverable at all.  If you’re going for a massive tank-like guy who’s slow as shit but strong as hell sure.

<p>I disagree. It’s not impractical to have a ‘tank-like’ suit of armor and not be maneuverable / effective. For example, take Tychus Findlay’s armor:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
And then look at the nano suit (this is N1, but it’s the same idea):<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
The above image shows a much heavier armored marine, yet the suit is certainly flexible and maneuverable due to the fact that it is all powered and requires very little human effort to move it. Although, I will admit that there are exposed hoses on the heavier armor, it just seems like it would stand up to a lot more than the nanosuit.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s just more badass.</p>

<p>Everyone seems think in extremes. If it’s not skin tight, it has to be a tank. Body armor can have nearly full body coverage without impeding mobility dramatically, being catsuits or being hulking masses of armor with a compartment for bodies. Moderation is usually the most practical.<br>
Then why isn’t modern, real body armor made like that?</p>
<p>EDIT: Wait a minute, why isn’t this merged with the game trailers thread?</p>

<p>We’re talking about something that enhances a person’s abilities, not only protecting them from bullets.  Kevlar does, in fact, impede a person’s abilities. It’s not light.  Not at all.<br>
Wearing a complete suit of kevlar would be impossible to maneuver in.<br>
Anything rigid that covers the body would limit that person’s ability to move.  That’s simple fact.<br>
So realistically a suit that makes a person more maneuverable would have to be very pliable.<br>
In this case it’s sheer genius, as the suit is made of man-made ‘muscles’ that can increase the wearers strength and speed, and protect against harm.</p>

            <p>They look skin tight, and I doubt they’re size adjustable, so they’d have to be tailor made.<br>
The real criticism is that it looks like a outside of they body. Filled with several little creases, that I assume are for movement, would probably be easily clogged. Not to mention being on the outside the armor, they’d be more vulnerable and would be better off covered.</p>
<p>(I also think that it makes it look kinda ugly, and the helmet looks rather bland, but that’s something else entirely.)</p>

            <p>It was more of a teaser really. Just building hype for the game. Which, I think, it has done quite well.<br>
Impractical? How so?</p>

            <p>Wow, a trailer that neither shows or tells you anything about the game! I’m impressed. :meh:</p>
<p>It’s funny how they designed that suit to not look like any of the cliche hulking masses of metal that you see in most FPS’, yet they managed to make a suit that looks even more impractical.</p>
