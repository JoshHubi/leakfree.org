            <p>I’ve yet to meet a mod with an orchestral OST, no matter how short of an excerpt… Plus, <span class="bbcode-i">From South Carolina</span>’s sample seems to have a substantially higher quality than the WAVs which were earlier included with Sweet Half-Life.</p>
<p>Sweet Half-Life was made by a Japanese modder, and Her Space Holiday made a song named <span class="bbcode-i">Japanese Gum</span>. It is possible that the source is from a Japanese composer.</p>
