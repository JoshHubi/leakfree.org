    <title>Graphical lag issue at end of game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/graphical-lag-issue-at-end-of-game/10396</link>
    <description>Hello, and congratulations on the mod by the way, it is quite superb.

I had some trouble in the final area, where the scientist dudes set up the portal to Xen.  If I do the whole thing in one go, it&#39;s fine.  However, due to the difficulty of 10 flying fireball throwing bastards combined with lightning zappy guys, I end up having to use quicksaves a couple of times.  When loading a quicksave that has been created [i]during[/i] the portal sequence (when the creatures are teleporting in), I experience extreme graphical lag.  It&#39;s almost unplayable.  My rig is pretty powerful, so it&#39;s not that.</description>

            <p>I have this exact problem. It’s so bad that I can’t finish the game. I’ve updated my graphics drivers, and tried running on the lowest settings, with no improvement. As long as the center of the room (where the portal is trying to open) is not in view, then it runs smoothly.</p>

            <p>I’ve had extremely bad FPS in that final scene as well. I played the whole game with maxed out settings on everything and v-sync on with a constant 60 FPS except for a few areas where it sometimes dropped to say 30 FPS. Even though not state-of-the-art, my Radeon HD 5800 should handle it pretty easily at 1680x1050, which it has for most of the game.</p>
<p>The only part where it was downright unplayable was the last scene where you wait for the Xen portal to be ready. The FPS there dropped to 5-10 FPS at most. I couldn’t aim to save my life. I had to go down the ladder and hide from everything until the portal was ready and I could simply make a run for it. It happened from the very moment the portal was fired up, and for me wasn’t affected by quicksave/load.</p>
<p>I thought I may be hitting a GPU limit. I eventually got to the point where every single graphics setting was on the lowest options (I didn’t even know “Bilinear” still existed for heaven’s sake!). But alas, the FPS did not improve one bit. It might have been a CPU-bound limitation, but my quad core Q9450 should be able to handle it.</p>
<p>Otherwise a fantastic mod. Keep up the good work!</p>
<p>EDIT: I just loaded the autosave from the start of that scene and it played okay. Weird.</p>
