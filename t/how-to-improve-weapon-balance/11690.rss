<p>I just want the pellet spread widened a bit. The shotgun should not have the range it does, nor should you miss point blank shots because the spread is so tight it goes straight past the target.</p>
<p>Same with the assault rifle. The accuracy cone needs to widen faster on sustained fire to force players to practice better trigger discipline in order to hit. Right now you can get a fairly tight spread on that one too. Guns were actually much less accurate in the original and that was one of the reasons it was so challenging.</p>

<p>Seriously? You want them to nerf the range on the SPAS-12 shotgun just to fix point-blank usage? That wouldn’t be very realistic. Besides, the point blank shots missing is probably more a glitch than related to the spread (seeing as a point-blank shot with that tight a spread would hit the target in real life). Contrary to popular belief, shotguns have what could legitimately be called a “respectable range”. My dad uses 1 for hunting, so he should know. Here is the real-world range of a SPAS-12, given in meters, feet, yards, &amp; hammer units (using the “1 hammer unit=1/16 of a foot” premise):</p>
<ul>
<li>40.2336 meters</li>
<li>44 yards</li>
<li>132 feet</li>
<li>2,112 hammer units</li>
</ul>

<p>I think there should be an option to set the SPAS-12’s secondary fire to either “fire both barrels” or “fire semiautomatic” (the former for authenticity to <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 1</span>, the latter for players who want it to function realistically).</p>

            <p>Either stronger shotgun or weaker zombies, a zombie should not be alive after a point blank double shotgun blast.</p>
<p>P.S. I know I can change the values myself, but I wanted to bring this to the attention of devs.</p>
