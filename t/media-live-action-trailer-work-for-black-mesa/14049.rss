    <title>Media/Live-Action/Trailer Work for Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/media-live-action-trailer-work-for-black-mesa/14049</link>
    <description>Hey everyone

My name is Gage, and I am a film writer, director, producer, editor, and VFX Artist. I create game trailers, official live-action game promos, and movies. I run Lotims Inc., a multi-media company that  makes award winning short films, official video game trailers, and officially licensed live-action video game promos/films.

I have been doing substantial work for a lot of mods lately in the trailer/media department, amongst them are [url=&#39;https://www.falloutlonestar.com&#39;]Fallout: Lonestar[/url], [url=&#39;https://www.falloutthefrontier.com&#39;]Fallout: The Frontier[/url], and [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adrcJpyGUJk&#39;]Fallout: Dust[/url]. As well as working with indie game developers from around the world, including creating the official trailers for [url=&#39;https://www.scpcbgame.com&#39;]SCP: Containment Breach[/url].

I&#39;ve been playing Black Mesa for a while now, and wanted to inquire and offer my abilities to the Black Mesa team for any media related projects!

My work: [url=&#39;https://www.gageallen.com/&#39;]www.gageallen.com[/url]
My Reel: [url]https://vimeo.com/122935344[/url]
My Company work: [url=&#39;https://www.lotims.net/&#39;]www.lotims.net[/url]

Some of the trailers I&#39;ve done:
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpmE5Wy7YMU&#39;]SCP: Containment Breach Trailer 1[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYXzA_UQpp0&#39;]SCP: Containment Breach Trailer 2[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOBNFWgK_2o&#39;]Uncanny Valley 101 Trailer[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adrcJpyGUJk&#39;]Fallout: Dust - Official Trailer[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=801udOUwmKA&#39;]Fallout: Lonestar - Developer Diary 1[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQEKost7bwc&#39;]Containment Breach: Run - Featurette[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibMX0pDjVYI&#39;]Containment Breach: Run - Teaser[/url]

Most of my stuff has become pretty well known, ranging from 100,000 views to over 500,000 views.

I&#39;d love to contribute what I could to the mod team. I&#39;d also love to get the community&#39;s opinion on my stuff too!

Thanks again and keep up the incredible work guys. The game is fantastic</description>
