    <title>My computer just started freezing in windows 7</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-computer-just-started-freezing-in-windows-7/9278</link>
    <description>What the title says, had it with win7 installed for a long time, not many problems with it. Today, after I installed open office (which I doubt is related to it) it froze while I was working on something. No BSOD, no nothing, it just froze and I let it sit for a while then restarted it - and the power was on but the computer wouldn&#39;t turn on, so I shut it off and turned it on again and it loaded up.

Fast forward, while on the internet it froze again, same exact way as above, did a power down for a little bit then turned it on and the computer turned on but nothing was booting again so I restarted and it booted. 

Any ideas on what&#39;s wrong/what I should do?

I have a feeling it&#39;s something to do with my video card, but I have to check it first, since the freezes seem similar to when my old nvidia card used to lock up my computer during certain games.</description>

            <p>I’ve had something similar to this. Tested what I could to no real conclusion and finally put a voltage stabiliser in the loop and the problem went away.<br>
Apparently, low voltage is bad news.</p>

            <p>I had that happening a lot. It happened so often I had to switch systems. I still have no idea what was causing it but I figured it might be my hardware setup.</p>

            <p>Regardless, thanks for the responses guys. So far it hasn’t happened again so I’m hoping it stays that way, but at least if it does I’ll have it narrowed down a bit.</p>

            <p>I noticed that if I accidentally turn my computer off while it’s in sleep mode, it refuses to boot up the next time I turn it on. I’ve only notice the problem with Win7. (I also have OpenOffice 3.2).</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that doesn’t really help, but it’s all I’ve got.</p>

            <p>I’m not quite sure, I have to do some more testing, but after checking event viewer, most of the crashes seemed to happen around the time that we were connecting the new computer to the network for sharing, and my computer even had sharing and network related errors at those times before it crashed.</p>
<p>I’m led even further to believe that it’s not just a coincidence, because so far I’ve been running my computer fine in windows, and I’ve restarted to check, and it hasn’t crashed, and everything I’ve monitored seems to be normal temp-wise. So it could have been an OS-related fluke in conjunction with my network card, which would be weird as fuck.</p>
<p>I’m gonna leave it on and monitor it some more, then try a stress test with some games and see how it goes before doing any physical work on it.</p>

            <p>Turns out it’s not my video card, It locked up in safe mode as well, and I’ve been monitoring it and it’s been fine. Also, this latest boot it hasn’t crashed yet, going on a half-hour, with all the other freezes being within 5-10 minutes of each other.</p>
<p>If it crashes again I suppose I’ll test each RAM stick 1-by-1 to see if any of them are bad.</p>
