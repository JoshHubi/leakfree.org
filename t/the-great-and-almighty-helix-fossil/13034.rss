Twitch Plays Pokemon.

So this is a thing that has been going on for about a week now (and I myself have discovered about a couple days ago). It&#39;s a livestream that involves tens of thousands of people trying to play the same game of Pokemon Red at once.

It&#39;s just as crazy as it sounds.

The stream uses an IRC bot that takes what&#39;s entered into the stream chat and translates them into in-game commands. The bot has two states: &quot;anarchy&quot; is where it accepts all commands, even if there are more than the game can execute, and there is &quot;democracy&quot; where everyone votes on a button-push over a period of twenty seconds.

Already it&#39;s spawned a few memes, such as the aforementioned Helix Fossil, streams of commands and randomness, and this almost irrational fear of the PC, as well as at least a dozen more.

You can see it for yourself here: [url]https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon[/url]
