    <title>Keyboard error or no keyboard present</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/keyboard-error-or-no-keyboard-present/1676</link>
    <description>I unplugged my mouse so I could play a few games on my mom&#39;s laptop. Then I replugged the mouse and booted up my desktop and I got the error in the title during start up. I&#39;m using a logitech g11 keyboard and some chep generic microsoft mouse. I saw online that removing a battery on your motherboard and then putting it back should fix the problem, but doing something like that when I have absolutely no knowledge of its effects makes me nervous. 

So I am wondering, can I accidently further damage computer simply by taking a battery out and putting it back in, and if that doesn&#39;t work, what are my other options?</description>

<p>If you want to unplug your comp’s battery, make sure you unplug the power cable before. Then, just remove the battery by pressing the little things each side of it. Wait about ten seconds, then put it back in.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t do any damage, except for resetting the comp’s clock, if that can be considered damage. Just make just you set the clock right, or you’ll not be able to do updates or log into MSN.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t know if it’ll help you with your keyboard issues but I wish you good luck.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot, fixed the keyboard issue, it also set my computer to boot cdrom first, but that was simple enough to change back.</p>
