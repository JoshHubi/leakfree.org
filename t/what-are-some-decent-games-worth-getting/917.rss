    <description>I&#39;ve recently gotten bored with every video game I own and am looking for something to keep me mindlessly entertained for the rest of summer what are some decent games.

I was thinking of getting Spore finally or maybe Sims 3 but Sims 3 is a bit on the pricey side. what are some other decent games out there worth getting.</description>

            <p>Once again, I say get the Legacy of Kain games. Their story is as good if not better than the Half Life games. The gameplay is great as well.</p>

            <p>Check on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sourceforge</a> for Open-Source projects, as there are plenty of <span class="bbcode-i">very</span> good game projects.</p>
<p>As for FPS games, I’ll recommend <a href="https://www.sauerbraten.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sauerbraten</a>, <a href="https://icculus.org/alienarena/rpa/aquire.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Alien Arena</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.openarena.ws/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">OpenArena</a>.</p>
<p>These are all multi-platform, so if you want to try the mystical thing that is Linux, you can try these on it.</p>
<p>As for commercial games, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky is brilliant.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Seeing as you have Black &amp; White, try Black &amp; White 2; you may like it.<br>
If you like racing games, Colin Mcrae: DiRT is good.<br>
RTS games are try Age of Empires 3 and/or Homeworld 2 and/or Supreme Commander.<br>
For Turn-based strategy, you may want to try Civilization 4 Complete Edition.</p>
<p>I’m not terribly sure on newer games, as my laptop can’t run them well  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Edit <span class="hashtag">#2:</span><br>
If you want to play an MMO, LOTRO is <span class="bbcode-i">supposed</span> to be good.</p>

<p>ah man I miss Mech Warriors I wish I still had that I should look for some torrents or something those games kicked so much ass finally a good suggestion  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>and mercenaries kicked ass anyone know is Mercs 2 if as good? (I only included pc games if i added my ps2 and xbox games it would have been around 200 to 250)</p>
<p>also I own no next gen consoles just my computer and a ps2 and Xbox.</p>

            <p>(Note: I’m not including games for the Xbox 360 or PS3 because frankly consoles can go to hell  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>
<p>You’re right about Sims 3, it’s an alright game, but it’s not worth the money. If you really want it I reccomend torrenting it or something. Either that or play Sims 2 and sprinkle glitter on the screen and thats basically Sims 3.</p>
<p>As far as other games are concerned, it depends on what area of gaming you like. If you’re on a budget then definitely by the Orange Box. That includes the Half Life series from Half Life 2 up till Episode 2, as well as Portal which is just as entertaining and Team Fortress 2 which frequently gets updated with new content. So it’s 5 games, 1 box, for about £25ish. I’ve seen it for cheaper in my local area and I’ve no idea about prices in other countries but needless to say, it’s worth a look if you’re strapped for cash.</p>
<p>Something like Bioshock would be another good game to look at if you haven’t already got that. An art deco style FPS/RPG set in an underwater city where you can genetically mod your body to be a fire wielding, telekenetic power house. What’s not to love? I personally loved the story and I’ve already pre-ordered the sequel, which is being released March 2010.</p>
<p>The important thing here is to think about what your personally enjoy as a gamer, whether that be story or graphics, gameplay or even specific series/developers. I’d recommend that you don’t just go on what people say though, even myself. Take some time out to look at reviews and gameplay footage and see what interests you. Hope you find what you’re looking for  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>How about ‘Knights of the Old Republic’ 1 &amp; 2. Number 1 has an awesome storyline… which is kind of let down by number 2 but… Both games should be relatively cheap and are  guaranteed to work on any computer made after 2007  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>They also kill quite a lot of time. Mind you though, if you aren’t that interested in Star Wars is might seem like a bit of a drag…</p>

<p>While I’m glad you agree with me, I’m just wondering why you would bother replying “This” to a comment that was just posted? Maybe a “This. Mass Effect was soooo awesome! Can’t wait for Mass Effect 2!”</p>

<p>Hehe I just wanted to quote a post with only ‘this’ for once.</p>
<p>Mass Effect was great. One of those rare games that sucked me in and didn’t let me go till I finished it. It’s a great combo of a third person shooter and an rpg. The weapon changing systems etc work nicely. The story’s great. The voice acting superb. The graphics very beautiful and atmospheric. I’m glad my pc didn’t have any problem running it at full. Wouldn’t wanna have to miss that.</p>
<p>And no I can’t wait for part 2. I hope my pc can still play that on full. I do presume so, though.</p>

<p>meh, it was ok. I only played the first half, but that was enough to make me realize how cheesy the voice acting is. and games that don’t have all of the difficulty settings unlocked at the start never get higher than an 8/10 from me.</p>
