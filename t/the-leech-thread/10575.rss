    <description>The guard in the beginning of Forget About Freeman says somethings about &quot;swimming in thw waters with shit and leeches&quot; once you get him to the ladder. since leeches are cut, this dialogue is irrelevant. What to do about it?</description>

            <p>I didn’t like them either. They were just there for the sake of it I feel.</p>
<p>Now that Black Mesa has amazingly scary/murky water, I feel like that’s enough to kind of set the mood without re-introducing pests that feel like the equivalent of flies on a hot day.</p>

            <p>The leeches in the original were a pest, not hard at all, but just really annoying and no fun whatsoever. I’m glad they were cut.</p>

            <p>Roaches’ size is too small for a model, but in real life cockroaches are quite big. Roaches in BM seem to be even smaller than flies. Maybe if they were enlarged, they would become an NPC and be killable?</p>

</aside>
<p>Hardly noticeable apparently, as I totally missed them.</p>
<p>So I’ll restructure my inquiry. Since their appearance was far more minimalist than what was in the original game, why in particular was their presence downsized to noninteractive?</p>
<p>It’s obvious that they weren’t exactly a core mechanic of great importance, but it’s still, more or less as much of a noticeable omission to that of the leeches.</p>

            <p>…You could kill the antlion guard in ep2. You just had to wait to be <span class="bbcode-i">allowed</span> to kill it. Now that I think about it though, why couldn’t you kill it again? I believe the extract was from a hive, not the guard.</p>
<p>That is weird though how playtesters couldn’t see the leeches. Those areas for me seem almost <span class="bbcode-i">too</span> bright. Maybe I just have the brightness on my monitor too high.</p>

            <p>The waters in Power Up and Apprehension seem quite empty and dull without them. I would be glad if they implemented them as a harmless prop, like they said they might do.</p>

            <p>I don’t really see why they were removed either. They aren’t a complex enemy, and it makes almost no difference whether they are there not. I think the answer could lie within another question. Were they removed, or were they just not put in?</p>

<p>Why a dumb idea?  They’re hardly an integral part of the game.  The devs had far more important things to get on with.</p>

<p>Its an enemy, it makes water levels more interesting, and leeches ae far more important than dumb over the top “on prupose” voice acting for Hecu.</p>

<p>I, for one, was very glad that they were cut.</p>
<p>From a design standpoint they had little value in the original, providing nothing other than a minor irritation for the water sections.</p>
<p>From a logical standpoint they didn’t make any sense and nor did combatting them.</p>

<li>If they’re terrestrial leeches, how did they even get to a perfectly functioning underground science facility in the middle of the desert?[COLOR=‘Red’]They are from Xen</li>
<li>What kind of state of the art environmental hazard protection suit with reactive armor would be prone to leeches, terrestrial or otherwise?[COLOR=‘Red’]Leeches consume suit energy, also, What kind of state of the art environmental hazard protection suit with reactive armor would be prone to claw attacks from zombies, vorts and kicks from human soldiers?</li>
<li>You can’t swing a crowbar underwater proficiently enough to kill a leech in real life.[COLOR=‘Red’]Is this real life?</li>
<li>Why, for the love of jesus christ, would you be fucking about trying to kill leaches in the middle of an alien invasion? Priorities, Freeman.[COLOR=‘Red’]same reason why you kill roaches?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m going to assert that they are not missed by the silent majority.</p>
