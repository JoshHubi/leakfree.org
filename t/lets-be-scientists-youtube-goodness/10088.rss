    <description>Hey ladies and gents,

I know there&#39;s bound to be a few of these threads around, but i&#39;m doing a LP of Black Mesa. 

So, well, why watch me play it instead of playing it yourself? No reason what so ever, go play it if you&#39;re asking yourself that question!!  :smiley: 

However, i&#39;m trying to start a little something on YouTube (just like everyone else these days). I played HL when it first came out and I&#39;ve been waiting for a while to play BMP, all that&#39;s missing now is a Op Forces Source Remake and I&#39;ll be a happy chappy.

Anyway, If you&#39;d like to check it out, here&#39;s my Channel: 
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/user/SirPwnography&#39;]https://www.youtube.com/user/SirPwnography[/url]

The first episode is uploading now (I&#39;m british therefore my upload is SHIT.)
Check back and it should be up in a few hours or feel free to watch some of the other content. I thought i&#39;d post this before I go to sleep. 

Anyway, thank you for your time and far more importantly THANK YOU BLACK MESA PROJECT!!  :smiley:   :smiley:   :smiley:
