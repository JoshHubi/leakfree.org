    <title>Residue Processing, Maintenance Access pipe; can&#39;t get through</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/residue-processing-maintenance-access-pipe-cant-get-through/14974</link>
    <description>Congrabulations to the Crowbar people!  Wonderful bit of work, guys!
However, I have an odd problem:  I can&#39;t get through first 90-degree bend (to the left) in the &quot;maintenance access&quot; pipe near the very beginning of &quot;Residue Processing&quot;.   Nothing helps.
Tried a suggestion from a Half-Life discussion, and used the &quot;-autoconf&quot;, then &quot;-safe&quot; launch parameters.  &quot;-safe&quot; seemed to help a bit, in that I can get out of the pipe after being stuck, but that&#39;s all.
I&#39;m running under Mint 18 (based on Ubuntu 16.04).  Have had no trouble up to that point; is there a &quot;noclip&quot; trick I can use to get past the pipe?  Or anything else?
I&#39;d love to finish this game...</description>

            <p>If he input noclip and sv_cheats wouldn’t be on, he’d get a message about it.<br>
His problem is the console doesn’t even show up.</p>
<p>To get it to show up, right click on Black Mesa in Steam, click on “Properties”, “Set Launch Options” and copy paste this:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">-console -windowed -noborder</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">You’ll get the console and you can now alt-tab the game without it going mad.</span></p>

            <p>To use <span class="bbcode-i">noclip  </span>you first need to turn cheats on.  In the console, type:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">sv_cheats 1<br>
</span></p>
<p>Then try <span class="bbcode-i">noclip</span> and it should work.  To turn cheats off, <span class="bbcode-i">sv_cheats 0</span>.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>Thanks!  I should have tried to find a console if the first place!  <em>blush</em><br>
But… while  ‘noclip’ is certainly  recognized by the console (“help noclip” gives a usage message), but in my copy of the game, does nothing.  I tried it with the “Advanced…” --&gt;  “Enable developer console” box ticked &amp; unticked.  Nada.<br>
I did notice that the console is brought up not by a tilde, but by a back-tick  (`) .   Don’t know if that means anything.  I must be missing something.<br>
Ah, well.  I can always do something constructive (read: boooring) while I wait for a fix.</p>

            <p>You could type noclip in the console, fly past it and type noclip again when done yes.</p>
<p>Or wait for the devs to release their new fix for the bug, it’s on the way.</p>
