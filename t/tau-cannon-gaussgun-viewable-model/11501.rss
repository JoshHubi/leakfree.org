    <title>Tau Cannon/Gaussgun Viewable Model</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tau-cannon-gaussgun-viewable-model/11501</link>
    <description>Hi again, you might remember me from my other thread where I was looking for the texture files for the medkit and battery.

Basically, I&#39;m attempting a Half Life themed cosplay, where I&#39;ll be dressed as a scientist, and I&#39;m going to be making a Tau Cannon as a prop.

I have access to the supplies I&#39;ll need and I think I&#39;ll wire it so the thing in the middle spins and a light is emitted at the front.

Now, for the problem--

I need to look at the BMS Tau Cannon model so I can get the best accuracy. The images on the wiki only show a few sides, and I need to see the back where the stock and underside is.

I&#39;ve attempted setting up BMS to work with Source SDK&#39;s Model Viewer with Hezus&#39;s tutorial stickied on one of the boards, but I kept getting errors, and trying to look at the model with Nem&#39;sTools model viewer only renders the .mdl without textures. :meh:


If anyone can, could someone upload the Tau Cannon so I can view it in 3DS Max, Garrys Mod, or any of the Source model viewers, and instructions on how to use it?

Thanks in advance, I&#39;d really like to get this done before Halloween.

Oh, and when it&#39;s done, I&#39;ll be sure to post an in depth review and maybe even a guide on the show-off board :3

<p>Thank you so much, this solved my problem. Now I can view any of the models that I need to.</p>
<p>Again, thanks, I’ll be an Anomalous Materials Experimental Weapons designer in no time! :bms:</p>

            <p>Well,l you can copy and paste the models and materials from the BMS directory to the directory of any other source game (HL2, TF2, DoD, take your pick) and load the models from model viewer.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I took the liberty of taking this screenshot.<br>
The viewmodel was one sided, and a little obscured, so this is the worldmodel.</p>

<p>I do hope this helps <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Bump, anyone out there that could help?</p>
<p>I need this quite soon, it would make my design process much easier.</p>
<p>If you can’t supply the model, can I have a tutorial on how to get the model working in the SDK?</p>

            <p>Sounds like a worthy cause to me!</p>
<p>…Too bad I have absolutely zero talent with this kind of thing.<br>
My only idea would require you to be able to wait for the Steam release. I know, not helpful.</p>
