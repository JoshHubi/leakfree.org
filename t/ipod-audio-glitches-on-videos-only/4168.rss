    <title>iPod Audio Glitches (On Videos only)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ipod-audio-glitches-on-videos-only/4168</link>
    <description>Hey guys, just experiencing some issues with videos I&#39;ve been converting and placing on my iPod. I recently converted a copy of Avatar to my iPod and an episode of Doctor Who. When I played them on my iPod I experienced strange clicking throughout the video. When I switch the audio to Mono I don&#39;t have an issue. I&#39;m using Videora iPod converter 5.04. For Doctor Who I selected iPod (5th Gen) as the profile (in Power Mode) and for Avatar I selected iPod Touch (3rd Gen). Hope you guys can help!  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Thanks man, I found one that works well!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, it converts it to iPod Classic files and comes out square!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for a decent iPod Touch video Converter?</p>
