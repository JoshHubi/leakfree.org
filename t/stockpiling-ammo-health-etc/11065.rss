    <description>In HL2, unlike HL1, it is possible to pick up ammo, health, suit energy cells, etc - so long as you&#39;re at maximum for that resource type.

I&#39;ve found myself stockpiling consumables - picking them up, moving them along with me, throwing them down the hallway, etc.

At one point (I&#39;ve not been doing it that much yet) I had three suit energy cells, two health packs, two grenade shells and some shotgun ammo.

Of course, it&#39;s a pain to do, but it&#39;s worth it for the suit energy cells.</description>

</aside>
<p>Probably I don’t need to, in the sense that the game is ultimately co-operative in that it as you say weakens you, then makes you strong.  The game wants you to survive and in an at times deliberately touch-and-go fashion, for enjoyment.</p>
<p>However, if you wish to maximize your chances of survival, you may act to improve your chances by collecting equipment.</p>
<p>Essentially, I don’t like being weak, so I try to avoid being weak.</p>

<p>Never done it. Never needed to.</p>
<p>Half-Life has this brilliant way of dwindling you down low and giving you supplies just at the moment you need them most. Awesome level design to be honest.</p>
<p>Edit: That said it was definitely better in HL 1, in HL2 I found myself leaving all sorts of crap behind.</p>

<p>I’ve honestly never had the slightest bit of trouble with the last turret standoff in the portal room, even without carrying over any extra turrets.</p>
<p>I just place them in the middle of the room and they shoot anything that came through any of the doors. Sometimes they even kill all the elites who are supposed to come in while you’re escaping and knock over the turrets with energy balls.</p>

<p>Thing was, at that point there were so many loose items that I couldn’t possibly have picked up the right one, and even if I did, it would most likely have bounced off a soldier and blew up in my face anyway.</p>

<p>… I rigged the combine have 140 health and do multiplayer damage on their weapons. (you do too)</p>
<p>On a further note, I did find it necessary to transfer ammo from a previous engagement with the HECU to another area I just pulled all the rockets from the Wack’a’freeman area and chucked them through the door before going there myself… I again increased the health &amp; damage of npcs to make the game tougher… needed the ammo.</p>

            <p>I’ve only done this in Half-Life 2 and episodes, where I knew I’d need to hold up until something specific happened. I’d roam around the larger area and carry everything to a central location, kind of like in L4D2.</p>
<p>Since Half-Life, and by extension Black Mesa, doesn’t have situations like that, I never really found it necessary to do this.</p>

            <p>I have done this occasionally as well, it’s very useful on hard difficulty.<br>
I guess this advantage gets balanced by the fact that you can hold less ammo and grenades, especially ammo for the MP5’s grenade launcher, yout used to hold up 10 grenades, not 3.</p>
