Just a little shamelessly promotion of a map I just finished making, it features a small map with lots of weapons and close combat. Players start with the &quot;basic&quot; weapons scattered around the map,
and more powerful weapons will spawn as the map is played. The health of each player has been increased, just a tiny tiny bit. Nothing to worry about.
The reason behind that is that I wanted to see how firefights would play out if they lasted a little longer. Just a tiny bit longer.

I hope I don&#39;t have to touch displacements again.
If there are any bugs I&#39;ll fix them asap, just don&#39;t take the map too seriously.</description>
