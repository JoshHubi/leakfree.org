    <description>This is for those of you who play All Points Bulletin.

[b]Pioneering Dundee-based computer games company Realtime Worlds has gone into administration putting hundreds of jobs at risk.[/b]

[url=&#39;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-11003456&#39;]Full Story is here.[/url]

Personally I feel this is very sad news, as they listened to their community and have made a rather great game, if a buyer is found, hopefully they&#39;ll continue to run the game servers and the development of APB.
Good luck to them in finding a decent buyer.</description>

<p>Blame Microsoft.  They waited way too long before they decided if they even wanted to have a second Crackdown.  The game wasn’t even in pre-production when they ran the first trailer last year at E3, which is why it wasn’t really different than the first game.</p>
<p>It’s kinda sad that this game might be gone before I have the ability to play it, I’ve been watching it for a while, but only have a shitty laptop and an old-ass desktop.</p>

            <p>they sure need to put up﻿ something interesting during loading because loading takes a long time with this game. even if you have a top of the line PC.</p>
<p>seriously badly coded. just like the PC version of GTA IV.</p>
<p>If you can’t make a decent PC game just stick with consoles.</p>

            <p>APB was a massive failure on many counts. Attempting to add Punkbuster through a patch days after release is not a good way to stop cheaters. Particularly when it lags the game so badly that only the aimbotters can actually fight. The combat is unbalanced half the time, the driving controls are difficult, and in general the game is an unfinished product. With work it can improve, but the coolest things about APB right now are the customization options and the loading screen.</p>

            <p>i was really interested in it until i found out it was playable with a monthly subscription only. im probably missing the point of the game, but personally a one-time purchase of a game with multiplayer would be a better investment for me</p>

            <p>Makes me sad. Though APB isn’t particularly good, it could have become very good eventually. I hope another developer takes over that knows what they are doing.</p>

            <p>I heard about this too but couldn’t confirm it, thank you Door!<br>
It’s sad indeed to see them at this point, hopefully they’ll find a buyer in the industry. It’s a tough market <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
