    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/they-just-changed-too-much/10005</link>
    <description>i&#39;ve been waiting for this mod for a while, believe me i want to enjoy it, but they changed way too much with this.

environment
the most obvious change anyone will notice is the added in or modified areas in the mod, it wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it was just small changes to areas once in a while but they threw in entire new chunks to maps every ware just to do it. i wanted to play through the definitive edition of black mesa, not a re-imagining and the worst part is nobody asked for this and level design time could have been spent on other things like death match or maybe even decay co-op, and now they are completely re-doing xen to be even longer which than causes canon issues with opposing force since it was only a short time after going to xen that Gordon beat the aliens and than the full force of species x started pouring in. so many of the changes were unnecessary and could have been used for other stuff.

weapons and combat
I&#39;ve only been able to play briefly(ridiculous load times) but i cant believe the combat changes that I&#39;m seeing, number one the zombie combat, now with the new way it attacks its almost impossible to melee without getting hit and it doesn&#39;t resemble original zombies OR HL2 zombies, same goes for the dog....thing you know what I&#39;m talking about, its combat reaction is way to fast. and even the barnacles which should be a simple one hit have been changed to be harder to melee. With all of these issues the crowbar is now almost completely useless, you don&#39;t #$%# with the crowbar! and the pistol, shoots way to fast probably because they Nerf&#39;d the bullet count, every time i shoot that thing it feels like I&#39;m going &quot;kill it! kill it with fire! kill it!&quot;

change can be good, but this much change in the maps AND combat is ridiculous, i honestly cant recommend this game to friends for a half-life experience and will probably tell them to get the original and HD pack. hopefully operation black mesa and guard duty stay true to their core</description>

<p>Seriously, if you have a problem with the devs’ interpretation of what Black Mesa should be, then why don’t you go off and spend the next eight years of your life remaking Half-Life in its entirety, fully voice acted and featuring a professionally composed soundtrack.</p>
<p>You’re complaining that the devs made the mod how both they and pretty much everybody else here in the forums thought it should be - but you didn’t. And I’m sorry to say, sunshine, that the world doesn’t revolve around you. Everybody here loves the devs’ interpretation of the mod. You don’t? Go to <a href="http://forums.wehateblackmesasource.com" rel="nofollow noopener">forums.wehateblackmesasource.com</a> and voice your complaints there to the community who really care about what you have to say.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa is not Half-Life with better graphics. Think of it as a remake of an old movie, with new effects, actors, and also a refreshed story with modified scenes. The iconic things are there, but many things are different.</p>
<p>Imagine if after 8 years of development, and a decade and a half after the original game came out, all you would have is Half-Life, but with better graphics. If every enemy, every room, every corridor was the same, just looked better… You could play it with your eyes closed, and it would not even stimulate your mind.</p>

            <p>I actually like the maps being altered.  Half-Life?  I knew Half-Life’s maps, there was nothing to explore, I’d seen it all.  Black Mesa?  I get to go “Ooo, what’s over here?  And there?  Oh man, what’s that!?”  all over again, just like I did in 2000 when I first played Half-Life on my Pentium III machine.</p>

            <p>I do think Surface Tension could have included some more of the original elements. Like from when you get the snarks and the vent gets pelleted with bullets, skips straight to the Garg sequence and the mortars. That took me by surprise, and doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense. IMO it probably would’ve been better if they kept everything that should’ve gone in-between.</p>
<p>Overall it really isn’t bad though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Half-Life with better graphics already exists, it’s called Half-Life: Source.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Would that that had better graphics. Half-Life: Source is just as dated as the original, except it has ragdolls and the cliff face has a very rushed 3D backdrop instead of a 2D one. Truth be told, I’d rather play Half-Life over Source, because at least for that I can use the Blue Shift high-rez weapons pack.</p>
<p>As for changes, I really don’t mind Black Mesa not being a perfect copy of Half-Life. It’s not the same game, after all. And indeed, the changes are outright better in a lot of places. The trouble is that the Black Mesa team clearly didn’t like everything in Half-Life, and a lot of the things they “fixed” I actually really enjoyed. On a rail, for instance, has been cut down to no more than half its length, with most of the non-train sections outright removed. Surface Tension has, similarly, been cut down drastically. There was supposed to be a whole other building in-between Barney letting you into the weapons store room and getting to the cannon to blow up the gate. That’s gone completely.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t go as far as to badmouth Black Mesa for it, but it really is considerably shorter than the original Half-Life because it simply misses large chunks of level in many, many places. As well, a LOT of the platforming segments that still exist have been bypassed almost entirely. Residue Processing is the most obvious. There’s no more jumping on floating meat chunks, the pistons room has partially-collapsed catwalks that provide static rest stops between piston jumps and the mixer tank no longer requires you to jump from mixer to mixer, because there’s a path which leads to the forward mixer and right out to the next room.</p>
<p>And for not being a carbon copy of Half-Life, Black Mesa still has sections that ARE carbon-copies of Half-Life locations. The main chamber in Blast Pit is a perfect recreation, right down to where the grating on the floor is, where it’s broken and even the hidden area that you have to be pulled up into by a barnacle creature. There’s also a spot in Questionable Ethics - climbing a set of stairs - that’s one-to-one exact with Half-Life, right down to the enemy spawn points, and those are non-talking enemies.</p>
<p>If anything, I wish Black Mesa were longer, and I’m not just referring to Xen. I want more “On a Rail” and more “Surface Tension” and more "Residue Processing and so forth. I can see the need to cut them down as a Source engine game takes a LOT longer to make levels for than an old Half-Life style 1990s FPS, so I’m not holding them to task… But I miss the chunks that aren’t there.</p>

<p>You can always download a HD pack to your Half-Life: Source and get “Half-Life with better graphics” just look it up on youtube</p>
<p>EDIT: <a class="mention" href="/u/bloodshot">@Bloodshot</a>, actually that’s the best thing they did. Colt Python had little to no purpose in the original game, this way it’s being used more.</p>

            <p>I really did expect this to be more different than the original than it is. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the changes they’ve made (with the exception of allowing the 357 to be acquired so early in place of the shotgun, even on hard it makes it a bit easy, they give too much ammo at those parts) as most of them take some of the things from HL1 that <span class="bbcode-i">don’t make sense</span> and most of them actually make the game more fun.</p>
<p>What the fuck would be the point of this mod if it was the same as HL1, brick for brick? Nothing. <span class="hashtag">#1</span>, and <span class="hashtag">#2</span>, it would have been done a long time ago if that’s what they were gonna do.</p>
<p>And wow, you CAN’T recommend this game to your friends because of A. map changes and B. Damage tweaks? God, this is physically painful to read.</p>

            <p>On the contrary, I actually expected things to be changed a bit more than this. I immediately recognize everything from the original, but there’s just enough originality to keep it fresh and entertaining.</p>
<p>Regarding gameplay, yes there are some changes, but some of the things you’ve stated are just incorrect. It’s very easy to melee zombies without getting hit back, even on hard mode. Try again. Barnacles were never one hit kills in the original either (perhaps they were on easy mode, but I’ve never played that). The crowbar is perfectly effective against zombies and headcrabs. Even vortigaunts die to the crowbar very fast, if you somehow get too close.</p>
<p>Also Blue Shift and Opposing Force are not technically considered 100% canon, they are allowed to be retconned, though they are referenced. <a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half-Life_Wiki:Canon" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half-Life_Wiki:Canon</a></p>
<p>Given how invalid most of these complaints are, I almost have to assume this is just a trolling attempt.</p>

            <p>I have a simple solution to your problem…</p>
<p>Clearly you want to play the original game…so why don’t you just load up the original version of half life.<br>

            <p>You must understand the amount of detail original Half Life was capable of and the amount Source Engine is.

            <p>Yeah, they’ve always said it won’t be 1:1. Just pretend it wasn’t supposed to be and you’ll see how <span class="bbcode-i">fucking amazing</span> this game is without question.</p>

You are either retarded or can’t read. Half-Life with better graphics already exists, it’s called Half-Life: Source<br>
Just play that if you dislike this FREE game/mod</p>
<p>Or just google up wiki and look at what “remake” stands for.</p>

<p>Huh. You complain about changing canon (which a longer Xen sequence doesn’t, btw) yet Valve retcon all the time. You complain about the load times when Episode 2 has even longer ones, and you complain about changing game mechanics when Valve has also done that with every single game (flashlight, sprinting, jumping, firing speed, etc.) Including crowbar damage. Maybe rather than complain about what you’ve played in your brief time you should actually play it as its own game rather than moaning about how different it is from Half Life. And the combat is not ‘ridiculous.’ I would not have been able to beat it otherwise.</p>

</aside>
<p>read my post, Xen does effect canon. and valve hasn’t done anything with half-life before that’s retconed anything. and the episode 2 load times on my computer are far shorter than the ones i get with BMS. and none of valves changes in the past have been bad because its new enemies and new weapons(minus crowbar) and they fit well with each other and it still felt like playing a half-life game, this dosen’t. and why did you list flashlight? that’s always been there</p>

            <p>They’ve pretty much always advertised as being a reimagining, not a remake, but every seems similar enough to the original to me. I’ll admit I was expecting it to stick a bit closer to the original than it did, but it didn’t and blew me away. Nobody had to “ask for it,” the team did this of their own accord. Load times are probably your fault, though. It’s likely your hardware over the game, I loaded in under 20 seconds almost everytime. I can level with you on the barnacles, though. They seemed a teeny bit too tough.</p>

            <p>Okay, skyace65. If YOU consider it canon, then I guess the whole internet is wrong.</p>
<p>But yeah - I would always recommend my friends to play the original game anyway. So, you can always just play that one.</p>

<p>but blue shift is about how barney got out of black mesa, and neither of the expansions contradict the first one so i would consider them canon</p>

<p>Black Mesa has always been a re-imagining of Half-Life, pal. It was never meant to be a carbon copy of the original game. You don’t have to consider this mod to be canon - that is, and will always be, Half-Life. So saying that Black Mesa is breaking the canon for games that ARE NOT canon (believe it or not, Opposing Force and Blue Shift are not part of the main continuum) sounds a bit strange, to say the least.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>opposing force just hasn’t been referenced by future games yet. but blue shift is DENEIATELY canon.</p>
