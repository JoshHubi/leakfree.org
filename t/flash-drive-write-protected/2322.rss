    <title>Flash Drive Write Protected</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/flash-drive-write-protected/2322</link>
    <description>This just started happening a few minutes ago. I usually run Firefox from my flash drive and recently when I tried to run it a message popped up that said &quot;Cannot Run, USB Drive is Write Protected&quot; or something along those lines. The only thing that I&#39;ve been doing different than normal is copying over Steam game files from another computer because the computer I play them on can&#39;t dowload the games without freezing. Anyone know what happened and how I can fix it?</description>

            <p>Corsair is known for very reliable products, I think your replacement unit will last much longer.</p>

            <p>Okay, I formatted it to both formats and both times I could copy files to it for around 20 minutes (trying to copy back all the files I copied off of it) but then it would give me the same error. It’s under a warranty so I’ll probably replace it. Right now I’m using another flash drive that I used before though it’s not as large, only 8GB instead of 32GB.</p>
<p>The one that is having the problems is <a href="https://www.corsair.com/products/survivor/default.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> one, really big and bulky. I got it for a gift though so I didn’t get to pick exactly which one I wanted, and most likely wouldn’t have got this one. It didn’t get all that good reviews either.</p>

            <p>NTFS</p>
<p>And flash drives seem to have alot of filesystem problems, I had a 8gb flash drive but I guess it committed suicide because now whenever I plug it to the computer it detects it and gives a drive letter but says that there’s no disk in the drive.</p>

            <p>I guess I could move all the stuff and then format it, though I would prefer not to. I’ll do it if there’s no other way.</p>
<p>I tried formatting it and it kept saying that it was write protected. I looked it up and someone suggested to go to the drive from the CMD and it worked. I formatted it to NF… something. Can’t ever remember the acronym. So now I’m copying over all the files which I copied from it.</p>
