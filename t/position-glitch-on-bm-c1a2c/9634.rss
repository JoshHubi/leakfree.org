    <title>position glitch on bm_c1a2c</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/position-glitch-on-bm-c1a2c/9634</link>
    <description>map and position concerned by the glitch :

map :
bm_c1a2c

getpos : 
setpos 1616.000000 -899.081116 75.622787;setang 0.031073 -85.045120 0.000000

Details of the problem:

I was going from bm_c1a2b (where we see multiple vortigaunts spawning in offices) to bm_c1a2c through the ventilations (by the ladder above a couch) and i was stuck (too low in the ventilation duct) just after the loading of bm_c1a2c finished. upon reloading, i was even lower than before reloading (like seen in the screenshots) (in half-life 1, this duct was used to allow you to go disable a turret protecting stairs)

nevertheless, great game so far  :slight_smile:
