    <title>Mic acting strange</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mic-acting-strange/2558</link>
    <description>I got a headset, some logitech thing.
Anyway, it&#39;s recognized, as mic as it should be.
However it doesn&#39;t work. Not in Steam, not in Teamspeak, not in MW2.
But when I blow in it, I can hear the sound coming out my speakers, at all times. Which, as far as I know, Isn&#39;t supposed to happen either.

And a few days earlier it worked just fine with the same settings.

Anyone got an idea?

EDIT: Nevermind. Appearantly my front mic port it just fucked up.</description>

            <p>Ive got the logitech fatality gaming headset hs-1000 and ive never had any problems with it, I suppose the mic should be similar. Not to insult your intelligence, but have you tested it in control panel, set it up properly etc., more info plz.</p>

            <p>yep. let me see if I can find my big story I wrote. BRB.</p>
<p>BACK:</p>
<p>Dont buy logitech headsets.</p>
<p>Long ago, I had a logitech headset. I will call this headset 1. I play tfc rather regularly and I never had a problem with it.</p>
<p>A kind friend gave me another headset that was a bit nicer. I will call this headset 2. Again, both headsets work fine for tfc.</p>
<p>One day I decide to try out tf2. No one could hear me in game. I messed around with my audio properties, I messed around with the mic… no help whatsoever. Headset 1 refused to work in tf2. I would flip over to tfc, and it worked but the moment I flipped back over to tf2 it didnt work. I figured I had a setting somewhere goofy, but I couldnt pinpoint it.</p>
<p>Headset 2 DID work on both tho so I tossed out headset 1 which was the logitech.</p>
<p>A year later… headset 2 starts to crackle and cut out and I need a new headset. I forgot about my problems a year ago, so I go out and buy another logitech… headset 3. I play tfc and everyone can hear me.</p>
<p>My kid fires up tf2 and starts complaining that people cant hear him. I dig headset 2 out of the garbage and plug it in, (I didnt even close out of the game… I just unplugged one and plugged the other in) BINGO! people could hear him. (It was crackling like there was a short, but they could hear him). I tossed out headset 2 again, I returned headset 3 and purchased a different brand and now am playing both tfc and tf2 with headset 4! lol.</p>
<p>Moral of the story, sometimes it is just easier to return one product and purchase a different brand.</p>
