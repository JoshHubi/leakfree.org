    <title>Pokemon Stadium Doppelbanger</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pokemon-stadium-doppelbanger/13774</link>
    <description>The two-part and nine-year [b]development of [i][url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3&#39;]Mother 3[/url][/i][/b], a role-playing video game, took place between 1994 and 2006 with a three year gap in-between, and spanned four consoles and multiple delays. Following the commercial success of its predecessor, [i][url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_2&#39;]Mother 2[/url][/i] ([i]EarthBound[/i] outside of Japan), [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(video_game_series)&#39;][i]Mother[/i] series[/url] creator [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigesato_Itoi&#39;]Shigesato Itoi[/url] was given the previous game&#39;s development team. Inspired by [i][url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64&#39;]Super Mario 64[/url][/i], the team set out to create a 3D game that ultimately exceeded the capabilities of the platform and changed their console focus from the [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Famicom&#39;]Super Famicom[/url] to the [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64&#39;]Nintendo 64[/url] and its [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64DD&#39;]64DD[/url] [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto-optical_drive&#39;]magneto-optical drive[/url] expansion peripheral, for which it was expected to be a 1998 launch title. Upon the [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_failures_in_video_gaming&#39;]commercial failure[/url] of the 64DD, it was converted to the cartridge-only format. Itoi thought of the game&#39;s concept during [i]Mother 2[/i] &#39;s development and built a 12-chapter story with player-characters that rotated between chapters. Having been a producer during [i]Mother 2[/i], Itoi served as a scriptwriter during [i]Mother 3[/i] &#39;s development. A North American version was announced as [i][b]EarthBound 64[/b][/i], but did not materialize when the 60 percent-complete Japanese release was cancelled in August 2000 in reprioritization leading up to [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Dolphin&#39;]Project Dolphin[/url] (the code name of the [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube&#39;]GameCube[/url]). At the time, the game was estimated to need another two years of work. After multiple years and failed petitions, [i]Mother 3[/i] was reannounced for the [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance&#39;]Game Boy Advance[/url] in 2003 within a Japanese television commercial for [i][url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_1%2B2&#39;]Mother 1+2[/url][/i], a [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting#Porting_in_gaming&#39;]port[/url] of [i][url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_(video_game)&#39;]Mother[/url][/i] and [i]Mother 2[/i] to the Advance. The game kept its original story and received a graphical overhaul in a [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixelation&#39;]pixelated[/url] style similar to [i]Mother 2[/i]. The game&#39;s themes included [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_physiology&#39;]human physiology[/url], renewal, and fungibility on the morality spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained the quirky style of series composers [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiichi_Suzuki_(composer)&#39;]Keiichi Suzuki[/url] and [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirokazu_Tanaka&#39;]Hirokazu Tanaka[/url]. [i]Mother 3[/i] was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It did not receive a North American release.
