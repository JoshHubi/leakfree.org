            <p>I think I saw that too, it was pretty scary actually. They were giving really potent antidepressants to kids going through normal teenager stuff, and of course that would only cause problems.</p>

<p>At this point it’s obvious that there’s something wrong with all the people doing these killings. It’s not video games, it’s not guns, there’s something that is causing all this mental instability. We should work on finding that out rather than spending millions of dollars trying to pointlessly ban one thing or another that people have personal vendettas against.</p>

<p>I watched a documentary about how schools are brainwashing kids, and they brought up how ALL of the major school shootings were done by kids on antidepressants made for adults but marketed for kids</p>

<p>Well, virtually nobody uses an assault rifle in a crime. An Assault Rifle by definition is a select fire (2 or more fire settings, safety does not count) that uses an intermediate cartridge (larger than pistol, smaller than battle rifle) and a detachable magazine. The vast majority of rifles owned by civilians are semi-automatic only. Often times the difference between a semi-automatic hunting rifle and a semi-automatic AR-15 is looks alone, and that’s when you realise that a lot of lawmakers are either hypocritical idiots (<span class="bbcode-u">Feinstein!</span> don’t get me started on her) or scapegoating so they don’t have to do any real work (probably a good number of them).</p>
<p>Getting a hold of a <span class="bbcode-i">real</span> Assault Rifle costs thousands of dollars in licensing and registration fees, the rifle itself also costs several thousand. Nobody is going to use their $6000 Assault Rifle in the commission of a crime when they can get a pistol or shotgun for under $300 elsewhere (assuming they don’t just steal one from somewhere else).</p>
<p>Hoping I don’t seem like a gun-nut here, but it’s nice to know things when it’s such a hot subject. I try to keep my own personal opinions out when being informative.</p>

<p>Eh, I don’t know about that. I guess it’s just that I don’t think that anyone really needs a Colt Carbine. Although you don’t need guns in general either, I suppose, but pistols and hunting rifles have certain uses, a pistol is a good defense weapon, and a hunting rifle is used for…hmmmm…I can’t remember… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
But who knows, if the background checks, license renewals, etc prove to help put things at ease, then maybe everyone who has an assault rifle can keep it.</p>

<p>At this point it’s obvious that there’s something wrong with all the people doing these killings.

</aside>
<p>I agree, although I still think some gun laws would be beneficial, but not a total ban of course, because that’s impossible and a waste of money, and an argument only outsiders who don’t really know the current situation use. We should start with national background checks, tests, gun license renewals, ban assault weapons, etc.</p>
<p>Oh, and Mr.Someguy has a point too.</p>

            <p>2 things: Mental Health and Media. These people are sick people, but the Media is also at fault for glorifying the killers. These people realise they can be famous if they go shoot up a school, they see it as a triple win. They get their revenge, end their miserable life, and everyone in the country will know their name.</p>

            <p>Well fuck…<br>
What if schools took action to bullying?As far as I know, most shootings occur because of bullying, and most of the time schools ignore the victims of bullying.</p>

            <p>Yeah but how would you go about doing that? No Law Enforcement officer wants to confiscate guns. Although not a widely known fact, there are upwards of 80 militia groups in 50 states, with up to 60,000 members.</p>
<p>We all remember the Waco Siege, where the ATF, FBI, and US Military cornered a cult / militia at their compound in Waco, Texas. The result was a failed raid that left 4 ATF Agents dead, and resulted in an explosion that lit the building on fire which killed 82 militants and cultists.</p>
<p>If there were to be a widespread confiscation of firearms, there would be a Law Enforcement nightmare. Pro-firearm Militias will stand off with Police, and that’s not counting the non-militia members who will refuse. Your reduced bloodshed in the long term would come at the cost of a lot of bloodshed in the short term.</p>

            <p>If the government banned guns in the U.S I’m sure shootings would be less.<br>
Though as far as I notice Americans wouldnt like that, and their excuse would be that they need to protect their freedom.</p>

            <p>What? Don’t give me that look. It was directed at the world population in general, not you guys.</p>
<p>Shootings, man. They gotta stop.</p>
