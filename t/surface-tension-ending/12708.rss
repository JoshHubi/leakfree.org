    <title>Surface Tension ending</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/surface-tension-ending/12708</link>
    <description>Hello,
The first time I played BM and reached the ending of Surface Tension, where a Garg is chasing you everything was normal, and by normal I mean normal compared to what happened on my SECOND playthrough of BM, which included the tactical map being extremely buggy (point flashing and disappearing often) and a single crash which happened when the gargantua was about to explode. The game minimized and after a few seconds, stopped working and a message was brough up, something like &quot;GAme crash: Gargantua left arm gib + Gargantua right arm gib = 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999000000000000000&quot;. I am attaching the mdmp file.
Any ideas what this can be caused by? I&#39;m afraid this small issue might affect the rest of the game, and of it&#39;s nothing serious then... just want the devs to know  :slight_smile:
