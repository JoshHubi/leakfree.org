    <title>Fallout: New Vegas Viewmodel Errors</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fallout-new-vegas-viewmodel-errors/6116</link>
    <description>Hello all,

In Fallout: New Vegas, suddenly and for no apparent reason, the viewmodel of my gun will begin acting up, performing such stunts as jerking high above my field of view and adjust my aim accordingly, sending my bullets far off target, jumping slightly too high and to the left, obscuring my screen, and occasionally vanishing entirely, causing my bullets to emanate mysteriously from a point about 5m in front of me on the floor.

It used to happen only when I scoped while in sneak mode, but now it happens randomly, and usually within 5 minutes of me starting the game. If I try to ignore it, it gradually worsens, eventually leaving my gun arm scrolling up and down the screen, sometimes vanishing entirely only to zoom laterally across my field of vision at high speed a second later. The most annoying part of it is it changes my aim too, making aiming a futile exercise.
This happens with all weapons, even melee/unarmed weapons and grenades, though it seems to be less severe with non-gun weaponry.

I&#39;ve scoured multiple internet forums for some way to fix it, but I&#39;ve found nothing, and more annoyingly, I seem to be the only person experiencing this problem.

If anyone has any idea on how to go about fixing this, please help me out, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks.</description>

<p>PC. I’ve had so many glitches with this game. I’ve played more than 90 hours of it, but never finished a file.</p>

<p>I have true iron sights disabled, but I have already tried re-enabling it and it does nothing towards fixing the issue. I’ll have a look on New Vegas Nexus for some sort of unofficial patch. Thanks.</p>

<p>-If “True Iron Sights” is disabled, many modded weapons when aimed will block the target reticule and obscure all view.<br>
-Sometimes your character will hold the gun above the screen if you’re in first person. Switching from first person to third person and back will fix this bug; alternatively, you can access your Pip-Boy.<br>
-When equipped with a two-handed gun in first-person mode, the weapon often clips mid-view, distorts, and slides to the top of the screen and behind the player’s perspective.</p>

<p>Is something like this happening to you? If not then there are a lotta bugs on that page I posted. Concerning Fallout the Vault Wiki is very useful in general.<br>
Maybe you can find some way to fix your bug there.<br>
i suggest you start by looking if this “true iron sights” option is enabled. I never quite realized it was there but you might find it somewhere in the graphics options.</p>
<p>Also, I agree to the previous post. The nexus is awesome.<br>
<a href="https://newvegasnexus.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://newvegasnexus.com/</a><br>
Here you may find an unofficial patch. Use the search option. You may need an account to download things there. That aside, there are some truly epic mods for the fallout series. If you want to know how to mod the game, send pm to me or search for tutorials on that page. Some authors were so kind as to post some useful advise<br>
Also, first post —&gt; hi</p>
