    <title>Laptop won&#39;t start</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/laptop-wont-start/8307</link>
    <description>Okay, so i have bought a HP laptop for about half a year ago. (Unfortunately, can&#39;t remember the name, threw the box away)

Anyways, the problem is that yesterday when i had to use it in school, the bastard wouldn&#39;t start. When i boot it up, it goes to the windows boot-up screen where i can choose to run windows like normal, or start windows repair. 
Now, if i choose to start windows like normal, it starts loading windows, but when it&#39;s done loading, it goes back to the menu, and i again have the two choices. 
If i choose to run windows repair, it opens a black window, you know like DOS, and it&#39;s says: &#39;REM couldn&#39;t detect 2 HDD&#39;s.&#39; Then it just stays on that screen until i turn of the computer.

So, i was wondering if there was anyone who have had the same problem, or if someone knows a solution? Thanks.</description>

            <p>Drive can’t be completely shagged or he wouldn’t be able to boot to anything.  Secondly why is it missing 2 drives?  Most laptops only have the one.  Could be HDD, but lets not throw it away right away.  See if you can get an XP disc, boot into the recover console and then run chkdsk and see what that returns.</p>

            <p>Well, I’d assume you can’t if it comes installed on the dead HDD.</p>

            <p>dead hdd. I’m thinking the repair software that comes pre-installed is on the same hdd as the windows installation.</p>
