    <title>How does gibbing work?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-does-gibbing-work/10682</link>
    <description>I thought gibbing happened when you knock a npc down to negative something health with a weapon that can gib.
However in BMS I only seem to be able to gib already dead units.  The TAU/GLUON guns can gib like they should but direct hits with grenades and rockets don&#39;t (another explosion will gib).</description>

            <p>I would say this is a symptom of another problem, that the explosives don’t do enough damage point blank.  Or perhaps that their damage diminishes too quickly as you move from the centre of the explosion.</p>

            <p>Dude I had this epic gib moment, but I forget exactly where it was. Three Vortigaunts spawn and sneak up from behind you in a normal sized room and cause serious damage. I reloaded the save to prepare for this fight by placing two of the available explosive barrels in the center of the room. I then proceeded, ran quickly behind cover, waited for the Vortigaunts to spawn, and shot one of the barrels. As all three Vortigaunts were charging up, they were ripped apart in a brutal explosion of blood and gibs, with pieces of their bodies flying in all directions at high speed. This must have been one of the most epic kills I have ever had in a video game.</p>

            <p>I noticed this as well. Either A. The required gibbing damage is too high for even explosions to effect them(and a charged Tau kills a heli and the Gluon instakills so this makes sense) B. Explosives can’t gib live enemies. I’m leaning towards A, and if it is, it might even be directly changeable from the console/config.</p>

            <p>things are gibed with explosives or high damaged hits, like a full charge of the tau cannon, also note houndeyes gib if you kill them while they are charging up.</p>
