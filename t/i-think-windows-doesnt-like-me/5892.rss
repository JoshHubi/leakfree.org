    <title>I think Windows doesn&#39;t like me</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-think-windows-doesnt-like-me/5892</link>
    <description>Specifically, it ran a startup repair after my computer crashed, and, despite saying I would only lose recently installed programs, the only things left are Tag: the power of paint, steam, firefox, (without bookmarks) and maybe a few other programs I have sitting around but don&#39;t use. I don&#39;t even have system preferences or my desktop background.

Also, McAfee security is still here, but doesn&#39;t want to work.

Shit happens?</description>

            <p>lol, your mind is bleeding! Yeah, it wasn’t as bad as that virus, but it was pretty bad. i can’t remember what would have happened if i  hadn’t fixed it, but it would have been very expensive.

<p>It’s nothing personal. Windows doesn’t like anybody.</p>
<p>It sounds like one of those problems where it seems like Windows is just fucking around with you and won’t tell you what’s going on. If you find a way to get to vanilla or factory default, you’ll have peace of mind. Until then, it can be really confusing and annoying.<br>
Best of luck.</p>

            <p>Nothing beats the smell of a freshly baked OS. With just the drivers and only a couple of apps installed… mmmm… Damn, now I’m actually tempted to reinstall myself.</p>
<p>Oh and windows IS a bitch. It won’t support hyperthreading on my CPU and Win7 is so much of a bitch it won’t install without it either.</p>

            <p>yeah. when you start to experience something like what you have, you might as well reformat and start vanilla.</p>

            <p>?? ^what?</p>
<p>Mcaffee sucks because of many reasons. The biggest ones being that its uses a butt load of resources in the background, has alot of interference, and has really bad detection rate. If you want a good anti virus, i suggest avira, or avast anti virus.</p>
<p>Oh yea, on topic: If I was in your case, I would just format the drive and re install windows. From what you’ve said so far, your computer must’ve hated you d:</p>
<p>Edit: Oh yea, I’ve heard of RATS that can delete windows core files, and really fuck you up, maybe that’s what happened?</p>

<p>How do I do that, exactly? And I don’t think recovery tools are what I need, since windows itself technically deleted everything.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>REcovery tools are basicly an installer that copies that hidden partition to your main partition, formatting it in the process. the way to be able to use it depends on the brand and model.</p>
<p>also,  get a better antivirus than mcafee.</p>
