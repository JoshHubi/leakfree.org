    <title>Empire Total War</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/empire-total-war/7561</link>
    <description>help!  I keep getting steamrolled!  my allies don&#39;t do shit!  (WTF Britain!  do something!)

do you [i]have to[/i] play the battles in order to win?  I sim all the battles, and even with my army 3x the size of theirs, I lose about every time when trying to defend my capitol (Amsterdam)  or at sea against pirates

seems like, on hard, it&#39;s the world against me rather than the world against the world, my enemies constantly grow in power and territory while my allies and trade partners sit idle and then get destroyed. :&#39;(

anyone else here play this game?
is it even possible to win on hard?  or am I just a strategy retard?</description>

<p>You’re not a strategic retard. The game itself is retard. I’ve played it and got pretty sick of it after a while. May I suggest Victoria 2 from Paradox? A much more enjoyable game if you’d ask me (albeit set in a later time period 1836-1936).</p>

            <p>oh, I usually get militia because the upkeep is so cheap, and I only had one school, which I used to research the humanities, I tried to buy technology when I had some extra money, but yeah, I had no war tech upgrades, I’m the Dutch, I have to win with Trade and culture and population growth and money</p>
<p>didn’t realize I could dismantle a factory or whatever and build a school, might have to start all over and get more schools</p>

            <p>You don’t have to play in the battles, but normally Humans are better at tactics than computers, also make sure you have top notch research and the best units you can get, no matter how poor you are.</p>
<p>I usually try and trade with every one I can and do a ton of research then once research is done to a good level, take out a few small nations then move on to the bigger ones.</p>
<p>Just don’t go round with militia.</p>

            <p>My brother plays the total war series a lot, and the auto battle is rubbish (I’ve seen him scare a large army away with 2-3 cavalry in shogun 2). You don’t need to play a battle to win, but you usually won’t without good odds. Also, in a city some of the troops could be from the population, these tend not to be the best of troops.</p>
<p>I’m not particularly good at total war battles but normally I can do better then the auto battler.</p>
