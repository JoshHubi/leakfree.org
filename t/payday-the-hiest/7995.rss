    <title>PAYDAY: The Hiest</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/payday-the-hiest/7995</link>
    <description>So this game just came out for PC today.  Medium size download game for 20$

Anyone else here have this / was interested in it?  I have it and have been playing it a bit.  Gameplay feels a lot like Left 4 Dead with a progression system.  Its a bit of a crappy console port atm but the devs have claimed to be addressing these issues in a patch. 

My biggest problem with it is not having any friends who own it (Akin to l4d it is a game that seems like it would be sooo much better with friends), so does anyone have it and would wanna play it some time?</description>

            <p>The gameplay itself plays out like l4d in a sense (IE semi-random and going to do certain tasks), but because you are fighting enemies with guns and its robbing stuff it doesn’t feel like l4d the pacing is a lot different.</p>

            <p>It sounded interesting when I thought it was kind of like a bank robbing simulation but now it sounds boring being “Left4Dead with cops” as I’ve heard it described.</p>
