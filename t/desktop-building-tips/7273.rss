    <description>I need Help with building my own computer the only problem I have is with finding the parts. Every thing that i looked so far had been too much or is not compatible with each other. I only have 500$, but i only want to use AMD so that i could play this game ([url]https://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/?snr=1_4_4__13[/url]). (Another thing I want to run be able to run black ops and gmod with no lag) The OS i can get with out using my money because my gave me a free win7 so that part im good on, but I do need a wireless card because the desktop will be in my room away from the router. I don&#39;t know who else to go to but if it is over the 500$ but like 150 or less then im fine. last thing I have tried to look but just had a really hard time finding the parts in my money range. And im not making another thread for this because it would get annoying so if I could get help with it i would be fine.</description>

            <p>That is the main reason of why I want it to upgrade it later, but do you know of a good keyboard that is not wireless. because i hate wireless, the keyboard and mouse keep dieing on me like every day (Or if you have will not kill the battery then im fine).(I only use the keyboard when I play Gmod on rp because this laptop is hard to play with)</p>

            <p>It sure will…<br>
There are (mostly) 3 types of cases:<br>
Mini towers, mid towers (like the ones we talked about earlier), and full towers (like the one you just linked.<br>
Mini towers usually only support Micro-ATX motherboards, which are, as their name suggets, quite small. Most motherboards are ATX. Just check in the detailed specs of the motherboard and the case to see if they’re compatible. Full towers are huge enough to fit basically any kind of motherboard in it, so you don’t have to worry about that.</p>
<p>I personally wouldn’t spend 200$ for a case, especially for a budget build, but it can be nice for future upgrading, I guess.</p>

            <p>im actually in the same postion as you bud, just my budgets about 100 bucks more and i’m trying to stick with Intel. From what I see, these guys have a pretty good rig going for you, but remember, the cases they showed you may be okay but you can pretty much go anywhere to find a case for the same price that looks better and suits your needs. <a href="http://Amazon.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon.com</a> is where im getting mine, but just google Desktop Cases and see what you find. Also before you drop the cash, be sure to check different sites. Newegg is sometimes your best choice but sometimes waiting or checking other sites will save you a good chunk of cash. Just remember to get a graphics card if you plan on playing games on it. Most decent Direct X9 and 10 cards run around 100 bucks or more. Just thoughts if you need any help, let me know since im in the market to do the same as you and i’ll see what i can do.</p>

            <p>You can either get an external USB wireless card, or you can find a PCI one (make sure the motherboard has a slot for it… the one I linked has one). These are usually pretty cheap… 10 or 20$ max I’d say.</p>
<p>That case is fine. It comes with 3 fans, which is pretty good. Make sure you read the comments about it to see if there are anything annoying about it… Though a 5 star rating is a good sign.</p>
<p>Sound card is usually integrated with the motherboard. If the case has a front output for headphones, you’ll be able to simply plug something from your motherboard to the case that will feed the sound in there, no need for a sound card.</p>
<p>GPU is the graphics card, yes (Graphics Processing Unit)<br>
That’s the one I currently have:<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133326" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133326</a><br>
It’s half the price of the one you linked, and it does a good job.</p>
<p>I would have used the edit button… but notice there’s like 30 minutes between the 2 posts. Someone could have easily posted in the meantime  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind: If you ever plan to have 2 graphics card in SLI, you need a motherboard with 2 PCI-Express 2.0 slots. The one I linked only has 1. But if you’re like me, by the time you’ll want to upgrade the graphics card, you’ll be better off buying a new better one instead of adding a 2nd similar card.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Let’s see:<br>
Motherboard 105$ <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128490" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128490</a><br>
CPU 99$ (quad-core) <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103921" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103921</a><br>
Beastly power supply 95$ with rebates <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139006" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139006</a><br>
Same case I have 45$ <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811154098" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811154098</a><br>
4GB RAM 46$ <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231193" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231193</a><br>

<p>That totals around 470$ if I count right… +taxes… +a GPU<br>
And that power supply is probably way too much, just didn’t find anything that was a bit under that in my quick search.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>My rig was built with approximately the same budget…</p>
<p>I built it over a couple of weeks though, waiting for good Shell Shocker deals on Newegg. It looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103851" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Phenom II X6 CPU 1055T</a> Cost me 212$… They’re much cheaper now, the 1090T is 190$.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811154098" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Vortex Mid tower case</a> 32$. I had 2 criterias: Cheap, and fans included  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139005" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Power supply CORSAIR Enthusiast Series CMPSU-650TX 650W</a> Cost me 95$, it was a nice deal at the time. You can find excellent power supplies in the 80-100$ price range IMO. I saw a modular one of 550W or something at ~60$ on Newegg the other day… What you need to check mainly is the output capacity of the +12V rail… This one had 52A, which was the highest I’ve seen in that price/wattage/quality range.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130236" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This motherboard</a> (113$) and <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130236" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this RAM</a> (99$) in a combo deal with 20$ discount. That RAM is 45$ now, so you can certainly get something better and/or cheaper</p>
<p>Standard DVD Burner 20$… Unless you have particular needs, don’t spend more than that.</p>
<p>Hard drive: You can get a 1TB drive for 70$ easily. I later upgraded with a SSD, which is awesome, but it won’t fit your budget  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>At the time I didn’t need a GPU as the one in my previous machine was still fine… But you can spend anywhere between 50 to 300 for that alone, so I’ll leave that up to you  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>These prices I listed don’t include about 80$ of mail-in rebates total. Also, these are from newegg.CA… so if you’re in the US, prices tend to be lower (even though the canadian dollar is worth more than the USD at the moment… go figure…) This was all bought less than 1 year ago.</p>
<p>My regrets:<br>
-The case is not that bad, but it’s really tight behind the drive slots, so it’s not easy to push in / pull out drives in there.<br>
-Not getting a motherboard with USB 3.0, but at the time they were pretty expensive… You can now probably find one that fits your budget. Not that there are many usb 3.0 devices now, but it would make your machine a bit more future-proof.</p>
