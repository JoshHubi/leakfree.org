    <title>Start of apprehension.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/start-of-apprehension/11324</link>
    <description>At the start of apprehension after you drop down to the trams there is an area where you can get stuck in the map and cannot get out.

It is a gap off the side of one of the trams sorry no picture of it but there is a map problem in the area at the bottom with all the trams.</description>
