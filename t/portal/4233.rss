    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portal/4233</link>
    <description>How does Portal fit into the Half-Life series? Exactly when relative to half-life, do the events from portal occur? Also, why, if they are close competitors, does Aperture&#39;s research facility look so much nicer and more advanced than Blackmesa&#39;s? And, in Portal, what happened to all the people? There are tons of chairs and desks and observation rooms, even a running powerpoint presentation, but not a single scientist. What happened to them? 

Thanks to anyone who answers. Also, are there any official answers from Valve, or is it all just speculation?</description>

            <p>I have always taken that Portal 1 was set right around the time of the 7-hour war or perhaps right after Freeman destroys the Nihilanth (for example, during your battle with GLaDOS, she says, “I have an infinite capacity for knowledge, and even I’m not sure what’s going on outside”.)</p>
<p>Portal 2 happens further in the future, probably even after the events of Half-Life 3 (depending on what Valve decides to do, timeline-wise) as evidenced by Chell’s overgrown potato-battery.</p>
<p>All this is supposition, of course, but Valve has not (and might not ever) connect Chell’s storyline with Gordon’s.  The closest they’ve gotten so far is to mention that an Aperture Science ship disappeared from drydock sometime before Episode 2 and was found during the events of Ep2 (about 20 years after HL1 so about the year 202x).</p>

            <p>I’m not sure if Portal 2 does take place centuries afterwards. People said so before it came out, but there isn’t really any way of telling in the game itself. It could be centuries, it could be a mere decade or two. Valve were pretty good at leaving it open.</p>

            <p>This Thread.   Joy.</p>
<p>Anyways, from what I believe, I think Half-Life is set in the Late 1990’s, with Portal’s Setting taking place during or after the 7 Hour War.</p>
<p>The Half-Life 2 Series takes place roughly 15-20 years after the Events in Half-Life, And Portal 2 takes place an undetermined number of centuries after That.</p>

            <p>People have probably allready posted this, but it’s fun to express your knowledge. Half-Life 1 is set at 200x, through me 2000, which sets Portal in 2010 and Half-Life 2 in 2020. Portal 2?? No idea, probably after HL3.</p>

<p>The Masses are out there, seething in their own self diluted pool of ignorance and decay, festering away at this planets resources, without purpose, and without mind. Their Purpose is to be contained and used, what little functioning remains of their cortex they may posses  are negligable, Leaving only the Brute and Mindless, disgusting Body.</p>
<p>We can Control them. We can enslave them. With that Power, we can eradicate all putrid life that stands in our way.<br>

<p>From what we can gather, someone tried to kill everyone in the building by using the neurotoxin vents. GLaDOS, seeing that person as a threat but unable to track him down, activates the emitters herself in order to kill him (and everyone else) before he kills everyone. In death, one of the scientists activates the -as-yet-uncompleted morality core. I guess the party escorts cleaned up the bodies, aside from a few grease stains here and there.</p>
<p>But yeah, it’s just speculation.</p>

<p>Portal is in the Half-Life universe. That’s a fact. They’ve just decided not to elaborate much on the connection in Portal 2, as the styles of the two games differ somewhat.</p>

            <p>Well it was confirmed that portal has no connection to the Half-Life universe…<br>
The developers (if you seen the developers notes in portal) said that they used props and textures from EP:2 because they didn’t had any more resources…<br>
They also mentioned that Portal 2 will happen 3000 years after the ending of the Half-Life saga…</p>

            <p>^This basically. This line basically tells you:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="GLaDoS">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 GLaDoS:</div>

<p>What is your point anyway? Survival? Well then, the last thing you want to do is hurt me. I have an infinite capacity for knowledge, and even I’m not sure what’s going on out there.</p>

<p>And this one from the ending credits:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Still Alive">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Still Alive:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>When I look out there it makes me GLaD I’m not you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes place during the time when the Combine are securing a foothold on Earth.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually it doesn’t. It just occured to me that Portal could just as easily be taking place during/slightly after the RC. Which would explain the utter lack of scientists.</p>

            <p>The neurotoxin isn’t the reason why the facility is abandoned. There still had to be people around to insert the morality core, remember? It’s more likely that they ran off during the Seven Hour War, which was presumably shortly after that. I think it’s possible Judith Mossman used to work at Aperture Science, considering she knows where the Borealis is.</p>
<p>Portal probably occurs at some point between the Combine taking control of Earth and Gordon waking up. Any earlier than that and there would have been an investigation. And the Aperture facility probably looks more advanced because they put more score in aesthetics than Black Mesa, and also don’t put ethics before results.</p>
