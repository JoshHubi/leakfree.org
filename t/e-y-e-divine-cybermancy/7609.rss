            <p>Buy it if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you got at least half a brain,</li>
<li>you like Deus Ex,</li>
<li>you actually liked S.T.A.L.K.E.R when it came out.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact it’s the poor man’s S.T.A.L.K.E.R with less atmosphere and more Deus Ex, meaning that it’s choke-full of bugs and terrible design decisions but it’s a fantastic enabler, allowing you to approach each situation in a myriad of ways and RPG-stat your character <span class="bbcode-i">to the extreme</span>.</p>
<p>The shooting ain’t bad at all, but it’s countered by the terrible AI. The visual design is extremely derivative and all over the place, but it does look good, sort of impressive, and sometimes pretty original. Once again it’s countered by the contrast and color correction (most of the time you can’t see a thing), also if intricate stories are your thing you might want to give this one a pass. The save system is also awful (there’s no quick-save) and you’ll encounter a few game breaking bugs. A patch is coming out soon to sort some of them.</p>
<p>Also when you can get it to work it’s got great co-op.</p>
