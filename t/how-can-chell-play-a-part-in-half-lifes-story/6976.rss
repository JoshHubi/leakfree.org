            <p>Yeah, I always thought that Portal was after the Combine invasion. But, how could Rattmann survive there for… at least 20 years? It’s implausible but possible.</p>

            <p>Hi all, im new here.</p>
<p>So I wanna add a few things.</p>
<p>Lets say that portal 2 is no more than 50-60 years into the future after it all went to hell. The fecillity is powered by a nuclear reactor and if there is no one to look after it (glados is down) it shouldn’t last much long. This is like some evidence that portal 2 is not 9 or 9999 years into the future. Also, glados mentions the combine invasion when Chell is about to destroy her :</p>
<p>“Things have changed since the last time you left the building. What’s going on out there will make you wish you were back in here.” - scary aliens<br>
“I have an infinite capacity for knowledge, and even I’m not sure what’s going on outside.”<br>
“All I know is I’m the only thing standing between us and them. Well, I was.”<br>
“Unless you have a plan for building some supercomputer parts in a big hurry, this place isn’t going to be safe much longer.”</p>
<p>And at the end of portal 2, Chell reaches the surface and there we see great blue sky, white clouds, vast vegetation, Birds - no sign of the combine. Yes, there was vegetation in Half Life 2, but since Portal 2 is some years later, its supposed that the combine/xen could’ve turned our wolrd into barren land. And this only proves that Gordon puts an end to the combine - happy ending of ep3  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  a spoiler of some sort.</p>
<p>He wont meet Chell directly. In an early post i read he may observe her on a monitor/screen of some sort, which si very halflifefish. And what will he find in Borealis? Well a teleport to a portal to the distant past, maybe stopping himself from f*cking up in Black Mesa, or going to the Combine capital in some other dimention and there he will kick their leader’s mech-ass.</p>
<p>k, eat me</p>

<p>Exactly!<br>
Same with canonity, something can be non-canon now and become canon later on, so there is indeed no point in discussing.</p>

            <p>Oh please, it’s just the pre-recorded messages that lagged, that many plants doesn’t find their way that far down underground in just nine years… Half-Life 2 isn’t set in the future, huh? Yeah, read the Combine OverWiki, it’s set in 2020. Portal 1 is set at 2010 and god knows when Portal 2 is set.</p>

<p>Not sure where you’re getting this “nine years” figure. Actually, I am pretty sure. Your rectum. On top of that, “nine years” would hardly be considered a long time by anyone’s definition (unless your twelve years old, I guess. That explains it…).</p>
<p>Also, isn’t it widely accepted that Half-Life takes place in 200X? Shut up, dude.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Portal 2 events happened NINE years after original portal, and the original portal could have happened any number of years after 1992 (which I think was the point in which glados killed every one it was definitely before half life one) and the black mesa incident was supposed to have occurred in 1994 or 5 I believe, all according to the Portal 2 team at valve when they were hyping up the release of portal 2 talking about Apeture’s history.  Half life 2 takes place 20 years after half life one (2008?) and it is possible that chell survived up to that point. Portal 2 does not, and has never been stated or hinted to have taken HUNDREDS of years. Stop spreading this nonsense.</p>
<p>if you didn’t know, though I doubt it, neither half life or half life 2 were supposed to take place in the future.</p>

<p>Of course he was, but he fought his way through Aliens and military, he killed thousands of men, women and creatures without dieing. Chell destroyed a mad computer, big deal. All she had to do was to throw its cores into a fire, avoiding getting choked by neurotoxin. Chell has never showed any skills in handling any other gun then a portalgun.</p>

            <p>Uhm… How would a mute lunatic that’s escaped from a research facility lead by a robot, completley deserted, with a portalgun and an idiot be any help to G-Man?P And how could she help Gordon if she can’t talk? Of course she can, but she never does. neither does Gordon.</p>
<p>I think that all this is because you guys want a coop mode in HL3, one playing as chell and one as Gordon, but that will never happen. At least not with Chell. Maybe with Gordon and Barney, or Gordon and Alyx.</p>
