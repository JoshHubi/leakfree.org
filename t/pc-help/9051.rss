    <description>So this morning i used my PC normally, no sign of any trouble
Then later i booted it up again, however the monitor doesn&#39;t seem to connect with my PC
I checked all the cables, and tried a different monitor, tried a different cable and still no luck, i also noticed that windows doesn&#39;t seem to startup (usually i would hear the startup music, but there was none)

I checked the internet for some solutions, tried some but still no luck
So you guys have any idea what&#39;s wrong &amp; how to fix it? Or i&#39;ll just take it to a technician?</description>

            <p>There could be a possibility that it IS your motherboard <span class="bbcode-b">battery</span>. It’s more likely to be a dead board (if you are indeed getting no beeps), but mb batteries are dirt cheap and I would start there. I have had this happen to me once… I think that with some MBs, no battery = no PC.</p>

            <p>Does the monitor say “no signal” or is it simply blank (black)?<br>
Also, try connecting to the onboard GPU if you have one.<br>
Also, does the PC beep when you turn it on?<br>
Also, clear the CMOS (remove the battery).</p>
