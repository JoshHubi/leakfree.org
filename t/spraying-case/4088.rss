    <title>Spraying case.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/spraying-case/4088</link>
    <description>Hi guys and gals, just wanting to know the best way to accomplish this, i have an Antec 300 which i wish to spray black on the interior of the case, considering its made of STEEL can anyone reccomend any sprays to use on it, and wether i should just clean the inside of the case remove all dust etc, and give it light coats every couple of hours. just wandering the best way to go about this.

Thanks.  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

            <p>Use car paint. Comes in a variety of colours and it’ll go straight on. No sanding needed. I’ve used it on bare metal, existing paintwork and filler, no problems. You can pick it up down your local Halfords/Kevin Coopers/etc etc (I’m assuming you’re from the UK  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) for a couple of quid</p>
<p>Because its black you shouldn’t have to worry about a decent finish, especially if it’s inside. But shake the can very thoroughly, read the label, wear a facemask and try and use one even motion to apply it</p>

            <p>IMHO, if you have the option you should always sand and prime any surface you want to paint.</p>
<p>When it comes to painting the interior of your Antec 300, I would say to take off/out everything you possibly can (front bezel, both side panels, HDD cage, etc) then uniformly sand the interior surfaces with 320-600 grit wet-dry sandpaper.  Once all surfaces have been sanded, apply Rustoleum primer, then pick your style of paint (matte, satin, glossy) in Rustoleum Enamel (enamel is generally what you want for metal surfaces, Rustoleum is just a good name).</p>
<p>Your best tools in this project will be time and patience with the sanding and taking time between coats, unless you just want the interior to be black and care less for quality  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>They make stuff called DTM (direct to metal). We use it in the business to paint metal handrails, and stairs. So the shit sticks even in places with lots of wear. (years of oil and abrasion from hands is hard on paint epically on handrails) But almost any hard paint (enamel) should work if you prepair it properly, sanding priming.</p>
