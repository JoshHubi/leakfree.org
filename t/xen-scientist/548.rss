    <description>I figured this would be the best place to come and ask about this.  It&#39;s been bothering me ever since I found it years ago.  When fighting the Nihilanth it transports you to different sections of Xen, one having water underneath, a few Vortigaunts and a Gargantuan.  If you use the jump pads, you can throw yourself up onto a ledge high up on the wall where there is sat a scientist without an HEV suit.

Never have I found any explanation as to why he is there, whether it&#39;s just a little easter egg joke or just an anomaly.  I wondered if perhaps anyone could shed some light on it for me.  :slight_smile:

            <p>Inb4lock (I finally get to say that!!!) like somebody said in the youtube comments:<br>
“<span class="bbcode-i">That scientist is the unltimate badass when you think about it.<br>
He fought all the way through the Black Mesa Dead Zone to the teleporters and went all the way throught Xen without even an HEV suit (The guys WITH HEV suits didn’t even﻿ make it that far). He trumped the giant headcrab full of mini headcrabs, and he fought Nihilanth TWICE and got teleported by him TWICE (because this is Gordon’s second teleport by him too), survived numerous long falls, and nearly defeated the ultimate evil.</span>”<br>

            <p>Look at the date of the post before yours. Also, the misspelling of Gordon’s name in your name isn’t usually tolerated around here, and I assumed you were a troll because of it. If both of those were genuine mistakes, than don’t make them again.</p>

<p>Xen has air, there’s a living sci there. How many times?</p>

</aside>
<p>Over…nine…thousand? Please don’t ban me… :fffuuu:</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p>Dr. Peterson was having a bad day, not to say it wasn’t an unusual thing. Life at Black Mesa could be quite trying for anyone, who wouldn’t feel the strain of living and working somewhere that could blow up at any second… As he contemplated his new theorem (That which concludes on how underpants sometimes form wedgies on their own) he stepped through the main door to one of the smaller Anomalous Materials labs.</p>
<p>“Good morning Ryan” came a friendly greeting from a fellow scientist, Dr. Oppenheim.<br>
“Good morning Heinrich” Robertson replied<br>
“I hear Freeman is late again…” Oppenheim sighed as he poured himself another cup of coffee.<br>
“Yes,” Robertson replied “I saw him on my way in, he tried to talk but I just reminded him he was late and he should talk to me AFTER the test”<br>
“Hah good old Gordon, anyway, how is your theorem coming along?” queried Oppenheim.<br>
“Oh well you know, the other day I finally concluded that particular types of stitching can ofte-”</p>
<p>Robertson was cut short as a huge tremor rocked the facility. Books, Computers and filing cabinets flew about, almost with minds of their own and the very walls of the room creaked and moaned. Finally, the lights flickered for a few moments before finally shutting off, leaving the two men shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>“Dear god!” exclaimed Oppenheim as the tremor finally subsided, “What was that?!”<br>
Robertson got to his feet and thought about the situation “I hope nothing went wrong with the test, I heard they were playing around with some experimental crystals today!”<br>
“Anyway” Robertson concluded, “We have to find our colleagues and learn more about the situation”</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard screams from outside the room, in the corridor. They rushed outside to find a fellow scientist running for his life from what looked like… a plucked turkey… with teeth? Robertson and Oppenheim decided that whatever their workmate was running from, they should do the same.  As they ran along the corridor to the nearest Transit System station they surveyed the damage, collapsed ceiling here, gaping hole in wall there.</p>
<p>Eventually they arrived at the station, there was a Tram already at the station, filled with their Colleagues.</p>
<p>“Oppenhieim, Robertson!, quickly get on board” a familiar voice beckoned them.<br>
“You go first” Robertson assured Oppenheim, referring to the now extremely precarious looking bridge that extended from the station to the Tram.<br>
“Very well, see you on the other side”. Oppenheim said in a shaky voice as he began his journey</p>
<p>Oppenheim made it to just about halfway when a second, larger tremor shook the platform. The bridge crumbled apart, leaving only enough support to keep the section Oppenheim was on to remain standing, but now, there was no way he could proceed to the Tram or back to the Station. The Tram began to take off, on an automatic timer. But almost as soon as it took off, the rail above it on the ceiling began to give way. Collective screams came from the Tram itself as it slowed down, began to shake and eventually plummet down into the dark abyss below…</p>
<p>“No…” Robertson sighed under his own breath, they would be trapped here, with no way of escape. Robertson took a few seconds to gather himself, then turned to Oppenheim and yelled across the now-decrepit bridge.</p>
<p>“Wait there, I’ll be back soon to try to find some he-” For the second time this day, Robertson was cut off by a loud buzz, all he could see was a flash of green light, and then darkness…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">And that explains how a scientist was placed in that particular location in Half-Life. Also the guy on the Tram Bridge who falls…</span></p>

            <p>so gordon wears a helmet, and thats why alyx finds him atractive?<br>
I guess gordon wears a HELLO MY NAME IS <span class="bbcode-u">gordon freeman</span> tag so that all the scientists can recognise him at a glance.</p>
<p>also I would suppose that gordon wore his helmet on the tram (and train in half life 2) so that he would have it when he put on the unhelmeted suit later.</p>

            <p>nonsense - it’s very plain to see from the design of the hev helmet that it simply cannot allow for bleeding and “major lacerations” resulting from blows to the head, unless it were punctured, in which case the wearer would be equally susceptible to the radiation and poison and therefore does not <span class="bbcode-i">require</span> the helmet to survive. And once this requirement is removed, there is no longer any reason <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> to assume that the artwork and models depict the actual character.</p>

<p>Besides, out of two the two alternatives being either:<br>
A.) That gordon is depicted throughout the games without a helmet for artistic license and for character recognition and in fact does wear a helmet normally.<br>
or:<br>
B.) He has a head made of titanium or something, and isn’t human, and can withstand radiation, lava, toxic waste, flame and a whole variety of things noone else can live through within the game world.</p>

<p>Humans can breathe on Xen. That scientist proves it. Blue Shift and Opposing Force just add icing on the cake.</p>

<p>Gordon wears a helmet. Must be so, or else he would’nt survive. The hazard suit we wears is for withstanding extreme radiation and poison levels, as well as direct hits from solid objects. They wouldn`t even let him into the test chamber without his helmet. The Sector C scientists might have been doing sloppy work all day long, but not THAT sloppy. Safety standards were still to be considered. In Episode I, Gordon’s head would get cooked if he wore no helmet. Entering the citadel core with deadly levels of radiation all around, he would be dead in a matter of moments.<br>
Yes, the Gordon multiplayer model is not wearing a helmet, and yes, no artwork ever shows him wearing a helmet. This is because the artwork is not to show you some anonymous guy, but a face to be recognized. Often artworks show Gordon only with a crowbar, despite him having a full arsenal available in the game. Along with a lifesaving helmet. Period.<br>
And yes, the model of the hazard suit in the locker room does not include a helmet. Still, Gordon without helmet would not survive the game. He would die of radiation or poisoning.</p>

<p>Do women shave or wax in half life? and back on topic, the scientist probably ended  up in the cavern after being teleported to xen, and having no weapons, he hid in a really out of the way place so as to survive, figuring that, eventually the armed forces would come to the rescue. at least thats all I can infer after the fact about something that really had no story when it was created.</p>
