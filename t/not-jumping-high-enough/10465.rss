    <title>Not jumping high enough (?)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/not-jumping-high-enough/10465</link>
    <description>Hi, great game from the past! Congrats!

I&#39;m having lot&#39;s of trouble jumping on top of things. It seems I cannot jump high enough. Can&#39;t climb on top of anything the same height (or bigger) than the metal barrels (horizontally).

It seems like a bug of some kind (?) or a bad game instalation (?) because I&#39;ve seen walkthrough videos and they all jump very easy on top the very same things, and for me it&#39;s impossible. So I&#39;m stuck in the game. :&#39;(

Help!
Thanks.</description>

            <p>Yeah, I completely forgot about the “special” jump with crouch (control). Damn!<br>

            <p>Are you hitting Crouch, which is bound to left ctrl for me, after jumping?</p>
