    <title>Can&#39;t load second map on &#39;Inbound&#39;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-load-second-map-on-inbound/10405</link>
    <description>Literally after the first loading screen of Inbound, I am transported into the walls of the canyon and cannot move, making playing the game impossible.

No idea what&#39;s causing it as the game doesn&#39;t crash or do anything at all. If there&#39;s no solution, is there a way of loading the Anomalous Materials map? I can&#39;t get the developer console up either.  

Haven&#39;t seen this anywhere else, please point me there if there&#39;s already a topic.</description>

            <p>Strange, I have no issue, and I’m running Windows 7 [with steam installed to default directory].  Are you sure that the file that the mod was in was called “BMS”, as in /sourcemods/BMS/?</p>

            <p>Solution found: Reinstall Steam to something other than the default Program Files folder on Windows 7, preferably “Games”. BMS is unable to pull the player.save files due to Windows 7’s various security issues.</p>
<p>You should be good to go after that.</p>

            <p>Huh, that’s odd. Mine’s definitely installed to SourceMods.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing round with the dev console and figured the problem but not the solution. Every time the map changes it gets rid of the player, which means I haven’t been able to save/load games either. The only way I’ve been able to advance through the game is by loading each chapter which often spawns the player with nothing.</p>
<p>Any others having similar issues? Would be hugely grateful for a solution</p>

<p>I had this issue as well, but then I realized that Black Mesa had been installed to a folder outside of my Steam directory (likely because my Steam directory is on my D drive). Once I moved the BMS folder to \Steam\steamapps\sourcemods, the issue no longer occurred.</p>
