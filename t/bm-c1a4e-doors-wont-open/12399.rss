    <description>Hi
I am in c1a4e (as named in the save logs) and am stuck.  I haven&#39;t played Half-Life 1 for long time and have forgotten the name of the level, sorry!

So I killed the three tentical creature and went down into the pool of water, swam down then up to a ledge and came to a room with a fast running radiation river.  There is a spinning gear in the acid water in the middle of the room.  I have explored the room and found 5 doors in total and NONE of them will open!:[

When I try to activate the doors nothing happens and therefore I cannot proceed.  I can jump everywhere fine and am not having any trouble reaching places, it&#39;s just the doors won&#39;t open!  I can&#39;t solve the puzzle behind this.  

Am I missing something or is this a glitch?  I would be very greatful for any help!</description>
