    <title>[SOLVED] PLEASE HELP! Nonstop crashing with multiple mods installed and an ENB</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/solved-please-help-nonstop-crashing-with-multiple-mods-installed-and-an-enb/13395</link>
    <description>:&#39;( I&#39;m so fed up with this. Honestly. I&#39;ve pulled hair out, broken several objects and nearly cut my finger open out of frustration at this point. All I want is for my brother to be able to play through Black Mesa, which I&#39;ve heavily modded to make it even more awesome, and enjoy it. But he can&#39;t. The game crashes. ALL THE TIME. At both specific AND RANDOM POINTS. With MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRASH MESSAGES. And I&#39;m desperate. [b]I know it may be a lot to take in, but I need all the help I can get. Don&#39;t dismiss this. Even if you think you can barely help at all, even if you think you&#39;ll only help a little, it will help and that&#39;s all that matters.[/b] Please.

Here is a list of the mods I have installed (keep in mind that many of these shouldn&#39;t be causing problems at all):

-Several weapon/character reskins and re-models.
-Animation overhaul which has gotten slightly overwritten by other custom skins.
-The join-ops pack which I use to make the HECU grunts have 3 different random skin variations.
-Surface Tension Uncut.
-On a Rail Uncut.
-The Loop Mod and Vent mods which add small content to the beginning of On a Rail and end of We&#39;ve Got Hostiles.
-The Black Mesa ENB, installed to the Source Base 2007 folder which adds lighting effects.
-Tons of custom decal, particle, muzzleflash ect. skins from gamebanana that shouldn&#39;t effect performance at all.
-Tons of custom sounds, and several changed scripted voiceover sounds which I&#39;ve edited myself that change the Apprehension ambush scene, Resonance Cascade scene and the satchel charge pipe ambush scene in ST Uncut.

Here&#39;s my custom autoexec file. When I first started playing, I didn&#39;t use an autoexec. Now, if I remove it, the game crashes on startup constantly. It should be helping me (by allocating more RAM, ect.) but [u]it seems to be the heart of my problems.[/u]

exec config.cfg
//exec threading.cfg

alias &quot;+realwalk&quot; &quot;cl_forwardspeed 82&quot;
alias &quot;-realwalk&quot; &quot;cl_forwardspeed 320&quot;
bind &quot;CTRL&quot; &quot;+realwalk&quot;

datacachesize 256
mem_min_heapsize 48
mem_max_heapsize 256
mem_max_heapsize_dedicated 64
sv_forcepreload 1
cl_forcepreload 0
fps_max 300
snd_mix_async 1
snd_async_fullyasync 1
mat_queue_mode -1
host_thread_mode 0
save_history_count 3
r_threaded_particles 1
r_threaded_renderables 0

Additionally, I can upload my crash logs if needed. I would try to open up and analyze them myself, but I could never download Visual Studio. I seriously fucking hate Microsoft.

Here is a sample of some of the fixes I&#39;ve tried:

-Allocating more RAM, both via launch command and by autoexec commands (I have 32 gb of ram, so I have plenty to spare).
-Running the game windowed.
-All of the fixes described here: [url]https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2948510[/url]
-Turning on/off and combining all of the performance related commands listed in my autoexec several times.
-Removing the ENB.
-Removing and re-creating my config.cfg file.
-Biting my fingers until they bleed and screaming.
-Crying.
-Allocating different amounts of RAM.
-Trying to avoid specific crashes.
-Messing with in-game graphics settings.
-Restarting my computer and sleeping the stress off.
-Messing with allocating more cores.
-Using the recommended settings from the Cinematic Mod, because it is also intensive.
-Turning audio quality down, rebuilding soundcache and reducing audio quality via commands.
-Changing back to stock weapons (including their models, materials, sounds, particle effects and associated scripts at once).
-Several others, but I&#39;m still open to any recommendations.

On my first playthrough of the game (with no added mods) I was able to play through the entire thing at max settings with only one crash (at the Surface Tension dam, where crashing is common) at 60 fps. But here are my specs anyway:

Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4800MQ CPU @ 2.70GHz
Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770M
Memory: 32 GB
And operating system: Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate Edition Service Pack 1 (build 7601), 64-bit

PLEASE HELP IF YOU CAN! I&#39;M BEGGING YOU! Not only would it mean a lot to me, it would mean a lot to my brother. He&#39;s always been a Call of Duty player, and has made fun of Half-Life for a while now. So I finally got him to play it, and just as he started getting into it, all this bullshit began. Please help. I&#39;ll keep bumping this until I make some progress. Thanks in advance from the bottom of my heart. -Lockjaw</description>

            <p>I had the exact same problem, on the basis of trial and error I discovered that WHAT was causing the crash was the Reanimation Pack.  I uninstalled the Reanimation Pack and all crashes disappeared.</p>
<p>But just do not feel very happy about it, I loved the Reanimation Pack, much better than the original weapons, if anyone knows how to solve the problem and make the Reanimation Pack work without any crash please tell.</p>

            <p>THANK GOD! Tonight, I FINALLY got BMS to work once more! I never thought I would be able to fix it this fast, but it seems like I have! The solution was a combination of two things: first off, PCGameCrazy’s idea of reverting back to the stock weapons WAS actually the key. So huge props to him for suggesting that and providing the backup download. Additionally, sersoft’s idea of setting the heapsize to 1024000 was what (in combination with the stock weapons) finished off the problem. What was weird is that I had brought my heapsize up like that while using stock weapons at another point, but it seems that EXACT AMOUNT of memory to allocate fixed it up. So MASSIVE props to everyone for saving me another meltdown! After some testing, the only crashes I get now are from memory allocation errors, which are rarer and less pesky by FAR. My brother and I can both actually continue now, and that means I can continue my ultimate Half-Life pack which includes a polished Black Mesa, as well as a heavily changed Cinematic Mod (because we all know the Cinematic Mod is shit without heavy changes lol). As much as I miss the old reanimated weapon models, I’ve added in around 7 new skins ranging from arm reskins to weapon reskins and standalone reanimations which spice up the stock models as compensation for the loss. My sound pack also eases the pain of parting with the animation revamp. Still, I couldn’t have done it without you guys, so a huge thanks once more. I mean it. -Lockjaw</p>

            <p>First try mat_queue mode 0 1 or 2 and set max heapsize to 512000 or 1024000, if that doesn’t work, try again with no mods and then by trial and error try to eliminate the source of the source mod mod conflict. :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>Update: Changing the weapons back to default helped performance a bit overall, and I bypassed one crash I would get about 50% of the time a bit easier. However, in the end, the game is still extremely unstable and crashes just about as much. I greatly appreciate the help, but the problem is still very much at large. I’m going to add the stock weapons to the list of solutions I’ve tried in the OP, and will still search for a total solution. Leave more suggestions if possible!</p>

<p>Thanks for that edit. Going to test it tomorrow. Hopefully it will in-fact help, but I unfortunately doubt it based on what I’ve already had to go through. Still I appreciate the download, and the speedy reply was much appreciated!</p>

<p>Alright, I’ll definitely try removing it as a test, but in the long run, I believe the crashes are mostly tied to map loading/ram issues or something similar. Still, thanks for the recommendation. Definitely gonna test it out. More suggestions are welcome, however!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>:’( I’m so fed up with this. Honestly. I’ve pulled hair out, broken several objects and nearly cut my finger open out of frustration at this point. All I want is for my brother to be able to play through Black Mesa, which I’ve heavily modded to make it even more awesome, and enjoy it. But he can’t. The game crashes. ALL THE TIME. At both specific AND RANDOM POINTS. With MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRASH MESSAGES. And I’m desperate. <span class="bbcode-b">I know it may be a lot to take in, but I need all the help I can get. Don’t dismiss this. Even if you think you can barely help at all, even if you think you’ll only help a little, it will help and that’s all that matters.</span> Please.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the mods I have installed (keep in mind that many of these shouldn’t be causing problems at all):</p>
<p>-Several weapon/character reskins and re-models.<br>
-Animation overhaul which has gotten slightly overwritten by other custom skins.<br>
-The join-ops pack which I use to make the HECU grunts have 3 different random skin variations.<br>
-Surface Tension Uncut.<br>
-On a Rail Uncut.<br>
-The Loop Mod and Vent mods which add small content to the beginning of On a Rail and end of We’ve Got Hostiles.<br>
-The Black Mesa ENB, installed to the Source Base 2007 folder which adds lighting effects.<br>
-Tons of custom decal, particle, muzzleflash ect. skins from gamebanana that shouldn’t effect performance at all.<br>
-Tons of custom sounds, and several changed scripted voiceover sounds which I’ve edited myself that change the Apprehension ambush scene, Resonance Cascade scene and the satchel charge pipe ambush scene in ST Uncut.</p>
<p>Here’s my custom autoexec file. When I first started playing, I didn’t use an autoexec. Now, if I remove it, the game crashes on startup constantly. It should be helping me (by allocating more RAM, ect.) but <span class="bbcode-u">it seems to be the heart of my problems.</span></p>
<p>exec config.cfg<br>
//exec threading.cfg</p>
<p>alias “+realwalk” “cl_forwardspeed 82”<br>
alias “-realwalk” “cl_forwardspeed 320”<br>
bind “CTRL” “+realwalk”</p>
<p>datacachesize 256<br>
mem_min_heapsize 48<br>
mem_max_heapsize 256<br>
mem_max_heapsize_dedicated 64<br>
sv_forcepreload 1<br>
cl_forcepreload 0<br>
fps_max 300<br>
snd_mix_async 1<br>
snd_async_fullyasync 1<br>
mat_queue_mode -1<br>
host_thread_mode 0<br>
save_history_count 3<br>
r_threaded_particles 1<br>
r_threaded_renderables 0</p>
<p>Additionally, I can upload my crash logs if needed. I would try to open up and analyze them myself, but I could never download Visual Studio. I seriously fucking hate Microsoft.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of some of the fixes I’ve tried:</p>
<p>-Allocating more RAM, both via launch command and by autoexec commands (I have 32 gb of ram, so I have plenty to spare).<br>
-Running the game windowed.<br>
-All of the fixes described here: <a href="https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2948510" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2948510</a><br>
-Turning on/off and combining all of the performance related commands listed in my autoexec several times.<br>
-Removing the ENB.<br>
-Removing and re-creating my config.cfg file.<br>
-Biting my fingers until they bleed and screaming.<br>
-Crying.<br>
-Allocating different amounts of RAM.<br>
-Trying to avoid specific crashes.<br>
-Messing with in-game graphics settings.<br>
-Restarting my computer and sleeping the stress off.<br>
-Messing with allocating more cores.<br>
-Using the recommended settings from the Cinematic Mod, because it is also intensive.<br>
-Turning audio quality down, rebuilding soundcache and reducing audio quality via commands.<br>
-Changing back to stock weapons (including their models, materials, sounds, particle effects and associated scripts at once).<br>
-Several others, but I’m still open to any recommendations.</p>
<p>On my first playthrough of the game (with no added mods) I was able to play through the entire thing at max settings with only one crash (at the Surface Tension dam, where crashing is common) at 60 fps. But here are my specs anyway:</p>
<p>Processor: Intel® Core™ i7-4800MQ CPU @ 2.70GHz<br>
Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770M<br>
Memory: 32 GB<br>
And operating system: Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate Edition Service Pack 1 (build 7601), 64-bit</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP IF YOU CAN! I’M BEGGING YOU! Not only would it mean a lot to me, it would mean a lot to my brother. He’s always been a Call of Duty player, and has made fun of Half-Life for a while now. So I finally got him to play it, and just as he started getting into it, all this bullshit began. Please help. I’ll keep bumping this until I make some progress. Thanks in advance from the bottom of my heart. -Lockjaw</p>
