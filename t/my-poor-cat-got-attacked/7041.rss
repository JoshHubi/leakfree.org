    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-poor-cat-got-attacked/7041</link>
    <description>2 days ago my cat was attacked by a neighbor&#39;s dog he bit her stomach and slit it wide open and he also ripped her right leg&#39;s muscles and tissues I took her to the vet and he managed to stitch the grievous wound but I still have to take her tomorrow for another operation, am still surprised how she managed to survive this deadly attack!!

<p>That’s a bad analogy. It’s more like saying a child living in an incredibly dangerous neighborhood should be moved by child services to a safer neighborhood.</p>

            <p>Not really, because the cat clearly wasn’t intentionally getting himself killed. It’s more like you like to go hiking a lot in the local mountains, but only a small part of those mountains are actually your property. You hike in them anyway and run into some overprotective assholes who shoot and kill you for trespassing.</p>

            <p>Isn’t it like the classic human proverb of fatherly wisdom that one should not seek revenge on an animal?</p>
<p>If the cat got into the dog’s yard and got himself fucked up, and then Shadi kills the dog personally/ has it impounded, that would be analogous to the following:</p>
<p>Boxing Champ: “I am dangerous.”<br>
Feeble Man: “Please don’t hurt me!”<br>
<em>Man grabs Boxing Champ’s fist and rams himself into it neck-first</em><br>
<em>Man presses charges</em></p>

</aside>
<p>Did shadi say that? For all we know the dog tore shadi’s fence and got his cat. I’m not saying that that’s the case, shadi hasn’t told us.</p>
<p>That’s pretty flawed logic. The neighbor’s property is the only territory that is the dog’s, but unfortunately the dog doesn’t understand property boundaries and all that human stuff, especially when he sees a cat. If the dog left his owner’s property and attacked shadi’s cat then the owners of the dog and the dog itself are infinitely more at fault than shadi and his cat. But if the cat wandered onto the neighbor’s yard it’s a completely different story. So which was it Shadi?</p>
<p>I’ve had a dog come onto our property through a crack in our huge fence and attack one of out chickens. If the owners weren’t so apologetic and I gave more of a shit about our chickens I would have been pissed as hell. The chicken somehow lived BTW. The dog tore open a fatty gash in it’s back and dragged it about a hundred feet. We gave it some food and some water and put it somewhere separate from the other chickens so it could die peacefully rather than being pecked to death. Now it’s completely healed and can’t even be told apart from the other chickens.</p>
<p>Also, Shadi, go to the pound and adopt an older cat that is accustomed to living inside.</p>

            <p>I agree with reporting the dog but still you kind of had it coming, I have never owned a cat and I only have a tortoise, but whenever I let him outside I keep a close eye on him because we have 2 dogs next door and 3 cats next door from the other house, and a dog has already gotten too close for comfort. Make sure you know when to take your pet out and bring them in, when you own a pet do your research on how to train it, sorry for your loss. I am posting this late at night so I have no idea how accurate I am so excuse me for any stupidity</p>

<p>funny how you talk about me being a shitty owner, it’s a fucking cat we’re talking about not a dog, cats don’t listen, cat’s don’t obey, you clearly don’t know how it feels when your cat keeps fucking meowing at 3:00AM like it’s being beaten just to go outside, I doubt you ever felt that. ever since I got this one I kept getting into arguments with my family for every fucking single day about not letting her out but they kept getting her outside without me knowing till she got used to it, and in the end I got sick of these arguments but oh wellz, I took her today to the vet for another opertaion and she’ll stay there for a week. hope she gets well soon.</p>

</aside>
<p>Cats obey if you train them.  My cat will sit, roll over and shake hands, like a dog.  When I first got him he was pretty persistent about going out too, but I trained him to stop.  It just takes dedication and hard work, but that is better than a dead cat.</p>

            <p>You can probably report the dog as a vicious pet that is dangerous to the public and the pound will come and put him down.</p>

<p>AFAIK 1st-degree murdering another person’s pet is a criminal act in most civilized places. Dunno about jail time, but there’s definitely lawsuits and fines involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>give your cats affection and teach them that they are not to go outside when they’re kittens and they’ll grow up to be loving, trusting, happy INDOOR cats.<br>
if you’re adopting, adopt a cat that’s used to being inside. it’s not hard.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There’s exceptions - as I mentioned, our cats have been strictly INDOOR cats since kittenhood - they’re about the same age, but from different litters.  The only times they had left the house was for vet checks and to get neutered.  One is content and actually a little afraid of what’s outside; whereas, the other has gotten out a couple times and shows a LOT of interest in being outside.  When he does manage to get out, the only way to get him back inside is to wait till he has to use the litter box <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

            <p>Sorry about your loss, i’ve lost a cat once too when i was a kid, her foot was flattened by a car  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>My street has a bunch of wandering animals that people feed every now and then, including a cat that’s half deaf, you can sneak up behind him and scare it to death, usually he’s either out in the sun, just chilling, or trying to find people that will feed it.<br>
The local house cats like to chase him too. Several times now the house cats would wait for somebody to drop off food so they could eat it before the stray one got back, you’d see him watching from a distance, hiding, waiting…</p>
