    <title>About G-Man being Gordon...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/about-g-man-being-gordon/8124</link>
    <description>If you state that G-Man is Gordon Freeman, then that meanbs that Gordon is just hallucinating everytime he sees him... Right? And since Eli and Alyx have also seen him, they&#39;re just a part of his hallucination too, right? And, since Kleiner, Magnusson, and obviously Breen and a lot of other scientists have talked to Eli, they&#39;re just a hallucination too, right??? So, if Breen is just a hallucination, that means that the one that hired him is too, and the one that hired Breen also hired every other personal in Black Mesa, therefor they too are hallucinations, and the whole Black Mesa was a hallkucination. So all of the aliens and the combine and the people who lived to see the seven hour war and the portalstorm are hallucinations too, and the whole world saw that, right? So that means that humanity is a hallucination. Right??? And if humanity was created by evolution, then evolution was also a hallucination, and evolution was created by the Big Bang, or whatever created the world, and then that means that the whole world is a hallucination. At least in the game... Or is it?
  Since neither Gordon, who must be a hallucination himself, or the rest of the world doesn&#39;t exist, and since Gordon was created by Valve, that means that Half-Life or Half-Life 2 or any of Valve&#39;s games never existed, which means that Valve doesn&#39;t exist either. And since all of us have played at least one of their games, we don&#39;t exist either. And because of that, all of our generations before us doesn&#39;t exist either! So you don&#39;t exist, reader, neither do I, or him, or her. This means that the real life evolution doesn&#39;t exist either, and that means that NOTHING EXISTS!!! EVERYTHING IS JUST A HALLUCINATION!!!

So, dear readers and noobs, do you guys still think that Gordon Freeman is G-Man? Or do you believe in the above? Your choice...</description>

<p>No no no, not the REAL government; I mean the secret alien shadow government that is working with his boss, specifically. As in, like, not Black Mesa, just his boss.</p>
<p>Actually, the idea that Gordon is a paranoid, delusional basket case gets more plausible all the time.</p>

<p>Why are people even still replying to Vampire?</p>
<p>He’s been on another thread claiming the combine were the forces in Xen.</p>
<p>In other words he has no idea wtf he is talking about, realises this and backtracks repeatedly in order to save face, he isn’t worth the mental capacity it takes to recognise his name.</p>

 The One Free Cake:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I like to think that all of the hallucination stuff is true, except the circumstances were that Gordon hit his head on a metal surface in what was actually a very minor meltdown in the Lambda Chamber and went a bit bonkers due to substantial brain damage, and has been running around smacking his coworkers with crowbars and stealing guns from security guards in an imaginary fight against aliens and the government who are secretly working with his boss.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, it’s a great ending, since it destroys every single theory that you could have made. It’s like… You open your eyes and look that everything has been just a dream and you’re in a stretcher in a hospital room, in front of you a group of medics trying to save you and to your right there’s a big window showing the blue sky and a group of birds flying across it… And then you think “Everything will be all right” and close the eyes again, dying, since catatonia kills you when you wake up.</p>
<p>Maybe you could wake up and see that G-man is in front of you, but he’s the medic or just a normal worker.</p>

            <p>Fine, whatever.</p>
<p>Anyways, if G-Man is Gordon then Gordon should be able to speak, he should be able to teleport without the help of Black Mesa, he should be able to stop time. He should have black hair. And most importantly, he should age.</p>

<p>Joe Freeman and The One Free Cake talked on topic</p>
<p>some gone off topic, some purely talked about gman and blackmesa.</p>
<p>EDIT: This’s my last reply to you. Gonna get back and study harder. I wanna be a relativistic quantum physicist like Gordon Freeman. You should do it too. I mean do something practically.</p>

            <p>Yes they were… Just because the picture of Gordon Freeman was cut from a picture of G-Man, they actually think that. If you would spend less time complaining about noobs and more time actually reading through the forums, you will find these thoeries.</p>
<p>And about the flaslight core, I didn’t claim that its flaslight was working like a car lamp, Frozen Cham did. Blame him.</p>

You are the one who’s being serious about theories about the littlest details in “brokened portal 2 cores flashlight”-stuff.</p>
<p>And still you wonder why people would think you were serious here. LOL!</p>
<p>And then it’s you, out of all people, who’s making a fool of people believing in the (prolly far-fetched according to you) theory of G-Man being Gordon.</p>

            <p>You guys actually thought that I was serious about this? I was just trying to make a fool of all the G-Man being Gordon believers. I guess I succeeded since you continued to discuss the matter…</p>
