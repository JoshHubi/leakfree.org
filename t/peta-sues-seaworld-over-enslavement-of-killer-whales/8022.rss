            <p>I do not agree with Danson’s many assertions, however I do feel that you guys are being a bit harsh to his point of view. Regardless of how obviously vegan he is being, his points seem thought out, and well researched, though as biased as they may be. He articulated his arguments with intelligence without resorting to childish insults, as many have already done.</p>
<p>However, I strongly disagree with the large majority of his assertions. For one, as a Christian, I believe humans were made in the image of God. Made specifically to worship Him. However, He gave us a Choice: to choose Him, or to follow our own path. That is what sets us apart from animals. We were given souls, with the choice between right or wrong, death or eternity.</p>
<p>We were originally designed to eat fruits and vegetables, but with the Fall, there came changes. Humanity has learned to adapt and survive on whatever resources made available to them. With a scarcity of plants bearing fruits or vegetables, meat became a reliable source of protein, as well as fat. It’s no secret as to why it became a popular means to feed oneself; it tastes good.</p>
<p>With that, I close by saying that I enjoy my meats, but I also feel that the animals that eventually die to support this wonderous lust, should not be mistreated. Honestly, a happier animal yields better tasting products.</p>

            <p>Humans are omnivorous. We eat everything and that includes tasty, juicy meat.</p>
<p>Vegetarions and vegans should just shut the fuck up already and keep nibbling on their fucking tree leaves.</p>

            <p>Guys, guys, guys.</p>
<p>I think that we should all pause for a moment and reflect on this. We’re arguing over food. Do you know how ridiculous that is? How immature and depraved can we get? There’s no point in this nonsense.</p>
<p>Especially since we all know that vegetables suck big giant hairy slimy sweaty horse balls and that meat-eating is the only guaranteed way of survival.</p>
<p>Go meat!</p>

            <p>hey guys</p>
<p>it’s actually pretty simple</p>
<p>whether or not people are “meant” to eat meat is completely irrelevant</p>
<p>people should eat meat as much as they want, <span class="bbcode-i">with respect for the quality of production, and everything that goes with it</span> (i.e. treatment of animals; ecological impact; lack of antibiotics, hormones, etc.)</p>
<p>effect on personal health is also irrelevant to anyone but yourself</p>
<p>being completely vegetarian or vegan just for the sake of it is, in my opinion, unreasonable<br>
you shouldn’t back away from eating meat unless it is produced with no respect for quality as described above (or for some other personal reason, of course)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If any of you actually bother to read into the data behind all this, research “reasons for vegetarianism” and related searches, and you will get to the right information.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Completely unbiased information, too, I bet.  I’m not going to disparage your claims: I know all about the “energy pyramid,” where about 1/10th of the energy of any given trophic level is transferred to the one above it upon consumption.  Grass grows, then cows eat the grass, receiving about 1/10th of the energy in it.  Humans eat the cows, receiving about 1/10th of the energy in the meat.  The rest is lost as waste heat in the inherent biochemical reactions.  The argument goes, “if humans would cut out the middleman and just eat the grass themselves, there would be ten times as much food to go around.”</p>
<p>Personally, though, I think that meat is delicious.  Also, the balance that you mentioned involves more effort upkeep than most people want to have to put into their food preparation… and if you do vegetarianism wrong, you start to get seriously ill.</p>

<p>there goes your credulity. Corn is a New World food.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/bulb.png?v=9" title=":bulb:" class="emoji" alt=":bulb:"></p>
<p>Anyway, evolution hasn’t come too far since the last Ice Age… You can’t seriously suggest the baking of <span class="bbcode-i">bread</span> as a reason humans aren’t good for eating meat. [COLOR=‘Black’]After all, sandwiches are incredible.</p>
<p>Did you know that mankind as we know it is able to hunt most animals not by force, but by patience?</p>
<p>Yes, we can track or trap animals using our smarts, but against larger game we can pursue them to exhaustion with a jogging pace. Most prey animals flee like their lives depend on it, you see, and will tire from multiple encounters with a persistent predator like us.</p>
<p>Fun fact:</p>
<ul>
<li>Males like women with wider hips, to assure easier birthing.</li>
<li>Females like men with narrower hips, who can run more efficiently (thus bring home more bacon*).<br>
These two opposing preferences balance out into the pelvises we have today.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is theorized that we had no problem running down Neanderthal competitors due to our narrower hips and more efficient stride.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interestingly, bringing home more food was the same motivation for our upright posture. It’s easier to carry food home when you free up your hands and arms. Admittedly, our diet was mostly vegetable at that point in evolution. Predatory influences came later.</li>
</ul>

<p>One can not form a rebuttal to an unbacked claim.</p>
<p>You continue to go on about ‘facts’ but make no attempt to reference them, when you are the only person so far to cite such an ‘opinion’.</p>
<p>When you provide a stable and logical statement, I will counter with my rebuttal, until then, the dribble you constantly spew out will be met with equal logic.</p>
<p>But clearly, the left hemisphere of your brain is overpowering your right hemisphere, as you fail to take in new infomation and create a revision of your logic. Whether is be because your stubborness to never give in when wrong, or that your brain lacks the strength to adequately process new information (see eating meat).</p>
<p>I await your standard QQ and complaints about my ‘insults’ furthermore.</p>

<p>If we go with that principle, stopping to herd cattle, swine, chickens and other animals is actually going to help, because the fertile land that is now used to provide space and food for them will then be free to plant vegetables and grain there, which takes much less resources to grow, and provides food for many more people at the same time. Creating a hamburger is an inefficient way of producing food. If any of you actually bother to read into the data behind all this, research “reasons for vegetarianism” and related searches, and you will get to the right information.</p>

            <p>“Believe that man, he’s doctor for god’s sake!”</p>
<p>Now, I agree with the doc here, but also the answer to that will be unfailingly “But we are better than them! Because of our superior standing we must protect them!”. But the problem that this argument entails is that, for some reason, we should protect them because we are different. We have morals. To which I can only reply that, yes, we do. Flimsy, variable morals. Some morals that have screwed over humans much more than animals.</p>
<p>The best we can do is simply be practical about it and just go with an universal principle of “getting the biggest benefit from our enviroment while preserving the most of it”. It’s clean and efficient, rather than force feeding your morals into other people (or calling them retards for not accepting your ideas). It’s been done before, to great success.</p>
<p>besides killing baby cows is wrong but if you dont eat meat at all you break out vaginas</p>

<p>Actually, it was the other way round. The Neanderthals died out because they lived a mainly carnivorous life. The Cro Magnon people (our ancestors) started to settle near Neanderthal territories, so meat became rare and harder to get during the everlasting winters of the Ice Age. Many of the Neanderthal tribes died of starvation, because they were not able to substitute their normal diet with food from plants, even during the warm periods. The Cro Magnon people, on the other hand, foraged for fruits and vegetables and corn, they were the first to bake bread and invent farming.</p>
<p>Also, even modern day scientific studies have discovered that meat is more difficult to digest for the human body than fruit and vegetable. Also, long-term diets made up mainly of components from dead animals have been proven to have a negative effect on a human being’s health, while strictly vegetarian or even vegan diets, <span class="bbcode-i">if followed strictly and carefully (!!!)</span>, meaning that a balanced diet is guaranteed and all necessary nutrition is provided (which is entirely possible without eating meat), has an  overall positive effect on human health and even the potential to lengthen a human being’s lifespan.</p>
<p>But what do I know? I am just an uneducated stupid retard, right? Although I daresay I have probably read more books on nutrition alone than Collision has ever even had a look at - not matter what genre - in his entire life.</p>
<p>But he’ll probably answer that books are stupid anyway and that I am a retard for reading so much and yadda yadda yadda whatever. I wonder whether he has to compensate for something by insulting other people’s intelligence.</p>

            <p>Basically it comes down to this;  Cows taste great when turned into a hamburger.<br>
This is scientific and theological PROOF that God wants  us to eat them.<br>
Shit doesn’t taste good and that is because God doesn’t want us to eat shit.</p>
<p>Sentient or sapient or whatever, they taste good and therefore are good to eat.<br>
You can’t argue with a lion about such things.  It simply thinks, “mmm…this man looks delicious, I shall eat him”.</p>
<p>On a scientific note, when the monkeys started eating meat they consumed all the nutrients and protein which you cannot get from eating dirt and fruit which then, over hundreds of thousands of years, caused their brains to develop and grow.<br>
This is why Vegans have smaller brains than the rest of us.  True story, I’m a scientist.</p>
