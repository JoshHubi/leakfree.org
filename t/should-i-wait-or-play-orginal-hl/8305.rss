    <title>Should I wait, or play orginal HL</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/should-i-wait-or-play-orginal-hl/8305</link>
    <description>Hay guys,
  Hero the deal, its been a few years sence Iv played threw the half-life game from front to back.  Iv been wanted to for a while but keep saying to my self, just keep waiting until black mesa comes out.  Thing is Iv been doing that for like 2 years....  So Is the mod almost done?  I would wait anuther few months but I have no idea, (like most people) where the mod is at rite now.  Is it almost ready to be released or what?  The twitter page has no been updated in over 700 days its seys.  No new screen shots on the home page.  No real good solid news of the game.  Nothing really from the creators.  I would just like someone whos works on the game to give some sort of helpful reply to this so I have some sort of idea to when it will be released and what not.  Thank alot

            <p>As someone who has played both the old and new, I think you should play the original, if nothing else, just so you can see how much extra work we did.</p>

            <p>To Op:  You gotta play the original.  I don’t know about everyone else but it’s what got me into playing video games.  It’s possibly the best game I’ve ever played, even 13 years later I havn’t played one that is more fun to me.</p>

<p>I’m waiting on BM in order to blitz through the entire HL series. It’s my strange way of sort of honoring my favorite videogame of all time by putting myself through this seemingly never ending wait that I feel will pay off…at least in terms of entertainment. My OCD may have something to do with it but either way, it’s going to be a memorable week in gaming for me once BM comes out.</p>

            <p>Late, but in response to the OP: it’s almost arbitrary to not play the original before playing Black Mesa. The mod will be great, yes, but nothing will ever recreate Half-Life to its truest form. The atmosphere and design is incredible, and there is nothing that will give you a feeling in the world of gaming like beating Half-Life for the first time. Nothing.</p>

            <p>Far Cry had good AI, but they could see a bit too far on higher difficulties. I remember I was so amazed that you could throw rocks and distract them, except if they were looking towards your hiding spot they could see the rock and they would know it was you :FFFUUU:</p>
<p>I know FEAR’s AI was scripted a lot, but I’m pretty sure the flanking maneuvers and stuff were tied in to what soldiers said at least somewhat. Like they made predefined areas where the AI could do those actions, the AI just had to be in the right situation to perform them.</p>

<p>I don’t think any AI is as smart as it seems to be, it’s just a case of how good your misdirection is.</p>

<p>True enough. I just remember reading (I could’ve sworn it was on BM 3 or so years ago), that in FEAR, if a soldier yelled, “Flank him!”, for instance, if you looked around and killed a guy who happened to be in your vicinity, the player would just think “Well, I got the guy who was going to flank me.” or, if an enemy was just wandering around and got to your side, the player would say “Holy shit, they’re actually working together!” even though it was just pure coincidence that the enemy was actually there. And if nobody at all showed up, they would think “I must’ve killed the soldiers being ordered to flank me.”</p>

            <p>Yeah, also, fluid and realistic motion always make AI look smarter. But that’s all about animation.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen any NPC in a game run backwards and fire realistically.<br>
One of the worst cases are the CPs in Half Life 2.</p>

<p>That’s good AI for you; It doesn’t have to actually be smart, just seem like it. If it feels and acts like you’d expect an actual human to, then it’s good. HL2’s Combine AI is pretty smart, but it just doesn’t <span class="bbcode-i">feel human</span>. (Okay, technically it shouldn’t, since Overwatch soldiers aren’t human anymore, but the example still works.)</p>

<p>Necromorphs in Dead Space do that all the time, though it’s extremely easy to tell when they are, so you can just shoot them on the ground and kill them.</p>

<p>The first Unreal had similar advances in AI like HL, it was the same year too. HL’s was smart because they actually acted like soldiers and flanked you and flushed you out and shit, but Unreal’s was smart because they actually acted like intelligent aliens. They would chase you down, avoid your shots, look for ways to get behind you without being seen, etc.</p>
<p>I remember one of my earlier playthroughs I came across one of the skaarj guys with low health and I ran all the way back looking for health, and that fucker chased me up an elevator and without me even knowing went a different path to find me. he jumped off the bridge above me in a room I found some ammo in and killed me.</p>

            <p>yet no body seems to be able to do any better - as far as i’ve encountered.<br>
the FEAR ai actually hid in cover properly, none of this i just hide here behind this glass panel and hang half my body out any way.<br>
loved how when you went into cover they’d move and you’d go to shoot the same place only for them to have flanked in a 5 second window.</p>
