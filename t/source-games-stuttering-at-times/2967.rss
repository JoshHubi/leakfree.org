    <title>Source Games &quot;Stuttering&quot; At Times</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-games-stuttering-at-times/2967</link>
    <description>This is a problem affecting all Source games I own, namely the Half Life 2 series, Portal, Team Fortress 2 (which uses the Half Life 2 engine, of course), and L4D2. Near the end of December I switched from Vista to Windows 7, which is when this problem began.

When I start the game, everything runs fine and incredibly smoothly. However, within 5-20 minutes, the problem starts happening. The FPS drops like a rock (to 2-3 FPS), the sound loops, and the game becomes unplayable for 10-20 seconds. Then it goes back to smooth normal playing for a minute or two, then stutters, then smooth, etc. I have the most up to date nVidia driver for the 9700M GT.

I&#39;ve tried lowering the graphical settings to the lowest. Doesn&#39;t help.

I&#39;ve tried disabling multicore. Doesn&#39;t help.

I&#39;ve tried disabling Vsync. Doesn&#39;t help.

I&#39;ve verified the game files and defragmented them. I&#39;ve told Norton 360 to ignore the appcache folder bit. I&#39;ve tried setting it on Low and High priority with the task manager. I&#39;ve tried manually setting the CPU affinity to either 0 or 1 with the task manager.

Nothing seems to work. Any help you might be able to offer would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>I have Windows 7 as well, and the same graphics card, too. Everything is fine with me.</p>
<p>Like Sersoft said, it could be that it’s overheating. I installed an extra fan on my PC when I was having these problems, and it seemed to have worked. Could be a number of things.</p>

            <p>Maybe you should try either upgrading or even downgrading your graphics drivers. I know that bioshock had a similar issue and downgrading my drivers fixed that and all other games were fine too.</p>
<p>Are you running x86(32bit) or 64bit?</p>

            <p>I tried disabling Norton 360 completely.  System screamed that it was unsafe, blah blah blah, but still got the issue.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of the issue: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLYQacYDt5Y" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLYQacYDt5Y</a></p>
<p>First 30 seconds is what it’s like during the stuttering, next minute is closer to “normal,” though I am still running FRAPS, so  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I’m not sure what causes this but something similar was happening to me in TF2 a few days ago. Try opening Task Manager and closing everything but steam, explorer and your AV (or disconnect from the internet and close your AV aswell) then try launching it, it may be something to do with random scans from your AV as I’ve certainly had that problem before.</p>
