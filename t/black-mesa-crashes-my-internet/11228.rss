    <description>Hi Guys, 

I&#39;ve been working my way through Black Mesa and enjoying the hell out of it. The problem is that when I launch the game it causes my internet to crash out. For example, the achievements don&#39;t work and my Team Speak/skype disconnects. I also can&#39;t use the in game browser. I&#39;ve forwarded the ports for steam on my router so I don&#39;t think that is the problem. Have you got any solutions? It annoying having to choose between playing the game or talking to my friends.

THANKS IN ADVANCE!!!</description>

            <p>Hi Guys. Thanks for the replies. Nerus I’m not using an intergrated NIC. I am on a wireless connection which come through a plug in wireless adapter. My original wireless card is poor and unreliable. I tried opening the ports again and deleting everything in my steam folder accept for the exe and the games folders. No luck. The problem seems to persist with all my source games and I can’t find a solution. I imagine its going to be as easy as changing one of the settings on my router. I have deleted my firewall program and made sure source is not blocked by windows defender. It seems strange that it would make my internet disconnect when the program starts. I also realised that if I minus out of the program my internet reconnects.</p>
<p>Seriously, any suggestions would be awesome!</p>

            <p>Sounds like all source games are affected, try to sign out of steam, delete C:\Program Files(x86)Steam\clientregistry.blob and any other blob files, then restart steam.</p>

            <p>I have problems when playing some other mods like NMRIH where the server browser doesn’t work and I can’t connect even if I look in the browser before the game. I was wondering what I could do to fix these problems. Have you got any ideas where to look for solutions?</p>

            <p>Does your internet work with other games? Because otherwise, it’s not a Black Mesa In-game bug</p>
