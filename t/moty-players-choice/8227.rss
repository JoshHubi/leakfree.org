            <p>Are there actually any mods worth playing which have made it OUT of development?</p>
<p>I see endless mods which have been in development for the past 800 years and yet nothing which is actually playable (or worth playing)</p>
<p>The only one I play that was really an excellent mod is Oblivion Lost for STALKER.</p>
