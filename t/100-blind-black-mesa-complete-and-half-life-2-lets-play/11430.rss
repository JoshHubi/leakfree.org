    <title>100% Blind Black Mesa (Complete!) and Half Life 2 Let&#39;s Play!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/100-blind-black-mesa-complete-and-half-life-2-lets-play/11430</link>
    <description>Hey guys, a few weeks back I completed my 100% completely blind Black Mesa Let&#39;s Play - It was also one of my very first Let&#39;s Plays. When I say 100% completely blind, I mean that I have never played Half Life before that moment. Though after I completed my playthrough, I went back and played Half-Life so that I could see the Xen chapters.

My subscribers asked me to continue the series by playing Half Life 2 so today marks the day that I began my Half Life 2 journey! 

Admittedly, my Black Mesa series may have felt a little bit rushed in the quality department. That was mainly because I wanted to complete the game while it was still new and before the Steam release (if and when that happens). With Half Life 2 I&#39;m focusing more on making quality episodes from what I&#39;ve learned over the time it took me to complete my Black Mesa LP. Anyway, I&#39;m jabbering on too much, let me get you some links!

            <p>It was fun BECAUSE it was frustrating to watch. It does seem you got your stride as the game went on though. At first I spent a lot of time trying to will you to see the way forward. I’d find myself saying ’ You are SOOO close, it’s right there!’</p>
<p>As things went on you seemed to see how the level design and gameplay nudged you in the right direction.</p>

<p>Thanks! I almost didn’t come back to this thread because of the whole “blind” discussion. Not that there’s anything wrong with it, I just felt like this thread was a lost cause. So, I’m happy to see at least a couple people were able to look past that!</p>
<p>Admittedly, playing Black Mesa without any Half Life experience probably wasn’t my greatest idea. I received a lot of hate comments because I struggled in areas that seemed obvious to some people. None the less, many have told me that Black Mesa itself is harder then the original Half Life games so watching me learn the game for the first time probably didn’t do justice to a mod that basically rebuilt an already amazing game! But I don’t regret it. Some people found entertainment watching me struggle to get on everyone elses level and those were the people I was targeting the whole time. All I’m saying is that there are other games that share an audience that is more acceptable to people playing for the first time but I don’t regret it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>No offense taken. You’re absolutely correct that it’s hard to be different in the Let’s Play community. As a suggestion, maybe you guys should post some forum guidelines and make a rule against posting Let’s Plays if you don’t want people posting them here? I can’t speak for everyone but when I’m sharing my Let’s Plays on forums, I’m careful to make sure I’m respecting the forums community.</p>
<p>Excuse me for saying so but I was definitely a little taken back by the reaction I received. I’m not saying I expected nothing but positive feedback but after reading other threads to make sure what I was posting was acceptable I didn’t expect my thread to be the poster for anti-Dude commentating over a game videos (or anti-LP’s).</p>
<p>Again, no offense taken. I realize now that you guys would like to see this forum taken in another direction and I’m cool with that. I will not post anymore LP related thing’s in the future.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Neither am I… most of the time. But yeah, don’t take it personally Vetriz, it’s more the fact that we get a new Let’s Play thread created nearly every day, and they’re all the same thing: A dude playing black mesa and talking at the same time. Gets old pretty quickly.</p>

            <p>don’t worry, moderators are cool about trolling here, in fact, moderators are trolls too</p>
<p>Seriously though I think you should have omitted the “100%” from the title, that way people wouldn’t immediately jump to the conclusion that you can’t see anything at all.</p>

<p>Sorry I failed to impress you guys but I will mention that 90% of all the other LP’s out there" have had Half Life experience of some sort. This was literally my first playthrough of any Half Life game. Also, please note that I have been uploading these videos since the day Black Mesa was released. While many may have jumped on some Black Mesa bandwagon at the time of uploading there wasn’t really anyone playing completely “blind” like I was.</p>
<p>And I’m sorry the term “blind” confused you. In the Let’s Play community it’s a common term used to describe playing a game that you have never before played. The reactions are thus more real because you’re literally experiencing everything for the first time. Since I see almost nothing but Let’s Plays on this forum I didn’t feel like I was doing any harm by linking to my LP but I apologize. It obviously did since you’re a moderator.</p>

            <p>BOOORING.<br>
I thought that by ‘blind’ you meant that you played it without seeing anything.  You played it blindfolded or something cool like that.</p>
<p>Play it blindfolded and I will certainly subscribe to your playlist.</p>

            <p>Hey guys, a few weeks back I completed my 100% completely blind Black Mesa Let’s Play - It was also one of my very first Let’s Plays. When I say 100% completely blind, I mean that I have never played Half Life before that moment. Though after I completed my playthrough, I went back and played Half-Life so that I could see the Xen chapters.</p>
<p>My subscribers asked me to continue the series by playing Half Life 2 so today marks the day that I began my Half Life 2 journey!</p>
<p>Admittedly, my Black Mesa series may have felt a little bit rushed in the quality department. That was mainly because I wanted to complete the game while it was still new and before the Steam release (if and when that happens). With Half Life 2 I’m focusing more on making quality episodes from what I’ve learned over the time it took me to complete my Black Mesa LP. Anyway, I’m jabbering on too much, let me get you some links!</p>
