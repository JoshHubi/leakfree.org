    <description>Hi guys,

i need some help to translate english voice to italian voice.

I have extrack italian file from pak file but folder structure and name of files is similar but different  and the only one solution now is listen all english files and all italian and compare it for find the match....too long and unthinkable.

So i ask to you if there&#39;is a map file (maybe) of old half life structure wav files  compare to the new black mesa for find the match easyly.

Thank you!</description>
