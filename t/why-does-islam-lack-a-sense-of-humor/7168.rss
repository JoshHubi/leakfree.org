    <title>Why does islam lack a sense of humor?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-does-islam-lack-a-sense-of-humor/7168</link>
    <description>I finished listening to an interview with the south park guys about their Mormon musical. The Mormon Church, while not all embracing of the musical, acknowledged it and let it be. Why can&#39;t Islam do this. Both are very conservative faiths. I see a lot of humor about jewish culture from jews. Even a few reformed Christians can laugh about their faith, why not Islam?</description>

<p>I’m american and protesting is what we do, all of us, and we do it well. Even the most vehement anti-israel protest by american PLO folks stayed peaceful, no violence, destruction or death,even when calling for the death of Israel.</p>

<p>The Difference there is that other Christian groups come out and actively say that what the WBC is doing is unequivocally wrong, and not part of the faith, anti-Jesus ect.

</aside>
<p>The Catholic church stood by and offered no word of objection as 140,000 people lost their lives in the ethnic cleansing of the Yugoslav wars.</p>
<p>Roman Catholic authorities in Rwanda again offered no objection in the 1994 genocide, and the clergy did not protect civilians in many cases. Furthermore, several members of the clergy have been convicted by the International Criminal Court for their roles in the genocide. Death toll: 800,000</p>
<p>How far do you think a funny cartoon about Jesus would have got you in Rwanda in 1994? Maybe the Lord’s Resistance Army of Uganda would have found it funny? It might have put them off their campaign of rape, mutilation and killing. Perhaps it would have gone down well in a pub on Falls Road in Belfast in the 1970s? Maybe they could have painted it on a paving slab before they dropped it through some squaddie’s head.</p>
<p>Are all Christians lacking a sense of humour then? No, of course not. You just seem to have a very short memory or a selective understanding of the state of the world. The press are victimising Islam, you don’t need to as well</p>

<p>Also, I know for a fact the UK has a right to protest, and I assume the American constitution’s right to free speech covers protest as well.</p>

            <p>Muslims in America live in fear of persecution, profiling or that the the charity they donated to might give money to a terrorist group. Fear is what has kept Muslims in America quiet after 9/11.  That fear makes many of them feel like second class citizens.<br>
Also, can I get a quote of a single Islamic leader (sunni or shia) who said the depictions of Mohamed in Southpark are ok and the protests against it were wrong, or un-islamic, or a bad direction for the faith? Maybe I 'm not paying enough attention. I will stop posting in this thread if I get one and start the scientology version.</p>

react to the humor of Trey Parker and Matt Stone and how WILDLY different they were.</p>

<p>Simple.  The South Park creators (that’s who, I’m assuming, to whom you are referring) make fun of everyone and everything.  That’s their shtick; their thing.  They make fun of Judaism, they make fun of Christianity, they make fun of Scientology, they make fun of atheists, they make fun of Democrats, they make fun of Republicans…any group you could POSSIBLY imagine, they’ve probably made fun of at one time or another.</p>
<p>Why is Islam right out?</p>

            <p>Every humour has its own limit and these limits seem to losen a bit after some time. You couldn’t make a jew joke right after WW2 and I think you still can’t make fun of 9/11. Muslims are aware of that. It’s not like we don’t have any humour at all but when it comes to our religion the limit is reached and our most concern is to maintain this limit. We know that changes take place in a very long time. (Bad luck for Obama trying to change America in only 4 years) We know that a lot changes alter our religion to a bad direction and that’s why it seems like we overreact a little bit if someone makes fun of it. We also don’t investigate in those jokes what is the reason why we react the same way everytime. eg: That one Southpark episode wasn’t even that bad. It wasn’t even insulting Mohammad(sav) but I couldn’t here the end morale so I don’t really know. The episode even explains a little bit of what I just said. (a force that keeps Mohammed away from jokes)</p>

</aside>
<p>Excuse me, but if it was as big a deal as you say, you’d be seeing massive protests in nearly every country in the world.  But, yes, it is an insult to many Muslims to have the image of Mohammed shown.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are things that aren’t a big deal that insult you, John.  The vast majority of the people in the Islamic faith don’t protest, though, and of those that do protest, only a very small (dare I say infinitesimally small) call for death of those do.</p>
<p>Like the Westboro Baptist Church (of <a href="http://godhatesfags.com">godhatesfags.com</a>), these insanely small groups that call for literal death of the cartoonists and such DO NOT REFLECT THE FAITH AT LARGE.</p>

<p>Once again, this is not about the sense of humor of individuals, or Arabic folks, or European folks,  Turkic folks, or Asian folks, who can be any number of faiths, it is about Islam, not as being bad, or lesser, or invalid,  just its inability to laugh or take humor in itself and why it is so taboo to seek that humor. Why and where does that come from?</p>
