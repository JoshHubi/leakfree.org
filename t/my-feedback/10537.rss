    <description>So, I&#39;m in the middle of &#39;Surface Tension&#39; now and so far I really enjoyed this game, even though I have a few complaints, as well some ideas - here they are:

1. Framerates - it can get a little choppy, but I guess I can blame my system for that a little, although I have no problems in other Source games, mainly because there is multi-core support, which I would like to see in BMS.
I know it may be hard or impossible to do, but I would like to know if there is a chance.

My specs: C2D E7200@3.4GHz, HD4850GS, 4GB DDR3 RAM

I also get some weird freeze whenever I kill a new creature the first time, any ideas what might be the problem?

2. Balance - playing on hard, the first few marine encounters were challenging and pretty fun, but after some time I can see them becoming a pain in the butt, especially after QE final and ST. They could be a little less accurate and have slower reaction times.

3. Ichytosaur is too weak and his animations freeze whenever you hit him. I could easly kill him with my crowbar with no damage taken.

Well... I think that&#39;s it for now, I&#39;ll keep this updating.
Thank you for this amazing game!</description>
