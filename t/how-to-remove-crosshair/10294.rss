    <title>How to remove crosshair</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-remove-crosshair/10294</link>
    <description>So i just downloaded this mod and im loving it. Im playing it in 3D and it looks great but the only problem im having is the cross hair is doubled. Is there any way to remove it all together? There seems to be a few options for the crosshair in the options menu but it doesnt seem to do anything whether its checked or not. Thanks</description>
