    <title>Stuck between 2 traffic cones in DM_subtransit</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stuck-between-2-traffic-cones-in-dm-subtransit/13818</link>
    <description>First of all, congratulations for the Steam release and thank you a lot for bringing it there.
I&#39;m enjoying the game quite a lot.
The MP maps are VERY good. I&#39;m surprised. I love them.
Specially Gas Works.


Ok, to the &quot;bug&quot; report.
I was playing Substransit and I was in the train.
Then. I jumped (tried to) over the guard rail at the right where the cones are and got stuck there.

Info:

Now, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m stuck because of the physics or what, but, the cones didn&#39;t move at all meaning that maybe physics weren&#39;t enabled in the server I was playing (Unlikely, I know. SV was &quot;Team Deathmatch NY2&quot;)

Again, congratulations and thank you for this masterpiece!</description>
