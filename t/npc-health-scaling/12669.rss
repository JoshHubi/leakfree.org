    <description>Would someone be able to tell me how [i]Bλack Mesa: Source[/i] handles difficulty scaling in regards to the damage dealt by NPCs &amp; the amount of hit-points that they have? I know the skill.cfg file gives the values for &quot;normal&quot; difficulty only, but how much is health they have/damage they can deal per attack increased on &quot;hard&quot;?</description>
