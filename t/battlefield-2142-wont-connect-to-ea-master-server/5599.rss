    <title>Battlefield 2142 won&#39;t connect to EA Master Server</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/battlefield-2142-wont-connect-to-ea-master-server/5599</link>
    <description>So yeah. I doubt that they&#39;re running maintenance or some shit like that, because I called my friend while he was playing and he connected fine. So basically when I choose my soldier then click continue, it says &quot;Connecting to EA Master Server&quot;, but the Cancel button doesn&#39;t light up when you roll the cursor on it and the cursor doesn&#39;t change into a walker like its supposed to, so I had to get out by using the task manager and end the process. Any help, please?</description>

            <p>Yeah, Battlefield is just really buggy like that. When was the last time you installed a patch? Usually its best to reinstall the whole game when you install a new patch.</p>

            <p>I watched The Hurt Locker, went back to my pc, and it’s still there. Well, I ran it again, but it worked this time, but it’ll probably freeze up again when I run it. It’s like there’s a 90% chance it’ll freeze up.</p>
