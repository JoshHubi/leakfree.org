    <title>Any Suggestions?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/any-suggestions/2720</link>
    <description>So, I feel pretty comfortable with my computer knowledge and I am quite sure that I am shit out of luck, but I figure what the hell, I&#39;ll ask anyways:

My monitor likes to lose it&#39;s DVI signal often, its a defect with my monitor, not GFX card. I had a project open in Photoshop, lost my monitor signal and the screen goes black. After failing to recover the signal, I decided to just spam ctrl+s and alt+tab to try and select photoshop and save the project. I then rebooted and I wasn&#39;t surprised to see that the document never saved.. Is there any possible way to recover this particular file?


Thanks to Anyone with advice..  :wink:</description>

<p>Try a new DVI cable. These can go bad and cause monitors/TVs to lose there sync.</p>
