    <title>First houndeye becomes invisible</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/first-houndeye-becomes-invisible/9731</link>
    <description>After dying just past the first houndeye several times, I respawned and come across him this last time and after I  hit him once, he becomes invisible. makes him hard to dodge/kill  :stuck_out_tongue: 

EDIT: I respawned and the same issue occured. one hit and he disappears. I just kept swinging the crowbar until i killed it and on the last swing, he showed up again. hope this isnt common...</description>
