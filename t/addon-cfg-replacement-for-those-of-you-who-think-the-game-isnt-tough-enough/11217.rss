    <title>[ADDON/CFG Replacement] For those of you who think the game isn&#39;t tough enough</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/addon-cfg-replacement-for-those-of-you-who-think-the-game-isnt-tough-enough/11217</link>
    <description>Think Black Mesa’s too easy? I’m gonna post my skill.cfg so those of you who want more out of it can play it with this customized .cfg file. On a further note, this is meant for players who are extremely experienced at FPS, if you aren’t good with fps DO NOT plug this in. 

[color=RED]***WARNING***[/size] I’ve played through this several times and tweeked it to just how I want it, if you don’t like it, you can tweek the ammunition values, etc. to your own specifications. I’m not responsible for any rage you may harbor to the NPCs or otherwise. You WILL get your ass handed to you in several instances, I can promise you that.

While this is really tailored to myself, I’m sure the rest of you can enjoy it as much as I have. Like I stated many times, the difficulty is insane now. If you want to play this on hard, then good luck to you, you&#39;ll be just as easy to kill as the entities are when you swap it to easy.

The list below is simply a change log of everything I did to the .cfg file. If you wish to download it already and skip reading, just get it [url=&#39;https://www.mediafire.com/?e4i4zzd7c42fd62&#39;]here[/url]. I would highly recommend reading it though, so you can know what you’re getting into. The NPCs are not bullet sponges unless you aim somewhere else besides the head.

[u][b]General[/b][/u]:
* Damage modifiers for body parts are universally as follows:
[quote]
Head: 3
Ricochet: 0.6
Everything else: 1
[/quote]
* Flashlight power is now no longer infinite… you can still “sprint” (run) forever.
* Weapon Damage, they are as follows, the damage (where valid) applies to NPC’s weapons as well – in addition, their damage also matches default values, where valid or otherwise noted. The slash is just a divider between the entity getting hit with a [b]single[/b] round from said weapon.
[quote]
Crowbar: 40/whack
9mm (Glock/MP5): 8/round
Buckshot pellet: 9/pellet
.357: 75/round
Crossbow: 100/bolt
Snarks: 8/bite
Hornet (hivehand): 10/round; precision matches the players
Tripmine/Satchel: 150 (per half-life)
Gulon: 20/energy spent (consumption rate cut in half – ammo’s cut to 60 ffs. Had to be done)
Tau: 35/shot; 350/max charge
RPG: Precision &amp; speed matches the players
TOW: 225/missile
[/quote]
* Weapon Ammunition amount changes are as follows:
[quote]
RPG: Reduced to 3
Buckshot: Increased to what’s actually in the box; 20 per pickup (holding values are the exact same)
Bolt: Capacity doubled (20); ammunition pickup reduced to 5
Energy (Uranium): reduced to 60
Frag Grenade: Halved (5)
Satchel: reduced to 3
Tripmine: reduced to 2
Snark: reduced to 10
Hornet: Increased capacity to 24
[/quote]

* Security
[quote]
Hitpoints raised to 120
[/quote]
* Scientists
[quote]
Hitpoints raised to 100

[quote]
Hitpoints raised to 30
Melee does 10/hit

[quote]
Hitpoints raised to 160
Bite damage raised to 35, whip raised to 65

Melee damage increased to 70/hit, range is increased to 94
Charge range slightly increased (256 from 166)
“rage threshold” – AkA how many failed charges before it gives up and just aims for a few melees… the amount is 2

[/quote]
* Alien Controller
[quote]
Hitpoints raised to 160
Movment speed increased to 800 on all axis (400 for those appropriate); in other words, doubled

[/quote]
* Barnacle
[quote]

            <p>I love it, except for the Alien grunt part. Shouldt the “soft” parts (the ones not protected by armor) be their weakpoints and not just the head?.</p>
