    <description>1. Hey guys, it&#39;s acristoff (I forgot my old email so I couldn&#39;t register a new device) I don&#39;t know if any of you remember me but I wanted to catch up with the old crew here and know what you&#39;re all up to these days. Life has changed a lot for me since then and I found the feeling to return here after stumbling on my old forum posts.[/size]</description>

            <p>Yep, I still come in here every day or two.</p>
<p>I’ve been following this mod for so long that this forum has just become part of my life.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m not a high school freshman anymore like I was when I started here. Now I’m a systems engineer who just turned 27 last week.</p>

<p>I’ve been good. Working as a painter and running my own tech business on the side these days. I ended up meeting a girl online in an autistic mandarin woodcarving forum and we hit it off, I’m now engaged and living with her in Vancouver.</p>
<p>What have you all been up to?[/size]</p>
