    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/apb-may-come-back/5763</link>
    <description>&quot;=== 22/10/2010 ===
It&#39;s looking like there might be light at the end of the tunnel for APB. The end of the administration process is apparently close and there appears to be a buyer for the game. &quot;




Fuck yes. :awesome:</description>

            <p>Absolutely. cannot. wait. For this game to return.</p>
<p>I ran a clan on LaRocha (US) called Ex Curia. We ended up getting monthly 1st arrests legit over stat padders. Such a satisfying achievement.</p>
<p>Here’s to hoping they have proper GMs in APB Reloaded.</p>

<p>Well from all I’ve read about k2, APB would have been better off dead. This is just going to leave a foul taste in <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">everyone’s</span></span> mouth. k2 (acording to everyone) doesn’t give two shits about their playerbase, their games are of the pay to win variety, customer support doesn’t exsist unlike the wave of account hackers and cheaters that follow them around. They talk about banning “the <span class="bbcode-i">non-paying </span>cheaters” but that doesn’t even happen appearently.</p>
<p>I seriously hope that everyone is wrong.</p>

<p>EDIT: Well, about it being bought anyways. Sounds like there couldn’t have been a worse buyer out there though…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Buying weapons would really suck. Hopefully the people who get it (if) will actually care about the game like RTW and not just turn it into a generic shooter cash cow. (cough) COD (cough)</p>
<p>The chances of getting our old accounts back are nilx, I would be one very surprised person if I logged on to see all my Stuff/Characters. I’m not bothered if we do have to restart from scratch, I was only buying one month at a time and took my main avatar to the personalize booth for 40+ pictures of the different sliders that are now currently sitting on my desktop. (Yeah yeah, sad. whatever.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>
<p>If it is free to play and the new owners are actually gamers and not salesmen, I’ll probably buy ten bucks worth of stuff each month just like a subscription anyways.</p>

            <p>I have about 1000 RTW points still on my account. (I idled getting money to sell in the tuner and wardrobe, oh god I’m such a tool). I hope they just have some sort of customization limits or something if they do a cash shop. Buying weapons and stuff would suck.<br>
Weapons with reputation/level restrictions wouldn’t be terrible, but still.</p>

            <p>I agree.  Pay to play weeds out the people that want to play it just to troll, but can’t justify spending $XX a month.  On the other hand, some games you just want to keep around, even if you have to deal with the community being worse because it’s free.</p>

            <p>To be honest, I wish it would just be the old payment model. It would sort out alot of the bad community, which was a huge problem anyways without letting them in for free, and they would have more of an incentive to actually keep content creation on the go instead of just forgetting about it.</p>
<p>Anyways, free to play is better than not at all I guess.</p>

            <p>The problem with F2P games is usually low production values and trying to get you into the cash shop, from my experience.  APB definitely doesn’t have low production values, let’s hope that the cash shop is something like Guild Wars, where you can buy extra character slots and other things that don’t unbalance gameplay.</p>

            <p>Yep. But it does sound like we may get it back before christmas. Now this is news coming down the grape vine, so make your own opinions. I google searched Seedy and he IS who he says he is, so…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apbforum.com/forum/social-district/1553-apb-saved-ex-rtw-dev-gave-me-new-info-today.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.apbforum.com/forum/social-district/1553-apb-saved-ex-rtw-dev-gave-me-new-info-today.html</a></p>
<p>Check that thread out. The jist of it is that (acording to Seedy and Arvie) APB will be back before christmas, it is going to be free to play and the company that bought it has only made f2p games in the past, but don’t plan to change the APB gameplay. It’s up to you to decide if you believe them or not, but I’m keeping a very close eye on it.</p>

            <p>The only things I didn’t like about APB was:</p>
<p>I couldn’t run it well. (Not the game’s fault but whatever)<br>
Mics were too quiet. (Can’t hear teammates)<br>
Pay to play. (I bought it already)<br>
MUST choose Europe or America (I have friends in both places).</p>

<p>The new owners need to tweak up a few issues, and most importantly, TELL THE PUBLIC WHAT KIND OF GAME THEY ARE PAYING FOR. :hmph:</p>
<p>and most MOST importantly don’t turn it into just another twitch shooter clone.</p>

            <p>The loading screen was gorgeous, and I didn’t even mind when it was having a problem connecting, I’d just watch that thing go round and round…</p>

            <p>Despite the gameplay needing a lot of improvement, you gotta admit, the <a href="https://vimeo.com/14196092" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">loading screen</a>for the server was awesome.</p>

            <p>APB was garbage. No one liked it. It had a good concept though, hopefully some other gaming company will eventually revive the style.</p>

<p>No that’s cool, I’m NA aswell. hahaha Canadia.</p>
<p>Kenny, did you ever run across StanStanman while you were playing? Big white cowboy hat, Neon blue White stripe jacket?</p>
<p>Something like this : <span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>I was selling used weapons, you may have seen my propaganda or car at one point.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ho-lee shit, you are awesome.</p>
<p>I also play(ed) on the NA servers. Pretty sure my enforcer name was Snaw, and my Crim was something like Cougar. I mainly played as an Enforcer, if only for the Jericho. Loved that car.</p>
<p>If the game does come back though, I would be more than willing to group up with people here. I really wouldn’t care either way if I was a crim or enforcer.</p>

            <p>I was playing two characters- “Silica” for crims and “Rockwell” on Enforcer. My Keys to the City character “Roberts” got deleted when the game went live for some reason.</p>
