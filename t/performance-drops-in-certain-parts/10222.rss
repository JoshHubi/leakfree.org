    <title>Performance drops in certain parts</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/performance-drops-in-certain-parts/10222</link>
    <description>In &#39;We&#39;ve Got Hostiles&#39;, after getting to the surface (badass music starts :jizz :slight_smile: , when I save and load the game from there, I get as low as 20-30 fps, then after a few seconds it gets back to 40-60.
The real problem though is the mortar firing, when it hits the ground the fps tanks to even high 10s. Also I noticed similar problems in the &#39;Blast Pit&#39; in the tentacle chamber, and in &#39;Power Up&#39;, although not gamebraking.
I hope this can get fixed, and am aware that many people are reporting similar issiues.
Even with all these problems this mod is BEAST like OVER 9000 GARGANTUAS!

My specs:
C2D E7200@3.4 GHz
4Gigs DDR3 1333 RAM
Gainward HD4850 GS
Windows 7 x64

Edit: Oh and, yeah the game runs great otherwise, all high with 2xAA, 4xAF in 1440x900 res.</description>
