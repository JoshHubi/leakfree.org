Might be true, might not. I&#39;d love to see a sequel myself.

<p>Also, wasn’t the first ME supposed to be open world? I mean, I know it was <span class="bbcode-i">supposed</span> to be a shitton of things it never ended up being, which is sort of exactly why this is a reboot and not a sequel, right?</p>

</aside>
<p>The fact that what they wanted ended up being pretty different than what they did. The storyline of ME1 was left in such a sorry state after a myriad of content cutting that I would not blame them for starting over.</p>

            <p>Assassin’s Creed is open world too and you can keep a good flow and momentum with the parkour in those games too.</p>
<p>I’m sure it can be done right.</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s open world but the parkour sequences are more focused.</p>

            <p>Really? That seems like a bad idea.</p>
<p>Mirror’s edge was about keeping momentum and moving quickly and fluidly. Unless their open world is incredibly well-crafted, that would probably be hard to maintain.</p>

            <p>Wall-running on a glass wall that’s being shot at?  That’s so crazy I have no choice but to love it.<br>
Also, that company may either be KrugerGeo or KrugerSec, it whips by way too quickly for me to make a decent call, but I’m leaning more toward KrugerSec.  Also the enemies seem to have unique ID’s on their shoulders.  The one holding a gun that Faith disarms first is ERT-2, second, slomo-takedownguy is UPD-4.  I have no idea what that means, but I thought it was a cool detail.</p>

            <p>Like I said, they seem to have distinctly moved from a setting that’s clean, contemporary, and full of fancy architecture to just straight up near-futuristic. It would be hard to justify otherwise.</p>
<p>It’s probably for the best, at least in terms of the famous color palette; some of the stuff in ME1 felt off to me, like someone had taken the environment and whitewashed most of it. The pure white plants in particular threw me off.</p>
<p>A futuristic setting should work better with the vibrant colors, and the game’s overall themes besides.</p>

            <p>Just once I’d like to see a reboot/sequel with either a subtitle or number next to it.<br>
Like wolfenstein NO is doing, or with HD tacked onto it, like serious sam/painkiller/doom 3</p>
<p>I was expecting a Mirror’s Edge reboot maybe ten years from now, and it would have simply been titled ‘F A I T H’ or some crap</p>

            <p>True that. I’ve stuck some 5 or 6 playthroughs in mere 26 hours of time, a few time trial attempts included. Damn worth it for 2.5€ if you ask me though.</p>

            <p>KreugerGeo? Well, the mercenary company that was replacing the police force in ME was Pirendello Kreuger. I’m assuming KreugerGeo is one of the companies that merged to create it, assuming that ME2 is, in fact, a prequel. I could get behind a prequel, even if that only means I get to see Merc again. He was awesome in ME1.</p>

            <p>Looks like the Traceur enemies, or whatever, work under a company called KrugerGeo.  I have no idea what that means, but I like noticing the finer details.</p>

            <p>Glad to see it’s finally happening and that it’s still taking the daring first person route. Combat seems to have improved a great deal, which is good.</p>

            <p>Oh, that looks pretty good.</p>
<p>Seems to mostly be similar to the first game, though I notice there’s more black in the color palette, and the setting looks much more futuristic. The first game was mostly contemporary in setting, just extremely clean.</p>

            <p>I see they kept the same art style. Yes, looks like prequel. I haven’t finished the first game, but it was good.</p>

            <p>If this isn’t true, I might have to march down to EA’s office and slap someone. I fucking loved the first Mirror’s Edge.</p>
