    <title>Map loading broken bm_c2a2a1</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/map-loading-broken-bm-c2a2a1/14983</link>
    <description>The game told me i cant use my current save because of an update. So I started the last unlocked Chapter.
At the first loading zone the game went into the main menu. In the console it says:

[tt]CModelLoader::Map_IsValid:  No such map &#39;maps/bm_c2a2a1.bsp&#39;[/tt]

I also cant load the map manually.
In the game folder I opened /bms/maps/ but there is nothing except one empty folder

Thank you for your help

            <p>You might want to verify the integrity of your game cache. It sounds like your game is loading up the OaRU version of c2a2a no matter what, when it should be loading the stock Black Mesa one.</p>

            <p>I started a new game from Chapter On the Rail but when i go into the loading zone after the elevator with the 4 Turrets the game shows the main menue and in the console says “no such map”<br>
I looked it up and i am subscribed to On the Rail uncut. I unsubscribed and hopefully it will work now.</p>
<p>It still doesn’t work.<br>
Console output:<br>
[tt]CModelLoader::Map_IsValid:  No such map ‘maps/bm_c2a2a1.bsp’[/tt]<br>
[tt]Dropped TE_Morpheus from server (Server shutting down)[/tt]</p>

            <p>C2A2A1 is an On a Rail Uncut map. It’s likely that you unsubscribed from that because it is broken, and that’s why the game can’t find it. The map you should be loading is bm_c2a2a, which is the first map of On a Rail.</p>
