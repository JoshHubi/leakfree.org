    <description>who else has heard of mind jack?

when the hell was this game announced at e3?
it sounds like earth defense force 2017&#39;s creators decided to make another game. if i didn&#39;t know better I&#39;d say it was some kind of 4 Chan meme or shit but its apparently legit.

did anyone actually see this trailer at e3?

            <p>The voice acting is horrible, graphics are okay but not great, gameplay looks really stiff and boring. I think the whole concept of the game is going to fail horribly.</p>

            <p>I played it at E3…honestly it was retarded…</p>
<p>Not only are the controls awful, but the gameplay is retarded and sluggish; I emptied a full clip into a target and he didn’t die due to the regen health…yet I died instantly when he meleed me. Another time I killed someone with a pistol while taking several shots from a sniper rifle.</p>
<p>Once you are dead you move around like a ghost where every player including the opposing team can see you.<br>
So if you are not careful as soon as you enter a body or host you will get raped.</p>
<p>The placement of the hosts are random, but a few times I seen them stuck in a wall or prop.</p>
<p>:fffuuu:</p>

            <p>He sounded like he was doing a comedy trailer. It was pretty funny. Anyway, looks aggressively average and not worth thinking about.</p>

            <p>The guy voicing ruined the trailer.</p>
<p>It doesn’t look bad, but it doesn’t necessarily look good either.</p>
