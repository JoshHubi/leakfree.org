    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vegetarianism-meat-eating/3992</link>
    <description>which one are you ? are you both or one of them ?

and why ?


I&#39;ll start: for me I eat both but since we all know the Vegetarianism is a lot healthier, I eat mainly vegetables. but I hate it when vegetarian people start complaining about meat-eating people and consume animal products beside meat : eggs, milks etc...)

someone even suggested that we should drink &quot;soya&lt;--(spelling?) milk&quot;, no thanks I prefer the real thing.

            <p>My family were all vegetarians accept me and my brother. He’s still quite the meat eater. I have changed from that and like I’ve said before, I’m ok with both types either it being Vegetarian eating or Meat eating.<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a vegetarian. Whoever wants to know “reasons for being a vegetarian” can google it. There are tons of info about it on the internet.</p>
<p>I still consume milk and eggs, I just don’t eat slaughtered animals, birds or fish. Any nutrition that a good steak can give you can easily be replaced by vegetarian alternatives, so I see no need to eat meat. I feel healthier with it, and after I tried to return to meat-eating once and ended up feeling very unhealthy from it, I am confident that my choice was right.</p>
<p>I think vegans go too far in their quest for righteousness. It’s not about the ethics for me - it’s about feeling well with what I eat, and also about sparing the environment a little. With every consumer that stops eating meat, the overall need for meat in the society decreases a tiny little bit. With the decrease of need, the decrease of supply goes. The less meat production there is on earth, the better for our environment and - ultimately - the people that live on this planet.</p>
<p>I don’t go around playing “vegetarian missionary”, though, 'cause I hate militant do-gooders of any kind. The information on the worldwide benefits of vegetarianism is available, is discussed on TV and the Internet full and wide, is in our bookstores and libraries.</p>
<p>If people choose to ignore it, you cannot force them. They are by definition leading an ignorant lifestyle on the expense of others (unless they only eat <span class="bbcode-b">eco</span> meat &amp; fish, of course -  there is nothing wrong with that), but they are doing so in a free society where they have the right to do so.</p>
<p>I don’t like it, of course - but then, I also don’t like people to be religious. However, the vast majority of people on Earth still is. I won’t change that by simply being an Atheist or even advocating Atheism wherever I go.</p>
<p>I’ll just make myself a lot of enemies.</p>
<p>That’s not what I want. So I don’t do it. You don’t have to agree with people’s lifestyles to be friends with them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well said, I am in the vegan path too. I have eaten meat all the way up to when I was 13 But I then change to eating a salad after wards. I was tired and lazy when I eaten meat. Eat the greens eat only greens. When I started eating as a vegan I felt healthier as well. I respect both meat eaters and vegan eaters. If we can have every take the vegan path, The world would start changing more in much stronger and less fat crazy people along with people suffering heart attacks</p>

<p>Explain this for me, because it just sounds like you’re pulling a cliche emotion grabber.</p>
<p>Even then, do you realize that our vegetable and fruit industry is also quite damaging to other countries?  Relating to the Arizona thread, our corn industry is destroying the economy of Mexico, since it provides cheap produce.  We dump it into their country to make a buck, and so their way of commerce is destroyed.</p>

            <p>The headdesk was in response to the gross misunderstanding of what I last posted.  I didn’t say it was going to be my last post in the thread, just my last post on the subject.  Now, if you’ll read that post, you’ll understand that both mattemuse and spooboy both misinterpreted the post and then decided to laugh at the misinterpretation and at what they believed I said (which I didn’t say at all).  Hence the headdesk.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to keep misinterpreting my posts, then I don’t see a need to continue this further.  Laugh all you want at me if it makes you feel better.  I just felt the need to defend myself.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here is the last post on this subject I’ll make:</p>
<p>You can certainly argue that the mass-production of food (of any sort) without regard to the damaging effects to the flora and fauna of this planet is wrongheaded.  I totally agree so this is not a point of contention.  I can certainly argue the wrongheaded approach of liberal use of pesticides, genetically-modified cross-breeding and other insane things done in the world of food-from-plants production including things like overburdening the human diet with high-fructose corn syrups because it’s cheaper than sugar.</p>
<p>You’ll get absolutely no argument from me about that front.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that THAT ARGUMENT is irrelevant in my mind to the choice of whether you “eat meat” versus “eat plants” because THAT ARGUMENT is about saving costs by cutting corners (effectively socializing expenses by moving the costs onto their consumers) and the dangers of unregulated capitalism.</p>
<p>The point of this thread, however, is the debate between eating meat and eating plants.  You can debate the morally-ambiguous “inhumane treatment” argument because, through evolution, animals from the jellyfish (with no functioning central nervous system do not feel pain or, arguably, sentience) all the way up to our closest relatives in the Primates family and everything in between have a range of qualities that one could draw a line on whether it’s okay to eat them or not.  Where you draw the line is arbitrary at best.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I feel the best argument for vegetarianism appeared in the Half Life 2 parody comic, “Concerned”:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hlcomic.com/index.php?date=2006-01-16" data-bbcode="true"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f4086c3679e9de8eeb89059690e5127459ca9b40.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="yOOxZSdPo31FQoMZGuQTxD3Wtva" width="160" height="120"></a><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">(click the picture to go to the comic’s context)</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>I’ll leave you with this:</p>
<p>The Homo sapiens species is evolutionary conditioned to eat both plants and animals, as evidenced by our cuspid teeth (aka “canines”) which we share with other omnivorous species.  We are an omnivorous species.  We eat what is available to us.</p>
<p>The choice to remove meat from your diet, for whatever reason, is yours and yours alone.  If others want to hear why you’re a vegetarian, then great.  Otherwise, you’re proselytizing where it’s not desired and you come off as a giant asshat.</p>
<p>Same, too, for the meat eaters out there!   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Are you being sarcastic?  Perhaps for the same reason we find it morally abhorant to eat apes.  We do not eat that which has a sense of self, a moral compass and the ability for abstract thought. Not to mentionn the evolutionary hard wired instinct to feel remorse and empathy for the young.</p>
