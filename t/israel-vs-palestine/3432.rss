    <description>Debate. Remember if you state something big, try to back it up with evidence  :slight_smile: 

I believe the Israeli&#39;s should move out of the land that is already occupied. Seriously their method of thinking is just as bad as terrorists. So what if it was their land 100 years ago? Doesnt give you the might to just reclaim something you lost along time ago.

The UK and specially the US should be ashamed of themselves for playing apart of the invasion of Palestine (supplying ammo and weapons).</description>

<p>Here you go again, I talk about the jews because I mean just the bloody jews! Yet you keep insisting that when I talk about the jews I actually mean all Israelis.</p>
<p>It is <em>you</em> who thinks I mean the entire Israeli nation when I only mean the jews, as in the jewish population of Israel.</p>
<p>This is your entire argument, this is what you’ve been repeating all along, yet it’s completely untrue. I never said or implied I meant all Israelis when I was talking about the jews.</p>
<p>When are <em>you</em> gonna get this through that thick skull of yours?</p>
<p>This discussion is finished, you’re just gonna keep repeating this “fact” of yours that I mean all of Israel when I talk about the jews. Despite the fact that I never did.</p>
<p>You’re a pompous pissant who just drones on and on even after I’ve said it’s not true.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes but I was still talking about just the jews, not the entire Israelis. And yes, I probably could’ve said some jews instead of just the jews. But everybody makes the occasional generalization. How often don’t we talk about the Americans or the Europeans as  a whole even though we might just be referring to some of them.</p>

<p>you can keep crying about how you said something racist and I called you on it, or you can learn from it and move on. Your call.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No let’s not. Why don’t <em>you</em> point out exactly where in Bonaparte’s balls I said something that fits the general definition (not your own twisted version) of racism.</p>
<p>I think you have come to a point where you can’t bullshit your way out of this anymore and decide to claim that I “just don’t understand”.</p>
<p>So just post my entire quote(s) of whatever you think is racist, and say exactly what you consider racist about this, and we’ll even let other people decide whether they would consider that racist too.</p>
<p>Your entire claim of me being racist seems to be based on the perceived fact that I meant all Israelis when I only said jews. Which I didn’t and don’t, I only ever talked about the jews (and Palestinians), and only ever mentioned the Israelis to clarify that I too recognise the difference between jews and Israelis.</p>
<p>Sorry people, to drag this on, but I don’t like being called a racist or a retard by someone who seems to insist I said or meant something I didn’t say or mean.</p>

            <p>Thats weird, i searched the debate forum and didn’t find anything similar to this topic (unless its in the debate forum and is hidden and shows up only in forum searches). Anyway, i think this thread fails. I was hopping that someone from Israel was on these forums and could try and show their side of the story, but from the looks of it there aren’t any Israelis here. Its particularly all one sided views here…(and to actually debate something u need a two way streak).</p>

            <p>Matt- Sorry I misunderstood you, but yes, I think you’re right in your interpretation of the caricature.</p>
<p>And don’t worry Catz, I was somewhat joking  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I am sorry if I offended. I meant no insult.  But there is more activity in this thread than the other. That is why this one is open and the other is not.  My deep apologies for the slight against you.</p>

            <p>chumchum - I was guessing what the cartoon Shadi posted means, nobody is justifying anything here. I doubt that’s what the cartoonist was trying to say.</p>

</aside>
<p>OMFG WTF- I came up with the thread first and this one is kept instead.</p>
<p>But the real stab to the heart is the “already” and the wrongly patronising "Please have a look around. " part :’(</p>
<p>But yes, you’re right Mattmuse but the hypocrisy of nations by no means justifies some of Israel’s actions<br>
(Or in fact it’s existence- but I must admit it’s far too late to question that, and to do so may give Arab Palestinians ever more right, but does nothing to solve the current problems.)</p>

<p>They could certainly give more financial and construction aid to the palestinian territories. Alternately the cartoon could be criticizing Arab nations that have favorable trade relationships with Israel (like Jordan, where the artist is from), yet maintain inflammatory rhetoric against them.</p>

Conflict and other diplamatic pressure has failed them, if anything trying to retake Arab land forcibly has only led to the loss of ever more control, and now the quasi totality of Arab Palestinian sovereinty, they need the support of other nations (Other than Arab states of course). Which is also why I’m quite so opposed to my countries’ (US &amp; UK) favouritism towards Israel, despite hollow words of condemnation which never lead to anything. I find that support seems to be given for other political interests rather than what’s truly right.</p>

</aside>
<p>Note how the yelling Arab is “attached” to the Israeli bulldozer. I think the cartoon is mocking Arab states for not matching their rhetoric with actions to support the Palestinian cause.</p>
