    <description>So, I was playing through Anomalous Materials for the 500th time when I stumbled into the Sector C break room and blew up a man&#39;s casserole because [s]I&#39;m a psychotic, bloodthirsty individual[/s]I was bored. The two other occupants lament on my action, and brace for the soon-incoming Dr. Magnusson&#39;s [s]slave[/s] assistant, who has been ordered to retrieve his meal. The assistant, not wanting to incur the wrath of a short Caucasian man, begins the long journey back to [s]Magnusson&#39;s lair[/s] the lab he and Magnusson work in, right above where Drs. Vance and Kleiner work. He walks in to the lab, informs Magnusson that his food is ready, and begins to act busy. The rest is history.
