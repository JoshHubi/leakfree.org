    <description>Hello, I apologise that my first thread isn&#39;t very helpful to the other folks that have been here longer than I have, but I do wish to know what, for the more scientifically-inclined/Stormseeker, these snippets of the asset c2a4x_labboard5 say:

[url=https://localhost/mybb/attachment.php?aid=3760][img]https://localhost/mybb/attachment.php?thumbnail=3760[/img][/url][url=https://localhost/mybb/attachment.php?aid=3761][img]https://localhost/mybb/attachment.php?thumbnail=3761[/img][/url]

The former has a Feynman diagram accompanying it, and the latter an equation. I can upload them if you wish.

Thank you in advance.</description>

<p>Thank you very much. I understand it was a silly question to ask, but I appreciate it nonetheless.</p>

            <p>Majoring methemagics I know I am not the most scientifically inclined person here, but I had examined the whiteboard texture to get used to Dr. Horn’s writing and it seems the first word in the first page is “gravimetric”. First I thought it starts with “ge…” but I noticed he writes “r” like “e”, as seen in “Do not wipe the board! - Dr. Horn”.</p>
<p>The word under it refer to the inhomogeneous electro-magnetic wave eq but I’m not sure the corrolation between it and the gravimetric science.</p>
<p>The second letter in the second picture I thought it could be covariant. I noticed after Poynting vector mentioned ( S = c/4ㅠ E X B - using CGM notation). My friend suggested “coefficient” but it lacks extra f to be that case.</p>
