    <description>look im trying to find all the bit and pieces to make this game work im not really having any luck/ I downloaded the mod off the Australian mirror site only to find im missing 2 components to make it work the exe file why the hell there was no exe file included beats me. and the other file which I think I need which is the BlackMesa.md5 file which I can&#39;t get any where I found it on file front but I can&#39;t download it for some reason, can some one clear this up because really seems to me this installation tool where really slap happy which I find funny seeming these people spent years of there life building the game only at the end when they go the share it go oh fuck it that will do.


Ok update/ iv try&#39;ed the torrent the dev&#39;s provided and it does not work all it gives me is a news tracker which I can&#39;t make to do any thing, can some one clear this up because this is ridiculous no way should it be this hard.</description>

            <p>TL;DR,<br>
Step 1. install Utorrent<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]Step 1a. Learn how to Google, save this info for future reference.[/SIZE]<br>
Step 2. Open BlackMesaNewTrackers.torrent with it<br>
Step 3. Click okay and wait.<br>
Step 4. Exit Steam, Run BlackMesa-Setup.exe (Most likely located in <span class="bbcode-i">Downloads\BlackMesa</span>)<br>
Step 5. Apologize to the helpful forumgoers.<br>
Step 6. Play Best mod this side of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Usually I’d also say “seed,” but I can tell that’ll only open a brand new can of worms.</p>

            <p>First, chill out.</p>
<p>The MD5 downloaded fine for me.  As for the torrent, you need a client that will download from torrents.</p>
<p>The following are what I used in Windows with success:  <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/" data-bbcode="true">BitTorrent</a>, <a href="https://www.utorrent.com/" data-bbcode="true">uTorrent</a>, and <a href="https://www.vuze.com/" data-bbcode="true">Vuze</a>.  Download one of these programs and then open the .torrent file in it.  The program will then begin searching for “seeders” (those people that are connected to the various “swarms” (the hubs that your computer connects to as well)).  Once it finds people seeding the file (allowing it to be uploaded from their computer and downloaded to yours), it will begin downloading (it could take some time for the torrent client to begin downloading especially if very few people are seeding at the time.  However, once you connect to a seeder, you will start to see “pieces” downloading, small chunks of data at random.  The more seeders, the more chunks you can get at any one time as a proportion of your internet speed).  Be patient if it doesn’t start downloading right away; it will start downloading soon.</p>
<p>If a lot of seeders are available, it should go pretty quick, depending on your connection speeds.  Once done, you should have three files in the torrent client’s download directory: blackmesa.7z, blackmesa.md5, and blackmesa-setup.exe</p>
<p>Make sure that all of the three files are completely downloaded, completely exit Steam, and then run blackmesa-setup.exe (which needs the MD5 and the 7z file to work–you can’t do anything with the MD5 file yourself; the setup program must use it) and go watch some cartoons or an episode of Breaking Bad or something because it’ll take a while to install.  Then load up Steam and “Black Mesa” should be available in the list of games.</p>
<p>Let me know how it turns out.</p>

            <p>look im trying to find all the bit and pieces to make this game work im not really having any luck/ I downloaded the mod off the Australian mirror site only to find im missing 2 components to make it work the exe file why the hell there was no exe file included beats me. and the other file which I think I need which is the BlackMesa.md5 file which I can’t get any where I found it on file front but I can’t download it for some reason, can some one clear this up because really seems to me this installation tool where really slap happy which I find funny seeming these people spent years of there life building the game only at the end when they go the share it go oh fuck it that will do.</p>
<p>Ok update/ iv try’ed the torrent the dev’s provided and it does not work all it gives me is a news tracker which I can’t make to do any thing, can some one clear this up because this is ridiculous no way should it be this hard.</p>
