I like the feature list. It can do a lot of cool things. But Nintendo has been the best selling handheld for some time, and not even Sony&#39;s financial clout has been able to wrest away control of the market. But hey, Steam on the go!</description>

            <p>this product is not new or original, or useful since it only works on local area network</p>
<p>Basically you can just take your existing(I know you have one) X360, PS3 or Wii controller, pair it to your smartphone via bluetooth(and tape) and with an app called Splashtop you can stream games from PC, also Splashtop allows to stream games over the cell network, if your data plan doesn’t have a download limit.</p>
<p>Nvidia just made this because their tegra3 platform is extremely popular in smartphones and tablets already, they just wanted a slice of the pie that the XPERIA PLAY was eating.</p>

            <p>No, nVidia is tackling the handheld market. They merely request to steam. Besides, this things basically a hand-held PC anyway.</p>

            <p>NVIDIA???</p>
<p>Holy crap WTF where did this come from…</p>
<p>No wonder why their Facebook page was trying to hype people up for their press conference in the hours before it started.</p>

            <p>Pretty unrelated, but I always thought it would be neat if Steam had it’s own appstore for mobile devices. This article just reminded me of that.</p>

            <p>I like the concept of this device, much more versatility. Now Steam will kick ass in Handheld too!</p>

            <p>That would be kinda out of nowhere, but hey. If they can pull a Microsoft and do for handhelds what MS did for consoles, (come out of nowhere and not be that bad at it), then fuck. They should go for it.</p>
