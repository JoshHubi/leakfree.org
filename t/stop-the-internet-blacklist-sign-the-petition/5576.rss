    <title>Stop the Internet Blacklist. Sign the petition.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stop-the-internet-blacklist-sign-the-petition/5576</link>
    <description>In the United States, a new law proposal called The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) was introduced last week, and there will be a hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee this Thursday.

If passed, this law will allow the government, under the command of the media copanies, to censor the internet as they see fit, like China and Iran do, with the difference that the sites they decide to censor will be completely removed from the internet and not just in the US.

Please see the following article from the Huffington Post for more information.

            <p>If I understand it correctly this law makes it easier for them to take down such content. Now, rather than having to contact the host of the website and get a warrant for the creator’s arrest etc. etc. they can just DDoS it with their super computers.</p>
<p>I just gathered that from this thread, though, and even this thread has tons of bullshit so i could be wrong</p>

            <p>So here’s something I don’t think anyone has asked yet:</p>
<p>If the bill will only effect american-based websites, and it only effects sites that are infringing copyright laws and similar, why the hell does this law need to pass? Copyright laws <span class="bbcode-b">already exist</span>, else I wouldn’t be talking about them.</p>
<p>It just sounds to me like a pointless law because <span class="bbcode-b">it already exists</span>, just not directly regarding the internet. If there is enough evidence to envoke this new law then there’s surely already enough to take the website down and prosecute the owners the old fashioned way?!</p>

<p>I hope that everyone realizes sites such as Youtube would be blacklisted. I mean, it’s full of “Pirated” songs, right?<br>
It doesn’t matter if Fair Use laws allow it, if it contains ANY copyrighted material, Youtube is going down- Just like WMG has been doing to the videos on it for years.<br>
Not to mention any Blog critical of the Government, and god knows what else.</p>

<p>His birth papers? See, that’s exactly the blind ignorance and fear he was talking about. The president doesn’t have time to address every ridiculous (and clearly xenophobic) accusation thrown at him by wingnuts, especially ones that are continually thrown out by the courts.</p>
<p>And again, that you’re dragging Obama into this makes no sense. The president doesn’t pass laws, he can only veto them or sign them into law. This issue only has to do with congress. Even if Obama were the most corrupt person in the world, it would have no bearing on this bill whatsoever.</p>

</aside>
<p>I already posted a direct quote from the bill that proves this wrong. It has to be shown that the main purpose of the website is the distribution of pirated material to get it shut down. Don’t give me that crap about not seeing the “gravity” of the situation, please.</p>

            <p>This isn’t anything to be worried about.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario is /b/ DDoSes the government servers x10 harder than the government servers DDoS any other site, and the government abandons it for being too costly.</p>
<p>Censoring the internet is one of the most pointless things anyone could attempt.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that’s pretty bad. They should fine or arrest the owner of the site and/or have the owner shut it down. Alternatively they could have the owner of the server take it down. That’s the only way I can think of for this to be acceptable.</p>

<p>Exactly. They don’t shut down the site, they just block us from seeing it. That’s the problem I have with this law.</p>

<p>Blind fear, ignorance, exaggeration, shall I go on with what else is wrong with this statement?</p>
<p>Seriously, has the media trained you so hard as to freak out about things you don’t understand that you do it without thought.  Come on! regulation of Internet websites turning into concentration camps?  You sound like a ten year old regurgitating the beliefs and fears of his ignorant mommy and daddy.</p>
<p>Seriously this statement is exactly whats wrong with how people interpret news.</p>
<p>Edit: Also I find it amusing how you jump to blame Obama despite this piece of legislation coming from congress.</p>

<p>The thing about this rule that I don’t like is the approach they are taking to solving the problem. I fine and all with shutting down illegal websites, but that’s not what they are doing. They are not disabling the site, they are blocking people from it. So they aren’t attacking the site, they are attacking the people. Idk I’m just thinking out loud here. I guess I’m gonna go with DinoThrasher here, censor is the wrong word.</p>
