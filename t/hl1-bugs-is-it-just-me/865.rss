    <title>HL1 bugs - Is it just me?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl1-bugs-is-it-just-me/865</link>
    <description>I replayed HL1 (non-source; non-steam version) lately, and I noticed a crapload of bugs that I didn&#39;t remember happening. This isn&#39;t a complaint or anything, I just have to talk about it  :frowning: 


* Getting stuck in some corners, especially while ducking
* Had a quicksave where I was very alive and not in danger, and whenever I quickloaded it: instant-death... F7 -&gt; *splat*  , F7 -&gt; *splat* , F7 -&gt; *splat* , etc.
* The most annoying one... for some reason, the world collisions got screwed up a lot of times, when there were moving platforms:
[list][*]Some elevator in On A Rail; as soon as it reached the top position, I couldn&#39;t move at all anymore... not even duck, not even jump... and this was on 100% of the times I made it go up there.
* The lower platform in the first area of Xen, that goes around the big island... when I jumped back on it, I was somehow blocking it from going up, as if I was jammed behind it and the big island&#39;s roof... but I was far from it. So I just kept getting damaged and eventually died. Oh, and I couldn&#39;t move either &gt;=(
This happened in MANY areas with moving platforms, dunno why.
* In Xen, the big pillar thing that moves up and down; if I stayed on it all the way up, I&#39;d get stuck at the top, just like the elevator mentioned earlier.
* While fighting Nihilanth, there&#39;s one area you get warped to that you have to go up by sitting on a small sphere to reach the portal... well it was doing as if I was jammed between it and the roof again; except this time I had no choice but to go up there... Had to continuously jump in place on it to avoid the bug... wasn&#39;t easy :/
[/*:m][/list:u]
It&#39;s like if my installer forgot to install some basic physics laws... 

Anyone else ever got that many bugs? Or know why they&#39;d happen?</description>

            <p>I know this one physics bug in HL2 that I find irritating, yet awesome. If you set the phys timescale to 0, spawn a dropship ragdoll &amp; make it a state, (done in gmod) then turn the time scale back to 1 and pull it out from being stuck in the ground, the dropship will glide around and even fly into the air.</p>
<p>Sometimes standing on props in certain poses, or strangely shaped models can cause a player to fly strait into the air for no obvious reason.</p>

            <p>at the end I used to be able to open up Nihilanths skull, throw in it all of my ammo, including spare grenade kits scattered in that cave and whatever rockets I could find, and then I would crowbar the inside of his head for half an hour or so (or at least for an insane amount of time), and Nihilanth would indeed perform the dying “choreography” (whirling around &amp; waving his arms etc, ejecting bolts of green lightning) …,</p>
<p>but I wouldn’t teleport to the ending tram scene with G-Man.</p>
<p>twas my first time through (also non-steam version), so I thought it was purposeful. he had me going there.</p>

            <p>Like someone said about jumping, if you keep getting stuck on an elevator keep jumping when it’s going up/ just before load and you shouldn’t get stuck.</p>

<p>yeah, they’re all physics related bugs. physics engines are tricky, even HL1’s relatively basic one… so bugs like these appear in a lot of games.</p>

<p>What’s this Spirit of Half-Life mod? I can’t really see any info on the site, and there are two versions marked with STEAM, but the latest version doesn’t have this so could I use those for regualr HL1 too?</p>

            <p>Oh, not being able to reload after coming back from a quickload (most of the times, anyway)<br>
Had to shoot a bullet or switch weapons</p>
<p>Also, sometimes when you switch weapons it changes instantly, other times you see the weapon change animation (gun lowers, new gun raises)</p>
<p>And it would kind of make sense that it’s because of XP, cause last time I went through HL, I was on windows 98… yeah, long ago.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And in On a rail, when you get a loading screen just before a corner, with the train going full speed, then you lose the control and have to ‘use’ again to slow it down… There’s one time that there’s a fucking rocket launcher after the corner… so yeah. I died  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>It’s not just you, there are/were a lot of bugs in HL.<br>
The most common one would be the elevator/verically moving object bug where you get stuck.<br>
Another is the visual glitch with npcs on moving platforms.<br>
I think the elevator bug was fixed in the latest patch for WON, so steam should be at that level or higher. I still instincively jump on the OAR elevator sometimes though.</p>
<p>The npc-on-platform glitch, while not fixed in HL, is fixed in <a href="https://www.goannasvencoop.com/sphinx/FTP/mods/spirit_of_half-life/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sprit of Half-life</a>, which many HL mods nowadays are/were running on (eg. Reissues, NS, DoD.)<br>
It gives a lot of new features and bugfixes.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s not just you. HL was a buggy game at times, and still can be, even with all the patches.</p>

            <p>I had the collision bugs too, even after I ported my won install to steam, but they seem to be fixed now.</p>
<p>My guess is that it was some kind of bug with Windoze Ecks Pee.</p>
