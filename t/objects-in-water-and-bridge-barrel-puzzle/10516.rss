    <title>Objects in water and Bridge Barrel Puzzle</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/objects-in-water-and-bridge-barrel-puzzle/10516</link>
    <description>I have noticed that when you are in the water and your trying to jump on a box or pallet if it hits you somehow it manages to shoot you 20 feet deep.

 I also had a very hard time trying to figure out the puzzle for the raising of the bridge i managed to find all of the barrels and put them underneath of the cage but yet i couldnt make the jump, i believe that it gave me the false realization that i must not have enough barrels so i continued for an hour looking for more. I then took them all out and placed them back again and i still couldnt do it then i ended up taking a couple out and i was able to do it just a fluke but i managed to make the jump. Maybe the fix could be to just have the barrels bring the bridge up another foot to make it easier saying this because we just nearly drowned looking for the barrels lol. 

Other then the odd times that im able to walk through objects and the AI being a little bit to reactive at times this is the best Mod/Game I have played. Matches/exceeds the standard i had set from the original game! But every piece of work needs to be critiqued and il be going through the entire game and finding every single bug i can so i can help make the game even more realistic and fun just as the developers intended.

Edit: in Residue Processing when you are out of bullets you are basically screwed because you can no longer shoot the mines on the conveyors, i had a very confusing time trying to trip them without ammo and nearly blowing myself up trying to throw objects at them.</description>
