    <title>AMD 6850 and 6870 released today.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/amd-6850-and-6870-released-today/5752</link>
    <description>If anybody is thinking of replacing their GPU or building new completely this new offering from AMD is worth noting.

Early benchmarks show the 6870 performing in between the 5850 and 5870 (slightly better than the GTX 460 1gb too) at around $250/£200 which is pretty good value imo.

Not worth the upgrade if you already have a mid to high range 5 series or a GTX4 series but then we knew that would be the case anyway.

The 69xx cards are due late next month.</description>

<p>That is odd.<br>
Most reviews are using samples directly from AMD, not retail versions from actual affiliate companies like saphire in that article.</p>

<p>well a 5 series is around 100£ a 6 series is 130£.</p>
<p>its part of a larger pc upgrade and since this is a lot cheaper than what i was expecting, i’ve ordered it.</p>

<p>At the moment (here in the UK anyway) the 5 series are still going for the same price even though the 68xx cards are better bang for buck.</p>
<p>For example a 5850 cost £200 and and 6870 costs £175 at <a href="http://ebuyer.com" rel="nofollow noopener">ebuyer.com</a>, the 6870 being a good percentage better.</p>
<p>Don’t forget also that the 6xxx series is going to be better at dealing with tesselation etc from dx11. Whether that side of things will compete with the Nvidia dx11 cards is another question.</p>

            <p>I think its kind of lame how they renamed the mid ranged cards and released them first, some people might get confused and thing they’re buying something else  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>If anybody is thinking of replacing their GPU or building new completely this new offering from AMD is worth noting.</p>
<p>Early benchmarks show the 6870 performing in between the 5850 and 5870 (slightly better than the GTX 460 1gb too) at around $250/£200 which is pretty good value imo.</p>
<p>Not worth the upgrade if you already have a mid to high range 5 series or a GTX4 series but then we knew that would be the case anyway.</p>
<p>The 69xx cards are due late next month.</p>
