    <title>Adding wireless to wired?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/adding-wireless-to-wired/3754</link>
    <description>I have a wired intarweb connection at the moment, it&#39;s connected to an 8-port router for when I have friends over that want to abuse my bandwidth.

I also have a Nintendo DS, and from time to time I&#39;d like to play online against some friends, but you need a wireless connection for that.

So I was wondering if I could buy something like [url=&#39;https://review.zdnet.com/product/wireless-access-points/d-link-wireless-n-access-point-dap-1360-wireless-access-point/33968429&#39;]this[/url] and connect it to the router, and have wireless internet, just like that, or won&#39;t that work? If not: how can I get this to work without changing my provider/subscription.</description>

<p>Now that you mention it, the hybrid ones are few and far between nowadays… 4 port LAN seems to be the most you can get.</p>

            <p>I looked into the USB connector already, but it doesn’t work with OSX, Vista or 7. Furthermore, it has massive issues with any OS that runs on 64-bit.</p>
<p>I guess that’s why it’s discontinued, after all  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Cheers for the hybrid router, though, didn’t know those existed.</p>

            <p>If it is jsut your DS you want to use, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/onlineUSB.jsp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">then this will do fine</a>.</p>
<p>I have one and no longer use it. I’ll be happy to sell it to you.</p>
<p>I would reccomend you buy one router that does both wired and wireless, I had too many problems sorting out using 2 seperate devices (specifically, they both fight for DHCP, and its was really hard to access one to disable the DHCP)</p>
<p>EDIT: for lack of info on the Nintendo site… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Wi-Fi_USB_Connector" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">wiki page klol</a></p>
