    <title>Black Mesa server hosting dedicated or shared?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-server-hosting-dedicated-or-shared/14611</link>
    <description>Hey,
im back to Black Mesa after long time and i took some friends with me  :smiley: .
So we would like to setup a server and just have fun.
I want to have good experience and not having lags and other issues with the server and that&#39;s why i thought of a dedicated server that will cost (i guess) anything from $30-50 per month while my friends insist that shared will be alright (WTF just 2 hosts they offer black meas servers? [url]https://nazeboo.com/server-hosting/black-mesa-server-hosting/[/url] ).

What you suggest guys?
The cost of the server is not a problem, i just want to work smooth and of course i would&#39;t like to pay more for the same thing!</description>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I recommend to have a dedicated server, so you can install whatever you want.<br>
For example, you can setup Black Mesa Dedicated Server with a TeamSpeak server  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
I personally use <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=31110088694651ba96897849b9af019c90cf3695" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Linode</a></span> as hosting and I’m totally happy with it. I have no problems running multiple servers with the 1 GB plan, that costs 10$  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
