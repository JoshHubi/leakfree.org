i didn&#39;t get around to really finishing the armor (i didn&#39;t add the feet/shin/helmet sections). i did use the combine dropship for the armor pads. figured a sort of synth armor would kind of make sense since they were pretty much made in factories?

anyway, i would like your feedback and suggestions. even if the devs go over this unnoticed i still want to make it a solid design.</description>

            <p>I could see it going either way. Maybe the hivehand “grows” onto the user after a while and Gordon just doesn’t keep his on long enough for that to happen. If that is the case, it explains why the scientists have several intact grunts but no hands- after growth, the removal process causes way more trauma to the hivehand than the user.</p>

            <p>Damn, that looks really nice! He definitely looks like an alien war machine!<br>
My one criticism is how the hivehand is connected. Gordon seems to be able to slip his on and off at will, and scientists seemed to be able to remove it, as seen on the naked grunt in QE, so I don’t really picture it being connected at the skin like it is on the current concept.</p>
<p>I also like how the armor seems to match the hivehand’s colors! It makes sense that they’d match like a set. Nobody says the Nihilanth has to have no sense of fashion, eh?</p>

            <p>You’re thinking of displacement mapping, which is a different technique using the same kind of greyscale image as bump mapping.<br>
Bump mapping affects the surface lighting via an intensity value, normal mapping affects it through intensity and a direction, and displacement mapping affects the vertex positions.</p>
<p>Out of the three I’m pretty sure source only supports normal mapping. (which it calls a bumpmap fsr. I guess technically it’s right in the same sense that a square is a rectange.)</p>
<p>It’d be cool to be able to have a lod-based displacement map on the model, though.</p>

            <p>There’s also normal/bump mapping to add additional detail to the surface of a mesh, which could potentially be used to make the model look smoother. However, normal mapping doesn’t actually affect the surface of a model the way bump mapping does, it just tricks the lighting calculations into thinking the surface is different, or, at least, that’s my understanding. Could be wrong, though.</p>

<p>As a non-modeler, though, I have always wondered: what do you do to make a model look smooth in-game, when here and in most other outside renders they are very obviously made of polygons?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Depends on the program, but every 3D modeling program capable of producing anything with graphics past the StarFox-era is gonna have the smooth shading option, which will do some form of interpolating on the vertex normals when checked, vs. flat shading which just renders the face normals. Might have some additional stuff they would do, like define some hard edges/break up smoothing groups/again depending on what the program is they call it different things, but the basic jist is they check the “make it smooth” option.</p>

            <p>One criticism I have about the metal is that it seems to have very high color contrast. The green seems to have a sharp, sudden transition rather than a smooth one. It’s fine on the shoulder pads, but on the front chestplate it kinda bugs me. Other than that, it’s great.</p>

            <p>thanks a lot guys. i’ll look into developing the helmet a bit further. also i updated the OP with the most recent image so newcomers don’t have to scroll through the whole thread to see the progress.</p>

            <p>Love the metal, the armslot in the armor finally looks like it comfortably fits the arm, the new shoulder pads are pretty good but I honestly think I was mistaken and the old design looked pretty good too, the texture <span class="bbcode-i">just blows me away</span> (although I would say less <span class="bbcode-i">metal</span> than, again, some kind of carapace)… but I’m not sure if I like the conical/triangular back of the helmet.</p>
<p>EDIT: Suggestion: Have the helmet end where the grunt’s skull does, and then have several smaller plates going back down the horizontal part of the neck.</p>

            <p>played around with the armor.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://i.imgur.com/nCt9L0I.png" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nCt9L0I.png" alt="" width="390" height="500"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">617×790</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>i figured it’s made of some really bizarre xenian metal so i tried to make that evident in the design by giving it weird reflective properties. i changed the shoulder pads back to my original design apart from a few changes. i also matched him to the original hl1 colors.</p>
<p>what do you guys think?</p>

            <p>i’ll work on the shoulder pads since everyone’s been requesting those changes.</p>
<p>also i made the third arm bigger and longer so he can operate consoles/machinery/etc.</p>

            <p>I think you should make the armor look like in your first concept and change the pants to fit better to that kind of design. And yea, I don’t like these edges (steps) on the shoulderarmor of your current concept…</p>
