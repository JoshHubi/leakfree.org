    <title>PCI/E Slots?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pci-e-slots/7827</link>
    <description>So I have a free PCI-E slot (and maybe more PCI slots as well) and don&#39;t really feel like having another graphics card. I know that you can put sound cards, TV tuners, and expansion cards in PCI slots but could someone list or point me to a list of (preferably) everything that can be put into a PCI slot? I&#39;d like to see what my options are.</description>

            <p>Is it worthed it though? I mean if you´re going to get a surround set of speakers, you might as well get a mid range creative card and spend half for what´s going to sound the same, no?</p>

            <p>Eh, just getting the higher quality sound may be enough for me. I only have 2.1 speakers right now and they work fine, I probably couldn’t set up 5.1 in my room anyway. I’ll decide when I actually get enough money for these anyway.</p>

            <p>Source once had HORRIBLE surround sound. Even worse than HL1. Then they fixed it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Yes, it would, the sound would be clearer and nicer, but it would just be that, clear stereo sound. About EAX and other in-gaming sound tech, I´m not entirely sure on how it goes, but I do know for a fact (from putting togueter pcs and so on with different sound cards) that, for whatever reason, you only get the full “deal” in games when using a card from creative or asus, for whatever reason, also, there may be other cards out there on which you get this, just saying that these 2 brands are the only ones I know on which you do.</p>
<p>EDIT: This is why fancy headsets use virtual surround, because they do not depend on the card or game audio tech to create surround that way, again not entirely sure how this tech actually works.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hm, it’s a 7.1 card though. You’re saying that even though it is that, it won’t do surround for games? I could have sworn it has like surround sound emulation or something like that. I’ll have to do more research.</p>
<p>I’d like someone else to come in here and either confirm or deny what you’re saying though.</p>

<p>Ah cable card tuner very nice. Just need to get the card from your provider  (or steal it out of an existing box) That should take of everything (no IR blaster needed as having the card in  the computer takes care of all of the decrypting)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So pretty much all I’d have to do is put the tuner in and then put a card I get from my company in it and that’s that? Does getting the card cost anything? That’d be amazing if it were that simple.</p>

            <p>The reviews for the tuner I was looking at said you don’t need the box, it sort of functions as one on its own. But I do think it said something about an IR blaster.

            <p>Well depending on what you want to capture with it. If your gong to grab basic cable you just connect the coax. Digital cable or satalite TV you need to connect the the provider box and also use an IR blaster so you can control it. As for getting television over the air you will need a digital antenna. If you go that route make sure you have a digital tuner.</p>

            <p>Setting up a tuner card is super simple as long as it is compatible with windows media center. Can usually be up and running in a matter of minutes. (little longer of you need to get/install/configure an IR blaster)</p>
<p>Might want to check out a program called ORB if you get the tuner. You can stream your own tuner card (and the rest of the media on your computer for that matter) over the net to other computers, video game consoles, phones and other devices.</p>

<p>That soundcard is “ok” for sound producing and mixing, However, if you plan on using it for games, good luck. If that is the case go for a creative or asus xonar card, fortunately or unfortunately, it´s the only way to go if you plan on using it for games.</p>

<p>What kind of storage options are we talking about?</p>
<p>And I was thinking of getting a sound card for my free PCI-E slot and if I had a free PCI slot getting a TV tuner.</p>

            <p>Video Capture card. If used alongside other decent equipment, you can do some cool shit.</p>
<p>Of course how you acquire the software to do so would be completely up to you…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Graphics cards<br>
Sound cards<br>
TV tuners<br>
USB port cards (don’t usually plug into the slots - they generally connect to a set of pins on the motherboard - but they do take up the space)<br>

Network cards<br>
Dial-up modems (…)<br>

            <p>So I have a free PCI-E slot (and maybe more PCI slots as well) and don’t really feel like having another graphics card. I know that you can put sound cards, TV tuners, and expansion cards in PCI slots but could someone list or point me to a list of (preferably) everything that can be put into a PCI slot? I’d like to see what my options are.</p>
