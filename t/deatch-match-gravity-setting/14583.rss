    <title>Deatch Match Gravity Setting</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/deatch-match-gravity-setting/14583</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am trying to create a low-gravity killbox type environment with the Black Mesa dedicated server.
sv_gravity works, however, once it gets below a certain value (I think 400), I can no longer jump. Is this a known bug, or maybe intended behavior?

Thanks for any help.</description>
