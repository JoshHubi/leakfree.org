For those of you who don&#39;t know what it is, it&#39;s essentially a copy of minecraft or as they say &quot;Fortress Craft is an independently developed and produced game about construction, survival and destruction.&quot;

I downloaded a trial of it on Xbox Live, needless to say it was shit. It has better graphics than minecraft (not that hard to do) but I&#39;d prefer looking at the minecraft graphics. Also your &quot;character&quot; is your avatar. For some reason your avatar has a pick axe but then pick axe does nothing. You don&#39;t mine things with the pick axe you just delete and place blocks. 

It&#39;s similar to a Minecraft Alpha with some of the Beta blocks and items (such as torchers) added in.  Personally I think it&#39;s a load of crap and I can&#39;t understand why you&#39;d pay for this pile of crap instead of minecraft. 

Oh and also instead of Updates, Fortresscraft gets &quot;Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; etc
So you have to pay for more updates essentially. 

I know minecraft isn&#39;t original in its area either (roblox has been around for a while) but everything in fortresscraft just looks like a better quality version of everything in minecraft.

So Money Making scam or Original Idea? 

Opinions away.</description>

<p>Good luck with recovering it.</p>
<p>On-topic: Everything that is successful is going to eventually get a clone of it. It’s bound to happen. This is just a prime example of it. I wish Developers would actually be creative for a change and make their own product instead of developing some shitty gameplay mechanics on a game that already is out there. <em>cough</em> CoD <em>cough</em></p>
<p>A majority of the time its the mod market I look to more than the game itself, because usually the vanilla (base) client is either A) Buggy, B) too easy (even on the hardest difficulty I.E. The AI is shitty), or C) Just repetitive, and finally D) all of the above.</p>
<p>Consoles lack a mod market (its difficult to get it on there for some brain dead idiot who doesn’t know what they’re doing). However its where the cash cow is at the moment. With the rise of hand helds, I’d give it 4 years before it goes in favor of tablet PCs over consoles (guestimation).</p>
<p>I don’t consider consoles for FPS simply because its annoying to play with a shitty analog stick instead of a sensitive optical mouse to shoot individuals with. The mouse gives you a far greater degree of control, and yes I know by now that there are emulators you can get on your console to play with a mouse instead.</p>
<p>My way of looking at it is consoles are the main platform now, but eventually it will turn to another platform. Ftw, another reason I don’t consider consoles for MP gaming is because of the subscription fee, I don’t want to pay to play something I bought with my own cash for some shitty subscription. It’s a waste of cash imo.</p>

<p>We are getting word from reporters that the world of gaming at we know it is officially fucked.<br>
Increasing popularity of games like Call of Duty and Minecraft have been consuming the market. All we will have within 20 years is Call of duty and call of duty clones, and minecraft and minecraft clones.</p>

<p>People who say this usually have never even fucking played Infiniminer. Yes, the visual style is based upon Infiniminer, but the two games are SOOO FUCKING DIFFERENT… There is way more depth, freedom, and sandbox capabilities in Minecraft than there was in Infiniminer. “Cave Game” wayyy back when, was an Infiniminer clone. Minecraft is a different game.</p>
<p>These clones of Minecraft are just that- they’re not somewhere in between, they’re not as different as MC and Infini, not by a long shot. They’re just cheap ripoffs.</p>
<p>The main place, scratch that, <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> place they ever even touch the core mechanics is the graphics. But vanilla MC is SUPPOSED to be retro- that’s part of it’s charm. Even then, with smooth lighting (ambient occlusion,) and shadows that don’t suck, it looks better than most of the clones. Not to mention all the mods out there to make it look even better yet. (Wildgrass, texture packs…) Other games just can’t compare dicks to MC.</p>
<p>EDIT: Big argument winner in itself: mods mods mods mods</p>

<p>All I can do is laugh at all you non-gamers who try to make themselves feel good by owning multiple gaming platforms.  When you find yourselves in a mature mindset, ready to accept that no one gives a fuck about pretentious assholes, then maybe you can call yourselves gamers.  Until then, you are nothing but whiny hypocrite trying to make yourselves feel important by acting like a snob in a battle that no true gamer takes part in. I pity you.</p>

<p>Why not port it to consoles?  There are plenty of people who play on those platforms for a variety of reasons.  There is not much reason for you not to want it to be ported to console other than being a stupid PC-Fag who wants to maintain some sense of superiority.  As a PC gamer who dislikes the fact that so many games don’t make it to PC for almost no reason, I feel for console gamers who would like to play a game that hasn’t made it to consoles for almost no reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This just in.</p>
<p>We are getting word from reporters that the world of gaming at we know it is officially fucked.<br>
Increasing popularity of games like Call of Duty and Minecraft have been consuming the market. All we will have within 20 years is Call of duty and call of duty clones, and minecraft and minecraft clones. There may eventually be a breakaway point where the clones stop and original ideas begin to flow again (as was with WWII fps clones and GTA clones), but this interview with Gearbox’s Randy Pitchford states that the eventuality of this break in monotony will certainly not happen within our lifetime. “s’not gonna happen anytime soon. These days you need either blocks or perks to get anything done.” stated Pitchford. More on this report as events occur.</p>

<p>Exactly. Same thing with mobile platforms- Mojang is a bit to narrow focused at the moment, imo.</p>

<p>Minecraft itself is not an original idea, in fact it’s a clone from other games itself, specifically, Infiniminer, so all this talk about FortressCraft being a minecraft ripoff is bunk.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>People who say this usually have never even fucking played Infiniminer. Yes, the visual style is based upon Infiniminer, but the two games are SOOO FUCKING DIFFERENT… There is way more depth, freedom, and sandbox capabilities in Minecraft than there was in Infiniminer. “Cave Game” wayyy back when, was an Infiniminer clone. Minecraft is a different game.</p>
<p>These clones of Minecraft are just that- they’re not somewhere in between, they’re not as different as MC and Infini, not by a long shot. They’re just cheap ripoffs.</p>
<p>The main place, scratch that, <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> place they ever even touch the core mechanics is the graphics. But vanilla MC is SUPPOSED to be retro- that’s part of it’s charm. Even then, with smooth lighting (ambient occlusion,) and shadows that don’t suck, it looks better than most of the clones. Not to mention all the mods out there to make it look even better yet. (Wildgrass, texture packs…) Other games just can’t compare dicks to MC.</p>
<p>EDIT: Big argument winner in itself: mods mods mods mods</p>
