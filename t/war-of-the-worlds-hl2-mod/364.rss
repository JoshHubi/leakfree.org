    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/war-of-the-worlds-hl2-mod/364</link>
    <description>This mod actually looks really promising.  :slight_smile: 
It&#39;s great to see people modding on Source. To bad this isn&#39;t as good as BM: Source...

<p>I know it’s “A War of The Worlds,” and not “The War of The Worlds,” so I know several liberties could be taken but the whole mod seems disappointing with it’s complete lack of faith to the original.</p>
<p>I think it would be pretty nice to have a real “The War Of The Worlds” with the original 1898 setting, it would make for a nice change from all the modern, futuristic or medieval settings everything seems to use these days.</p>

</aside>
<p>That would honestly be epic.</p>

            <p>I’m not impressed in the slightest. The models are pretty low detail, some more than others, and many just don’t make sense (<em>cough</em> rocket launcher, pump action, double barrel shotgun, and gatling tank)</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s just a random background or what, but that one shot with the crawler thingy and the plants has absolutely terrible scale.</p>
<p>He might want to learn a little more about Blender before he goes into a career in video games.</p>
