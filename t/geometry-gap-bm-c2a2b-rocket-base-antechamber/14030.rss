    <title>GEOMETRY GAP - BM_C2A2B, rocket base antechamber</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/geometry-gap-bm-c2a2b-rocket-base-antechamber/14030</link>
    <description>Also, this is actually present since the original mod version.  In the room with the soldiers and a mounted gun, where you have to go up to pull a lever, and open the door to access the base of the rocket, there is a window on a 45 degree wall.  From the bottom corners of that window are two small slits in the world geometry.

I realize this is rather small, but with this being a commercial release now, I figure no bug is too small to warrant a few minutes of looking at, and seeing if it&#39;s fixable.

That bit of yellow is the sign on the far wall, around the corner.  The same slit is present on the other side of the window.

I&#39;ve noticed several other small geometry gaps, and one large one, but I neglected to make note.  I&#39;m playing through again shortly, and will be more diligent.</description>
