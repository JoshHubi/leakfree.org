![](upload://ujDUoico3YfWkfkGN6d0tiwNTP.png)

The period and radius of Kepler planets in the sample, around bright stars,
are plotted. The lower right corner is relatively empty, probably owing to low SNR there, not because small planets are absent from long periods. The upper left corner is relatively sparse, in spite of an expected high SNR there, implying a deficit of large planets on short-period orbits. The left side of the diagram is relatively empty owing to an apparent paucity of planets of all sizes at periods less than 3 days. The right side of the diagram is not completely sampled in the current database, so should be ignored here.

            <p>No shit. Civilization is multiplayer.</p>
<p>If you were to cut our quadrant of the galaxy out from the others that have life, though, it’d still be oversized. Would you then see <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> as a waste of space?</p>

            <p>Do you seriously believe that the universe was created just for humans. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Sure none of us will live to see the day when we do reach other planets. But the idea of no other intelligent life out there is ridiculous, unreasonable, and short-sighted thinking.</p>
<p>I’m putting simply in my original post. For there to be ONE planet out of all the universe with intelligent life is illogical thinking.</p>

<p>Except it’d have been totally inaccurate, and by being so wrong it’d have made what his actual statement is fictional. You see, I currently expect the level of intelligence it’d take to say something as mentally-deficient as what you suggest.</p>
<p>He was trying to get me to accept that some of you might be above that. By suggesting it in pragmatic language, accurate by ambiguity, he accomplished the elevation of my expectations (at least for him). But then you went ahead and validated my original opinion.</p>

<p>It’s not a waste of space, it’s room for us to explore.</p>
