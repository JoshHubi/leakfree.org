    <title>The music transition is really loud</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-music-transition-is-really-loud/14497</link>
    <description>It is loud, i know it&#39;s meant to be loud to make you nervous and tense, but it&#39;s wayyyy to loud, it hurts my ears. My volume was on 34 when i first heard it, it was all fine until i got to [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtgzweYgZUo&amp;feature=youtu.be&#39;]this spot (note - the volume was only on 26 suring this video due to the sound being too loud).[/url] It also happened a lot throught the game, it&#39;s not too much of a problem, but when people are shooting at me and i need to turn the sound down, and i&#39;m on 15 health, i usually die.

Also, in the video, that song got louder as it progressed. It actually hurt. I had turned it down after it scared the shit out of me. But then the sound kept increasing. If my sound was on something like 60, jesus christ, i can&#39;t even imagine.

As i said, this isn&#39;t very important, but i&#39;d just like t let you guys know.

Also, you really need to fix the AI.   :wink:</description>
