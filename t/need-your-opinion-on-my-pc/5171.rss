    <description>so when I was in  Germany less than a month ago, I bought this PC from a German website, yup I collected it piece by piece and it roughly cost me 750$, though I do find it a great price for this Computer 

here&#39;s the specs :

CPU Type:
				
Intel® Core™2 Quad CPU    Q9400  @ 2.66GHz	
				
CPU Speed (GHz):
				
2.69
					
System Memory GB:
				
6GB DDR2	
				
Video Card Model:
				
ATI Radeon HD 5700 Series 1G

            <p>Actually, modern video cards are optimized for higher resolutions, enough that I’ve seen my GTS250 perform noticeably worse at 1024x768 than 1440x900.</p>
<p>Also, why would you need a forum’s validation of your PC?  Enjoy a PC because it does what you want to your satisfaction, not so that others can pat you on the back for it.</p>

            <p>I had a Q9450 (pretty much the same as yours), great CPU, if you put on some custom cooling you could easily run it at 3.4/3.6 GHz for daily use (gave me a lot of extra performance).</p>
<p>Also, when you say you can run everything at high, don’t forget to say which resolution you use. I could run any game at highest settings when using 800x600, but 1920x1200 will be trickier.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
