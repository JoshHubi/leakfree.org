            <p>Hola, i noticed some mistakes in the game so far.</p>

<p>in bm_c1a2b a scientist in a room isn’t speaking, his mouth moves and he makes gestures but there’s no sound.</p>

<li>
<p>In the lockerroom where Gordon has his locker there is a texture missing. In the locker from Boetsma the ceiling is missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most women don’t have subtitels when you speak with them, like 90% of them. Language german.</p>
</li>
</ol>
