    <title>DVD Drive Registry Corrupt</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dvd-drive-registry-corrupt/5874</link>
    <description>My DVD drive seems to have died on me. The control panel gives me this error for the reason: 

&quot;Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)&quot;

I&#39;ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers, but that doesn&#39;t appear to do anything. I&#39;d update through the LG website (who the drive is from), but the model doesn&#39;t seem to be on the site anymore.

I have an LG H55L DV-R. Any ideas how to resolve this issue? 

If not, any suggestions on what I should replace it with?</description>

            <p>I’m not sure what causes it, but it’s never happened to me before. It’s just some obscure bug. I just think it’s odd that it happens in that exact key in the registry and doing that exact thing fixes it. Deleting something to make something appear that Windows doesn’t think is there is the most convoluted problem I’ve had for a while.</p>

            <p>That worked beautifully!</p>
<p>iTunes is now telling me the drivers necessary to burn discs is missing… but I guess this just further proves iTunes is clunky and rather useless. -__-</p>

            <p>This just happened to me last week, for no apparent reason, no tinkering whatsoever. Here’s what I did to fix it:<br>
* Make a backup of the registry.<br>
* Go to menu Start and select Run.<br>
* Type regedit and select OK.<br>
* Remove Upperfilters and Lowerfilters values of the following key to the registry:<br>
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br>
* Restart your computer to save all configuration.</p>

            <p>Actually, there’s a lot of information about the Code 19 error on the 'webz. I’ve had it before- the best fix is, essentially, deleting a bunch of registry crap associated with your CD drive. You should be able to find a tutorial for how to fix it online.</p>

            <p>Have you tried updating the drivers from your device manager?<br>
Right click computer, then go to properties. Then, click on device manager. Once there, find your dvd drive, and right click, then check for software update.</p>
<p>Slim chance that will work, but it doesn’t hurt to try!</p>
<p>Edit: Wait… have you been playing with your registry?</p>
