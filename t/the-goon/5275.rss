    <title>The Goon</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-goon/5275</link>
    <description>It all started just looking for random movie news... then I see David Fincher&#39;s name pop up. Intrigued, I click on it. It was news that he is to produce a CG animated film based on Cult classic comic series, The Goon. I was like &quot;huh, I&#39;ve heard of this before&quot;, and that was that. Then out of nowhere I actually see the proof of concept animation for the film.

Holy fuck, man. I had to catch myself up with this series. Just finished volume 1. Didn&#39;t regret it. It&#39;s fucking awesome. Now I&#39;m all psyched for a movie I&#39;m not even sure has been greenlit yet(edit: It has).


Fuck.

Also, I recommend the books to anyone who would be interested in Rated R sam &amp; max with some Sin City elements thrown in.</description>
