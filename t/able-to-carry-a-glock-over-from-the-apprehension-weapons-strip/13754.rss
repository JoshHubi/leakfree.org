    <title>Able to carry a glock over from the apprehension weapons-strip</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/able-to-carry-a-glock-over-from-the-apprehension-weapons-strip/13754</link>
    <description>It&#39;s a minor issue (not game breaking), but I got curious and decided to take one of the assassin&#39;s glocks with me after the fight at the end of apprehension. Let the scene play out, and this happened (no I didn&#39;t manually spawn it):

That said, it&#39;s a minor issue. I&#39;m honestly surprised this was overlooked.

            <p>Yeah. After you’ve killed the assassins, open the gate per usual then grab one of the glocks on the ground, and run <span class="bbcode-u">into</span> the wall (and face it). You’ll pick it up when you get knocked out by the grunts.</p>
