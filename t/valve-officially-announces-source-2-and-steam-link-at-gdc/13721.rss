<p>This’ll be a good excuse to dust off my old Source mapping skills. I was starting to burn out on modding Skyrim, anyway.</p>

<p>I enjoy mapping in Source too, though I wouldn’t say I have skill, 'least not beyond blocks and flat walls in Portal 2. But I really look forward to trying out Source 2’s equivalent to Hammer!</p>

<p>To be honest, I don’t expect perfect graphics from Source 2 (or HL3 or whatever new game will use Source 2 as launch title). I would like a great, open, powerful engine that’s capable of VR, great performance also on low-spec systems (like Source also was and still is) and improved physics.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I still hope it has a significant improvement in graphics, maybe up to par with Unreal 4. I would think it’d be even better optimized than Source 2, hopefully.</p>

            <p>I think we might have a bright gaming future, especially with VR before us. ValvE was always known for thinking outside the box and bringing the  gamers and the developers together… that’s why they made SteamOS, the Steam Machines and VR Device (after the departure from oculus, now with HTC) and porting things to Source 2 and Source 2 itself more open and accessible in the first place.</p>
<p>Get hyped:</p>

            <p>Features I want to see in Source 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal mapped decals</li>
<li>Multiple materials supported on single models</li>
<li>Ability to change material parameters on the fly more easily</li>
<li>Better texture lighting (on par with light_spot and light_environment quality)</li>
<li>Texture lighting can emit from models</li>
<li>Easier implementation of VGUI</li>
<li>All or most of the enhancements that Source hasn’t had implemented yet from other AAA engines</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess we can wait for a City 17 if that’s the case.</p>

<p>Told you guys Source 2 would be announced. I wasn’t expecting it this early though. I guess it’s even more likely that we’ll see Source 2 demos at the Vulcan press conference on the fifth.</p>

</aside>
<p>I wasn’t expecting it yet, either. I had thought we’d see a reveal at the Vulkan conference.</p>

            <p>I hope porting Source content is suuuuuper easy. Even better if Source filetypes are for some reason natively supported.</p>

            <p>We know that they are working on their own physics engine rather than licensing one like they did with Havok for Source 1. It’s called Rubikon. Maybe that means they’ll be working on physics that most standard physics engines don’t do. Maybe we’ll be getting physics based animation system kind of like Euphoria, but for all animations. Like procedural animation. I also remember Valve said they had to cut down on how the gel in Portal 2 worked because of consoles so maybe they’ll be experimenting more with liquid physics.</p>
<p>Also I imagine that Source 2 will support everything that UE4, Cryengine 3, RAGE, and other modern engines do, like tessellation, dof (bokeh), deferred rendering (so dynamic lighting), soft shadows, etc. I’m certain we’ll get some demos of the engine at the Vulcan presentation.</p>
