    <title>Which MP5 model do you prefer?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/which-mp5-model-do-you-prefer/6486</link>
    <description>Hey there, Black Mesa forum members. There have been two renditions of the MP5 submachine gun, the first is a MP5A5 with a GP-30 grenade launcher, EOTech Holographic sight and MP5K PDW-style side-folding stock and the second is a MP5A3 with a M203 grenade launcher and flash suppressor. Which do you prefer? Or, alternatively, do you dislike both MP5 models and instead favour the M4 Carbine? Discuss.

Personally, I prefer the latest version of the MP5 because I find it more aesthetically pleasing. The side-folding stock on the MP5A5 looked weird and unnatural, while the EOTech Holographic sight was really just there for eye candy and had no useful function. The only thing I liked about it was the GP-30 grenade launcher, because it seemed to &quot;fit&quot; better than the bulkier M203.</description>

<p>But seriously, even if you don’t like the MP5 model, there’s more than likely going to be mods where you can switch the weapons out with something else.</p>

<p>I think it would be neat if there was a seperate Development Pack which could be downloaded… I’m not going to use it but some one would.</p>
<p>As for the MP5 the Opposing force2 Mod that put out a demo had a pretty slick little mp5 with a silencer on the end and I thought it was pretty bad ass…</p>
<p>As for the Camo… I think if there were varying degrees of difficulty available it would be pretty neat for them to be remapped to an urban combat style. I might be simple but I never really felt the Olive what ever was out of place when I see green camo I think military rambo’s coming to kick my @$$… I liked it still like it but variety is cool… I did think the beret’s were kinda stupid its like a big red head shot target really…</p>
<p>Either way I think its great the devs want to know what makes us happy but honestly… The MP5 I want to see is the one that’s on my PC shooting the shit out of anything that moves!</p>

<p>The M4 is modelled and (mostly) skinned, but it’s not rigged, animated or compiled. It’s not set up to use our new hands, it has no sounds, it has no world model. It won’t be in Black Mesa.</p>

<p>Will it be included in the game files, in case someone wants to finish the animations and compile a .qc?</p>

            <p>I prefer the older version a lot more, but I think it’s more important that it sounds like an actual MP5 (unlike in the game trailer). The flash the new model generates in the Wiki video looks unusual, but I’m guessing that’s just for testing.</p>

<p>…No. If we went to the M4, then we’d have the security division using Berettas, which in turn suck, which in turn get Freeman dead, which in turn kills us all, which in turn allows the combine to win, which in turn makes us use the M4, which in turn restarts the cycle.</p>

<p>Or, you should be able to choose if you want to use whichever weapon you want. They have both the weapons already made, and they are both the same the only difference is the fact that they look different.</p>
<p>And the Combine were not in HL1. They were brand new to HL2. You went against marines as well as the creatures from Xen.</p>

            <p>The military typically likes to prepare for the worst, not assume that they wouldn’t encounter stronger/armored enemies.  Again, even the guards that they were going to kill were armored.  Also, dumping a Glock mag and subsequently filling a MP5 mag doesn’t happen instantaneously.  It would probably take more than 60 seconds and you wouldn’t fill up a MP5 mag with one Glock mag.</p>
<p>That aside, I already basically said I have no real problem with what BM chooses in the end.  I was more criticizing the choices that were made for the original Half-Life.  I also think the camouflage chosen for the HECU isn’t that out of line/even kind of fits.  Though, the OD Green MOLLE gear is weird.</p>

            <p>Alright, “A bullet is a bullet” wasn’t exactly the right choice of words. It’s not like it’s not possible for a glock mag to be emptied and an Mp5 mag to be filled with loose rounds.<br>
Besides, it’s a video game, and Valve chose the Mp5 over the M4 in the end, despite what the beta had.</p>
<p>Most of the xenian forces are completely unarmored, as well, And there’s no guarantee they didn’t know about that; Questionable Ethics revealed that quite plainly.<br>
Also, they’re not changing the camo, but you’re free to when the mod is released.</p>

<p>I don’t see why not; A bullet is a bullet, and 9mm bullets have proven to be very reliable over the years. Besides, if you’re going in to fight things you know nothing about, nor how strong they are, you want lots of ammo. 9mm rounds were what the security division was using, and as such there’s a crapton of 9mm magazines everywhere. (There are much more in the BMRF than, say, railings)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If a “bullet is a bullet”, then why are non-9mm rounds ever used?  Might as well just have everything use 9mm, no?  Also, the military would surely bring their own ammunition.  Plus, Glock mags lying around everywhere would mean nothing to them, just because in the game you can pick them up and they instantly go into your ammo supply does not mean that things actually work like that.  You have to take all of the rounds out of the Glock magazine and put them in an empty MP5 magazine to be able to use them in a MP5.  That’s something you don’t do in the middle of a mission as it’s time consuming and will probably get you killed.  If you know nothing about the enemy and you’re going on a “kill everything in sight” operation, then taking a weapon that uses 5.56 (like the M4) over the 9mm makes a lot more sense.  Plus, you already know you’re going to have to kill armored security guards; theoretically, their vests/helmets should stop 9mm rounds.  Like DODcrazy said, 9mm is meant more as either a secondary round and/or a soft-target round.  They knew they would be dealing with more than just scientists.</p>
<p>I have two 9mms, but I wouldn’t go to war with those alone.</p>

</aside>
<p>My mistake, then.  I was under the impression that BM was set in 1998.  That said, I still think it was the very early 2000s, judging by the equipment.  They only use CRTs in the facility, for instance.  Flat panels became increasingly popular in the early-mid 2000s, and you’d expect to see some in a high-tech, government funded facility in such a time period.</p>
<p>That T-pattern isn’t the prettiest, but it would be cool to see in-game, and make sense that a covert unit was testing it out.</p>
