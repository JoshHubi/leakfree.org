            <p>You mad?</p>
<p>I wasn’t mad. I just kinda felt it to be unnecessary to continue after chapter 1, what with the missions repeating and the fact that they very suddenly threw in “oh you’re not reaaallllyyyy big boss” to avoid the obvious questions of how the later timeline works.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a horrible, shitty ending. It just wasn’t a great ending either. Loved the rest of the game, and I was glad they took the Mother Base features from the previous title as well as I was a fan of PeaceWalker.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of bugs, the only thing I ever encountered was the funny story I had above. And even then I’m not sure it was a bug but more of an oversight, perhaps. But hey, not every game is for every person, some people really like certain gameplay, others prefer the totally opposite. I felt this was a different kind of gameplay from most of the other games in the series, but not in a bad way.</p>

            <p>Enemies not reacting to barrels exploding within 5 meters of them, not getting a memo after you turn off the generator 5 times in a row, searching for intruder after you drive an apc or a tank near them, at the same time paying absolutely no mind to an obviously foreign camouflaged armored vehicle going right through their outpost…</p>
<p>Buggy mess.</p>
<p>The rest of it, basically Peace Walker 2 (aka Metal Gear Happy Farm) with incrustations of Far Cry, GTA and Splinter Cell, which makes sense considering…</p>
<p>The gameplay feels anything but MGS.</p>

<p>I’ve beaten it now, finally. And it was spectacular, right up until the second chapter. Honestly they could have just ended it at the end of chapter 1, but they kinda fucked it up at the end for me with a really lame plot twist that kinda makes sense but still sucks.</p>

</aside>
<p>So you’re mad that this boring, pointless, ineffectual dud of a story with shit characters and butchered old roster didn’t actually happen with Big Boss?<br>
Seriously, you could put the switcheroo anywhere in between the end of MGS3 and beginning of MG1, it wouldn’t change shit.  Other than doing us a massive favor ofretconning those pieces of shit between the games that didn’t actually suck.</p>
<p>If anything, the only thing good about the game’s story is a fucking plot twist at the very end. Not least because it makes  the fanboys  so butthurt.</p>

            <p>Even the accidents in the hitman games I’ve played kinda put everyone on alert.</p>
<p>It’s a small thing, and one that id imagine doesn’t happen often outside of explosions (in which case they know you’re there already) and it was more hilarious than annoying to me haha</p>

            <p>Not sure how difficult it would be to implement something that would distinguish an enemy killed by you and killed by not you. Doesn’t sound like it would be hard but I can’t think of any game that does it. Maybe Hitman’s accidents count.</p>

<p>I give the game a 10/10 for gameplay, a 9/10 for graphics, and a 7/10 for satisfaction with the story and plot.</p>
<p>Cause it was still good, just not what I wanted.</p>
<p>Edit: funny ass story</p>
<p>I was quietly sneaking up to an outpost when a couple Russians in a jeep literally creamed one of their men. They got out and called CP and said “we have a dead friendly, possible hostile.” And then went on alert status.</p>
<p>Like. Fuck you guys. I didn’t kill him don’t blame me. I was gonna save his A++ R/D ass.</p>

<p>No more 2 week delay for PC. Hopefully they’re not just pushing it out early with bugs and that they actually got ahead enough to push the release date up. Really happy about this.</p>

            <p>But there doesn’t have to be a two week wait.  Have all the versions come out on the 15th. That’s what a sane person would do. A not sane person would arbitrarily release all the versions on different dates like everyone seems to be doing as of late.</p>
<p>And the port was good but they still had quite a few issues that needed fixing in patches and some stuff that still isn’t fixed. And cut content (custom heli music, no mobile app support, etc). The problem is you’re equating a delay with a good version and no delay with a bad version, which is what all the companies doing the delays want you to do. A good company would be able to do a good version on time, or at least not release some versions before others.</p>

            <p>Ground Zeroes had a FANTASTIC PC port, so if two weeks extra is the price to pay for a quality port of Phantom Pain, I can live with that.</p>

            <p>If that were the case they should delay the console versions for those two weeks. The fact that there’s such a small delay but that they’re not just not releasing the games at the same time leads me to believe that that isn’t the case.</p>

            <p>Maybe extra time testing various hardware configurations to make sure it runs smoothly on a variety of computers? Every XBone is going to act like every other XBone, and every PS4 is going to act like every PS4, but there’s really no telling for sure if a PC with an AMD GPU and an Intel CPU is going to work the same way as one with an Nvidia GPU and AMD CPU. Apparently the missing faces on AC:Unity were only on specific cards.</p>

            <p>That’s stupid that there’s a delay but 2 weeks isn’t enough for me to freak out about it. I’m sure I can avoid spoilers for 2 weeks. If it was delayed too much more I was going to rent the Xbone version but I don’t think I’ll bother doing that with such a short delay.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t think such a short delay would net much more console sales though so I wonder what the reason for it is. These delays make no sense to me.</p>
