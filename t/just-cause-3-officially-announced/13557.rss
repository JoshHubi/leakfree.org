            <p>I kind of stopped playing Just Cause 2 after the inane difficulty of losing military attention and the occasional cheap death started to get to me. The game is fun, but what I want to see in the third installment is a more detailed world, which is kind of what they seem to be going for.</p>

            <p>I really hope they give you a better way to escape the local military, though. By about half-way through JC2 anything you did barring a minor traffic infraction would get helicopters on your tail that kept getting reinforcements. The only way to get away from them was to jack one of them and fly as far up as the game would let you until the heat dissipated.<br>
Which took a while, because helicopters kept spawning in and out and whenever one despawned it would get an infinite view distance and mark you out for the system.</p>
<p>Other than that it was hard to find any real complaints about the game. Reused assets and overly similar mission types are understandable considering the game world is the scale of a small country.</p>

            <p>I never can tell whether it’s fighting for a “Just Cause”, or if it’s mindless destruction, explosions and terrorizing of locals, “Just Cause”.</p>
