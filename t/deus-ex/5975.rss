    <description>This thread is for everything Deus Ex.


[b]WTF is Deus Ex?[/SIZE][/b]

Deus Ex is a first person [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk&#39;]cyberpunk[/url] game whereby the main protagonist (JC Denton) uncovers a plot to take over the world. It is set in the near future and blends puzzles, action, stealth and RPG elements such as an inventory and stats. It also has &quot;augmentations&quot; which allow the player to permanently gain new abilities. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest games of all time, and for good reason.





[b]I played that ages ago, won&#39;t it look horrible on modern hardware?[/b][/SIZE]

If anyone is interested in replaying the original Deus Ex without bleeding eyes, the following &quot;mods&quot; can help it be a little more appealing on modern hardware.

[url=&#39;https://kentie.net/article/dxguide/&#39;]This enhanced EXE[/url] will replace the standard deus ex executable, and has some cool features. It is practically required to make Deus Ex run reliably on modern systems, as it fixes Multicore issues, and allows Deus Ex to run in widescreen resolutions. It also allows you to scale the GUI, so that it does not take up 3/4 of the screen and look pixelated.

Got DirectX10? [url=&#39;https://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/&#39;]This little mod[/url] will allow you to run the game using the DirectX 10 renderer. It doesn&#39;t really use any DX10 features, it is mainly designed to make Deus Ex run correctly on modern hardware, however it does have some nice visual features like shiny floors and decent shadows. It also allows the use of High Resolution textures

Only got DirectX9? No worries. [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/games/deus-ex/addons/dues-ex-enb-series-latest&#39;]This ENB Renderer[/url] enhances some of the effects in the engine, and allows use of High Res textures. Because this is not as future poof as the DirectX10 renderer, and has some horrible looking effects occasionally, (however these can be turned off in the INI) I would recommend the DX10 renderer instead.

The [url=&#39;https://www.offtopicproductions.com/hdtp/&#39;]Deus Ex High Definition Texture Pack (HDTP)[/url] is aimed at replacing all models in Deus Ex with much higher quality versions. Only a demo release has been released so far, which only contains a few models. A new version has been promised, but the project looks dead (just like Black Mesa). Oh well, a few nice models is better than none. HDTP likes to hijack your Deus Ex installation, and uses its own EXE. As a result, using the deus EXE above or any of the other renderers will NOT work unless you follow the tutorial below.

[url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-new-vision&#39;]New Vision[/url] is a project designed to replace all the textures in Deus Ex with higher quality versions. It comes with its own OpenGL renderer if you do not wish to use any of the renderers above. These textures will not work with the default Deus Ex renderer.

Lastly, the [url=&#39;https://www.dxm.be/navigator.php5?lang=en&amp;content=202&#39;]Deus Ex Maps Patch[/url] is designed to fix a bug caused by the developers. When they shipped the 1.1 patch, they accidentally &quot;updated&quot; some of the maps to older versions. This patch fixes that problem by replacing them with the 1.0 versions.



-------



How to use HDTP with a decent renderer and high res textures.


1. Install HDTP to an empty folder. Do NOT install it to your Deus Ex folder like the installer tells you to.

2. Open the folder you installed it to.

3. in the system folder, copy everything except for HDTP.ini into your Deus Ex system folder

4. (optional) move the 00_HDTP_Demo.dx file from the maps folder into your Deus Ex maps folder. Doing this will allow you to play a &quot;HDTP DEMO&quot; map using the console. Overrated IMO.

5. inside your HDTP installation folder, go to the HDTP folder (yes, there is a HDTP folder inside your HDTP folder)

6. In this HDTP folder there is a folder called system. Inside that folder is a file called DeusEx.u. Copy this file into your Deus Ex System folder.

7. Inside the HDTP folder there is also a folder called textures. It contains 1 file, HDTPanim.utx. Place this in you Deus Ex Textures folder.

8. HDTP should now be installed. If you get an error when trying to start, or you cannot see any difference in models, then you have not installed HDTP correctly.

            <p>I just got the game recently. I freed that one guy at the bottom of the statue, but he says to go to the top. WHERE IS IT? I went to it and I find two guys talking. There isn’t anything on the floor below it besides a fuckton of guards, and the floor even lower is the place I freed that one guy and stole money from the atm.</p>
<p>You guys know where I am supposed to go?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>You don’t even need to kill Gunther. If you run away from him you can lose him in the castle and finish the game without even talking to him in Paris.</p>

<p>How do you kill Gunther in Paris?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You shoot at him repeatedly?</p>
<p>If you followed a specific plot path, you got given a ‘kill phrase’ by the doctor at UNATCO (again, I forget his name). I believe to get there you had to convince him to stay at UNATCO, whereupon he would leave once getting the kill phrase for you. He would then meet up with you in Paris and give it to you, where you could use it on Gunther.</p>
<p>Or just shoot him in the face with a GEP gun.</p>

<p>“sticks and stones may break my﻿ bones but words will make me self distruct :/”</p>
<p>I’d actually completely forgotten about the killphrases. I’d always killed Anna in the 747 and Gunther in Paris.</p>
