    <title>A big big for the big monster [Video rendering atm]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-big-big-for-the-big-monster-video-rendering-atm/9889</link>
    <description>Not exactly sure what this alien monster is called, but the big guy who guards the tram tracks with the flamethrower arms has a bit of an AI bug. Whenever you run down to the last power supply to zap him to death, if you dont walk into the chamber where your supposed to hit a switch, he spams his flamethrower in that chamber when you are not even there.

Im rendering a video to show a better example, i&#39;ll report when it is uploaded.


edit: Gah I cant edit title names. Them typos  :frowning:</description>
