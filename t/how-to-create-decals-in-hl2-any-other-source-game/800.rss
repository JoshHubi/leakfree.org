    <title>How to create decals in HL2/Any other Source game?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-create-decals-in-hl2-any-other-source-game/800</link>
    <description>Hello there. I&#39;ve always wondered how one might go about creating decals for Half-Life 2 or any other of it&#39;s Source counterparts in Photoshop.

Anyone have a tutorial for me, or be willing to make one for me?

Thanks dudes.</description>
