    <description>Awesome game. I barely remember the old one, but this has been alot of fun. Anyone else here play it?

EDIT: and I can&#39;t believe there isn&#39;t a thread on this already, which leads me to believe there is a thread here that I have managed to miss somewhere.</description>

            <p>Yeah I noticed that. When I’m really focusing I can get some pretty amazing kills and caps, but there are times I can’t even follow a damn route correctly to pick up the speed I need</p>

            <p>I find it’s a come and go sort of skill. There are some games where I just ruin everything and completely carry the team, and there are other games where I’m sitting in a corner chewing on my spinfuzor and drooling.</p>

            <p>As said earlier, the only problem is the few amount of skilled players. Being in top 3 every round after playing for only half an hour feels wrong.</p>

            <p>It’s too bad the vehicles suck. I tried Tribes 2 after playing Ascend and there were way more vehicles and they all seemed to be actually useful, whereas in ascend they are pretty useless. I’m sure that will change eventually though.</p>

            <p>I’ve been playing since early beta( I think there was an Alpha I was in too.) I thought there was already a topic for this.  Also, it’s a great game graphics and gameplay, the best fps f2p imo.</p>

            <p>Tribes is pretty cool, I played it for a while before it hit Steam. Tribes really feels like a faster, futuristic TF2, so it already felt natural and easy to play for me. The majority of the people I played against seemed to be pretty bad though, so teams got stacked pretty easily just because of a couple players. Although I hear that there are some clans/groups that play together, so maybe it’s just getting in a game that has a group playing in it vs. a complete pug.</p>
<p>I need to get the Steam version now. Is it actually integrated with Steam or does it use the same system as before? Also yeah, I think there was an old thread for this…</p>

            <p>It was put on Steam 1-2 weeks ago. It was already very popular, before it was put on it.</p>
<p>Great game, that movement speed feeling is incredible and I like that you need skill for this game.</p>
