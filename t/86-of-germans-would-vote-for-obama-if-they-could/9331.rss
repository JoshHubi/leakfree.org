<p>I totally agree with you, although on that point I should mention that Germany is currently run by the Christian Democrat Party.<br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are fundamental differences between the two cultures and politics of those cultures that makes this comparison a bit of a misframing.</p>
<p>Firstly, it should be said that Obama is a practicing christian. Being religious and holding public office doesn’t make one a theocrat. Angela Merkel clearly isn’t a theocrat.</p>
<p>In the US, there is a significant element in the conservative coalition that seeks to control the government and implement law based on the Old Testament. Within the conservative movement, there is a common creed, “The United States is a Christian nation created by Christian men.”, which is derived from the basic tenet of American Neo-Naziism, “The United States is a White Christian nation created by White  Christian men.”  This isn’t surprising given that the Republican party has bent over backwards to organize the white racist vote in the South, which has been effective, as you can see from an electoral map.</p>
<p>Conservative positions on many issues are derived from the Old Testament or from American Fundamentalist Theology. And that includes economic issues.</p>
<p>We don’t have any real public debate, political discourse, or even communication, because the argumentation is often theological, with one side saying, “The Bible says this, end of story.” And seriously, that’s it.  And because of the nature of American fundamentalist theology, that it’s essentially not a real theology, but rather just taking phrases out of context and stringing them together, there can’t really even be a debate from a theological frame. They’re authoritarians, they’re not serious about theology, it’s just used (abused) to derive authority and justification.</p>
<p>So, there’s no real comparison between Germany and the US in terms of the theocracy issue. One of the central political struggles in the US is for/against real, actual theocracy, which seeks to make all of law and society based on biblical law, as if we live in the bronze age.</p>
<p>Again, for those living outside the US, this may seem like an absurd exaggeration - it absolutely is not.</p>
<p>There are other differences between the two countries politically and culturally that makes comparison of the political systems a false equivalency, but it’s enough just to address the theocracy aspect. When people talk about theocracy in the US, they’re talking about real religious law, derived from a mythology that God has chosen the United States to be blessed with His grace, and that we must live by His word in law and society, like some Islamic states that impose Sharia.</p>

<p>I’m from Spain, so go figure. I live in a country in which Catholicism has had an enormous influence in the culture. And the Popular Party, the right-wing Christian Party, is on the government right now. It’s one of the most religious countries in Europe, behind extremists like Poland, Portugal, Greece, Turkey (not in the EU, but still Europe, more or less) and a few others.</p>
<p>Even then, we’ve got a 70% Catholic population and going down, with a growing 25% of non-believers and an even bigger population of those who support laïcité (secularism, the separation of church and state.) And you wouldn’t know it’s a majorly religious country; nobody goes to Church, except old people, children and Latin-American immigrants. Spain is no Norway, Sweden or Denmark on these matters, but even such a traditionally religious country is SO far from the frankly alarming notoriety of religion in the USA.</p>
<p>I mean… Americans, you’ve got “In God we Trust” printed in your money since the fifties, because of the Red Fear, and back then you also changed the wording of your pledge of allegiance to include God. Which is funny, because it substituted the sentence that established the very point of your country: now it’s “one nation under god” instead of “one nation indivisible.” I just can’t fathom how could you let such theocratic bullshit taint the country that once was the most secular of them all.</p>
<p>Rants aside, I understand why Germans, and Europeans in general, would vote for Obama. For our standards, he’s a centrist, even right-wing in economic matters, although on social issues he’s on par with European liberals (in aspirations at least). So he’s pretty much someone who could be voted by leftists and right-wingers too. Only a very small minority would vote for the current, Tea Party-led Republican Party -they are obsessed with reducing taxes for the richest (Trickle-down economics, what a joke), denying science (I mean, Creationism? Global warming? Come on, we’re not in the 19th Century/80’s respectively.) and denying rights (women’s rights, gay’s rights, immigrants, etc.)</p>
<p>Where did the Old Republican party go? Europeans WOULD have voted for that party. But it’s not the same party. Consider this: the Republicans would consider many of Reagan’s policies to be “SOCIALIST!”, a very bad word indeed, because apparently they still live in the 50’s and haven’t heard of the difference between dictatorial communism and social-democracy. And those who know the difference don’t care: “Yeah, if we allow universal healthcare and government regulating business, one thing leads to another and PUM, by next week we’re on Maoist China.” These ones haven’t heard of the “Slippery-Slope” logical fallacy, apparently.</p>
<p>And Libertarians… come on, they don’t even exist around here. And thank God for that. A few years with those anarco-capitalists and Europe would go to shit. Capitalism works, if it doesn’t go crazy. Anarchism (lack of governance) is the definition of craziness.</p>

<p>The American system is an interesting paradox.  It’s a country which claims to hold the principles of freedom above all things and yet it doesn’t allow gays to marry and has politicians who are against women being allowed to make their own choices in life (what I would class as a very serious breach of their personal freedom)<br>
So basically, America stands for freedom, but only if you are a white male who has an income of over $50k per year.</p>
<p>*I should clarify that I know that some states do allow gay marriage.  But if the Republicans get back in you can say bye bye to that freedom.</p>
<p>The reason Europeans love Obama is that he doesn’t go around messing around in our countries.  Bush wasn’t intent on just fucking up America, he also wanted to fuck up everywhere else.  Obama is happy to just piss in his own pool and not piss in ours.  Condoleezza Rice was a disgusting human being and completely incapable of performing her role and absolutely killed foreign relations with pretty much every country she went to.  Her arrogance really managed to piss off a lot of people.<br>
I think only Mitt Romney could do worse than she did.</p>

<p>You have to consider that the German (and in most parts the European) society differs from the American in many ways. The American libertarianism is something many people here have problems with. Not even the most liberal party in Germany would dare to question universal health care, no respected politician in Germany would speak open about “patriotism” and many of the debates in American internal politics seem like a joke to Germans and Europeans (creationism in schools, social security, gay rights etc.). “Defending your country”, “having a strong military”, “being a better country than all the others” are concepts that will alienate Germans strongly, especially after our history. Germany’s economy is a social market economy with huge interference and control from the Government, so of course Germans would vote for an American politician that comes closer to the system that they are used to than other candidates. Even the most conservative politician in Germany would be considered a left wing socialist by American standards. And vice versa if Barack Obama would have held his DNC speech with the same words here in Germany, he would’ve been politically dead and branded as right wing fascist.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Germans and Americans are different people.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, here in Europe Libertarians are considered crazy. As they should. They are basically market-anarchists. Economics just do not agree with their mantra that no regulation would result in a prosperous society.</p>
<p>The fact that Americans are still arguing issues such as women’s rights (including not only abortion but also contraception), gay rights, universal healthcare, creationism (anywhere at all would be bad enough, but especially in schools!) and the separation of church and state… it’s just unbelievable. They may be the wealthiest country (although not for very long now, if China goes on as it is predicted by many and if Europe is eventually considered a country) with the most powerful military, but in social issues they are still in the 19th Century.</p>

<p>That’s just about the dumbest fucking thing I’ve ever heard. it’s hard for Obama when the republicans shit on and forcibly try and block every single thing he wants to change. Let me guess you’re all going to vote for that dipshit Romney just because he’s the latest thing and then you’re all going to jump off the bandwagon and kick him out when he proves that he is infact a fucking idiot. Obama will have a lot more power in his second term. If he’s re elected he will go down in history as a great president along with Clinton, Abe and the rest of them.</p>

            <p>Strictly on topic: It definitely doesn’t help that the most recent republican was Bush, there’s probably a bit of a stigma to being associated with him</p>
<p>Rant-y digression:<br>
I don’t usually like to get involved with political discussions, but back in September 2009, Obama was going to have a speech, you can read it here <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks</a> or just google the video.</p>
<p>The point of the speech was essentially to tell kids to stay in school and do their best at it. As soon as it was announced that he would be doing the speech, a bunch of the crazies in the republican party started talking about how the speech would be used to indoctrinate your children.</p>
<p>The school I went to at the time was going to show the speech. In the preceding days, so many people called into the school and complained that the school cancelled the entire thing.<br>
The point of this entire message is yes, idiots on both sides will always imagine things, but it definitely isn’t equal, and that was in north west Indiana, about an hour away from Chicago.</p>
<p>I don’t like to be called democrat, because I don’t necessarily agree with some of the ideas that go along with that statement. But I’m certainly more of a democrat than a republican<br>
[/SIZE]<br>
And before anyone comments, I do know that a similar thing happened with George Bush (sr) in 1991.[/SIZE]<br>

<p>Well, that is it.</p>
<p>These political parties exist to win elections and he’s not their guy. Republicans also hated Clinton for the same reason and bitched and moaned about every single thing he did.</p>
<p>And, the Republican party has used the Southern Strategy successfully since the late 60s. The largest electoral shift in American history was the shift of white Southern racist from the Democratic to the Republican party after the Dems supported the Voting Rights Act of 1964 and The Civil Rights Act of 1965. There’s a well-known political cliche from that period, “I didn’t leave the democratic party, the democratic party left me”.</p>
<p>The Republican narrative since then has been overtly racist, as well as their wedge issues, like affirmative action, welfare reform, State’s Right’s, Law &amp; Order. This can clearly be seen on any electoral map where you see all these Southern states in red.</p>
<p>I’m really surprised that you would think that the idea that racism plays a role in the opposition to Obama isn’t a serious proposition.</p>

<p>I really don’t think that’s a caricature. That is honestly how many Republicans feel. If you aren’t Republican, they have no desire to listen to a word you have to say.</p>

            <p>What I’d like to know is what Obama himself specifically did that the right has a problem with.  Not some fantasy cartoon caricature of Obama as this evil America-hating “socialist” (from people who don’t even know what “socialism” is) but actual policies that Obama pushed for that the right has a problem with.</p>
<p>To this date, I haven’t seen any actual responses to this.  I have seen a lot of claims that are patently false, but nothing actually accurate.</p>

            <p>Bush was the right guy to be in office during the Sept 11 attacks. He brought the nation back together after that (and any americans here who can’t remember how bad it felt are lying to themselves). He shouldn’t have been re-elected though. He was surely a 1-term president. That said, Bush did serve two terms, and while we can’t pin this whole mess we’re in now on Pres Bush (it goes back way further than that, 50+ years), he is partly to blame thanks to putting us deep into a that war that we didn’t belong in. Now it’s really up to each individual to decide if Obama’s had enough time to try to clean up our mess and he needs to go, or if his presidential policies should be granted some more time to kick in. It’s a really tough decision, and it’s why the country is divided nearly 50/50.</p>

            <p>Conservatism is Burke, who responded to Paine’s The Right’s of Man Part First by bringing charges of sedition. Paine had already left to join Jefferson in France, but was prosecuted and tried in absentia for sedition.</p>
<p>Conservatism opposes democracy. The philosophy itself arose as an opposing reaction to the implementation of democracy in the United States previously, and to the threat of democracy displacing monarchy in France, which both Paine and Jefferson supported.</p>
<p>Conservatism is the idea that social stability can only come when the ignorant majority are governed through a minority of hereditary aristocracy. It relies on an idea Burke called ‘hereditary wisdom’, which basically says that ignorance and wisdom, rationality and irrationality, civility and incivility are hereditary traits that run through family blood lines. That some humans are born to ability to use logic and reason and others are not, that some humans are born civilized and others not and can not learn civility, but can only be governed by those who are.</p>
<p>In other words, ‘the people’ are hereditarily incapable of self-governance because they are uncivilized and irrational, and can only be governed by a hereditary aristocracy. And so the mechanics of law must insure the inheritance of wealth, land, power, and title, in order to maintain that a noble class should always govern, lest civilization, society, and nation collapse.</p>
<p>That’s conservatism is a nutshell.</p>
<p>Paine and Jefferson disagreed with conservatism, of course, and when Paine published the Part first of The Rights of Man while in England in 1791 as an opposing response to Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France, Burke, an MP, charged him with sedition - that’s how much respect the founder of conservatism had for freedom of speech and of the press. The very idea of democracy, expressed publicly was a crime to Burke.</p>
