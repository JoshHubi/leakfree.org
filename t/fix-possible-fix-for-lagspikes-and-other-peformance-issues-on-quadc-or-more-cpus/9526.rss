<p>Are you kidding me ?!<br>
So you had no stuttering issues like people with even better rigs ?<br>
For example if you shoot the Magnum after some Loading/new level you dont get a second stuttering ?<br>
Go ahead and proof your statement, record a short video and upload it.<br>
Otherwise you just lie… or your 2 lazy to recognize stuttering …<br>
I watched like 10 Lets play videos and all had this stuttering issue.</p>
<p>Do you even know what “stuttering” is and what we are talking about here ?</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m running a Phenom II 965 Black w/8GBs of 12800 high yield and a pair of Radeon 5750 with a RAID. I’m getting mouse shudder unless I do the affinity fix. I’m running Windows 8 64.</p>
<p>I’ve waited to play my copy of Half-Life until this mod was finished. That is well over 5 years…</p>
<p>My first PC (I built) was a 486DX with a CL 1MB VLB Adapter. My HD was 20MB. I was almost 10. I set jumpers by hand and had to build my drivers using the ICU after dialing into Sound Blaster’s BBS to download drivers. I was able to run SimCity 2000 and WfW3.11 with no room to spare on that bad boy and I am as happy now as I was then.</p>
<p>I respectfully suggest you leave the grandstanding elsewhere because computers are very different and SDKs for each terminal can vary incredibly based on how they are compiled individually with the present driver set. I have practically the same specs as the gentleman/woman you are attempting to shame and I find your attitude to not be helping us here in the least. If you are feeling froggy, why not volunteer your time to translate debugs for the devs? I’m sure you can help them optimize their calls better than any of us; including the two of us you are insulting who directly have 50+ combined years <span class="bbcode-i">alone</span> diagnosing and JOYFULLY debugging software (EVEN FREE SOFTWARE LIKE THIS, I MIGHT ADD).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have mostly fixed the stuttering using a brute force approach.  When I dl’ed BMS I was using a Q6600 quad @ 2.5ghz and it stuttered badly.  I have changed to an AMD FX8350 @ 4ghz and while running much higher graphic settings the FPS is 100% higher and the stuttering is gone.<br>
Except for Surface Tension Uncut.  There is still bad FPS and stuttering there.  I am experimenting with overclocking and at 4.6ghz the stuttering is almost gone, and at the part with the Gargantua where I used to get 10FPS I am now getting 50FPS.<br>
So it seems that brute force is the only solution unless the developers optimize BMS better.</p>

            <p>This solution appeared to work at first, but failed shortly thereafter.  I doubt it, but I wonder if it could be attributable to having loaded a saved game (since such sw and hw matters should/would be mutually exclusive).</p>

            <p>I just noticed something! I apologize if this has already been mentioned!</p>
<p>When I look at the task manager, there is one core (CPU 0 I believe) that is constantly maxed out. The rest are just kinda… doing a teeny, tiny bit. As expected, this is the same case when changing the affinity to use only CPU 0.</p>
<p>Here’s the interesting thing. When I change the affinity back to using all 4 cores, the CPU usage is now distributed almost evenly among each core! I am going to test it a bit more, but I was not getting frame drops in places I normally would! Could this be a bug? Well, maybe not a bug… but it’s definitely odd to me.</p>
<p>Mat_queue mode is still set to -1 after resetting the affinity, so it doesn’t <span class="bbcode-i">seem</span> to be changing that somehow… I haven’t seen any crashes yet either, and I usually get them quite consistently when using mat_queue 2.</p>
<p>*update</p>
<p>I’ve found that this works with No More Room in Hell!</p>

<p>I had an incredible fps drop there, from 100+ to 7fps while I was with that monster.</p>
<p>BUT I’ve tested many of the suggestions here (affinity changes does nothing in my case) but looking into the “cmd mat_queue_mode” I’ve found this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"mat_queue_mode" = "2" ( def. "-1" )
- The queue/thread mode the material system should use: 
 1=default, 
 0=synchronous single thread, 
 1=queued single thread, 
[U][B] 2=queued multithreaded[/B][/U]</code></pre>
<p>I set that command to 2 and now I have 60+ FPS in that level and I don’t have any FPS drop anymore, BUT it comes with a price.<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">Setting this to 2 (queued multithreaded) causes random crashes</span>, only use it where you see you are having a hugh fps drop and makes it unplayable.</p>
<p>r_dynamiclightning 0 also helped me a few times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Long story short, I ended up moving my D-DRIVE\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS folder to my SSD at something like C-DRIVE\BMS (stopping/closing steam first obviously)</p>
<p>After doing this, I created a Symbolic link from my D Drive (Wester Digital Green Drive) to my SSD so that I could keep my current steam configuration and try hosting the resources on a more responsive hard-drive. This seemed to work very well, it loads a lot quicker this way anyways and I haven’t experienced the glitches at all anymore and I run on full settings.</p>
<p>Here’s a link talking about NTFS symbolic links: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link</a></p>
<p>I ran a command like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mklink /D D:\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS C:\BMS</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t know what a symbolic link is, you need to pretty much have Vista or Windows 7 for this to work. The above command creates a special type of shortcut that allows the one drive to point to the space on another drive (or even just the same drive). As long as they are both NTFS partitions, it should work fine. Steam loads it super well. It’s a handy trick to make games load faster as you’re playing them, then you can jump into command line (cmd) and run a RMDIR command on the D-DRIVE\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS command and move the C-DRIVE\BMS folder back there.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">It’s almost like a tunnel to the information. So, if I click on the “shortcut” in the D-DRIVE\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods folder entitled “BMS” the filesystem thinks that the files in this directory are still on the D-Drive, so it keeps that path when you click on it, but they are really on the C-DRIVE\ in this case.</span></p>
<p>Does that help anyone? I would venture to guess if someone is running on a slow hard-drive they could be experiencing similar problems which isn’t necessarily Memory/CPU/GPU issues if it’s reading from ~7 GB of information for resources.<br>

</aside>
<p>I have pretty much the same hard drive setup as you. I tried to do this with normal windows 7 shortcuts, but steam doesnt understand them</p>
<p>I understand the “mklink /D D\Steam…” part, but how do i actually create the symbolic link?</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Edit:<br>
Dont worry i got it sorted, you have to type this into command prompt to create the link.</p>

            <p>Every time i’ve played BMS the first kill in the game provides a very strange lag. (caused by gibs/physics ?)<br>
And it is only by killing an enemy and only the first one!</p>
<p>My System are:</p>
<p>Asus M4A78-EM<br>
AMD Phenom II X4 940<br>
HD5770 1GB DDR5 RAM (driver 12.1)<br>
4 GB DDR2-800 RAM<br>
Windows 7 Ultimate x64</p>
<p>I’ve used these commands in autoexec.cfg but it didn’t work for me!</p>
<p><code>mem_max_heapsize "3000"
cl_forcepreload "1"
snd_mix_async "1
snd_async_fullyasync "1"
mat_queue_mode "0"
r_dynamiclighting "0"</code></p>
<p>I’ve changed heapsize to every number, the sound settings from 2 Speakers to 7.1, the Affinity to Core 2, 3 and 4<br>
(used Windows Taskmanager, WinLauncherXP, CPU-Control)<br>
but it has no effect in the game!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=‘Red’]–EDIT–</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Okay new information …<br>
the lags occur only when I select a resolution, which is not 4 : 3</span></p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">And now even the right Multi-Core commands, god damn!</span></span></p>
<p>mat_queue_mode -1/0/1/2<br>
threads 1/2/3/4<br>
snd_mix_async 1<br>
r_threaded_renderables 1<br>
r_threaded_particles 1<br>
ai_expression_optimization 1</p>
<p>(Optional)<br>
cl_forcepreload 1<br>
sv_forcepreload 1</p>
<p>I don’t know who said mat_qeue_mode must set to 0.<br>
If someone has a Multi Core CPU, you have to use -1 (game use system defaults)<br>
0 uses synchronous single thread, 1 uses queued single threaded mode,<br>
and value of 2 (caused crashes) uses multi-threaded mode.</p>

            <p>Changed audio from stereo to 7.1 and that fixed the lag for the last scene for me.<br>
I have stereo speakers and 7.1 surround hooked at the same time.<br>
mat_queue_mode 0 also seemed to help.</p>

<p>Oh with delight I do that on &lt;Cybertrance’s&gt; behalf:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw-0W_jf_TU" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw-0W_jf_TU</a></p>
<p>my rig (on which the video was recorded):<br>
AMD Phenom II X2 550@3.42 GHz<br>
Zotac GTX260<br>
8 GIG of RAM</p>
<p>BM-Settings:<br>
4xFXAA<br>
16xAniIso<br>
Blur: disabled (i hate blur, so it’s off, but it might also be a reason for stuttering, didn’t test that)<br>
Hdr: on (when possible)</p>
<p>see … i’ve been programming games, game engines and core-junk around games for almost the last 20 years now. There are many things in BlackMesa that don’t work as they should or are glitchy or whatever.</p>
<p>In nearly ALL cases the reason is the underlying SourceEngine, and just to be clear: BlackMesa did an incredible job dealing with it. And also to be clear: the SourceEngine is nevertheless a beautiful engine.</p>
<p>I realize that one of the most aggravating things you can encounter, when you have a problem with software is that other users jump up and wave “not here, matey!”. They maybe try to be supportive to the guys who gave us this masterpiece, or they might try to tell to you that maybe some config has gone awry.</p>
<p>I do not expect that the average gamer understands every technical reason for every problem, but - in case the video above was what you wanted to see - I only expect you to show some Gentleman-ship and apologize to &lt;Cybertrance’s&gt; for your <em>cough</em> statements.</p>
<p>Addendum:<br>
Forgot to mention, when dealing with lags and cpu-spikes, pls always make sure your taskbar isn’t laden with all the “friendly” apps, that gather there over time.<br>
a) kill all messengers like Skype, YM, ICQ … before playing (if you can on don’t need them for team-speak)<br>
those can be unpredictable CPU-hogs, especially when you have plugins installed.<br>
b) kill every friggin updater, push service cr**, and cloud synchronizers while you play (restart them afterwards if you must)<br>
c) “park” or pause all “heavy weight” anti-virus proggies<br>
only prog i have found to not interfere in the slightest is MSE. then again: don’t really test other packages as I hated Symantec already when it was still called Norton.<br>
maybe it helps - ciao</p>

            <p>For the lazy ones: There’s a tool that I know from Thief II (also some beef with multi CPU), called WinLauncherXP.</p>
<p>find it at MajorGeeks: <a href="https://www.majorgeeks.com/download870.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.majorgeeks.com/download870.html</a></p>
<p>Adding a config =&gt; <a href="https://i1278.photobucket.com/albums/y515/bbsiteuser/winlaunch01_zpsb862257d.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">see here</a></p>

Steam users just place the image-path for “steam.exe” others the image page to “hl2.exe”</p>
<p>core affinity =&gt; <a href="https://i1278.photobucket.com/albums/y515/bbsiteuser/winlaunch03_zpsc4f53717.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">see here</a></p>
<p>If you have to rely on commandline options than you might encouter probs. In this case you’ll have to alt-tab out. Cheers</p>

Otherwise you just lie… or your 2 lazy to recognize stuttering …<br>

<p>Im surprised at the number of issues people are having.  I’ve had ZERO problems, only fps dropping to about 40 during QE which I think is simply due to the level of detail the developers achieved.  My specs:</p>
<p>Q6600 OCed to 3.6<br>
4 GB RAM<br>
Radeon 5800</p>
<p>I also experienced no performance changes when adjusting affinity/cores for BM.  Unless I disabled cores of course.</p>

            <p>Jesus, no there is no way to fix this now, Valve need to fix Source SDK 2007 or release a new version.</p>

            <p>So is there a way to run BMS with an i7 3770k without the stuttering issues ?<br>
I hate these damn lags at the beginning of new levels and events.</p>

<p>Get into task manager.<br>

Find the hl2.exe process.<br>
Right click &gt; Set Affinity… &gt; select all cores but one</p>

<p>Alternatively, download <a href="https://www.robpol86.com/images/Imagecfg.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.robpol86.com/images/Imagecfg.zip</a>, extract it to<br>
&lt;&gt;\steamapps&lt;&gt;\source sdk base 2007<br>
where &lt;&gt; is your steam account name</p>
<p>Open command line interpreter, cmd.exe, then use “cd” command, for example you have steam installed on F:<br>
(press Enter)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd /d f:\steam\steamapps\&lt;&lt;username&gt;&gt;\source sdk base 2007</code></pre>
<p>Now we are ready to set process affinity mask value:<br>
(press Enter)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[B]F:\Steam\steamapps\&lt;&lt;username&gt;&gt;\source sdk base 2007&gt;[/B]imagecfg -a [COLOR='Lime']0xE hl2.exe</code></pre>
<p>if you have:<br>
[b]- 3 cores, use 0x6</p>
<ul>
<li>4 cores, use 0xE[/b]</li>
<li>5 cores, use 0x1E<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">- 6 cores, use 0x3E</span>
</li>
<li>7 cores, use 0x7E<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">- 8 cores, use 0xfe</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From now on, hl2.exe process (from source sdk base 2007) should use all CPU cores but CPU0</p>
<p>To revert changes, just delete hl2.exe file or validate “SDK Base 2007” cache files.</p>
