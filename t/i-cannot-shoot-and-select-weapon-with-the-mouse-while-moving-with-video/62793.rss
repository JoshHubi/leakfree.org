    <description>As New Xen update came out, I started a new game from chapter 14 and I encountered an issue.
I am not able to shoot and select weapon using a mouse while moving, I have to stand still to shoot.
but if I replaced my primary attack button to one of the keyboard buttons then it works as demonstrated within the video below

NOTE: the issue is not the mouse, because I used a different mouse and still same result
I even re-installed the game, I am also using a laptop the same laptop where I played this game before and it was working fine</description>
