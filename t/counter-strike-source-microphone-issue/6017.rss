            <p>Don’t play jailbreak or what the heck it is. From what I’ve heard on there, they are all annoying 12 year olds. So, because you’re playing jailbreak too, I’m assuming you are also 12 years old.<br>
Why did you even ask your mum to buy this game if you’re not going to play it properly?</p>
