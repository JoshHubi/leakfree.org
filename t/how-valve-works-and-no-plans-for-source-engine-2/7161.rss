    <description>There is no such thing as too many Valve threads.

If someone is interested in it, [url=&#39;https://www.develop-online.net/features/1184/The-Valve-manifesto&#39;]this article[/url]shows how Valve actually works, and how it is to work at them.

[url=&#39;https://www.develop-online.net/news/37672/Valve-No-existing-plan-for-Source-Engine-2?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+developmag%2Fifbh+%28Develop%29&#39;]This article shows[/url], that Valve won&#39;t make a new engine that fast, they will still work with the Source Engine, but upgrade it. Like they always did, with their new games.

Here are some more interesting interviews:

            <p>L.A.'s system is good for 1:1 facial animation but I’m sure it could be much better if it could be used in conjunction with a real-time animation system.</p>
<p>Hell, even the pre-recorded footage is excellent to improve the fidelity of a real-time system.</p>
<p>My biggest problem with L.A. Noire is that the character artists apparently were unable to tweak the eyes and mouth have the proper geometric depth.</p>
<p>The eyes and mouth of the characters in that game look flat and that, for me, makes it look even more like they superimposed video over their faces.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Yeah that’s the big downfall of L.A. Noir’s system, its not actually animation so it isn’t as flexible. Flexibility is something that it seems like Valve likes to have in their engines.</p>

            <p>“When we developed Left 4 Dead 2, that was essentially an experiment in the company. We were saying, ‘hey, let’s optimise for time and see what happens’. We showed we could do it.”</p>
<p>So, there was an actual explanation for L4D2’s quick release. That’s very interesting actually.</p>

<p>Garry Newman has done stuff with Left 4 Dead 1 and 2. They are now mountable in his mod. He has not made Portal 2 mountable yet, but it is just a matter of time.</p>
<p>All Valve games since Left 4 Dead has used dead end engines. Left 4 Dead 2’s engine is different from Left 4 Dead 1’s.</p>
