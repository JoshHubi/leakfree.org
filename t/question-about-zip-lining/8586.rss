    <title>Question About Zip Lining</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/question-about-zip-lining/8586</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to go zip lining for my [u] ? [/u]1st birthday in about three weeks and I have a question for those who&#39;ve actually been zip lining before.

Do you have to apply pressure utilizing your shoulders or, is it simply pressure from your hands that is needed? I&#39;m asking because I have a torn rotator cuff on my right side and I&#39;m wondering if I will actually need to use it for anything more than simply guidance. I can put up with the pain for short periods but don&#39;t know if I could handle having to do it for long periods.

Any advice?</description>

            <p>I have been ziplining recently, and no it does not rely too much on your arms. I think you should be fine.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure any health and safety board would disbar those things if someone falling unconscious midway had any high chance of death.</p>
<p>YouTube is an amazing resource though, and I’m sure you could find a tutorial video of someone setting up the harness. It could always be somewhat different, but you may get an idea of the basics and what to watch out for with your injury. Also mention it to the instructor who sets you up.</p>

            <p>They had a zipline in Vegas down the length of Freemont Street the last time I was there. Harnesses all around. The first group of people I saw on it had the most fun with it, screaming the entire length of the line, hands waving maniacally. It looked awesome. I almost wish I had done it that day.</p>

            <p>Yeah, all the ziplines I’ve been on have been harnesses, similar to a rock-climbing harness. You could even hang upside down if you wanted to. You don’t have to hang from a handle by your arms or anything like that, you should be good.</p>

            <p>Bloodshot, I believe that you’re right. I’ve only been zip lining once and it was when I was younger but it was on a harness and when in the harness you only use your arms to hold yourself upright. Not too shoulder intensive but if there’s time, depending on your weight I’d ask someone better qualified in the field of medicine.</p>

            <p>I thought the ziplines suspended you like a sort of harness seat so you didn’t have to hold on with your arms that much.</p>
<p>I’ve just seen videos though.</p>
