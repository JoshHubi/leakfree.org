    <title>Garry&#39;s Mod- Issues with Goremod</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/garrys-mod-issues-with-goremod/8096</link>
    <description>I recently installed goremod, and I think something has gone horribly wrong. I&#39;m getting all of these lua errors, then it lags, and then it disconnects me IN SINGLEPLAYER. Here&#39;s my console

[addons\dismemberment mod 1.9\lua\autorun\client\cl_goremod.lua:10] attempt to index local &#39;bone_matrix&#39; (a nil value)[/SIZE]



What&#39;s going on? I think [addons\dismemberment mod 1.9\lua\autorun\client\cl_goremod.lua:10] attempt to index local &#39;bone_matrix&#39; (a nil value) is important because it repeats itself ad infinitum. 

Is there something I can do to fix this?</description>

            <p>That game is touchy when it comes to certain mods. I once wasted about 4 hours of my life building this huge base full of wired doors and contraptions and when i loaded it back up the next day i got a screen full of blue text and none of my contraptions would work. I only had a few simple sweps, guns, and models installed too. This has happened several times in the past.</p>
<p>I just uninstalled and am not even going to consider reinstalling it.</p>
