            <p>Hello, I am a 3-d animator, and while I’d like to mostly work on redoing the view-models currently in the Steam version, I can also do character animation if you all need. I am very experienced in Source compiling, so I can compile anything you all need.</p>
<p>My Youtube where I post a lot of animation-related videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MyZombiekillerz/videos" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/user/MyZombiekillerz/videos</a></p>
<p>My Steam Workshop is filled with animations for Source games: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/MzKSteam/myworkshopfiles/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/id/MzKSteam/myworkshopfiles/</a></p>
<p>I realize the game is a tad dead at the moment, but I was thinking that the animations I do could come out along with the Xen update (that might happen…?), so people would be coming back at that point. Please reply whether you think I’m capable or not.</p>

<p>Bump. We’re still looking for a great animator!</p>
<p>We’re particularly interested in animators who are good with viewmodels (weapons) and character animation. We’re overhauling the weapon animations, but we want to hire someone who can animate other things too.</p>
<p>If you know a great animator, please send them our way, too. We would be very grateful!</p>

            <p>I hope there will still be open place for animator until start of next year.<br>
Would really like to apply. But not sure if I will have time till end of this year due to work and stuff.</p>
<p>Half Life 1 holds some of my greatest childhood memories, and I was playing Half Life 1 Deathmatch for years with my friends as a kid.</p>
<p>Came back to this forum after getting HL1 Deathmatch. And was researching into HD version of it. Sadly, no  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  .<br>
But seems like great Black Mesa team is working on one.</p>
