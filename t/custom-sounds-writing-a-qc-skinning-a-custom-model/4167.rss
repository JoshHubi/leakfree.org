    <title>Custom sounds/writing a QC/Skinning a Custom model</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/custom-sounds-writing-a-qc-skinning-a-custom-model/4167</link>
    <description>How would one put custom sounds into a the hammer sound selector? I want to have an intercom voice that goes off when a power generator is shut down or turned on, and I would really hate to go with a text message in the center of the screen. 

As a second question, how do you write a QC file? I am also working on a Sourceified version of the final level of Super Mario 64 and have a Bob-omb model all set up in Google Sketch up and exported, but how do i write a QC?

How would a skin be made for said Bob-omb? I can have a purple/black checkerboard thing laying around.

AND LASTLY.... how do i get the HL2 EP2 specific entities in HL2? thank you in advance, to anyone who can help.

Edit: I&#39;ve Tried [url]https://developer.valvesoftware.com/[/url] and couldn&#39;t find anything. that site is a pain in the ass.</description>
