    <title>Can&#39;t start BMS</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-start-bms/10566</link>
    <description>Hey. When i try to start BMS i get black screen and very soon after it appears it closes. The game seemed to be working yesterday tho. Also it doesn&#39;t produce any dump. Any ideas what can be wrong? I reinstalled SDK base and BMS itself, but still it won&#39;t work.</description>
