    <title>Steam Greenlight. A chance for BM on Steam?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-greenlight-a-chance-for-bm-on-steam/9020</link>
    <description>Look at this:
[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/&#39;]https://steamcommunity.com/greenlight/[/url]
Basicly it says anyone can put his game on a voting list called Steam Greenlight. Users will then vote for it to get it on Steam or not. The game doesn&#39;t have to be finished to be on Greenlight. The service starts at August.

If the games posted on Greenlight can be free to play there is no restriciton for Black Mesa to be put on Steam.</description>

            <p>Continuing the trend, it’s at 44% now. Slowly getting closer and closer. I’m wondering how many votes it actually takes, though… Does it say anywhere?</p>
<p>EDIT: Looks like BM has been greenlit. Woohoo!</p>

            <p>41% is easily the highest I’ve seen on Greenlight, I think they should decrease the votes though, I can’t even imagine how many people have voted and it’s not even half way there.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t get this percentage thing. 18% of what? Why can’t they just write “300 out of the required 2000 votes reached” or something?</p>
<p>And how many votes do they even need? I mean, for Black Mesa, I’m pretty sure it will get more votes than anything else, and if even that’s not enough, then their system is very unrealistic…</p>

            <p>I still find it a tiny bit annoying that a game such as Black Mesa has to go through this formality to be able to get into Steam. It will be, after all, the only good remake of HL1, and HL is still one of the defining games of Steam.</p>

            <p>i just saw the new update that you have to pay 100$ to upload a game on greenlight, (maybe becouse of abuses?). did someone pay from bms team, or they uploaded it on greenlight before the update?</p>

            <p>Why is this not being done?</p>
<p>There’s 9 days left.  People could make a huge push using facebook and make this the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> voted game on this new greenlight thing.</p>
<p>There are tons of user mods on there now, Cry of Fear, a bunch.</p>
<p>WHERE’S BMS AT?  Its the perfect feather in the cap for your final media push.</p>
