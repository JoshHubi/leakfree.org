    <title>Pink checkerboards and DirectX stuck at 7</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pink-checkerboards-and-directx-stuck-at-7/13123</link>
    <description>I suddenly began seeing pink squares in various places, some textures are replaced completely, some are just overlayed by it. Sometimes in the main menu random wireframes appeared and the scientist&#39;s coats are overlayed with repeating bloodstains.
 I tried to set launch parameters to dxlevel 90 and 98, but the video settings are set to default and resolution to the smallest. Applying any new options will make the hardware DirectX say 7.0 and the bugs appear again. 
I did a clean reinstall with no effect. 
PC Specs: nVidia GeForce GTX 650Ti, i7 920, 6GB Ram, DX11 and Windows7 64bit.

            <p>Now the problem seems to be gone. I updated the nvidia drivers to the latest but that alone did not solve anything. Then i reinstalled Source SDK 2007 and Half Life 2 and the problems are gone, at least for the menu and the first level of the game.</p>

            <p>Black and pink checkers means the game is looking for a texture and not finding it. So you either messed up some texture folders or have driver issues. So check your folders.</p>

            <p>This is not a bug in Black Mesa, so this is the correct place to post this thread.  I have closed the other thread (which is in the section for bugs).</p>
<p>I believe that this is caused by a problem with your video card, not Black Mesa.  Have you made sure that your drivers are up to date?</p>
