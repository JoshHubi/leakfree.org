<p>Tax day 09, if I remember correctly. It didn’t get covered by Fox News</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The thing is, the “tax day tea party” thing in 09 was the beginning of the astroturf rallies. They were organized by GOP political machinery as I’ve described earlier in this thread. Sure, with the anti-health-care rallies this year, FOX and Republican officeholders got directly involved, but they were only taking advantage of a movement which was created in '09 by GOP funding for that purpose.</p>

            <p>I’m curious Kenny, when and where was the “one of the first tea party rallies” that you attended? Because when you say it isn’t “a extension of the Republicans,” you have to understand that the rallies themselves were kickstarted by GOP operatives and then organized from the start by a PAC headed by a former GOP Majority Leader. The only tea party rallies that were not connected to the GOP establishment were the pro-Ron Paul rallies during the election, and I’m not 100% they were even physical rallies rather than online fundraising.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Speaking as someone who actually attended one of the first rallies for the Tea Parties, my two cents is that the reason everyone’s hating on the party is because the GOP has thrown too many of their biggest names in with the party. It’s not supposed to be a extension of the Republicans, because when you think about it the GOP screwed us over just as much as the Democrats.</p>
<p>Earlier in the thread, I noted that someone posted that the founding fathers would roll in their graves at what’s being done in their name. The same applies to both pollitical parties, really. The baseline American, someone who isn’t a party activist, someone who values their country and their freedoms, are the core of the Tea Party movement. Or at least, they used to be. As they say, “absolute power corrupts absolutely,” and I’m guessing that the tea party will wind up being corrupted from the top down, and as a result there will be no true voice for middle America as a whole.</p>
<p>CatzEyes, I’m with you on this one. The Tea Party’s been on the receiving end of a huge amount of unjustified bile lately. We can hope that the Republicans will field a decent candidate in 2012, but that’s less likely than the Mayan apocalypse theory becoming a reality. I guess my take on the controversy is that we all lost something when the Tea Party movement got derailed.</p>
<p>But before you call the tea party racist, a “no one is illegal” rally actually moved through our group, as if they were trying to pick a fight. Thankfully there was no conflagration, because we all kept our heads. Plus, there were forty cops in riot gear standing across the street and getting into a riot in front of Barbra Simpson (the radio talk show host, she spoke at the rally) would have made the whole movement look bad.</p>
<p>But as some prior picture postings indicated, there are plenty of idiots affiliated with the movement that will do that for me.</p>
<p>Point being, this is a truly depressing time to be a center right voter.</p>

</aside>
<p>Pretending <span class="bbcode-b">not </span>to be republicans, that’s kind of the point. After Bush Jr, being a republican wasn’t politically viable, so the GOP needed a way to re-brand themselves in order to convince people to vote for them. That’s what the tea party movement is.</p>

</aside>
<p>The way I saw it there were a bunch of different conservative groups at the beginning.  We had normal republicans, Austrian school fiscal conservatives, social liberals, libertarians, anarcho capitalists and the fox news war hawk social conservatives at these tea parties.  Then Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity started funding and advertising tea parties.  The fox news crowd co opted it around tax day 2009.  Everyone else went back to the obscurity they occupied before and the republican party and fox news continue to preach to the choir and try to rebrand themselves as super patriots.</p>

            <p>I agree, social security was never intended to be the sole source of income for retirees. Saving or investing is the smart thing to do, although I’m strongly considering pulling all my money out of my 401k before oil prices go up this summer and the fed-created free credit bubble collapses.</p>

            <p>Although I guess it doesn’t matter.  If someone is relying on social security for their retirement they most likely have bigger problems.  I have been planning my retirement since the day I turned 18 and I suggest everyone else does the same.<br>
Life expectancies for our generation could be well over 100, which will pose big problems for traditional programs like social security and pensions, not to mention retirement overall.  Start putting the money away now if you have not already.</p>

            <p>Social security is projected to be insolvent if it isn’t amended to deal with demographic changes, and there’s no reason it wouldn’t be.</p>

<p>By “fixed” you mean some people claim they aren’t accurate. The general argument of the article you linked to is that the ‘lowest tax rate’ statistic leaves out Social Security contributions and State taxes, and it doesn’t take into account the deficit (shocker). I already addressed the deficit fallacy, and people that pay Social Security get paid back when they retire so it isn’t really a tax. And state taxes are irrelevant when we’re talking about protests against the federal government.</p>

<p>And social security is projected to be insolvent by 2037 or sooner, so we will not be getting that money back.  But even if we get social security benefits, we will not be recieving what we pay in.  Do you ever read the statements the social security administration sends you?  They explicitly state that you will not recieve 100% of funds paid in.</p>
<p>This is actually the first year on which the amount of social security paid outweighs the amount of money collect from taxes.  This is a threshold that was not supposed to be reached until 2016 according to the CBO.</p>
