            <p>Gah…I’m late to the party.</p>
<p>I didn’t see a second hard drive in your parts list - be sure you get at LEAST a 1TB drive as an external backup.  When you load everything (OS, games, docs, music, etc) onto one HDD, and it crashes… yeah you’ll be screaming for a while.  That said, you also “overpaid” on your hard drive, so to speak - you purchased the RE3, which is a RAID quality drive.  Certainly, it should be a bit hardier than your average drive, but you may have been better suited to either A) get 2 of them and RAID or B ) get a 1TB Caviar Black FALS and save $50.</p>
<p>Regardless, definitely get yourself an external to backup to.  And even then, I’d recommend only powering on the external drive when you do backups (I do this, that way the hard drive only runs for ~4 hours per week for a weekly backup, instead of 24x7).</p>
<p>The Antec 900 is plenty roomy, although I would almost agree with the USB header statement - it depends on how good you are at routing cables and the placement of the USB header on your motherboard.</p>
<p>Also, DEFINITELY get an aftermarket CPU HSF (heatsink/fan) - I have <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103065&amp;nm_mc=OTC-Froogle&amp;cm_mmc=OTC-Froogle-_-CPU+Cooling-_-Cooler+Master-_-35103065" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this guy</a> and it keeps my Core i7-930 (overclocked from 2.8 to 4ghz) running at 42°C idle in a ~27°C room.</p>
<p>Otherwise you’ve got yourself parts for a very good system.  Post pics of the build!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Picture of my current system (in-progress picture, I built it a month ago).  That’s the Antec 900 and Hyper 212+ (vertical orientation really helps).</p>

            <p>Looks like not too bad of a comp  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I would have went with the blue/green team, but everyone has their preference  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I would think hard about getting a new case.  I used to love Antec cases, until I got a coolermaster.  I got a HAF 922 and 932 and they are freaking huge fits a 480 no problem.</p>
<p>For the HDD, ssd’s are still way overpriced for what they are worth.  I would just get 2 cheap 320’s or 500’s and put them in RAID 0 (unless youre anal about backing stuff up, then go with another type of array).</p>
<p>Finally the RAM, 2x4gb is prety good if you can afford it.  However you may want to do some research into the problems with the board when running more than 4gb.  I have a 790i and I cannot find a stable configuration to run 4X2gb.</p>
<p>All around a nice comp either way.</p>
<p>EDIT: Razer lycosa is a nice blue backlit keyboard for around 70 bucks, I have 2 of them and never had a problem with them.</p>

<p>Yeah I know someone who has put together 2 comps before so I’ll probably be fine. I’m going to get a 1 Terabyte Hard Drive, how large should the second one be that will have my OS? It’ll be Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.<br>
Another thing. I’m trying to decide on hard drives and like I said, how large should the one with my OS be? And should my main HD be internal or external?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Your OS should be installed on an internal HDD.  It would be pointless to install the OS on an external drive since it wouldn’t operate correctly, or most likely at all, on any other computer anyway.  Also, if this is going to be a gaming rig, your internal HDD should also be where you plan to install your games.  Otherwise, you risk losing performance due to the significant difference in BUS speeds between USB and SATA.</p>
<p>If you plan on Installing Windows 7 on it’s own drive, seperate from anything else, you will need at least a 20GB HDD for the 64 bit OS.  You could get by with that, but I would recommend you get at least a 30 GB, to ensure that you have ample “virtual memory” available to the OS.  Windows systems, regardless of the amount of RAM you have, will still hammer virtual memory.</p>
<p>Also, if you plan on using a brand new 1 TB drive as an external, be sure you get a quality enclosure for it.  With the abuse that most external HDD take, you should avoid 3.5" drives for that purpose.  2.5" HDD are built primarily for mobile applications, and can handle more abuse.  Get a 2.5" drive to stick in an external enclosure.</p>

            <p>Thanks a ton for all the help so far! I’m trying to decide between a 500GB or a 1Terabyte HD. I have a 500GB one now and I haven’t used all the space over um…4 years. And can someone run me through how to use a SSD? How large should it be, where do I put it?</p>
<p>I fixed my Memory into 2 4GB Corsair Dominators.</p>
<p>And does anyone know any KB’s with a blue backlight in a range of 50-70 dollars? Sorry that I can’t get the Logitech G19 =(</p>
<p>Am I going to need an additional cooler like a fan? And am I missing any important parts? I wear a headset 95% of the time on my comp so I don’t know if I want speakers, maybe later. Do I need a sound card or is the integrated chipset on the MB good? Will the integrated Radeon 4290 on the MB run Crossfire with the 5870 I want to get?</p>
<p>And I could use some help learning how to put it together when I get all the parts, maybe if anyone knows and good tutorial sites or W/E?</p>
<p>Sorry for being such a noob at this =( But I’d like this to work out very well and last about 5 years playing games just fine.</p>
<p>And does anyone know any CD/DVD Drives that can also Burn? I’d like just 1 drive.</p>

</aside>
<p>CPU, Mobo, PSU, and Case look fine. You’ll need a HDD as others have said (going SSD with a storage drive is a good way to go. Either that or a raid 5 configuration). The RAM you selected is for Intel builds. You can run it fine, but your processor (and mobo) does not support triple channel, only dual (basically you’d have 2 sticks in dual channel and a straggler stick). So if you are running a 64-bit OS which you should be, I’d recommend just getting two 4GB sticks (or four 2GB sticks, but the two 4GB is better in the long run).</p>

            <p>Do you have a hard drive selected? On such a high budget, you might put a portion of it into getting an SSD (in addition to a normal drive)<br>
You can install Windows on the SSD to get 15-second boot times, then put any larger programs like games on the second, spinning hard drive.</p>

            <p>Back in the s939 and early AM2 days black editions came with no heat sink.<br>
Not sure when that changed.</p>

            <p>yeah, black editions come with heatsinks, but the fan is really loud and it doesn’t cool the CPU perfectly down, mine peaked at 64°C.<br>
you should buy a custom heatsink, like the Scythe Mugen 2.</p>

            <p>Antec nine-hundred is a fine case, my antec 300 houses everything nice and snug but still with plenty of room, and has great airflow, although your choice is not one id go for especially, buy some Zip ties and put on your creative head, your gonna need it.</p>

            <p>You’ve got a triple channel memory kit there ( three matching sticks ), and a mobo that is only dual channel ( only takes pairs ).<br>
I would go with either one or two 4GB kits.<br>
EDIT: As another note, I’m pretty sure those black edition CPUs don’t come with a CPU cooler. You will have to grab one.<br>
Edit2: NM I guess they are including heat sinks in newer black edition CPUs…huh.</p>

            <p>The power supply should work fine. Make sure the case will take an ATX sized board, and it should be ok. Everything else looks good. Speakers built in to monitors are usually crappy, you might want a better speaker system. There is very limited space for speakers in most monitors, and smaller speakers can’t reproduce low frequencies as well. They tend to sound “tinny”, and can’t usually be turned very loud. I notice that you don’t have a dvd rw/blue-ray drive (blur-ray isn’t necessary yet), hard drive, keyboard or mouse listed. Without them you might get some pretty lights, but it would be fairly useless for much else…   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>The Motherboard is made to support the AMD Phenom II’s and Athlon II’s, it works with my CPU. What type of cooling would i need for the power output my my CPU has?</p>
<p>Btw um…I can’t see how many channels my power supply is and that my processor and/or motherboard need.</p>

<p>Ok, really good to hear. I love the blue on it lol. Btw did I forget anything? My moniter has built in speakers so do I need a sound card? I use a headset mainly.</p>

<p>also hope they fixed some wiring issues, the top usb port and such wires were way tooooo shooort to reach any motherboard i could think of, unless you mount it upside down and wire everything through the water tube holes to it XD</p>

</aside>
<p>Hmmm maybe the nine hundred two is larger, I really hope so because it is a beautiful looking case lol. The black looks ballin’ with the blue lights. Did I miss any components needed?</p>
