future

 :frowning: ,society gets dumber and dumber,so the number of musicians only drops
if the number of musicians keeps dropping the only logical answer is:no musicians in the near future,the human brain will be to simple to understand such complicated arrangement of sounds

            <p>On the other hand, you can’t say that anything underground will be good. I once listened to small live show where a guy banged the lowest notes on a keyboard and screamed something about his girlfriend masturbating. My point being, underground or mainstream, music can be good or bad. Plus, musical tastes differ, so in a lot of instances it’s better to say that artists are good or bad at what they are trying to do, instead of just spouting some catch-all like “they suck” or “they rock”.</p>
<p>What I will say about indie/underground music is that most bands are in it for fun and for the love of the music, instead of being under pressure from a company to churn out more songs to make more money, so that is a plus for them. But again, be prepared to deal with young pretentious hipsters who think they are better than everyone because of the music they like.</p>
<p>There is much more musical diversity now than there has ever been, and an unprecedented amount of artists are now trying their hand at it. As saivert mentioned, there’s still plenty of great stuff out there, but there’s a lot of crap you wade through to find it.</p>

            <p>yes. I don’t agree with the bashing of current music. Sure there are a lot of junk these days but there is also a shitload of more music.</p>
<p>If you want good music you will find it. Even today. And quit listening to radio and stop downloading from iTunes. You don’t find the niche underground stuff there.</p>

            <p>My theory in the matter is, music isn’t much worse, we just don’t hear of the good stuff as much. In the 1900’s we could regonise a good song, and it would become very popular. Now the masses pay more attention to bad music and the good stuff takes a back seat.</p>

            <p>Music wont die out, each year the number of bands in the world tenfolds, the problem is with the music industry, nobody cares about the quality or the real reason music was made.</p>
<p>It’s all about the 99c MP3’s on iTunes, the garage band recording a song with the cheapest equipment to turn the biggest profit, record companies signing up the most mediocre and ‘sheep’ like bands that sound like the norm to guarantee sales.</p>
<p>Singers who are giving pre-written songs and composers of the music to these cash grabs who don’t even get on the credits for an album.</p>
<p>Recording studios going out of business because bands don’t bother with quality because their songs are going to be listened to in MP3 format anyway because they have no care for a 44100KHz Studio Quality CD release.</p>
<p>The current industry sickens me, the loudness wars have nearly killed the Redbook CD format and it doesn’t help the MP3 in anyway.</p>
<p>Anyone who says they can’t tell the difference between an MP3 audio file and a WAV or original CD quality version is a retard and should be shot.</p>
<p>Music isn’t about profit and shouldn’t be, with the exception of Classical to a degree, music was an expression, with 90% of all modern music, again with the exception of classical, derived from blues, originally by the lower class, slaved at the time, african americans, and nearly all forms, country, rock, jazz, even electronc, came from blues as an expression and a desire to be different.</p>
<p>There are still some people in the industry, making music or producing it, that still have the passion, not all the cheap bands on myspace, I’m talking about people who have no problem with Creative Commons licensed music, engineers who will produce at a budget cost just because they enjoy it.</p>
<p>For anyone who enjoys music for the music, I recommend you visit jamendo, its a site for people to upload music they have either done at home or professionally, for you to download free of charge and with the option of donation, for the last year or 2 I have only gotten new music from this site, with the exception of some bands like NIN, where Trent Reznor owns his own label so I have no problems with buying his music retail.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">Real</span> R&amp;B (i.e. rhythm and blues, which is still blues with rhythm in stead of that Beyoncé-type bullshit) is good. But that’s pretty old by now.</p>
<p>And “electro” is not a genre. It only describes the way a piece of music was made. There are literally  hundreds of different genres that could be described as “electro,” many of which have good music.</p>

            <p>Well in a way yes.</p>
<p>That picture doesn’t compare apples with apples, but apples with oranges. So in the end it still compares fruit, but not a specific kind of fruit with a similar piece of fruit.</p>
<p>Point is: 99.99999997631% of the current mainstream music sucks unusually large elephant nutts, compared to mainstream music of 30-40 years ago.</p>
