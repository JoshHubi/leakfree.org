<p>Errr…no. In 2010, Google just put a big Google sticker on what was basically a Stanford/Volkswagen project until that moment, and started blabbing about Google this and that.</p>

            <p>I actually don’t like the idea of a self driving car…I actually like driving…where’s the fun in driving if the car does it by itself?</p>
<p>It would ruin the fast and furious movies…not that I’m complaining about that</p>

            <p>I think a lot of the accidents that happen nowadays would be eradicated if they just had a little more training required. Also police should put less emphasis on speeding tickets and up costs for being stupid and causing accidents. The ones ACTUALLY getting into accidents and acting retarded should get court costs and fines, not people who know how to drive well enough to feel comfortable at faster speeds.</p>

<p>Edit: Also would that not mean everyone would have to buy a Volvo to have that? And volvo would have to put random lorries driving around everywhere? And the fact that most people won’t use it as angry driver (like me) get sick of being stuck behind lorries of any sort so have a natural instinct to overtake them?</p>
