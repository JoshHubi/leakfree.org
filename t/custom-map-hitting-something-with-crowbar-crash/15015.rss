    <title>Custom map: hitting something with crowbar = crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/custom-map-hitting-something-with-crowbar-crash/15015</link>
    <description>I made this little test map that I wanted to work on. But when I load the map and hit something with the crowbar, the game crashes.
I don&#39;t know where the problem is. I verified the cache several times, even deleted all files except bigger vpks and re-downloaded everything, but it didn&#39;t help.</description>

            <p>I have the same issue with my maps.<br>
So far the workaround is to load the first map of Black Mesa, let it load for a couple seconds and then change to your map.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Black Mesa Inbound map</li>
<li>map </li>
</ol>
<p>The reason it crashes is because a particle is spawned and its not loaded thus the game crashes.<br>
No idea why they don’t load for custom maps.</p>
