    <description>Some of the weapons have been functioning improperly, and I figured I&#39;d just list off a few issues I noticed-

1. The tube on the Tau tends to freak out, similar to the ties and other jiggleboned props, such as the plants.
2. Due to the recoil mechanics, or for whatever reason, when you swing the crowbar for too long, the screen will shift to the right while the crowbar continues to hit in the same spot, and takes a very long time to recenter.
3. I experienced a similar problem on the MP5 where I would be firing it, and the view and crosshairs would continue to kick upwards while the bullets would land in the same spot
4. The Gluon&#39;s particle effects would cause such a heavy decrease in frame rate that my game would almost crash. Not sure why, it worked fine on the previous version.</description>

            <p>While playing now I also realized that during the idle animation for the Spas, when you examine the right side of the gun, there appears to be a shell clipping into the outside of the weapon</p>
