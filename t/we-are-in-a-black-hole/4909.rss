    <title>We are in a Black Hole</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/we-are-in-a-black-hole/4909</link>
    <description>Our universe was created by a star in another universe collapsing and forming a black hole. That&#39;s what caused the &quot;big bang.&quot; Black holes in our universe create/contain other universes. Sadly, travel between universes is impossible because it takes an infinite amount of time to approach the event horizon of a black hole. But still, it puts things in a different perspective, doesn&#39;t it?

            <p>I think it’s high energy electromagnetic radiation that can escape. If it has enough energy it can spontaneously turn into a quark and an anti-quark (I think those are the particles). One gets sucked in and the other is sent shooting out into space.</p>
<p>If that’s not cool enough, if a binary system gets too close to a black hole, the same thing happens with fucking <span class="bbcode-i">suns</span>.</p>
<p>Also, light changes speed in different mediums meaning that depending on the location, it’s not too hard to get to FTL speeds. Hence Cherenkov radiation.</p>

            <p>I guess I did misunderstand - if I’m getting you correctly, it’s an interesting idea. A alternative interpretation would be that the dimensions themselves are properties of universes, and are created as a result of the white-hole “big-bangs” that create the universes. In other words, they aren’t fundamental properties of the multiverse, but are created along with every other universal property as matter inverts itself inside a black hole. I’m leaning in this direction although I haven’t given it too much thought.</p>
<p>I think any scientific progress as far as dimension theory goes will be something interesting to look out for in the near future.</p>

            <p>I think you misunderstood me. I didn’t mean that a particular universe occupies a particular level of dimensionality.<br>
I meant that in a four-dimensional continuum (space-time) there is only one (any) universe, whereas if you look at the bigger picture (five dimensions or more) there is any number of universes.<br>
In other words, if you look at four dimensions (like humans do), you’ll only see one universe. If you look at five or more dimensions, you’ll see that one particular universe <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> other universes.<br>
This means that any universe occupies all the dimensions, but the higher dimensions <span class="bbcode-i">also</span> contain other universes.</p>
<p>In this theory, black holes could be considered a five-dimensional “direction”. However, since humans are tied to four dimensions (only one four-dimensional direction, time, at that), it is impossible to go in that direction, since it would take an infinite amount of time.</p>

<p>That’s pretty much what I was trying to say, if I understand you correctly. Using an analogy, two different universes would be like two different lines (4D lines) in a plane (5D plane). As for our universe occupying all the dimensions; that is indeed the case, but the higher dimensions (starting from the fifth) <span class="bbcode-i">also</span> contain other universes.<br>
At a 4D level, there is our universe (or any universe for that matter). At a 5D level, there are <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> universes with the same starting conditions. Something like that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> we’re on the same page, the way I understand dimension theory, it’s not that a particular universe occupies a particular “level” of dimensionality - they are encompassed by <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> dimensions. Objects in our universe have the property of length, width, height, 4, 5, 6, 7, and so on, the fact that we can only perceive the first 3 isn’t relevant to the fundamental nature of reality. Maybe 8,9,and 10 are the equivalent of length, width, height in the multiverse, but that doesn’t mean objects in a particular universe don’t also have those properties.</p>
<p>They never mention dimensions in the article because at the current state of our scientific knowledge, relativistic physics is totally incompatible with whatever kind of physics you’d call multi-dimension theory. There’s a ton of research being done to combine the two, but as of right now we can’t do it.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s pretty much what I was trying to say, if I understand you correctly.<br>
Using an analogy, two different universes would be like two different lines (4D lines) in a plane (5D plane).<br>
As for our universe occupying all the dimensions; that is indeed the case, but the higher dimensions (starting from the fifth) <span class="bbcode-i">also</span> contain other universes.<br>
At a 4D level, there is our universe (or any universe for that matter). At a 5D level, there are <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> universes with the same starting conditions. Something like that.<br>
I know I have linked it before, and I’m not sure if you’ve watched it yet, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkxieS-6WuA&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=fvwp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> does a great job of explaining how to imagine the dimensions. This model is being supported by scientists, so I think it’s reliable.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think the russian doll analogy is to be taken quite as literally as that. One of the articles (the NG one I think) refers to the black holes as having wormholes in them, which is then a “portal” into another universe (probably within our “instance” of the fifth dimension).</p>

I don’t know why, but it intuitively makes sense that infinite expansion within a finite space would account for the fact that, since our universe is expanding at a constant rate without slowing down, in a few million (billion?) years, the space between individual atoms in a human body  is going to be literally hundreds of miles apart in today’s terms, but the subjective experience of that human would probably be identical to ours (assuming any humans are left at that point).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As far as I understand it, when we’re talking about different universes, expansion is irrelevant, since at that point we have to consider the universes at a 4D level, i.e. from the “beginning” to the “end”.<br>
Time is subjective to human perception (“time does not exist”) and therefore so is expansion.</p>

<p>I’m accepting it as <span class="bbcode-b">valid</span> (note: not the same as “fact”) because there is evidence it is fact (the math behind it) and no evidence which suggests it isn’t valid. At the time it’s invalidated either mathematically or evidentially, I’ll have no problem whatsoever accepting whatever theory replaces it as the best guess at the time. The discussion of when a scientific theory becomes a fact (even after evidence is found supporting it, there’s always a chance that an exception will be discovered that disproves it) is I’m sure a contentious one even among scientists, so I’m open to other perspectives on it. The only thing I’m taking issue with is people denying there is any evidence to support the theory when its been mathematically proven.</p>

<p>So far, I haven’t seen anyone take issue with the theory being flawed or false in any way. The only thing I’ve seen anyone take issue with is you taking that theory (no matter how perfect and mathematically supported it may seem) as a fact. In response, the only thing I’ve really seen from you is reacting as if we’re trying to argue the theory as being false, when in reality it is neither true or false yet, merely a strong contender for possibility.</p>
<p>All you’re really accomplishing by embedding yourself in this theory is closing yourself off to being able to accept other possible theories that may come up later. I’m of the opinion that it is a decent theory, but still just a theory, and I’m perfectly happy to wait for someone to come up with a method to test it BEFORE putting it into a true/false category.</p>

            <p>Matt, I am not trying to argue that this isn’t a plausible theory that is to be taken seriously, I’m just saying it isn’t to be considered as scientific fact on the same level as relativity or gravity.</p>
<p>Anyway…</p>
<p>Correct me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t it basically come down to this:<br>
In a black hole, gravity is so strong that space-time as we perceive it is “compressed” (for lack of a better word) so that we obtain “access” (in theory, of course) to other instances of space-time. These instances of space-time (universes, in other words) are in effect instances of the fourth dimension in the same way that our universe at one point in time or another are different instances of the third dimension.</p>
<p>Anything wrong with that assessment?</p>

<p>In Einstein’s general relativity (GR), the insides of black holes are “singularities” - regions where the density of matter reaches infinity. Whether the singularity is an actual point of infinite density or just a mathematical inadequacy of GR is unclear, as the equations of GR break down inside black holes. Either way, the modified version of Einstein’s equations used by Poplawski does away with the singularity altogether.</p>

<p>Einstein’s theory suggests singularities take up no space, are infinitely dense, and are infinitely hot—a concept supported by numerous lines of indirect evidence but still so outlandish that many scientists find it hard to accept.</p>
<p>If Poplawski is correct, they may no longer have to.</p>
