    <description>Pic says it all:

[img]https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2457/3608058541_0b54ca0af3_o.jpg[/img]

all of the files are in Half-Life 2 Deathmatch\hl2mp\materials\models\props
files are: 
ribs.tga
ribs.vtf
ribs.vmt
ribs.smd
idle.smd
ribs_phys.smd
ribs.qc

I had a normal map and a spec map that was going to go in the alpha channel, but I got rid of them to try and isolate the problem....

here&#39;s the vmt and qc files (the formatting&#39;s screwed up, obviously, but still)
vmt:
[code]
&quot;VertexLitGeneric&quot;
{
	$basetexture	&quot;models\props&quot;
	$surfaceprop	&quot;bloodyflesh&quot;
	$model		1
}
[/code]

qc:
[code]
$modelname	&quot;props\ribs.mdl&quot;
$body mybody	&quot;ribs.smd&quot;
$staticprop
$surfaceprop	&quot;bloodyflesh&quot;
$cdmaterials	&quot;models\props&quot;
$scale		1

$sequence idle	&quot;idle.smd&quot; loop fps 1

$collisionmodel	 &quot;ribs-phy.smd&quot; { 
	$automass
	$concave
}

$keyvalues
{
   &quot;prop_data&quot;
   {
       &quot;base&quot;  &quot;Flesh.Small&quot;
   }
}

[/code]

Any blatantly obvious issues?

Also, the gibs move only slightly when shot, although they do fly nicely when they get RPG&#39;d, and I can&#39;t move them with the grav gun. Unfortunately automass didn&#39;t pull through and put the gibs at like 50 kilos (100ish lbs for us americans) so I&#39;ll mess with the weight of them tomorrow, although I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll fix the grav gun problem. The phys mesh is just a box, is that a problem?

EDIT GOD DAMMIT:
going over it, I realized that I erased the texture name in the vmt and forgot to put it back when I was messing with paths, so that&#39;s most likely the problem... oh well. If anything else is wrong, let me know... :retard:</description>
