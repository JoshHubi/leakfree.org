    <title>Suggestion : L4D2-style shove with weapon</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestion-l4d2-style-shove-with-weapon/11078</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve played a fair bit of L4D2 and one of the actions which can be performed by a player is to physically strike or shove with the currently held weapon.

So a shotgun, for example, is held with both hands, one hand at each end, and used as a stave to shove anything near away from the player.

This I think an excellent mechanic - it seems extraordinarily natural in emergency to hit or strike with whatever you have in your hand, rather than having to switch to the crowbar (which is too slow for instinct - it can only be conscious).  I found myself instinctively trying to push headcrabs away when they jumped close.

I think also, very importantly, this brings the player more into the game - more into the game-world, by being able to more instinctively interact with the game world and the creatures within it.</description>

            <p>The reason we’re given the shove in L4D and L4D2 is because enemies swarm you often enough to warrant a defensive move. in Black Mesa or any of the half life games for that matter do not need this weapon shove because enemies don’t swarm fast enough to do it.also worst part of it you’re thinking of is only one section in the beginning of the game when going down the elevator with the headcrabs dropping from above. you should have the crowbar out anyways for that. Not only that but weapons in L4D series do not have a secondary firing button, thus freeing up right click for them. the player would not have this in black mesa so they still flail about trying to press the correct key anyways.</p>
<p>Therefore, horrible unneeded idea.</p>
