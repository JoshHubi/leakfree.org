Seems like it will be the future of gaming. In my head, it sounds like the visual equivalent of the difference between tinny 2.1 speakers and bassy high quality headphones - in other words you need to try it yourself but it&#39;s already sounding revolutionary in terms of immersion. Can&#39;t wait to play something like Half-Life 2 or Mirror&#39;s Edge, both of which are currently supported.</description>

<p>In that case it’s not the training that’s patented, but the recipe.</p>
<p>If he learned how to make VR while at Zenimax under Zenimax’s funding, it’s their obligation to patent that method of VR. They have no rights to the knowledge he developed while there unless they specifically patent it. If ya snooze ya lose.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The PS4 is hardly making 1080p 60 fps, and isn’t making it in a lot of other games. Not to mention, the Oculus guys have been claiming that VR requires even higher frames than 60 to look just right. That means that “next-gen” games (quotes because next-gen is a shitty misleading buzzword) on the PS4 will probably run at 720p to make the necessary frames. Especially when you consider the fact that games are progressing and the PS4 is not, and we don’t have last generations benefit of quirky hardware that was only properly harnessed later in the cycle, so as time progresses the constraints on performance will only get worse. Gaming is going through a graphics revolution in the way of resolution.</p>
<p>Not to mention, if you’re gaming at 900p you’re REALLY missing out, as someone who owns a 1440p 27 inch. If you’re on a budget I’m sure it works fine, but higher resolutions look A LOT better for typical monitor viewing distances. On top of all that, upscaling from 1080p to 1440p (or, more likely, from 720p to 1440p or 1080p) is going to look like blurrry asshole, especially when it’s a massive immersive 3D VR blurry asshole pressed against your face.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Project Morpheus is going to have to make some pretty serious compromises somewhere because the PS4 hardware is frankly just too shitty. 400 dollar consoles just can’t compete with more expensive gaming PCs anymore.</p>

<p>Do you really believe they’ll add a processor to the headset?</p>
<p>I don’t doubt they can do +1080p60fps for their VR games but it will be at the cost graphical fidelity. You won’t be seeing games that look like Infamous Second Son or The Order 1886 running on VR mode.</p>

            <p>That chart looks alot different than most other viewing distance/screen size charts that I’ve seen, as most of them are trying to convey that you don’t need 4K TV at most conventional viewing distances (but that’s another argument for another day  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) Anyway, extrapolating the graph out so you get a estimate of beyond 8K for 2 inches distance doesn’t give much conclusive evidence towards what is necessary for VR, hell I can barely make out pixel level detail on a 7 inch 1080p tablet already at 2 inches (then again my eyes loose focus around that point, could be just me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> ). Well, I still haven’t actually tried a Rift yet, so its still guesswork for me :retard:</p>

<p>PS4 runs very few games at 1080p 60 fps. And regardless this isn’t high enough for VR according to the Oculus guys. They’re looking to more like 1440p 95 fps or something like that, which the PS4 would have a very hard time with unless the games were scaled down a lot to make them work at that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Of course it will 1080p games at 60fps, even equivalent PCs (and less) can do that. I’m not sure why people are underrating its capabilities, not to mention the extra VRAM will help at that. They could run 1080p games at a 1440p screen at the same framerate, the screen resolution doesn’t affect the performance unless they try to take full advantage of it.</p>
<p>The bottleneck (for the PS4) seems to be the CPU, they’ll probably find a way around that, like maybe the headset itself can contribute to the calculations, or better optimizations.</p>
<p>Sony know what they’re doing. And hopefully it should be a success, we need the competition + expanding the market</p>

            <p>I think the pixel density of the display matters more than the resolution of the game itself in this case. Hell,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=t0xaMIyUGfk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">if a bit of diffusion solved the screen door effect completely</a>, who knows what more surprisingly simple fixes will happen.</p>

<p>PS4 runs very few games at 1080p 60 fps. And regardless this isn’t high enough for VR according to the Oculus guys. They’re looking to more like 1440p 95 fps or something like that, which the PS4 would have a very hard time with unless the games were scaled down a lot to make them work at that.</p>

<p>This^<br>
I tried out the DKII, which is running 1080p, and it’s REALLY REALLY pixelly. I wouldn’t be surprised if 1440p still isn’t high enough.</p>
<p>Take this chart as a reference:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
Since the chart isn’t intended to work with such close viewing distances, and I’m guessing the Oculus’s lens in each eye complicates things, take it as a pretty rough estimate. But imagine we ignore the lens (which I think makes the effective viewing distance even smaller) lets say the Oculus’s viewing distance is 2 inches and, IIRC, the screen size is 7 inches. Since the relationship is supposedly linear, lets multiply both by 10. You get 70 inches by 20 inches. According to our chart at that resolution you want more than 8K.</p>
<p>That’s obviously a super rough estimate, but I think it makes it pretty clear that 1080p won’t cut it.</p>
<p>I bet the Morpheus on PS4 will just upscale from 720p. But I wouldn’t be surprised if even at 720p the PS4 still won’t pull the target 95fps. Especially as time progresses and the hardware becomes outdated.</p>

            <p>~60fps</p>
<p>3D rendering consists of rendering the game twice at a slightly different angle for each eye. Doing that for full 1080p on PS4 won’t happen without some significant graphical downgrade. And it wouldn’t be 60fps either.</p>
