    <title>Continuity mod?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/continuity-mod/12237</link>
    <description>I am not really sure this is the right place to bring this up, or if this has been discussed before, but here goes:

I am wondering if there is a mod in the works that ensures some kind of continuity between Black Mesa and Half-Life 2 and its episodes. Like implementing Black Mesa&#39;s Test Chamber in Half-Life 2&#39;s intro, or replacing Valve&#39;s more 1-1 recreation of the Anomalous Materials lobby with Black Mesa&#39;s more detailed version in Episode 2.

Of course, I don&#39;t imagine that it is a thing that the dev team would work on. If anything I think something of this scope falls more into something the community would be likely to do.</description>

</aside>
<p>My thoughts exactly. I’ll probably look into what I can do to make this and my own ideas towards continuity possible, though I have no experience in Source modding.</p>
<p>On that note, I think it would probably also be worthwhile to wait for Filip Victor’s HL2 update v3 to be released. If it lives up to expectations, it should fix most bugs and errors that have been introduced over the years, which would make things easier and more worthwhile, I think.</p>

<p>EDIT: Well, not entirely. The actual challege is deciphering BM’s AMS room, because the area is extremely dynamic. It’s a matter of figuring out what’s absolutely needed for the AMS to look like it’s running (read: after stage two emitters are fired) and delete all nonessential entities.</p>
<p>And with that being said, it might be best to wait on a mod like this since BM hasn’t been fully released. And the AMS map is definitely going to see changes because, after all, the Xen parts aren’t implemented right now.</p>

            <p>You would need to decompile the Anomalous Materials maps, the map with G-man’s Heart-to-heart from Ep2, and (copy, then) rename sdk_d1_trainstation_01 from the HL2 example maps, copy over the relevant brushwork and content, etc, but it would be fairly simple.<br>
The hard part would be fixing up the decompiled maps and optimizing them so they don’t completely break the delicate resource balance that all three games have.</p>
