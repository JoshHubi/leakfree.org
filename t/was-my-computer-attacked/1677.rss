    <title>Was my computer attacked?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/was-my-computer-attacked/1677</link>
    <description>I was just playing L4D when somebody named [FﮎR] ☠Dαzεr ︻デ═一 began babbling through his mic. I told him to shut up and that no one cares. He then said fuck you and I muted him. The game was running fine. Then all of a sudden I got extreme lag and my computer froze. I as I was killing the computer I noticed that in the chat it said something like &quot;a voice channel has been created between you and [FﮎR] ☠Dαzεr ︻デ═一&quot;. While rebooting my computer it automatically ran chkdsk and said that windows fixed some problems with Main Files something or other. I then got an alert saying windows had terminated microsoft generic hosting for my protection. My computer is running fine right now.

So my questions is, was the crash just a coincidence, or did 
[FﮎR] ☠Dαzεr ︻デ═一 somehow attack me and make my computer crash?

Sorry if I&#39;m just being a paranoid idiot and this was just a regular old glitch.</description>

<p>Thanks, I was just worried because my computer has crashed plenty of times before, but never in that way. Well, that’s good, but I was hoping to get some sick pleasure out of having the idiot VAC banned. :[</p>

            <p>“A voice channel has been created between you and <span class="bbcode-i">so and so</span>” That means you’ve been playing on a modded server is all. Any chance he boomed/pulled/pounced on you at the time that message popped up? It allows you to talk to whoever you’ve victimized with your attack as an infected. I use this to say “Om nom nom” whenever I pounced a survivor.</p>

<p>Eric Fong, you are by far my favorite community member.</p>
<p>OT: Um, it’s not paranoia, you’re justified in your fears. I think it’s unlikely that it was an attack, but to be sure you might want to run a <a href="https://housecall.trendmicro.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">virus scan</a>.<br>

<p>i really don’t think that gamers could use double-action attacks (steam exploit + win. privilege escalation exploit), so it’s barbiturates time for everyone .)</p>
