    <title>HL1 soundtrack maps?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl1-soundtrack-maps/13705</link>
    <description>A while back, LieutenantSkully [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/15961-Half-Life-Soundtrack-But-this-one-is-different-slightly/&#39;]managed to modify the maps to play the HL1 soundtrack in the places where they played in the original game,[/url] but the two download links in that topic have long since died.

EDIT: Faceless HECU Marine #102 is a godsend: [url=&#39;https://www.mediafire.com/download/q4dn6550bs7aqxk/Black_Mesa_-_Modified_Soundtrack_1.1.rar&#39;]&#39;https://www.mediafire.com/download/q4dn6550bs7aqxk/Black_Mesa_-_Modified_Soundtrack_1.1.rar&#39;[/url]

Does anyone still have these maps on their machine, and if so would you be willing to share them on file sharing sites like mega or similar? Don&#39;t get me wrong, Joel Nielsen did a wonderful job with the soundtrack but now I wanna play the game with the classic music, only problem is the maps don&#39;t have quite a few of the original music cues so some tracks won&#39;t play in areas they used to (e.g. Apprehensive Short playing upon witnessing the seizure zombie in the chair in [i]Unforeseen Consequences[/i]).

Thanks in advance!</description>

            <p>OP, I’d recommend editing the OP to have the backup link.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Yeah Crypt I actually read what you said in another thread, but with pretty much no experience with the source SDK and any related tools that was already not an option for me, at least right now it isn’t, I was hoping someone still had the files on their hard drive or something and was willing to upload it to mediafire or some other file hosting site. Thanks for giving pointers for others coming across this though.</p>

            <p>thanks for the response Crypt, sounds like a ridiculous amount of trouble. At least i know what is needed, still hoping someone still has these files and could just PM me a link if that allowed, thanks again for the information.</p>

<p>In order to get them to play in the same places, you’d have to decompile the maps, open them in Hammer, fix the decompilation-induced errors (to ensure the maps actually work when you’re done (also not a guarantee)), then edit the maps manually to cue the tracks to play where you need/want them. It’d be a lot of effort, esp. if you don’t have any level design experience.</p>

            <p>nobody? i bought HL when it came out on cd rom i bought it again when steam came out (yes there was a time before steam) and bought it again for another account plus blue shift and opposing forces. I have the music legally i just want to use it in this awesome re-envisioning of HL. So could someone help me? or at least point me in the direction to what i need to do to get the music i already own in this game with the proper timing etc?  You help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
