    <title>What If It HAD Been An Icepick Instead Of A Crowbar?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-if-it-had-been-an-icepick-instead-of-a-crowbar/3741</link>
    <description>i recently got my hand on the old Half-Life 2 Alpha, its really glitchy to say the least, but i noticed the old icepick instead on the crowbar.....

What im thinking is what would this have done to the Half-Life series if it had been an icepick?? 

Why an icepick, why not a hammer, or a knife like in OF?</description>

            <p>I think they putted a Icepick instead of a Crowbar to make it blend with the surrounding terrain…Like…What is a Icepick used for?Climbing ice things and all that…and what weather is forecasted at the Borealis?Chilly.<br>
Crowbar is for more urban places like city 17 where you would do nothing with a Icepick.</p>
