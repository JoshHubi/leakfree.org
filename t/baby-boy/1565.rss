    <description>Rodney (my son) became a father...

Brecken Michael Waldren
Born: Fri 10/2/2009
At: 2:22 AM
In at: 6 lbs 4 oz

Couple of other interesting facts though: My son Rodney and Atlanta (baby&#39;s mommy) do NOT get along. At all.  As in they cannot even have a 5 minute phone conversation without the two of them pushing each other&#39;s buttons and fighting. So they are no longer a couple and haven&#39;t been for months. IN short, she wants my son to just go away and leave her and the baby alone.  Rodney doesnt have any finances to demand his rights, so he is pretty upset and broken up about being shut out they way she is doing.  On top of it, it is an even bigger slap that she didn&#39;t give the baby his father&#39;s last name.

Or is it just me?  What are your thoughts on illegitimate baby&#39;s names and whether it is ok to not give them the father&#39;s last name?

<p>She didn’t take his name <span class="bbcode-i">herself </span>back when they WERE married, why should she give the baby his name after their divorce.</p>
<p>Pshaw… a flippin mess is what it is.  Hopefully she will let us in as a part of his life tho.</p>

</aside>
<p>Since she had a fight with your son and completely hates him, shes going to completely deny him of the baby. This is so she can have a leverage over your son (since she must see him as her enemy).</p>
<p>My advice is to tell your son to suck in his pride and bit his tongue. Call up the mother say that your sons sorry for being an asshole and you guys want to meet up. At the meeting: tell your son to lie, and say he was wrong and was at fault, and what he has to do to make it up to her.</p>
<p>Now your going to have to play by her rules since she has the son. Since the baby is hers, she can have the baby have her last name.</p>

            <p>It’s not that simple. The only part a man plays in “making a baby” is pretty fun (hopefully for the woman, as well), while getting pregnant and carrying the baby inside, having to eat for two, being flooded with hormones that make you go crazy most of the time and getting more and more horrifically encumbered by the growing human being in your belly is usually seen as “hard work”.</p>
<p>The mother, therefore, has had to endure more pain and suffering to bring the newborn to this world than the man (though committed husbands that have been sent out for a pack of strawberries and a couple of raw livers at 3am on a late december night might think otherwise).</p>

            <p>My last name, after I was born, was my mother’s maiden name, Carnson. My parents weren’t married at the time, but once they were it changed to what it has been for the past 19 years (they were married when I was 3): Entwistle.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen it as odd for a child to be given the name of it’s mother if they aren’t married.</p>
<p>However, congratulations on the latest addition to your family, even if it is under tumultuous conditions =/</p>
