    <title>Where to buy a mid-range PC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/where-to-buy-a-mid-range-pc/4406</link>
    <description>Seems like the right place to ask....

My dad&#39;s decorating and wants to replace the beige heap of shit that he&#39;s had as a computer for the last several years. He only uses it for bits and pieces on the internet, so performance isn&#39;t really an issue. He&#39;s looking for something that looks fairly attractive, being a newly decorated room and all

Our last PC was built for us, and has been a succession of pains in the arse, so we&#39;re looking to buy one retail. Which leads me neatly onto my question: Seeing as I only use a laptop, does anyone have any idea where would be a good place to buy such a PC? I have a sneaking suspicion that PC World isn&#39;t the best choice, but I could be wrong

At the moment looking for a dual-core with integrated graphics, probably a couple GB RAM. We really don&#39;t have that much money, so no point going over the top....

Anyway, thanks in advance

EDIT: In the UK  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

            <p>Lian Li is known for their high quality computer cases.</p>
<p>To greatly improve speeds for normal tasks such as loading a program or booting up the computer I strongly suggest to buy a solid state disk instead of a hard drive. They can be up to ten times faster than a regular HDD but they do come with a heavy price ticket and they have a  low capacity (you could easily install a normal HDD for mass storage though).<br>
Using an SSD however will improve performance more than any other component if you’re using the computer for internetting etc.</p>
<p>As for the CPU, the new Intel i3/i5/i7 series overclock extremely well and deliver massive bandwidth in combination with triple channel memory thanks to the integrated memory controller inside the chip (instead of the motherboard northbridge). High speed memory is not a must have, the performance increases are not very impressive. Make sure to disable any power saving features such as SpeedStep and C1E in the BIOS that will automatically underclock and undervolt the CPU to save power.</p>
<p>Computers are always power hungry, if cables are an issue just spend a good hour on cable management inside and outside your computer (cable straps are your friend).</p>

            <p>They’re aluminum (so mid-range gray) with a black screen-frame. It fits well in any setting, tbh.</p>

            <p>Unless the whole decoration is in tones of black. Then the $900 iMac will stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>Unless they also make those in black.</p>

            <p>If you want something that just looks good without ruining the view with cables and 50000 peripherals and with enough performance to use the internet: a £900 iMac.</p>
<p>Anything else will effectively destroy a newly decorated corner.</p>

            <p>If all you’re looking at is for the internet, e-mail, etc. you’d probably do fine with just buying a stock Dell or HP computer.</p>

            <p>Seems like the right place to ask…</p>
<p>My dad’s decorating and wants to replace the beige heap of shit that he’s had as a computer for the last several years. He only uses it for bits and pieces on the internet, so performance isn’t really an issue. He’s looking for something that looks fairly attractive, being a newly decorated room and all</p>
<p>Our last PC was built for us, and has been a succession of pains in the arse, so we’re looking to buy one retail. Which leads me neatly onto my question: Seeing as I only use a laptop, does anyone have any idea where would be a good place to buy such a PC? I have a sneaking suspicion that PC World isn’t the best choice, but I could be wrong</p>
<p>At the moment looking for a dual-core with integrated graphics, probably a couple GB RAM. We really don’t have that much money, so no point going over the top…</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks in advance</p>
