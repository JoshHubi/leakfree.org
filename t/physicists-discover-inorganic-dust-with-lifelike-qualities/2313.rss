What do you think? Does it seem like we&#39;re getting a bit too excited over the interesting reactions of plasma particles, or could we be on the verge of understanding how life came to be so many eons ago?

I would definitely like to think the latter, but until I learn more about this I&#39;ll have to remain on the fence about it.

<p>Hmmm…<br>
I’ve never understood why scientists think that the conditions have to be the same as earth fore life to exist, as though life evolves in the same way every time, and can’t adapt or change.</p>

</aside>
<p>I seriously doubt that scientists think the only forms of life in the Universe must be carbon based. I think it’s just a lot easier to search for carbon based life forms because we know a lot about carbon based life.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True, true. But perhaps the observed “evolution” of plasma structures into more and more stable forms could occur very rapidly - maybe when plasma is created at the point of a lightning strike, given the right chain of evolved structures, during one in a million lightning strikes, the plasma could evolve to a stable state where it would persist for several minutes. Even leaving aside UFOs for a second, “ball lightning?” I don’t think it is that far-fetched.</p>
<p>Given the observed semi-intelligent activity of plasma particles on a micro level, I’d expect the behavior of a plasma macro-structure to also exhibit weird behavior.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, I’m not interested in debating semantics over what you consider a “UFO” to be. Please refer to the image I posted earlier, that is specifically the class of objects I’m referring to. There is no existing word in English for “triangular glowing orb formations which the British government considers to be made of plasma” so I’m going to continue to refer to them as “UFOs.”</p>

            <p>Ah, that does sound very interesting. Even the proposal that this could be a possibility gives me a science erection.</p>
<p>If these interactions became apparent to us, and the plasma was able to, over-time, form itself into a macroscopic life form, uniting all pieces of its primordial parts/structures growing to into a full-fledged macroscopic form, it would definitely change our view on what life is. Just as the discovery of viruses did.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if its possible for these types of structures to survive inside earth’s atmosphere for very long. Plasma has a hard time getting enough energy to be around for more than a couple seconds here.</p>

<p>My mistake - i guess the ‘dust’ part is irrelevant then, and we’re just talking about “complex, self-organized plasma structures,” to quote ScienceDaily.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s not just “living/dying,” the article also talks about them being attracted to each other, reproducing and passing on ‘genetic’ information so only the strongest structures survive. And this is just in a laboratory simulation! I can easily imagine large-scale structures such as the triangular one in the image eventually being produced by this process in a natural environment. For example, plasma orbs appearing to fly in “formation” because of these self-organizing interactions. As the ScienceDaily article proves, we still don’t fully understand the behavior of Plasma, so perhaps future simulations will show this…</p>

            <p>I’ll bite, Matt.<br>
The British military may call UFOs plasma phenomenons, but that doesn’t mean they’re correct or even telling the truth. Hell, the US military calls UFOs weather balloons and swamp gas. The space dust doesn’t react when exposed to plasma, as the space dust IS the plasma.</p>
<p>The nature of this magic living space dust seems to be that you have to observe the reactions of the particles before it becomes apparent. I wouldn’t think that the helical structures living/dying would cause it to zip about the sky, etc.</p>
<p>I’ve never heard of any type of plasma acting like that. mostly is just acts like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKrh66YgP9A" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p>I started what, now? I’m not the one bringing up an argument from a 3-month old thread in unrelated topics, and I have no interest in continuing it.</p>
<p>If anyone cares to respond to what I posted, I consider it far more interesting than arguing semantics with ThreeGoatPig.</p>
<p>edit (here’s my question, again):<br>
The British government considers <span class="bbcode-b">this </span>to be caused by plasma, somehow:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>If space dust behaves “interestingly” when exposed to plasma, perhaps the two phenomenon are related? Maybe UFOs like the one in the image are plasma crystalized around atmospheric dust particles, kind of like snowflakes?</p>

            <p>Is there anyone else here that didn’t understand my first comment? It’s times like this I get the feeling mattemuse is trolling me. However, I will try to explain it in the off chance that he is serious.</p>
<p>UFO stands for Unidentified Flying Object. This covers many different incidents up in the sky, from misidentified airplanes and satellites, to gaseous anomalies and plasma, and even including possible interstellar spacecraft of alien origin.</p>
<p>You keep posting statements that read as if plasma is the <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> form of UFO. I keep reminding you that is not the case, and that there are many different types of UFO.</p>
<p>Your conversational comprehension is apparently nonexistent though, so you will continue having no idea what I am saying.</p>
<p>Also, this discussion wasn’t about UFOs, and isn’t the right place to be arguing them when the topic is about protolife in inorganic materials. If you want to argue about them further, I suggest you bump your UFO topic where this would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>And insulting me and my intelligence won’t get you any points with anyone with half a brain (and, reported by the way).</p>

<p>Yeah, here of all places, for example the place where you’re heckling me autistically with no apparent relevance to the topic at hand because you’re still butthurt over your wrong opinion being called out in some long-dead thread? You’d never want to get into ‘it’ again <span class="bbcode-b">here</span>, would you? Of course not.</p>
