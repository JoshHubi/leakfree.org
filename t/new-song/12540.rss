    <title>New Song</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-song/12540</link>
    <description>So my Band, Dystopic Dawn, finally tried to upload a video. It isn´t perfect, far from it, but here it it is:

[url]https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=xx4RrbPqrIs&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dxx4RrbPqrIs%26feature%3Dyoutu.be[/url]

Any suggestions would be nice. Comments as well. This is only a demo, so just keep that in mind. When we eventually get a decent recording set-up and such, we hope to improve the quailty and produce a more diverse (instrumentally and vocally) song.

I would have put this in ShowOff, but it isn´t complete as of now. So instead, I put it here for your help and suggestions. We plan to release other songs, covers and originals. Thanks for your time.</description>
