    <title>Crash during last part of lambda core</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-during-last-part-of-lambda-core/13916</link>
    <description>So far I&#39;ve crashed about 3-4 times,one time my GPU completely shut off and I was forced to restart my PC.
A minute or so after the first enemy spawns while that scientist works on the portal,the game experiences a graphical hiccup and either freezes,crashes or causes directx or gpu driver to no longer function but the audio still plays from within the game and interaction is still possible,albeit useless since nothing can be seen.
Occasionally the last frame that renders shows visible lack of some graphical effects or shadings and etc.
No crash dump file is created by this crash.

i3 4150 Haswell CPU
GTX 260 GPU
H81M-D MOBO
4 GB DDR3 1600 MHz

This issue appears to be similar to the issue I had with TF2 in 2013 and 2014 where the game kept crashing the driver for my gpu.</description>
