    <title>Shadows - only medium</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shadows-only-medium/10018</link>
    <description>Why are there only &quot;low&quot; and &quot;medium&quot; options for shadows? Is that because the game might run with Intel HD 3000? I&#39;m using notebook with Intel HD 3000/GeForce GT540M and I&#39;m not sure which one is used. I&#39;m starting Steam by right click and start with Nvidia but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s enough? Game runs perfectly in 1600x900, everything maxed out - it wouldn&#39;t run so good with Intel, would it? ^^ So what about the shadows?</description>

            <p>What’s the DirectX level you’ve got reported in the advanced gfx settings dialog box? And, yes, it’s next-to-impossible to get decent FPS with Intel HD 3000 in Source-based games at higher resolutions so most probably your system really uses nVIDIA chip to render things. Then again, lacking “High” for “Shadows Details” might be an optimus-related problem with the game failed to detect the correct dxlevel to use at the first startup.</p>
