    <title>Finish Half-Life 2+eps before Black Mesa?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/finish-half-life-2-eps-before-black-mesa/9453</link>
    <description>:retard:

So I tried to finish Half-Life 2 and its Episodes before Black Mesa came out, but there was a surprise announcement of the game. Now I am stuck with the question of if I should beat Half-Life 2(+eps) or just play Black Mesa. The thing is that I dislike Half-Life 2 overall and don&#39;t want to replay it again. 

So I am faced with the question: Do I just not play Half-Life 2 (because Black Mesa is going to ruin it by being a better game) or do I postpone Black Mesa? I&#39;ve only been waiting three years for it. 

I know this is silly, but because of my schedule and certain circumstances I only really have any opportunity to play on the weekends. I&#39;ve just been juggling this question through weekdays and I still can&#39;t decide. 

It&#39;s pretty much refusing to play a better game because you want to get the plot of a worse game which might make the experience with the better game better... The trouble comes from that I&#39;m being too wishy-washy. So instead of just deciding on the spot I&#39;m going to present it here so that I don&#39;t make a another small decision I end up regretting.</description>

            <p>I have my doubts that you´ll like Black Mesa much if you didn´t like Half Life 2. They should be pretty similar.</p>
