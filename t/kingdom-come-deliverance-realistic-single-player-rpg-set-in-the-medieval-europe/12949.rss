A first-person, open world, realistic RPG that will take you to Medieval Europe in a time of great upheaval and strife. A humble, young blacksmith loses everything to war. As he tries to fulfill the dying wish of his father, Fate drags him into the thick of a conspiracy to save a kidnapped king and stop a bloody conflict. You will wander the world, fighting as a knight, lurking in the shadows as a rogue, or using the bard’s charm to persuade people to your cause. You will dive deep into a sweeping, epic, nonlinear story from Daniel Vávra, an award-winning designer from the Mafia series. Our unique, first-person combat system lets you wield sword or bow in both one-on-one skirmishes and large-scale battles. All of this - and more - brought to life beautifully with next-gen visuals delivered via Cryengine.

            <p>It would’ve been better if they didn’t take the hollywood approach. Now it’s basically just another fantasy RPG that happens to have a historic setting.<br>
Still, looks interesting. The combat looks like it could be fun.</p>

            <p>You should know, however, that the man in charge, Dan Vavra, while having a history of working on some cool games in the past (Mafia, Arma…), also has a history of needless insult-throwing, generally difficult personality and other problems that have resulted in multiple fallings-apart with former producers and teams.</p>
<p>I wonder how he plans to place dozens of realistic villages (actually, 2 would already be too much) into a 3x3 km space – historically, a village needed about 15 sq. kilometers to feed its own folk, and here we are supposed to have 2 castles and several villages in half of that space.</p>
<p>Having horse-riding on a 3x3 km space is also funny – you will be able to ride from one edge of the map to the opposite one under 10 minutes (and you should be able to RUN from edge to edge under 30 minutes) – and they expect to place huge armies into such tiny space? I come from a region where Napoleon defeated the Austrian and Russian armies in the 19th century: the battlefield is 10 x 15 kilometers - surrounded by 5 villages and 1 town - and the battle, using cannons, horse-riders and foot soldiers (with rifles), lasted about 16 hours. This makes me doubt their claims of realism or epicness. It may work in a movie like Braveheart, but a computer game?</p>

            <p>The graphics are beautiful. But the combat as-is looks a little dry.</p>
<p>In either case I’m seriously considering funding this.</p>
