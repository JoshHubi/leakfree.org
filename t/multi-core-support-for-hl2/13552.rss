    <title>Multi core support for HL2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multi-core-support-for-hl2/13552</link>
    <description>I recently started playing HL2 again after a long time gone and found it was using all the cores of my cpu.  I then tried HL2 EP1, HL2 EP2, and Portal.  They all have been upgraded to multicore support!  Woot!!

Does anyone know when this happened?  I can&#39;t find anything but a few references to it in 2006-2008.</description>

            <p>I’m glad they added multicore support for Half-Life 2 as well now people with more than one core can put their hardware to use.</p>

            <p>Yes, there was multicore support added years ago and it didn’t work well, and was disabled.  I think it could be enabled in the console, but never tried it.</p>
<p>Now it is enabled and works!  I see a max of 300 fps and the worst I saw was 170 fps.  The only downside to it I know of is a lot of tearing.  Enabling vsync should fix that.</p>

            <p>I think the option has been in the games for quite a while (I don’t know the exact point it was put in) but I’ve always heard it’s kind of buggy in most Source games. Not sure how true that is.</p>
