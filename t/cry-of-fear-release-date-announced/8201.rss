Well, what can we say? The response to the FB &quot;like&quot; campaign we posted just over 6 weeks ago has been absolutely astonishing to say the least. The amount of cooperation and support shown by the community has been absolutely mindblowing, so from myself and the rest of the Cry of Fear team we&#39;d like to say thank you. Not only have we kept our promise to reveal the release date after we reached the 5000 likes, but we&#39;d also like to tell you that we&#39;ve made, and finished, an entire extra campaign to thank you guys. You can actually see a tiny, tiny snippet of it hidden in the trailer we released just recently.

So, thank you all! Special thanks go to Pewdiepie and Spike and Barley for rallying their fans to our cause. Check out their Youtube channels and support them!

            <p>I think it just might be the textures themselves. I noticed some of them are quite good, and some aren’t so good - to the point where some of the bump mapping seems pointless on such a low-res texture.</p>

<p>You’re assuming the protagonist is right handed. I suppose since he uses the gun in his right hand without dual wielding you’d think that though… Maybe he’s ambidextrous  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  .</p>
<p>Edit: My game doesn’t seem to look as good as the screenshots on the Moddb page. Seems like the textures are too low resolution, though maybe that has to do with the resolution I’m running at? Anyone else feel this way?</p>

            <p>That bothered me too. Also, hitting reload when you are dual wielding with a gun and the phone and it just won’t let you reload unless you put the phone away… just do that automatically. A phone is not very big.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I understand that it makes it like film and some people like it, but I just always found it annoying personally. Though I suppose for a sp game I can deal with some, but I had to lower it as a lot of the game is dark so at the default level it was a bit to prominent for my taste.</p>

            <p>I turn down the film grain a bit in games like Left 4 Dead when I need to save on processing power and recognize threats more readily. But in a single player game like Cry of Fear it has a very cinema-like effect on the visuals and lends the game some style. After all, have you ever tried shooting any kind of video footage in low key light? It’s grainy as fuck. But yeah, good thinking on the devs to have options to allow people to turn that off if they so please.</p>

            <p>Oh fucking jesus. These monsters are truely horrifying. [Spoilers]<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]When I saw the floating grudge thing in the basement, I shit 90,000 bricks. Also, the part after you put in the code to unlock the door, and you hear a chainsaw starting up, and about 50 different hallways = HOLYFUCKINGSHITRUNRUNWTFBBQ!<br>
[Spoilers]</p>
<p>Definitely a very well done mod. I’m very impressed, especially for this being on the gold source engine. Although being scary, I’m sure I will thoroughly enjoy the campaign, and maybe eventually the coop. Not having played many mods this year, and probably won’t play very many others, I think this is easily my MOTY.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>The reason I didn’t watch a video is because I don’t really want spoilers. I just wanted to know if it’s worth trying to play it again or not, given that if the next save point was to be in 1 hour then it’s likely to crash a gazillion times before that ever happens.</p>

            <p>Guys, the game runs, but it freezes when I do certain things (mostly when opening the inventory) at which point I have to quit it. It’s been like the 4th time I’ve watched the intro and played up until the part where I get the suggestion of using the phone as a light source. However, I don’t really want to endlessly play the same part over and over without actually knowing when the next save point will be. Can someone give me a clue as to how far the first save point is?</p>
