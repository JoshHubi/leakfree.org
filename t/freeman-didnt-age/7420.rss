    <title>Freeman didn&#39;t age</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/freeman-didnt-age/7420</link>
    <description>OK, at the end of HL1 Gman puts Gordon:freeman:into stasis or whatever, and keeps him in it until the events of HL2, now, the hl2 world is set 20 years ahead, and freeman hasn&#39;t aged or changed, but his friends have, Eli says that he (Gordon) hasn&#39;t changed a bit.  but what is really weird is that they didn&#39;t freak out or anything, i mean it&#39;s 20 years later, and he&#39;s still 27 kinda. you&#39;d think they would have at least battered an eyelash at this fact. 

it&#39;s also safe to presume that Gordon most likely met Eli&#39;s wife and Alyx back at black mesa at some point, cause they&#39;re friends.
thats crazy lol, Gordon met Alyx, a pooping crying baby, then 1 month later, Booom, aliens, then Boom 20 years later and he meets her again, as 1 fine piece of a...:jizz:...  anyway i thought i&#39;d just point this fact out.  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>I get the feeling that Gordon is employed by his friends and maybe even by both sides on different deals. Just remember how Breen mentioned to Gordon that his contract is “open to the highest bidder.” And also, I just have to mention how you can see Odessa talking to Gman just before you make it to his outpost. It seems like he was striking a deal, maybe to help defend against the gunship. I think alot more people know about his contract and Gman than we think.</p>

<p>I also find it wierd that Eli would hint at such a thing. Maybe he’s just ‘that kind’ of dad. I know if I had a daughter I’d never hint at anything like that and, more than likely, would try to get her to avoid it at all costs.</p>
<p>But really, Alyx’s attraction to Gordon is strange too. I mean, he never ONCE showed a hint of personality and she’s head over heels for him. Even if you take into account Freeman’s personality in Freeman’s Mind I still don’t understand why Alyx would like him, seeing how he’s kind of an asshole. But I digress.</p>

<p>why would you avoid sex at all costs when no children could be concieved for a long time but now they finally can while this guy risked his life to save your life and is currently saving THE WORLD!</p>

<p>In all reality, Gordon and the GMan are working together.  Gordon gave the GMan $50 bucks to put him in stasis for a few years, simply so Gordon wouldn’t have to wait forever to be able to get down with Alyx.  The deal was for 18 years, just to make it legal, but the GMan bought some really good weed with Gordon’s $50 and forgot to bring him out of stasis until 20 years had passed.  Needless to say, Gordon got $10 back.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>A recap for those not paying attention:</p>
<p>Kleiner (while Gordon is in custody by Barney Calhoun): “Gordon?! I expected more warning!”<br>
(implication: Kleiner knew that Gordon was going to be returned to Earth, just didn’t know it was going to be on the “Red Letter Day”)<br>
Eli (while sitting on the coach waiting for Alyx and tea, in Episode 2): “You know of whom I speak. Our mutual friend.”<br>
(implication: The Black Mesa incident was NOT the only occasion when Eli met Gman).</p>
<p>So, the likely sequence of events is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gordon is put into stasis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine invade Earth, Earth surrenders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eli / Kleiner contact G-man (or are contacted by him) and strike deal that Gordon Freeman will be returned and help overthrow Combine. Payment is unclear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gordon is returned approx. 20 years after BM incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the course of HL2 + Episodes 1 and 2, Gordon manages to cripple Combine’s rule over Earth, also severing the link with their overworld (probably).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, before that happens, G-man sends a warning message to Eli (“Prepare for unforseen consequences”). It’s not yet clear which unforseen consequences he was talking about, whether Eli’s death or something futural, but anyway, Eli is killed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>I think he got younger. I mean, look at the picture of him at the menu of HL1, and then look at him at the cover of Half-Life 2. I see a clear age diffrence.</p>

            <p>Nobody was truly surprised about Gordon showing up or what he looked like because they Purchased his contract from the g-man. Eli wants Gordon to fuck Alyx because due to the combine there hasn’t been a child born in 20 years and humanity is dying off. Plus, gordon is a bad ass and eli wants his progeny to have a chance in the horrible world earth has become</p>

<p>I barely understand what you just said, but presumably a slow-teleport was involved, like the one where Alyx &amp; Gordon teleported from Nova Prospekt to Kleiners lab a week later, but no time passed for them. No “giant ice cube” necessary.</p>
