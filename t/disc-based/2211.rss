    <description>I am just curious as to whether or not Black Mesa will be able to run off of a disc at some point (You download it and burn to a disc yourself, not buying it in a shop on a disc). I don&#39;t think it would due to issues with steam, but I think it would be quite cool.</description>

            <p>Disk space is hardly the reason, I would have thought that having a permanent disk of it is reason enough, Hard Drives are prone to failure more than any other part of a computer, and plus, you wont have to download it again.</p>

            <p>In order to efficiently load the game from optical media the team would have to restructure the game content. Similar to how things are stored on Console game discs. With optimizations made specially for the DVD format.</p>
<p>Just dumping the “for harddrive” content over on a disc wouldn’t work well.</p>

<p>[align=left]I’m sure, at least once EP3 is released, valve is going to want to port it like they did with “still alive”…</p>
<p>It would make an interesting post-release community project. Just underclock a TriCore AMD thing down to 2.0ghz (~3.2Ghz without OOE/limited BP), get a 2900 GT (virtually identical to the Xenos) and downclock the RAM, get a gig of DDR2 in dual channel and try to keep the total memory footprint (vid+sys) under a half gig. No devkit required![/align]<br>
