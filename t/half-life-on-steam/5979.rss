    <title>Half Life on Steam</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-on-steam/5979</link>
    <description>I put my code in for HL, and it came up on my list (I had it on disk, but something was wrong with the uninstaller, so I decided to get HL off of steam.) It finished downloading and now HL is running like crap. But it only does that for the steam version. The disk version runs fine. Any ideas as to why it is doing this? I really enjoy the game, and it is basically unplayable, even at the lowest settings.</description>

            <p>Try changing the render mode. (IIRC you can chose between OpenGL, Direct3D and Software, mess with that setting)</p>

            <p>You’ve got it on disc and it works fine. Why even bother with the Steam version? Nobody cares that you’re playing it and they’ll totally forget the “0_22one is now playing Half-Life” that will pop up in the lower right of their screen.</p>
