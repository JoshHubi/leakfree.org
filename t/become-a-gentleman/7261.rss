    <description>It is the time my good friends, to behave with properiety, and to speak with good tongue. 

I do hope the other gentlefellows among us will follow in suit.</description>

<p>Sir, I have lived for many years and never before in my life I have ever read such a fine rebuttal against such accusations.</p>
<p>Bravo, sir! You managed to change my mind. I no longer believe you fine gentlemen have strong feelings of affection and lust for other gentlemen alike, nor do I believe that you are of low class and even lower manners.</p>
<p>I apologize for making such claims and hope we can live in a permanent state of harmony and trust.</p>

<p>Kudos! We are barely worth of raising our hats to you and your exceptional use of the English language (as well as to your creativy in regard to acts of painfulness, good sir). I hereby declare my deliberation to exalt you into the office of a gentleman in exemplo. Everyone in favour speak his Aye!</p>

            <p>Im in intense agreement with Sir Medevilae, us true gentlemen are few in number. It is in our best interest and self preservation to elevate the masses around us so that they too can bask in the refined glory of gentlemanship! If we are to descend into a level of depravity by taunting them, and denouncing them as non-gentleman then we resign ourselves to a violent flogging and public humiliation!</p>

<p>Dear Sir Random, I beg your pardon for using a soubriquet such as this.</p>
<p>“Manners maketh man”.</p>
<p>Words uttered by William of Wykeham, the founder of Oxford, a true gentleman in a time of beastly attire. Being the motto of Oxford, a veritable stithy of many fine gentlemen, you should reconsider your estimation and judgments.[size=-1]</p>
<p>It is by politeness, etiquette and charity that society is saved from falling into a heap of savagery. And not by birth or class.</p>
<p>Have a fine day, my orgulous friend.<br>
