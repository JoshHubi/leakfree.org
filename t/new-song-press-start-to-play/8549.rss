            <p>It has some nice stuff going on, I especially liked at 1:50 where the noise cuts out to the piano, and again at 3:33 where it does the same thing.</p>
<p>I like how with this song, there isn’t something loud drowning out most of the subtleties for most of the song, but I’m not really a fan of the electronic “noise” (I don’t know the terms, dunno what it’s called) you used for much of the song.  The stuff that kicks in at about 0:27, and then gets louder at around 1:00.  That’s just personal taste, though.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s pretty good, but not really my style.</p>
