            <p>Why does Shepard have to be in HL2-OP4? Barney already has a civil protection uniform. He already has access to the opposing side. His cover is deep enough that he gives orders to other cp. And he is not relegated to the laidlaw vault or an easter egg in a different game set in the same universe. I know shep has his fans but now that he has been molested by the g-man, he is on the same side as gordon. Barney on the other hand has not been in the molester jar, has not met the g-man, has a history between the games and actually works the opposing force of the rebels. Plus, there are loads of potential hl2 tie-ins. Like finding gordon, working under cover as cp, Protecting kliener, eventually leading a rebellion and getting citizens out of city 17, meeting gordon along the way a few times and then trying to get to white forest. I think most of this stuff is suggested in the darkshift thread.</p>

<p>Well, since you asked in svenska, it was… rather off from the original with the introduction, since in none of the protagonists of any half-life game has talked whilst playing it so far… Although, I can’t wrap my head around what these pod things are…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>FIRST, A STASIS POD (frys kapsel) is well…the things in hl2 in nova prospekt and in the citidel that have sleeping people in (by using SUPER FAST freezing).</p>
<p>SECOND, I wanted Adrian to talk since…well…its enough whit ONE hlaf-life hero not saying shit. I always think Gordon thinks smart like i better be quiet so i dont make this worse. I dident like however that both Barney and Adrian dident talk since…Barney talks in HL2 (yeah i know all that “valve wants you to SUIT the characther…you be his voice” thing but common…its enough whit Gordon!) and Adrian is dam soilder. COMMON SWEAR! SCREAM. BE HUMAN. We got to understand what person Barney is thanks to HL2 but we dont know ANYTHING about Adrian. I wanted Adrian to have a soul, not that Gordon is soul-less…i see him as a guy who dont want to cause trubel open his mouth whit stupid questions. So i made Adrian talk. So that people could understand him more…</p>
<p>THIRD, You dident tell me EXACTLY what you though about…good or bad? Bra eller dåligt? Snälla säg…</p>
<p>Anyways il write part2 of chapter 1 if you guys like the first part and are intrested for more.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Okey…time for my idea…man this my first post on the forums but whatever…<br>
(Note that i had this idea for a year ago and that Shephard will be in NP in my story was NOT made up after i saw this thread. Shephard also talks here.)</p>
<p>Opposing Force 2 (or that i called it for a year ago, Half-life 2: Green backup)<br>
Chapter one, Past shadows (Part one, since i cant type the hole chapter right now).</p>
<p>Adrian wakes up whit a headache in the black room…hes not sure whats going on or where he is…he puts his hand on his head starting to have huge flashbacks…its like pictures of his past, on what hapend in Black Mesa… Sudenly everything comes at him…every picture…every sound… until he sees…him (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xg6M8gb5rE" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xg6M8gb5rE</a>) That man. The man whit the suit. The man who was back at the training. The man who gave the info to the HECU team. The man who prisoned Adrian in Black Mesa making him struggle for survival even more. The man who destroyed the entire place…and took Adrian away from everything. He opens his mouth and starts to talk: “So we meet again cor…poral. The things you did back at…Black Mesa wassss…outstanding…and now yet agai…” Shephard stops him from saying anything more, “No…you…GET AWAY! Its all you…dont…” He tries to crawl back from the man in fear, but it seems that he cant move anywhere… “What have you done? WHO ARE YOU?” The man watches at Adrian whit a look that shows that hes somehow disappointed… “Seems like…i gave you some kind offf…fear…and now when i needed you at…the most…” Shephard looks to the left and the right as he tries to find an exit. “But leting you stay here…are not an option but…i cant kill you…” Shephard looks into the mans eyes…green eyes…this man…is not a man… “I can only…hide…your fear…” Adrian finds the whole thing confusing. “What?”<br>
Then…the pictures of the past are back, but instand of going towards Shephard…they go away from him. Faster and faster until…a light comes.</p>
<p>After 3 seconds…the light is gone…but also the dark room. Shephard wakes up in some kind of pod. The glass on the pod is full of frost, the whole pod is cold…but inactive…<br>
Not understanding how he got there he tries to see trough the glass seeing shadows of people walking. His head starts to hurt, he have forgoten everything about the man in the dark room…as his memorys of him was “hidden”…<br>
The people outside starts to talk and their voices starts to get louder.<br>
“Im pretty sure this is the right way” “You sure? Cuse i dont wanna be blown up by some freaking human…combine…cyborgs…” “Dexters rigth, the dam alarm got on for some minutes ago…how we not know someone is just gonna pop up and kill us?” “Guys…i may be just a medic but common…the alarm cant be cuse of us…we just got here and we havent been seen by ANYTHING. I migh just be a medic bu-” “Why you stop talk Charles?” The shadows of the three men are coming closer. “There is someone in that pod…moving…” “What? Thats impossible! Thats dam stasy pod…it cant bee-” “JHON. First, its STASIS…i think… And second, this thing isent activated.” The shadow of one of the men comes closer to the window of Adrians pod. The man outside rubbs away the frost showing that he is a maybe 30-40 year old guy whit glasses and some old HECU gear<br>

<p>My idea was that it could go either way, with two different endings:</p>
<p>Ending A: Shepard chooses to remain faithful to Barney when told of the Resistance. He fights the good fight but is pulled out of City 17, by the G-Man, just before the Citadel goes pop.</p>
<p>Ending B: Shepard becomes disillusioned with humanity’s chance of survival and fiercely declines Barney’s offer to become part of the Resistance. He rises quickly through the Combine ranks reaching Elite (fighting and killing Resistance along the way, losing more of his humanity, both physical and mental). Just before he reaches the Citadel, G-Man pulls him out citing that Shepard was the only Elite Combine with a chance at stopping Freeman.</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
