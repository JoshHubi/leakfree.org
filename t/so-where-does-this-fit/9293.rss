    <title>So, where does this fit?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-where-does-this-fit/9293</link>
    <description>I&#39;m extremely excited about the possibility of indulging further into the Half Life story after ALL this time.

However, and I&#39;m sorry if this is a duplicate thread, but where does Black Mesa fit in?

Do the events in Black Mesa follow on from Half Life 1, completely over writing Half Life 2, episode 1 and episode 2? Or does it carry on at the end of episode 2? Or does it replace every Half Life ever made and completely retell the story?

I own all of the Half Life saga and I want to know which parts I should replay so I&#39;ve refreshed my mind ready for Black Mesa.

Final question, I noticed this is going to be free? Free on Steam? Free to those who already own Half Life?

Sorry if these are dumb questions, I just couldn&#39;t think of anywhere else to ask so bluntly.</description>

<p>So, they’re not continuing the story, they’re just making another Half Life: Source in theory? They’re not even including events of Half Life 2?</p>
