            <p>Yeah, the game is a bit less casual now, at least on normal difficulty… Grunts are fast and powerful, Vorts are <span class="bbcode-i">FAST</span>, but not that powerful, I actually got owned by three Houndeyes once, they are not as bouncy and cheerful as before, and with the effects enabled, they are actually a real enemy… Bullsquids can be tactical, and it’s not that easy to avoid being spit on. Turrets are also fast and accurate, you can’t just wait a Barnacle to pull you up, so you could kill it with a crowbar, it will bite, you can’t just run into zombie and kill it with few crowbar strikes, they won’t flinch, and will hit you at least twice before beaten if not careful. Plus many other things…</p>
<p>On the other hand, Guards are useful and actually less suicidal, and then again Headcrabs are a joke.</p>
<p>I love it! It’s brilliant and challenging.</p>
