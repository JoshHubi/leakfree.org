    <title>Could this Canadian bill hurt Steam?</title>

So it looks like if a software company wants to install any software on a Canadian computer, they&#39;ll have to provide a screen detailing what the software does and asking permission. Sounds like a nice way to stick it to spyware douchebags, but I think Valve might run into some trouble with this.

So Steam would have to ask permission every time it wants to run an update. That doesn&#39;t sound like that big of a deal, but if you have 150+ Steam games, that would be a lot of annoying popups. And I mean A LOT. 

It might sound like a small inconvenience, but it flies in the face of one of my favorite things about Steam, which is how automated it is. 

If this means a change in the frequency and size of updates, it probably won&#39;t just affect Canucks, either.</description>

<p>I’m sure a large portion of Valve’s revenue comes from Canada.<br>
Even so, I’m confused how this would hurt Steam? All they would have to do is take 5 minutes to type up a simple message and have it displayed for all users located in Canada.<br>
They already have to take special measures for many of the regions they offer the service to. This would be one of the simpler fixes I would think.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing though. Steam is almost constantly downloading updates – be it for the client itself, Valve games, third party games, tools, etc. The way this bill is worded, every single time one of those updates happens, a pop-up would be required detailing the changes in a specified format and asking the user to click OK before it can continue. It’s not just a matter of agreeing to a TOS every time you boot the program up.</p>

            <p>i think it would be sufficient to prohibit any unauthorized data-collection. that way updates that don’t change software to collect data wouldn’t have to be marked. if someone tries to sneak spyware into his software it surely would be discovered at some point and the producer would get his ass kicked. problem solved.</p>
<p>maybe the act will be changed a little bit to give somewhat of an option.</p>

            <p>Why can’t they just let people fuck up there own computers?  It confuses me why the Canadian government is trying to butt in like this… though I am an American of course.  Any Canadians want to add their opinions to this?</p>
