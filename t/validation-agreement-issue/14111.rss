    <title>&quot;Validation&quot; (&quot;Agreement&quot;) issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/validation-agreement-issue/14111</link>
    <description>Hello everyone. I bought Balck Mesa last week. However, since Monday, I can&#39;t start the game : a sort of updating called &quot;Validation&quot; (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is downloading. The problem is that this &quot;downloading&quot; starts again when it has just finished. When I try to start the game, an error message appears and says that my game datas are corrupted and I can&#39;t start the game. I don&#39;t know if is a sort of verification process but I bought my game, it&#39;s not a free copy (I can prove it) and I want to play with it. Please somebody help me. Thanks in advance.

            <p>I finally found a solution : if I reinstall the game, the “validation” doesn’t appears anymore. I don’t know if the validation has been done during the second installation of the game or not. Thanks for everyone and have a good game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  ! See you soon !</p>

            <p>Norton also approved our false positive report, and said they’d update their definitions on the next update, flagging our stuff as safe. That was nearly 2 weeks ago. Try updating your virus definitions and trying again, see if that works.</p>

            <p>The ‘leave your computer alone’ part referred to you disabling Norton, setting BM validating or re-downloading, but staying away from the internet while it did so to avoid doing anything that put you at risk of a virus or malware. Contrary to what Norton may tell you, disabling it for an hour while you’re not even at the keyboard will most likely not cause your computer to explode.</p>
<p>For that matter, neither will uninstalling Norton and replacing it with one of the many freely available better alternatives.</p>

            <p>Did you had the same problem ? If it’s the case, what have you done ? Because I tried to “leave my computer alone” and the “validation” hadn’t succeeded.</p>

            <p>I really wouldn’t worry about that.  If you’re that concerned, just leave your computer alone while it downloads Black Mesa.</p>

            <p>Yes, I’m using Norton Antivirus. However, Norton didn’t sent me any notification and “vlocalize.exe” didn’t appeared in my timeline, even if I’m searching it. In addition, I can’t reinstall BM with Norton disabled because my computer is vulnerable to spywares and virus, so it’s impossible to me to play anymore.</p>

            <p>You are probably using Norton Antivirus, which has flagged one of our executables as a virus (it is a false positive; I filed a report with Norton and they said this will be fixed in their next virus definitions update).</p>
<p>You will need to disable Norton for the update. A helpful user posted this solution here:</p>
<p>“Open norton and click the performance tab. Look on the timeline for where it was detected. Mouse over it and click on view details on view details. Then click on the instance in your security history listed as vlocalize.exe. Click on it then under recommended Action click “options” then click “restore &amp; Exclude” then tell it okay. After that verify your install then update. If you get stuck in a verification/validation loop then delete the local files and reinstall.”</p>
<p>You may also need to delete Steam’s “downloading” folder, as this is where it stores the vlocalize until Norton quarantines it, if the previous steps don’t work. Otherwise, you may unfortunately have to reinstall Black Mesa (with Norton disabled).</p>
