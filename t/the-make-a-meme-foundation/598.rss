Are you lost in the endless series of tubes that is The Internet? Have you felt inactive lately because everyone else recites nonsense while you sit around doing nothing but laugh when you recognize it?

Well now&#39;s your chance to create your own meme, and let it see the light of day!

            <p>I see, I do see… Though, is not some of the art of writing lost?</p>
<p>I admit, skimming through my words makes them indecipherable. But at times, multisyllabic words (when spoken) weave a beautiful web of language… if only readers were assured to appreciate these intricacies. I suppose that’s a lot to ask for a web-forum.</p>
<p>a funny relevant story:</p>
<p>The first sentence of my first assignment for my first college English course was, unbeknownst to me, written in iambic pentameter. (The professor had noted it… and I think that good first-impression helped my grade later on.)</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’s a good book. I used to be similarly verbose in my writing until, at my mother’s prompting, I read some carefully-chosen parts of Plain Words. Since then I’ve learned to scale it down, and not to use six words when one will do (or a six-syllable word when a one-syllable word will do).</p>
<p>It takes a lot more skill to write clearly and concisely than it does to use verbose language, and it’s especially important to do so on the 'net, since not everybody is a native English speaker. For that reason, it’s a good skill to have. For the record, Plain Words is considered a seminal work by many professional writers.</p>
<p>An example of what I’m talking about:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve tried that on numerous occasions, and oftentimes I’m actually able to express my ideas concisely… but that usually only surfaces when a subject matter is concrete. (Procedural programming, for instance.)</p>
<p>In less physical matters, in the realm of ideas (a sort of placid congeal), my sentences become gunked up in the quest to let a blurry image manifest in your head with an equal quality as I’d seen it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Could become:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve tried that many times before, and I am often actually able to express my ideas concisely, but only on more concrete subjects such as procedural programming.</p>
<p>When discussing more abstract concepts and ideas, I become verbose because I find it difficult to put my thoughts across accurately enough that you can understand what I mean.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The translated version contains the same meaning, but is a lot easier to read, especially for the above-mentioned non-native English speakers.</p>

<p>In less physical matters, in the realm of ideas (a sort of placid congeal), my sentences become gunked up in the quest to let a blurry image manifest in your head with an equal quality as I’d seen it.</p>
<p>Thus, to summarize in five words this particular image that’s relatively easy to grasp:</p>
<p>My analogy is image compression.</p>

<p>Is this from experience, or just sarcasm?</p>
<p>If the book helped you (and you reference it specifically for more than just its title), then I would begin to consider it. But I’m frankly not impressed by the excerpt.</p>

<p>So nobody here is afraid that ants are evolving to exploit human engineering?</p>
<p>Also, funny thing about all the people complaining about forced memes instead of memes in general. They must believe every meme must start in 4chan through a feedback loop of idiots talking, but that’s why other sources must combat idiocy through concentrated, dedicated foolishness.</p>
