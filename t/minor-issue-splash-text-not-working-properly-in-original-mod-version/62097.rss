    <title>[Minor issue] Splash text not working properly in original mod version</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/minor-issue-splash-text-not-working-properly-in-original-mod-version/62097</link>
    <description>Kind of self explanatory. Just things like chapter titles being displayed as &quot;#hl2_Chapter1_Title,&quot; and stuff like that. I was wondering if I could maybe go into the files of the game and find something that let me change what the splash text says, but I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t verify the game files, because, again, I&#39;m using the mod version. Any help is appreciated.</description>

            <p>This issue happens when the mod is not installed in a folder called <code>BMS</code> in the <code>sourcemods</code> folder. There is no need to edit game files. Just make sure you install the mod to <code>&lt;Steam library&gt;\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS</code>. The <code>sourcemods</code> folder should be located in the Steam library location where you installed the Source SDK Base 2007.</p>
