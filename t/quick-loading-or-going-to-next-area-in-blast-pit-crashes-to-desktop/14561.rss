    <description>Hi Team,

This is after climbing down the silo and going either path; Top or bottom path it doesn&#39;t matter.
When you quick load with F7 or try to move to the next area to turn on the oxygen/fuel the &quot;LOADING&quot; comes up for a moment then the game crashes to desktop.

My game is definitely not running slowly/stressed, if I turn v-sync off it&#39;ll run consistently at 170+ FPS.

I started a new game from the same chapter and it didn&#39;t help. I verified the game cache in Steam and it reacquired 5 files but this didn&#39;t help either.

I opted into the beta in Steam and it didn&#39;t help.

I have attached multiple dump files from the issue.

            <p>Hi RedEye,</p>
<p>I have restarted my computer and it hasn’t changed.<br>
I don’t have any mods added to it at all.</p>
<p>As stated in my original post;<br>
I had already verified the cache.<br>
I did restart the chapter from the new game menu.</p>
<p>Starting a new game from any other chapter works fine, being able to quick save and quick load. It only seems to affect the second map of this chapter.</p>
<p>Because I originally played the Mod version of Black Mesa, then purchased the Steam Store version I don’t have saves to move past this point to the next chapter.</p>

            <p>Have you researched what others have done to fix problems since the update.</p>
<p>The following fixes 80% of all game problems after the update.</p>
<ol>
<li>Restart the computer. (shutting down and turning it back on is not the same in W8/10)</li>
<li>Next, Verify the game cache. if you don’t know how, ask.</li>
<li>Disable any and all mods, somes mods are broken after the update.</li>
<li>Restart the chapter/level from the NEW game menu, not a saved game. A save could be corrupt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do all 4 and you will probably be back playing the game in less than half an hour.</p>
