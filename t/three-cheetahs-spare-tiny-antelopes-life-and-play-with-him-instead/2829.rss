            <p>Someone commented on that page as well that in the end it was eaten, and that there were pictures. But then someone else debunked the pictures.</p>
<p>So I am going back to believing it was a fairy tale ending.</p>
<p>Isaiah 11:6 The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them.</p>
<p>Wait wait wait… the leopard will lie down with a GOAT, not an IMPALA. OH CRAP! Run baby RUN RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN! It’s a lie!</p>

            <p>It was all made up I’m afraid, they did eat it in the end. A Norwegian newspaper checked with the photographer and he confirmed it had been eaten in the end. That’s nature.</p>
<p>Article in Norwegian:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Quote:<br>
The brutal reality<br>
It is now that you can live with a lie, you should stop reading. For though it really is amazing scenes that played out in the meeting between the three young Gepardene and the little impalaen, so has the Daily Mail dressed a little story. Especially the ending, where the flirtatious and exuberant calf turns back to his flock.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not true, "said Yann Metrich from the French picture agency Bios Photo.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are those who manage the images to the photographer, the couple Denis-Huot, and specializes in nature photography. And both the photographer and the agency administers Metrich reveals the ruthless truth:</p>
<p>The instincts won</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What does not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the Daily Mail is the last picture from, well, we do not. The small impalaen was eaten, determines Metrich.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But what about the happy end Daily Mail describes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the discovery of self. Impalaen was of course killed and eaten in the end, "said Metrich and shows the last four pictures from the meeting between Gepardene and the little calf.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And it is the mother nature as we know it. Free for Disney happy endings and predators that defy the instincts to show mercy.</p>
<p>It is deadly serious on the savanna in Masai Mara. And the little impalaen was simply not fast NOK. But in a few minutes there was a certain magic between hunter and game. It is the images we have chosen to display here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used Google translate, so it’s a bit weird.<br>
