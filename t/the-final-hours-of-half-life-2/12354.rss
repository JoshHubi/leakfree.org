    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/12354</link>
    <description>It&#39;s a really insightful [url=https://uk.gamespot.com/features/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2-6112889/]article[/url] about the game,all the trouble the guys that were making it went through and much more.In my opinion,it also puts a whole new perspective on the absence of any Half - Life 3 related news as well.
Now,bear in mind that it&#39;s a very long read(25 pages)but BELIEVE ME ...it&#39;s well worth your time.</description>

<p>This is called mainstream :U.<br>
And Valve actually had a fair decent amount of <span class="bbcode-b">DEVELOPERS</span> at the time.Most of the other stuff you see on credits mostly exist of people who were not even actually involved with the development.</p>

            <p>so what do they say ?<br>
i recently read that no team is working on hl3 .<br>
hl was made by g.newell and Mike Harrington , by now mike has gone elsewhere and gabe is a billionnaire…that does not help to create a second great game [to be not starving to death either ;’] .</p>
<p>avatar , is a great movie and we ll have 3 more movies soon , Cameron does so much things with computers for them ,that may be we gone have great new games based on avatar and the best engine of the market : unreal .<br>
at least if they have the idea to team , they should create something very big</p>

            <p>I read the captions, the excerpts, and parts of the actual 25 page thing. I think I get the idea though. Pretty interesting stuff there.</p>

            <p>Ah, this was back before Keighley became a major sellout. Good read. I always enjoy reading long articles like this because they usually never leave any details out.</p>

            <p>I read it over a year ago or so, it truly is insightful. In fact, I felt bad about Valve devs once I was done reading. Developing a game for such a long time takes a toll on both mental and physical health, it indeed may explain why there’s no HL3. If I were them, I wouldn’t want to touch such a long-term project anytime soon.</p>
