    <title>Will Black Mesa be Released Early to Reviewers?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/will-black-mesa-be-released-early-to-reviewers/8147</link>
    <description>Hi!

I&#39;ve been following the mod for a few months now and I know the procedure for it being released and everything but I just had one question.  Will the team be distributing early copies to websites such as IGN or other sites to do reviews for the mod if they ask?  I realize why they wouldn&#39;t though since there&#39;s a risk of it being leaked early.  But I&#39;m sure there are sites that would like to do a review of it.  Maybe not IGN since they don&#39;t do mods but who knows?  This mod&#39;s gotten a lot of publicity so they might just ask for one.  I know how careful the team is being and I respect any wishes they have on this topic.

Thank you!  And have a very safe, and productive day.</description>

<p>The final push developers do <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> gets rid of all bugs, and it’s very rare that games get patched to fix all bugs.  Sure, things get more stable as more patches come out, but bugs are still there.</p>

<p>Now why would I want to do that? Nearly all of the footage I have seen of it was buggy to the point of unplayability. I saw a player take cover from a dragon behind a pillar and the dragon just reached through it like it wasn’t there. Do that crap online and it would be: HAX! <em>kick</em></p>

            <p>I live in Russia, and therefore do not know English! I’m from the city of St. Petersburg! I am looking forward to this game I have been suffering because of this and can not sleep at night. why she is not ready yet, I do not know. so as you can guys. release at least a demo version is it so difficult. I was tired of waiting. Russian tired of waiting.the world tired of waiting! then release? make a beta version or demo! and let people play! and then as long as people do play the game further. the more the game is free. Then what’s the problem? I do not understand! treat the fans who love you is not true.!I am for that release date announced! or allow to play the game! so … this is not cry from the heart …!</p>

            <p>I have been waiting for so long that in the meantime I finished high school, and enrolled in the college of electrical engineering.<br>
Most people here have also been waiting for ages.</p>
<p>I’m glad it’s they will not be realeasing to reviewers first, why would some<br>
fatass critic get the game before this community… we have been waiting for so long.<br>
It’s only fair that everyone gets the mod at the same time.</p>

<p>honestly i laughed. well played on words.<br>
yet still a little mean.</p>
<p>the only problem. proving a legit source. i think the dev crew would be reluctant to hand it out to even the most well published.</p>
<p>its almost a crime against humanity to do so.<br>
i mean.<br>
poor little joey who’s waited all this time doesn’t get touch the snippet, but for example IGN does. then gives a review on the same scale that Paul WS Anderson directs his movies. it would crush countless souls.</p>
<p>i see the point. but the point is broken. to the point it cant serve the individuals.</p>
<p>well. thats how i see it.</p>

<p>I was only trying to show respect for the devs and no demand they give me a copy to review.  All of these people have put a lot of hard work to make a great game.  Not to mention, all of the nasty comments they’ve had from people who can’t be patient for the game to come out.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>You bitches keep asking or making slight insinuations toward the possibility of them letting you test the mod. That’s cute… BUT IT’S WROOOOOOONG!!!</p>
<p>You can’t give them a choice! You have to demand! Make them feel that they will greatly regret the moment they say no!</p>
<p>So does anyone heere have the BALLS to stand up to the devs?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My last post might not have gone through so I’m replying again.  I apologize in advance if I posted this twice.</p>
<p>If you’d be open to be doing so, I’d love to review it!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">   I have a blog that’s 99% of the time about tech stuff which includes video games.  I’ve even talked about Half-Life and other Valve games on there as well.  The readers I do have would probably enjoy it.  If you can actually let me play it and do a review on it, that would be great!  But if you can’t, I totally understand and respect your decision.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I never really understood the term review …<br>
Is it even possible to re-view a game that hasn´t been released yet ?<br>
Shouldn´t it be called preview in that case ?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A PREview would mean you’re watching, or playing in this case beforehand.  But a REview would mean going back and REview what you have learned/experienced and talking about it after the fact.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I think volunteering is a bad idea. If you get to play BM before the rest of the community, I’m pretty sure you’re going to get eaten, raped and killed by an angry mob. Just saying… :jizz:</p>
