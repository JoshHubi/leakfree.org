    <title>A few things i would like to see in BMS</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-few-things-i-would-like-to-see-in-bms/8944</link>
    <description>1.i would like to see more scientist models and more character designs to make the environment feel more realistic.
2.some crowbar texture changing things. ex:when you hit an alien with it green blood is on it when you hit a human red blood (a little darker than the crowbars default color) on it and for the blood to casually wash off while in water.
3.for sounds such as foot steps  to be an option to turn off.This one doesn&#39;t bother me but a few of my friends complained about it.
4.some hidden weapons/rooms that don&#39;t require cheats and a reference to chumtoad.

I hope you took some of my suggestion&#39;s into mind and thank you for reading.</description>

            <p>Yeah, and Iyiyiy, I don’t think you are aware that it is only Black Mesa now as opposed to Black Mesa: Source. You can just call it BM instead of BMS.</p>

            <p>There are still some suggestions they probably can take at this point, these wouldn’t be it.</p>

            <p>You know, giving suggestions this far on in development is kind of futile don’t you think?</p>

            <p>The scientist model/ blood on the weapons is already in. The footsteps can be turned off by replacing the footstep sounds with silent .wav files with the same names. Number 4 will probably don’t happen never.</p>
