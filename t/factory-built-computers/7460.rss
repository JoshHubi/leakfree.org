    <description>I know you hardcore computer geeks will call me a moron, but I&#39;m looking for a powerful factory built gaming computer since I really don&#39;t have the time or knowledge to choose anything outside of a gfx card to build one myself.

What&#39;s the best system I can purchase for less than $2,000?</description>

            <p>I googled something on my phone, it was a 500w power plus review and they said that the model number doesn’t say “w” just 500 to avoid lawsuits, and it says maximum power for 12v + 5v + 3.3v will not exceed 400w or something… and only 1 pci-e power connector :lol:</p>

            <p>I find my onboard audio to plenty good enough for my needs. Of course, I’m only running 2.1 system, I don’t think you’d notice the difference between onboard and dedicated with only 2 drivers. Of course, I’ve read that surround setups and directional audio sound tinny on most onboard audio devices, although I’ve never actually experienced it.</p>
<p>As for brand name PSU’s, I know from personal experience that the PSU is the root of the stability of a PC. If your PSU is faulty, or outputting unstable voltages, you risk wrecking other stuff in your PC, particularly the motherboard and video card. When you buy brand name PSU’s, your chances of getting faulty or unstable units is significantly decreased. That is one place where you should spend your money and not cheap out.</p>
<p>Also, a note on wattage, a PC realistically will only use about 400 watts during normal use (gaming, working, whatever). Most people assume that the wattage is the only number they should look for on a PSU, but the more important factors are the amps supplied on the +12V, +5V, and +3.3V rails. A 500 watt PSU that pushes out 60 amps on it’s rails is much better than a 1000 watt PSU that only supplies 35 amps. As I stated before, I chose my PSU based on the rated amperage of the 12V rail. As an engineer, I can tell you that currents and voltages are much more important than watts. Watts are just a measurement of the energy used over a length of time, the number written on the box of the PSU is only a generalization of what you are looking for. You can think of the wattage as the size of engine in a car. A big engine is fine and dandy, but if it has hardly any horsepower (amps) then it won’t do you much good. The more horsepower, the better it will work, regardless of the size of engine. I suggest looking up benchmarks of potential PSU’s you are looking at and see what their amperage is on the 12V rail(s) before purchasing it.</p>

<p>Also, how’s the onboard audio for the ASUS P8P67?  Good enough to go without a dedicated sound card?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s onboard audio, so it depends on your needs. It’s not as awful as older integrated audio cards were, but it’s certainly not great. If you like lots of detail in your music or crystal clear audio, you’ll have to get a dedicated soundcard.</p>
<p>If you have or want to use a surround system (5.1 or 7.1), I’d recommend an Asus Xonar STX, or a DX if you don’t want to shell out that much money. With only two speakers, maybe it’s better to get a usb DAC, specially if you listen to music a lot. Have in mind that if you don’t have good speakers (that most of the times need a dedicated amp to drive them) no sound card in the world is going to make crappy speakers sound good. Just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>The possible problems with no-brand PSU’s IMO are three:<br>
-reliability (they may last way shorter than they should and/or fry other components in the process)<br>
-efficiency (which will make you spend more money in the long run)<br>
-output (many times, the output wattage advertised in the box is exchanged for the peak wattage, meaning that it doesn’t output constant wattage for your needs).</p>

<p>LOL, I was exaggerating a bit there.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  I’m currently running a P4 from '06 OC’d as high as it goes and it’s still very much alive. Can’t run games on hot summer days though.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>[EDIT] As for the PSU, I’ll have to say at least a decent one is a must. PSUs are the only components that have ever died on me (and not just one but three).</p>

<p>…which was my point. So how many cpus have you burned out? There is no point in having your cpu run at 30C so that it outlives your grandchildren. You’ll scrap it in a couple of years anyway.</p>

<p>To all the custom cooling enthusiasts - how many cpus have you actually burned out?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s pretty hard to burn a CPU, you’d have to exceed the thermal threshold quite a lot (for Intel CPU’s that’s about 91 C if I remember correctly). Custom cooling is not primarily about preventing your CPU from getting fried, but to prolong its lifespan. Low temperatures also allow for a much higher overclock. Intel i7’s are known to be excellent overclockers, you can get a lot of extra performance out of the CPU without extra spending money. Custom cooling usually also means better airflow inside the case and a lower overall temperature for the motherboard (motherboards really hate heat).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got my AMD Phenom II X4 970 at 3.7, idle temps 36-38c. in games 40c-45c.<br>
Of course, I’m not saying stock coolers are good, but not every stock cooler is totally useless. (still recommending a custom cpu cooler)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Depends on room temperature, dust in the heat sink, age of the CPU etc. Try stressing your CPU with Prime95 and check the temperatures after 10 minutes of number crunching (it’s usually used to check for overclocking stability).</p>
