    <description>Not sure if this thread is needed or allowed or whatever, but if it is then feel free to post serious questions here and I&#39;ll answer them as thoroughly as I can.

For anyone unfamiliar with the term &quot;agnostic&quot;, or how I define it:
[quote=Princeton WordNet]
Agnostic: a person who claims that they cannot have true knowledge about the existence of God (but does not deny that God might exist)
[/quote]
Also including a poll, because I&#39;ve seen people say that you&#39;re either religious or atheist and can&#39;t be anything in between and am wondering who agrees with that.

EDIT: Typo in poll question, forgot the word &quot;is&quot;, sorry</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Why would I ask an agnostic? Agnostics don’t <span class="bbcode-i">know</span> anything.</p>
<p>…get it? Cuz, like, agnosticism is the philosophical stance that one cannot “know.”</p>
<p>Awful shenanigans aside, a true agnostic is technically an atheist because they don’t affirm a belief in god. In fact, most atheists I know are agnostic as well. The terms aren’t mutually exclusive. But agnosticism isn’t a branch of atheism, if that’s what the OP means. The two are only related with regards to one question: is there a God?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I beg to differ. Saying the Earth was flat was more like saying pi is “about 7”  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  when you had all the evidence and tools required to prove that pi is actually around 3.1. Early evidence of the curvature of the Earth is the fact that when a ship approaches from sea the first thing you see is it’s mast. If the Earth were flat the entire boat could be seen from any distance, just smaller or larger depending on how far away the boat is. Calling the Earth flat was “wrong” not just because it was inaccurate, but also because the tools and evidence of the time provided a much more accurate answer. Calling the Earth flat was not a failure of science but a failure of society for imposing it’s inaccurate beliefs onto scientists.</p>
<p>Now of course this is just one particular instance, and after writing all this I realized it was entirely pointless because for other more fitting examples your description of science works well.</p>
<p>I think that the belief that everything spun around the Earth, though also marred by society’s restrictions, is a better example. In the very early days it would be a fair assumption that stars and the Sun rotated around Earth because if you watched them, they seemed to do exactly that. But with the telescope and more accurate astronomy, it became obvious that the Earth rotated around the Sun.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well good science should never really change. The process of observing is always evolving and thus the implications of the observations change.  For the most part, our observations don’t change what is true. What changes is our ability to observe and the quality of our deductions based on these observations. The scientific method doesn’t change, just the tools used for observation and our abilities to analyze this data. To deny the many successes of science because of current limitations is silly.</p>
<p>I personally agree that anything suggested without evidence CAN be dismissed without evidence. The analogy was used that we don’t have evidence of life on other planets. However there HAS been evidence there the whole time. As our tools of analysis have evolved, the strength of the evidence has increased. I can’t think of an example where it wouldn’t be reasonable to dismiss something without evidence to support the claim. The more grandiose the claim the more this line of reasoning comes to the forefront.</p>
<p>Because we are finite beings with finite minds we will likely be agnostic for the foreseeable future. However, this is unrelated to the realm of theism and atheism. I just hope we can avoid the discussion where people debate the meaning of words. Oh boy, does THAT get stupid quick.</p>

<p>Same reason I don’t decide that the entire world can be explained through religion. Science is a “religion” I believe in because there are explanations to back up theories that actually make sense to me, but that in no way means that I say that everything in science is set in stone. Scientist once thought the world was flat, right?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Excuse me for a moment.  Just because previous scientists were “wrong” doesn’t mean that they were WHOLLY wrong.</p>
<p>They took the evidence available to them and came up with a conclusion.  Later, with more evidence, they refined the conclusions.  On a spheroid, when you look at it from the perspective of being on a very large one, it looks “mostly flat”.</p>
<p>No scientist says that “science” is set in stone.  Religion, however, does.</p>

            <p>The fact that people often twist their delusions into ridiculous things lke homophobia isn’t because delusions themselves are bad, but because the people making them are flawed. Having delusions of knowing the answer to life is perfectly fine as long as, like I said, you don’t impose them upon others.</p>

<p>What’s wrong with delusions and fantasies? Whether we know the truth or not is irrelevant, we can’t do anything with that knowledge but satisfy our own desires. If fantasy satisfies people’s desires for the answers and they believe it to be true I see no problem with that, as LONG as they don’t impose it on those that aren’t OK with those delusions.</p>

</aside>
<p>I feel that when you accept delusions and fantasies and allow them to go unchallenged it very often leads to unnecessary conflict. Lets look at abortion. It is my belief that women should be allowed to choose to have an abortion. Many Christians might decide based of their religion that abortion is a moral abomination and a great injustice to the aborted fetus. So even if this Christian always does his bestest not to step on toes and to keep his fantasies from interfering with other’s truths or fantasies, is morally obligated by his delusion to step in on behalf of the fetus. Whether or not you object to abortion and whether or not you are Christian, take this situation as hypothetical, and see that it applies to any situations such as Islamic terrorism gay bashing The Crusades etc. And the only difference between the delusions you are okay with and the delusions you aren’t is that the latter just happen to disagree with the truth in a way that demands action.</p>
<p>Also, the most immediately comforting answer, religion, isn’t necessarily the best one. For example, someone who has lost someone close might choose to deny that that person has ever even died. To pretend that that person is still alive. This is comforting at first but just leads to trouble just as religion can be a false comfort by hiding the truth.</p>

<p>And garthbartin, I never said science and religion are the same. When I said I believe in the religion of science, I meant that science answers many of the same questions religion aims to answer, that’s all.</p>
<p>And gugamilare, thats fine, any contributions are appreciated haha. Nice to see a good debate going on here.</p>

</ol>

</aside>
<p>May I give a different view? I’ve seen a lecture explaining that actually the sets of beliefs of a religion is a virus (like a computer virus), the belief passes on from generation to generation. It’s not that the “belief” was “corrupted” by men, but it mutates as it passes from one person to another - that is expected in any kind of talk. Then competition and natural selection takes place to “choose” the religions and beliefs that are more “contagious”.</p>
<p>In other words, it is not that the belief was used for evil purposes, but sometimes the belief evolves to something evil, which sometimes make it more contagious.</p>
<p>I warn anyone that wants to watch the video that it is (not intentionally) offensive to religious people, and that might make you angry if you are religious. In any case, the whole lecture is in the following video:<br>

There is also a talk in the channel Atheist Experience (a “short version” of the video above):<br>

<p>Anyway, sorry to bump into your thread, russilker, I’m not agnostic.</p>

<p>Same reason I don’t decide that the entire world can be explained through religion. Science is a “religion” I believe in because there are explanations to back up theories that actually make sense to me, but that in no way means that I say that everything in science is set in stone. Scientist once thought the world was flat, right?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Science differs heavily from religion. Science is logic reason and evidence while religion is faith and emotions. Also, there is science and then there is human science. Science is the functions and laws and processes that govern the universe. Human science is our understanding of science. Human science is flawed and incomplete. As time progresses human science becomes more and more complete and less and less flawed. It is my opinion that we have gotten to the point that human science is complete enough to call it more or less “correct” and call it the answer to the universe and it’s functions.</p>
<p>Scientists thought the world was flat for many reasons. To name two; to say otherwise lead to social ridicule and it had been imprinted deeply in their brains that the Earth was flat leading them to ignore evidence to the contrary (they made their conclusions before fairly analyzing the evidence). Calling the Earth flat was a social failure more than a scientific failure; the scientist’s false conclusions were more based of what society had forced upon them than what the scientific process would lead them to believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I care about people doing what is personally right for them, and not following a religion because they were born into it.  Than means doing some inner searching.  If you are an atheist at heart, so be it.  If you are a hardcore Christian, I don’t necessarily agree because Christianity has been twisted to serve man over the centuries, but that’s your business.</p>
<p>Just don’t try to push it towards other people because they, too, must find what lies within themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But you do agree that there is ONE right answer? That all these people with all their theories and beliefs are wrong? And that there is something that is right? Do you not care that all these things people are “finding int heir hearts” are just illusions and fantasies? Illusions and fantasies that can lead to negative beliefs and acts such as gay hate anti-abortion and terrorism to name some of the extremes?</p>

<p>Why? Unless you disagree with some fundamental part of agnosticism (there isn’t really much to it), why can’t it describe you? Unless you just hate labels in general, which is another story</p>
