    <title>Sacrifice Update, and new games in my lbrary! Help!</title>

    <description>Ok, steam is being really, really weird with me.
First of all, a couple of weeks ago, wheni bought episode 1, steam also gave me half life source, and half life deathmatch? As far as i know, theyre unplayable.

I ignored it, and left it there.

Now today, steam would not downloadthe sacrifice update, and i was getting totally pissed. Now in my blind fury, i double clicked half life deathmatch, and steam stopped responding for a bit, then it came back, and started doing the l4d2 update (i only have l4d2) thing is, the update is 3 gigs :l ( i think it may be dling l4d2 all over again, even though i never removed the game) 
well anyways, any help?</description>

            <p>Half life source also does it on mine, like 200mb/800mb, this is because it has shared files from source content on the current half life games, such as episode 1 or 2.</p>

            <p>Most likely you received the extra games when purchasing EP1 as a bonus of some sort. Try installing them, they’ll probably work. And steam has been tweaking out because the servers are overloaded. The update is actually 3 gigs so you’ll just have to wait.</p>
