    <title>No Chapter Title - Lambda Core [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-chapter-title-lambda-core-fixed/10958</link>
    <description>One thing I noticed on my first playthrough was that there was never a proper &quot;title&quot; for Lambda Core.  I also noticed the same thing happen during Podcast 17&#39;s playthrough as well.  I even went back and started a new game from Lambda Core and saw no &quot;Lambda Core&quot; chapter title appear anywhere.  Don&#39;t know if this was an over site or intentional though.  And I haven&#39;t seen anyone else mention it either.</description>

            <p>Don’t recall if I saw a chapter title myself or not.</p>
<p>Although, to be fair… there is a giant sign as you walk into the place reading LAMBDA CORE. Maybe they thought it would’ve been a bit silly if you had a text overlay saying what was already in huge letters before you.</p>

            <p>One thing I noticed on my first playthrough was that there was never a proper “title” for Lambda Core.  I also noticed the same thing happen during Podcast 17’s playthrough as well.  I even went back and started a new game from Lambda Core and saw no “Lambda Core” chapter title appear anywhere.  Don’t know if this was an over site or intentional though.  And I haven’t seen anyone else mention it either.</p>
