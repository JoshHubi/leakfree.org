    <title>Not working on Windows 8 (permission issues)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/not-working-on-windows-8-permission-issues/9490</link>
    <description>Fix that worked for me:
-------------------------
Run Steam as Administrator (does not help that you have UAC turned off, you need to run Steam as Administrator anyways)
Then start BMS again
-------------------------

I am running Windows 8 professional (as part of the Microsofts DreamSpark service, I have access to Windows 8 before most others)

Black Mesa does no run properly on my computer, due to the fact that the mod does not have permission/access to change/write files in it&#39;s own directory (permissions have been updated in Win8 compared to Win7). 

In the console you can read many errors regarding not beeing able to create/change config files etc. It is also not possible to save any games or configs.

Also more importantly the game crashes after the first minute during the first Loading sequence!</description>

<p>Unfortunately, we are using an engine built prior to windows 8 and are unable to make any engine changes as we are a mod. You will have to contact valve or steam on these issues.</p>
<p>You can also try running the game with administrator privileges.</p>
