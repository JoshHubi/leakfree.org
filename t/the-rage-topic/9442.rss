            <p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/u/geekofalltrades">geekofalltrades</a> Obviously I am not your mom, however your rant does hit home. My oldest is 32 and is unattached. It bugs me to hell that he isn’t “settled” but maybe it is cuz I want all my kids “settled” before I kick the bucket. Your rant reminds me that I need to calm down and let my kids enjoy life as their path takes them rather than me getting uptight about them not being married.  Go easy on him bro. He just loves you so much he wants to make sure you are happy.</p>

            <p>Fucking schnitzelwafts.</p>
<p>My father just sent me a patronizing email with a clipped advice column from the paper about not getting disheartened and giving up on dating. This is just the latest in a common, long-running (since I was a teenager) refrain.</p>
<p>Apparently, as a 30 year old man, it is now time for me to be in a relationship.</p>
<p>This is the same man who, by the way, when I was in my first long-ish term relationship in college, told me over the phone to not get too tied to the first woman I met. That if she and I ended up sticking it out, he’d be “the happiest man at the wedding, <em>but…</em>” I doubt he even realizes. Real SelfAwarewolf. Oh, also, she happened to be sitting next to me on the couch and could hear what he was saying, and that turned into a fun breakdown after I got off the phone.</p>
<p>I’m perfectly happy alone – much more happy and centered, in fact, than when I was still trying to be a “normal,” social person. My choice to not date or pursue relationships is not due to any lack of self-confidence or self-esteem, or to disillusionment with the process. I’ve explained this to him multiple times.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to have to put my foot down and chastise my dad for the first time, and it’s tying me in knots a bit.</p>

 Cancer immunotherapy (sometimes called immuno-oncology) is the artificial stimulation of the immune system to treat cancer, improving on the immune system's natural ability to fight the disease. It is an application of the fundamental research of cancer immunology and a growing subspeciality of oncology.
 Cancer immunotherapy exploits the fact that cancer cells often have tumor antigens, molecules on their surface that can be detected by the antibody proteins of the immune system, binding to th...</p>

<p>so sorry to hear that it’s back. Reading this, it does sound like you are having a hard time. I do wish to do the same as CPU and send a big, long and warm hug. You have been through so much already, haven’t you?</p>
<p>Hugs are much more often so much better than any words. But if there’s is anything you would like us to say, please don’t hesitate to tell us. We’d love to give something back, if wished, as you already shared this with us. And I am very grateful for that!</p>

            <p>If <a class="mention" href="/u/cpu">@CPU</a> 's advice of flashing the BIOS doesn’t help (seeing as the mobo was replaced, I’m not 100% certain that’ll help), and you’ve checked that your RAM is not only working but also in the right slot(s) in your motherboard, I agree that the peripherals or the dirty power are what I’d look at next.</p>
<p>SEMI-RELATED STORY TIME INTERLUDE!</p>
<p>I recently started playing Rocksmith again, which if you don’t know, is a game where you plug a real guitar into your PC (or console) via a jack -&gt; USB cable and play along (kinda like Guitar Hero, but more advanced). I noticed this annoying buzzing sound, which also registered on the screen as input so I know I wasn’t imagining things, which I figured out after a while stopped if I touched one of the strings. Or, as it turned out, any metal bit on the guitar.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m fairly sure is happening; the wall socket my PC is plugged into isn’t grounded. The noise in the current running through the PSU, into my motherboard, then the USB cable and then my guitar was big enough to actually be audible unless I touch a metal bit of the guitar and act as the grounding myself.</p>
<p>In short; your PSU can’t filter out all the noise of the incoming power.</p>
<p>How this related to your story; I’d indeed try to disconnect the peripherals, see what happens. In particular the two things that are connected to power aside from your PC: speakers (usually) and your monitor. If you expect dirty power, you may have a reason to, and as I just explained the resulting noise may reach further than expected. Who knows, maybe it’s interfering with each other.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I have 0 reason to believe this will have any effect… but after what happened with my guitar, it wouldn’t surprise me either.</p>

            <p>not much point as the system is going to get replaced soon’ish anyway, the old i5 is getting too sluggish and my hd6570 is also dying (bad fan bearing).<br>
So I’m just going to run the wheels off it till it finally dies.</p>

            <p>Did, that was the best info I could find, I’ve noticed it does it far more frequently if I pull out the gpu, if I overclock it, it stops dying.<br>
It’s the most backwards thing I’ve dealt with, and I haven’t seen anything on google about it besides Dell support and the post code sheet saying one of the two is dead/dying, probably mobo.<br>
It’s a Optiplex 980 ssf if you want to give a crack at it, I gave up two months ago.</p>

            <p>Most Dells either have  built in diagnostics or a web based version you can run. Google the model for more instructions.</p>

            <p>I have a similar issue with my optiplex, I’ll be doing something and then it just freezes with a flashing orange one on the from panel, sometimes after I reset it it just turns on and off infinity unless it’s unplugged for at least a day then It will work again.<br>
According to Dell, the flashing “1” means two things, 1) dead power supply or 2) a dead mother board.<br>
And I have no way to figure out what of the two it is, so now I’m waiting on my computer to produce magic smoke at any time.</p>

            <p>I’ve posted about it before and have basically given up on fixing it at this point. What happens is that I hit the power button, and the fans all spin up to full speed, and the PC does not boot. It just sits there, with fans spinning, forever. It appears that the motherboard doesn’t even make it to POST. Then I have to hard power off the PC and try again. On a good day, it boots on the next try, but on a bad day, it fails to boot four or five times before finally booting. This doesn’t happen every time, but often enough that it’s annoying; probably a solid 50% of the time.</p>
<p>I have replaced the case, PSU, motherboard, CPU, CPU cooler, RAM, videocard, all the case fans, all the cabling, the secondary HDD, the powerstrip, and just now have replaced the SSD hosting the OS. The only part I haven’t replaced is my audio card, but I’ve pulled that out of the PC for weeks at a time and still had the problem happen. I think I also updated the motherboard BIOS, although I can’t remember if that was this motherboard or the last one.</p>
<p>I have not changed any/many of the peripherals. I’ve changed monitors since this all started, and have swapped between two 360 controllers (one wireless and one wired). I have not changed my speakers, mouse, keyboard, mic, or headphones. That could be interesting to try unplugging components until after boot. I wouldn’t have guessed that a peripheral could cause it, but once you’ve eliminated all other possibilities, whatever remains, however unlikely, must be the truth.</p>
<p>The only other theory I have left is that maybe my apartment has really dirty power, and that’s what’s causing it? I don’t have the equipment or the expertise to check that.</p>

            <p>So new mb, psu, ram, gpu, cpu, dvd drive, mouse, kb and case usb ports?<br>
Are all the component on the motherboard manufacturers approved list.<br>
Is the mb bios updated?<br>
Brand new parts can also be bad out of the box.</p>
