    <title>CoD 4 sometimes running in slow motion</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cod-4-sometimes-running-in-slow-motion/1652</link>
    <description>Recently I&#39;ve been experiencing some problems with Call of Duty 4. 
It always used to work fine, but now suddenly it sometimes runs in slowmotion.
The framerate doesn&#39;t drop, but I just run slow, shoot slow, and everything slows down. And this happens with random intervalls it seems. When I was running after captain Price it did happen, but in the firefight before that it didn&#39;t happen.
My pc is more than capable of running CoD4. And it never really drops below 60FPS on full.

My specs:
-Gigabyte UD3R
-Intel Core i7, oc&#39;ed to 3,6ghz (Can it have something to do with the overclock?)
-4gb ram, 1600mhz (I know, I know, should&#39;ve taken 6, stupid mistake)
-Ati Radeon 4870x2 2048mb
-WD Caviar Black 640gb
-Cooler Master Real Power 700w
-Windows XP 32bit, sp3

Anyone have an idea what might cause this, and how to fix it?</description>

It was hyper threading that was causing the problems.<br>
I tried disabling all cores and hyper threading and it worked!<br>
Then all cores enabled, and only hyper threading enabled, and it still works fine.</p>

<p>ah daar was ik nooit op gekomen. netjes<br>
ik draai de source engine gewoon op 64 bit hoor … niks geen problemen.</p>

Ik zie dat je uit nederland komt dus nederlands is wat makkelijker… oke ik zou zeggen dat het aan de atikaart ligt .  er zijn vaker spellen die zitten te kutten met de atikaart zorg ervoor dat die goed is ge-update ook catalyst kan daar mee helpen.</p>
<p>heb je de hitte al gecontroleerd van je processor? . misschien dat die te ver belast word als je alles op high speelt en automatisch terugschakelt.</p>
<p>heb je het spel al proberen te draaien onder veilige modus met internet verbinding? dan kan je meteen zien of het probleem door een software conflict komt of niet…</p>
<p>en waarom maak je gebruik van xp 32 bit … die kan geheugen-matig niet verder dan 3GB</p>
<p>iig succes er mee![/Dutch]</p>

            <p>How about experimenting with the core affinity? You know making it run on only one core for instance.</p>

            <p>Yes, I tried reverting it back to it’s old state. But that didn’t help either.<br>
I have Crysis and Warhead, never experienced any problems with that. With and without overclock.</p>
<p>tiki-dog: Where did you see it was overheating? Because it’s not. I’ve done more than enough stress testing to know it’s doing fine. So unless Call of Duty makes my CPU run at 120%, there’s no way it’s overheating.</p>
<p>And where did I build my pc wrong? Enlighten me.</p>

            <p>The simple fact of the matter is: Your cpu is overheating, so it turns down cpu usage to cool down the cpu it self, making everything all slow and at a dropped fps. This happened to me in CoD 6, and Batman: AA. Once I used an air blower (the kind you use to pump air into tires) and held it back from my laptop so it didnt screw up the keys, I just blew it through the bottom, pushing all this crap up from my keyboard like dust, and dandruff (I need to wash my hair  :retard <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  onto my laptop screen. I now use a cloth that I put over my keyboard.</p>
<p>What I learned: I left my laptop on alot downloading torrents[/SIZE] overnight and my laptop cpu fan is NOT made for filtering large amounts of dust. It clogged and made things go very slow.</p>
<hr>
<p>ANOTHER REASON:</p>
<p>You built your pc wrong, and overclocked too much <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I see you overclocked your CPU. Did you try to revert it back to its original state? I suppose you unlinked the FSB and RAM as to only max out your FSB frequency?<br>
BTW Is that DDR3? I’m somewhat out of the loop and have to still mess with DDR2  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I got similar slow downs you’re describing in a couple of games, and the cause was the CPU. The tension was too low maybe that’s a possible cause? Do you have any other CPU intensive games you could test? (Crysis coming to mind)</p>
<p>EDIT: I was looking around and it seems you’re not alone. You may check the temperature of your GFX cards on full load and try to Alt+Tab out of the game and back again once the problem appears.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip.<br>
I doubt that it’s another program. It’s possbile of course, but I also use Game Booster these days. Which basicly shuts down everything you don’t need.<br>
However, I will still check it out.</p>

<p>Afraid I did both of that to no avail.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions though guys.</p>
<p>I now have MW2, and it has the exact problem. And this is really starting to piss me off.<br>
I noticed it has to do with framerates too. Checked it in fraps. It shows some spectacular drops. Really strange, irregular, unlogical drops. I’m talking from 100+ to suddenly ~30 for no appearant reason. No change of scenery, no adition of certain effects or enemies. Just random.</p>
<p>If anyone even has the slightest clue it’d be greatly apreciated.<br>
(Also: It worked fine the first day I tried it, but the second day for some reason it went back to that. And sometimes it seems to happen in certain levels. I can’t tell why though.)</p>
