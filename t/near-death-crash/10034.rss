    <title>Near death crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/near-death-crash/10034</link>
    <description>This has happened to me twice now. I&#39;m being shot to death and the game hangs as soon as I hit 1HP. It stutters a bit and then crashes to desktop. &quot;HL2.exe has stopped working&quot;. The first time it happened from a sentry gun the very first time you encounter them. I died the same way a few times afterwards and the crash only happened once. The second time was during the chopper fight in surface tension right after you get the rocket launcher. I&#39;m sure the chopper fight will go fine once I try it again, but I decided to file this report instead of relaunching the game.

The dump provided is from the most recent crash with the chopper.
