            <p>At the end of the day, it’s what you are used to, isn’t it? If you used the controller and mouse around the same time, for the same amount of time, then you would probably think the controller was better for racing games.</p>
<p>I agree with your ‘third-person’ point, shooting games are almost always better on the mouse/keyboard. However, platformers and all alike are almost always better on a controller.</p>

            <p>While I agree that the gamepad is better for racing games, I learnt my racing skillz through the keyboard, thus can kick the ass of most people through it. I’m crappy with a gamepad, so I don’t use them.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I do, however, find 3rd person games are almost always better with a gamepad. Except when you have to shoot in the game (Splinter Cell). Shooting with a gamepad is a not-so-pleasant experience. :S</p>
<p>Does anyone else find the keyboard better for racing? Or is it just me.</p>

            <p>Looks terrible and uncomfortable. Why not just buy a gamepad (PS3 or Xbox 360 whatever you choose) and plug that into your USB drive and call it a day. Save the Keyboard and mouse for FPS’s and RTS’s and use the gamepad with games like Splinter Cell, Assassin’s Creed and any racing game???</p>
