        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>To each their own haha but to me, Plato was trying to convey the message that reality is a taught thing and not a natural thing that has always been. Going off nature versus nurture, we are nurtured to believe that blue is blue. In nature, blue could actually be anything. Blue is merely the name we gave it, and that is something that is then taught in the shadows on the wall before people who don’t strive to make their own reality (I.e the prisoner that is freed and learns of a new reality before returning to the cave being adventurous discoverers versus the ignorant, chained prisoners)</p>
<p>On a side note, I think the freed prisoners death is what Plato sees in the changing of reality. The masses, tied into their belief of others teachings and not into their learning of new, undiscovered things shun the newer ideas. Ideas such as the Heliocentric theory, the world being round, etc weren’t really believed until the death of those that set out to prove it true. As they’re dead, they join the mass of puppet masters and teach their reality (now accepted) and so on.</p>
<p>In a way, we are both kind of saying the same thing in two different ways. You’re saying that our perceived reality, according to Plato, could be a lie. I’m saying that our perceived reality is made up by countless people and taught to others unwilling to discover on their own the truth of the world and that we only accept things as they are because we are taught them, regardless of fact or fiction.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I would go ahead and say that nothing exists in our perceived reality. In a philosophical sense, perceived reality and actual reality are supposed to be inseparable, but we don’t live in purely constructed philosophical world. We understand (or the smart ones do) that the reality we perceive does not accurately reflect what the world really is. We know that there are colors out there that we simply don’t have the capacity to observe with our own eyes, and yet, we know that it really does in fact exist.</p>
<p>Plato’s story about the cave, as I interpreted it, didn’t mean that reality doesn’t exist at all. I thought it meant that your perceived reality could all be a lie. It means that the reality you call yours is not necessarily universal. That being said, it never invalidates the notion that there is a single truthful reality. It’s a similar claim in the eyes of the individual, but it is an important distinction to make.</p>

            <p>Well all reality is perceived through education. Like with Plato’s Allegory of the Cave from The Republic, the prisoners merely see what is taught to them by the puppet masters. With that in mind, line segments exist in the sense that someone came up with that idea, made a shadow puppet out of it (education) and now it is common knowledge that lines exist in segments and in infinite amounts.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, nothing exists. Our understanding exists, which creates a reality in which things “exist”. But nothing in reality is concrete. If the entire human race forgot what the color blue looks like, anyone with the desire to discover a new reality could say it’s something entirely different from the blue it was known as.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, that story and that book make me think and question a whole lot of things in life.</p>

            <p>Yes, I know that this thread is DED, but who cares? Who even really reads the post dates? Anyway, on topic: Life makes me think. What’s the meaning of it? (If you say 42, I’ll kill you.) Looking at other people’s actions, knowing they have lives, families, their own problems, that makes me think.<br>

<p>The brain has no nociceptors (pain receptors) inside it, so there is no way you could feel pain, because there is neither a trigger nor a pathway, thus no processing of the “pain” information is possible: pain is only an elaboration of you brain, an “idea”.<br>
Inside the skull, nociceptors are located only on the meninges, the membranes that envelops the brain: <span class="bbcode-i">those </span>require an anaesthetic, but once you passed them you don’t need anaesthesia anymore.</p>
<p>On topic:</p>
<p>The complexity of life. Biological and psychological.<br>
And how it is impossible to predict the outcome of… anything. Especially in social relationships. There is too much variability in the world. Everything and everyone is unique, and the way each of this “uniques”, with their own incredible complexity, interact with other “uniques” in a million of possible ways is… well, you got the idea.</p>
<p>Actually, it’s more me staring in awe at all this. If I really had to carefully think about it, I would get insane in a matter of days.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>What currently makes me think, is the fact taht every time I try or even think I fail at something or everything I set out to do. I can not get a job. I can not do anything really. Life sucks and is pointless.</p>

            <p>She was talking very slurred, and with her head in a brace and an oxygen mask on. I think that she was just barely conscious.</p>

<p>That’s really fascinating. I was watching a video in Psychology the other day where someone was undergoing brain surgery. She was fully conscious for most of it, and would talk with the nurses and talk about what she felt or did when they used electrodes on certain parts of her brain.</p>
