    <title>Console commands to improve performance?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/console-commands-to-improve-performance/9914</link>
    <description>Hi! Your work is amazing, i love the mod. I have a good PC but not a very good graphics card, a Nvidia 6150SE NForce 430 512mb, so i can&#39;t get a decent frame-rate all the time, even on the lowest settings...
 So, my question is: Are there commands who can help to improve performance?
Thanks.</description>

Posted a thread like 5 minutes ago with explaining, but to be honest u might need to buy a better graphics card.</p>
