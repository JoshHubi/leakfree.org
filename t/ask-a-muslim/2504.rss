    <description>I don&#39;t know why my first thread got deleted but anyways ,as I said before : after the events of 11\9 people started to Hijack in an unbelievable ways Islam and muslims all around the world and for what ? &quot;just because there are certain group &quot;AL-Qaeda&quot; Blow up and kill innocent people even Muslims ,that doesn&#39;t mean they represent Islam or Muslims. if you have any questions regarding Islam I&#39;ll be more than Glad to answer &quot;with my personal experience and knowledge&quot;


p.s Please people keep it Civil and be open-minded


edit : oh BTW Muslims believe in evolution and science but not that Humans were evolved from Apes</description>

            <p>i wonder how the rates  of deaths via plain ol domestic violence in other cultures compare to whats reported in the west as honour killings. not saying its all made up but misogyny is a global problemo.<br>
saudi arabia has some of the worst womens rights in the world and they are bffs w. the usa so it can hardly be used to excuse basically anything they do anway</p>

<p>why should anyone wait and why would views change by themselves…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I didn’t say wait. I said it would be slow. Public media is influenced by public opinion, which is based on societal pressure. It’s not really okay to make a flagrantly racist movie about black people. Do you think that happened overnight? Do you think that societies view changed because it was changed by media? No media changed as society changed. You can’t approach this backward.</p>
<p>They key is to influence the society that creates the media and public opinion. Awareness is a great start, but like I said it will be slow.</p>

<p>Too many people actually believe this. When was the last time all Hell broke loose when someone depicted Jesus in an unfavorable light in a political cartoon, for example? Muslims just seem to be unable to take criticism of their religion.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think the point of the discussion relates to their anger about religion in this instance. I think the point of concern is more about depicting them in a negative light generally as a people.</p>
<p>In this respect, I would say that yes, muslim/islamic  people are portrayed negatively in the media. It’s a negative stereotype, and negative stereotypes are bad. This is how the media works though. To say there isn’t honest depictions of muslim/islamic people in any form of media isn’t true. Is there a bunch that do? Well, yeah.

Media is FULL of negative stereotypes. muslim/islamic people aren’t special. How many movies have an angry black guy? a folksy drunken irishman? a snobby frenchman?</p>
<p>Should it be done? No. Is it bad? Yes. Should it change? Yes. Will it? Probably eventually. But it depends on societal factors. Societal views change slowly. I wouldn’t hold your breath. Yeah it sucks, I agree there.</p>
