<p>I’m loving all the ignorant responses, by people that choose to ask; in very sarcastic ways about the actions of Muslims, and not about Islam. First of all when you want to ask about violent actions of Islam, first why don’t we have a comparison first, from the countries that are so… well civilized?</p>
<p>Which country dropped two atomic bombs on civilians?<br>
Which country used ‘Agent Orange’ killing hundreds of thousands, only to create half a million future birth defects<br>
Which country illegally invaded Iraq?</p>
<p>What about Guantanamo? Abu Gharib?<br>
What about White Phosphorus bombs?<br>
What about allying, and arming ruthless dictators around the world?<br>
What about countless stories of rape, and torture?</p>

<p>You know what, not everybody believes that Americans are the good guys who save the world every time (maybe they saved our asses in the WWII from Nazis, but shortly after they sold us to Commies - bastards  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ).

Hmmm, when dictators America and others put in place don’t act accordingly, they start wars, the UN some how got a crazy idea to literally throw out all of the Palestinians out of their homes and say “It’s the Jews homes now!”, they decided to throw away our entire government and put vicious monarchs, which torture people for even speaking against the government.</p>
<p>Those who rebel, are terrorists…right?<br>
Learn your facts people.</p>

<p>You must distinguish action of country leaders from actions of single men. The moral standards among group of people determines how civilized they are.

<p>Well I’m not attacking any part of you, rather I’m attacking the ones who propagate fear against Muslims. Again realize my points are aimed at proving the point, that calling Islam, or Muslims violent, is like saying the kid who punched the bigger stronger guy back after being hit by him, is the violent one. That’s why I brought up all the points from wars, that not only the USA participated in but also, USSR, UK, France, Italy, and now all the countries of NATO in attacking places like Iraq, and Afghanistan.

<p>And that’s a grave mistake. It’s like here in the USA,  there’s two major cable news networks, MSNBC, and FOX News, one is staunchly liberal, the other staunchly conservative, one loves Obama, the other hates him, so learning Islam or what Muslims do from American and Western Media (Countries at war with Muslim countries) is like trying to learn facts about liberals from fox news or vice versa, you’ll just hear distorted facts.</p>

<p>This is kinda my point, by the way, the ‘Hitlerization’ of people. Regardless who says it, it proved to be right, in fact Stalin proved it himself! He killed the same as hitler!

</aside>
<p>I agree, every single fighter on the face of the planet <span class="bbcode-b">is a terrorist</span>; someone who instills terror in the enemy. So every American, Briton, French, Islamist, Christian, Hindu, Chinese, fighter, will terrorize someone. Is it good, no? Is was sometimes needed, unfortunately yes. Because you don’t know the Qu’ran well, I’ll show you one verse, which sums up Islams stance on wars and it’s usage.</p>
<p>كُتِبَ عَلَيۡڪُمُ ٱلۡقِتَالُ وَهُوَ كُرۡهٌ۬ لَّكُمۡۖ وَعَسَىٰٓ أَن تَكۡرَهُواْ شَيۡـًٔ۬ا وَهُوَ خَيۡرٌ۬ لَّڪُمۡۖ وَعَسَىٰٓ أَن تُحِبُّواْ شَيۡـًٔ۬ا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ۬ لَّكُمۡۗ وَٱللَّهُ يَعۡلَمُ وَأَنتُمۡ لَا تَعۡلَمُونَ</p>
<p>Translation: Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows, and you know not.</p>
<p>People falsely assume, that Muslims want to fight, want to disrupt people’s way of lives, hell, even want to take over the west and forcibly convert them to Islam. If you read my previous posts, you’ll see the anger stemming from Muslims is from the simple fact all Islamic lands, were split apart, had foreign dictators put in, Monarchs, so-called ‘democracies’, and our way of life was stripped away from us. The oil rich lands we owned were bought, and the heroes of the west like Winston Churchill actually when going into Iraq in the early 1900s, advocated <span class="bbcode-b">using chemical weapons against Kurdish tribes</span> – the EXACT thing America, and Britain accuse Saddam (another dictator put in by them) of doing when they realized, oops, no WMDs.</p>
<p>That’s the reality of the Islamic lands today. Trust me, don’t listen to people like bush that they’re just so darned jealous of the western way of life, that’s the furthest from the truth.</p>
<p>I guess the general conclusion would be, ESPECIALLY at a time of war, how is it smart to listen to propaganda against Muslims? War in itself is terrorism, Americans, Spanish, Britons turn a blind eye to it all until it’s at their doorsteps, not realizing the middle east has it’s own 9/11 every day via uncle Sam.</p>
<p>Listen to Ron Paul for what I believe to be an accurate perspective from an American about these wars, he said it plain and simple, about these wars and stuff, they would leave the whoole western world 100 per cent alone, if they stopped robbing the middle east and Muslim lands of their rights.</p>
<p>Check this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7dnFDdwu0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7dnFDdwu0</a><br>
About 1:45 in he talks about the wars, and 9/11 &lt;-- If people got it like he did it I don’t think there’d be Islamophobia, the west wouldn’t have been attacked in the first place, and people could live the way they wanted.</p>
<p>Again sorry for dragging my posts out, it’s a complex issue that has many sides to it, but in a <span class="bbcode-i">Muslim - Everyone else</span> dialogue I think it’s the most crucial to talk about.</p>

</aside>
<p>Every faith says, all other faiths are doomed. We say, the former religions, are not valid, because there’s only one way to paradise, and you would agree, right.</p>
<p>Now, Islam also says, if one hears of Islam distorted, or had mental disabilities and did not have a sound mind, or never heard of Islam at all, they don’t get judged based on actions on earth, only those given a fair shot on this earth are judged for their actions here. So it’s not to say some Colombian tribe in the forest, are all doomed to hell. Not at all, and it’s not to say a Christian who believes in One God, all the prophets, and the message of Islam is doomed to hell, but if they hear of Islam like you have and reject it, then yes they will be judged on this earth.</p>
<p>The Islamic policy however is, we never say someones fate in the definite matter, because we don’t know what’s in their heart but as a criteria yes non Muslims wont go to heaven; but Christians BEFORE Islam could, Jews before Christianity could, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Those fears are well justified - see what happens in France, UK or Denmark. The immigrants that are cause of the fear are identified with Muslims, because how else should they be called? Maghrebians and Pakistans maybe?? And what about those death threats to the “enemies of Islam”? You must watch out not to say even a slight joke about Muhammad publicly, or else you can be dealing with the Muslim extremist. What happened with the freedom of speech? This is what you call a “Religion of Peace”? People from Islamic countries emigrate to Europe, build their Mosques here and impose their way of life.

Maybe a year after 9/11 there was some TV news report, but that’s all. Personally, for me more important were the terrorist attacks in Madrid and London than the attack in New York because of their proximity. I would also care much more about the attacks in Russia than in Africa, because for me Africa is kind of exotic continent.

<p>Right, because we are all in NATO, so it’s kind of our responsibility. As I can justify the attack on Afghanistan, because it was a retaliation for the 9/11 attack, I cannot find a just reason for attacking Iraq. There is probably much more behind the curtain than is visible to the public eye. And as I  previously said, we cannot leave now because it would cause a civil war in Iraq.</p>

<p>Those fears are well justified - see what happens in France, UK or Denmark. The immigrants that are cause of the fear are identified with Muslims, because how else should they be called? Maghrebians and Pakistans maybe?? And what about those death threats to the “enemies of Islam”? You must watch out not to say even a slight joke about Muhammad publicly, or else you can be dealing with the Muslim extremist. What happened with the freedom of speech? This is what you call a “Religion of Peace”? People from Islamic countries emigrate to Europe, build their Mosques here and impose their way of life. If they come here, they should assimilate with Europeans, not replace our culture with theirs.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wow, that’s a terrible way to look at it, you’re telling me we cannot build our Masaajid in your countries? Yet you cite other countries that imprison other people for insulting Islam. It’s the same thing really, same intolerance! Difference is these western countries say ‘We’re the freest nations on earth come flock to us!’, oh, but sorry you need to lose your identity too.</p>
<p>France, Britain DESTROYED and stole from the Islamic lands, now they have the audacity to impose laws against our religion? That’s disgusting. When they went into our lands they raped, tortured, and stole everything. Yet fear against Islam is… justified? Sir what world do you live in? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes–Picot_Agreement" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">French and British plan to conquer the middle east</a></p>
<p>Secondly when did I call Islam a religion of peace? Islam is a religion of Peace, War, Laws, Culture, basically everything in a society. Where did I say Islam doesn’t allow wars and such? Islam not only brought a faith to believe in but a system of governance, and a set of laws for wars, and peace, and peace treaties, it’s the whole nine yards, that’s what made it a complete religion in all aspects of life. So where did I call it a ‘religion of peace’, something these westerners use to contrast so called moderate (i.e., americanized, westernized Muslims) with so called extremists (i.e., fundamentalist).</p>
<p>And freedom of speach? Really? So what’s the difference that in the west you can insult anyone you want, any religion, any God, any race, groups like the KKK come about, skinheads, Black Gangs, Spanish Gangs, etc, but in America and the UK, and I’m sure in France and other western nations the biggest thing is to send spies into Mosques find a person say one thing against the respective country, only to have the person shipped to a secret prison on terrorism charges, and get tortured.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech, don’t make me laugh.</p>

<p>If NATO would leave Afghanistan now, it would probably ended with a civil war. I believe that the mission of NATO is important to the peace in that region.</p>

</aside>
<p>NATO is short lived, they have to leave some time, especially since they are being pummeled in Afghanistan, if USSR couldn’t beat an unorganized militia, imagine now, where they’re bigger, stronger more organized, and they say themselves they CANNOT get rid of the Taliban. That’s their own admissions, you think they’re helping anything? France was caught literally BRIBING the Taliban so they wont get attacked!</p>
<p>And so what if it ends in civil war, when it did the last time the Taliban took over, eradicated all of the opium trade, and until the USA wanted a natural gas line from Tajikstan going through Afghanistan, everything was fine. It’s all geopolitics buddy, nothing more. Propaganda, propaganda. It’s a shame really.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>The facts are that Muslim extremists are killing a lot of innocent people. This you call a distorted facts?</p>

<p>Um… YES. I know Pakistanis, I know Afghanis, I know Iraqis, do you really think like when a bomb hits a Pakistani market, that the Pakistanis blame the Taliban despite what the media says? They’re the first to say it was Blackwater USA, and India. The Taliban deny the attack, and there’s never proof Taliban did it. But who do you think the opposing side is going to say was responsible? No brainer right?</p>
<p>And I already pointed out, allll those countries of NATO, America, the UK, compare them to Muslim extremists, compare the numbers, the attack in Falluja Iraq, killed over 1000 civilians in one operation, Iraqi estimated 2 million iraqi children died directly and indirectly because of the war, they had an embargo on MEDICINES AND FOOD, in Iraq.</p>
<p>Based on what? LIES, to get OIL. But again Muslim kills 5 civilians, they’re so evil, American bomber kills one thousand by cluster bombing houses…eh. Right?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>This may be my ignorance, but can you tell me why terrorists hit in the WTC towers in the first place?</p>

</aside>
<p>Well from their mouths:</p>
<p>Retaliation for attacking Iraq in the 90s, basing US military in ‘Jazeera al Arab’ which is forbidden in our religion, supplying Israel with planes, guns, and money, America attacked Somalia, and had other operations in the region, the list goes on, and America was offered a truces on numerous occasions but the cocky “We don’t negotiate with terrorists” crap costs them lives.</p>
<p>Ron Paul explains it in that video I linked anyway, he basically says they attacked us because <span class="bbcode-b">WE’RE OVER THERE</span>. And it really is that simple believe it or not. It China decided to make a base in DC, arm Iran up with nukes so they could attack the USA, and so forth, I think Americans would be pretty pissed.</p>
<p>And if dropped two atom bombs for America on civilians can be justified because it ‘won the war’, why the double standard? Besides, as far as I could tell those were financial and infrastructural attacks on NYC, the subsequent loss of money was huge. That’s that explanation they give anyway, just saying, don’t think it’s baseless, “I hate your way of life” acts that the current administrations want people to believe. Last I checked all European countries, and the USA were offered many, many truces.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I have just read that in Pakistan a Christian was sentenced to life imprisonment because of gossips that he insulted Qur’an. Another propaganda?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m doing a lot of reiterating, but again, how on earth is Pakistan an Islamic country.</p>
<p>And again the double standard, check my first paragraph in my response. When the west puts spies in our mosques, tells us woman can’t wear a Hijab on government property including schools, and hospitals, tells us we cannot even make a minaret?! That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>You act like Muslims aren’t harassed here too, just becaues they go to Masjids and pray and grow a beard, they’re subject to questioning, and a lot of them out of no where were sent to places like guantanamo, including a 12 year old boy, he left guantanamo recently you can read up on him. Sad story. He never had a trial, was just send away tortured, water boarded, and such.</p>
<p>Funny thing is Muslims are not, and do not want to impose our life style on you, but the west took over our countries put in greedy dictators, and then they tell us not to practice our religion is we migrate to the west? If we had an Islamic country again, you wouldn’t need to worry about immigration. But an Islamic country is not in the financial interests of the first world countries now is it? The USA has laws against flag burning too, what’s the different? Give me a break the double standards go on and on and on.</p>
<p>Oh and I’m not asking anyone here to say yeah the Islamic way of life is superb, because it’s a way of life for Muslims just as your governments and ways of life are good for you. My point is theres two sides to every story and if you think its justified to split up Muslim countries for oil, destroy a way of life for people for over 1300 years, invade countries illegally, I mean, anyone can see that’s wrong. And sure Muslims do things wrong too, of course, but I just want to put both sides, side by side.</p>
<p>I just hope people understand it, if they like it or not, well that’s up to them.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>I think that we have here some little misunderstanding. I have nothing against Islam as a religion. I’m against people that come flooding in to Europe from Africa and some parts of Middle East who have completely different moral standards from Europeans. Mosques are just a visible sign that those people grow in a large number. Those people have completely different history and traditions than French people or Brits, that why French and UK is slowly loosing their identity. I can imagine that, for example, in 50 years from now France will be only a name on the map, people won’t care for the history of France because it won’t be their own history. Politics who let that happen should be send to guillotine. But why should I care, I’m not even from France. I just hope that my government won’t do the same mistake. Now France is waking up, that’s why they want to prohibit burkas and minarets. You know, here in Europe not everybody want to hear some guy calling to prayer every day. This is OUR right.</p>

<p>So they waited about 10 years to take their revenge??? They just couldn’t let it go? They knew that it will just inflame the conflict, but they did it anyway? So even if we leave Iraq, some day Taliban can just decide to take a retaliation on USA and Europe. For me that just a good reason to stay in Afghanistan, not to let the Taliban grow in power!</p>

<p>You must be blind not to see a difference here. If Pakistanis don’t want to have Christian churches, why don’t they make a law and destroy them? Instead, they choose a violent approach, they burn Christian houses and kill many Christians. Pakistanis give life sentence to Christians, while here, in Europe, nobody goes to prison because of personal believes. Still don’t get the difference?</p>

<p>I really wouldn’t have anything against practicing your religion by anyone if it didn’t stand so much out. Because of burkas there is this obvious division between “us” and “them” - Muslims just don’t integrate with locals because of that, these cultural differences are too big. Another thing are minarets - I don’t think that anybody must to call you for prayers, you should remember when to go to temple yourself. And the last one - breaks for prayers. I read somewhere that a bus driver in England stopped the bus because he had to pray and all the passengers had to wait until he finished. If he must pray at this specific moment, he should have taken a different shift. I don’t think it is fair that Muslim have some privileges only because of their religion.</p>

<p>Also, of course various Western countries have fucked up the middle east and it’s awful, but from what I read of your posts you seem to think they’re repressing all Mulsims within their borders.
