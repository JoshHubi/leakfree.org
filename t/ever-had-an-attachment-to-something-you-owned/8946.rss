    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ever-had-an-attachment-to-something-you-owned/8946</link>
    <description>I still have my Amiga 1200 in a box in my house with mouse and monitor.  Haven&#39;t powered it up in years, but I can&#39;t bring myself up to get rid of it.

Has anyone else had an attachment to something like this?  Is this crazy or what?</description>

            <p>Running shoes.</p>
<p>Good ones are hard to find, and once you get a nice pair and you’ve broken them in; nothing beats it. I had a pair of Nike’s that felt like heaven, and my mother thought they looked raggedy so she threw them away. Never had a better pair of shoes in my life.</p>
<p>EDIT: And also running shorts, those are truly the shit, and I still have a few pair from freshman year of high school.</p>

            <p>I do this with pretty much everything I own, especially things that have been given to me.</p>
<p>More than anything I’d say I hold my alarm clock, my bed lamp, my potted ivy, my collection of hats, and my tea mugs in especially high regard.</p>
<p>Beyond that I have piles of old shirts, underwear and random trinkets in my old house just lying about never to be even seen.</p>

            <p>I suppose I might be attached to a few things that have special meaning to me, but mostly I just have what Tolkien described as ‘mathoms’ - things for which I have no immediate use but that I am unwilling to just throw away. I mean, I could still make some money out of those car parts that have been sitting in the garage for years, and who knows when I might need this old firewire card?!</p>
<p>Also, I’ve accumulated a lot of e-waste that I don’t want to just throw in the garbage, but I’ve been too lazy too bother taking it to a recycler.</p>

            <p>I am not particularly sentimental.  Most of the useless things I keep are because if I were to get rid of my family would be upset.</p>

            <p>I still have my Amiga 1200 in a box in my house with mouse and monitor.  Haven’t powered it up in years, but I can’t bring myself up to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had an attachment to something like this?  Is this crazy or what?</p>
