    <title>Updated Closed Captions Mod Release</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/updated-closed-captions-mod-release/11856</link>
    <description>I&#39;m taking the plunge and giving something to the BM community, from which I&#39;ve taken so much from.

I&#39;ve initiated a project that focuses on finding and correcting the numerous dialog/subtitle caption errors that presently exist in BM. There are dozens of instances where the dialog that is spoken by the character in audio form is not accurately reflected in the subtitle caption that is displayed at the bottom of the screen in written form. Hopefully, this mod will deepen, however slightly, the immersion factor in BM.

More importantly, this project is especially beneficial to those individuals that are hearing impaired. In some circumstances, subtiltles are the only means by which they can understand what&#39;s transpiring in the game, assists them in determining the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to progress the game further, and helps them in more fully understanding and appreciating the gameplay and storyline.

I&#39;m just doing my little part in honing, polishing and improving BM to be as bug-free as it can possibly be. It&#39;s a very painstaking process, but one that I feel needs to be done. 

There is a detailed &quot;ReadMe&quot; in the zip file. Please thoroughly read it.

I&#39;ll endeavor to keep searching for additional errors and correct them as they are discovered, but this is a daunting task. After installing this mod, if you discover any additional errors, please report them here in this BM forum. Please provide me with as much info as possible so that I can easily zero in on the corrections that need to be applied. Typically, I require the game level/chapter, the character speaking (Barney, scientist, other) and as much of the spoken audio dialog as you can take note of. Once a sufficient number of new corrections are made, I&#39;ll release an updated version of the mod.

Thank you in advance for your invaluable contributions to this project.

Happy gaming everyone!
Dadster


Ps: A special shout out and thanks to forum contributor [COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]kyyrma, who helped with some questions I had concerning some of the mechanics involved.

</aside>
<p>I can do that. In fact, I’ve been working on updating Dadster’s Close Captions Mod. I’ll release it when it’s ready.</p>
<p>Edit: There will be 2 versions of it. One with Surface Tension Uncut captions and one with both ST Uncut and Uplink captions.</p>

            <p>It’s the small things like this that I appreciate the most as I notice them more than others, and it always irritated me that they were largely incorrect. Much appreciated for taking the time to do this for us. However, it doesn’t seem to work for me for some reason. I read the readme and did exactly as it said, but I simply don’t get anything on screen for captions. I’ve tried full captions, and only dialog, but neither do a thing for me. I backed up the old ones, so it’s no big deal, but any thoughts would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but – correct me if I’m wrong – we’re talking about the captions, not about the character dialogues itself. Instances like “&lt;Vortigaunt: Death&gt;”, “&lt;Vortigaunt: Attack&gt;”, or things like that. So, for me there is no point to modify all those instances just because they are not referred by their name in the HL1 arc (and I don’t remember any of them being called as “Alien Slaves” in any point of HL1 either).</p>

<p>Wow, thank you so very much. That’s very kind of you. Do you guys have a website?</p>
<p>If I install v1.00f, it will overwrite my existing corrected closecaption_english.txt file, based on my changes, right? That means I would lose all my corrections.</p>
<p>If so, I’d rather wait until you amalgamate my file with v1.00f. Any idea when that might be done?</p>

            <p>wow, thanks a lot, some of the Translation groups have already mentioned and worked on this, but I think nobody has gone through all the missing captions, that will make the Translation process for the missing lines a lot easier! (well, most are already done, but who knows, maybe the devs may add/alter a little with the steam release, we haven’t the updated closed caps, so going on translating makes no sense right now…)</p>

        <title>Updated Closed Captions Mod Release</title>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m taking the plunge and giving something to the BM community, from which I’ve taken so much from.</p>
<p>I’ve initiated a project that focuses on finding and correcting the numerous dialog/subtitle caption errors that presently exist in BM. There are dozens of instances where the dialog that is spoken by the character in audio form is not accurately reflected in the subtitle caption that is displayed at the bottom of the screen in written form. Hopefully, this mod will deepen, however slightly, the immersion factor in BM.</p>
<p>More importantly, this project is especially beneficial to those individuals that are hearing impaired. In some circumstances, subtiltles are the only means by which they can understand what’s transpiring in the game, assists them in determining the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to progress the game further, and helps them in more fully understanding and appreciating the gameplay and storyline.</p>
<p>I’m just doing my little part in honing, polishing and improving BM to be as bug-free as it can possibly be. It’s a very painstaking process, but one that I feel needs to be done.</p>
<p>There is a detailed “ReadMe” in the zip file. Please thoroughly read it.</p>
<p>I’ll endeavor to keep searching for additional errors and correct them as they are discovered, but this is a daunting task. After installing this mod, if you discover any additional errors, please report them here in this BM forum. Please provide me with as much info as possible so that I can easily zero in on the corrections that need to be applied. Typically, I require the game level/chapter, the character speaking (Barney, scientist, other) and as much of the spoken audio dialog as you can take note of. Once a sufficient number of new corrections are made, I’ll release an updated version of the mod.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your invaluable contributions to this project.</p>
<p>Happy gaming everyone!<br>
Dadster</p>
<p>Ps: A special shout out and thanks to forum contributor [COLOR=‘Lime’]kyyrma, who helped with some questions I had concerning some of the mechanics involved.<br>
