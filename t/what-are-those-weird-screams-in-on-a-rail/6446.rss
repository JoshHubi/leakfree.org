    <description>I saw that Freeman&#39;s Mind episode, and I have finished the game.

He thinks &quot;that&#39;s either a really exotic bird, or the souls of the damned begging to be released from the neverending agony&quot; or some shit like that.

            <p>In on a rail, near the bottom of the rocket there is a loud scream. First time i played HL it scared the shit out of me and after looking in the room with tons of gibs, i ran back to the tram and drove as fast as possible away from this place.</p>
<p>I never went to this place again.</p>
<p>First i thought  it’s just the scream of the soldiers who died there. But after thinking about that this sounds are also on XEN i don’t know anymore. In my opinion, they are the remaining sounds of an cut Story. Maybe they wanted to add an beta monster in this chapter, but they cut it out. So they left the sounds there because of the atmosphere.</p>
