    <title>trouble with Windows 7 setup...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/trouble-with-windows-7-setup/5737</link>
    <description>ok so now I wanted to upgrade to windows 7 64 bit version, and am currently using windows XP 32 bit version. now my problem is when I hit the install Button the windows setup load files and then it gives me this error :
[quote]
windows could not retrieve information about the disks on this computer.
[/quote]
I googled and I didn&#39;t find a good solution =/, there&#39;s one thing though, one of the solutions mentioned running &quot;SERVICES.MSC&quot; and set the &quot;Virtual drive&quot; to automatic, and the problem is I looked for this VD and didn&#39;t find it on the list.

help would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>Rather than customize my windows installation I first install the untouched windows, make all the necessary software/driver installations and other changes I need, and then save the disc image and back it up on my removeable hard drive.</p>

            <p>I prefer to rip the windows 7 install myself so I can add custom drivers, remove microsoft built in graphics drivers, add a valid CD key, all the updates, custom uxtheme patch built in with a few skins and all the useless services like action center and indexing disabled out of the box.</p>

<p>you need a disc either way unless you’re installing from a network, the point i was trying to make was that he should have the disc and not have to burn an ISO if its legal</p>

            <p>the only scenario where dragging files out of the iso would be recommendable is when you’re installing 7 on a PC with no CD drive (copying the files onto a bootable flash drive)</p>
<p>otherwise always burn using the original iso</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s why it won’t work… You have to copy the disk image entirely. What makes the CD bootable isn’t a file, so if you copy files with a drag-and-drop (or equivalent), it won’t work.<br>
If you download the disc from a torrent or something, it should be a .iso, or some other disk image format. If you have an original DVD to copy from, you have to make a disc copy, and not copy the files themselves.</p>
<p>With PowerISO I think you can tell it to make the DVD bootable as well… If you don’t have any disk image source with you anymore.<br>
You can probably Burn a disk image with PowerISO as well… never used that program much though.</p>

</aside>
<p>Come again? Do you mean you extracted the files from the .iso and then burnt those instead?!<br>
If that’s the case then your disc will never boot since those information are not stored as usual files on the media.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imgburn.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ImgBurn</a> is very handy, choose ‘Write Image File to Disc’ option then select the .iso file and you should be all set.</p>

Yeah… you ‘have’ to be able to boot from the cd.</p>
<p>After you selected boot CD Rom, did you hit Enter repeatedly?</p>
<p>Is it a retail dvd, or did you burn it? It has to be burned correctly to be bootable.</p>

<p>Define something then (what did you try?)</p>
<p>There should be a boot menu key. Try holding F8 when the computer boots up (On one of my PCs it’s F11 so try that aswell) and you should be greeted with a nice boot list where you can select the device to boot.</p>

Dude, Windows 7’s installation disk gives you a nice GUI to do all the formatting crap, no need for that ugly command line</p>

<p>Oh, I know that. But I must have misunderstood shadi’s post then since I assumed he was getting that error message once he pressed the “Install” button on the Win7 Install disc. Sorry for my confusion.</p>

<p>Edit:<br>
(to Shadi)<br>
Your DVD drive should show up as ‘IDE device’ or something in the list… if it doesn’t, maybe it automatically tries to boot from the dvd if there’s something in it, or there might be another option to boot from it.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you notice the screen going black while you boot, try hitting Enter a couple of times.</p>
