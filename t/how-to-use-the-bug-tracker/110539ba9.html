<p>So much for your concerns about not being rude. Any particular reason why you’re singling out and ripping me apart, in a post originally submitted by TurboTsunami, concerning revamping/updating/redesigning the bug-tracker?</p>

<p>Respectfully, I take issue with your comment that “Everyone else has been reporting awesome issues that are definitely problems. Dadster’s reports on the other hand, consist of objects being off by three units, or safety problems such as switches being too close to a ledge”. These two examples are by far, far in the minority and were put forth more as proposals, rather than bug-fixes.</p>

<p>Doing a cursory search for ‘clip into’ on the bug tracker yields <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bmscd/black-mesa-source/issue/728/electrical-cables-clip-into-face-of-data" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">24 results</a>. Go do a search for all of your bugs. A huge portion of them are minor issues that aren’t reasonable to fix.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, I’d like to think that I’ve also “reported awesome issues that are definitely problems”, just like the rest of the community, as is evidenced by the fact that dozens of bugs-issues that I have reported were actually accepted and have been “RESOLVED” by your team. Let’s not lose sight of this fact, and make it appear or suggest that ALL of my bug submissions are nonsensical. That would be an inaccurate statement or conclusion on your part.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Out of the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bmscd/black-mesa-source/issues?reported_by=~BM-Eye" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">263</a> bugs you have reported:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/bmscd/black-mesa-source/issues?reported_by=~BM-Eye&amp;status=resolved" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">47</a> were marked RESOLVED.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/bmscd/black-mesa-source/issues?reported_by=~BM-Eye&amp;status=wontfix" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">185</a> are marked WONTFIX, virtually all of which are minor visual problems.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/bmscd/black-mesa-source/issues?reported_by=~BM-Eye&amp;status=new" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">9</a> are marked as new.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/bmscd/black-mesa-source/issues?reported_by=~BM-Eye&amp;status=duplicate" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">11</a> are duplicates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: None of those 263 issues are gameplay or crash issues.</p>
<p>As you can see, the RESOLVED vs WONTFIX count is vastly different. Why are 185 of your issues marked WONTFIX? We clearly marked issues we fixed with RESOLVED. The only conclusion left is that 185 of your bug reports are things we don’t feel we want to / can fix. We triaged every single one of your 263 bug reports. That takes a lot of time which was my gripe in the original post I made to which TurboTsunami replied (Well make a new bug tracker, duh!).  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>There is a reason why both TexFAMGUY1 and I reacted the same way to your reports Dadster. Both he, myself, and even stormseeker to an extent spent a time attempting to tell you why we’re ignoring visual issues.</p>

<p>I think I should be afforded some amount of appreciation and/or credit, and not made out to be the bad guy, in my efforts to improve BMS.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not trying to make you out to be the bad guy. I griped about the bug tracker and you happened to be the reason why. No harm no foul.</p>
<p>I guess the final word on the tracker is, we are working through bug tracker issues at a steady pace. If we deem that its necessary to install a new tracker, we’ll let everyone know. Right now, it is easier (and cheaper) to use a free service like bitbucket.</p>

<p>You know what, I’m sorry; I should’ve worded my post differently. It was not a matter of singling you out, you just happened to be the only case in which a user had submitted 200+ bugs. You’re right, stormseeker did state “continue posting these bugs.” I’ll be honest with you though, I doubt we’ll have time to be fixing them (they’re extremely minor issues). My guess is he said this not to hurt your fragile feelings. I’m more of a fan of being direct. You’re a useful bug reporter and community member, but I think your efforts would be put to better use reporting <span class="bbcode-b">gameplay</span> bugs. If you still have questions on what that means, send me a private message.</p>

<p>I’ve sent you MULTIPLE private messages asking both nicely and bluntly to refrain from posting bugs that are related to clipping. I’ve made two MASSIVE posts about what we’d love to see (which you completely ignored). I have not had to do this for anyone else using our tracker. <span class="bbcode-b">Just you</span>.</p>
<p>I shut the tracker down (for everyone, not just you) because we had to triage the ton of bug reports you made. Your metric fuckton of bug reports crowds out everyone elses, which means more time spent WONTFIX’ing your stuff rather than actually resolving some crash reports.</p>

          <p>Let me reply to some of the comments posted by your-name-here, in post <span class="hashtag">#49</span>, and JamesKane , in post <span class="hashtag">#50</span>, both situated on page 3 (which is partially clipping into page 4).</p>
<p>I’m not going to adopt an adversarial stance, concerning this discussion, as I think the two of you have.</p>
<p>In response to this excerpt from your-name-here, “185 of your bugs will not be fixed unless BMS is completely polished”. Contrary to other comments made by you and other BM Devs, are you stating that BMS will never be completely polished or polished to some noticeable visually improved state, that incorporates fixes pertaining to the bug reports that you have/will receive? That’s interesting.</p>
<p>In contrast to your observations, although I did use noclip early on in searching for bugs, as I’ve repeatedly stated recently, I’ve refrained from doing so, at your request, for sometime now. I’m using normal player movement and suit zoom to search out bugs. You keep overlooking this point.</p>
<p>You keep bringing up and hanging on to my now famous “a switch being in an unsafe place” issue. That was reported almost two months ago, early on in my bug reporting. At the time, I accepted your feedback, hence the reason why I haven’t reported anything similar since.</p>
<p>You keep stating that my bugs reports are taxing and causing you a serious loss of resources. That really is a load of bullcrap. My bug reports are detailed with carefully crafted screenshots, in order to assist you in easily comprehending and determining the nature of the bug. For the most part, no sooner had I submitted my bug report, your team almost immediately categorized it as WONTFIX, which was evident when I refreshed the bug-reporter page, after the submission of each bug report. You could not have gone into the game editor, or whatever you use to confirm the bug issue reported. As quickly as I was submitting them, you were identifying them as WONTFIX. This was happening right before my eyes, in real time, with minimal delay. Actually, it took less time for you to do this than it did for me to submit the bugs. You weren’t investing any appreciable amount of time in accomplishing this, contrary to your statements.</p>
<p>I guess this all boils down to what someone considers as game-breaking bugs. Your viewpoint is geared towards issues that crash the game or inhibit the player from progressing or using the assets that are available to him/her. On top of this, my viewpoint includes aesthetic and visual details that breaks the player’s game immersion factor, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>textures that blink in and out of view.</li>
<li>similar assets/models that display different lighting characteristics.</li>
<li>handrails with gaps.</li>
<li>handrails that don’t contact walls.</li>
<li>pipe mounting brackets not adhered to surfaces (what’s the point of your pipe assets/models having mounting brackets if they’re not attached to anything?).</li>
<li>objects clipping into/through other objects (including the player).</li>
<li>objects floating in mid air.</li>
<li>inconsistencies in object placement, either within a map or other level(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, I get your drift. I’ll endeavor to post bugs that don’t involve issues related to clipping, z-fighting or lighting issues, unless they are extreme/obvious in nature.</p>
<p>In reply to an excerpt from JamesKane, “The average player is not going to give two shits about a monitor prop floating… when he is shooting bees out of an aliens ass and having fun doing it”. I think all living species, whether human or not, expect a certain amount of decorum, decency and respect, when it comes to impacting pain onto ones private parts. Consider the discomfort if it was imparted onto you!</p>
<p>Maybe you Devs experienced this as a result of my numerous bug reports? If so, I sincerely apologize for not recognizing it sooner and causing you such discomfort, to your private parts.</p>

          <p>Well, I’d shape the guidelines slightly differently:</p>
<p>trivial - issue is hardly noticeable<br>
minor - issue is noticeable, but does not have a serious impact on gameplay<br>
major - issue prevents the player from progressing or seriously affects his/her gameplay after progressing or is very noticeable and annoying<br>
critical - issue causes the game to crash or causes serious performance problems<br>
blocker - issue prevents the game from starting at all</p>
<p>Also issue status guide:</p>
<p>INVALID - described issue does not actually exist or affects only modded or otherwise altered game<br>
WONTFIX - developers decided not to fix this issue<br>
DUPLICATE - description covers an issue that was already posted earlier<br>
ON HOLD - issue is confirmed to exist, but it will not be fixed until additional information is provided<br>
RESOLVED - issue has been fixed<br>
OPEN - issue has been confirmed to exist and is awaiting an examination</p>
