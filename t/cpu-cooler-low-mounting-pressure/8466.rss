    <title>CPU Cooler low mounting pressure</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cpu-cooler-low-mounting-pressure/8466</link>
    <description>Hi

I just installed my new cooler (thermaltake SpinQ Vt cooling a phenom II 1090t) and i noticed the mounting pressure is really low. (so low i can still move it after install)

The temperatures are lower than stock cooler though... only i think they should be even lower.

idle temp is around 34°C and after an hour of prime 95 i hit a max of 57°C

are these temps normal for this cooler? and should i be worried about the mounting pressure?</description>

            <p>Yes on all 3 things… I even checked the instructions over and over just to see if i missed something.</p>
<p>But it’s ok. I’ll see if i can fix it some other way. for now the temperatures are fine and I can always fit the stock cooler again.</p>

            <ol>
<li>Did you use the proper AMD clip that was included with the cooler ?</li>
</ol>
<p>2  Did you first align and secure the first side of the clip (the  side  without  lever) onto the retention  frame’s  tabs?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Did you align  the  other  side  of  the  clip  onto the  retention  frame’s  tap,  and  then  turn clockwise  until  the  clip  is  secured  tightly onto  the  taps?</li>
</ol>

            <p>Thanks for the replies</p>
<p>I’ve re seated the cooler. I don’t know what it was. but the temps have gone down a bit more to what i was expecting (max 52°C after an hour of prime95). I can still move it a bit though. there’s just no way to get enough pressure.</p>
<p>So i guess I’m fine with the temps now. but i can’t say i’ll recommend this cooler to anyone else.</p>

            <p>I’m reading 36 idle. With stock cooler on a 1100T. Haven’t checked under load though, but it seems that you being able to move the cooler has some effect on the temps… I would fix that ASAP. Allthough 34/57 isn’t bad at all but you might be able to squeeze a bit more out of the cooler</p>

            <p>Those temps are great for an AMD 6x CPU.</p>

            <p>temps seem fine, but the cooler really shouldn’t move. Did you check the clasps?</p>
