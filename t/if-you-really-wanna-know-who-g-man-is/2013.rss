    <description>Read that interview with Doug Lombardi from Valve.
*Spoilers ahead*
[url]https://computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=198032[/url]
For the lazy people to click:
Q: So is it all coming to a huge end after Episode III?
Doug Lombardi: We&#39;re gonna wrap it all up, put a bow on it - the G-Man is Gordon&#39;s father... it&#39;s all good.</description>

            <p>I’m sure that the Gman is there for the sake of mystery. He doesn’t really drive the plot or anything, especially not in HL1 and HL2. Maybe a bit more in the episodes. But I think Valve often goes like “Hmm… what should we do with the Gman now? Oh let’s make him say this and that, so we could link this story with that one!”. I don’t think the Gman had some specific role since the beginning, but Valve is rather making it up as they go, just like the rest of the story. I’m sure EP3 will bring some more interesting info about him, since EP3 is necessarily the last Half-Life release in a long time, and the Gman had an increasingly important presence.</p>
<p>In HL1, he just stared at you all along, and then had a closing speech which brought the game to an end in a nice and satisfactory way. In HL2 it’s the same thing, while in EP1 for the first time you see him opposing you as the Vortiguants pull you out of his control. In EP2 he expresses his frustration and reveals some more info, also, it’s the first time he talks to you mid-game. In EP3, I guess we’ll know more about what Eli and the Gman had in common, since Eli also knows him. I’m sure there will be some sort of closing event that will reveal something interesting, then raise a lot of suspense that may be used in HL3 one day.</p>
<p>I don’t know whether the Gman being Gordon’s father would be interesting in any way, but I think it wouldn’t make sense. He would not have wanted to kill you in HL1 (when you don’t go into his portal) and he would not act the way he does. I think his sole role is to be mysterious, and to keep us asking questions.</p>

 Grey Acumen:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Breen’s Host body is Gordon Freeman from the future. This gave him a number of odd mannerisms as well as a making a number of changes to the body itself. The result was his ability to move differently through time, and once he recognized who he was, he set about going back in time to set the series of events in motion that would lead to acquiring his host body and awesome powers. Of course he needed to ensure that Gordon Freeman survived or else he’d never be able to get his host body, which is why you constantly see him throughout HL and HL2.<br>
As for that scene at the end of Half Life, he actually made multiple runs through that, going back in time repeatedly and giving advice to himself until he managed to make the offer in such a way that gordon would accept it. There were multiple cases where Gordon refused, but Gman would just go back in time to alter his speech/inflection slightly until he got the answer he wanted.</p>
<p>So Gman is actually Breen’s Mind + Gordon’s Body + Combine Powers</p>

<p>Considering that unless one of us works at Valve (and even then…) this is all pure conjecture anyway, “I favour the possibility” is more or less implied. Specifically stating that you’re not sure is redundant. The only post really excluded is the OP, but he can be forgiven for reasons of being dense in the ways of humor (and he clearly DID think he found the truth, so he wouldn’t have used “I think” anyway since he thought he had definitive proof).</p>

            <p>I’ve always wondered who the G-Man was really referring to when he says about Xen:<br>
“The Borderworld is now under <span class="bbcode-b">our</span> control”<br>
Perhaps deceptively making you think he means “humans” or ‘Earths’, though I doubt it.</p>
<p>There’s so many poorly disguised guesses in this thread that start with “G-Man is” when it’s obvious the authior does not know for certain.<br>
Personally, I favour the possibility that G-Man might be Cave Johnson, who didn’t actually die, due to an incarnation of GlaDOS haing an electronic backup on record.</p>

<p>Illusion, “astral projection” of some sort via the vortessence (since he has hammerspace Gordon-storage capabilities this doesn’t invalidate any physical interaction or delivery he may have done), perhaps the combine even engineered a body for him so he could infiltrate Earth. I’m pretty sure the Combine have body-swapping abilities, didn’t Breen talk about wanting a host body before he went to the Combine homeworld? Or am I mixing up canon and Raising the Bar again?</p>

<p>Alright, since I’m bored, how about this:</p>
<p>G-man is a Vort, more specifically, he’s the Vort’s Breen (meaning, he sold the Voritgaunts out to the Combine, which eventually lead to a retreat to Xen). That would explain why he seems to access the same pocket dimension as the Vortigaunts, as well as why multiple Vortigaunts can override the will of someone who appeared to be almost godlike by that point in the story. The G-Man’s current dealings are either him feeling remorse and legitimately trying to help his people (essentially following the Combine’s laws, orders, and restrictions to the letter while doing the opposite of what they want) and the Vorts just don’t trust him. Or, he really was working against the resistance the whole time, and the entire reason for the Black Mesa incident was to flush the Vortigaunts out of hiding and make up for his failure as administrator, getting humanity too was just a bonus.</p>

</aside>
<p>The other Vorts have been living among humans for 10-20 years now, G-man has been popping in and out and doing who knows what, almost certainly not dealing exclusively with the planet Earth or its native inhabitants. Not to mention that even regular Vorts aren’t perfect. The have a tendency to put sentences in Subject Object Verb form on the odd occasion, as well as use definite articles in front of names (the Alyx Vance, the Freeman etc). They also place some strange tonal shifts on some syllables. G-man doesn’t have the same issues, which is a weakness, but the Vorts are by no means perfect English speakers.</p>
