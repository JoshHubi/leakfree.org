    <title>Natural Selection 2 (and apparantly... Overgrowth?)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/natural-selection-2-and-apparantly-overgrowth/2507</link>
    <description>Who here played the Natural Selection mod for HL?  I remember when I played it, it was during a lull in server action, and then I got a new computer and never got a chance to play it again.  What I do remember was that it was pretty damn fun, and that I kept getting eaten.  My friend was grossed out by the stomach texture, heh.

Then, a few weeks ago, I found out about overgrowth, in an unimportant way, and followed it.  Hey, I had no idea WHAT THE HELL it was, but there was a video with ninja bunny ragdolls being thrown around.  Strange?  Yes.  Kinda cool, yeah.  Creepy, a bit.  It wasn&#39;t till after that that I found out that they were also working on a commercial project, Natural Selection 2.  It was like, out of the blue, &quot;Hey, look!  Natural Selection 2!&quot;  And I was like &quot;WHAAAT?&quot;  And hey, they made it to the ModDB Top 100.

I remember Natural Selection being a great game, so is there any way that a full-blown indie GAME couldn&#39;t be just as good?  I doubt it.

I know that I&#39;mma vote for it, and then prolly buy it, WHO&#39;S WITH ME!

            <p>Yeah, the kung fu rabbits weren’t the… not-strange-est thing, but watching them get thrown around was entertaining, and helped me find NS2.</p>

            <p>I’m going to buy NS2 when it has a release date. No interest in kung fu rabbits, though.</p>
