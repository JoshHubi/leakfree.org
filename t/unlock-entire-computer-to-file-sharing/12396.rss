    <title>Unlock entire computer to file sharing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unlock-entire-computer-to-file-sharing/12396</link>
    <description>I&#39;m on a home network with people I trust. I do not give a shit about security. So, my question is, how do I ENTIRELY open up all of my HDD to read/write over my home network? I&#39;ve tried this in the past and have been able to free up most of everything except for program files. It&#39;d make things much more convenient for file sharing if I could read/write to and from my program files folder.</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/sersoft">@sersoft</a> : use utorrent to be sure the transfer is well made ;’]<br>
i do it all time , windows or linux do NOT have the checking of torrent files .<br>
speed is quite fast , that is sad the utoorent or others are all time sending files in “out of orders” packets… while it could behave live windows-ftp… files sending : from the begining to the end and make hard drive very happy :retard:</p>

            <p>windows file sharing is a pain in the ass, especially since they decided to change the meaning of the word homegroup, sometimes I say <span class="bbcode-i">fuck it</span> and simply use VNC or other software to transfer files on my network</p>

            <p>I’ve been out of town so I haven’t had much of a chance to fiddle around, however in the past when I simply shared C as if it were any ordinary folder it still won’t let me access it. Same with program files. Presumable because M$ thinks we’re too stupid to let us make our own security decisions. When I get back I’ll take a look at it again.</p>

            <p>\computername should work too, and it should show up in the Network panel on W7</p>
<p>But yeah, you should be able to just share C: the same way as any other folder, and should be accessible through the homegroup if all the computers run W7.</p>
<p>Sharing between W7 and XP is a pain in the ass in my experience, every time I’ve set it up, it wasn’t working anymore by the next time I tried to access shared folders.</p>

            <p>right click on folder -&gt; share with -&gt; specific people -&gt; in the drop down menu select “Everyone”</p>
<p>you must know your IP address because on the other computer you need to open explorer and type \192.168.2.117 (example) to access your files</p>
<p>if you really don’t care about security and need to access the files on a WinXP or Android device, you need to disable “windows 7 homegroup”, 128bit encryption and password protected sharing (just press start and type sharing settings on Win7)</p>
