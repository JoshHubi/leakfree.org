    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-didnt-send-that-email/4594</link>
    <description>Ok, so I get an email from my sister a few minutes ago replying to an email that I never sent her.  How do I look up where this email came from?

Here is the email:

            <p>I will note this has happened at my school as a practical joke before. (I’ll paraphrase, this is from memory)</p>
<p>(first message was something from the professor to a student indicating about academic dishonesty/bad group work etc)</p>
<p>Prof,<br>
I’m sorry if this innocence is sounding faked, but I honestly don’t know what you were talking about. I have contributed everything I can to the group project, and have been sure to use authentic sources. Could I please meet at your office to discuss this? I really can’t take an F on this assignment!</p>
<p>RE:<br>
I’m sorry, but I don’t know which E-mail you’re referring to.</p>
<p>(turned out one of the classmates had played a prank, and spoofed the from and reply-to part of the header. This is technically academic dishonesty in itself, so he was owed a favor to not say anything)</p>

            <p>too long; didn’t read</p>
<p>You’d need the header of the message that SHE received. We could get the ip in there, but that header right there just tells us where her reply went through, so it’s not much help.<br>
But first thing to do (if not already done) would be to change your password… chances are some chinese bot hacked in your account or something. It happened to me with my hotmail account: every single contact of me received a message about some bullshit, and I asked one of them to give me the header, and it traced to China… I hate China.</p>

            <p>First, check your “sent items” list and see if it really came from in your account. Second, have your sister give you the header info from the email she received. The header info you put up looks like it was from an email sent to you…   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>To me it seems like an automated email… but from where did it come from ? What program could possibly send an email from my gmail account?</p>

<p>It is probably a fake addresser. All someone would need is the email address of you and your sister.</p>

            <p>Have you just made yours and your sister’s e-mail adress public in a gamer forum full of (allegedly - check the personality disorder thread) psychopaths? Or is that address a placeholer?</p>
<p>To me, this e-mail looks either automated or written by someone who was on drugs. How’s your 23year old son doin, by the way? Didn’t he have this little issue with getting high at other people’s places, causing you massively embarrassing parenting advices from other parents?</p>
