    <description>I&#39;ve decided to try and collect old Half-Life stuff that many&#39;s forgotten about, or never even heard of.

So far I&#39;ve found these:[/SIZE]
Half-Life: Further Data[/SIZE]
Contains player models, sprays and maps that have not been included in the steam release.

Half-Life: Day One[/SIZE]
Demo. Contains the first part of the game, (that is maps, sprites, models etc.) Although it&#39;s pretty much the same, there are quite a few differences.

Half-Life: Uplink[/SIZE]
Demo. Singleplayer maps based on a cut part of the game.

Half-Life Preliminary Findings[/SIZE]
Gameplay footage and interviews.

Intro Map[/SIZE]
Old intro map starring Mr. Valve, their mascot.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;m working on:[/SIZE]
Half-Life SDK[/SIZE]
Exactly what it says on the tin. Contains decompiled models of stuff already in the game (might contain secrets, like unused animations and so forth), but also the charger and panthereye. I&#39;ve tried to compile them myself, but there seems to be something missing on some of them. I&#39;d like some help, because I believe this could be very interesting. For instance, the SDK contains a neat HD texture for the battery.

Half-Life for the Dreamcast[/SIZE]
Half-Life was supposed to be ported to the Dreamcast by Gearbox, the same people responsible for porting it to the Playstation. However, it was never released. The sounds are WAV, but unplayable by WAV players. The models use pvr textures instead of bmp textures and are all screwed up. It would be great if someone knew how to convert them.
[url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=9300&#39;]Download[/url]

Half-Life for the Playstation 2[/SIZE]
I&#39;ve never been a console guy, so I missed out on this one. It&#39;s not as easy as simply getting it, though. The maps are in BS2 format instead of BSP, the models are DOLs instead of MDLs and the sprites are SPZ instead of SPR. DOLs can be opened and converted with Jed&#39;s Half-Life Model Viewer, but the rest I don&#39;t know what to do about.

Feel free to come with suggestions, help and other feedback.</description>

Half-Life was supposed to be ported to the Dreamcast by Gearbox, the same people responsible for porting it to the Playstation. However, it was never released. Somehow, Youtube user MarphitimusBlackimus has tracked down the game and released a few videos on the subject. I’ll try and get in contact with him.</p>
