    <title>end of &quot;We&#39;ve Got Hostiles&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/end-of-weve-got-hostiles/10683</link>
    <description>I have a pretty tame laptop, AMD turion 64x2 with a poopy radeon card. Occasional freezing resolves itself pretty quick.

Problem: the first bit on surface. The big hangar with the light shafts shining down and all the outside fight until you are back down heading to blast pit.
Playable, but pretty big slowdown even with settings turned really low. Section could use some optimization if that&#39;s possible.

But mostly BM works great, and is a blast. So far &quot;mod&quot; is amazing.</description>

<p>Yes and yes. BM is not that well optimized compared to games released by Valve. It is a known fact and we all hope devs would address this issue somehow. Then again, having a better rig helps to mitigate the problem: there are reports from people using 2xSLI 560 Ti setups having no problems with BM performance whatsoever. Thus it’s just a matter of a year or two till this problem would be “auto-fixed” by the progress in the GPU world :-).</p>

            <p>…so it means nothing in reality. As a software developer I could assure you that there are a lot of ways to bring ANY system down to it knees no matter how powerful it is. Source engine could to it as well. BM is a different game, don’t expect it to be same level fast as other Source-based games out in the wild.</p>

<p>Man this is source enigne you dont need high end pc , i have dual core,2 gb ram and i play left for dead 2 and half life 2 all on high with 4x aa and 1280x1024 resolution and no slowdowns,and devs posted ideal system requirements whitch are not high end pc so…</p>

</aside>
<p>The trouble is that the game’s load is not evenly spread. I have a system that can run this game at max settings at 1920x1080 with no problems most of the time… Except when I zoom in with the crossbow and end up with a picture-in-picture situation that causes the world to be rendered twice. Then it lags, making precise crossbow shots problematic. Or when I reach the end of Surface Tension and I go up to the artillery console that’s also picture-in-picture, and that messes up my framerate something fierce.</p>
<p>So do I lower settings to make those situations playable but make the rest of the game ugly, or do I keep settings high so most of the game is fun but I grit my teeth at those instances? Lose/lose. I’d kill for an option to disable PiP effects and have the old airstrike targeting rig back.</p>

            <p>Main slowdown causes in that area:<br>
a) dynamic lights from a lot of marines shooting at you (could be remedied by temporarily disabling dynamic lighting - see <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Question 9 here</a>);<br>
b) shadows-related calculations eat a lot there - you could try lowering your shadows quality to “Low”;<br>
c) a lot of prop_static entities with pretty complicated geometry - no way to workaround except for upgrading CPU and GPU;</p>
