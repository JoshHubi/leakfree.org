in ep 1 we are in the last wagon,with citadel in front of us and when we are about to escape the damn wave of some portal shit we get hit by it. in ep 2 we begin in (still last?) wagon and see that citadel is behind us instead of front? so what the hell?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <ol>
<li>Originally, Episode 2 was supposed to start with a series of ledge-to-ledge jumps (similar to the path from the Lighthouse to the Sandtraps’ desert in HL2), but after seeing many playtesters falling to their deaths repeatedly in the first 5 minutes of the game and being frustrated, they decided to exchange ACTUAL danger with PERCEIVED danger (moving through the slowly sinking train seems dangerous, but is actually totally safe).</li>
</ol>
<p>That caused them to have to find a different way for Alyx to get hurt, because they now couldn’t use her fall; besides, as Valve said, it seemed arbitrary that the cat-like Alyx, being all dexterous and able to jump and climb with ease through dangerous ledges and stuff, would suddenly make such a silly thing as to fall down a cliff.</p>
<p>Also, by making Alyx hurt by the Hunter, they could then introduce a much stronger emotions, as can be seen at the Radio station (after you clear the mines and get the car) – you can see Alyx “pumping up her rage” when the Hunters attack you in the building with broken roof: “They got me before, but not this time. NOT THIS TIME!” (paraphrased)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Portal Storms. The explosion of the Citadel which knocked you unconscious also reintroduced portal storms into the world. So whoever is wondering how did Gordon get inside the train just has to suspend his disbelief a bit and say “Oh, there was a portal storm and gordon was shifted by few feet inside the train wagon”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, Alyx couldn’t have moved Gordon inside the train, because once you reunite, she exclaims: “Gordon! There you are!” and later: “When I couldn’t find you, I got worried…”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, it could just as well be the work of Vortigaunts, similarly to what they did at the beginning of Episode 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gordon only sees everything WHEN HE IS CONSCIOUS! We’ve seen him moved when he was knocked out in Half-Life 1, we saw him moved in Half-Life 2, we saw him moved at the beginning of Episode 1, and it’s absolutely OK that Vortigaunts might have moved the train, the wagon and/or Gordon while he was unconscious.<br>
BTW, think about what it must have been for Alyx in Ep2 – one moment, she’s punched in the back by the hunter, then stabbed to death. She passes out. And when she wakes up, she has 4 drooling Vortigaunts leaning over her, she’s underground on a concrete slab and she has no idea what was happening with her.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, in essence, while Valve did build a nice vista and didn’t care (at the beginning) about how to connect it to the end of Episode 1, it is not continuity-breaking enough to justify the amount of “bitching” some of you show here.</p>

            <p>Obviously the explosive force knocked you unconscious as the train continued to work its way several hundred feet up a mountain, around a corner, coming to a delicate stop at a collapsed bridge.  At this point, Alyx went flying off into the woods from the force of the stop and Gordon glitched through a wall.  Duh.</p>

            <p>We already know that we get to see everything Gordon does. There’s no opportunity for an intermediate event. Plus, it’s probably something that someone at Valve did sort of notice, but the others decided the view was better this way so they left it.</p>

            <p>Gordon gets knocked unconscious by a blast of the portal storm, the train continues along the tracks for a while and turns a corner, joining another track and comes to a stop when it derails from the bridge. Might not be pretty, but it works. I never thought it was particularly immersion-breaking or strange when I played it.</p>
<p>As for his position in the train… I dunno. Alyx said she heard vortigaunts, so I assumed they did something mysterious and vortigauntesque to save Gordon from dying in the train wreck then put him back where he’d be safe but close enough to where he had been so he might not notice they’d interfered and put it down to being confused 'cos he’d been knocked out.</p>

<p>The red line is the path the train took out of City 17, at least IMHO.</p>

            <p>Not to mention that the shock wave is not the same as the white light.  You will be blinded, wonder wtf was that, then be knocked on your ass.</p>

            <p>alright. first off, theres a turn right after the tunnel at like 30 seconds, there is a second turn right before the first pulse wave hits the train. second, you can’t tell if it’s turning or not at the end because the wave of energy pretty much blocks everything else out. Second, there is some time between when EP1 ends and EP2 begins. that would be the time between when the wave hit, and when you woke up from blacking out we don’t know how long that was, and we don’t know the events that happened with that. for all we know, Alyx became conscious long before gordon did while the train was still going and dragged him inside so nothing more would happen to him. It wouldn’t be the first time Alyx came back to her conscious state long before we did mind you (remember the beginning of episode 1). the train could have rolled off the tracks after you were dragged inside the cart. the vortigaunts could have put you in a different car to protect you from dying, hell the G-man could have put you in a different cart to keep you from dying, since they both see you as an invaluable tool and neither want you dead. the explosion could have propelled you back into the car (under the assumption that you were standing directly in front of the door) before tossing the train off the tracks. bear in mind that when we wake up the train is a MUCH further away from the citadel than when the wave hit and we somehow ended up on top of a cliff. The railings also as someone already said, run parallel to the city from where you start off. they’re on a bridge over your head. the following are some pictures i just quickly snapped</p>
<p>this is the end of the map in EP1 where the explosion hits note the distance from the citadel, you’re still pretty damn close.</p>
<p><a href="https://img251.imageshack.us/i/ep1c17060001.jpg/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></a></p>
<p>this is where you start in EP2 again note the distance, you’re pretty damn far away now.</p>
<p><a href="https://img692.imageshack.us/i/ep2outland010004.jpg/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></a></p>
<p>meaning you either got blown off the tracks and flailed into the distance (not likely because you fell through the tracks most likely because they’re old and have not been used in years and they just got hit with a shock wave at the end of ep1 that probably caused a great deal of structural damage. or you blacked out and the train kept going until it hit this failing segment of the train tracks, again i would like to reiterate that we have no clue how long we were out. Sorry for the long post.</p>

<p>That valve was so intent on creating an awesome cinematic vista at the beginning of ep2, they didn’t tie it with the end of ep1.<br>
Also, that I (and many other HL fans) never noticed this until someone pointed it out.</p>

<p>Nope.Still not funny.</p>

<p>Honestly, this makes the most sense. Think about it, the gman moved you from hl1 to hl2, he moved you from the citadel explosion in hl2 to ep1</p>

<p>no he didn’t, he moved you AWAY from the explosion at the end of HL2, but the Vortigaunts moved you to where you started in Episode 1.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>, and he most likely moved you from the second citadel explosion from ep1 to ep2. Prove me wrong. Just try, muhahahaha.</p>

</aside>
<p>Gman straight out tells you that he couldn’t do anything to influence your progress, not even just to talk to you, until the Vortigaunts were busy healing Alyx. This is also what I feel the reason is for Gman to say that he “chose” Alyx from Black Mesa when she was still a child, even though at the end of HL2 he seems to have just left her for dead. She was meant to be a trump card to distract the vortigaunts while he tried to lock you back in storage at hte end of HL2, but it ended up not being enough, but she was still useful later on, at least enough to get in touch with you during the whole Vortesence scene.</p>

<p>the surprise attack from the hunter made for a much more “Holy fucking shit” moment than a cliched “cliff-hanger.” I was stuck with my jaw agape for about a minute after that thing brutalized alyx.</p>
<p>also, the placement of the bridge and the citadel was just to present a much more epic and visually impressive vista, which made it possible to see the ruins of the citadel and the emergence of the superportal, as well as setting up a good tableau to see the effects of the portal storm. It makes sense from a story/design standpoint</p>
