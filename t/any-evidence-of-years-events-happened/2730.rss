            <p>I have always assumed that HL took place in 2006.</p>
<p>Alyx looks to be around 25/6, and we know she was a child in the Black Mesa Incident, so if she was born in 2000, she would be six during the Incidnet and if HL2 took place 20 years later, she would be 26. Great application of math isn’t it?</p>
<p>Now, the Borealis…</p>
<p>Maybe the crew saw a headcrab on the bardge and shat bricks. They tried to use their portal technology, but killed themselves in the process. The ship teleporteed deeper into the Arctic circle leaving GLaDOs in control of the ship  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Alyx also mentions that Dog was built for her when she was small, to protect her. The picture of Eli, Azian (what a creative name for an asian woman) and Alyx shows her as a small child.</p>
<p>I think she was quite young.</p>

            <p>well, what we can conclude is that Alyx was a baby when the Renascence Cascade happened in the game. so we can assume that Alyx is about 18 - 23. half-life 1 takes place in 1998 so the year could be around the years 2016 - 2019, after the Renascence Cascade<br>
when the 7 hour war happend that’s when the combine came to earth and enslaved the human race  and as well as the Vortigaunts, i would say this had been going on sense maybe the year 2000 - 2020 (about 20 years)</p>
