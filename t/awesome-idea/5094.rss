    <title>Awesome Idea?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/awesome-idea/5094</link>
    <description>I dont know how original this is but I thought this was an awesome idea! 

I was thinking about a fps/rts game with a structured command system like this:

General------Field Commander -------Infantry/support/Vehicle units

The General: The Most Important Player in the game. Builds and maintains main base. Makes base defenses and advances the weaponry of lower units.
Can Make &quot;Tactical Suggestions&quot; to field commanders . Has an High overview of battlefield. 

The Field commander: Builds and maintains forward bases. Forward base are not as productive or defend-able as the main base, but are able to stage assaults faster than the main base. Can also move to other parts of the battlefield. Decides what units to use in each of the three types of units.
Can make requests to general for additional units and and resources. Has an a low overview of his troops and forward base.

Combat units have a first-person/ third-person view

Infantry unit: Troops in a squad of 4 to 12. basic infantry to anti vehicle troops.

support unit: specialized troops ranging from medics to snipers.

Vehicle units: Vehicles ranging from APCs to tanks

Tell me what you think.

If i posted in the wrong forum its because i am a noob.:fffuuu:</description>

            <p>Team Fortress 2 was originally supposed to run on this idea, but later on it was scrapped because 90% of people who are the general would just be the general for the sake of being a general (read: suck), instead of contributing to the team.</p>
<p>Games like that won’t work on the internet just because it’s srs bsns.</p>

            <p>i was thinking about that. i would make it so you’d have to vote for the general at the beginning or have a system in which lower units could make a request and if its not denied or accepted in like 20 seconds or something like that it would be approved (ie. make a defensive structure here. request additional tanks)</p>
<p>or you could always have a vote kick or some sort of “forced Resignation” thing</p>

            <p>If the general sucks, everything goes to hell, so as such, it would be no fun to play about 90 percent of the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> it does sort of. the difference is in my idea the general and the field commanders establish your bases and defenses. they don’t just call in artillery strikes and stuff like that.</p>
