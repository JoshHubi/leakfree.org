    <title>Squad (teamwork &amp; realism based military FPS)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/squad-teamwork-realism-based-military-fps/14205</link>
    <description>Squad is a realistic open sandbox military FPS with heavy focus on teamwork and balanced realism. 
It&#39;s the spiritual successor to the hugely popular and acclaimed Battlefield 2 modification: Project Reality.

Squad will feature large scale battles with 100 players if not more, base building, huge and varied levels 
(with environments like urban, desert, forests, etc.), several infantry classes, light and heavy armored 
vehicles, aircrafts, watercrafts and multiple factions, including (if stretch goals are reached): the Russian 
and British Armed Forces.

The game is being built with the Unreal Engine 4 and is still in pre-alpha stage and therefore still has a long 
way to go. Despite of this there are already several gameplay videos out there portraying, although WIP, 
a beautiful functioning game which has already been successfully Kickstarted.

Now with almost $300.000, over 3.000 backers and a little over a week to go, we just need the help to 
reach the rest of the stretch goals  :stuck_out_tongue: 

Don&#39;t be afraid to take a quick look  :wink: [/size]
