    <title>OaR Uncut Installation</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/oar-uncut-installation/13490</link>
    <description>After updating Steam, I booted up black mesa to play a little OaR Uncut. I found to my frustration that my mods had been deleted (On A Rail Loop Mod &amp; On a Rail Uncut). I cannot seem to be able to install OaR Uncut. I have repeatedly extracted the files to my BMS folder, extracting them all at once, the whole folder a time, extracting the [b]individual files[/b] to my game, to no avail. Help?</description>
