            <p>I had a thought.  How does the cheats work for Gordon.  If he were on some serious drugs then it would make sense that he could noclip anywhere and go through walls.  He could also impulse and have all the weapons he wanted.  God for if he was tired of getting hurt.  Dang, Gordon must be on some serious drugs.</p>

<p>In HL1 the regular moving speed was 320, and you pressed walk to slow down.<br>
In HL2 the regular moving speed was 190, and you pressed sprint to get up to 320 speed, which required the suit aux power.</p>
<p>In Black Mesa, you need the suit to move at 320, but it has infinite aux power.</p>

            <p>I don’t prefer realism to fun factor. Just look at GTAIV for a prime example of that. I also know it depends on the player’s performance with the mouse, but I won’t go further than that, because it is, as you say, just a game. But that’s not the point. The point is how did you know I’m that bad with my left hand?</p>

            <p>He seems to be missing one major point. Gordon isn’t good with weapons. You are good with the mouse. You can still shoot all over the place and not hit anything. If you wan’t realism, try playing with your left hand maybe?</p>

            <p>They were trying to make the game somewhat realistic. Not when it comes to plot and enemies, but like guns not just sitting on the floor glowing like it came from heaven or enemies using realistic tactics. Not to mention that I think if you were in the same situation, you wouldn’t know how to use a gun either, unless you were in the HECU</p>
<p>And it seems a little odd to have regenerating health in CoD and MoH but it’s better than looking around for health packs constantly.</p>
<p>I understand he would be a resourceful guy, but unless he had some kind of military training no one knows about…it is possible</p>

            <p>It’s a videogame for christ’s sake. Just like <span class="bbcode-i">every</span> other shooter. In Medal of Honor you get riddled with bullets and regenerate your health constantly, while single-handedly taking on hordes of enemies, and you don’t even have a super-powered HEV suit. Because it’s a <span class="bbcode-i">videogame</span><br>
If you got shot once and died for 'realism" the game would be over pretty quickly.</p>
<p>see how this works?</p>
<p>The Hazard course is abstract, not literal. It’s only to show that he’s had the combat and hazardous environment training. That’s not the focus of the story, Gordon’s daring escape from BM is.</p>

            <p>But in other games you usually play as someone who can handle a gun. For all we know, the only gun training Gordon got was in the Hazard Course. It’s perfectly reasonable to wonder why he doesn’t shoot bullets all over the place or miss constantly when he’s a theoretical physicist and not a soldier. Should’ve been in the HECU, I tell ya…</p>

            <p>Don’t be a schmuck, Dias. I’m not joking around when I say Gordon was on drugs. Whenever he was hurt in the original game, the HEV suit would go “Blood loss, Morphine administered”, meaning that’s how he can stay alive so long. Still doesn’t explain why he’s a better shot than hundreds of heavily armed and well trained Marines. Special Forces Marines, no less.</p>
