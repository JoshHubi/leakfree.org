    <description>Hello World!

Myself (Thereabouts) and my co-host (Wowmanjacob) would like to send out a warm invite and a hearty welcome for you to come and check out our channel @ Youtube.com/thereaboutsgaming. 

We&#39;re fairly new, having started our Thereaboutsgaming channel around 8 months ago, but, since our launch in Aug 2012 we have already been keeping to our pact to release gaming videos 5 days a week (Mon-Fri).
During this time, we have been uploading numerous Black Mesa videos and would really appreciate it if you take the time to join in on our fun and check them out, heck even subscribe if you really like them! 
Like I said, we&#39;re fairly new so we haven&#39;t done quite made an extortionate amount of Black Mesa videos just yet but due to our frequent uploading quota we hope to upload a load more Black Mesa content on top of what we already have, for you to keep up to date with and (hopefully!) enjoy.
We hope you enjoy our content. Stay, enjoy &amp; relax.

If you&#39;re interested the Black Mesa playlist can be found here [url]https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxWS-MXZsl1oNzGx4so_SkUez1Ar46B3&amp;feature=view_all[/url]

Thanks,
