[b]RULES/DISCLAIMER[/b][/SIZE]

[b][u]Breaking these rules will result in infractions, bans, rejections, ejections, and if you push me too far, I&#39;ll come round to your house give you a little whack with a crowbar.[/u][/b]

Very importantly, any images which I post in this thread are ABSOLUTELY NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT. The majority of what I&#39;m going to post here are from very early development versions which were scrapped and redone, from scratch, because they were not good enough. NOTHING you see here represents how Gasworks, or Black Mesa currently looks. Do not judge the game based on what I post here. If images or topics from this thread start getting circulated, with people saying: &quot;look how awful Black Mesa MP looks!&quot; then I will stop doing these entirely. This is the top rule for these blog posts.

This is a personal dev blog, and is not sanctioned by the Black Mesa team. My views, design abilities and comments do not reflect that of the dev team.

Please stay on topic. I will happily answer questions and chat, but I won&#39;t answer questions unrelated to my current posts. I am going through the map&#39;s development chronologically. We will get to current versions, eventually.

Also, don&#39;t be mean. As the least experienced level designer on the team, I have learned incredible amounts over the course of my time here, and vastly improved my abilities. I&#39;m aiming, here, to outline the mistakes and process that led me to this stage. Comment on my mistakes and problems, and give thoughts, by all means, but if people start to be cruel or nasty, they will get infractions. We&#39;re only human.

            <p>I know that I don’t often post on the forums, but I have read all of the Gasworks topics and have found them extremely enlightening and it honestly shows your dedication.  Yes, you have had your mistakes but you have learned from them as you progress through things.  I wish I had that kind of dedication.  Honestly, sometimes being slammed with “You did this all wrong” would just kill my motivation and sometimes make me less eager to restart from scratch.  Keep up the good work!</p>

            <p>This was my favourite multiplayer map back in the day, I’m really liking the work that’s been done so far.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun with the early multiplayer of the mod and I’m very excited to see what’s coming next. Excellent work fellas.<br>

            <p>Finally had the chance to read through all these blogs.</p>
<p>I’ll just start off by saying how incredibly interesting it is to see the complete process (or at lest half of the complete process?  8|  Like seriously I’m not sure how there will be three more iterations after this). There’s a lot of stuff here that I probably hadn’t thought about during my own mapping, although I think there might have been a thing or two that I did think about without realizing it.</p>
<p>I think that the current version is gorgeous. At least, in compared to the other versions. Yeah, it’s mostly because of the new lighting on the surface and the storytelling that’s going on with the towers (which, you’re right, environmental storytelling is always awesome). With that in mind, yes I agree the lighting is too much, and you’ve said that this has since been toned down in later iterations.</p>
<p>That idea of runthroughs is also something that I always wanted to do. I’ve not yet had the chance to do something like but I can already imagine how thoroughly useful that would be.Just want to give some comments on previous blogs too since I am here.</p>
<p>I can see the whole argument about placing details behind fences. Granted the ability to interact with the environment is limited with the source engine, but placing it behind a fence is a way to have it not be a thing at all.</p>
<p>I’ve had no experience making multiplayer maps but I’ve had similar ideas regarding level of detail. For a long time I enjoyed playing TF2, which can be a very fast-paced game where a second can mean a lot. While it’s tough to say whether or not MP would be faster or slower isn’t something I can glean right now (though if HLMP is any indication it’ll be pretty fast), I would too say that it’s best to keep the player’s mind from wandering too far. Dem wall details tho.</p>
<p>Everything else was fairly informative, and overall I really enjoyed reading these blogs. I look forward to the next iteration (of both blog and map)!</p>

            <p>It is interesting to note here a problem that can pop up. If you are “waiting” for custom prop models in a level or have a bunch of them in key areas…all this iteration kills a modeler. That is unless you keep certain areas from changing. Example would be needing something custom in a certain area in version 2 (or whatever) like console shaped to a particular wall/room…then change the room to where it no longer fits. Sometimes people forget that making a killer model and texture can take 20+ hours and then it might not get used. I’m not saying it happened here but it can ;-).</p>

<p>Always an interesting read.</p>
<p>Have you bothered to compare the views compared to Uncut stuff and all ? Also be aware that other than the long-time lurkers, I can imagine that the forum hasn’t so much frequent visitors any more, so this may be a reason for the… unsatisfying response</p>

            <p>Displacements in Source are some of the most annoying work on maps I’ve ever done. They’re really tough to use effectively, but can look super nice. Can’t wait to see your final skybox!</p>
<p>It’s quite interesting to see how radical the topside changes were, everything is much brighter looking and looks very film-like, as if the MP map is being seen through a day-for-night lens. This is a very good thing, considering that you have to see what you’re shooting at.</p>

            <p>As always, loving the insight in these posts. I think it’s safe to say I’ve learned more than just one thing or two about proper MP map design, and some stuff that works for SP as well.</p>

Once again, really a nice read, Chon, especially that part of realizing that you actually are doing professional work that needs professional planning!<br>
I am particulary fond of awesome skyboxes, of which Black Mesa had quite a few! So I am really curious how this is going to turn out!

<p>Black Mesa had/has great skyboxes. They always add a lot to the surrounding environment but never detract. I think the final version of the Gasworks skybox adds to that count.</p>
<p>Thank you for the kind words. There are 3 or 4 posts left before we hit current version. I’m going to accelerate the rate of posting soon as I get 2 weeks off starting next week.</p>

            <p>I love that you included a little story with the generators and towers! Looking around at all the tiny details was one of my favorite parts of Black Mesa, and it’s so rarely done in multiplayer maps. I will have fun inspecting Gasworks inch by inch I’m sure <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
And I’m right with you on your love for skyboxes! On the few source maps I’ve made, I think I put more time into my skybox than I did the actual level! Though my displacements are far worse than yours…</p>
<p>Anyway, seeing Gasworks get closer and closer to completion is making me itch to play some deathmatch! It already looks great Text, and I can’t wait to see its final form!<br>
That conclusion sounds so ominous though… please don’t tell us you scrapped the whole thing again and started all over :fffuuu:</p>
