    <title>Games with no save option</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/games-with-no-save-option/11205</link>
    <description>The only game I&#39;ve played with no option to save whatsoever is Project IGI.
At first, this limitation does your head in, particularly if you&#39;re almost at the end of a level and you die.(only to have to reload from scratch)
But once you get used to it, it actually makes for a much more tense and tighter feel to the game.
Having said all this, I still haven&#39;t finished it lol.
Anyone know of any other titles without the save option?

            <p>Speak of the devil. The level I had just gotten up to “Get Priboi” has some of the worst respawning enemies I’ve ever seen. Honestly, once I had a grunt spawn right behind me as I left a building. So close to me that I got melee’d. The difficulty in this game just spiked-up retardedly.</p>

<p>I started playing recently (out of curiosity) &amp; I’m not having that hard a time with it. Given that I’m only about half-way into the game, the only thing that really seems to make the game hard is the severe lack of medkits. Than again, I’m mostly sniping from at least 75 meters away with the AK-47. I love how the enemies don’t react at all to other people getting killed right in front of them.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, it’s a little unforgiving in many respects, especially with medkits being so sparse. In fact some levels don’t have any.<br>
The game still gives me a kick though!</p>

            <p>There was this rail shooter on the Nintendo 64 that had no saves, titled Knife Edge: Nose Gunner. It looked cool until you started playing it. Then it was just incredibly annoying, especially with the lack of any real story or direction. Yeah, go shoot aliens while playing a light-gun shooter without a light-gun.</p>

            <p>I can’t stand FPS games that only have checkpoints, the last one I will try out is Metro 2033. Thank god I got that as a gift, it has practically everything I hate in FPS games; escort missions, no manual saving, stuck-to-a-moving-vehicle-shooting-mens section, and a race against the clock in a big ass area full of exploration potential and not a fucking clue where to go or how long until I find more filters. What a piece of shit that game is, which is really too bad as it has gorgeous atmosphere and a pretty cool story.</p>

<p>Doom64. Unless you have the memory pack that plugs into the controller.</p>

</aside>
<p>That qualification practically includes every single game that requires a memory card, therefore it doesn’t count.</p>
<p>That qualification also includes the greater majority of Nintendo 64 games which required a memory pack to save. Point negated once again.</p>
<p>I’d also like to point out that a password feature is essentially a save option in lieu of a battery save function for cartridges. So MegaMan wouldn’t be included in this as well as countless 8 and 16bit cartridges that utilized password “saves”.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m surprised no one has mentioned StarFox 64 yet. From what I’ve heard, this particular game doesn’t have an actual save function similar to the original SNES iteration.</p>

            <p>Fucking Aliens Vs Predator 1999 without patches or Gold edition.</p>
<p>God damnit I remember trying to play that as a kid, and trying to get as far as I could without any way to save my progress.</p>
<p>I would make it past the first level ok, but I would always die on the colony to the facehuggers in the med labs. Not now of course, but back then I sucked.</p>
<p>I think no saving is great for scary games, but at the same time it’s annoying when a game uses save points and you need to go somewhere/sleep.</p>

            <p>Slender: The Eight Pages has no save feature. Course, it’s only one contained level that tasks you with finding pages before you die. It definitely adds to the immersion and finality of losing your life to your pursuer.</p>
<p>As a rule, I never really cared for games that wouldn’t allow you to save, especially if there was any sort of progression. It annoyed me to no end when the earlier Sonic games forced you to start all over again when you lost all of your lives. Especially Sonic Spinball. God, that last level was a pain.</p>

            <p>There’s this obscure little rouge-like survival game called Unreal World, that autosaves your progress like minecraft, and deletes it when you die. It’s actually pretty fun.</p>

            <p>This doesn’t count but, having been playing games with auto-save features for the past ten years, I was disgruntled to find that, after playing Fallout 2 for half an hour and dying, that auto-saves just didn’t use to be a thing.</p>
<p>As for games without actual saving, I guess there were a bunch for our old Megadrive but I can’t remember what they actually were.</p>

            <p>Rocket Knight Adventures also lacked any kind of saving. (1993, Sega Genesis)<br>
Pretty hard, but playing through the stages again is always fun.</p>

            <p>Yes, it’s a PC shooter with stealth and worth the challenge.<br>
Much criticised for it’s lack of save, but you learn to live with it.</p>

            <p>Sounds like he’s referring to shooters rather than games in general, almost every console game released before 1992 lacked a save feature, if you went back in time and told the game developers about this new idea they’d call it cheating.</p>

            <p>The only game I’ve played with no option to save whatsoever is Project IGI.<br>
At first, this limitation does your head in, particularly if you’re almost at the end of a level and you die.(only to have to reload from scratch)<br>
But once you get used to it, it actually makes for a much more tense and tighter feel to the game.<br>
Having said all this, I still haven’t finished it lol.<br>
Anyone know of any other titles without the save option?</p>
