Stronghold fans rejoice! Special HD Editions of Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader are set for digital release next month on GOG, Amazon, GetGames and other notable online retailers.
Stronghold HD and Stronghold Crusader HD update the classic castle building games with high definition graphics and the ability to view an entire battlefield on a single screen. Due to popular demand, [b]the medieval strategy games have been remastered to support resolutions up to 2560x1600. Also featured is the new HD battlefield view, which allows players to zoom out and play in real-time with the entire map on one screen.[/b] Players can advance on the castle gates while flanking the enemy from behind, feign retreat and lead their foes into a deadly trap or just sit back and watch the destruction unfold.

Stronghold HD tasks players with 21 missions and four renegade lords to defeat. Missions range from breaking sieges and capturing enemy castles to raising gold and holding off enemy attacks, with the ultimate goal of reuniting medieval England. Also featured is an economic campaign, with missions revolving around gathering resources and building weapons within a time limit.

Stronghold Crusader HD shifts from Europe to the Middle East during the First, Second and Third Crusades. This fan favourite sequel to the original Stronghold introduces fiendish AI opponents, new units, new characters, 4 historical campaigns and over 100 unique skirmish missions. Stronghold Crusader HD comes packaged with content from both the Stronghold Warchest and Stronghold Crusader Extreme, including an increased unit cap of 10,000, new missions and special Tactical Powers.

[b]Firefly Studios today announced that players will be able to upgrade their existing copies of Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader and Stronghold Crusader Extreme to the new HD versions for free via a downloadable patch, provided that they already own a copy of the game. Tomorrow Stronghold HD and Stronghold Crusader HD will go on sale at 12:00 CET on GOG, Amazon, GetGames and DotEmu. As a thank you to existing fans for their years of support, owners of Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader and Stronghold Crusader Extreme will be able to download a patch for their game that upgrades it to the new HD version. The free HD patches will be available initially on GameFront and GamersHell. Full instructions on how to download the patches will be given out tomorrow when the games go live.[/b][/indent]
