    <description>What was your first reaction to... (in HL2)
Lamarr?

Vortigaunts?

(In HL1)
All of the aliens?

(In portal)
The turrets?

GLaDOS?

The lack of aliens?







--------------------------------

Personally, my first time with HL2 was with a friend who figured out how to cheat before they updated it, so I walked around with a magnum everywhere, so when Lamarr jumped at me, I shot her accedentally and Kleiner kept talking to her like nothing happened.

The same with the vortigaunt in the train thing, I jumped in with my shotgun, paniced and shot it. Since I played some of Blue Shift before HL2, I hated those bastards.</description>

<p>They could make you lose the game if that happens. Like in Half Life 1 when you kill a key NPC(P.E. scientists in Questionable Ethics)</p>

            <p>Portal was the first modern game I ever played. A friend showed the first few levels to me and I ran out and bought the Orange Box so I could play it (and this got me into HL2 and then all the other Half Life games and generally started the addiction…). I bumped into the first turret and grabbed it to stop it from falling over. Like I said, I had no experience with first person shooters so I hadn’t yet learned that almost everything you meet tries to kill you. When the turret plaintively said “Please put me down” I thought “Oh, sorry” and did as it asked. Then it pumped a few hundred rounds into me and killed me…</p>

            <p>I didn’t have much of a reaction to Lamarr because I wanted to see if Barney would be turned into a headcrab zombie  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>For the first vort in HL2 though I shot him the face a few times. This brings up another thing I said after I stopped shooting and realized he was a friend, “Why no friendly fire!?!” I think HL2 should have had friendly fire.</p>

            <p>When I first played, never even really thought about it. When I first played HL2 I hadn’t played the original yet. Portal, same thing.</p>

            <p>Lamarr? I tried to shoot it. But I had no weapon, fuck. So I waited for Barney to shoot it.</p>
<p>Vortigaunts?The same that Lamarr.</p>
<p>(In HL1)<br>
All of the aliens?First I saw the zombies and I got scared. I was six year old when I first played HL(1999). I didn’t play it again for a week, until I gathered courage and could run into that corridor full of monsters. However I couldn’t go further than the tentacles’ silo in Blast Pit, it was too hard for a child like me. I played it again two years later, and won the game. I think not knowing a shit about the game(since I didn’t use internet to investigate and didn’t even know what it was about when I bought it)and taking so much time to finish it was what made it so epic</p>
<p>(In portal)<br>
The turrets?I didn’t give much importance to em.</p>
<p>GLaDOS?I hated it from the first time.</p>
<p>The lack of aliens?I thought the game was set before Black Mesa’s incident. Then I noticed I was wrong, so I just think it’s set in distant future, when by someway the aliens had their ass kicked out off the earth, and it looks that most of  humans too.</p>

            <p>I remember shooting Lamarr with the magnum, and my friend was sitting next to me. His reaction to what I did was:<br>
“What the fuck are you doing, that’s Kleiner’s pet!”</p>
<p>I remember Nove Prospect too, when the Antlions were your allies. I got so fucking pissed off and scared when they poped out of the ground that I always shot the first one, then I got used to it. After that, I got to the next hole, crapped my pants, shot the first antlion etc. etc.</p>

            <p>I shot the vort in the train car when i first played hl2. I dropped down, spun around and had a vort in my face. That in not a way to introduce your self as a now friendly alien race to trigger happy Gordon Freeman.</p>

            <p>Lamarr- “Who the hell keeps a headcrab as a pet?”<br>
Vortigaunts- Don’t like them. Sarcastic bastards.<br>
Aliens- DIE DIE DIE DIE <em>Wastes all ammo shooting them</em><br>
Portal turrets- SQUEE. So adorable! &lt;3<br>
GLaDOS- Bitch. Hilarious bitch, but still a cow.</p>

            <p>Was pretty grossed out by the silky new Vortigaunts in Ep2. Instant erections for days once I heard Candyman’s voice coming out of them instead of the dad from Raisin in the Sun.</p>
