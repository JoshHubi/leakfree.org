    <description>Hello,

I wonder why does commands like sv_airaccelerate and sv_accelerate doesnt exist at all in BSM. console writes &quot;unknown command&quot; in both. On other source games these commands work as intended. Also fps_max doesn&#39;t work at all. Is it some kind of bug or its working as intended?</description>

            <p>The cvars you’ve listed are actually still present in the game itself, just “hidden”. Games such as CS:S and CS:GO take the liberty of making these commands easier to manage.</p>
<p>If you wish to change them for singleplayer, your best bet would be either to use startup commands such as +sv_airaccelerate </p>
<p>Additionally, using third party server plugins for multiplayer servers, such as SourceMod, you are able to view and change the values of hidden cvars freely at will:</p>

            <p>Yeah I can confirm those console commands are gone. That and sv_maxspeed (which allowed to make a walk command by changing the normal speed to sv_maxspeed 90 or so). It’s pretty surprising to see simple console commands that would allow to customize singleplayer/multiplayer experience disappear. Is there a reason for that ?</p>
