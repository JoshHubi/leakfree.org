    <title>What is everyone doing on Xen?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-everyone-doing-on-xen/11391</link>
    <description>One thing that I never quite understood about the back story of [i]Half-Life[/i], and which is unfortunately never explored in the later games, is everything that came [i]before[/i] the events of the first game.

It appears that the folks at Black Mesa have been going in and out of Xen for quite some time. To stress this point: Humans have been 1) aware of the existence of aliens, 2) developed teleportation technology, and 3) visited and looted the world of Xen, and all this for quite possibly a considerable amount of time.

Now, there&#39;s no indication that &quot;normal&quot; people in the world of the game are aware of any of these facts. To put it in realistic terms, any single of those items would come to a real person of the early 2000s (as well as to us in 2012) as a profoundly shocking piece of news, comparable to the actual discovery of Atlantis, or perhaps even the actual return of the Christian messiah. It would be hard to imagine something more astonishing.

Yet somehow, a pretty sizable number of people must be in on all this. How does that work? How come nothing of this leaks out?

Now a more important point: The HECU military seems to have been going in and out of Xen [i]as well[/i], as we can tell from all the leftover military equipment on Xen (e.g. the tank seen during the end sequence). But that can only mean that the HECU and the Black Mesa scientists have been collaborating for quite some time, too! Does that mean that a permanent HECU detachment has been installed at Black Mesa all this time? That [i]would[/i] explain why there are several garage-type buildings in place that seem to be designed to service tanks.

That would also explain why the military was so quick to arrive on the scene. On the other hand, it would be quite at odds with the initial airlift sequence of [i]Opposing Force[/i] (although Adrien Sheperd could have been part of the reinforcements coming from further afield), but also with the callous willingness on part of the soldiers to slaughter civilians. If they&#39;d been living and working with the scientists for a long time, would they not have some reservations  against shooting scientists at point-blank and dumping the bodies into the sewers? Don&#39;t marines have some sort of code of honour?

Anyway, in short, my question is how much everyone had been in on the whole alien invasion thing before the resonance cascade even happened. Also, I suppose, when Gordon re-emerged in HL2, why didn&#39;t he stop and ask any one of all the ex-BM people what had happened, and how long people had know how to teleport around, and what else they were keeping from him?</description>

            <p>the reason the HECU could respond so fast was G-MAN planned the resonance cascade and had the HECU prepared for deployment to black mesa specifically. it was in shepherds diaries</p>
<p>as for how information didn’t leak out. well for starters even if you did give away information you’d be labeled a tin foil wearing crackpot</p>

            <p>I guess more soldiers were teleported to Xen to protect the scientists.</p>
<p>If u look at the movie Stargate, the first time they go through the gate, there was one scientist (Daniël) with a group of soldiers</p>

<p>I always interpreted that as the way the Gman is able to make Gordon see things. They’re on Xen, but the Gman can project images or sceneries, such as the destroyed tanks to show him what’s going on on earth.</p>
<p>It’s cool how weird things can always be explained by the gman’s special powers  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I guess it’s on Earth, but it’s completely changed to Xen atmosphere (a view the Gman wants to give to Gordon what’s going to happen if he doesn’t help him)</p>

            <p>well normally it would look stupid as soon as the player walks to the edge and realizes that the sky is a box, but at the end of the game you pretty much have no room to walk around so it would have been totally fine in that case</p>

            <p>After you defeat Nihilanth, you fade to black, then fade in to a Xen elevator with the G-man talking to you.  There is a Xen skybox in this scene.  Then there is a transportation effect and then you’re on the desert map with the remains of the HECU.  You are simply transported to a different part of the same map.  In order to change skyboxes, they would’ve had to have a loading screen during the transportation effect, then you’re teleported back to Xen with a return to the Xen skybox, which would necessitate another loading screen.</p>

            <p>ST’s and Xen’s skyboxes are two completely different chapters (or a group of chapters, speaking about Xen), which means completely different maps.</p>
<p>I think GoldSrc was unable to change the skybox without loading a new map, which I’m pretty sure they changed with Source.</p>

<p>Then how did they change from Surface Tension’s skybox to Xen’s skybox? Why couldn’t they just change it for that particular scene?</p>

            <p>Given BM is government-funded, the government itself would presumably be kept in the loop with the goings on there, and, even more likely, would be directing the facility in areas they want researched.  This would be consistent with the development of weaponry eg. gluon gun, tau cannon, given how military-focussed the US are.  Also, it definitely would not be unlike the US to send a military task force into an “unowned”, potentially dangerous, poorly understood location, i.e. Xen, once the scientists had established stable teleportation there.  It strikes me as perfectly reasonable, therefore, that the HECU could have been on Xen.  Had they been there, they’d have had first-hand knowledge of the dangers of the creatures there, which would be consistent with their rapid response to <span class="bbcode-i">contain</span> BM after the resonance cascade.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean to say they were actually there, of course.  The arguments for the lack of evidence in the game seem fairly sound.</p>

            <p>The nuclear warheads in Black Mesa were there to be decommissioned. I assume whatever parts within the missiles that were able to be used for their own testing would be an added plus.</p>

</aside>
<p>First who says bm wasnt a military contracor (weapon research as Tau and Gluon, missile silos, I suppose not only for civilian use…)? In fact, the HECU were part of BMRF (at least a part of them, just look at the Rocket Launcher for example).</p>
<p>I think that some Facilities may have been autonomic (in bureaucratic sense) and thus could have been either a civilian OR military-type contractor</p>

<p>Anyways, why would a private research company want those missiles? They wouldn’t ever need them. It makes no sense.</p>

<p>Black Mesa was a civilian contractor, not military. And it’s hinted that nobody outside of the facility, even the military, knew about Xen.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, but there is an area that is under military administration. The places you visit in Surface Tension, like the missile storage. I mean, why would the government let a private contractor mantain an arsenal of mass destruction devises stored in a military-like facility ?</p>
