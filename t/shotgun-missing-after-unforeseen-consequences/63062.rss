    <title>Shotgun missing after Unforeseen Consequences</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shotgun-missing-after-unforeseen-consequences/63062</link>
    <description>I had a pistol and a shotgun up until I found an SMG. Once the SMG was equipped in slot 3, the shotgun disappeared from slot 4.Can&#39;t pick up a new one. Is this a bug or expected behavior?</description>
