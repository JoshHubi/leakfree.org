    <description>At what number is a game/film series dead?
I would go for around 4, but then it seems they start making Xgame 3: The X chronicles 2, or just Xgame: X.

Well I say 4 because of CNC4 :meh:

what do you guys think?:retard:</description>

<p>Yes you can.  It just shows the regular shotgun model and only has 2 shells and you can’t reload.  I don’t care as much when the weapon seems worse than anything you have, only when it’s better.</p>

            <p>There is no number.  Its only what the game developer makes it.  Like resident evil, if you ask me it stopped being fun after RE4 (i know there was 0 and code veronica). RE5 was a complete bummer in my book. i quit playing after 2 chapters.</p>
<p>With Left 4 Dead i think they can go to a Left 4 Dead 3 if they put WAY more effort than they did 1 and 2.  Such as A lot more weapons and a more misleading world.</p>
<p>Now for Armed Assault,  I hope they make a Third with even BETTER graphics. Even thought II had uberawsmefantasticextravaganso graphics its probably unlikely that if a 3rd is made its gonna have different graphics.</p>
<p>For those of you who need to pull their hhead out of their ass here is Armed Assault II:<br>

<p>Not only that, but it was called Final Fantasy exactly B/C of what Deimos said, G4 did a thing on Nobuo Uematsu, the guy behind the music for every game so far but 13, and he had said that Square was a failing company, if the game didn’t work it would literally be their final fantasy game.  It worked, and because people loved it, the name just stuck.</p>

            <p>I didn’t say Crysis was like Halo 2, I’m just saying the gameplay video we got from E3 made Crysis 2 look like Halo 2 with a face lift and a fancy watch.</p>

            <p>The gameplay demo wasn’t too amazing, but some of the screenshots seems to show a somewhat more open world for Crysis 2. In anycase, Crysis never felt to me like Halo 2, even when it became more linear, so I’m not concerned.</p>

<p>Yes, since it’s going from Predator: The Game (with really neat-looking, though somewhat-uninteresting-to-fight-aliens) to Generic Humanoid Alien Shooter.  It’d be like if they totally removed any ability for you to cause havoc in Roller Coaster Tycoon.</p>

<p>13, because how many more fucking Final Fantasies are there going to be before they get to the FINAL fantasy. I really don’t ‘get’ those games to be honest…</p>

<p>Actually, if I’m correct, all the games have no relationship between each other. Each game has a different plot, with different characters. So if I’m right (which i don’t know if i am d <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  then they’re all different games with no sequel d: Again, I’m not completely sure, considering Ive never felt like playing those games.</p>
