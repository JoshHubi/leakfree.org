    <title>What is needed ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-needed/13727</link>
    <description>Hello, I did a search but was still unsure of what I need

As an old veteran of the original &#39;Half-Life&#39; this mod really interests me, but I am completely new to way games are played on current Pc&#39;s, so I have some questions:

1, Do I need to purchase Half-Life 2 on Pc to play this (I only have the Xbox360 &#39;Orange&#39; box version) and I own the &#39;Game Of The Year&#39; original Pc version of Half-life with Blue Shift etc) ?

2, If I need to purchase the &#39;Pc version&#39; of Half Life 2, can I just buy and use the retail version or do I have to make a purchase via Steam for Black Mesa to work ?

3, When the game is installed can I un-install Steam and just play &#39;Black Mesa&#39; or do I have to keep an installation of steam, of which I am uncomfortable with and prefer to play my games from physical discs ?

Thanks for your time to answer my questions  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>You will not be charged for anything, nor do you need the original Half-Life.</p>

            <p>Great, so I do not need to spend any money or does Steam charge you ? Do I need to install the original ‘Half Life’ disc from 1999 or so ?? because at the moment it is not installed on my current PC ??</p>

            <p>Steam is required to play. You do not need any purchased games to play Black Mesa. From Steam, you have to download the Source SDK Base 2007 base. It is under the “tools” section on Steam, and is free for anyone to download and install. Once you have installed the Source SDK Base 2007, you can then install Black Mesa. You must then run Black Mesa from Steam to play it. If you’re uncomfortable with Steam, once you’ve installed everything, you can run it in offline mode, if so you desire.</p>
