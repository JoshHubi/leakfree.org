    <description>I was wondering about Wheatley&#39;s place in the storyline. When was he activated? What did he do to get him detached from GLaDOS and listed as &quot;corrupted?&quot; So I came up with this:

1: Wheatley is responsible for the infamous BYDTWD.
When activated, GLaDOS had Wheatley attached to her, and Wheatley (who is programmed to make bad decisions) promptly floods the enrichment center with neurotoxin. I mean seriously, why would GLaDOS waste all the lives of those valuable test subjects?

2: Wheatley is responsible for the crap turrets.
He said he almost had a job in the turret factory, but the Foreman decided not to give him the job. I&#39;m guessing Wheatley might have had the job for a few seconds, but in that time screwed up the production system so royally that the best ratio of good turrets to crap turrets they could possibly get is 1:1. (even with Aperture&#39;s odd way of going about business it seems odd that FIFTY PERCENT of their turrets are blind, bulletless, armorless, laserless, broken wrecks.) Instead, Wheatley was placed in charge of keeping the test subjects healthy, which is automated by the Announcer anyway and who cares about the test subjects&#39; well-being?

3: The Announcer isn&#39;t really prerecorded messages, but an actual AI.
The Announcer seems to have limited AI already (able to sense and respond to people on the turret redemption lines, able to pick up and interpret vague answers during a stalemate, etc.) but I mean actual AI. In Wheatley&#39;s &quot;almost got a job&quot; story, he said the Foreman made a duplicate of himself run the factory. Guess who is running the factory? The Announcer. Ta-daa.

4: Chell is the adopted daughter of Caroline.
Yeah, I already touched on this. No more need...

EDIT 5: Chell isn&#39;t out of Aperture Science yet.
If I remember right, I saw a promotion for Portal 2 that showed Aperture was planning on building a farm for giant chickens. The farm would contain a blue sky, fluffy white clouds, AND A WHEAT FIELD.

So, that&#39;s all I have. Feel free to comment on these theories and/or leave theories of your own here.  :smiley:</description>

            <p>They would have to find it first. They knew where black mesa was because the scientists there had already created a bridge to Xen. As far as I know Aperture didn’t create interdimentional bridges, just really expensive shower curtains.</p>

            <p>I’m starting to wonder how the Combine could have missed Aperture science.  They have some really beneficial technology the combine could have used.  So how could they not have known about it?  They pretty much know everything else on Earth.  My only thinking is that maybe that the Combine already has Portal technology or maybe Half-Life on Portal take place in alternate time lines (Yes, I went Zelda).  That would possibly explain how the Borealis went from being in the Arctic to deep down inside Aperture.  Unless of course it was moved down there between HL2 and Portal 2.  But Aperture looks way too undisturbed to show any signs of human interference (except for Chell).  Just my thinking.</p>

<p>No they didn’t cut them out, in the begining test chambers after waking glados you can see the energy ball shooters/catcher transitioning into a laser source/catcher. Also I read someone say Gman in Portal 1? NO! And that Caroline is Chell’s biological mother and that Johnson doesn’t know? NO, they look nothing like Chell in the portrait… unless Caroline fucked some asian dude for science. “What is that yoga?” “It increases the chance of conception.”</p>

            <p>Either way, I do have a discussion point about the “Only Want You Gone” song.</p>
<p>GLaDOS cryptically sings several times “That’s what I’m counting on”, referring to Chell leaving Aperture Science.  I wonder what this means.  Maybe GLaDOS is counting on Chell getting a group of humans together (if they’re still alive by this point in time, but I’ve already said that I believe that humans still exist due to the pretty well-tended nature of the wheat field around the shack) and come back to Aperture Science (Portal 3?) to fight GLaDOS, which is what she wants.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t believe in the theory that Chell is an android, but I also doubt the theory that she was adopted by Charline. Rosie’s theory seems pretty reliable, except from the fact that GLaDOS was created <span class="bbcode-b">after</span> BYDTWD.</p>
<p>Wheatley may have been the intelligence core which didn’t get incinerated (GLaDOS may have reacted that the core was out of reach from her like the “string” that came between her and the cores when they were unattached) and connected itself to a rail. His story before he got attached to GLaDOS is that he was made by aperture and almost got a job he wanted (there is no clue of what job, so the theory about him working with the turrets remains a conspiracy), but he instead got in charge of the test subjects. After a while he got attached to GLaDOS and makes her kill everyone but Chell and Ratman. If he didn’t kill Chell because she might help him out of the facility you can figure out.</p>
<p>Ratman, like all humans, can’t live 100 years, he even couldn’t survive 70 considering the dangers and medical disadvantages you can get from being too long in a test chamber. If he could have gone the wrong way and instead of leaving the enrichment center, he could have gone into stasis or in a relaxation vault, but Ratman knew too much about Aperture. He drew arrows pointing where to go to get to GLaDOS and escape, if he could move the panels, he could have made every single place in the walls to his dens. My theory is that Ratman either escaped or died before portal 1 and another human got into the enchantment center while Chell was in the relaxation vault before portal 2. GLaDOS said she saw some humans outside the facility and if they are outside it, it is a high chance of one just walking right in there.</p>
<p>But to be honest Ratman is like Gman. He is everywhere and lives forever, so they both have to be Valves versions of Jesus.</p>
<p>The personality Cores in general can’t just be a random AI. They have to be Apertures failed experiment to put a brain into a machine, they either failed and could only know one thing at the time or got corrupted/their information decayed over the time nobody could maintain them. I have already seen some episodes of History channels “Life after people” so I have a basic knowledge of the topic. The thing that I began wondering about was that the relaxation vaults looked so maintained and almost new even after some hundred years.</p>
<p>Shortened, my theories are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The intelligence core was active before GLaDOS and became Wheatley.</li>
<li>There were 2 “Ratmen”, one before Portal 1 and one between Portal 1 and 2.</li>
<li>Ratman is basically the same concept like Gman.</li>
<li>The personality cores are either a failed or successful experiment on AI mapping that decayed over time.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>i literally made an account for this.</p>
<p>1.GLaDOS was certainly not created <span class="bbcode-b">after</span> BYDTWD she is the one who flooded the neurotoxin.<br>
2.Wheatley specifically mentioned almost being on the turret assembly line, and that the announcer made a copy of himself to do it instead.<br>
3.Wheatley was never attached to GLaDOS other than what is plainly seen in game, in fact at the end he mentions how he had made a habit of waking up test subjects because he enjoyed watching them get killed, and that chell actually got as far as waking up GLaDOS which none of the others did.<br>
4.im not sure where you got 70 years from, but ratman began running from GLaDOS on or shortly after BYDTWD and shortly after that (given the mostly pristine state of repair aperture was in, in portal 1) was when chell was woken. because ratman put her file at the top of the list.<br>
5. portal two was 19 or 9 years after portal 1, im leaning towards 19 based off an article i read a little while ago.<br>
6. the personality cores where made after GLaDOS in order to inhibit her, or act as her conscience, Chell destroyed the working ones in the first game and the deactivated ones (presumably the failed early versions) came online.<br>
7. as for the gman thing, i remember something about a gman sighting in portal 1, but i dont think ratman is anything like him, in that you know basically everything about ratman at this point, and he was clearly a good guy, gman on the other hand has questionable motives at best, and we know nothing about him.</p>
