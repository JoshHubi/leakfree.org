    <description>Hey this is just going to be a quick post. I&#39;ve got as far as the rails just after you kill the giant flame thrower alien. I just wanted to quickly register and say that so far the new music in the game has been fantastic, it&#39;s really stood out as i have been playing it and really gets me into the game. Well done for all the people that worked on it and in this case especially the music team, I&#39;m really loving the tunes so far, thanks for the awesome remake  :slight_smile:</description>
