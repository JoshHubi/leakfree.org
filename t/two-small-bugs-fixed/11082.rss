    <title>Two small bugs [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/two-small-bugs-fixed/11082</link>
    <description>Hello,

I found 2 errors during my playthorugh:

EDIT: just realized they both are already reported. Sorry.

1) On the backside of the dam (where the Ichthyosaur is) in the water on the lower left corner of the dam are two &quot;holes&quot; in the map, so it just shows the skybox.

2) I have a really annoying problem: sometimes, the crosshair and the messages for quickload and quicksave disappear. Not sure if this is inteded and there is a button for it I accidently hit, but without cosshair the game gets a little bit harder  :slight_smile:  I think it has something to do with the quickloading/saving process (or with the german subtitles?). Only fix is to restart the game. 

My system:
Intel Core i7 920 6GB DDR3
Geforce GTX 280
Win 7</description>
