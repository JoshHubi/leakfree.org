    <title>closecaption_*.dat compiling incorrectly + X360 in-game buttons</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/closecaption-dat-compiling-incorrectly-x360-in-game-buttons/15182</link>
    <description>Hello there! I have a problem with compiling closecaption_russian.dat with captioncompiler.exe. Every time I compile this file and copied to the correct folder in custom .vpk, the game crashes with an error &quot;Invalid file ID&quot;. Can someone help me with compiling  of this subtitles? Giving me correct instruction or compiling it correctly by yourselves? I can&#39;t wait for official fix for russian localisation and i wanted to fix it by myself (put in missing &lt;sfx&gt; and correct translation of few lines), but this error is driving me crazy for 2 weeks.

&lt;a class=&#39;attachment&#39; href=&#39;/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3ddf0e2c70c1db0985d4da69353ae74940754d3f.txt&#39;&gt;closecaption_russian.txt&lt;/a&gt; (784 KB)

And can someone tell me, how to enable ingame controller button icons that in &quot;Black Mesa\hl2\hl2_textures_dir.vpk\materials\vgui\fonts\buttons_32.vtf&quot;? I remember that in CSGO there was file &quot;button_32.VBF&quot;, and these icons works in game perfectly.

P.S. Sorry 4 my eng.</description>

            <p><span class="bbcode-s">I’ve compiled a vpk for you with closecaption_russian.dat using your closecaption_russian.txt. See if that one works. It works fine on my system placed in a custom folder (which is mounted in gameinfo.txt).</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s"></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT 2017-05-29:</span> Apparently, you <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/1291816880506075245/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">solved</a> the issue yourself.</p>
<p>Just to add some general info, the error “Invalid file ID” means that the engine couldn’t find the correct file header in the .dat file, which means that the .dat file must be either empty or completely corrupt.</p>
<p>Also, captioncompiler.exe uses the same file loading system as the game’s engine, which means you’ll need to setup a custom folder in gameinfo.txt, or it will just load the closecaption_…txt file from the official .vpks. The closecaption_…dat file is written to the “steamapps\Black Mesa\bms\resource” folder (make sure that folder exists), and you’ll need to move it to the “resource” folder in your mod’s folder/vpk, which is placed in your custom folder, in order for the game to use it (e.g., “steamapps\Black Mesa\bms\custom\closecaption_mod\resource”).</p>
