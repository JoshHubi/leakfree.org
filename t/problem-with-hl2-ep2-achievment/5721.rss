    <title>Problem with HL2: EP2 achievment</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-with-hl2-ep2-achievment/5721</link>
    <description>Hi guys.

So, I don&#39;t know why, but I can&#39;t get the achievement &quot;Little Rocket Man&quot;.
I took that cursed gnome the entire game with me - except of the parts where I was going to return, like the autogun sequence, situations when I left the gnome on a easy place to find again.
I&#39;ve placed it inside the rocket two times know, on the same open hatch where Lammar enters.

In case you think I cheated, I didn&#39;t. Here&#39;s my Steam profile:
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976660739[/url]
You can see there that I unlocked &quot;Neighrborhood Watch&quot; also. It was just 5 minutes ago.

I am considering that my internet connection went down by the times when the rocket lauched, but I really don&#39;t know.

H.P.

EDIT: I forgot to say: just after I closed the game, on my game screen on Steam, EP2 was &quot;Syncing&quot;. I don&#39;t why, because I don&#39;t play my Steam games on other computers.</description>

            <p>It’s a shame that I don’t know how to record a game on a video archive.<br>

<p>Yes, I hadn’t thought of that. Didn’t think someone wouldn’t close the hatch, but the first time I played it I forgot to get Eli to do his blessing-scene, and had to start over.</p>
