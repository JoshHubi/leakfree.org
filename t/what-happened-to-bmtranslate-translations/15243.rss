    <title>What happened to bmtranslate translations?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-happened-to-bmtranslate-translations/15243</link>
    <description>I was part of the Brazilian Portuguese translation team back in 2012, where Black Mesa wasn&#39;t even released. If I recall correctly, we had finished the translation of captions and the interface, but for my surprise the Brazilian Portuguese translation is not shipped. Why is that? Is it possible to it shipped by default?</description>
