    <description>What will Gordon do on the Borealis?

What Aperture Science technology awaits?

Do you get to fly that Helicopter you were about to get into at the end of Episode 2, or does Alyx?

Speculate here!

(Nothing silly or baseless please. Start a silly thread for those.)</description>

<p>Metrocops were promised “non-mechanical reproductive simulation” as rewards for killing enough rebels. Although I’m not quite sure where that sound file was used.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, the full quote is “Rank leaders - reminder: one hundred sterilized credits qualifies non-mechanical reproduction simulation”, and I think it’s just generally played while the metrocops are idle. It’s kind of ambiguous as to whether the simulation or the reproduction is non-mechanical.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there’s another quote played when they kill Gordon that says “Reward notice: Protection Team member, your family cohesion is preserved”, which presumably means their families won’t be relocated away from them if they brutalize/kill enough rebels. The Combine sure do know how to motivate people when they need to.</p>

</aside>
<p>With a rifle you aim at your enemy, then click until they die then reload.<br>
With a gravity gun you find something around you that’s not too big, too small, or too far away, click it, then aim at your enemy, compensate for the weight &amp; distance than click again.<br>
Sure, using the gravity gun might seem simple &amp; mindless with experience, but it’s a totally different experience compared to adding another generic bullet or energy spraying weapon.</p>

            <p>I think it’s just a reasonable assumption that they have cloning technology. Look at the synths - they can obviously produce them efficiently and if they have the ability to genetically modify creatures to that degree, cloning would be a cake-walk.</p>
<p>I have a pet theory that the reference to “non-mechanical reproduction” in one of the Overwatch’s lines refers to non-cloned procreation, implying cloning is more familiar to them than sexual reproduction.</p>

<p>Good point! I wasn’t even thinking about it like that.</p>
<p>Then again, they could probably come up with a more shocking revelation than clones. Maybe something about the Borealis… and then there’s that weird theory that Eli isn’t human because the adviser couldn’t levitate(?) him at the end of EP2. I think he’s human, and Valve decided to have him on the ground to heighten the tension; Alyx and Gordon being held back, looking down on Eli without being able to help him… that’s besides the point, though.</p>

This proves my theory: Valve is indeed part of the Combine, and Gabe is an Adviser. The person on the lower left is (your name here). Everything about this picture make perfect sense- that’s why I love it.</p>

<p>That would suck. They’ve been teasing us with their presence since the start of HL2, they’ve flawnted their psychokinetic powers by ripping through the roof of a barn, they killed Eli &amp; yet there are still people who think they’d be downgraded to a regular mook? Do you actually think that near the end of the next Half-Life they’ll just suddenly introduce some Combine Overlord to steal all their thunder? It was pretty lame when they did it with the Nihilanth, it would be even lamer if they did it again.</p>

<p>You say that since the leaders are the only ones that are important, it doesn’t matter if the humans are kept alive or not. My point is that they could have killed them all or turned them all into stalkers or soldiers, that way the combine never would have had to worry about an uprising to begin with.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know about roller mines, scanners, turrets, vehicles and helicopters, etc. The robots we don’t see are ones capable of replacing the larger enemies- no robot soldiers, for instance, or robot striders. We don’t see robots maintaining automated mining systems- things like that. The Combine seems to have a thing for biological engineering- maybe it’s easy for them to grow things then to build them.</p>
<p>I suppose the Combine is resourceful, but only as much as they have to be. Maybe they found a way to clone soldiers with engineered organs, but they still see it reasonable to use what’s left of humanity as well. Once the supply runs out, they’ll go to the vault and bring out some clones. Maybe they’ve been using clones for a while. Perhaps we even killed some during HL2/EP1&amp;2. Who would know the difference?</p>
<p>As for my point about the advisers- there’s been discussion before about the leaders of the combine. Perhaps the advisers are the original species which started the empire, or perhaps they are facilitating the needs of an unseen species- if true it would add to the whole “slavery” theme which has been seen so much throughout HL.  My point about the hierarchy was more about the insignificance of anything other than the leaders of the Combine.</p>
<p>At this point, I can see everyone at Valve laughing behind their wheeled desks as we scramble to figure out what the hell the motives are of the Combine, Gman, etc.</p>
<p>You know what? Maybe Valve is a part of the Combine! They <span class="bbcode-i">feed </span>on the desperation and confusion of Half Life fans (let’s not even think about the surgical procedure used to turn humans into Valve employes- something they call “hiring”). It would explain the lack of proper communication they have with their fans. Gabe is obviously the local adviser- it’s why his interviews are so “captivating”. :lol:</p>
<p>Joking aside, does anyone like my theory from a few posts back? The one about not being able to use the helicopter, evacuating the base, etc.</p>

<p>Since they have so much resources &amp; advanced technology like robots, then why bother with humans? why bother with earth at all? Why not kill everyone on the planet, then use robots to harvest all the resources?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>…ask Valve this question. Or better yet, ask the Combine. It’s a good question.</p>
<p>Does the Combine even have robots? It seems they prefer to rely on bioengineering- hybrids of organisms and machines. Unless I’m forgetting something, I don’t think we have ever seen a totally robotic combine enemy aside from the occasional turret. (Heck, even Aperture made better turrets- they talk and come in many designer colors!)</p>
<p>I suppose that on each of the planets they conquer, they exploit whatever species they can to fit their needs on that planet and other planets under combine control. Perhaps humans are being used on other combine planets wherever they can be useful (wasn’t there a reference to this somewhere?).</p>
<p>The Combine doesn’t seem to think highly of human intelligence. The way I see it, the combine hierarchy is as follows:</p>
<p>Original Combine species on top<br>
Advisers (unless they <span class="bbcode-i">are</span> the original) are middlemen<br>
Laborers are conquered species</p>
<p>Makes sense, I guess.</p>
<p>EDIT: Don’t forget about that newly discovered third kind of elementary particle: The Freemanon. It obeys Kliener-Vance Statistics. These particles react violently with Fermions and Bosons, causing seemingly impossible reactions where 200% of the mass is converted into energy. Such collisions occured during the explosion at the end of HL2, totally eradicating Dr. Breen; wiping him off the fabric of the universe itself. Thus, he’s gone and it’s settled.</p>
<p>EDIT (again): If my bogus explanation/overused joke about that one stupid line from the end of HL2 hasn’t convinced you that Breen is dead for good, I don’t know what will.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Why is this still “Episode” speculation, I thought they scrap that idea?</p>

<p>I think the host body was a minor point. Creating one for him was probably as easy as pie for the Combine, considering their advanced knowledge of biology and their vast resources. This is also Valve’s way of telling us that their world is inhospitable to humans.</p>

<p>It seemed (IMHO) that their <span class="bbcode-i">ultimate</span> intention was to take all the resources they need from Earth, eradicate humans, and to get some use out of the humans they turned into soldiers until they drop dead.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Since they have so much resources &amp; advanced technology like robots, then why bother with humans? why bother with earth at all? Why not kill everyone on the planet, then use robots to harvest all the resources?</p>

<p>I doubt the Combine’s ultimate intention was to give humans host bodies. Breen had a position of some importance.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, Breen did talk about humans becoming immortal in his second Breencast. Maybe the Combine’s intention was to weed out the few humans they thought actually deserved a host body &amp; allow them to join the Combine forever.</p>

<p>The reason we don’t see the dead body is because it was destroyed, or to be more precise, obliterated in that giant explosion.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But he wasn’t near the explosion as far as we could see. And the whole “no dead body” thing is just a way of saying that since we didn’t specifically see him die (compared to say, Eli) that there’s always the chance he’ll come back. Although things might have changed what with Robert Culp’s death &amp; all.</p>

<p>It probably had something to do with the Freemanutrinos, Gordonuclei, and other particles Breen referred to. (See what I did there?)  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Cute.</p>
