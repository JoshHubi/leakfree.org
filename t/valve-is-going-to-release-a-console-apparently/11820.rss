            <p>What would be even better is if we could make our own “Steam-Boxes”</p>
<p>I know there are methods going around for Ubuntu to auto-launch steam in Big Picture mode but that seems choppy and boot-legged.</p>

<p>The “Steam Box” or w/e it will end up being called will most likely run “big picture mode”…Id assume that we are beta testing by being a statistic.  A steam console running on some sort of open source setup could have great potential, but at the end of day IN NO WAY could compete with a computer in any way aside from price.  However, spreading your influence to compete with the consolers could make for a great decision.</p>

</aside>
<p>They talked about it being a spec as well as a dedicated piece of hardware. They want it to be a living room box, like a console or a dvd player. That means low power fast booting and quiet. It would open up plenty of possibility for companies other than valve to build one with more features or a lower price but they would all work well enough to play valve games from steam</p>

<p>This is meant to “compete” with desktop PCs about as much as an iPad is meant to “compete” with an iPhone. They’re totally different products, so a 1:1 comparison is silly.</p>
<p>Valve is clearly trying to build an entertainment ecosystem for their users here. Not move beyond the PC or take on the Xbox and PS3.</p>

<p>Eh, it’s not a new thing. That scene of socially awkward idiots has been around longer than the internet. You can find old usenet threads full of the same shit. It’s kind of funny.</p>
<p>Of the many questions I have about this gadget (aside from its name, because “Steam Box” causes me physical pain to recite) is the price point. If this is competitively priced with the next consoles, I think it might even woo some people over. Hell, I’d buy one. If it’s not, I’ll stick with my HDMI cable and big picture mode, and most other people probably will to.</p>

<p>Isn’t it exactly the opposite of that?  Consoles are just Personal Computers customized to work specifically with games.</p>

            <p>You can’t call it a monopoly if one of the 2 major publisher sells its games and alllows to play online only through Origin(even if this platform sucks badly).</p>

<p>They have been far more committed to multi platform releases than any other game maker in history. If they pull a microshaft and try to lock down os and hardware then there will be an issue. Their move to OSX and playstation and their recent love of nerdux show otherwise</p>

            <p>“Monopoly” isn’t a term that should just be thrown around vaguely when you’re talking about market share.</p>
<p>According to most estimates about Valve’s revenue (1-2 billion per year), they make up about 1-2 percent of the gaming industry. Say Valve quadruples their size over the next 5 years. Still not even close to a monopoly.</p>

            <p>It’s only a monopoly if they’re the only company in the business. It’s like people calling Steam a monopoly or something. There’s plenty of alternatives.</p>

<p>Gabe has stated that valves method of fighting piracy has been simultaneous release over as many platforms as possible with no regional restrictions. This would only add to that, while giving them potential profit beginning to end of the game cycle. Software development, digital distribution and end hardware.  All they would need after that would be a TV business   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
