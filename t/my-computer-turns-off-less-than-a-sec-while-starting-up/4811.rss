    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-computer-turns-off-less-than-a-sec-while-starting-up/4811</link>
    <description>I know there are a lot of smart people lingering in these forums. So... here&#39;s my problem... Whenever I try to start my computer... my CPU turns off less than a sec as if it just lost power. I have to turn off then on the power box before I can start my computer again. Last week... I only had to do it once... then as time passed by... I had to do it 0-6 times. 

When I do get to my desktop and it doesn&#39;t turn off within 1 minute... then I can play continuously just like normal without the problem of my CPU turning off.

What&#39;s the cause? My motherboard, Video card, and Ram are new. I bought them before December 2009 because I thought black mesa would have been released and I wouldn&#39;t want to play one of the best game remakes in the world in low settings. My computer 6 years old but can still play bad ass games like L4D2 and COD4 with upgrades.

Help?:&#39;(</description>

<p>I didn’t have this problem before… till last week. I’ve decided to buy a new PSU since everybody said something about my PSU being not able to handle the job. Ill try hyperbytes suggestion first.Thanks for your time. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>There’s a lot of people out there who spend lots of money to build a fast gaming computer and they end up buying some shitty ass 50 dollar powersupply with extremely unstable voltages, horrible effiency, no protection on the 12v rails etc.</p>

<p>I throw in my vote for everything Hyperbyte said. sounds like the PSU isn’t throwing out enough power, or something is overheating and causing an automatic shutdown to protect the computer.</p>

<p>What’s the cause?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As read above, the power supply is a good bet.  But, if you’ve never had this problem before, and you haven’t attached any additional devices to your computer since this appeared, there are some other possible causes.</p>
<p>Personally, I would start by opening the case and blowing (with compressed air) as much dust out of there as possible, especially out of the power supply.  It could also help to unplug all cables running form the PSU and then plug them all in again one-by-one (all this while the computer’s power cord is disconnected of course).</p>
<p>You could also try to <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=6007" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">reset the CMOS memory of your motherboard</a>, especially if you have been adjusting the settings in there recently.  This can also be caused by adjusting the processor speed (read: overclocking) from the BIOS.</p>

            <p>And whether or not you just upgraded.  Though whether you upgraded to something too power-hungry for the current PSU, or the PSU is just dying, you’ll still probably need to go buy a new one.</p>
