        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I had the same problem where I couldn’t go up the ladder near the end of the level…</p>
<p>THE PROBLEM:  If you jump onto the elevator shaft ledge to the left and then jump onto the ladder, the bottom half of the ladder does not quite line up with the top half of the ladder; and you can only go halfway up the ladder!</p>
<p>THE SOLUTION:  Reload the game, and make the big jump onto the ladder like you should.  The ladder will stay whole like it should.  (Default is to hold W and when ready to jump press Ctrl and Space.)</p>
<p>This is definitely a bug in the game, unless they just want to force us to make that long jump.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey, guys. This isnt really a “stuck” issue, but id like to know how to get into the room with the loot in it. Its the one that has the locked door right next to the cafeteria. In the original HL i just went in the vent in the beginning of that room and followed that path, but i cant seem to find any places to go after being on top of those vents above the room with the car and the two blast doors. Thanks, guys.</p>

            <p>Understandable, when you press and hold e the ledge goes one direction for a bit and then fully to the other, it’s one of those retarded half-life quirks.</p>

            <p>Or hurl a grenade in there. Also, earlier in the chapter a there’s a semi-hidden ladder you can climb, crawl around above the ceiling a bit and you’ll end up at a switch that deactivates that turret. Maybe look for that on your next playthrough. :freeman:</p>

            <p>There is another .357 up ahead, but I’m not sure how far away… There are probably dead security guards that will have one near their corpse.</p>
<p>Tell your followers to stand still below the stairs, and then go up and deal with the turret with the Glock.</p>

            <p>€: Ok scratch question no1. Found it.</p>
<p>Hi, got two questions:</p>
<p>1: I didn´t rescue the guy who´s friend turned to a zombie. Can I still get the revolver later? I don´t want to shoot the guard for it. ^^</p>
<p>2: I´m at the spot where there is a sentry gun above some stairs. Is it possible to deactivate that so my guard and scientist followers can make it up there? And the scientist following me… is she just there to die, basically, or can I get her to safety somehow?</p>

            <p>I’ve gotta agree that being closer would have helped make the “button” appear broken because the wheel is missing. If I recall, the wheel is around the far corner of the freezer from where it’s supposed to be affixed.</p>
<p>The mod drilled into my head that butane tanks, ladders, toolboxes, spanners, and any seemingly-useful props which are on a floor or shelf are unusable and should be ignored. Unless they’re sparking plugs on the ends of power-cords.</p>
<p>Red is a very common color for…well… <span class="bbcode-i">everything</span>, and I didn’t pick up on that code. I’m not sure I’d have noticed redness in the dreary cyan freezer anyhow… let alone the redness of some crap on the floor.</p>

            <p>Well if you had exhausted the freezer, you would have seen the crank on the floor. By then the game vocabulary should have been drilled into your head from the previous chapter: Red wheels/cranks are usable and should be used; Black wheels/valves are not.</p>
<p>It would have been better though if it were lying in front of where it should be placed rather than in the adjacent room.</p>

<p>In order to problem-solve, there has to be an observable problem.</p>
<p>The “problem” was a button not working. I went around looking for anything to bring power to the system. After exhausting the freezer and areas around it of possible triggers, coming to this topic was my only resort.</p>
<p>I already made it to Lambda Core without a hitch by the time I lodged my complaint here. I have a feeling I’ll be in that teleport soon without any other complaints.</p>

            <p>I found it pretty quickly and figured out almost immediately what it was for. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>It’s true though that anyone who hasn’t played Episode 1 would have zero idea what to do. It should be made more obvious.</p>
