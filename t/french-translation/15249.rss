    <description>Hi there !

So, played the game again, this time with the french subtitles, and I noticed that there is a lot of grammar errors in the text, as well as nonsensical things (I guess the person that did these subtitles is canadian, given there is a lot of &quot;tutoiement&quot; where it should be &quot;vouvoiement&quot; ; actually when you meet a new scientist or guard it is like you are meeting your best buddy ever, it is disturbing).

I may be able to help to improve this translation, so if the guy who did it in the first place need assistance with that, let&#39;s keep in touch !  :slight_smile:  

Thanks !</description>
