    <title>Building a new PC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/building-a-new-pc/2629</link>
    <description>That&#39;s right bros, I&#39;m in the market for a new PC and all suggestions are welcome, mainly just a new tower, but screen suggestions are good too.

My goal here is not state of the art, but more like a setup that will last me a couple of years and won&#39;t be too expensive. The ideal budget is $1000/€, although it may be pushed just a bit further if needed.

For the most part what I want is insight on what&#39;s hot right now without being too expensive.

So, post away boys. [img]https://www.themesshall.net/forum/images/smilies/tiphatyj7.gif[/img]

Edit: I&#39;m thinking of getting another GeForce 9800GT to connect in SLI with my current one. Unless someone has a better idea...</description>

<p>Been considering the 965. Pretty cheap and the overclock features are intriguing.</p>

<p>Yeah u can do it then, they wont conflict cause Win7 can have multiple video drivers running at the same time. It requires a small workaround patch because nvidia disabled the dedicated PhysX feature with their latest drivers, but its not hard to apply. You’ll also need to connect the nvidia card to either ur second monitor (if u have one) or connect it to the vga slot on ur monitor and have the ATi card go into the dvi slot, this creates a virtual monitor that u wont see, nor does it affect anything, but u can’t start up the nvidia control pannel if it isn’t connect to a monitor. If u decide to go with Nvidia + ATi ill send u the full intructions.</p>

            <p>Buy a XFX 5850 and use the 9800GT as a dedicated physX card, U’ll get better performance than two 9800GT’s is SLI plus u get an XFX 850w PSU for under $100 with that their 5850 one newegg (till 1/31).</p>
