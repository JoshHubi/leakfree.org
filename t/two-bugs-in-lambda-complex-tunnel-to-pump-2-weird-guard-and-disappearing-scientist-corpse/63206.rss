    <title>Two bugs in Lambda Complex tunnel to pump 2: weird guard and disappearing scientist corpse</title>

    <description>Hello, just two bugs I noticed in the Lambda Complex tunnel to the reactor coolant pump 02. Nothing game breaking. 

The guard who lets you in can follow you but would be (I assume) eventually blocked by the debris. However this guard bumps into an invisible obstacle and stops following you way before that, before you even turn the corner and see the debris.

On that debris is the corpse of a scientist; however, once the next map loads of the actual pump and resevoir, this scientist is gone. This is especially noticeable on the return to the reactor hub, as the player faces the scientist popping in before and after loading.</description>
