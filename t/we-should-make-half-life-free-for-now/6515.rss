    <description>Im telling,people are so inpatient for half-life source,and it.s free so why not just give the original one free for all people who has a source engine game,if you can have a source version of it for free,why not have lower graphic same game for free?</description>

            <p>But the original half life doesnt use source…<br>
Even then, the above posts are correct, its not a great idea for them in practically any way, for the fans, maybe, but not for valve</p>

<p>Glad to see we got back on topic.</p>
<p>Anyway, Half-Life is probably one of the highest rated games in history. People are still buying the damn thing now. Hence, Valve is still profitting off of Half-Life. If they gve it out for free then they’ll lose some profit, no matter how small. I think the day they make it free is the day everyone has it. Plus, if they do make it free, it’ll probably be out for less time than Portal. Which was five days. I think.</p>

</aside>
<p>NO you don’t get it!I mean that they make it free for the people who have Source based games!</p>

<p>Half-Life was created by Valve, a private video game company in the business of making and selling games.</p>
<p>Black Mesa is being made by fans.</p>
<p>It would be stupid for Valve to give up one of their products they sell because a fan-made mod was created.</p>
<p>Also, the Black Mesa developers do not make business decisions for Valve.</p>

            <p>Sure, but that doesn’t give Valve the obligation to give HL1 for free.</p>
<p>Besides, BM won’t be a carbon-copy of HL1, many things are different and even shorter than the original, so in a way, they’re still playing an original game that is heavily based on HL1.</p>

</aside>
<p>thing is, when BM is released, people who only own HL2 will be able to play pretty much the same game as HL for free. so OP is saying that people who, possibly after a playthrough of BM, wants to experience how the story originally felt, can do it for free.</p>

            <p>I wish they’d do the same as Doom. Make the source code freely available (completely; I know the old HL SDK had some source code with it). Then they wouldn’t lose any money being you’d still need the game files.</p>

<p>Avid is great, I love it. But maybe 1 in 10 editing jobs require Avid, if that. The only people I know who still use it as their primary NLE are television editors who are dealing with 1,000s of hours of footage and multiple cameras.</p>

            <p>And you’re wrong. FCP, FCS, Color, Compressor, Dvd Studio Pro, Motion…I could go on and on. These are all industry standard programs (you literally cannot work as a professional in video without FCP, and Color is as good or better than anything released by the Foundry), and they’re all Mac exclusives.</p>
<p>Apple is smart enough to know that having overpriced, underperforming hardware requires them to have exclusive software rights to make it worth the investment. It’s as simple as that – hence people in media industries own at least one Macintosh.</p>
<p>Which brings us right back to the age-old fucking obvious answer, which is that Windows/Linux are good for some things and Mac is good for some things, and anyone who bitches about any of them is just a retarded fanboy.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
