    <title>The overall quality of this place has lowered</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-overall-quality-of-this-place-has-lowered/9174</link>
    <description>If I wanted to read an inteligent debate about something I always had this forum in reserve. I never did contribute myself all that much but when I didn&#39;t post I could see how I could improve on my previous errors based on everypost around me. Since the release of new info I&#39;ve noticed a steady decline in the high-quality this place once had. 

I guess I&#39;m probably over exaggerating a bit much, but a month before the facebook release I could &quot;lurk&quot; here and still learn from every other post. Its only gotten much worse since the youtube video was leaked. I guess it is to be expected as only the veterans really stayed here while the BM team were dark but it is still unfortunate when I look back on it. 


This thread&#39;s discussion value is how the new people here because of the leaked footage are annoying.</description>
