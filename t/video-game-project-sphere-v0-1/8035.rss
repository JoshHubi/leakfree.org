Hello! I have a new game I have been working on for a while on and off. It&#39;s called SPHERE. &quot;But Phobos!&quot; You say. &quot;Why is it called SPHERE?&quot;. Well, let me explain...

The concept is simple; You collect these glowing squares to keep your health up (as it is always decreasing), while dodging enemy squares that can kill you (and the occasional giant-ass box of death), all on a 3D Sphere.

This is a simple game with no really complex features (Except the Sphere, of course.) I wanted to release an early version so I can get some feedback on how to change certain aspects and make it better!

Instead of some screenshots, I have an[b][OLD][/b] video that gives a general idea.

[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qki6mEJye3s[/url]

Controls are in the README.txt file and stuff.
Credits in the main menu by clicking on &quot;Credits&quot; in the lower-right.

A cool feature is the ability to add your own music! Just go in the music folder and edit the &quot;musiclist.ini&quot; thing in notepad. There are groups for certain difficultys, or you can have an &quot;always&quot; list that always picks one out of that group. (make sure to set &quot;forced list&quot; to 1 and set &quot;num&quot; to the number of songs added!)

Leave feedback/ideas and have fun!

I put that in quotes because I posted that on another forum and I was too lazy to write one for this. I also recommend you post high-scores!

<p>Perhaps you should develop this for the new version of Windows and release it as a Metro app in the Windows store.</p>
<p>There are already planned to be many small games for desktop and tablet devices running Windows 8.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, I just wanted to experiment with design ideas with this. I think my eventual BIG project will be a Deus Ex like 2D Platformer, where every choice you make effects you and the world around you, and exploring every crevese can lead to rewards!</p>
<p>Of course, I know something like this is very ambitious, but I have created many documentations on how I could carry out something like this!</p>
<p>Thanks for the criticism by the way!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I was for some reason thinking that the game was a spin off or in correlation to the movie Sphere with Dustin Hoffman from just reading the title.</p>
<p>To be honest it’s not something I would spend my time playing unless maybe I could get away with it at work.</p>
<p>Maybe try configuring the game to run on a smart phone and charge a dollar for it. Sell enough and you can make massive improvements. Or start a whole new game.</p>

            <p>Pretty cool, I have some suggestions<br>
-needs some stars, maybe rotating in the background or the sphere, a space theme goes well with the wireframe<br>
-Turn the player into an aweome looking space ship and the killer squares into astroids, maybe you made them squares to avoid looking like an asteroids clone, but the gameplay is different so who cares<br>
-player should leave a trail of smoke to add to difficulty<br>
-difficulty needs to ascend quicker</p>

<p>My friend snake5creator composed it all. I picked music from his library of around 200+ songs that he made. Most are loops, though.</p>
<p>EDIT: v0.2 is underway! I have the changelog for what to expect here:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>[v0.2]<br>
-Added Changelog. Lol.<br>
-Added debug functions [Or, in your case, cheat codes.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  ]<br>
-Added Highscore Table.<br>
-Added credits music.<br>
-Fixed STOP Powerup bug not preventing loss of health from enemy hits.</p>

<p>Hello! I have a new game I have been working on for a while on and off. It’s called SPHERE. “But Phobos!” You say. “Why is it called SPHERE?”. Well, let me explain…</p>
<p>The concept is simple; You collect these glowing squares to keep your health up (as it is always decreasing), while dodging enemy squares that can kill you (and the occasional giant-ass box of death), all on a 3D Sphere.</p>
<p>This is a simple game with no really complex features (Except the Sphere, of course.) I wanted to release an early version so I can get some feedback on how to change certain aspects and make it better!</p>
<p>Instead of some screenshots, I have an<span class="bbcode-b">[OLD]</span> video that gives a general idea.</p>

<p>Controls are in the README.txt file and stuff.<br>
Credits in the main menu by clicking on “Credits” in the lower-right.</p>
<p>A cool feature is the ability to add your own music! Just go in the music folder and edit the “musiclist.ini” thing in notepad. There are groups for certain difficultys, or you can have an “always” list that always picks one out of that group. (make sure to set “forced list” to 1 and set “num” to the number of songs added!)</p>
<p>Leave feedback/ideas and have fun!</p>
