            <p>To be honest, I think it all depends on the game and level design. Gears of War 2 is really brown and not so nice to look at compared to White Forest in Episode 2, but neither can hold a candle to most of Mass Effect 2, which IMO is nicer to look at than Crysis.</p>

            <p>It’s wrong to compare such screens because the don’t truly represent the possibilities of the engine itself.</p>
<p>The main difference is the technologies used and tools that help you use them in a proper way. The same scene built in Source might look nice but after adding a ton of eye candy from UE3 or CE3 might blow your mind…</p>
<p>Nonetheless we shouldn’t talk about Source just yet, we don’t know what Valve is preparing for us when HL3/Episode 3 comes out… I bet it’ll be mind blowing  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> .</p>

            <p>Mass has pretty much no impact on fall speed. That is a fundamental law of physics. As to air-resistance, it’s minimal on such a small scale, barring really large surface areas.</p>

            <p>I misspoke myself there. I do know that without gravity, there would be no falling. Well no movement at all, unless a force is applied. No need for a course to know that. The word I should’ve used these is air resistance, as Katana pointed out. (Don’t point out they’re two completely different things, I know that). And I’m fairly sure that mass and shape has a much bigger impact on falling speed than you say. And yes, I did and I still do.</p>
<p>IOW: Brain fart.</p>

<p>No. I don’t see what’s wrong with my post. If there’s no gravity or air, all objects, no matter their sizes or weight, would fall at the same speed. And as far as I know, with gravity and air present, an object’s falling speed is determined by its mass and shape.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So many things wrong with that post. First off, no gravity, no falling. Gravity pulls things towards the earth, or any other large mass, or even towards a small mass if its the largest thing there. Dropped from the same height in a vacuum, any two objects, regardless of mass, would fall at the same speed.<br>
So now onto the second part of all of this. Even with airresistance, you’ll find that most objects will fall at fairly similar speeds. Now obviously paper, with its tiny weight and massive surface area will slowly waft down, but bunch it up and you’ll find if falls at pretty much the same speed as a falling barrel or armor  (until you hit terminal velocity and all that fun stuff, which has no relevancy here). Did you never take physics or something?</p>

            <p>So it’s pretty obvious any physics system would take weight into consideration. What you mean then is air resistance, such that a piece of paper would fall more slowly.</p>
<p>Specifically, I think the issue with a lot of havok physics is it seems like they have a constant max velocity that’s set very low, such that a ragdoll blown away by a powerful spell will hover in the air from the attack.</p>

            <p>The physics in Oblivion were pretty much only there for the sake of it. I hope Skyrim makes better use of them.</p>

            <p>Didn’t Oblivion use Havok? Man those physics sucked. It would’ve been alot better if it took gravity and object’s weight into consideration, so a spoon and a barrel and your character wouldn’t all fall at the same slowey speed.</p>

            <p>Exactly. Which is why I’m frustrated when people just regard it as the same thing as other games like Doom 3.<br>
It’s like when someone tears down a house and builds one in the same spot, and someone says it’s the same house because you used a few of the old nails and lumber.</p>

            <p>Technically, Source does use Havok as the base for the physics engine but Valve has modified and tweaked it a lot to fit their needs.</p>

            <p>I personally think that vanilla Havok has some pretty shitty physics. They’re way too over-the-top.</p>
