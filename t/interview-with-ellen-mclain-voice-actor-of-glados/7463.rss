    <title>Interview with Ellen McLain (voice actor of GLaDOS)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/interview-with-ellen-mclain-voice-actor-of-glados/7463</link>
    <description>I want to bring to attention to you all for the recent voice interview with Ellen McLain (the voice actor of GLaDOS for both Portal games, the team fortress 2 announcer and also half-life 2&#39;s overwatch voice). I think this will be of interest to mostly Portal fans.The inerview is around 45 minutes long and done by a guy named caboos15 (you probably never heard of him), there is also a suprise guest, her husband John Patrick Lowrie (tf2 sniper voice actor).

I did this thread becouse i want more people to see this since it&#39;s a good interview and it doesn&#39;t have enough views.

Here you go lads: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR2UyCwtj-U...feature=related[/url]

Caboos15 also interviewed alot of other cool people, so you can check his other videos if you like</description>
