    <title>Tips and advices for a drawing test.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tips-and-advices-for-a-drawing-test/6716</link>
    <description>So yeah I&#39;m (maybe) going to take a 3D animation and image synthesis course in Cegep (something we have here between high-school and university), but to be admitted I have to pass a selection exam on drawing. 

I was sent an e-mail telling me that I was convened, and that the exam would test &quot;if I am able to reproduce a character, represent a scene and a character and to verify my comprehension or perception of spaces and volumes&quot;.

I need tips and advices on how to practice those. Thank you.</description>

            <p>I have used india ink and all that jazz before. Recently, even.</p>
<p>I really would rather not go to something as expensive and useless (in the real world, that is) as art school.</p>

</aside>
<p>So even though you’re a dick I’m going to talk to you about your work anyways because I really dig it. What do you use for your ink on your traditional media pieces, do you just use a sharpie or have you messed around with India ink and technical pens? Are you thinking about going to college for art? All of the professors I have ever met would eat you conceptual stuff up. Just a warning though, they will shove the technical basics down your throat before they will let you run with your own style. Anyways nice portfolio and you should give technical pens a try if you haven’t already, much more control and India ink is much more archival.</p>

<p>You’re actually pretty good,  I just got done looking @ your deviant art page. You seem to have a lot of potential, all you need to work on now is not being such a ass hole. Although it says you are only 16 so I guess its just an age thing.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is that in responce to the picture I posted? Photorealistic = technically sound, the reason I used that piece was to display my technical understanding not to show my “non-boring” contextual work. I mean seriously Guy this is a portrait of my parents how exciting can something like that really be. Plus I’m pretty sure that his teacher want to see that he can be technically all there and not how creative he is.</p>

            <p>So yeah I’m (maybe) going to take a 3D animation and image synthesis course in Cegep (something we have here between high-school and university), but to be admitted I have to pass a selection exam on drawing.</p>
<p>I was sent an e-mail telling me that I was convened, and that the exam would test “if I am able to reproduce a character, represent a scene and a character and to verify my comprehension or perception of spaces and volumes”.</p>
<p>I need tips and advices on how to practice those. Thank you.</p>
