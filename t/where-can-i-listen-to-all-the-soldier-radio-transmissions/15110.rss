    <title>Where can I listen to all the soldier radio transmissions?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/where-can-i-listen-to-all-the-soldier-radio-transmissions/15110</link>
    <description>Title.

Just played through the game again on steam after being nostalgic for it. Was a lot of fun. Felt like there were entirely new sections of the chapter Surface Tension but then I can&#39;t be sure if I had just forgotten it since the last time I played must have been years ago.

Anyway, there were a lot of cool communications on the radios between the soldiers, but I missed a lot of it and was wondering if anyone know where I could listen to them. Unfortunately, googling it just game lots of different results that are not what I am looking for like the soldier voice lines (&quot;Squad! We&#39;ve got Freeman!&quot;, etc.) and stuff like that. Any help would be appreciated. I want to know the soldiers&#39; stories. I kind of love/hate them. I love &#39;em just because I love humans/soldiers and want to see the aliens lose, but I hate them because they&#39;re being a bunch of asses killing the Black Mesa personnel! Maybe we wouldn&#39;t have lost the Seven Hour War if whatever idiots in charge hadn&#39;t decided that working together with the Black Mesa security teams and scientists was a bad idea.</description>

<p>If you want to find basically all of the radio transmissions, you can download <a href="https://nemesis.thewavelength.net/?p=26" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">GCFScape</a> and when it is downloaded, go to Drive:\Program FIles(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bms and you should be able to see a lot of accessible vpk files.<br>
Find ‘bms_sound_vo_english_dir.vpk’ and open it with GCFScape. You should get a screen that allows you to browse all the npc lines that are in each NPC and scripted voice sequences in maps.<br>
If you want to save those voice lines so you can hear them without all this hassle, rightclick on a folder in GCFScape, click ‘Extract’ and choose a destination.</p>
<p>You’re done, and now you can listen to the HECU!</p>

<p>Yes, but use <a href="https://www.riintouge.com/VIDE/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">VIDE</a> instead.</p>
