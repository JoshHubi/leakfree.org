    <title>Morrowind Mods Reccomendations</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/morrowind-mods-reccomendations/6417</link>
    <description>I recently realized what I view as a severe lack in my gaming repertoire.  Namely, I haven&#39;t played The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind.  So I got it, and now started looking for mods.

Sounds nice enough, however there are such a confusingly large amount of mods out there, it&#39;s really hard to find the best ones without spending hours trying them out and decided to look for potential experience with them here.

Basically, recommend your favorite mods for TES: Morrowind.  Any category goes (e.g. texture, models, gameplay etc.)</description>
