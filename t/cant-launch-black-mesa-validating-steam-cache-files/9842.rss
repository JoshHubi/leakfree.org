    <title>Cant launch Black Mesa - validating Steam cache files</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-launch-black-mesa-validating-steam-cache-files/9842</link>
    <description>Hello, Ok this is the thing i was playing BM for some hours and then my Pc crashed, but not beacuse of the game, was cause of the hard drive that got disconected somehow, i had to move some cables to make the hdd works again but after turned on the pc and launching BM on steam, it says validating cache files and then says sorry we cant handle your request at this time, try later.

So what happened, Bm files got screwed or something? i tried with my other games and they launch and work fine. Do i have to reinstall it or it has a simplier solution?</description>

            <p>Oh that was the release day, and i quickly solved it, what i did was reinstall the Mod and validate-redownloaded some corrupted cache Sdk files. But thanks.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Switch steam into offline mode and then back into online mode, then try forcing game cache check on Source Base 2007 SDK. In case it fails with the same “cant do it now” message - try removing Source Base 2007 SDK and then downloading/installing it back once again.</p>
<p>P.S. I really hope you had done filesystem integrity check for all the drives installed in the system after resolving HDD misconnection issue. Failing to do so would left you in a state when you could lost all the files on your harddrives due to filesystem corruption in a near future.</p>

            <p>Have you tried un-and re-installing the Source SDK Base 2007?  That should fix it, I think.</p>

<p>I have this same problem.  A crash didn’t occur in my case.  Instead I stopped playing the game to go get some dinner one night and I came back and it wouldn’t launch.  The game will not launch.  I reinstalled and that didn’t fix anything.  I tried all the workarounds people have on the internet to fix the steam cache download but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>I seriously need help so if someone knows how to fix this then please share with the rest.  Thanks.</p>
