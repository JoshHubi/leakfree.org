    <title>Black Mesa: Gasworks</title>

    <description>Since screenshots take too much time to setup, and I&#39;ve already created the video of the content might as well just link to the video.

[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S9MVJhuEa0&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLtF-Xut-w0PfNyVtnVZyeH18GbQgpQMoN&#39;]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S9MVJhuEa0&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLtF-Xut-w0PfNyVtnVZyeH18GbQgpQMoN[/url]

note: There are no weapons in their rightful place due to me recording in Half-Life 2 Episode 2...

This is the 3rd map I&#39;ve recreated from scratch using reference images on the site and my own knowledge of the Half-Life series. Some features in these maps from the original Half-Life are hard to let go as it seem to have done in the actual mod. So I&#39;m kinda going against the theme the Black Mesa Dev team set in the first place. Even though the chances of these ever being official maps are slim to none, I do the work just to keep the community members that need that extra piece of motivation or just for fun. 

Lambda_bunker is 100% complete and I&#39;d like to say gasworks is too, but it needs a few more fixes and model/texture changes. Crossfire is about complete but could use a hell of a lot of optimizing; and I need the time to compile it. 

The two videos: Crossfire; Lambda_Bunker 
(please note Lambda_Bunker is a 100% remake not a recompiled version of the in-game map c3a1. I wanted to clarify because I worked hard to establish my own hard work into it; I used in-game reference to design the whole level.)

hint: Since I did a revamp/overhaul of the crossfire project this video is severely outdated, but at least you get the whole idea of it.

EDIT: Lambda_bunker might be considered as a SPOILER! View at your own risk.

Thanks for the support, and have fun.</description>

            <p>Thanks, I’m working on a few more changes to gasworks, and a new map called dm_office. Dm_office was a map from the PS2 and Dreamcast (no-retail) copy of Half-Life. This was another easy map to create due to it being a part from the Half-Life Campaign. I’ll either make a new post about that map, or edit this one for the details.</p>
