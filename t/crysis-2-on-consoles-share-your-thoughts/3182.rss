</aside>
<p>That’s all pretty fair. I don’t think PC gamers will run this risk with Crysis 2, as the 360 and PS3 varients will probably be treated more like ports and, therefore, the console owners probably be at a higher risk. That said, the fact that costs and time must go towards all three plaforms does make me wonder how much we’ll miss out on if this game was one platform exclusive.</p>
<p>When developers do things like remove dedicated servers, that’s when you lose faith. It’s a shame that the PC platform is becoming less well supported, given that it’s the platform which used to make the majority of major steps forward and still has far more capabilities than a console. Developers and publishers just don’t put the effort in because the install base is so much lower than consoles.</p>

<p>I try to do the same. I originally bought my PC when I was 13. It’s 7 years on now and entirely different, but I haven’t yet had to buy a new system. I just upgraded it bit by bit, occassionally upgrading several parts at the same time.</p>
<p>I was just wondering if he had any good links, because I ususually spend at least £400 (over $600) just upgrading my graphics, CPU, motherboard and RAM. Now, I don’t do a lot of overclocking, but I don’t buy the very top of the range components either.</p>

<p>Also, parts for PC are cheaper than buying a whole new console(most of the time) and nearly everyone has a PC, so rather than spending £300 on a simple one, spend £500 on a better one for gaming. Basically meaning the whole gaming part is only £200.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not so sure about that, maintaining a high-end gaming machine can be very expensive. People who have the money usually buy a completely new PC every two years to keep it balanced and minimize bottlenecks. I usually pick a very expensive motherboard that I can use to upgrade other parts of the PC (new or multiple GPU(s), new CPU or more RAM) and making sure it has good overclocking support.</p>
<p>The life expectancy of a GPU is usually the lowest (saying this purely out of personal experience) - I no longer use multiple GPU’s because they generate too much heat (my 9800GX2 died after 6 months of use).<br>
Water cooling is not an option for me because money is an issue.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, when looking at a PC that can play Crysis 2 better than a console, then £500 wouldn’t be enough.</p>
<p>Then look at lifespan - a gaming PC which is 3 years old is in need of an upgrade, where as most consoles have been working to at least a 5 year life cycle, meaning you could play each and every game in that period to the standard that was expected. Not to mention that the 360 and PS3 are currently expected to have a life cycle longer than 5 years, and I’ll probably be onto my third PC upgrade at that point.</p>
<p>Then think of the cost - £250 for a PS3 at the moment. A gaming PC which can play at the same sort of graphics (if you were to say, hypothetically, that there was a direct equivalent of something like Uncharted 2 or Killzone 2) would cost at least £600. Then, it two years time, you’ll probably want to upgrade graphics card and maybe add a little extra RAM. You’re probably talking another £150 to £200. By that point, you’re still happy with your PS3 and you’ve still only paid £250 for the hardware alone, where as the PC has now cost you possibly £800 and will probably still rise in another year for a CPU and motherboard, etc.</p>
<p>As for more expensive games on the console, you have a fair point. However, the second hand market is far more popular with console titles. If you’re smart and patient, you could probably keep games to the same cost or less than a new PC title and still get the same product as buying new. That said, some people don’t like to wait.</p>
<p>I would think that, if you’re a hardcore gamer, you’ll probably want to play each PC game to a relatively high standard meaning constant upgrades are a necessity. Therefore, without the need to upgrade a console, it’s a much cheaper option. However, the justification behind the extra cost of a PC is also there - mods, dedicated servers, mouse and keyboard, etc., not to mention that you can use a PC for a lot more than just games. The PS3 is starting to take on some of these traits, but it still has a long way to go.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not in the long term. Games on PC are generally much cheaper than console games, especially when after a while the price goes down alot.</p>
<p>Also, parts for PC are cheaper than buying a whole new console(most of the time) and nearly everyone has a PC, so rather than spending £300 on a simple one, spend £500 on a better one for gaming. Basically meaning the whole gaming part is only £200.</p>

            <p>I think it’s great, I’ll definatley get it for my PS3 if I don’t get a PC upgrade beforehand. I’d be suprisied if any console fags even know what Crysis is, but most probably won’t becasue they are too busy thinking consoles are better than PCs.</p>

<p>JohnKiller, it wasn’t directed at you. You seem quite open minded to both PCs and consoles.</p>

<p>All it becomes is a battle of the insecurities. If you weren’t insecure about it, there’d be no need to argue.</p>

            <p>Well… while they battle it out with an arguement that will never end (somewhat like every other internet forum arguement that happens), back to topic:</p>
<p>I think it’s likely that Crysis two will look better than the first on the PC. I also think that, although it won’t be as good, the console varients will still look really nice.</p>
<p>Just look at Killzone 2 or Uncharted 2. They’re not as good as Crysis, but they’re undeniably good looking games anyway. The consoles can look good. Obviously, the PS3 has more power and can be tricky to progamme for from what I’ve heard, but the 360 could still be optimised enough.</p>
<p>After that, if they improve the gameplay and perfect the special abilities, I think Crysis 2 would still be a great game on any platform. I liked the first, despite it’s flaws, and am looking forward to the second.</p>
<p>Some people can’t afford to get a high spec PC and keep it upgraded, so a consoles is a good choice. The bonus of spending more on the PC is that you get mods, keyboard and mouse, better graphics, etc.</p>
<p>The key point is that Crytek do not need to go much further with graphics, as the first is still a very pretty game. All they have to do is improve little things, make the gameplay better and then work on porting it across to the consoles. This means the PC won’t lose out and, for all those who do love the PC and will play it on that platform, why does it matter if the consoles receive a bad port or not. For the sake of console owners, I hope they don’t, as it would be really nice if everyone could have a chance to play this game at decent graphics.</p>
<p>P.S. If “consolefags” bother you so much when they post on forums about how they’re so much better, do what I do - STOP READING! Lol</p>
