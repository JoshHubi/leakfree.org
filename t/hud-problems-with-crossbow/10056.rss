    <title>Hud problems with Crossbow</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hud-problems-with-crossbow/10056</link>
    <description>When I first got the crossbow I quickly discovered that if I &quot;Quick Save&quot; while I have the crossbow equipped part of my HUD would disappear, health and ammo icon and more importantly the crosshair. The HUD would stay gone forever even if I switched weapons. I have also discovered that if i type &quot;float 1&quot; into the console it will fix it but that just gets annoying to do.</description>
