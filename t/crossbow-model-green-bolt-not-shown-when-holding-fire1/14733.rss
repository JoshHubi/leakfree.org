    <title>[Crossbow model] Green bolt not shown when holding fire1</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crossbow-model-green-bolt-not-shown-when-holding-fire1/14733</link>
    <description>If you hold mouse1 and keep firing, the green bolt doesn&#39;t spawn in the crossbow before the projectile is shot.
So it looks like Gordon is firing nothing but a projectile spawns.

Maybe add the green bolt a little bit before the reload animation for each shot finishes.</description>
