            <p>I am not entirely sure where the problem happened, but perhaps you can double check your instalation process by reviewing it here:<br>

<p>Meanwhile, did you install to your C drive or to a different drive? If I remember correctly, installing to a different drive can cause problems.</p>

            <p>On my first playthrough I got stuck here. I had no idea what to do. I loaded a previous save and let the tram smash through, jumping off before it did. I then jumped to the other side. I didn’t know you had to use the red barrels.</p>
<p>I didn’t fight the big fish. I jumped to a barnacle near the door and while shooting the barnacle I pressed the forward key. I then landed on the broken walkway by the door.</p>

            <p>You can try crouch jumping it. <span class="bbcode-b">Or </span>if memory serves me right (it may not, so save before you try this) there should be a door under water which you can open if you’d like, but you’ll have to take a chance with the Icthy’s if you do. It’s right below the platform you’re standing on, in the wall to the left of the screen. The door requires you to hold E on it to open though, so if you leave the Icthy’s alive it’s risky.</p>

            <p>I seem to be a late-comer to this specific thread. My problem develops latter on when I need to jump through a gate with 3 live wires dangling. (see save below). I’ve looked at two great walkthroughs of chapter ‘Apprehension’ on YouTube and both show running and jumping to get past the wires, some damage is taken, but the player falls into the water and continues.</p>
<p>When I try to jump, I get electrocuted, knocked back, and killed. Somewhere I needed to kill the power, but where? Or do I need to do a special jump?</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/f/0/f00c9970d155d691e6f30f41ff17134e88ad2b0b.jpeg" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/f00c9970d155d691e6f30f41ff17134e88ad2b0b" title=""><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/f/0/f00c9970d155d691e6f30f41ff17134e88ad2b0b.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="yfzAoeCMxsWR4YKchYectymBXsv" width="690" height="388" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/f/0/f00c9970d155d691e6f30f41ff17134e88ad2b0b_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1024×576 61.9 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>ps_ after rifling through a number of YouTube video walkthroughts of chapter ‘Apprehension’, I finally found one that shows the true opening to jump through. I’m not sure why others can jump past the wires? Anyway I’m past now…thanks.</p>

            <p>After putting the barrels under the broken bridge, I only managed to do the jump from the fence. First jump on the fence, move carefully and sprint jump to the other side. Rather annoying part indeed…</p>

            <p>You could have just temporarily enabled always run. I can imagine sprint-crouch-jumping being a bit tricky to time right.</p>

            <p>raised the ramp with no problem but I simply cannot sprint-jump, crouch-jump, or sprint-crouch-jump my way across. Struggling to get the dev console to work so I can tweak the gravity!<br>
Finally! after hunting around for 4 pallets I managed to make a bridge and walk across - TFFT</p>

            <p>Yeah in general, if you don’t know what to do, there are usually subtle indicators that are meant to catch your attention, such as flickering lights, sparks, bubbles, subtle differences in color or contrast, and so on.</p>

<p>Had the same problem, was just about to noclip when i realized the bridge was ALREADY UP. The barrels raise it but not very high… I didn’t even notice that they made a difference at first, until I made a successful crouch-jump to the other side.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>i thought that happened in my case too<br>
but i stayed under water and watched the bridge after i stuffed each and every barrel<br>
all four barrels …one by one<br>
bridge never moved an inch<br>
some one  has a “you tube” video posted with a walkthru of this level<br>
when you see him add the last barrel you can see the bridge move up noticeably…even makes a splashing sound</p>
<p>i hate to cheat but it was either NOCLIP my way across or die of old age<br>
playing “Carry the Barrel”</p>
<p>Ever Onward Regards</p>

<p>Interestingly i found 4 red floats/barrels …placed them under the submerged bridge and the bridge never rose up<br>
at one point i had something like 8-9 floats all stuffed under the bridge<br>
i even tried repositioning the floats…put some in the front of the bridge…some towards the back<br>
Bridge never budged an inch<br>
it must be a bug/glitch<br>
i had to NO CLIP my way to the ramp</p>

<p>Had the same problem, was just about to noclip when i realized the bridge was ALREADY UP. The barrels raise it but not very high… I didn’t even notice that they made a difference at first, until I made a successful crouch-jump to the other side.</p>

<p>Thanks. I’d already worked out how to make it rise by putting the barrels underneath, that was obvious. It was the crouch jumping thing that got me, and I’d convinced myself that I was overlooking something. Did it eventually.</p>
<p>I’m absolutely dreading Residual Processing - always my most hated level as I hate first person jumping puzzles. An entire level full of tricky jumps, which will probably involve a load of crouch jumping in Black Mesa… Joy joy joy  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Try to find more red floats like the ones that are already below that submerged bridge. They are in the surroundings. Put all them below the bridge and it will emerge.</p>
<p>After that you need to duck-jump to the other side.</p>

<p>I’m stuck in this same area, except that I’m on the other side of the large wall on the left side of this screenshot where there’s a tunnel underwater that’s blocked by a military vehicle.  What am I overlooking?</p>

<p>The fuck, I made it on the first try.<br>
I stood to the Right of the hole in the fence (on a very small pathwalk). And made a simple jump and made it through.</p>

<p>Actually you need to jump through the role in the fence at the right side of the eletric wire.<br>
Stay on the edge of the slippy walkway and try to crouch-jump. It is a bit tricky.</p>
