    <title>Creative Commons - Music and ND</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/creative-commons-music-and-nd/2933</link>
    <description>What I hate about CC is the fact that most music tracks are tagged by ND (No Derived Work), because besides the fact, that you aren&#39;t allowed to make any modifications, this also denies the use of it as background music in videos, custom maps or other work.

My question is, whether someone knows any websites that provide CC (or completely free) music, without that restriction (tracks with the Sampling-License for example)

Thanks!</description>
