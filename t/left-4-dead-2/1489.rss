    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/left-4-dead-2/1489</link>
    <description>So what do you all think? i thought the first one was good, but theres something about it, the graphics look poor, game play felt cheap, and the thing is, its built on the source engine? so why not the type of feel as half life 2? i know properties can be changed but, i just want your views on it.

cheers :retard:</description>

<p>I actually liked it as a change.</p>
<p>It just goes to show that fucked up stuff still goes on while it’s a perfect day outside, as opposed to zombie apocalypses only going on during night and with terrible story weather.</p>

</aside>
<p>Agreed. I think the only thing really lost is the feeling of horror but the game was never really scary to begin with, just face paced and somewhat startling so I don’t really mind the change.</p>
<p>If anything I think it’s an improvement since the game jumps out more as being a unique twist on the zombie survival genre and not just a bunch of cliche’s thrown together into a co-op survival game. A well done co-op survival game, but still.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, I can see what you’re saying there.  It does feel a little more happy over all(lighting, textures, characters) but that doesn’t really bother me.  Underlying the whole game is amazing gameplay and that’s really the most important thing, even if it feels gimmicky.<br>
Now, I’m saying this having not played L4D in…  Months at the least so I can’t really judge effectively, maybe I’ll try L4D again and see if it feels a lot less gimmicky and happy.</p>

            <p>The environment/models felt TF2-ey at times.  Coach just looked like the cartooniest thing in the world…  I’m not saying it looked exactly like TF2 does, but all the survivors felt… TOO vibrant.  I understand they had to make them stand out above the hordes of zombies, but making them look fake (as opposed to the REAL-looking zombies [lol…]), just didn’t seem to do it for me.</p>
<p>Hard Rain:  favorite level.  but the starting area (while it’s still not raining) just felt fake.  Coming back and through the shitstorm it was awesome.  Maybe it’s just the lighting that I found off…</p>

</aside>
<p>The original was a lot more simplistic, whether that’s good or bad depends on how you look at it. It was also much darker, much more atmospheric. The game felt more “Everyone is dead or infected, society’s collapsed, and the government has given up on us! We gotta get the hell out of here…” and less “Hell yeah, lets go kill zombies and play carnival games!”.</p>

I own the game and I can vouch that it didn’t need to be an expansion, it is very well designed and though the lighting does bring out some small flaws here and there, unless you’re trying to shoot machinima in it or something(which I very highly doubt in L4D2) then it’s fine, and even if that was the case it still wouldn’t mean much.<br>
The kind of flaws I’m talking about are very minuscule like walls looking unnatural, and I’m pretty sure I remember that kind of thing in L4D anyway.<br>
So if you’re thinking “I’ll wait till it drops in price”, I’ve got no problem with that. I wanted to as well but I didn’t see any deals for a few weeks so my patience wore out, but if you aren’t going to get the game because it came out so fast, definitely get it, its worth it by a long shot.<br>
