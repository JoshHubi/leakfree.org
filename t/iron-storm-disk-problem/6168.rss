    <title>Iron Storm disk problem.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/iron-storm-disk-problem/6168</link>
    <description>I finally took my dusty IS disks down to install and play them again. Unfortunetly, something is damaged. The disk itself is perfectly sound, no scratches to speak of, but it doesn&#39;t recognize the second disk. It asks for it, but when you place it inside the tray and close it, it just says that it needs disk two again.

Also, it said something about a registration file, and it couldn&#39;t locate a .bmp file I believe. It asked if I could find it and I did, but I can&#39;t open it. Any ideas on how to fix it? Or should I buy the disks again?</description>

<p>Isn’t it like creating a backup copy of your disc? Or asking someone to create a backup copy of your disc for you… it’s the same data  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  If you download a crack to pirate the software, that’s another story.</p>

            <p>I just did. Now I cannot change the settings. The game crashes. And I don’t know about you guys, but using the keyboard to play this game is no enjoyable task. Most of the controls are spread around the entire keyboard. If I can’t fix it, thats cool. I might find a new download.</p>

            <p>… Download it? No shame in downloading a torrent if you own the original disk… no shame and nothing illegal about it, either.</p>
