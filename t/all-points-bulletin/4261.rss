    <description>For those who don&#39;t know hat it is, it&#39;s a new game coming out that is an MMO version of GTA with more shooter elements and amazing character customization. Unfortunately there is a subscription fee. Worth it or not?

Here is a video: [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGuR8SO9xk&#39;]APB trailer[/url]

I personally am going to buy it mainly for the social aspect; me and several of my friends are going to buy it and we will all play together. one nice thing about the subscription fee is that when you first buy the game it comes with about 50 hours of gameplay before you have to pay more. And after that it is 7 dollars for every 20 hours of gameply.</description>

            <p>I’m going to have to try something other than the semi auto rifles because, like Rot said, the recoil is just too much to make them very effective.</p>
<p>Also, I’m a Criminal on NA2, my name’s Fwong and I was completely unaware until about an hour in that my character looks like a half-Asian Billy Mays.</p>

            <p>Apparently they extended the KttC event another 5 hours. What faction are you on, (rot)(fodder?</p>
<p>Also, garthbartin, It took me a while to get used to the aiming, but I adapted and while I do still have some issues it’s mostly fine. I don’t know, it might just be your computer or something, because I know I stutter a lot in battle.</p>

            <p>I agree with (rot)(fodder, I think the 5 hours isn’t really enough to enjoy it. Though I was in the EU beta, and I played that quite a bit, so it isn’t a huge issue for me. Looking forward to the head start, because KttC characters don’t carry over.</p>
<p>I also find it funny that after three hours of play I have over 25k, where it took me like a day to get that much in the EU beta. I suppose it’s just because everyone is new to the game, at this moment. Open beta and all that.</p>
<p>Also, the SMG beats out pretty much anything within 40 metres of you. Except for a car, but that’s what grenades are for.</p>

            <p>I’ve been playing it, and sadly, I can’t stand it. It’s awful. I don’t think it’s really the game’s fault, probably my internet’s, but every time I get in a fire fight it glitches out and my aiming lags really really badly, it makes the game unplayable. I’m not sure I’l pre-order it unless I know this glitch is fixed.</p>

            <p>well, I gotta say, I’m impressed. It’s like the good parts of counterstrike thrown into unreal tournament with a massive play area. I am definatly not dissapointed about pre-ordering.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint is that I feel compelled to hurry missions due to the fact that we only got 5 hours (+ five more for me and some other people though now. :awesome <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  in this event. Once I’m not hurrying around trying to make as much money as possible for the social district, I can’t really think of a complaint at this time.</p>

            <p>I don’t think player width affects the hitbox at all, and you won’t notice anyways.</p>
<p>if your playing a midget and height affects hixbox radius, well, your also going to have to live with being a midget. Personally, I’d rather die a few more times instead of have to jump to over barricades to shoot.</p>

            <p>I’m kinda torn on one part of the game though: the hitbox. I heard that the people are just one big hitbox. Good thing: It should keep the game fair and to try to discourage overskilled 10 year old CoD fanatics. Bad thing: The game might become overpopulated by anorexic midgets because people will inevitably choose to have a smaller hitbox over the creativity and good-looking characters.</p>

<p>IIRC right now you can only interact with a select group of online players. So if you’re part of a group of 5 criminals, there is supposed to be a group of 5 enforcers as your online opponents.  That means 10 people can interact with one another and all of the other 90 players in the map are ghosted and non interactive, but still causing there own mayhem and perhaps apart of the same “battles.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately there doesnt appear to be enough interactive npc civilians, a la GTA, but I could be wrong.  What else can you do in the world besides attack your designated online opponents?</p>

<p>I don’t know, I’ve read that it’s possible to screw with other people’s missions. I do hope you can, I’ll be a bit disappointed if you can’t.</p>

            <p>I have been in the beta since march and the only thing i don’t like is that most of the mission are the same, and its going to have both tha abillity to pay for hours and pay for an month of unlimited game-time.<br>
oh and the good thing is that u get unlimited time in the social district so you dont waste youre playtime on customization</p>

            <p>IIRC you have to go find your own missions, unless your a cop, in which case you will get an all points bulletin when a criminal in your area does something criminalish. It sounds like the enforcers can also do other missions, but they have to go find those themselves.</p>
<p>Also, the action districts are huge, (it sounds like) so there will be plenty of exploring and if you felt so inclined, you <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">could</span></span> interfere with car chases and vehicle barricades and stuff. also, you ONLY have designated opponents when doing a mission. so two different missions will likely have you fighting different people.</p>
<p>after a mission is over, it is back to free roaming, or criminalizing, or what ever you feel like.</p>

            <p>I believe there are three separate areas, two for missions with designated opponents and the other being a no-fire zone for customization and social networking.  I don’t think you can run around the map and screw with random online players, ruining their missions; you can only interact with the your assigned opponents.  Also, it appears that missions are automatically assigned to you but I do not know what you do if you can reject a mission, perhaps mess with civilian npcs?</p>

            <p>I think you only have designated opponets for your current mission, once it is complete, you have no more designation until you start another mission.</p>
<p>Pimp out your cars, make designs/clothes/music.</p>
<p>spraypaint your designs on walls, interfere with other peoples’ missions, explore, extreme roleplay (IE creeping people out by pretending to live in the game, ala the <span class="bbcode-b">Toll Troll</span> of Wow.)</p>
