<p>So you don’t do anything and still do more than someone who does something? :facepalm:</p>
<p>Not only that, you meat someone on the Internet who, for <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> time, defended, from a rational point of view, a helpless cause and you conclude that that is the only kind of charity or activism that this person gets involved with. :facepalm:</p>
<p>You should know better than judging people that you don’t even know.</p>
<p>(And before you claim I have judged you in any way, note that all I did was to make a question so I could verify the validity of your criticism.)</p>

<p>I’m still sorta surprised it is still being discussed, both here and everywhere else.  It has every scrap of evidence against it, yet people still believe what they hear.</p>
<p>I’ve yet to figure out if it is just out of some desire to feel like they are saving Africa one facebook post at a time, or if people really are that misinformed and dumb.</p>

            <p>From my point of view, these are the symptoms of underdevelopment, not it’s cause. You can’t blame the people when they go desperate because of their condition, or when they act irrationally and violently for growing up in a hopeless land without proper education and mostly seeing people that simply don’t care about them.</p>

            <p>Africa doesn’t need aid, foreign aid is one of the reasons why they can’t get their shit together. We subsidize our farmers, dump the excesses on the market at artificially low prices putting everyone in Africa out of business. African governments are also a major problem in the ass. Unstable currencies (hyperinflation), corruption, war, no privately owned land (no investment). When the government owns all the land, why bother starting a business, expanding, investing (not that they would allow you to anyway).</p>

            <p>My only point is that money might not be the solution. Aid in the form of man power / services / resources for establishing strong foundations for developing a healthy infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as a note. Most money transferred for aid to Africa isn’t donated. It’s loaned. Africa as a continent pays out 20 billion dollars every year paying back debt. That is significant if you aren’t a wealthy area of the globe. Also lots of the money that goes to African countries is stolen, or embezzled because of corruption. So yeah…outside aid is often totally ineffective. Just putting that out there.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, this is typical of underdeveloped countries. Or, better to say, of all countries, the entire world suffers from corruption. However, there is also legitimate work, and there are people that try to make them to look bad. I say that based on various events that have been happening here in Brazil lately. There is a great disparity between these events as portrayed by mass media (those from open TV channels and the most popular newspapers and magazines) and independent media.</p>
<p>The government of São Paulo State and lots of other influential people connected with it are doing horrible mass oppressions against poor people, university students and also against all kinds of protests that are against them. During the Military Dictatorship, several people were tortured and killed under the excuse that they were communists. They said (and some even say it today!) that they were only protecting the country when they brutally oppressed popular protesters, the mass media covered all the facts, portraying the protesters always as communists, vagabonds that don’t have to work and have nothing better to do then to criticize the government.</p>
<p>That is happening all over again! Today, in Brazil, believe me or not, the entire country “knows” that the student activism is composed by vagabonds, wealthy, spoiled drug addicted students who have never worked in their lives, that don’t study and have nothing better to do than to protest against the truculence of the military police on the university campus because they want to smoke pot. Yes, every single one of the three thousand students in a deliberate assembly that unanimously voted against the permanence of the police at the campus were pot smokers.</p>
<p>The six thousand poor people that were expelled from there homes by the military police with “non-lethal weapons”, they were also all drug addicts that don’t work, they were all criminals because they invaded and made their homes in a piece of land the belonged to one single business man that works with imobiliary speculation. And, of course, the federal policemen with who the military policemen had a gunfight, well, the public simply didn’t hear about that. And the missing people, well, they just “got lost” and “went somewhere” as a result of the mess. There have been several “urban area clean-ups” lately and, yes, they all involve pot smokers, criminals and vagabonds. The military police is authorized to beat and shoot those spoiled pot smokers in the name of public safety and well-fare.</p>
<p>So, excuse me too skeptical about those accusations against people who are (at least allegedly) trying to help other people. Specially if it is something which looks like to have the intention of stopping people from donating to charity or from giving attention to activists. Excuse me if I don’t buy into those “obvious facts”.</p>
<p>Dear me, it’s the Military Dictatorship all over again!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Sorry for the gigantic post, I just had to get it off my chest.</p>

<p>Of course there is. But then the rich people use that to become richer and explore the poor people in the process, making the people to stay poor. That’s how capitalism works, welcome to the real world.</p>

<p>Ugh! You are so dumb! Apparently you can’t read. I didn’t mention anything about African COUNTRIES. I mentioned WESTERN COUNTRIES who happened to be wealthy. I used them as comparatives to the situation in Africa, specifically poorer areas. Like I said $20B IS NOT a lot of money in developed COUNTRIES. But many COUNTRIES in Africa aren’t wealthy. Many exist on an entirely different scale of economics than developed nations. There are of course exceptions that actually have surplus, doesn’t help the poorer countries.</p>
<p>Also, much of what is mined in poorer African countries doesn’t benefit the people in the countries they are mined from.</p>

<p>Actually I did a bunch of research into the problem of embezzled funds to African countries, and it’s well documented if you’d care to actually LOOK IT UP! There is a great deal of political parties, and leaders who have been caught siphoning money that was supposed to aid the country to personal funds.</p>
<p>I’ve pretty much had it with your stupidity, racism, ill informed opinions, and poor grammar. This will be the last post of yours I respond to.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just as a note. Most money transferred for aid to Africa isn’t donated. It’s loaned. Africa as a continent pays out 20 billion dollars every year paying back debt. That is significant if you aren’t a wealthy area of the globe. Also lots of the money that goes to African countries is stolen, or embezzled because of corruption. So yeah…outside aid is often totally ineffective. Just putting that out there.</p>

<p>Gugamilare, organisations like that have to make their income and expenses public every year. The public financial information of Invisible Children clearly states that more than 70% of the money they get, goes to staff and the production of pointless videos (like a bunch of twats dancing on vans). No conspiracy theories, no farfetched reading-between-lines, just hard facts of the public financial report.</p>

<p>All right, I’m glad I hadn’t given any money to that organization yet  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>What I meant is, even if he is crazy, he might be right that Kony needs to be arrested. If you, for instance, learn about Gandhi, you will find out that he was nuts.</p>
