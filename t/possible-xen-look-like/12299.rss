    <title>Possible xen look like?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/possible-xen-look-like/12299</link>
    <description>hi i was wondering if the xen level would look like a part from questionable ethics
when you enter a room thats look from an alien world, xen may be like that?

and i was seeing something, there is no information about xen and no updates nothing since the first release, they are dead like our past 2 years? i dont want to wait 2 years more for the last chapter</description>

            <p>Yes, the QE area is a short preview of Xen’s content. We don’t know what’s going on in the development, and apparently the Steam release on Greenlight is unknown to us as well, allegedly due to an NDA.</p>
<p>If you’d like to discuss stuff about what should be in Xen, I made a rather large thread about it <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12527" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here.</a></p>
