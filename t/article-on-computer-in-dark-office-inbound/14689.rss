    <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, i have been a long time lurker of the wikia. Tried my hand at the hex code and failed miserably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway I decided to play through the game and try and find the clue that was hinted at that we have not found yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not know if anybody picked it up, but the article on the screen found in the fourth office as you ride the tram, just after the security box, where the lights are switched off ( To the left of the monitor &quot;The pizza is a lie&quot; is painted on the wall) can be found here [url]https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/07/no-engine-failure-found-w_0_n_999832.html[/url]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will try and find interesting things and post it. I will try my best not to duplicate things already mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
