    <title>What have you been reading?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-have-you-been-reading/1466</link>
    <description>This thread is for people to discuss short stories, poems, novels, etc that they are either currently reading or have just finished.

Right now I am reading &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; by Terence Prattchet, the first book in the Discworld series. So far it&#39;s pretty good, it has a little comedy in it and I find it somewhat funny. Death is a pretty cool character.

Also, I just finished reading &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, a short story by Arthur C Clarke. I decided to read it because the movie 2001 (one of my favorite movies) is based on it. I always like stories about a higher existence than humans and this story just made my spine tingle.</description>

            <p>Just sort of bringing this thread back up with an inquiry:<br>
Has anyone read the <span class="bbcode-i">Mars</span> trilogy (<span class="bbcode-i">Red Mars</span>, <span class="bbcode-i">Blue Mars</span>, and <span class="bbcode-i">Green Mars</span>) by Kim Stanley Robinson?<br>
I had never really looked into them before but they seem interesting. Plus i feel like ordering something more than just <span class="bbcode-i">Neuromancer</span> now that I’ve actually remembered adding that one to my “to-read”-list.</p>
<p>I’ve recently gotten started on <span class="bbcode-i">Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency</span>, by Douglas Adams, which I have been meaning to pick up for the past two years.<br>
40-some pages into it, and it seems to be a case of “if you like the author you will like the book”.</p>

            <p>I saw the Green Lantern movie recently, which inspired me to go on a Green Lantern binge.  Green Lantern has always been my favorite superhero, but it’s been on backburner for a little while.  So, I picked up Blackest Night, one of the more recent DC Universe comics, which features Hal Jordan in a really prominent role.  It was sweet.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve read a bunch more Pratchett (<span class="bbcode-i">The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents, The Fifth Elephant, The Truth</span>) in my ongoing quest to reread the series in chronological order.  While I was home over the holidays, I visited Powell’s City of Books in Portland, OR and picked up <span class="bbcode-i">I Shall Wear Midnight</span>, one of Pratchett’s more recent novels (I also saw <span class="bbcode-i">Snuff</span> in hardback, and it took a great deal of self-control not to buy it; I don’t buy hardbacks if I can help it); <span class="bbcode-i">Dreadnought</span> by Cherie Priest; <span class="bbcode-i">Tom Swift and His Polar-Ray Dynasphere</span> (which I probably won’t actually read; I have an extensive collection of old Tom Swift hardbacks, which I used to love the hell out of when I was younger, but which I now keep around pretty much exclusively as collectibles); and <span class="bbcode-i">Look to Windward</span> by Iain M. Banks, which I’m reading now.</p>

            <p>Finished The Lost Symbol. I felt that it ended well, if not a little too predictable. Once they were like, “I know why this dude hates your family so much…” it became quite apparent, before they actually came out and said who the main antagonist actually was. What a twist!</p>
<p>Tonight I also finished The One Minute Entrepreur by Ken Blanchard and Don Hutson with Ethan Willis. A book about a guy starting up his own sucessful business, and the best way to get there. It’s a little hokey in the first chapter, but it picks up pace shortly after the second. It has some excellent insight into developing a small business, and is recommended for anyone aspiring to run their own company.</p>

</aside>
<p>Now, I admit, Angels and Demons is the best out of the three, I wouldn’t describe The Lost Symbol as horrible. Da Vinci Code and Lost Symbol are certainly not great books, but they make for an entertaining read, though shallow at best, but not bad.</p>

            <p>The lost symbol is the worst book in the series, and is horrible!</p>
<p>Terry Pratchett is awesome, looking forward to my birthday so I can get Snuff!</p>
<p>Currently reading through the A Song of Fire and Ice series, reading a Clash of Kings.  It’s engaging stuff, my big issue with a Game of Thrones was the fact that while Martin tries to catch the reader out with many little twists and they are all quite predictable, its like he telegraphs them a page or half a page before he ‘springs’ it on you.</p>

            <p>Re-read <span class="bbcode-i">Men At Arms</span> as part of my quest to re-read Discworld in chronological order.  It’s funny, but the first time around, I didn’t realize how GOOD some of these books were.  I mean, they’re all good, but… <span class="bbcode-i">Men at Arms</span> was, like, <span class="bbcode-i">GOOD.</span>  I had remembered it as my least favorite of the Watch books, somehow.</p>

            <p>Not like anyone’s responding to this thread. But I’ve since moved onto Dan Brown’s final chapter with Robert Langden in The Lost Symbol.</p>
<p>Pretty cool Mason conspiracy thriller.</p>

<p>LOL. Half of Brown’s references are based on conjecture anyways.  Like the Priory of Sion as a secret society founded in 1099, is a complete load of bullocks. The society was founded in 1956 by a Frenchman by the name of Pierre Plantard who claimed he was of the Merovingian bloodline. He distributed texts into various notable libraries in France. One such book is known as Les Dossiers Secrets, listing various Priory Grand Masters over the centuries. The society was officially disbanded and pronounced defunct a couple years later by the French government, based on illegal activities, and fraudulant practices. Plantard tried to keep it going on into well past the millennium where he edited his original Grand Master list to include a powerful French politician who was charged with serious allegations after the publication was printed. Because of this, Plantard was called to the witness stand because of the Frenchman’s inclusion on the list, where he publicly announced that all he claimed was fabricated and false.</p>
<p>It’s funny what you can dig up, just by doing a little research.</p>

            <p>Just finished <span class="bbcode-i">Neverwhere</span>.  It took me a while to start, because Neil Gaiman books, while awesome, are usually depressing as hell, but I’m glad I finally read it.  It was awesome.</p>
