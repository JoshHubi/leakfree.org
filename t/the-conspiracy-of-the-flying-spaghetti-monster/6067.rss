            <p>Fancy’s right.  I’m not an atheist based on what I heard from Christianity or Islam.  I’m an atheist based on my research into the religions.  I’ve read the Bible and the Qur’an.  I’m getting through the Bhagavad Gita now.  I know the history of the various religions…which is extremely important for knowing the context of these books.</p>
<p>The idea of the deities and spirits of these religions are completely contradictory and some of the teachings in these so-called holy books are downright offensive.  Because they were written not by some beneficent god character…but by people claiming to speak for God or claiming to be “influenced” by God or claiming that God “talked” to them, with their historical prejudices and scientific knowledge (or lack thereof) of the time.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>I’m an atheist because there’s absolutely ZERO credibility for these deities and absolutely NO evidence for them.  THAT’S why I’m an atheist.  If you don’t like that, tough noogies.</p>

Trust me. An atheist is an atheist, because he only heard shitty chrisitian shit or simply heard nothing about religion at all. You can’t criticize something or even read critics about something before you know what the critic is about. Imagine reading a movie critic and then go to the streat discussing with people about the movie without actually watching the film. These people who watched the movie will clearly see that you have no idea what you are talking about.</p>

<p>i’m an atheist because the idea of god makes no sense. it has no idea with what i’ve ~~~~~~~heard about religion. also, i was raised catholic and went to a catholic school for the first half of my life, so your arguments really hold no water at all j s y k</p>
<p>you’ve got no idea what you’re talking about<br>
people aren’t all atheists for the same reason and blanket statements like that make you look ignorant and downright stupid.</p>

            <p>I’ve heard so many things about religion…probably too much.  I was an atheist before and I’m an atheist now.  <em>shrug</em></p>
<p>I saw a quote on the Internet regarding religion:</p>
<p>Religion is like your penis. It’s okay if you share it with other people who enjoy it, but it’s considered impolite to brag about it, and it’s wrong to wave it around in public, hit people over the head with it, or shove it down the throats of children.</p>
