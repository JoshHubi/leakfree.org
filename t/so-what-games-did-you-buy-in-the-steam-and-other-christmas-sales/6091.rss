    <title>So what games did you buy in the Steam (and other) Christmas sales?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-what-games-did-you-buy-in-the-steam-and-other-christmas-sales/6091</link>
    <description>In previous years, I&#39;ve gone on oblivious to the awesome deals on offer every Christmas (and other holiday times) on Steam (and other digital distribution services), but not any longer! Even though I&#39;m currently on holiday, I braved the dodgy Chinese internet I&#39;m using to cash in on some of the deals.

So far I&#39;ve bought Batman: Arkham Asylum, the first three Splinter Cell games and two Monkey Island games for about $20. I&#39;m planning to pick up Torchlight and The Adventures of P.B. Winterbottom, currently $5 and $0.50 respectively, before the end of the sales. I&#39;m also hoping that Bad Company 2 re-emerges by the end of the period, because its not available for sale in China  :frowning: .

Given that there are [i]so[/i] many awesome deals going around, what has everyone else picked up? Or is hoping to pick up?</description>

            <p>Right… so in my somewhat addicted trance of “might as well by as many games as I can, given the prices”, I went all out this year to try to fill my ongoing back catalogue of games I should own or want to try:<br>
Starwars Battlefront II<br>
Lucasarts Jedi Knight Bundle<br>
Supreme Commander 2<br>
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. CoP + SoC<br>
Hitman Collection<br>
Brothers in Arms Pack<br>
Serious Sam Gold Pack (ROW)<br>
Mirror’s Edge<br>
FlatOut Ultimate Carnage (ROW)<br>
FlatOut2<br>
FlatOut<br>
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition (ROW)<br>
Battlefield Bad Company 2 Standard Edition<br>
Battlefield Bad Company 2 Specact DLC<br>
Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam<br>
OddBoxx<br>
Killing Floor PostMortem Character Pack 2 DLC<br>
Killing Floor - “London’s Finest” DLC Character pack<br>
Infernal<br>
The Deus Ex Collection<br>
Super Meat Boy</p>
<p>I was also gifted these two games by a friend on Steam as they were in my wishlist:<br>
Red Faction Guerrilla<br>
Deathspank TOV</p>

<p>I know, but I was in China both times. Where you can’t buy it. So I was hoping that it would come back for the last day, but no dice.</p>

<p>On the massive up side, I managed to get my girlfriend hooked on Broken Sword. And two of the games even run on her Mac. Its shit like this Steam. Shit like this.</p>

            <p>I heard a lot of good about Spore, but the truth is slightly different, poor poor graphics, boring repetitive gameplay (one playthrough and it’s over, and it doesn’t take long)<br>
The Ideas are all really awesome, but they didn’t get the game right :’( But enough about that, I’m sure many people found it to be very good ^^<br>
I really want Mafia II, but my damned Paypal account has run out of money.</p>
<p>Edit : I would def. recommend the stalker bundle, the whole series was incredible, and you’ll get many hours of gameplay out of it.</p>

            <p>The Deus Ex Collection<br>
Super Meat Boy<br>
Amnesia: The Dark Descent<br>
Half-Life: Blue Shift<br>
Half-Life: Opposing Force</p>
<p>I’m a poor bastard so I only bought stuff if it was 5 bucks or less. Speaking of that, what would someone suggest I buy out of the following (I can only get one): Killing Floor, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Bundle, or Plants vs. Zombies? I’m leaning toward the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Bundle, just because that’s technically the best savings overall.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wait, what the hell. I could’ve sworn the Killing Floor Bundle was $4.99 earlier… now that’s standalone version.</p>
