    <description>Ok, so has the development team of BM taken some of the gameplay/story aspects from the expansions to enhance the experience of playing through BM? I think that it would be a good solution to make a better game.
I don&#39;t know wether the expansions are canon or not, but really it doesn&#39;t matter, just use what you think would be awesome.  For example the male black ops, or the nuke (which has been confirmed by a valve developer to have actually happened in game btw).  Just because in Half Life, the black ops (bo) were seriousely underdeveloped, there was a statement by Mark Laidlaw that said since blackops are not a gearbox creation , but an opportunistic use of existing real-life elements.  It would be interesting to glimpse at a hint at what could have happened at black mesa, even in one of the gmans &quot;flash backs&quot;.  As always, to enhance the experience.</description>

            <p>The reason they even made male black ops was because in OP4 you couldn’t fight the other soldiers, male Black Ops were just replacement soldiers. There’s no reason to put them in BM.</p>

            <p>I just saw an image of BM’s credits.</p>
<p>Camera sitting on the floor of the cracked desert. Heat distortion everywhere with the Black Mesa’s above ground buildings visible in the distance. About half way through the music track (probably after all the names have rolled down), a huge white flash fills up the whole screen before a shockwave hits the camera and cracks it (probably kicks up some pebbles toward the camera too). The rest of the credits (overflowing music track) is the resulting debris slowly clearing up to reveal a crater.</p>
<p>It will not happen. I’d love it, but it won’t happen.</p>

            <p>OBM looks awesome, I hope one day I may be able to play bm and obm back to back, which is why I hope for more compatibility, but as long as its not something major, It doesn’t really matter, anyway, maybe a mod could be made that make them fit into eachother more.<br>
About operation black mesa, does anyone know how far they are from completion, I have absolutely no idea of what point they are approximately, one of the more recent media releases said they had just finished making the weapon models.  That doesn’t look like a good sign, but Im not the one to judge.  Though it helps that OP was shorter, being an expansion.</p>

<p>It´s because most of them are already adults and adults have to be always realistic…they´va alreday kicked me out with the idea of Shepperds´ appearance in HL3 …they don´t have imagination…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But I also think male BlackOps in BM are not good idea…devs want to keep the storyline and gameplay as much same as the original HL…and it still won´t make any sense adding them, because where do you want to add them? there are only 2 areas with cca 4 BO assassins ( cca 9 in whole game )…and yeah, I know, there are no female scientists in HL1, but what about Gina ? ( that holographic assistant in hazard course )…she´s a woman scientist, so basically there are some female scientists in BM facility …  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Everyone is entitled to waste their own time if they so choose, anyway everyone on these forums is wasting their time, as nothing they say really affects mod development.<br>
Again, if it bothers you so much, don’t pay attention to it.</p>
<p>These scenarios could be implemented in a mod after bm is released, that I plan on making.</p>
<p>Why does everyone have to attack each other in these forums, I’ve seen alot of it here, not just to me.</p>

<p>In HL the player didn’t know about the nuke and had to deal with other things like accept Gman offer or not. Adding a flashback for an event placed in the future and not story related is useless.</p>

            <p>There is literally NO REASON to discuss how male black ops could be added to BM when you know they won’t be, everything you say in this thread will have 0 effect on the mod, and you’re wasting your time thinking about it, go annoy people on the Operation Black Mesa forums (Do they have forums?) about male black ops if you want them so badly.</p>

            <p>The reason I created this topic was for discussion, we know that it wont be implemented, I am just talking about the ways in which it could.  The topic is meant for people who actually want to talk about this, there is no need for argument, nobody wants that.</p>
<p>Stop intuding in this discussion, telling people not to discuss.  That is the whole point of this, if you don’t like it, no one is forcing you to even pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Just go away if you have nothing to contribute.</p>

            <p>By the time that you encounter the black ops in OP4 gordon is already in/near the lambda complex, the nuke itself is located at the same area as the first black ops in OP4 (it’s the cone shaped thing in the truck). There is no way you would encounter the nuke, no matter how you try to work it in.</p>

            <p>The last chapter in half life occurs at  around the same time that the chapters in op, so it wouldn’t be in the future, plus gman does do future flashbacks.  You should read my previous post, I meant like showing a view of black mesa with a mushroom cloud or something, while gman is giving his final speech.</p>
