    <title>A Few Questions About Black Mesa !</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-few-questions-about-black-mesa/13152</link>
    <description>Hey Everyone ! , I&#39;m new on the forums ... i&#39;ve downloaded BM a few days ago and i played around for a bit ... and i have to say that YOU GUYS ROCK ! , THIS MOD IS JUST AWESOME ! ... But i have a few questions ...

Before I Begin :

-i apologize in advance if any of the questions below have been answered somewhere els

-i&#39;m kind of new to first person shooters (AKA all i&#39;ve played so far is Wolfenstein 3D , DOOM ,  DUKE3D &amp; HL1)

-Please ignore  any spelling mistakes as english isn&#39;t my native language

-To make things easier for everyone , Don&#39;t use quotes ... instead use the number / number + letter in front of the question ...

-keep in mind that i&#39;ve also played the original Half-Life (NOT THE SOURCE VERSION) So some questions will be related to that ...

now let&#39;s start

1.a.) i&#39;ve noticed that the load times are like real huge on my end ... like 40 seconds or so ... is there any way to speed these up a bit ?

1.b.) speaking of load times , in the original half-life the music would still play even during loading screens ... is there a way to make that happen in BM or is it impossible do to source engine limitations ?

2.a.) Is it just me ? or you can&#39;t jump as high as you would in HL1 ? ... i don&#39;t mean like crouch jumping and stuff i mean like ... basic jumping ... in HL1 you would jump a bit higher then you do in BM ... not like it really matters but ... still ... is there a way to make it the same as in HL1 ?

2.b.) No BHOP ? ... really ? ... why not ? ... how can i get that ?

3.a.) i&#39;ve noticed that in BM enemies take more shots to kill ... specificly when it comes to body shots ... like leg shots and stuff ... is there a way to make that like it originally was in HL1 ?

3.b.) in the BM options menu there is an option for &quot;iron sights&quot; is there a way to bind that to a key or something ? (so that i can still keep my altfire) ?

4.) i&#39;m not the kind of technical dude ... and i&#39;m kind of new to FPS games ...  and i don&#39;t get what most of the options in the BM tab are for ... can someone explain what each one does in game ?

5.) is there a way to run BM in offline mode or even without steam ? ... i don&#39;t get this ... as of right now BM is single player only so why the hell does it even need an internet connection ? (i mean ... i&#39;m usually connected all the time but ...) ?

6.) is there really no way to get DirectX 10 Going on ? No injectors ? no nothing ?

7.) when i start a new game my previously unlocked chapters are still there ... how can i reset those back to just the first chapter ?

Any replies are highly appreciated ...

&quot;Thank You , And Have A Very Safe , And Productive Day&quot;  :smiley:</description>

            <p>1b- to add to this, the BM devs looked into this heavily and did find a solution at one point but found that it caused problems elsewhere in the game so they had to scrap it.</p>

<p>6 - The version of the engine used by the mod is directx 9 only. Why do you want Directx 10 anyway? It was trash. If anything you’d want DX11.<br>
7 - How is this a problem?</p>

</aside>
<p>6 - DX11 would be nice but i only have a DX10 capable GPU  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  … i tought it would hve some more optimisations and maybe it would of made BM ever better or something … but maybe it’s just crap … who knows … actually i don’t know if my laptop supports DX11 … but even if it would … if SRC has no way of running it … then …</p>
<p>7 - That’s not really a problem … UNLESS you have a few friends who like BM and they have a pore pc … so they wanna play it on your computer … and they’ll most likelly go to the last unlocked chapter and they’ll be like "oh fuck i don’t have any weapons … and then they are like "um … how can i cheat or something ? and so on … this way if the only the first one is there thy will be forced to play the game as it was meant to be played  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>4 - Thanks for that … see ya</p>

            <p>I’ll pitch in a little as well.</p>
<p>1a: You could also drop your video settings.</p>
<p>2b: Bhopping is still possible-ish, but it’s very difficult and the speed boost isn’t so great.</p>
<p>3b: It says Enable Iron Sights, but it’s only for the .357. The option exists solely because purists complained about that addition on that single weapon.</p>
<p>5: Because it runs on Source which is almost exclusively a Steam thing, and therefore requires Steam to run (like all Steam games). Run Steam in Offline mode.</p>
<p>7: This has no bearing on anything whatsoever, but if you really find it an issue, use the console command “sv_unlockedchapters 1”</p>

            <p>I will only answer a few questions, as the gameplay related ones were already answered by the previous post.</p>
<p>1a - It has a lot of stuff that loads all at once but installing the mod on a solid state drive will help quite a bit.<br>
2b - Bunnyhop doesn’t belong on a well paced single-player campaign and I don’t care about speedruns.<br>
4 - <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Main_Menu" data-bbcode="true">https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Main_Menu</a><br>
6 - The version of the engine used by the mod is directx 9 only. Why do you want Directx 10 anyway? It was trash. If anything you’d want DX11.<br>
7 - How is this a problem?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>1a-this is because of the games large amount of entities, brushes, etc. on each map</p>
<p>1b-this is most likely source</p>
<p>2a- this is changed in black mesa. If you want the original jumps, go to skill.cfg and set the vertical setting on a regular jump to around 250</p>
<p>2b- sadly, no bunny hop</p>
<p>3a- go back to skill.cfg and change the health if you want</p>
<p>3b- if this is the magnum, there is no alt fire apart from ironsights</p>
<p>4- I can’t get to my game now, but train fail safe means when you get off the tram it shuts off.  Check the BMS wiki.</p>
<p>5- yes. Find the go offline button in the steam dropdown menu</p>
<p>6- I do not know about this problem.</p>
<p>7- there is, but the chapters being unlocked has no effect on the game.</p>
