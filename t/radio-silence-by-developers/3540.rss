    <description>hey, first of all id like to start by saying it is hard to accualy DO anything in these forums, i know im new, but im not a spammer, a n00b or a lolzorwtfbbqharharpiratesninjaz kinda guy, but i still cannot do well... ANYTHING on these forums, most things i do not have the permission for, and most threads i try to reply on are mostly closed or other. i just dont know how to well... progress in this place, simple as that. Halp plez?

anyway, my main point. we havent (well i havent anyway) heard anything from the developer of this mod for a pretty long time, i frequently check their youtube channel, the news section of these forums, etc, but i cannot find anything.
now this may be a fault of MINE, but in the off-chance that it is not, i would like to simply say that it would be nice for the Devs to just release a small piece of media, just SOMETHING on a weekly, bi-weekly, hell... MONTHLY rate, just to let us know that all is well in game-making land. now i understand this is all done on their spare time and that they have lives and jobs to work, and thats all very well and good. just a LITTLE something every now and then, even a 5 second snippet, i jsut want assurance that this thing is making progress.

Cheers,
