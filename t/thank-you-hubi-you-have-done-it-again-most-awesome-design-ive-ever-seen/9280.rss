            <p>First post of mine here <span class="bbcode-b">just</span> to agree with the original poster - the site design is very clean, I can navigate the pages easily, and whoever designed the wiki did one hell of a job too.</p>
<p>I just have one issue though, after clicking anywhere on the forums I can’t use the arrow keys to scroll up and down? I’m using IE 9, and I’m noticing a second scrollbar beside the actual scrollbar, and when I click on the original scrollbar, I can scroll with the arrow keys again.</p>
<p>Other than that somewhat cumbersome bug, great job on the site, and great job with the mod…I actually had a <span class="bbcode-b">dream</span> that I was playing BM xD</p>
