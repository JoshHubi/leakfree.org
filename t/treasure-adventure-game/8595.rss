    <description>Okay, so the guys at GoG are giving away the new game &#39;Treasure Adventure Game&#39;. I&#39;m currently about two hours into the game, and i am enjoying it as far as now. It&#39;s an adventure sidescroller, and it seems like there&#39;s a lot to this game.

Well, the link is here: [url]https://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/treasure_adventure_game[/url]

Just thought i would share this great game with you. And who doesn&#39;t like free games?  :wink: 

And what do you guys think of the game?</description>

            <p>I totally agree with you, this game is fucking awesome. I am like 6 hours into the game, and really enjoying it. It kind of reminds me of zelda, yet totally different.</p>
