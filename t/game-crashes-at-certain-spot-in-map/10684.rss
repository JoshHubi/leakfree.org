    <title>Game crashes at certain spot in map.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-at-certain-spot-in-map/10684</link>
    <description>My cousin comes up to me and tells me he crashed with this error:

&quot;Too many verts for a dynamic buffer (33970&gt;32768 ) Tell a programmer to up the VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE.&quot;


He said that he crashed every time he was in the certain spot, so I go ahead and try it myself.

This is the spot he described to me.

So I go ahead and did the same attempt as he did, hit the button, go against the corner of the beam and crouch, and let the map load, while holding down the crouch button.

This is the result:

I suddenly get stuck in the floor. So he told me he started to press a bunch of buttons when he got stuck and it crashed on him with the error, though I couldn&#39;t do it, so I killed myself, load up game, and I am now going through the map, so I do hit a bunch of keys(movement, firing, reload, running, etc) and it errors out giving me the same error:

&quot;Too many verts for a dynamic buffer (35713&gt;32768 ) Tell a programmer to up the VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE.&quot;

This is the map:
&quot;bm_c3a1b at: 1354 x, 129 y, -1479 z&quot;

I am also attaching the mini dump for you to check.
