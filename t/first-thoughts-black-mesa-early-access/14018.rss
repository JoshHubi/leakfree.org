    <title>First thoughts - Black Mesa Early Access</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/first-thoughts-black-mesa-early-access/14018</link>
    <description>First of i cannot say how amazed i am about how much the game was changed.
I am writing this before i even got to the Resonance Cascade scene, and i feel like
one of the guys from this video:
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRscYVvEFt8&#39;]80&#39;s Aerobic[/url]   :smiley:  
In common words, i feel exited as hell.With all those tiny details that are greater
than in the free mod version.In my opinion 19,99€ is well worth the money for the
game.And take note of course that this game is built by die-hard fans who know
the Valve titles and their ways for years.  :thumbup: 

So at that point it really pisses me of when certain BM forum or other people
complain about the game.
 :cursing: 

And on another note, and relevant to the ARG thread i found this white board
in the lab segment before the hazard suit room with lockers.
One thing that stood out is the red writings.In the end it says:
EXT 384 BIOME

            <p>Well i tried multiplayer.<br>
I had a bit of a problem.<br>
The game runs fine in a closed small areas.<br>
But glitches like crazy in open areas or areas<br>
filled with animations.</p>
<p>I tried lowering everything, but didn’t help.<br>
Eventually it crashed.</p>
