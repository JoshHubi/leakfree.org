    <title>Doom 3 BFG Edition</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/doom-3-bfg-edition/8815</link>
    <description>So if you guys haven&#39;t heard yet, id Software is releasing a new version of the old Doom 3. As far as the video shows, it looks a lot like the same old game. They say they put in a few new levels though, but for me, it just looks like they are just greedy and want money. If this is going to be sold for 50 or 60 bucks, then no way i am buying this.

            <p>Little known fact: Carmack is adding in full support for a DIY virtual reality HMD set, and the set might actually ship with this if he has his way. It even has some movement support, so you can look around a bit just using the headset.</p>
<p>That is fucking cool, and I’ll probably pick both of those things up if I don’t quit my job before then…</p>

            <p>I’d get it just for the sake of vibration feedback. Doom 3 is enthralling as hell and i was a little mad that there wasn’t gamepad support for the PC version.</p>
<p>An extra slice of immersion in that dept.</p>

<p>From what I saw, looks like they took the PC version, and ported it to the current consoles, and added a flashlight attached to your gun, some extra levels and a boss. It comes with all the doom games, but seeing as how I own all of them already, and I can download much better graphics mods for the original, not much point to it.</p>
