A self described &quot;tweedpunk&quot; videogame. You play a human character stuck on an archipelago being hunted for sport by tea-drinking English robots and their dogs. Your objective is to escape. It&#39;s primarily a stealth and survival game. There&#39;s the standard light-based stealth as well as a custom foliage stealth system. All the levels are procedurally generated.

It&#39;s been worked on for quite a while but they&#39;ve decided they need a bit of money via Kickstarter to finish the game off.

Out of all the indie games I&#39;ve seen in development this one is the most exciting for me. I wish the Kickstarter donations weren&#39;t in pounds though because it&#39;s so expensive.</description>

<p>The game’s panel from Rezzed. They talk about the way they create the levels and how the AI and stuff works as well as some cool and funny things they’ve encountered because of the game being totally dynamic.</p>

            <p>There will be a multiplayer addon released after the singleplayer is done. There’s not much info about it yet but I think it’s more co-op than anything. Four people in a game or something.</p>

            <p>Awesome, it would be nice if you could eventually go into the houses, even if it is all just one house type, but either way, that looks pretty awesome. Would love a multiplayer version.</p>

<p>New update for the game talking about the new biomes they’ve implemented into the game. The Fens (swampy place I guess) and mountains, where the island is split up by three large mountains and there’s less settlements to loot.</p>

            <p>New update.<br>
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499900830/sir-you-are-being-hunted/posts/408343" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499900830/sir-you-are-being-hunted/posts/408343</a></p>
<p>Mostly about the procedural generation stuff including tailoring it to how you like and trying to make each island feel different. Ax combat is good apparently too and there’s some concept art for different enemies at the end. Some screenshots throughout too.<br>

            <p>So the game was funded and there have been a few updates. Most recent update is some new animations for the robots. Regular updates from now on too which I hope means weekly at least. Here’s the video</p>

            <p>$80,000 stretch goal was reached, so multiplayer will be in shortly after the game’s release. Final stretch goal is $100,000 and adds full character customization for both single and multiplayer as well as a third person option. Don’t think we’ll get there though it would be nice to.</p>

            <p>As far as I know you have to survive while trying to find pieces of a machine that will help you get off the island.</p>
<p>Four thousand more pounds until the final enemy addon and another ten thousand after that for multiplayer. I don’t care about the multiplayer but I at least want that final enemy. So get to pledging people!</p>

            <p>They’ve made their goal and have made a couple of stretch goals.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">£45,000 - The Landowner </span> UNLOCKED<br>
At this amount we’ll be expanding our NPC roster with “The  Landowner.” This chap is an aberrant mechanical ultra-toff. He’s a  leader among hunters, and the nightmare gaze of his glowing monocle  means near-certain death, and at the very least lots of peril. With The  Landowner in play, the player is truly in trouble – his tracking skills  and his riflemanship are peerless. Fear him.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">£50,000 - Hunting!  </span>UNLOCKED<br>
This stretch goal will allow us to include additional  wildlife-slaying functionality. You will be able to hunt pheasants and  rabbits and then cook them for sustenance. This will provide a  complementary mode of survival for players aside from scavenging, as  well as furnishing the world of Sir with more life. (And death.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">£55,000 - The Castle biome.    </span><br>
A completely new island type on which a ruined castle is  procedurally generated across the entire island. This will provide the  game with both a radically different terrain, and an atmospheric arena  in which to be systematically hunted down and shot. (We’re really  excited about this one – more proc-gen makes Tom happy.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And the next stretch goal will add balloon spotters/snipers.</p>
