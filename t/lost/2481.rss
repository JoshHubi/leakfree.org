    <description>I can’t believe there isn’t one of these threads already

Lost, the mind blowing riddle of a group of survivors stranded on a mysterious island with polar bears, smoke monsters and mysterious hatches, is coming to an end this year, and there’s less than a month to go before the final season begins. What have been your favorite highlights throughout the past five years? Who has been your favorite character? Have you any clue how this show will a) begin its sixth season and b) end? And have you enjoyed the ride? 

For me my favorite highlight will always be Hurley, the Dharma van and his rescue mission at the end of season three, makes me smile every time, and my favorite character would be Mikhail, but he was only in it for a season, so I’ll say Ben

As for season 6 I haven&#39;t a clue, but here are some clues to consider

[url=&#39;https://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=62104&#39;]A new promotional pic[/url] recently released, I personally think with the way they are postioned, those on the right will be the &quot;white&quot; (Jacobs) side and those on the left being the &quot;black&quot; (BSG) side, with Sayid the Judas amongst the BSG camp, but isn&#39;t it intresting that would be almost similar to the last Lost split in season 4

The hieroglyphics mean who is the leader, writen once in white and then again in black

* BSG stands for Black Shirt Guy, the one we saw at the start of the season 5 finale</description>

            <p>well this weeks lost was a real treat, finally some big answers are starting to reveal themselves but as ever only bigger questions follow, i’m voting Sawyer in the upcoming elections for leader of the island  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . But why wasn’t Kate on the wall/a candiate?  And I loved Smokey cam, hopefully we’ll see more of that. And an ageless man crapping himself… i only hope smokey lives up to all this hype! And who was the boy? Jacob? I can’t wait till next week this week I smelt closure in the air this week, and it smelt good</p>

<p>omg that was frogurt! Flaming arrow guy? <a href="https://frogurtisjacob.homestead.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The man once believed to be Jacob!</a></p>
<p>Slight spoiler warning for the episode LA X</p>
<p>Yeah the premiere was a great start for the final season, only Lost can answer questions but straight after ask another bigger question, I might go as far to say its the best start to a season Lost has had since its pilot. I’m glad James is going rouge again, I love angry Sawyer and now you really feel for the guy. I loved all the little things in the alternate timeline, like Charlie saying “I was suppose to die”, Hurley saying “He’s the luckiest guy in the world”, its like meeting them all for the first time again. And I loved all the cameo roles, that bird from the tailies, the kids, Artz! No expense spared lol. Juilets last words “It worked”, what does it all mean?? And finally we got some confirmation about Alpert he was on the Black Rock!! I believe the alternate time line will be caused by something later on, maybe its like an alternate flash forward, maybe the last scene in the series is walt telling jack in this alternate flash forward, that “hes got to go back!!”. And OMG the islands under water (With one of the sharks from season 2!), what was that all about?</p>

<p>This, a thousand times.</p>
<p>Personally, I like it. For me, it’s a great show. It might be shit to some of you, but everyone’s entitled to an opinion. Either you like it or you don’t. In the cases of things like this, the feelings are extremely strong 99% of the time.<br>
I want to know what the temple is all about, why the fake Locke is still in Locke form, and who exactly is coming.<br>
The split timeline is shaping up to be pretty good, too. I can’t wait to see what happens to Kate now that she’s excaped the airport.</p>
<p>Also, does anyone remember who exactly the guy who was sleeping beside Locke and in the taxi line is? He’s familiar, but I can’t place what he did on the island.</p>

<p>Lost Haters: you are in a thread about Lost.  I suppose it isn’t the best place to be?  I don’t really like GTA4, so I stay away from those threads, I don’t preach how terrible it is.</p>
<p>Lost Likers: you don’t need to attack someone for voicing an opinion.  Take the high road, accept they are different than you, and move on.</p>

<p>I don’t hate it, it just gets on my nerves when mediocre things are seen as amazing. Harry Potter being a perfect example.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>i wouldnt say mediocre the reason this show and harry potter, for example, are  popular is because it stands a top the field of genre it sits in</p>
<p>Childern Fantasy Films are normally poor apart from the odd gem like Bridges to Terrabitha, and sometimes the simple ideas are the best, kids can relate to harry potter because its his journey through school, with a fun little mystrey and a “fantastical” element thrown in to make it a little more intresting. The books themselves are better then the films, its not Lord of the Rings level of literature not even Charlie and the Choclate Factory, its just a good fun read that captures your imgination</p>
<p>Lost, look at its comeptition, its poor, I’m not talking X-Files, Supernatural etc here, because Lost is in many ways a lot like a soap, with one big difference it has an element of fantasy. action and science fiction thrown in. And for six years now it has delivered the goods, brillant cast, brilliant writing and a brillant story in terms of being a soap</p>
<p>Some people don’t like these genres, so its fair to speculate they wont like Harry Potter or Lost, and thats fair enough but to hate it? I just don’t get why</p>

            <p>I don’t hate it, it just gets on my nerves when mediocre things are seen as amazing. Harry Potter being a perfect example.</p>

            <p>i really cant understand why some of you hate it with such passion, if you dont like it fair enough, but that doesnt suddenly make the show, the writing and the actors in it “a load of sh*t”, look at JJ the man is an amazing talent and was the co-creator of this wonderful show, Emmerson and o quinn amazing actors and to top this off the show has great twists <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCrNH7SRDbg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">take this breathtaking momment as an example</a>. And I can’t think of many shows like this on TV, Flashforward? What a flop be lucky to last till the end of its second season. Heroes? Been limping since the exploding man. Jericho/Invasion came close but were cancelled before there time. The point being not many shows can keep there stories as engaging and as intresting for such a long time as well as Lost</p>
<p>And Emmerson so deserved his award, the guy is brillant</p>

<p>Like I’ve already stated that is not the case, a lot of answers have already been revealed and are fitting in to place in its final season. Sometimes they have to strech things out but that is the nature of TV when you have such a linear story. Things make sense but you have to watch it from start to finish to get it</p>
<p>And your constant refrences to the X-Files are irrellevant, X-Files was just simply a twist on every other cop show that we are forced to endure, it was strecthed out far to long and its BS Mulders gone missing! ark was a fine example of a show that went on when it should have ended and one that was made up as it went along. Every season it was the same thing, it never radically dared to change its format to suite its story</p>
<p>As for charchters Lost has some of the finest, Ben Linus is regarded by many as one of TV’S greatest ever bad guys (The actor even won an award last year), Locke, Charlie, Sawyer, Sun, Des ‘n’ Pen, Hurley are a few more fine examples of charchters with intresting back storys and strong personailtys, none have never really strayed from there charchters or done anything out of charchter. The writers have even said Charchters in Lost is their first thought in writing. And I’m sure Des ‘n’ Pens phonecall won an award as well, Charlies scrafice should have done but hey can’t win 'em all. So again that arguement is irrellevant</p>
<p>Losts viewing figures ain’t brillant think its been between 5 and 10 million in America the past couple of years, can’t be sure, so if it isn’t the viewing figures what win Lost awards, I wonder what it is?</p>

            <p>Awards generally don’t mean a hell of a lot, and the fact that it’s talked about means even less. People always used to talk about Friends, and you can’t honestly say <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> was an amazing show.</p>

            <p>How can you say it’s an incoherent mess of unfinished ideas if you haven’t watched it consistently?</p>
<p>I’m not going to say it has a super duper great deep story, but it is compelling and interesting if you follow it, and if you like it.</p>
<p>You’re acting the way the those Lost fans you hate act.</p>

            <p>I don’t like it and I don’t mind that other people do like it. What I hate about it is the fact that people keep insisting that it’s this great show with a deep story even though it’s just an incoherent mess of unfinished ideas.</p>
<p>I can find no better example of this type of show done right than the X-Files. That was a show that had mystery and interesting plot twists, AND a deep story and fleshed out characters.</p>
