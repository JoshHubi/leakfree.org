<p>And HL Source is slightly better and less buggy than HL Vanilla, so use that one.</p>

<p>If I were you I’d at least play through Half Life. Source or not, you should have the experience before playing BM.</p>

<p>The main reason to download Half-Life: Source is this: It takes the old textures, models, etc and adds the new source engine physics. For example, in the original Half-Life, when you shot someone they would shake in place and then fall backwards. Or if it was a soldier, they would slump and fall to the ground and all of them died similarly. However, with the source version, they all die differently depending on where they are shot and the interaction with the environment. The water, particles, and explosions take their queue from the source engine as well. Everything reacts different because of the source physics as opposed to the old version. I have both, but mainly play the source version. I keep the older one around for nostalgia. However, I purchased Half-Life Source when it was on sale for $5. Now, as of May 9th 2010, it is $9.99.</p>

<p>hasnt everyone here played threw HL at least twice?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, there are a lot of people here who were introduced to the Half Life series by Half Life 2 and never actually played through the original story. Some people are specifically NOT playing Half Life so they can do Black Mesa as a completely fresh game (which will make for an interesting perspective) but many holdouts have changed their mind when they realize the goldsource mods they would get access to with the original game.</p>
<p>Personally I’ve been completely through half life about 4 times, once on hard. It’s hard to be completely accurate because there have been a few times I’ve played through and got distracted for a couple weeks in the middle so I started back over at the beginning. I think I’ve only played through Half Life 2 about 2 times total and have yet to play it on hard.</p>

            <p>I’d say it depends:</p>
<p>If you want to play Black Mesa to see if it’s a respectable remake of half-life(source), go download.<br>
On the other hand if your just playing it to complete the plot in the half-life saga, then u can make BM your first experience. It’s either that or your exceedingly cheap…</p>
<p>I go with the second one… namely being  a cheapskate <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>The order I’d recommend playing them in is: Half-Life, followed by Decay (with a friend, since it’s meant to be co-op) or Blue Shift.  Opposing Force should be saved for last, IMHO.  Playing either Decay or Blue Shift after having gone through Opposing Force can be somewhat anticlimactic, I think, for reasons I think you’ll discover.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not only that, but in terms of in-game time line, Blue Shift actually comes before Opposing Force, while Half Life starts a little before blue shift starts, and theoretically ends a little before Opposing Force ends.</p>

            <p>Isn’t there already an epically long thread about whether or not someone should play Half-Life 1 before Black Mesa, and if so, which version?</p>

            <p>I too vote for playing Half-Life 1 before playing Black Mesa.  I think you’ll enjoy the Black Mesa experience much more, if you’re versed enough in the original to be able to identify all the little nods, improvements, and changes from the original that the devs may have made.  I think it’ll be a richer experience being able to witness the huge transition first-hand, rather than playing Black Mesa knowing little more than “this is an improvement of an old 90s game.”</p>
<p>Not only that, but if you play Black Mesa first, you may run the risk of finding it difficult to go back the original, if you decide to try it out later on.  I know that for me, at least, it tends to be a lot harder to go back in time with a videogame than it is to go forward.  Once you’re exposed to an updated title, it’s just kind of a pain to go back to the original, somehow.  Although, you might already be running this risk, since you played through Half-Life 2 already… (Shame on you, by the way! :fffuuu:  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>
<p>I also vote for playing the <span class="bbcode-i">original </span>rather than the <span class="bbcode-i">source </span>version of Half-Life 1, due to reasons already mentioned, especially by Grey Acumen and coldroll.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a mind to play through the entire Half-Life 1 <span class="bbcode-i">Saga</span>, (Half-Life, Opposing Force, Blue Shift, and Decay,) and not just Half-Life <span class="bbcode-i">1</span>, then I absolutely second what Spockjedi said, although I would personally recommend playing through the games in a slightly different order, for reasons I’ll mention shortly.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I’d recommend picking up the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/40/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Half-Life 1 Anthology</a> from Steam. ($15) (If you just want Half-Life 1, both the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">original</a> and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/280/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Source</a> versions are $10.)</li>
<li>After that, if you’re so inclined, I’d recommend installing <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3157-QDVN-1426" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HD pack</a>, unless you prefer the original, <a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/File:Barneys.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">old-school graphics</a>.</li>
<li>Lastly, as Spockjedi mentioned, don’t forget about <a href="https://old.hl-improvement.com/downloads.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Unlocked</a> for Blue Shift (fixes some bugs that never got addressed when Blue Shift was ported to Steam from GoldSrc from Dreamcast… long story) and also <a href="https://decay.half-lifecreations.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Half-Life: Decay</a>, which was ported by fans from PS2 to PC fairly recently.</li>
</ul>
<p>The order I’d recommend playing them in is: Half-Life, followed by Decay (with a friend, since it’s meant to be co-op) or Blue Shift.  Opposing Force should be saved for last, IMHO.  Playing either Decay or Blue Shift after having gone through Opposing Force can be somewhat anticlimactic, I think, for reasons I think you’ll discover.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr - Yes, play the <span class="bbcode-i">original</span> (not source) Half-Life 1 before Black Mesa.</span> Also see bullet points above. :3</p>

            <p>And physics.</p>
<p>The original is worth getting over Source, though. It may be cheaper, too. I cba to check at the moment.</p>

<p>If that was long time ago then acquire it and play from the beginning. If it was recently and you really don’t want to go from the start, acquire it and find a savegame from somewhere.</p>
