            <p>I know that Carlos wanted to release the complete Black Mesa source resources - or at least he did as of a couple years back.</p>

            <p>I personally think the new placements make more sence, anyway.</p>

            <p>Decompile the maps, move them yourself and recompile them. Otherwise you’re out of luck.</p>
