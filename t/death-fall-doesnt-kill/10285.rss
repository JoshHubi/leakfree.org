    <title>Death fall doesn&#39;t kill</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/death-fall-doesnt-kill/10285</link>
    <description>On the part where you are jumping between two conveyors to avoid being crushed, I fell, and couldn&#39;t find my way back up. After a while I went back into the water and found out that I could swim through a crate, which leads me to believe that the area isn&#39;t meant to be explored and that the fall should have killed me. So, is this a bug or am I just an idiot for not being able to find the way out?</description>

<p>Well, yah, there is a door down there, but that just leads to another room on the same level where I can’t find a way up. If you can say there is a way back up, I will continue looking, but for now it looks like a bug to me.</p>
<p>EDIT: Ok, I’m an idiot. =P there is a way out. Still, you shouldn’t be able to swim through the box.</p>
