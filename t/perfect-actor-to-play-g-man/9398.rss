    <title>PERFECT actor to play G-Man!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/perfect-actor-to-play-g-man/9398</link>
    <description>After having watched The Human Centipede, I believe that German actor Dieter Laser would be the ideal casting choice to portray the G-Man in the hypothetical Half-Life major motion picture.

Just from observing his mannerisms and facial expressions, I feel he could easily exude the creepiness and mysterious nature of such a character...

Agree? Disagree?  I&#39;d like to know any comments or opinions you may have on this subject matter.
