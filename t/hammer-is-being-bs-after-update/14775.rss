This is pure annoying, its not showing the nodraw? or WTF IS THIS IT WASNT THERE BEFORE UPDATE

This is exactly the same map on different hammer versions</description>

            <p>Yes, just to be perfectly clear: Hammer does not decide in any way whatsoever what your computer or graphics card does with it. That’s entirely down to the hardware manufacturer and what they do with their drivers, which we obviously have zero influence over. If Hammer is running on integrated graphics, then it ALWAYS was. It just never caused a graphical issue before, because our engine supported SM2.0 and lower Direct X, which is what integrated graphics used. For optimisation, development and performance, we stripped out all the old, mostly deprecated stuff, which will be the reason why you’re getting visual issues now. No other reason!</p>

            <p>Hammer isn’t forcing it to use integrated graphics. Your laptop decided to use it for Hammer. If you open your GPU’s control panel you can see what its settings for Hammer are.</p>

            <p>I’m a noob in technical stuff.</p>
<p>I don’t see how Black Mesa’s hammer can force my laptop to run the integrated graphics other than the graphics card. Is there a way to figure out if it indeed does?</p>
<p>I also use AMD HD Radeo 5650 (Old, yes)</p>
<p>Is it possible that this can be the cause as well: quoted from “Known Issues”:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD video cards may not display CSM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or what</p>

            <p>don’t know if this helps, from dev     TextFAMGUY1<br>
We removed a crapload of old shaders from the game with this update, for optimisation and performance reasons. It’s likely that your Hammer is trying to load at a Direct X level below 9, or at Shader Model 2.0, which causes it to have many display issues as we removed those shaders. I would know as I had this exact same problem when the old stuff was stripped out.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a fix. When this happened to me, it was because my laptop was making Hammer run from the integrated graphics rather than my graphics card. So I used the Nvidia Control Panel to tell it to use the graphics card, and voila! Fixed! So, try and make sure your computer isn’t forcing Hammer to use integrated graphics, that is likely the issue.</p>

            <p>Try restarting the computer and open only hammer, don’t start any games b4. I’ve had troubles with CS:GO when using hammer after having opened it.<br>
I don’t have any issues at the moment, I’m using the beta version and launching hammer through the bin folder.</p>
<p>Double click on the manifest, and click on the X in the top right corner. It’ll free some space. I just hate it when people have useless tabs in the menu, wasting precious viewport space =)</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve decompiled the map?  Have you decompiled it to learn or something more sinister? (the _d makes it look like it’s decompiled).</li>
</ul>
