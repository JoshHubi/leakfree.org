    <title>Exploit in &quot;On A Rail&quot; [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/exploit-in-on-a-rail-fixed/10167</link>
    <description>This physics exploit takes place directly after you&#39;ve launched the sattelite. When you walk out of the room, there is a locked door to your right. This physics exploit can get you past that door.

Watch closely:

You are not supposed to go through this door, even though the windows can be smashed.

![](upload://6I6PuuEmauXO02up6hgyYXrei26.jpeg)
However, with the assistance of this waste disposal unit, you can!

![](upload://6I6PuuEmauXO02up6hgyYXrei26.jpeg)
Simply place it in front of the door like this...

...jump on top of it...

..and crouch jump through the upper window!

It&#39;s obvious that you were never supposed to be here.

            <p>There have been a lot of moments in BM that made me think of when I listen to the Half Life episodes and Portal commentary, how they go on about how they changed stuff because playtesters would keep doing the wrong things or think they should be doing something else.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed a lot of places in BM like this, where I think we’re not shown what we’re supposed to be doing clearly. Granted I didn’t have a problem but I know other people would sit there trying to do the wrong thing, like constantly jumping to try and reach a ladder that isn’t even real… The help part of this forum shows a lot of the things that would probably be removed if this was Valve’s game and they playtested it the way they do…</p>
<p>Not a problem really though, for me, I end up trying different things till I find the right way, I guess some people will be convinced they are supposed to do something that they aren’t and then come here saying it doesn’t work when it wasn’t the correct way or route.</p>
<p>I did try to get through the door in the OP a few times but then just figured I wasn’t meant to so looked around some more…</p>

            <p>I actually have a problem with those doors in general. There are many, MANY places that use those doors in place of impassible barriers, and even though they do work more often than not, they look weird. There’s one in Surface Tension, for instance, in the first tunnel you meet after exiting. It looks like I could go into it and down a hallway, but I can’t “because of the reason.”</p>
<p>I think simply switching them to non-breakable glass will solve the problem in every instance where those doors are used to block paths. The only place where breaking said glass is an issue, it gets broken by a scripted event, not by a player (where we used to get the crowbar) so I don’t see it causing any unforeseen consequences.</p>

<p>I know that. Why do you think I called it an exploit and said multiple times that the player was obviously not supposed to go there?</p>

<p>I don’t mean to be insulting, but did the devs not playtest looking for exploits hard enough? There’s quite a few here and there, and ones like this would be fixed simply by putting a player clip in the window. I’m not saying they’re incompetent or anything, quite the contrary. It’s just at this point players know you can fit through those windows, so why not block it off?</p>

<p>Anything that doesn’t gets less playtesting in its entire development time than it does on the first day by the community. I can understand why they would have missed this glitch. Not saying they should have had a public beta or anything</p>

            <p>I had no idea where to continue so I went in here (it made the most sense since the door opened to that way). I had posted this in another irrelevant thread but it belongs here.</p>
<p>In On A Rail, just after launching the rocket, when you break through the glass doors and turn around, things don’t look quite right. The map is c2a2c and I am facing toward the wall. I have attached screenshots of what this looks like.</p>
