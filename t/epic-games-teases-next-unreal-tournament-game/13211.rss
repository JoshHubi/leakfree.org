            <p>I still couldn’t believe it that time I played it and killed a Skaarj, and he fell to the ground and I left and when I came back his body was gone and he attacked me from behind.</p>
<p>I wish more games had better enemy AI</p>

            <p>One of the great things about Unreal is that you always felt at a disadvantage to the enemies, but not so much that you couldn’t overcome them. You never became overpowered, but you were never too underpowered to win any confrontation. It walked a fine line of challenging and fun. I just played it for the second time a few months ago (I played it in 2001 and then lost the disk to a friend…) and loved it all over again. That game was awesome.</p>

<p>Unreal 2 was fun, so were all the games really (yes even UT3, as barebones as it was), but what REALLY made Unreal and Unreal Tournament special was the <span class="bbcode-b">atmosphere</span> which I don’t think Epic has really caught on to yet. Needs moar 1990s future stuff, Alien Isolation style. Also ancient temples and dark, gritty, SHARP graphics. Not cartoon world or blobby muscle balls rolling around in a burry bloom-fuzz land.</p>

            <p>I thought the NPC’s in the Half-Life series were pretty well implemented. I think that certain NPC’s though, like Alyx, are better implemented than others. However, that’s because that particular character is supposed to be with you through more difficult situations. For NPC’s in a remade Unreal, they would need to only be a temporary thing really. Co-Op would be my first choice though, before any NPC partners.</p>

<p>NPC combat allies are almost always badly implemented in video games, so I’d in general just rather they not be there. Co-Op’s all good though.</p>

            <p>I’d rather have just co-op even</p>
<p>Maybe have a handful of friendly NPCs, but I like how lonely the game is and the only friendly NPCs not speaking english adds to that IMO.</p>
<p>I also liked stuff like that in other games, like having all the npcs speak russian in STALKER save for essential plot details.</p>

            <p>And em they ACTUALLY have you arrive at it xD</p>
<p>One thing at I didn’t like about Unreal was the lack of friendly NPC’s. You had the Nali, but all the humans were dead the entire time. If they re-made it, that’s the only thing I’d want differently: friendly AI that could help you fight. Or even a co-op that is actually supported on it.</p>

            <p>Yeah it’s mostly visual/environmental storytelling, which I love, as well as that whole “decide your own level of immersion” thing too.</p>
<p>Like, one of the small details is with the sunspire, how you can see it in the skybox from the very beginning of the game and as you progress through the maps it keeps getting bigger, acting as a sort of landmark of your progress and it also had the added effect the first time through if you noticed it of making you anticipate arriving at it.</p>

            <p>I just felt that Unreal 2 wasn’t nearly as solid of a game as the original. But it had its ups, like an actual compass/ objective tracker, story (which unreal didn’t lack, it just didn’t portray in a way that was easy to discern without added reading…which isn’t bad, I loved it) and there were a few gameplay elements I liked. It just didn’t live up to my inner Unreal fanboy.</p>

            <p>Unreal 2 was fun, so were all the games really (yes even UT3, as barebones as it was), but what REALLY made Unreal and Unreal Tournament special was the <span class="bbcode-b">atmosphere</span> which I don’t think Epic has really caught on to yet. Needs moar 1990s future stuff, Alien Isolation style. Also ancient temples and dark, gritty, SHARP graphics. Not cartoon world or blobby muscle balls rolling around in a burry bloom-fuzz land.</p>

            <p>I liked Unreal 2  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Playing it years before I played the first game (which was great) probably helped…</p>
<p>Unreal Tournament 2004 was my favourite of the UT games I’ve played (UT99, 2k4, 3)</p>

<p>Unreal and it’s expansion were awesome. Unreal 2 sucked ass. Never really cared about the Tournament games, but I enjoyed them enough when other people insisted they be played and I felt like participating, but I only ever played 99 and 2003. The quick turnaround for 2004 annoyed me, and I was done with multiplayer completely by the time the next one came out.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve played most of the tournaments (not the newest). They’re all solid, IMO, but I’m a firm Unreal/Na Pali fan. Which I’ve made obvious before xD in another conversation with you and several others. I did try Unreal 2, since it was on sale and I completely agree: they totally fucked up everything that made the first game great, and didn’t really add much to the story.</p>

            <p>To me this looks like it is a cooperation between the UE-dev community and EPIC.</p>
<p>I might be wrong, but it could be something like Black Mesa. An officially approved mod With the difference that it will be a new game instead of a “remake”.</p>

<p>Alright, I’m pretty bloody excited here.</p>
<p>I can’t even say how much I hope they do a remake/expansion on UT99. They should pull an Alien Isolation and build the game out of the old 1990s “future” they had going on. Bring back chunky plain weapons and all the old style characters and arenas. Expand character customization and add a hub world for the single player tournament. Expand on UT2004’s team/budget management, oh man, I need to stop speculating because I’m just going to disappoint myself.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I would fucking kill for onslaught/vehicle ctf (i.e. any type of vehicular warfare) with the UT99 weapons.</p>
