            <p>First off, the Engi ship isn’t weaponless. The Ion Blast II and combat drone combo is one of the most effective loadouts in the game. You can kill the rebel flagship with it.</p>
<p>Second, there are two ways to unlock new ships in AE: By either completing the the unlock quest for that particular ship, or beating the boss with the previous ship in the layout you can see in the hangar menu. Once you have a ship, you can unlock an alternate layout B by getting two of that ship’s three achievements, and then unlock layout C by getting to the final sector with the B layout.</p>

            <p>so, I like this game, but I was only able to unlock like 3 extra ships.  how on earth was I supposed to get the rest of those ships?  I mean, I was getting pretty damn good IMO, able to win on a somewhat consistent basis;  but I’ve never been able to unlock anything other than the p*nis ship, stealth ship, and engi weaponless ship.  what gives?</p>

            <p>It is. It adds various new features, new weapons, systems, and ship layouts, and an entirely new race to the game. You can even disable the new stuff if you don’t like it.</p>
<p>There’s also an iPad edition of the game in the works, though I’m not sure if that’s out yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ftlgame.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.ftlgame.com</a> seems to be overloaded, by the way.</p>
<p>Edit: BTW, the new music is amazing, <a href="https://benprunty.bandcamp.com/album/ftl-advanced-edition-soundtrack" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">and you can listen to it for free.</a></p>

            <p>My FTL updated so it looks like it is released. I’m pretty sure it’s free for people who have the game so yeah.</p>
