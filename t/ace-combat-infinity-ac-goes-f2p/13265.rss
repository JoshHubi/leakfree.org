    <title>Ace Combat Infinity- AC goes F2P</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ace-combat-infinity-ac-goes-f2p/13265</link>
    <description>I tried the beta a few months ago- the game felt very similar to Ace Combat 6 in terms of plane handling, graphical horsepower, and such. Set in an alternate history present, the Earth got pelted with a shitton of meteors, and only certain areas managed to get through it because of a giant array of massive railguns. Somehow. It&#39;s explained in the storyline- yes, a full on single player story is accessible from Ace Infinity, but you have to expend fuel tanks to play it. (There is an option to buy unlimited story access for $20, which is not a bad deal considering Ace 6 set people back $60.)

Anyway, [url=&#39;https://www.acecombat-infinity.com/&#39;]it&#39;s out now.[/url] Surprisingly little fanfare- I was hoping to see a bit more marketing with this one. Figured I&#39;d spread the word here because I&#39;d love to find some people to play with.</description>
