    <title>&quot;Engine Error: Too many verts...&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/engine-error-too-many-verts/10164</link>
    <description>I get this message when I&#39;m hanging out in the level where you&#39;re in the meat room: 
&quot;Engine Error: Too many verts for a dynamic vertex buffer (36012 &gt; 32768 ) Tell a programmer to up VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE.&quot;

If this fix is not one that can be done soon, anything that can be done in the meantime? Thanks so much, Black Mesa programmers and contributors.</description>

<p>Reduce my resolution down to 640x480 from 1680x1050??? Haha what??? I’m never doing that. That’s a solution of course, but I’m not compensating by reducing quality THAT much. Maybe some of the antialiasing and some other stuff I might’ve turned up too high for the game to handle</p>

<p>I’m saying, lower your resolution by that much, get through your FPS dropping area, and then raise it back up.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">   Also anti-aliasing isn’t really needed unless your 1680x1050 monitor is like, 48 inches wide. xDD  Anti-aliasing you would really need if you were running really anything below heck even 1600x900.</p>

            <p>Source games generally profile your hardware and set graphics for you (or have for me) If you’re running it higher than your computer can handle its not a game issue.</p>

<p>I got this old error on my old laptop with HL2 and GMod.  I could either reboot the computer (cleans stuff out of your RAM) or lower the screen resolution and the problem would be solved.  Just try lowering your resolution to 640x480 (or some x480 res), get through the problematic area, set it back up to whatever it was before.</p>
