    <title>Sudden failiure to launch game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sudden-failiure-to-launch-game/11907</link>
    <description>So I have been playing this game again, and it has been very good and a bit of nostalgia. Except for some black outs a few parts of the game (can walk and shoot, but see nothing when dropping down a ladder etc.) fixed that by playing about around with the videoquality settings. 

but now a week or so ago, when I was launching the .exe  it goes to loading for a bit, then just terminate without any error message back to deskop. This happened virtually over night. I dont think it has anything to do with my software or updates there. But if it is, thanks for the help. I dont have running realtime anti-virus and windows (xp) updates are not automatic. so its not that.

also I might add I remember the last session of playing ended / saved without problems when I shut down. THough the colours went all crazy in the graphics for some parts of the scenery (shafts, light in roof, buttons etc) the colouring went all psychedelic rainbowy. could still play but saved and stopped playing after about 5 minutes of this.

also, yeah, I play a non-steam version (un-official) ... but hope to still find a common denominator for a fix</description>

            <p>I seem to recall that the dropouts and “crazy” graphics are the result of a video card that cannot handle certain shaders.  Try to play around with the options under “Visual”.  First try disabling the noise shader to see if that helps.  Otherwise, try different combinations of the three options under “Visual” to see if that helps.</p>
