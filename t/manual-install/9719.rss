    <title>Manual Install?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/manual-install/9719</link>
    <description>I want to install the mod (it looks fantastic) and so I downloaded the 7z archive and the installer. However, when I run the installer it starts extracting the archive and all to my default drive (D:\) but I barely have any space on D: because it&#39;s a very small partition I only use to run Windows. So there is no room for a huge archive to be extracted to D:, even temporarily. So I went into the 7z archive in WinRAR and I wonder how I might go about installing it that way? I see no EXEs or anything so is it really all in the archive? I just need some kind of way to install it on my storage drive myself.</description>

            <p>Go here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods<br>
create a folder called BMS then put all of the files inside the BMS folder from the .7z then restart steam, Black Mesa should appear in your library.</p>
