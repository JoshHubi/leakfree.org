    <title>No direct debit/withdrawal via PayPal?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-direct-debit-withdrawal-via-paypal/5434</link>
    <description>I was trying to buy &quot;Garry&#39;s Mod&quot; via PayPal, but it seems they only accept credit cards?!
Did any of you have that problem last time you bought something over Steam?
My account is verified and all that shit.

Thanks in advance</description>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">Well… shit:</span></p>
<p>We are aware of this issue and are working with PayPal to determine a resolution.</p>
<p>Until the issue has been resolved by PayPal, please proceed by adding sufficient funds to your PayPal account before attempting to complete purchases through Steam with PayPal.</p>
<p>If your PayPal account contains sufficient funds (including funds to cover VAT, as applicable) you will be able to complete the purchase without adding credit card details.</p>
<p>No big problem, but somehow makes PayPal useless if I have to go to the bank anyway.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the answers, I’ll try.<br>
I think asking both supports won’t help, but I did it anyway.</p>

            <p>Your debit card should work on paypal just like a credit card provided it’s not an ATM card or something like that. They should also support direct withdrawal from your account provided it’s linked through paypal as Fire said.</p>

            <p>Most debit cards can “act” like a credit card. Try linking your card as well as your bank account. Right now my paypal falls back to my card if a transaction doesn’t support account withdraw.</p>
<p>I have used both cards and paypal on steam no problem. Last game I bought from them was during there super summer sale.</p>
