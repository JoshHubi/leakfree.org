    <title>Collapse Film Documentary</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/collapse-film-documentary/6093</link>
    <description>I attempted a search to see if anyone touched on this film but, to no avail.
 
  First off here is a link should you want to know facts about the film without reading through the thread. [url]https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1503769/[/url]

  This is a film directed by Chris Smith who directed The Yes Men and American Movie. 

   Bottom line Micheal Ruppert (according to the film) has done 30 years of research about Peak Oil points and that we as a world have gone past our peak oil point. We will never have as much oil as we did at the time we hit peak oil and will only continue to run out as time moves forward. Ruppert claims that everything in today&#39;s society is made of oil and when oil becomes scarce prices will go through the roof causing a mass world wide economy break down. 

   The film and reviews of the film go more in depth. But check it out. I think that it is over the top but I do see some truth in it. I believe the peak oil BS but I don&#39;t believe what Ruppert said about the collapse of the world happening within the next couple years being the case. You would think that top researchers and people that have been to graduate school would have done the math to know we still have time to harness sun and wind power by the time we run out of black gold. 

   What do you guys think if you even care to mention?</description>

            <p>Shit, sorry about the repost. I didn’t think to search peak oil in the search field. I just searched Collapse. Oh well, I just wanted to see what others thought. Mainly I was hoping for links to solid “internet” facts that would make this guy look like a drama queen. Yeah, some of what he says is true but at the same time not as severe I think of how he talks of it. Again, sorry about the repeat thread.</p>

            <p>I saw it when it came out, full of bullshit and scare propaganda.</p>
<p>The only thing in the movie that makes sense is when they say “if the population skyrockets, it must eventually go back to normal” that I agree with, but it will take more than 100 years from now.</p>
