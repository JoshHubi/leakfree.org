    <description>What&#39;s the best, or some of the best games you&#39;ve ever played.
Hopefully people can find some new interests and games to try out, or maybe start some debates.

FFVII - Not even going to rant about this one.

Superbrothers Sword and Sworcsorry EP - When I bought this game I really didn&#39;t expect much, but it exceeded my expectations and then some. The gameplay, story, art, and music are all put together flawlessly. I can&#39;t really describe it you should try it for your self.

Xenogears(PSX) - I never really got to finish this one(my disk broke), but the gameplay and story were superb. The combat system was the first of it&#39;s time(correct me if I&#39;m wrong). 

Battlefield 3 - Despite what some people say this game will always have a special play in my library.

Battlefield 2
Bad Company 2

Counter - Strike 1.6 and Source : even though the hit boxes are complete shit sometimes, I&#39;ve clocked alot of hours into gun game.

Jade Cocoon(PSX) - Just Imagine a cooler more mature version of Pokemon. Again I can&#39;t describe it, something you should experience your self.

The Halo Series - I know some of you are against Halo and what-not I love the game and it&#39;s changed console gaming.

There are craptons more I can think of, but I won&#39;t cram it into one post.</description>

            <p>^ I actually prefer the Daniel Craig bond to Pierce Brosnan. Craig’s performance more closely mirrors his characterization in the original books. In the books he’s a bit more of a brute than his traditionally suave dialog in the movies would suggest. There were quite a few things that went wrong in the Golden Eye remake- the addition of Craig and the changes to the story were not for the worse, in my book.</p>
<p>The level design is what needed work the most for me. Too linear, too COD-like. And silly quick time events.</p>

<p>agreed, I gave into the hype believing it would be a faithful remake, but instead if was “CODified”</p>

            <p>Super Mario Bros 1, 2 (aka Doki Doki Panic), 3, World, All-Stars, and 64 (haven’t played the others).  I was actually obsessed with SMB2 (DDP) as a youngster.  I loved all the new characters and Nintendo had put out some wall art (large wall decals) of various characters.  Had a picture of Mouser above the head of my bed for over a year.  It was awesome.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>EDIT: I also enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank series of games.  Great voice acting in those games.  And, I’m not sure if it counts because HL doesn’t count, but Portal and Portal 2.</p>

            <p>I think I’ll split mine up into genres, maybe it’ll whittle the list down a bit.</p>
<p>Best Multiplayer FPS - TF2, Counter-Strike series a close second. No other games seem to be quite as addictive to me, though Tribes: Ascend has a pretty strong hold too.</p>
<p>Best Single Player FPS - Half-Life series, but since it doesn’t count, STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl. The atmosphere of the game is unparalleled IMO. Also Deus Ex and HR, if you can count them as just FPS games.</p>
<p>Best Platformer - Megaman X. Egoraptor even has a video on just why it was such a genius game.</p>
<p>Best Western RPG - Mass Effect series. Despite the annoyances of some minigames, and the controversy about the ending, it hardly dampens how great an experience carrying your character on an epic quest through three games with companions you can actually care about is.</p>
<p>Best JRPG - This one is tough, but I think Chrono Trigger is probably my favorite. FFX and Tales of Symphonia are close behind.</p>
<p>Best RTS - Age of Empires 2. I still play this game on LAN with my friends. It’s just…awesome. Starcraft 2 is also a strong contender.</p>
<p>Best Adventure Game - Zelda series. Each one is fun and memorable despite them being quite similar.</p>

            <p>Both Thiefs, System Shock 2, and Deus Ex.</p>
<p>Big immersive sim fan (System Shock 1 and the UU games are great too, but they have major control and interface issues that keep them out of the pantheon).</p>
<p>And of those, Deus Ex is my favorite by a slight margin.</p>

            <p>Half-Life doesn’t count?</p>
<p>Well then, HL2: Episode 2, Mass Effect series, Knights of the Old Republic, Max Payne 2, Arkham games, Marshmallow Duel, Jedi Outcast/Academy*, Portal series, Team Fortress 2, and HodgeN’Podge.</p>
<p>I think I got me favorites…</p>
<p>*I dislike Jedi Academy by itself, but I’ve spent more time modding and playing mods of that game than I’ve spent actually playing any other game, so I feel I have to list it as a favorite.</p>
