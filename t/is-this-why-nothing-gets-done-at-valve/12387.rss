    <description>Check out this story from a fired Valve employee:

What do you think? Do you think Valve&#39;s famous &quot;dream-job&quot; environment might actually be hindering their work? Was it a mistake to not establish an official management system and allow an unofficial one develop?! WILL WE EVER SEE HALF LIFE 3???</description>

            <p>Obviously the current employees of a company aren’t always going to go public with things like that. It makes sense for someone to after they’ve been fired because they no longer have the job to lose! I believe it’s probably not as bad as she says, but that it’s also at least somewhat based on the truth. Also it does sound very similar to some of the things I’ve read about the development of HL2.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that’s true. You’d think if it was as big of a problem as she makes it out to be, alot of people would stand up with her about it, but she’s the only one saying anything. I still think that the whole no boss thing might not be doing Valve very good, but it seems as though alot of it has been blown out of proportion.</p>

            <p>She’s going around bitching that valve is a bunch of assholes but everyone else at valve seems to be fine.  Out of a few hundred employees one of them has major problems with it and that’s supposed to mean there is a problem with it?</p>

            <p>To me it sounds like perhaps she wasn’t getting along very well with the other employees, had a bad attitude or something, and after being fired started raging against the company.</p>
<p>But this is all speculation, so I’m not gonna give this much credence until we hear Valve’s side of the story.</p>

<p>I think the fact that we have seen several projects <span class="bbcode-i">other than</span> Half-Life 3 is actually proof that this person is full of shit:</p>

<p>She said her team was starved for resources because the company’s bonus system kept Valve employees glued to very prestigious projects, bonuses that are larger than what they actually earn. Those people only wanted to work on a sure thing, not something risky like augmented reality.</p>

<p>If this were true, all their resources would be devoted to Half-Life and they would have been churning out spinoffs regularly. On the contrary, almost everything Valve has done in the meantime <span class="bbcode-i">has</span> been experimental and risky. Hell, they even hired <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/05/05/valves-experimental-psychologist-discusses-sweat-detection-and-eye-tracking-for-games/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">an experimental psychologist</a>.</p>

            <p>Well, six years later and not even a fart from a next half-life game. Also each time as of late a gaming convention goes by, it’s just “steam business” instead of game announcements or engine presentations. I honestly think they are behind competition, Source 2 is needed at this point and another AAA game soon, since there’s no known project in works currently after Dota 2.</p>

            <p>Probably not, but however close to the truth it is, I’d be interested to see how Valve responds to it.</p>

            <p>Obviously Jeri Ellsworth was spying on Valve from the inside to find the weaknesses so she could afterwards get “fired” and then send all the information to EA so that EA might find a way to destroy Valve and then buy the remains of it once they’ve killed it.</p>

            <p>Check out this story from a fired Valve employee:<br>
<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Valve-Weird-Paranoia-Jeri-Ellsworth-Hardware-Steam,23426.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Valve-Weird-Paranoia-Jeri-Ellsworth-Hardware-Steam,23426.html</a></p>
<p>What do you think? Do you think Valve’s famous “dream-job” environment might actually be hindering their work? Was it a mistake to not establish an official management system and allow an unofficial one develop?! WILL WE EVER SEE HALF LIFE 3???</p>
