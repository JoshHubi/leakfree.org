            <p>I always get this message when I try to connect through my cell phone connection, no matter what app I used: PDAnet, FoxFi and “Wireless Tether for Root users”.</p>
<p>The reason I complain is because when I go to CS non-steam I can see the updated list of servers and can play on them just fine(apart from all the hackers). Only can’t sign in to Steam…</p>

            <p>This what I always do: go to your Steam main directory (typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam) and look for the ClientRegistry.blob file. Delete this file and run Steam (it will have to re-update). Works every time for me.</p>

            <p>considering this forum is the first result on a google search of “to run steam you must first connect to the internet” I thought I would post the fix that worked for me - even though it is an old thread.</p>
<p>I am using a Billion BiPac 7404VGOX and I had to change the firewall general policy here:</p>
<p>Configuration<br>
-Firewall<br>
-General Settings<br>
-Policy (changed from Medium security level to Low security level)</p>
<p>Hope it helps someone else.</p>
