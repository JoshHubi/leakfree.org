    <description>Hi guys,

I have a question again.. I hope you can help me. I created a texture for my crossfire map. This time the helipads-texture. I wanted to make a decal with the paintings and transparent background to place it on the helipads and have really well scaled concrete-floor texture below the decal. My question is.. How can I create and save alpha channels (using photoshop CS5) into a .tga file? I will use VTFedit to convert the .tga to a material file afterwards. So far I could not manage to save the alpha channels into the tga. Or atleast they aren&#39;t transparent when loaded in Hammer. When I go to &quot;channels&quot; in photoshop, i already have a channel called alpha. I can see that the non-tansparent parts are drawn white on that channel. The tansparent parts are black... So.. Can I save this alpha channel using photoshop or do I need a different program? I downloaded gimp now. If I can do it with gimp, how do I have to do it?

Thx for any help  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Go to your channels tab and make sure you have a r, g, b and alpha channels there. Next make sure you have a grayscale (black and white) layer in it. Then when you save your tga it HAS to be saved as a 32bit tga or your alpha channel won’t be saved.</p>

            <p>Ok very much thanks for your tips again  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I used photoshop’s export feature this time (clicked render video and made it 1 frame in .tga format) and it saved the alpha channel. Then I put $translucent 1 in the .vmt and it worked. Thx a lot!</p>

            <p>Sounds like your image itself is fine. The alpha channel is part of the image, as long as you export as pretty much anything other than JPG, should be fine.</p>
<p>Ensure you’re using the DXT5 VTF format, and that you’re enabling the $translucent parameter in your VMT.</p>
