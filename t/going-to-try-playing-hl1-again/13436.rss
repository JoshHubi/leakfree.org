    <title>Going to try playing HL1 again</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/going-to-try-playing-hl1-again/13436</link>
    <description>I tried playing Half-Life Source and didn&#39;t much care for it. I&#39;m heavily considering playing through Half-Life 1 (I haven&#39;t finished Black Mesa yet, either). From what I can gather, the HD pack is standard, but should I download any graphical mods that enhance HL1&#39;s look further, such as Super Definition, Half-Life Overhaul, or DiamondD? All mods I mentioned can be found here: [url]https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1445333[/url]

EDIT: Forget Overhaul and DiamondD, I don&#39;t like how they look. But would anyone recommend Super Definition?</description>

            <p>TFC gave me a strong preference for the LD HEV arms. They make the suit feel rubbery, in a good way, like how stormtroopers evoke a sense of plastic.</p>

            <p>The HD models were kinda ugly, I agree. Most games from that era have visually similar, similarly ugly models.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’m pretty much set on going stock. I don’t really like the HD models. I just wish the stock crowbar was a bit smoother, but otherwise everything still looks really good.</p>

            <p>I always found the HD models for the NPC’s (primarily the scientists and guards) to be rather cartoonish. The HD pack looks ok otherwise to me.</p>

            <p>Honestly, the HD one looked just as bad if not worse. Waaaay too thick.</p>

            <p>The one thing I hate about the “high definition” pack, is that the submachine gun is a rifle. Like an m4 or something… I don’t like that. makes less sense and it just looks awkward.</p>

            <p>I do actually like the original models. I just don’t like the old crowbar. I’m either going with completely stock or Super Def.</p>

            <p>I personally prefer to play with no graphical mods… I like all the original models better. I can’t tell if that’s just nostalgia talking or not. But I think you should go with the authentic HL experience…</p>

            <p>The super definition pack as far as I can tell is all official models taken directly from the Playstation 2 version of Half-Life, it’s basically a very much enhanced version of the original HD pack. I prefer the Super Definition pack to the HD pack because I think it looks much nicer.</p>

            <p>You can check <a href="https://old.ambientimpact.com/downloads.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">these</a> <a href="https://www.hitmodel.half-lifecreations.com/filedb/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">pages</a> to cherry-pick models to your liking, and use the standard HD pack to fill in any gaps.</p>
<p>Or, if you’d prefer to original aesthetics, the HD pack is toggleable with the current version of HL - you can turn it off in the video tab of the options menu. They’re by no means an eyesore in my opinion, just not as shiny as modern games.</p>
