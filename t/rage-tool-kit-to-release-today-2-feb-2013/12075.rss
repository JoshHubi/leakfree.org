    <title>RAGE Tool Kit to Release Today. 2 Feb. 2013</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rage-tool-kit-to-release-today-2-feb-2013/12075</link>
    <description>The guys over at id Software are planning to release their dev kit for RAGE today on Steam. According to the Bethesda blog, the kit is a hefty 35gb large and will be available later today.

Now, I&#39;m not sure if this is just a barebones modding kit or what, but I&#39;m one of those few people who supports id Tech 5 and who thought that RAGE was a beautiful game, so I&#39;m hoping this tool will show people what else id Tech 5 can do and that it&#39;s not 100% deserving of the bad rep it gets.</description>

            <p>God, I WISH Rockstar would release a Rockstar Advanced Game Engine toolkit. That would be a superpowerful tool in the hands of modders.</p>
