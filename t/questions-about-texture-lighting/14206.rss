    <description>Hey guys.
I am still working on my own version of crossfire. I&#39;m almost done, but I have wierd problems with the texture lights.
my .vmt:


&quot;LightmappedGeneric&quot;
{
 &quot;$basetexture&quot; &quot;dm_pro_crossfire/+0~fifties_lgt2&quot;
 &quot;$surfaceprop&quot; &quot;glass&quot;
 &quot;$selfillum&quot; 1
}

my lights.rad (in bms folder):

dm_pro_crossfire/+0~fifties_lgt2 160 170 220 400

I often use lightmapsize 8.
Sometimes I want my lambs to be not solid (so I make them func_illusionary)..

When I compile and go in game my lamb texture is not fully lit (it should glow because I set &quot;$selfillum&quot; 1 right?)..
What am I doing wrong? Do I need to use a certain value for the lightmapsize? Do I need to have my blocks to be world geometry (no entity)? Or are there any other things that I should care about?
I read some tutorials online but somehow it did not help :/ -.-
I have one lamb in my map where the whole block (atm it&#39;s func_brush) is completely black ingame (totally unlit?) although I can see the light coming out of the texlight surface... So strange... :/
Help pls ...</description>

            <p>Alright… Thx for all the quick answers and information. I think I will try out some things tomorrow…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Don’t use func_illusionary, it’s a defunct entity. You should never use it. Use func_brush with the solidity set to never solid. The issue, as Crypt said, is probably that the texture is set to lightmappedgeneric. If that doesn’t work, compare it to a working example of a texture light which does work in BMS, and try and fix the difference.</p>

            <p>First off, thank you for using func_illusionary.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/thumbsup.png?v=9" title=":thumbsup:" class="emoji" alt=":thumbsup:"></p>
<p>Anyway, lightmap size isn’t causing your issue, but I suggest you read up on what they are and how to use them anyway, it sounds you don’t understand them and that could cause you issues later.<br>
It being a brush ent also probably isn’t at fault.</p>
<p>I’d try setting its shader to UnlitGeneric and seeing if that fixes it.</p>
<p>If <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> doesn’t work, since everything else sounds right, what my first guess would be is your texture’s alpha channel. If there’s no normal map or defined mask texture, $selfillum by default uses the image’s alpha channel when figuring what pixels should be how strong in its self-illumination. Are you exporting your image w/ an alpha channel, and using a VTF format that uses it (DXT5, BRGA8888, etc.)? If so, it could be reading it as all dark, and blacking it out.</p>
<p>Also, personally I wouldn’t use a texlight for them, those are kinda sucky in Source (awesome in GoldSrc, though). Just the self-illumination.</p>
