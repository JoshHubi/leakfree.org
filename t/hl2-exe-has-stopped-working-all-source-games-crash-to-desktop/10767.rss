    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-exe-has-stopped-working-all-source-games-crash-to-desktop/10767</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been searching the internet and i have no idea what to do. It seems all my games on steam crash to desktop.

csgo.exe does the same.
Blackmesa crashes to desktop also.

I&#39;ve has uninstalled and re installed several times, updated graphic drivers and changed settings such as multi-core rendering. I&#39;ve even updated my BIOS.

I&#39;m lost. I have no idea what a solution is.

Specs;
i5 running at 4.4GHz
GA-Z77-D3H
8GB Ram
Nvidia 560ti

If anyone could help i would be grateful.</description>
