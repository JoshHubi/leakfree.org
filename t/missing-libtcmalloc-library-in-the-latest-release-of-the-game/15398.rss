    <title>Missing libtcmalloc library in the latest release of the game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/missing-libtcmalloc-library-in-the-latest-release-of-the-game/15398</link>
    <description>It appears that the libtcmalloc library is missing from either not compiling with it before release or because it&#39;s missing from the bin directory. When I try to run the command [tt]./bms_linux[/tt] in the terminal I just get the message

[code]
/home/pingu/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Black Mesa/bms_linux: error while loading shared libraries: libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[/code]
I think a quick patch with libtcmalloc may be needed soon.</description>

            <p>I’ll go ahead and test that out real quick. I’ll edit this reply when I get back to it.</p>
<p>So yeah, it did run in the public beta branch. I need to try out multiplayer but so far so good.</p>

            <p>I think the beta branch already has it. I wish they would do at least a minor update on the main branch for Linux.</p>
