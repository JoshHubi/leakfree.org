    <title>Upgrading to Windows 7 - Quick Question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/upgrading-to-windows-7-quick-question/5119</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to be upgrading from Windows Vista Home Premium to Windows 7 Professional, but from everywhere I&#39;ve read that would require a clean installation. However none of those specify if that requires a full version to do a clean install. Is is possible just to buy an Upgrade/ System Builder version of  Professional, or am I going to have to buy the full version of Professional to do the clean install?</description>

            <p>Get the OEM (full) version of Win7 Pro and do a clean install.  Save yourself lots-o-money.  Just remember to save any old hardware (Vista) PC drivers/CDs for use in loading Win7.  Once all h/w is recognized in 7, then just update drivers online.</p>
<p>Better yet, get a new larger HDD (just make sure your HDD controller can handle partitions &gt;137GB if IDE drive, no problems going 1TB if SATA) and swap out the Vista HDD and install Win7 fresh on new HDD.  If any h/w is not recognized, then you can always swap back.  If all goes well, install the old drive as a slave and copy over your data files. Then wipe the old drive and use it for additional storage in Win7.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, while you’re at it, you may want to upgrade the memory to at least 2GB.</p>

            <p>Upgrades sometimes get messy. Just backup your important files and do a clean install. Less chance of shit happening in the long run.</p>
<p>And you get some extra free space.</p>

            <p>As long as you own a copy of windows currently you can use an upgrade disk for either an “in-place” upgrade or a clean install.</p>
<p>Like sersoft said, if you’re upgrading from 32-bit to 32-bit or 64-bit to 64-bit you can use the “in-place” option and keep most of your programs, documents, and settings. Otherwise you’ll have to back everything up and do a clean install.</p>

            <p>if you have the right type of license and the same CPU type (x64/32bit) you can do an upgrade that keeps all your programs and most of your settings.</p>
