    <title>Problem with houndeyes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-with-houndeyes/62090</link>
    <description>So a while back I noticed that my houndeyes did not have the constant &quot;glow&quot; on their backs and appeared only when attacking. I have no mods, I have re-installed the game multiple times and nothing changed.

I am very confused with this and any help would be appreciated!
I will leave some specs here in case its any help.
