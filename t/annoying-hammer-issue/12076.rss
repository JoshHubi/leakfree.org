    <title>Annoying Hammer Issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/annoying-hammer-issue/12076</link>
    <description>I recently got a used gaming laptop and have been pretty happy with being able to play games while staying portable. Problem is, Hammer&#39;s been giving me grief. It seems that while trying to select something in the 3D view, it always goes right through the object I attempt to select and instead selects the last object before blackness. For example, if I have two brushes right next to each other, and I try to select one at an angle that has the other behind it, it will select the one behind it. I fear that it is a graphics driver issue, with all I&#39;ve heard about AMD cards. (I can adapt to the scrambled text issue, but broken 3D selection is unbearable.) Can anybody lend a hand?

[b]EDIT: Just emailed Mike Durand about the issue, awaiting response.[/b] Update: I didn&#39;t get a response.

            <p>When you click on the first brush, does it cycle through selecting each brush in order? Or does it immediately select the last brush? The former could easily be a glitch with hammer or something as simple as a sticky mouse button.</p>
