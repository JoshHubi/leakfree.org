    <description>I finished the game HL1, BM: S and I would play again, great job.
I came up with the idea as long as you have the time and desire, you would add the HL Uplink as an additional episode.</description>

            <p>Nerus, what a coincidence!  I just came up with the idea that YOU could create Black Mesa Uplink.  Roll up your sleeves buddy! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>In all seriousness, the developers have stated many times that they do not desire to re-create the Hazard Course, Uplink, Blue Shift, Opposing Force and/or Decay.  And why would they?  Thereâ€™s a good reason all of those were less popular than the original Half Life. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
