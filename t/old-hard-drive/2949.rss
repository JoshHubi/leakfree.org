    <title>Old Hard-drive</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/old-hard-drive/2949</link>
    <description>Ok, I was having problems with my computer ([url]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=3623[/url]) and I think it&#39;s the graphics card that was broken, so I was wondering:

Should the Hard-Drive still be usable in a new computer so I don&#39;t lose anything or should I still buy a new Hard-Drive and use this one as a second drive to restore anything I might want on it?

I&#39;m thinking of building a new computer instead of just buying a pre-made one, so I&#39;ll probably have a few more questions in the process. So ya... please be patient with any idiotic statements I make.</description>

<p>Depends really, old hard drives are useful for backing up important data on.</p>

<p>I feel you. My old computer had a 250 GB that the mobo could only read 136 of. Now I have a 640 in this new one, and I can’t see myself without that much space.</p>

<p>If you’ve barely had any issues moving a drive with an OEM Windows installation (transferring a retail license is a little different) or with clashing drivers, then you might want to work on a couple dozen more.</p>

            <p>Hmm…</p>
<p>I might still look into a new Driver because my current one appears to be a 250gb and it looks like you can get a lot bigger and more efficient ones pretty cheap.</p>

            <p>Ok, so when using new Hardware it’s best to just start clean. Thanks!</p>
<p><em>does some search</em><br>
Whoa, aimed too high. The first one I found was like $200. Found some cheaper ones, though.</p>

<p>Windows OEM installations might get a little pissy if you try booting with different hardware. New, high-capacity hard drives are relatively cheap nowadays, so if you’re planning on building a new computer, you’d might as well get one. If your old drive is 320GB or less, you might even notice increased performance due to newer drives’ higher data density.</p>

<p>This.</p>
<p>RabidMonkey gave me his old tower minus the hard drive. I put in my hard drive but because the rest of the tower was WAY different than the operating system remembered upon its last boot, it wigged out.</p>
<p>Spend the $60 bucks and get a new hard drive for your basics, and use your old hard drive as a secondary for your play stuff.</p>
<p>WAY way worth it. I was up and running faster than I thought I would be.</p>

            <p>It’s not the price I’m worried about, mostly it’s the inconvenience of getting a new gaming rig and having to reinstall everything and losing all those save files as well as anything else that may have been on it.</p>
<p>So might as well just buy a new Hard-Drive and not worry about anything on this one or is there a way to get off any of the files I would rather not lose?</p>
