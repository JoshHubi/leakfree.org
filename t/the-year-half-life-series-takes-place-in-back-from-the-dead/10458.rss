    <title>The year Half Life series takes place in (back from the dead)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-year-half-life-series-takes-place-in-back-from-the-dead/10458</link>
    <description>before the [color=red][i][b][u]Purging of the Threads[/i][/b][/u][/size], i made a thread regarding the lore behind the &quot;year&quot; half life is set in, now its back and will be expanded upon

The general reference point is half life 1, which is set in [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]2003 (according to this: [url]https://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100213053821/half-life/en/images/1/14/Rtb_laidlaw_note.jpg[/url]), although many simply call it [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]&quot;200x or 200-,&quot;    but i like the idea of half life being set in [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]2003 (especially when it was released in 1998 ) because it reflects on the environment in half life (like how the scientists utilyze 90&#39;s/2000&#39;s-ish technology like VHS tapes, windows 95/98/2000 computers, tape mainframes etc.)

The information listed below is relative to half life&#39;s presumed [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]2003 setting:

-Gordon is 27 years old, and is born [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]&quot;between 1973 and 1982&quot; according to valve; 2003-27= [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]1976; [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]1976 falls perfectly between [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]1973 and 1982
so assuming half life is set in [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]2003, Gordon is born in [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]1976!

-Adrian Shepard is 22 years old and is born [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]&quot;between 1978 and 1987&quot;; 2003-22= [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]1981, which once again falls within the estimated years

-it is of note that the years these characters are born have a difference of 9 ([COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]1982-1973= 9 for gordon; [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]1987-1978= 9 for shepard; 200x which signifies years between 2000-200[COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]9, same applies for hl2&#39;s estimated timeline of 202x, which would be between 2020-202[color=orange]9) the same pattern applies for the estimated birth dates of Gina cross and Collette green (which are not listed)

so if half life really is set in [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]2003, then that means half life 2 takes place in march/may [COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]2023 (the months have had rectons so its hard to distinguish between march or may)

[u][b]*post-blackmesa reflection[/b][/u]
BMS really does portray the early 2000&#39;s pretty well in my opinion, the flatscreens around the facility make a keen reference to SONY (which was probally the most common type of TV, electronic etc. brand at the timeperiod IRL), under the name of FONY
BMS also (coincidentally?) portrays the computers as old windows 95&#39;s

the Questionable Ethics chapter was the best part of such portral imo, the offices felt silent, it just reminds me so much of going to work when noone is in the office, so silent where all you hear are computers, printers and air conditioning......</description>

<p>take into account half life 2 takes place in east europe (my bet is either russia or urkraine, or some country near and/or influenced by russia)<br>
there are alot of russian signs throughout half life 2 and cold war bases (white forest is good example)</p>
<p>i dont think fall would occur over there like in the US</p>

            <p>the commonly accepted date is may 16th, 2003, which is basically what the wiki supports. This means the seven hour war occured, probably, that summer, and then about 20 years of shit goes by, including the events of Portal, and somewhere in the range of 2020 - 2025, Half-Life 2 kicks off.</p>
<p>I can’t confirm this, I haven’t been a Half-Life geek for the past few years, but I do recall that, during Half-Life 2, they had originally intended for it to be 10 years after. It wasn’t until the episodes established a 20 year time period, (due to no opposition from vanilla hl2) that the 20 year gap was made official. Again, no source on that one.</p>

            <p>I’ve compared both the BMS and the Blue Shift calendars to different calendars of 200-2009, and the BMS is from 2000, and Blue shift doesn’t make any sence, both becausde two saturdays/sundays are missing and because there is no 31th December, but if you add that, it’s most similar to the one from either 2003 or 2004, so your theories could be correct.</p>

            <p>before the [color=red]<span class="bbcode-i">[b][u]Purging of the Threads</span>[/b][/u][/size], i made a thread regarding the lore behind the “year” half life is set in, now its back and will be expanded upon</p>
<p>The general reference point is half life 1, which is set in [COLOR=‘Orange’]2003 (according to this: <a href="https://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100213053821/half-life/en/images/1/14/Rtb_laidlaw_note.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100213053821/half-life/en/images/1/14/Rtb_laidlaw_note.jpg</a>), although many simply call it [COLOR=‘Orange’]“200x or 200-,”    but i like the idea of half life being set in [COLOR=‘Orange’]2003 (especially when it was released in 1998 ) because it reflects on the environment in half life (like how the scientists utilyze 90’s/2000’s-ish technology like VHS tapes, windows 95/98/2000 computers, tape mainframes etc.)</p>
<p>The information listed below is relative to half life’s presumed [COLOR=‘Orange’]2003 setting:</p>
<p>-Gordon is 27 years old, and is born [COLOR=‘Orange’]“between 1973 and 1982” according to valve; 2003-27= [COLOR=‘Orange’]1976; [COLOR=‘Orange’]1976 falls perfectly between [COLOR=‘Orange’]1973 and 1982<br>
so assuming half life is set in [COLOR=‘Orange’]2003, Gordon is born in [COLOR=‘Orange’]1976!</p>
<p>-Adrian Shepard is 22 years old and is born [COLOR=‘Orange’]“between 1978 and 1987”; 2003-22= [COLOR=‘Orange’]1981, which once again falls within the estimated years</p>
<p>-it is of note that the years these characters are born have a difference of 9 ([COLOR=‘Orange’]1982-1973= 9 for gordon; [COLOR=‘Orange’]1987-1978= 9 for shepard; 200x which signifies years between 2000-200[COLOR=‘Orange’]9, same applies for hl2’s estimated timeline of 202x, which would be between 2020-202[color=orange]9) the same pattern applies for the estimated birth dates of Gina cross and Collette green (which are not listed)</p>
<p>so if half life really is set in [COLOR=‘Orange’]2003, then that means half life 2 takes place in march/may [COLOR=‘Orange’]2023 (the months have had rectons so its hard to distinguish between march or may)</p>

BMS really does portray the early 2000’s pretty well in my opinion, the flatscreens around the facility make a keen reference to SONY (which was probally the most common type of TV, electronic etc. brand at the timeperiod IRL), under the name of FONY<br>
BMS also (coincidentally?) portrays the computers as old windows 95’s</p>
<p>the Questionable Ethics chapter was the best part of such portral imo, the offices felt silent, it just reminds me so much of going to work when noone is in the office, so silent where all you hear are computers, printers and air conditioning…</p>
