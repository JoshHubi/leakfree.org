    <title>Any networked painting applications?</title>

    <description>Besides open canvas1.1?
I&#39;ve been looking for something decent that doesn&#39;t glitch to shit. Open canvas has been fine, but the networking is too god damn buggy. Random spikes of lag can ruin everything, and when someone joins a session there&#39;s a high chance random scribbles show up everywhere.

Plus I&#39;m just curious. Are there any other painting programs besides open canvas with the same functionality?</description>
