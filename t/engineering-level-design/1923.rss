    <title>Engineering level design</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/engineering-level-design/1923</link>
    <description>I tried to put this in the right place, I don&#39;t start too many topics  :slight_smile: 

This is a question for any level designers out there who are better than me (that would be everyone here then): when designing levels, do you ever think about how they would stay up in real life?

I started studying civil engineering in september, so I spend a lot of time looking at fun old things like construction materials and structural design. I&#39;ve been wondering if thinking about this kind of thing and incorporating it into your level design makes it appear more real? Or is it more likely to get in the way of gameplay? Maybe people would subconsciously accept the level as more believable?

Its a bit rambling, but I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this, especially anyone who thinks about this kind of stuff</description>

<p>Rough out the entire layout of the map with placeholder dev textures (most people call this orangemapping or whiteboxing). You want all of the dimensions to be more or less what you expect (corridor widths and lengths, floor areas for rooms, etc.) and then get all of the crude functional gameplay in (NPCs, a rough nodegraph, doors and elevators, etc.) so you can start testing it, because it’s a lot easier to change things around at this stage. You don’t want to spend a few weeks lighting and detailing your map only to find that you have to redo huge chunks of it because it doesn’t work or it’s not fun.</p>

            <p>I don’t usually have to take this into account, (I do mostly indoor maps/buildings that aren’t above ground level) but I do use supports and such when it makes sense for the athestic part of the level; A large room in an office building would probably have supports somewhere, while a small-ish hallway in a metal space station would not.</p>

<p>Its interesting to see that people do take this into account; I suppose some of the best environments are those that you can accept as so convincing you wouldn’t give them a second thought.

            <p>Yes. Especially when designing levels that are meant to mimic the real-world (and even in other cases such as alien or futuristic architecture), making sure that they are correctly planned architecturally and structurally is very important to making it feel ‘real’ (since a 100-ton concrete platform can’t float, or be supported by a 2 inch thick steel beam in the real world.)</p>
<p>You have to keep a balance with gameplay, though; when the realism starts interfering with the level and making it play poorly, you might have to make some concessions. Gameplay should be first and foremost. You would also need to take into account engine limitations and functions which may get in the way sometimes as well (if I make these walls the same thickness, then it will result in a cleaner leaf split, as opposed to making them separate thicknesses which is more realistic, but results in a messy portal file, etc.)</p>
<p>As the previous posters said, the best idea when working on levels is to seek out reference! I would advise starting an archive folder for any and all reference material you find, to use as a starting-off point when designing something, or to return to if you ever get stuck or need more ideas.</p>

            <p>The answer is absolutely. Personally when I’m designing levels I take a lot of things into consideration…</p>
<p>For instance wall thickness depends on what it’s supposed to be made from. If it’s an outer or supporting wall it will be thicker than a wall simply for dividing two rooms. The best mappers always use real life references from photographs, or buildings they know.</p>
