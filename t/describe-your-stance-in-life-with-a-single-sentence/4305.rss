    <title>Describe your stance in life with a single sentence</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/describe-your-stance-in-life-with-a-single-sentence/4305</link>

<p>I wasn’t referring to you. When I said “all of you” I was referring to eternalness and (to a certain extent) sersoft who go on and on about how they’re baked constantly. It just grinds on my nerves. I don’t care that they smoke, it just gets really fucking old that they go on and on about it.</p>

</aside>
<p>“All of you” kind of implies “all of you,” so I assumed you meant all of us.</p>

<p>This. A thousand times this. I have no interest in smoking pot. I don’t care if it has positive or negative effects, it just really doesn’t appeal to me. But I find it incredibly annoying when all of you pothead fuckstains go around everyday on the forums saying you’re blazed out of your fucking skull and how fucking awesome you are for doing so.</p>

<p>Where do you get the idea that <span class="bbcode-i">everyone</span> who does weed goes on about it constantly? Surely you wouldn’t notice the ones that don’t?</p>
<p>I haven’t mentioned weed any more on this forum than I would hot dogs when I’m hungry, tbh.</p>
