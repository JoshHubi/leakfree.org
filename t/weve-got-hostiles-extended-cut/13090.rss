Ok here goes nothing at the moment. The story so far is that I first wanted to bring the C map a bit closer to the original Half Life this has been completed. I am now moving forward with the Ventilation system from half life Alpha which was cut level / area in Half life. I wanted to add both more sound and visuals to the original stock map and make it so that the HECU would run on your position in the warehouse and I have achieved this amongst giving more depth to the scenery and showing the artillery on the cliffs firing upon the area. I also wanted to allow the player to perciieve that they were attempting to escape at this point and allow them to experience the escape attempt if they should so wish. I also wanted to bring the Main ventilation shaft closer to the original Half Life but also I ended up redesigning the look of the Bunker that leads into it taking cues from both Half Life and Black Mesa and adding my own slant on it. But I really did not want to alter the core intension of the original mappers vision if only to alter it slightly and if you like It&#39;s a reply to his vision and showing him my vision. But I have to think the original Mapper done a great job with the Chapter as It is one of my favorites. 

External content credits:- 
&quot;Citizen_001&quot; for the artillery model aesthetic only
Mortar particles :- re-purposed &quot;vman&quot; explosion for the mortar particles
Valve for HL2 textures
Black Mesa for the wonderful playground.

The next stage in this development process is to extend this map whilst restoring the vent shaft in the original Half life and fill in the gaps of how the ventilation system got heavily cut in Half Life.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Basic Premise

I am more or less at the final initial planning stages of an extended cut of we&#39;ve got hostiles.

It was perhaps one of the best chapters from Black Mesa. RK a community forum member here did a good job of adding back some of the vent maze that got cut. And I really liked what he did.

For this project though I am planning to draw influence from the original Half life / Half life Alpha / Half Life Chronicles episode 1 and Black Mesa and bring it all together to try and make and extended cut and try and tell a bit more story in the process.

The basic premise I have in mind is as follows.

The vent shaft with the fans as a death trap (Half life)
Leading to Vent system Room (alpha)
Leading to a Train station with Freight (new / chronicles / Black Mesa)
Train Journey Leading to the dormitories or other area (chronicles / Black Mesa)
Looping back on to The first map in we&#39;ve got hostiles (Half life / Black Mesa)

What do you think of this premise is this something you would like to see?

Any fans of chronicles have any ideas about integrating story elements, one thought that springs to mind are the blueprints on the table and the compromised security station perhaps where they are making the vox announcements from. But this won&#39;t be an alternate reality like chronicles it must be integrated. Most of chronicles will not be mapped but I am not adverse to moving bits of it about.

I will not be having the osprey crash or the entrance the other side of the [u]electric fence[/u] but I might include the gate just for show.

Yes the dormitories station and we&#39;ve got hostiles line up they are next to one another. So I have checked this before posting.

Anyway I generally have what I want to do in mind but I thought I would see what people think of the premise of the idea.</description>

            <p>As long as you have Black Mesa you can download it from page 1 first post in this thread and put the files into you BMS directory and it will work. But that is only the stock remix of the 3rd map in WGH currently which is the same length as the normal map more or less it’s slightly expanded … Everything else is going to come at a later time.</p>
<p>Try this first and then try vent Mod in the meantime while I am on shutdown</p>
<p>I also need peoples opinions and help… Yes I am a human and I need alternative points of view… Or am I slipping down a vent shaft?</p>

            <p>Just to let people know that i have not forgotten about this but that development is currently halted while i am too busy with work. I plan to recommence development in end of july or august.</p>
<p>So sorry ran out of spare time until then but if you have any thoughts at all about we’ve got hostiles or the alpha security complex content i would be happy to hear them before i start up again on this.</p>
<p>I have also made a minor change to the B map and retextured the lift shaft and added the audio line “Heads up we got a hostile” in the correct place that it is heard. I also have a sign ready to add for surface access which is missing from Black Mesa. But you won’t get this until a much later time when i get the expansion underway proper</p>

            <p>Hi,  I am using the other one,  the Vent Mod,  now what would happen if I’d install the most recent version of this shiny mod?  It would be a dead end , a crash, or massive nuclear meltdown?</p>

            <p>I think that i will link to vent mod first. and get this part out the way. I want to encourage people to also try out what you did and then the next release will be a mod of vent mod. replacement c map.</p>
<p>Then when i do the chronicles section that will be the last phase of the project. where it will be a stand alone mod and i will also then edit the a map to link.</p>
<p>But because I am somewhat making it up as I go along I may be able to include a part from chronicles in this. It’s very much going to be a suck it and see. And I never planned to map the whole of chronicles either only the very first part and the tram ride. so like I said I’ll have to wait and see what heppens. But I doubt there is space for the tram ride in this map. But that also was never going to be very long either.</p>

            <p>You might want to just keep your whole mod in one map if you’re going to pursue linking your map with Vent Mod’s A map, and the reason being is because of how level transitions work.</p>
<p>Both maps have to reference each other. Ergo, if you suddenly make a D map, Vent Mod’s A map will not reference it. You wouldn’t be able to do such a thing without packaging your own version of the A map (which regardless of whether or not you just package the stock version of A or you take whatever you need from Vent Mod A, will cause problems).</p>
<p>And of course if you’re just making alterations to C and intend to have <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> hook up to Vent Mod’s A, you should also make a version of C that links to the stock A, because potentially your playerbase may not have Vent Mod installed.</p>

<p>So it has begun, and I am now starting to get excited, I hope you folks are too because this is the main reason why I started this project in the first place and it feels good to be here at last.</p>
<p>I made quite a big post above but I bumped this in hope of getting some peoples thoughts on the above post. But if nothing comes I guess nobody really missed this room?</p>
<p>Theres a couple of other things that I am going to share at this time.</p>
<p>This is a long way off yet and I am using RK vent mod as a basis for it. not because I want to copy his work but because I am sure my spacial awareness skills are nowhere near his so I am planning to link in to vent mod at exactly the same point as RK’s map does but for the map to be completely different in terms of layout and what you will see and what will happen. all that will be used from Vent mod will be the level transition in the same place.</p>
<p>That has it’s complications as this room is not next in RK’s map but it will be in mine so that makes things a bit difficult sort of. Another thing to note is that I am undecided as to wether or not load in a whole new map and do the whole extension that I have planned in one map so it’s all a bit up in the air at this point. as I do believe I could squeeze it all into one new map for the chapter. but if I do the whole “new map option” I plan to transition back in quite a different place to the first map in WGH so It’s all a bit ??? at the moment but I am doing this like this for good reason as I keep my option open at this time.</p>

            <p>The Map now effectively in terms of how I had to alter it to get it working is a large Bucket with the lid on it  the surface section became about just over a third larger had to box in huge swathes of sky to get it to compile. I used Visclusters on the displacements areas 3 in total but I will definitley be adding one up there when I get to it. Thanks a lot for your support RK.</p>
<p>Here is some of what I plan to be drawing inspiration upon for the next section. But without altering the very next room in terms of geometry. Well I am fibbing a bit but I am not letting any cats out of any bags of what I have planned next for the very next section.</p>

<p>Also a quuestion about this.</p>
<p>Is this cut content? It’s a map of the surface in WGH</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/a/0/a02b68a51996550429bff812e0b9d4ecadcb5de5.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="mQVoGpLgyDzWU1ZfOTkNBvGsacR" width="256" height="256"></p>
<p>I have started putting the geometry together more in my head than in hammer for this next section. I am planning on having two shafts currently as an air in flow and air out flow. I thought more people would find the premise of the cut ventilation system a lot more exciting than a zero set of opinions on it so far. Don’t worry it won’t be boring that is something I don’t do boring. The very next room will be the cut shaft from Half life this will branch off to and be around the ventilation system. But it won’t be a massive expansion, it will probably go fairly quick and swift but slower than the bombing of the surface section. The very next room has been started on mapping wise also. There will not be any flooded warehouse with Bullsquids I can tell you that now.</p>
<p>One more thing to note is the key cards, that got cut that seemed to be planned for this area I am not to sure if that is something that I will be including but you may see a reference to key cards in the level for nostalgia purposes. are key cards boring fetch quests or are they charming old school game play? would you like to see the keycard mechanic return for a single door? Black mesa also included a reference to it… I just wondering should I try to do this.</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/a/e/aefe7daa10f5c5ce5042d55740c7390d83897cf9.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="oY4k5DcGMUxzzWLCrPS6SdtHkX7" width="433" height="345"></p>
<p>I want some ideas on thoughts about how “security Complex” became “We’ve got Hostiles” and how the Ventilation system got cut quite heavily. It’s a grey area that allows for creative freedom but there also has to be an element of planning that any Alpha content that is included is done in a reverse way of thinking as the alpha ventilation system was the B map or 2nd map in we’ve got hostiles before the drastic alterations that were made. But It also calls for not veering away too heavily from being in the ventilalation system and not running around other large areas it needs to be focused on the ventilation areas and not so much about anything else.</p>
<p>As RK has shown with vent Mod the maps in the original game make no sense what so ever and neither do they in Black Mesa in terms of spacial awareness. My thoughts are that it did make sense at one time but when the drastic alterations happened this affected the layout and stuff got lost that was originally planned. But with that said the alpha was the B map which was still heading to the surface but in this version it will be the way back doiwn through the ventilation system. Keeping closer to the original Half Life game.</p>
<p>Please give us your thoughts on back engineering “security Complex” back in to We’ve got Hostiles. and solving this Jigsaw puzzle.</p>

<p>the reason why it was crashing was incredibly stupid and dumb.</p>
<p>The extended version will feature a few minor tweaks to this map though as I have just picked up on a few things I missed.</p>
<p>Please also if you download tell us what you thought of it, it does not mean I will change anything but I will happily take opinions in to consideration.</p>
<ol>
<li>The ladders are meant to fall down the shaft (whoops so that’s going to be restored how did I miss that and perhaps a fan also)</li>
<li>The flicking light as you make your way up to the surface in the elevator. I really wanted to texture this similar to the original, the texture for the ceiling is actually hidden under the elevator in the default black mesa version. I have a feeling they will create this in 3d models, but If I get the time one day I may do this but for now the textures will be staying as they are.<br>
HAPPY EASTER!!!</li>

            <p>One thing I probably oughta mention at this point, since you’re talking about compile times and it hasn’t been mentioned yet…</p>
<p>You know the large area above the map that has nothing in it? The large area that’s big so that the mortars can fly there? Yeah, apparently there will be a truckload of visleaves up there. I can distinctly remember trying to compile the C map during Vent Mod’s development and vvis getting hung up just because of the sheer amount of visibility calculations. I’m not even kidding around.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already or if there already isn’t one there, put a func_viscluster in that entire area. That way vvis will have a much more managable amount of things to do and it should speed up compiling.</p>

            <p>Nah can’t be bothered. I’m leaving it here if people come across it and try it then great.</p>
<p>The thing is I still have a crash issue to contend with also. I am using the animation revamp though so perhaps that makes it crash for me because I know this has caused issues in other mods. Let us know if it still crashing for you my guess is it probably is. But I know it’s far more stable than it was.</p>
<p>I think I know what the issue is with the Rappelling grunts in the shaft or at least I am going to try killing off the A.I. Battle line and A.I. stand off once entering the bunker. This must be what is screwing with the Rappelling grunts as I can’t think of anything else.</p>

<p>Any pick up or fixes that get pointed out to me will now be included in the extension in to vent mod.</p>
<p>There won’t be another release of the Stock Remix stand alone. All other versions from this point will link into vent mod If that makes sense.</p>
<p>Much of the problems of doing this map have been the Osprey and outdoor indoor areas that crossover. From this point in the mapping onwards I don’t have to worry any more about compiling the whole map whenever I make small changes which is taking around 30 mins every time I even make very small changes. Even with the Cordon tool It will not look like it does with the sky Box and lighting vs indoor / out door shadows. So It’s been a lot more time consuming than I realized it would be.</p>

            <p>Looking at your pictures I think the default ladders suit that area better so I will actually revert that back to it’s default skin but I really want the shaft to have the yellow ladders as in the original. That’s why I need to compile a model If that makes sense as I want to either give the ladder.</p>
<p>4 skins or 2 different models.</p>
<p>By the way if you find the Bug of walking away from the shaft door that blows up while HECU are rappelling that’s not my fault either where one of them they land on either the insode lip of the bunker or the outer corner. I don’t know why they deviate from the path track that they are meant to follow depending on the players position. But I did lower how far down they could rappell as they would stop and not see the player from behind the Hazzard cross beams.</p>
<p>can also see the pipes don’t link on the right. I kept having to change them and I had to swap that one for 2 seperate ones as It would just be black otherwise.</p>

<p>Not to worry though, I found a way to revert the ladders back to their normal color. Through entspy, I changed the skin setting on the models to 0 (the skin setting on your ladders were set to 1). Once that’s done, delete those textures as you instructed us to do and the ladders will be back to normal like this: <img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad1e6ee75195a7a4aee912811c5deedece45e9b6_2_690x388.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="oHtNVoK3nKFoWg5cHzYPFKMI7oG" width="690" height="388" srcset="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad1e6ee75195a7a4aee912811c5deedece45e9b6_2_690x388.jpeg, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad1e6ee75195a7a4aee912811c5deedece45e9b6_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad1e6ee75195a7a4aee912811c5deedece45e9b6_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/a/d/ad1e6ee75195a7a4aee912811c5deedece45e9b6_2_10x10.png"></p>

<p>Funny thing about this is that despite fixing the texture of the ladders, it was still a bit messed up before getting on the ladder.</p>
<p>Edit: I realized that it was because I forgot about the top part of the ladder, which turned out to be a prop_static instead of a prop_physics_override like the the other 2 parts of the ladder.</p>

            <p>I am about to patch the link as there is a problem with the elevator at the start. Hammer did not shut down properly and it did not save changes there and I also made a mistake.</p>
<p>Yeah you are right about the Ladder but what I mean Is if you go back to the default map after playing this it won’t effect the game. I have to compile a model with that skin still. But this stuff takes forever and a day. quite frankly I am not touching this for the rest of this week after this hotfix. But I have included a little extra which I forgot about. Which is the return of the original Silo Door alarm. So that does not happen in this map but you can use it for the chapter.</p>
<p>Link Hotfixed.</p>
<p>Thanks for all you peeps help so far RK / Crypt / Deathmonkey /PCGC/ DKY and Faceless HECU  but it’s time for a break again from this until I start the extension when I feel like it.</p>

<p>Please enjoy it and have fun.</p>
<p>Ok I feel I have finished with the stock remix now.</p>
<p>Here is the pre-final if anything get’s brought up about it then I am willing to try and fix any errors or mistakes. feedback, praise and slagging off are all welcome.</p>
<p>If you have a crash tell me why you had a crash. Not where or when but the actual reason why you had a crash according to the code and then we will have to try and find someone who understands all that. Because I have not got an inkling about it.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Turn you shadow detail down a notch and your ansiotropic filtering a notch. This seemed to help me out of not crashing is probably too particle intensive. from high to medium and trilnear to bilinear.</p>
<p>The vmf file is here below.<br>
<a href="https://www.mediafire.com/view/wuv0o6m3evb549u/bm_c1a3c.vmf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.mediafire.com/view/wuv0o6m3evb549u/bm_c1a3c.vmf</a></p>
<p>If it’s something I did and If you want to poke around in there go ahead and tell me what I did wrong.</p>
<p>could not fix cinematic physics rock issue in the default stock map. Did not get around to trying to compile the model for the ladder texture yet  so the rule still applies to delete the textures from the Materials/models/props_c17</p>
<p>and delete the files named metal ladder 002 and 003 to revert.</p>
<p>The Bunker has also been modified further but the shaft is as you see it. That’s not been altered from the screens I posted. If you spotted the flare in the screenshot it’s been deleted I was hoping to give the player the option to burn a HECU Rappelling down the shaft to death but If you throw one of those at him it just bounces off so I got rid of it.</p>
<p>On with the extension.</p>

            <p>So I did the surface and then I did the vent shaft and then the bunker started felling a bit less detailed so I re-did the bunker I should have been finished already with this stock remix by now but designing a new look for the bunker and getting the lighting looking good took a while.</p>
<p>Anyway heres some screen of the new Bunker “look”</p>
<p>I should be posting up a pre-final version tomorrow or the day after basically the only thing I can’t fix is a very occasional crash bug still unaware what this is and the piece of cinematic physics rock floating in the air which I’m not sure is there or not by default.</p>

<p>Running on empty now…but I will get the extension out that leads in to vent Mod but the extra map (have a week) I fear will have to wait to the summer. But I will come back to finish this as I had first planned my hopes have been foresighted and perhaps a bit ambitious for what I could achieve in a small space of time.</p>
<p>The bunker had to have 5 info lightings to get the props to light and the lighting here so far took a day I think it’s good eneough now but something tells me still it’s not quite there I wanted to create lines with the pipes that guide the player but the walls feel like they need a two brush look. But I am going to stop here and get on with the extension into vent mod.</p>

<p>Having slept on it I am going to make sure that bunker really looks the nuts! I have been checking out some old WW2 Bunker images and I think I have a good way to handle the wall and ceiling architechture which needs injecting to this area quite Badly. This is the only Bunker we get to go inside of although we see plenty from the exterior in Black Mesa. So this really needs to conjure images of what the rest of the Bunkers look like in the players imagination as this is the only taste of those bunker complex that we get to experience. this may mean It will take longer but there is no rush is there.</p>

            <p>Yeah I am basically having a bit of a meltdown over nothing.</p>
<p>Hammer editor has got to me not crypts feedback, I am listening and It was the problems that I am encountering that are the annoying thing not the feedback, If I did not care I would not have wrote a lengthy reply.</p>
<p>I am not upset with him and I hope he is not upset with me if so sorry but I do really want to do this well and I feel like I can only do so much with what I can do within my skills. I’d love to be able to churn out 3d models six to the dozen But this is something I cannot bring to the table. But I am listening and I won’t be defeated(by Hammer Editor).</p>

<p>I have rebuilt the original texture from the ground up. I am hoping that this can be shifyed on the x axis so It does not look too repeatable. If not I will make more of them. still needs a bit more work but I am going to go for this. and see if this works.</p>
<p>I do care see, but he might be pleased that I can see the prop vents that were originally used are going to go back in because I can see they will work already. I can’t just click my fingers but I am going back to the start on this part.</p>
<p>If I had not had put that shiny texture I would perhaps not have known or realised how bad the lighting issues were. So in a way it’s been a good thing as lighting was always going to be a big part of the main vent shafts. But it’s also one of those unseen issues until you build your cubemas and it all goes wrong.</p>
<p>I was going off target with it anyway. Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p>Small Update:</p>
<p>I have a confession to make that the map I uploaded was compiled on fast because I could not get the map to compile on normal. This has now changed and further optimisation was required to get it to compile on normal so that goal has been reached this may also sort out the crashing not sure need to test it personally. So anyway I am making progress on this and I am hoping that I can get this totally finished by the end of the week as in the stock remix. but what this means is that the extended version that links into ventmod won’t be far behind it. and this is really where my project starts proper rather than fiddling with Black Mesa maps, which in all honesty I have the up most respect for the work they did and don’t really want to change any of there other maps now but anyway I wanted to do this and I am getting closer still so there is the news.</p>
<p>Nah still crashing… what is it I don’t know.</p>
<p>map is much more stable but still the occasional crash could it be entities? The vent shaft I think looks good it was an Issue with the texture settings in the VMT this has sorted out the faces did not need to change the brushes. I like the new lighting here and I’ll post up a screenie soon, Redid the gate sign it’s now rusted metal.</p>
<p>Fixed the issue with the osprey getting bombed the mortars turn off when if the player goes to the area with the osprey as it is deploying grunts this limits the friendly fire and the grunts also now clear the relay points which was much easier than I thought. And makes death a lot more certain which is the main goal on the extension to the surface.</p>
<p>I hope to release this tomorrow and call it a day on tweaking and get on with the extended area which is all new. All in all it’s coming together I feel now. But the crash bug has escaped me of what it is and I am at a loss on it still unfortunately. Although it is nowhere near as frequent and is much more stable just now and again it will blip and crash normally with a mortar funnily enough but before it explodes. That makes me wonder what is it? as a trigger is firing there are a lot of triggers in this map and I need 90% of them.</p>

            <p>The thing is, not only did he say that he didn’t like something you did, but he also told you exactly what could be done to make it better.</p>
<p>Something tells me that you (perhaps subconsciously) ignored his suggestions and just took his feedback as an unsubstantiated attack, which, as a third party observer to this discussion, I can tell you is not the case.</p>
<p>Anyway, as for your huge Propper model idea, don’t do that. Lighting on models is worse than brushes, and even more so when they’re huge. Brushes are always your best bet for lighting, because regardless of how finicky they are, models are worse.</p>

            <p>I value your feedback don’t get me wrong, but you are just telling it like “I don’t like that”</p>
<p>Which is fine you are entitled to your opinion and I don’t have a problem if you don’t like something I do but if you perhaps know a better way of doing something or you might know the solution to a problem I have I would appreciate some help, or a least a finger that points me in the right direction, or somewhere near to where I am trying to get to. Most of the things you don’t like funnily enough I don’t like either, but It’s because there are still hurdles to overcome.</p>
<p>That does not mean I expect anything from you or anybody here. I don’t know what to think perhaps you feel this is easy, or perhaps it might be easy for you. I don’t count your feedback as totally trashing but you need to first understand that I am not perhaps conducting this as you might find a normal modding team does.</p>
<p>That’s because there is no team  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  It’s just me trying to get my head around this particular map which I honestly had no intentions originally of altering that much but because of the first bout of feedback this is where it is now. That’s a direct consequence of the feedback so don’t think I don’t value your opinions but you need to understand where I am at and what I am trying to achieve and how I am carrying out this, but don’t fret I am listening to you folks, I’m just a bit worn out by it.</p>
<p>My current feeling is that the vent shaft with the outside sky is going to be a huge prop made in propper. If I can’t get the lighting faces sorted out and the shadows.</p>
<p>Also the Osprey is going to need more dynamics in terms of movement.</p>
<p>I appreciate you being involved, but like I said It’s got to me currently having a small break and then going at it again.</p>
