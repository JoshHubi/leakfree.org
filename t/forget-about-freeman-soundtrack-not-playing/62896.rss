    <title>Forget About Freeman Soundtrack Not Playing?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/forget-about-freeman-soundtrack-not-playing/62896</link>
    <description>When i&#39;m at the famous &quot;forget about freeman&quot; big fight with the epic soundtrack at the new public beta version, the soundtrack doesn&#39;t play at all! (i hope this isn&#39;t intended because it was one of the best fitting songs ever). (RIP blast pit 2 ost :frowning: )

Also, there are 4/5 invisible HECU models with only the mp5 showing there. They don&#39;t do anything. but i can kill them</description>

            <p>Are you using mods? Are you in latest Public Beta? Have you used old save?<br>
I would recommend going into Beta. unsubscribing all mods, verifying game files and restarting the chapter.</p>
