    <title>Regarding Tentacle creature in Blast Pit</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/regarding-tentacle-creature-in-blast-pit/2799</link>
    <description>I was reading through the wiki for Black mesa source just to pass the time, and I came across the Tentacle entry, and from what I read it sounded like the tentacles were just going to be there... now what I mean is from the sounds of the wiki entry everyone missed the massive creature itself that the tentacles are but arms of, you can find it when you swim down into the water and look to the right I believe, it is laying against the side containment wall dying with 3 stubs where the tentacles used to connect to it

Did it perhapes get overlooked or was the wiki just worded improperly? And I am probably being to perfectionistic, but hey... I love Half Life</description>

            <p>The devs wouldn’t just overlook that detail. Someone just forgot to mention it in the wiki, I guess.</p>

            <p>Yes it just seemed like from the way the wiki was worded it would not be in the game or something, like I said I may just be, being anal retentive on this but was wondering</p>
