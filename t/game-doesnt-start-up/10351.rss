    <title>Game doesn&#39;t start up</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-doesnt-start-up/10351</link>
    <description>I recently downloaded BMS. And it loads up the &#39;Starting up Black Mesa Source&#39; menu. However; when that is done it shows up with a black screen for a split second and crashes, my steam friends thing shows &#39;In-Game Black Mesa Source&#39; and after the black screen is gone, it shows just the normal blue text.

Prior to this issue (2 or 3 days ago) It was running perfectly fine, no issues all on high setting also, with no frame lag of any sort. Could it be cause I tried to start the game up using &quot;-sw -noborder -w&quot; once? I removed this console start up code the moment after this issue, and it still gives off an error. It is kinda irritating and since I just got the game, waited a good 3 hours doing the torrent, and now it doesn&#39;t want to work anymore. I&#39;m honestly willing to do anything to try and have a possible fix. 

EDIT- I also get this &#39;error&#39; I guess, on my other account which has (HL2 E1 &amp; E2 and Gmod &lt;- Has all the HL2 stuff I need in it.) Which would say &#39;Searching for Steam Updates.&#39; And would go on forever doing this search.

Thanks for reading,
