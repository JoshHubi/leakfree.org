    <title>What Difficulty Will you play Black Mesa on?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-difficulty-will-you-play-black-mesa-on/9315</link>
    <description>I think I&#39;ll do hard.  Only because I&#39;ve been waiting so long for this and I figured that will give me the most out of my experience.  I usually stick with medium or normal the first time I play a game, but it&#39;ll be really interesting trying hard the first time through.</description>

<p>Maybe for all 3 difficulties. Or those maybe select through those 3 numbers in a random order. I don’t know.</p>
<p>Like if <span class="hashtag">#1</span> = 10, <span class="hashtag">#2</span> = 15, <span class="hashtag">#3</span> = 30, then it would probably select between 10 and 30 on each shot that you make. But I don’t know, honestly.</p>

<p>…I really want to play it on hard mode (like to play like surviving, low ammo and health and that shit), but I just hate when the human enemies need 3 close shotgun blasts to the head. Can you tell us what is the difference for human soldiers between normal and hard mode?</p>

</aside>
<p>IIRC, it has been stated that the Hgrunt’s health, at least on hard, has been improved when compared to HL.  Also, i think ONLY ammo/health drops/pickups and your resistance to damage changes with difficulty.</p>
<p>sorry, too lazy to confirm. :meh:    Perhaps, a browsing developer wont mind chiming in.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Particularly when you have to go up against agrunts. Those are some tough motherfuckers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah… when I encounter them I usually spam the Tau cannon or the MP5 grenades. That takes them down quickly, and I usually have more than enough ammo for those since I spend about half the game saving them up for opportunities like that.</p>
<p>The MP5 grenade has actually become something of a main weapon for me, actually. It’s kind of funny since I use it probably way too much. Too bad its ammo capacity got nerfed in Black Mesa… that would’ve been fun to carry 10 of those things throughout the game.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Would there be a way to set the HECU grunts to a lower difficulty while keeping the rest of the game on hard? What about changing the damage I deal specifically to the HECU to a higher amount?</p>

            <p>I am unsure.</p>
<p>While I’ve managed to go through Half-Life 1 and 2 with full health/suit and full ammo I don’t know about how I’ll manage anything like that with Black Mesa’s better AI combined with less specific points the enemies will stop at.</p>
<p>Would there be a way to set the HECU grunts to a lower difficulty while keeping the rest of the game on hard? What about changing the damage I deal specifically to the HECU to a higher amount?</p>

            <p>Honestly, I’ll start with “easy”. I’d rather enjoy Black Mesa, than to be frustrated that I keep on dying somewhere.</p>

            <p>Just the thing I wanted to ask. I really want to play it on hard mode (like to play like surviving, low ammo and health and that shit), but I just hate when the human enemies need 3 close shotgun blasts to the head. Can you tell us what is the difference for human soldiers between normal and hard mode?</p>

<p>What kinds of “pull your hair out moments”?</p>
<p>More specifically, do all or most of them involve the HECU? I’ve always found them to be a massive health-drainer in the original Half-Life (on Normal) unless I methodically headshotted them with the power of quick save.</p>

            <p>I actually found myself enjoying HL1 most when playing on hard mode.<br>
It made you more aware of your environment and check out every possibility.</p>
<p>Also, scenery is best experienced when as inaccessible as possible.<br>
We all know that the actual waiting / striving for something creates more excitement than the actual thing itself.<br>
It’s just like Christmas.<br>
So if you just go through BM like some tourist, you’ll not be nearly as thrilled as when having to do a little something for it.</p>
<p>My two psychological cents.</p>

<p>On hard, vorts take at least a double shotgun blast to down, if not following up with the MP5/M4. This should tell you something about the difficulty of the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Particularly when you have to go up against agrunts. Those are some tough motherfuckers.</p>
