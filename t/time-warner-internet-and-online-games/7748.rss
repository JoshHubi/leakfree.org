    <title>Time Warner Internet and Online Games?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/time-warner-internet-and-online-games/7748</link>
    <description>So I had AT&amp;T internet but my family decided to switch to Time Warner for our internet for whatever reason. And now after a couple games I keep getting kicked off of Bad Company 2. 

Has anyone else had this happen if they have Time Warner or is it something else? Because I had no problem with AT&amp;T. 

Also is there any way to fix it without switching back because that&#39;s not going to happen.</description>

<p>if you have DSL your phone line is losing sync with the stream, call your provider and tell them to fix it or enable interleaved (+50ms ping)</p>

<p>Interesting… what’s the best way to say that to a tech support guy so that he understands instead of making you go through 100 useless steps?</p>

            <p>I’ve always had Time Warner Cable too. I never had any problems.  Of course, I never switched from any other internet service.  What Kairouseki said, about changing the DNS server or putting settings back to default will do the trick.  Makes sense.</p>

            <p>I don’t have that ISP, but my own is giving me similar issues… It shows as a sudden lag spike when I play online, then I stop being able to contact the server, even though I keep receiving data from the server, until the game server disconnects me for receiving no data from me. I can usually quit and re-enter pretty much instantly, though.</p>
<p>But I’m puzzled as to what could be happening. And just like you, just using the browser to go around the web normally doesn’t give me any problem.</p>
<p>I’m using Distributel’s DSL internet, if anyone cares.</p>

            <p>It just happened again and this time I couldn’t connect to the internet at all for a few seconds after. It’s weird because the little icon in the task bar still says 5 bars and no problem but there is a problem.</p>
<p>Edit: Maybe changing the DNS servers will help. I had them not on default when I had AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Or maybe setting them back to default.</p>
<p>Yet another Edit: It only happens when I play BC2 though. I haven’t played any other online games but it doesn’t happen when just casually using the internet.</p>
