    <title>HUD damage thingy</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hud-damage-thingy/13942</link>
    <description>So after the houndeye blows up the bridge, there&#39;s a map transition. A headcrab jumped just before the transition and after the map loaded, I got bitten by it. After that I had a permanent red damage-showing thing, just stuck there on the screen, even though I didn&#39;t take any damage after that.
