            <p>Seems to be a growing habit of posting random thoughts on the forum.</p>
<p>Aside from getting a headache from reading typo after typo, I agree a Myst-like game from Valve would have been very nice.  Way to relax and wander around.</p>

<p>The play is pretty horrible as well.</p>
<p>Never head of the game, though.</p>

            <p>Clearly you’ve seen this over-used meme posted before, and wanted to jump on the train and find the first excuse to post it that you could. Way to be irrelevant and unoriginal. A pity you’re a few years late to the party, and couldn’t come up with something yourself.</p>
<p>OP - cheers for the info, I’d heard the name associated with Valve before but forgotten about it. Another page in Valves history.</p>
