    <title>Turntable ground not working properly</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/turntable-ground-not-working-properly/5866</link>
    <description>I recently bought a new (well, old) Pioneer amplifier. I&#39;ve connected my turntable ground to it properly, the same way as I did with my previous amplifier. However, the humming isn&#39;t completely gone, though it&#39;s less loud.

Any thoughts?</description>

            <p>I’ve taken a look at the wikipedia article. It sounds like that might indeed be the culprit, but I wouldn’t know what exactly is causing it or how I can fix it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I did switch the amp from 210V to 220V (220V is the net voltage, and everything connected to the amp is at 220V). Maybe something went wrong there.</p>

            <p>Is there a phono input on your amp? If not, it might not have a phono preamp stage, which could explain the noise as the level coming out of your turntable is likely to be very low (plus it will not sound as good without the RIAA eq compensation).</p>
<p>But atm, the most likely explanation is indeed the lack of correct grounding.</p>

            <p>The thought of something like that had occurred to me. I’ll take a look at it later, thanks.</p>

            <p>Hey Burbinator, have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_loop_(electricity)" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this Wikipedia article on ground loops</a>.  There’s a good possiblity that a ground loop is your culprit. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>There’s no level dial, no separate volume dial on the speakers, no software to speak of (it’s an amplifier from 1973) and no amplifier settings other than bass and treble and a few on/off switches which are all off.</p>
<p>Edit: I have two sets of speakers connected to this amp though, but the humming persists when I switch it to use just one.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just a thought…</p>
<p>If you want to go “board level” Try upping the capacitors on your amp output.</p>

            <p>Turn down the level on the amplifier, or the volume on the speakers. If the humming doesn’t go away adjust your software volume levels and/or amplifier settings.</p>
