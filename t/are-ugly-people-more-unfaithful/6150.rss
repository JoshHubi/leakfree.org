    <title>Are Ugly People more unfaithful?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/are-ugly-people-more-unfaithful/6150</link>
    <description>Hey there, guess I should explain myself before everyone starts spouting normative bullshit.

In the past year or so, I&#39;ve seen many of my good friends cheat, or get cheated by their spouses. One of them got really emotional about it and I spoke to my uncle because I didn&#39;t know how to deal with him. After loads of blabber he got onto one of his many theories; about &quot;Fat and ugly People&quot;.
He essentially proposed that because ugly people get less sexual attention, the insecurities developed lead them to act more irrationally when they do get attention.


And the more I looked into it.. the more truthful it seemed to become. A hugely disproportionate amount of &#39;Uglier&#39; people were responsible for relationships breaking up because of cheating (still cheating only caused a fraction of the break ups I could think of). And I also thought of the people I know who &#39;sleep around&#39; at my college, a staggering proportion of the more reknown ones are horrendous looking, but love doing it and telling people about it.


Not saying that good looking people are much more moral when it comes to relationships, but from your experience is there any truth in this?</description>

<p>I personally have zilcho experience in this field (before you toss me to the flames, I’m only 15) but logically I can’t really imagine there to be a relationship between looks and faithfulness. but I sorta got what you were getting at there.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that too.</p>
<p>But just because someone likes sex doesn’t mean he/she is automatically going to cheat on the next best opportunity.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ugliness has nothing to do with cheating.</p>
<p>It is insecurity, not lack of attractiveness, that makes people prone to seduction. And insecurity can stem from many sources. There are in fact many very attractive girls who are promiscuous because they are mentally unstable or just plain insecure. This is often the result of too much and too aggressive attention from the opposite sex on too many disturbing levels, also often too early in their youth or even childhood.</p>

            <p>In my experiences attractiveness and mental instability increase the chances for cheating, not unattractiveness. That being said I’m surprised I haven’t done it to anyone, considering the fact that I’m both a sexy meatbeast and crazier than a hatful of periwinkles.</p>

            <p>Pretty stupid thread.</p>
<p>Imo, less attractive people are generally more interesting and faithful. You think there are ugly manwhores who sleep around? Attractive people are more often arrogant douchebags in comparison to ugly or less attractive people. And honestly, I don’t think I’ve really seen any people I consider to be ugly, besides those who have suffered an accident or were born disfigured.</p>

<p>So, if this theory is true, you people all constantly cheat on your bf/gfs.</p>

<p>Although I get that was supposed to be a hilarious ruse; no. Again it only happens in the minority of breakups.</p>
<p>Sorry if i’m being liberal with my use of the word ‘ugly’. I don’t mean a 20st person with a face like a smacked arse. I’m talking mainly of 4/10’s, girls (and boys) with a chip on their shoulder about their looks, but who can look very presentable (my friends call them ‘pork flowers’) on a night out, usually going out with a person who is of a similar attraction level.</p>
<p>I’ve just found at college, no matter how fugly you are; if you’re a girl theres always someone willing to sleep with you. And for that reason an individuals attraction level doesn’t make it even out.</p>

            <p>I am not bad looking at all but I push everybody away because I only love the internet. D:</p>
<p>Also if someone cheats on their respective loved one, the other person might remark something like “she was fucking ugly anyway” hence the misconception. In fact, if I think logically, “ugly” people are probably more loyal because it’s harder for them to find someone who would even tolerate their presence properly.</p>

            <p>I’d have imagined it’d be other way around, since good looking people typically have more opportunities to be unfaithful, as they’re viewed as more attractive from more people.</p>
