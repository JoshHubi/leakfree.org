    <description>So yeah, my CPU fan just broke down, without any apparent reason. And since my CPU&#39;s starting to get a bit old (Core 2 Duo E4440), I think I&#39;m gonna get a new one. My mobo&#39;s (Asus P5B-Plus)socket is 775, and I got a budget of about 300 buckets, less if possible. And I&#39;m not looking for top of the line CPUs, just one that will allow me to play game without any major lag.

Suggestions?</description>

            <p>Ok, so I used a different benchmarking program… Turns out my GeForce 7200 is outperformed by a 6600 in half the tests, and completely breaks down on Pixel Shader 2.0 and Vertex Shader 2.0 effects tests (9.8fps).</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p><em>checks stats</em></p>
<p>Whoa, who sold me this lemon? Ah wait, they didn’t. It was the replacement I was given after I fried the last one… And that was an ATI Radeon X600 or somesuch…</p>

<p>Anything really.  Do some benchmarking with <a href="https://www.freshdevices.com/freshdiag.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">FreshDiagnose</a> to find out if any hardware components aren’t performing like they should.</p>
<p>Also, this could just be software (read: spyware) related.  Open the task manager, by pressing ctrl+alt+delete, and see if any processes are using an abnormal amount of CPU.  If there are, scan your computer for spyware or trojans with <a href="https://www.safer-networking.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Spybot S&amp;D</a>.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ok, I have a prebuilt. I’ll give you a few minutes to facepalm, laugh, cry, and whatever else you need to do before composing yourself and continuing.</p>
<p>So it’s a 1st gen Scaleo P. Pentium IV, 3.4 GHz, Hyperthreaded; 1GB RAM, GeForce 7300 SE / 7200 GS (512 memory)*, ASUS P5GD1-FM/S, and being prebuilt it has a neutered BIOS to prevent overclocking.</p>
<p>*I’ll be taking a closer look at this once I shut it down after reading temps[/SIZE]</p>
<p>RAM: 2*512, with 4 slots.</p>
<p>Fan setup: Stock, one fan bringing air in over the hdd, one CPU fan. Fan in the PSU blowing air out. You might notice that’s a bit crappy and it probably won’t surprise you I’ve had to have the PSU, CPU and GPU replaced because they fried (running at 110˚C under load just ain’t healthy). GFX card is fanless :fffuuu:. I’ve also added a fan to the back of the case, blowing out. Made a difference, but not enough of one.</p>
<p>Operating Temperatures: (Degrees Celsius)<br>
Note, these aren’t completely accurate as I’m not giving them much time to reach their normal operating temps. <span class="bbcode-i">Oh, and this is with the case off. Bit higher when the case is on and the comp is sitting in my desk, not on it</span>.<br>
Idle CPU: ~46 (Stable)<br>
Idle GPU: ~60 (and climbing)</p>
<p>Load: Running Alien Swarm TileGen for about 5 minutes<br>
Load CPU: 65<br>
Load GPU: 70</p>
<p>After returning to idle, the CPU drops comfortably to regular temps but the GPU, being fanless, drops very slowly.</p>
<p>Ok, first woe. Boot time jumped to 10 minutes for some reason; not sure what caused this. About 5 minutes were spent before even beginning to boot the OS (since it didn’t matter whether I was booting from hdd or cd). Resolved this by taking it apart, checking pulling some leads out, blowing in the connectors and plugging them back in, and putting it back together. And I’m not even from the Nintendo generation. This just isn’t supposed to work. A loose power connection to the hdd?</p>
<p>Ok, second and more important woe. I used to be able to play source games at a comfy ~30fps. The gfx card ain’t great, but I can live with 30fps. Except now it’s dropped to 5fps. Unplayable.</p>
<p>Ok, so first question, what could be causing such a drop in framerate?</p>
<p>Second, I have ~£150 available which I may use to upgrade this computer. What’s the most efficient use of my money?</p>
<p>If I wished to update the BIOS with manufacturer standard to be able to OC, I read that I’d need a chip that’s not soldered so that I could replace it. Only one chip matches that description on the motherboard and it’s labelled PMC Flash… Would that be the one I’m looking for should I just buy a new mobo?</p>
<p>Computer Usage: Source games, Hammer work. Windows games requiring pixel shader 2.0… Nothing overly intensive. Target fps: ~30</p>
<p>Right, I think that’s about it…</p>

            <p>When overclocking you should try to stay without certain limits though, for example I try to keep my CPU core voltage below 1.35v (Intel maximum recommended spec.) and some other voltages like memory since I have the memory controller in the CPU instead of the northbridge (you don’t have to worry about that).</p>
<p>Just Google some info, I’m sure those CPU’s have some overclocking threads.</p>

            <p>Double posting because I got a pretty major update:</p>
<p>I tried to put in my old CPU with my new fan, and everything’s working fine. So I think it may be my BIOS that’s too old for my CPU. I’ll edit it and edit this post to keep the few of you updated to the latest news.</p>

            <p>It looks complicated at first, but it gets really easy. Just keep it simple, higher speeds means it needs more power, so higher voltage = more power running through your CPU = more heat = needs better cooling.</p>
<p>As for FSB, depends whether or not you have the later model Intel CPU’s, you overclock them bumping the BCLK (baseclock) unless you have an unlocked multiplier on your CPU (only the most expensive model has this so don’t worry about that). Lets say your baseclock is 133 MHz and your multiplier is x21, that means 21x133 MHz = 2.8 GHz</p>
<p>If you want to overclock, you increase the baseclock to 171 MHz with a multiplier of x21, this gives you 21x171 MHz = 3.6 GHz<br>
In order to get your PC to boot or get into Windows (and run stability tests without bluescreening) you’ll have to increase stuff like vCore voltage. There’s complete articles on what settings you can use for certain overclocks (you’ll still have to tweak it as not every component is the same for everyone).</p>
<p>Programs like Prime95 will stress your CPU at full load for many hours, if your CPU manages to complete roughly 8 hours of stress then it’s stable (= no bluescreens) and ofcourse check out the min, max and average temperatures to see if they’re acceptable (average around 65 C max at load and 80 C peak temperature, CPU will slow itself down above 71 C)<br>
To get a decent overclock proper cooling (copper heatsinks) and thermal compound is a must.</p>
<p>I currently have an i7 930 running at 3.44 GHz (164x21) @ 1.24v<br>
This CPU can reach 4 GHz easily but it’s fucking warm this time of year and due to temperature issues I’ll keep it at 3.44 GHz<br>
Use CPU-z to check your CPU info and RealTemp to check temperatures.</p>
<p>Here’s mine:</p>
<p>(my temps are 8-10 C higher than usual)<br>

            <p>Nah. My rig is just not mounted for OCing. I’m using stock fans for cooling, I think my RAM sticks aren’t all at the same speed, and I just can’t understand shit at that voltage/fsb stuff.</p>

            <p>May I ask why you don’t overclock your CPU? There’s really no danger to it. Intel does the same thing, they get a 2.66 GHz clocked CPU and bump it up to 3.2 GHz and then charge twice the price. Luckily most people aren’t dumb and they simple buy the cheaper model and overclock it.</p>
<p>I’ve had a Q9450 for years, had it running at 3.6 GHz with minimum increase in voltage, that’s a 1 GHz overclock.</p>
<p>Killing your CPU will only happen if you have bad cooling and let your CPU run above the thermal threshold or if you pump extreme voltages through it at insane clockspeeds (usually used for breaking records not daily usage). I can’t even remember the last time I saw someone who killed his CPU. (overclocking motherboards have failsafes anyway to prevent this from happening)</p>
<p>Almost all of the newer motherboards support overclocking with special features including BIOS overclocking tools integrated, failsafe switches on the motherboard and all that stuff. Sure ‘back then’ overclocking wasn’t a big deal, but now I overclock my GPU, CPU and memory. Not to mention my GPU was overclocked by the manufacterer itself, even the memory itself was specifically designed for overclocking.</p>

            <p>I got some kind of issue right now. I have the CPU, everything’s plugged in, but when I starts it, nothing shows up on the screen. I can hear and see everything running (although the CPU’s fan is running very slowly. I can see it, but it’s blurred), but the screen stays on sleep mode. And I ear no beeps. When I would normally hear one that means that everything’s fine.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

<p>Well I often run many apps at the time. MSN, Steam, Ableton Live, Winamp, Chrome etc… so a Quad Core might be useful.</p>

<p>Oh, then yes it would be rather helpful.  I only said that because you said just something to run games without lag.</p>
