    <title>Failed to create D3D Device! -&gt; Only window mode working!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/failed-to-create-d3d-device-only-window-mode-working/10688</link>
    <description>Hi!
I installed the game right fine. But it is not working at all. 
I got the d3d error everytime - even if i set the res in the launch options!
The only way to get it working is to run it in window mode (-window in launch options). Then i am able to play the game. When i run it in window mode and set the res to fullscreen then there is no error, but the screen keeps black.

hardware:

full updated asus n56vz


is there any fix for this problem?</description>

            <p>You’re not the first to report this problem. It seems to be Optimus-related drivers issue. No fix (except for playing in windowed mode) known so far.<br>
You could “workaround” it by using borderless windowed mode. Add following to BM command line parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-windowed -noborder -x 0 -y 0 -width &lt;your screen resolution width&gt; -height &lt;your screen resolution height&gt; </code></pre>
