    <description>Hi BMS devs, first i want to thank you for probably one of the best remakes in  videogame´s history, the result of you work is pretty much valve quality, and this is something not less than amazing.

I have been waiting for this game since the beginning and the day of launch i didnt get away from the internet until i was playing it. I have a computer with nvidia 3dvision and i try to play every game in 3d. They are games that are actually unplayable in 3D others that fit like a glove, and they are games like blackmesa that would be perfect except for 3 or 4 issues.

In the case of blackmesa they are 4 issues, i think that 2 of them are fixable by the team(If they want to spend time on it of course) the other 2 are probably caused by the engine of the game so i&#39;m expecting the solution to be impossible. Very well, so far the issues are:

_The ironsight of the game is horrible in 3d, in fact you can&#39;t play with it turned on, you can turn it off by console command of course but this is not the problem. The problem is that you can&#39;t use the nvidia 3dvision crosshairs, this is something strange that i haven´t seen in other games, maybe it is easily fixable?.

_The weapons, they look like errr giant weapons/models in the background of the scenery, it is the first time i have seen something like this, this is another issue that maybe is fixable.(As an option in the menu maybe?)

_Some water affects, a common problem that probably has no solution.

_Some backgrounds, this happens with other valve games like L4D so again it probably has no solution.

I know that all this is not really important, but i wanted to tell my experience. Otherwise, the game is amazing on 3d, maybe someone out there who likes to play on 3d as much as me can mod the game on the future to  make it compatible or maybe some of these problems can be so easily solved that the dev team can expend time on it. 

Thx a lot for reading and sorry for my english</description>
