Capcom has announced that it is remaking its 1996 survival horror classic, Resident Evil, for the PC, Xbox One, PS4, PS3 and Xbox 360, bringing the game back for a new generation of fans to enjoy.
From what we’ve seen so far, the in-game assets seem to be based on the 2002 Gamecube remake. That said, this new version will have all new visuals, run at 1080p resolution and we’ll even get the option to switch between the 4 : 3 and 16:9 aspect ratios.

In addition, players will be able to choose between two different control schemes. You can play through using the original ‘pivot’ controls or you can use an updated, modern control scheme in which players move according to the direction of the analogue stick.
The game will also be arriving on the Xbox 360 and PS3 although it will only run at 720p. There is no word on frame rate caps just yet, we also don’t know if PC’s will be given the option to run the game at resolutions higher than 1920×1080

            <p>Weird that 60 fps is supported. I could have sworn they said it wouldn’t be. Even weirder that the PS4 and Xbone can’t run a 10+ year old game with prerendered backgrounds at 60 fps.</p>

<p>Tim Turi the RE fanboy of Game Informer asking the hard hitting question everyone wants answered at the end.  Avoiding overtly asking it but still at the same time asking about a potential RE2 remake.  The guy response with what is a somewhat optimistic statement imo, responding to the question “Is this the kind of project that would be helpful practice or experience if, hypothetically speaking you decided to do a remake of RE2 or 3” and he response “It would definitely be if we did, but if fans wanted a fully 3d one and we went down that road it wouldn’t be”.</p>
<p>I feel like this is almost certainly testing the waters for an RE2 remake.</p>

<p>10 minutes of gameplay from next-gen/PC version.</p>
<p>I’m really glad to see that they did a good job improving the CG background for high-resolution. Looks fairly clean and sharp, way better than the weird filtering that we saw on the initial screens.</p>

            <p>Correction: RE5 and RE6 aren’t shit games, they are shit as survival horror, which for some wrong reason Capcom promoted them to be.</p>
<p>Having given the games the wrong label resulted in unfulfillment of people’s expectations, making them “shit”<br>
Had they been promoted as action third person shooters, they would have shined next to Gears of War and so.</p>
<p>But to stay on topic, this release of RE1 is imply a <span class="bbcode-b">HD port</span> of the original remake, not remake 2. If they were to make the backgrounds 3D, with different controls etc then it wouldn’t be a HD port.</p>

            <p>Crowbar executions. Make it happen.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, I get that remakes should be paying tribute to the things that made their forerunners famous, but when a product paying tribute to the past replicates it’s major flaws as well, it can sabotage the whole product. A really good example would be Takedown: Red Sabre- intended as a love letter to the original Rainbow Six, the AI was fully capable of shooting people in the face from across the map with their backs turned. This happened a fair bit in the original Rainbow Six games, and I felt that it was intentional to replicate the original “feel” for the difficulty, but most reviewers really hated it because it made the game hard to the point of being unfair. The lack of a COMPLETE R6 replication (such as planning phase and multiple teams) also hurt the final product, so overall, Takedown came across as a broken shell rather than a complete experience. The game had major budgetary problems throughout development, and I think the dev team’s heart was in the right place, but things just didn’t come together at the end.</p>

            <p>No one is arguing that, we’re just saying that changing the gameplay mechanics of RE1 would make it a completely different game and that’s not what people want out of it.</p>
<p>It could work as an unlockable mode but making that the only way to play the remake would be a disaster.</p>
<p>I mean, what if Black Mesa turned out to be a cover based third person shooter?</p>

            <p>RE5 and 6 weren’t shit because the controls were working off the improved ones from RE4. They were shit because they lost their identity. “Mass appeal” has nothing to do with the actual game design. Survival horror can be just as effective when you have more control- hence Condemned. And maybe Outlast, I need to play that more.</p>

<p>Well, the newer RE games from 4 onward weren’t “scary” according to fans. I personally have only played RE4 to completion. I have RE5 but GFWL and fuck that shit, and I’ve tried the REmake but didn’t like the fixed camera angles. Overall I find it annoying that the RE developers can’t make the game scary without taking control away from the player. RE4 may have had “better” controls than the first three games, but Leon still controlled like a tank. Plus, he was up against Zombie napoleon for a main villain.</p>
<p>I guess Condemned 1 spoiled me, because it was a scary game where you had proper control and combat. Even though you could beat peoples’ faces in with lead pipes, you still felt vulnerable, and the atmosphere was just perfect. The point of the tirade is that horror games shouldn’t rely on lack of control to deliver scary content, at least in my humble opinion.</p>

<p>That sentiment is why RE 5 was bleh and 6 was shit.  Widening appeal.  This is we so many CoD clones exist. Everyone has to make their games more accessible. I wish the games industry would learn that you can make money on any game as long as you budget that game to cost less than what the market for it is.  There is easily enough old school RE fans to warrant making a whole new classic RE game with a small team and less marketing since its going marketing traditional fans.  But every game studio sees people like you and goes “oh if we just change this little thing no one will mind” until the entire game is different.</p>
<p>Also RE is like the only horror game I know that specifically has weird controls.  And its more a chicken and egg thing anyways.  They wanted 2d pre-rendered backgrounds to get more out of old hardware and tank controls are really the only reasonable way to control a game that is constantly swapping camera angles.</p>
<p>RE4 was a compromise and it was almost scarey at points but its just too actiony and there’s just way too many enemies.  This is why I am excited for The Evil Within, it looks like an advancement on RE4 but geared more for horror and less for action.</p>
<p>Seriously though sit down and just play remake for hours.  When I first played RE as a kid it was fucking confusing but I just started playing some more for the first time in years anticipation for The Evil Within and it comes back like riding a bike.  You’re just used so trained in the normal control format that anything that isn’t it sucks.  Its not like the traditional game movement makes anymore sense its just you learned it so long ago its second nature now.</p>

            <p>Also, a lot of people would argue that having the single-view layout with the “tank” controls makes the experience more scary - each view for a room is the one with the most effect for tension, and not being able to smoothly control your character adds more to it by adding a feeling of helplessness - something many games that try to do horror fail at making.</p>

            <p>You have a point when it comes to the genre in general but tank controls and fixed camera angles are part of what made the PS1 trilogy legendary. The games were entirely built around those features and they would be very different games otherwise.</p>

            <p>Well apparently Japanese devs from that period are retarded and often threw out the source code and assets when the game was done. So they don’t have access to much of the original assets and code so doing anything other than what they’re doing now would require coding/making assets from scratch.</p>

<p>It’s just bullshit is what it is. They are perfectly capable of building 3D environments for the game, they should just un-fuck the mechanics and make the game fun instead of trying to please the purists.</p>

</aside>
<p>Then it wouldn’t be a rerelease would it? It would be another remake, they don’t have the assets for the prerendered scenes anymore and even if they did they were probably built around those angles (ie backs of props non existent.  They’d have to remake the game from scratch which frankly isn’t going to happen.  Not every game is going to be fun for you.  I don’t think mobas are fun, I’ve tried them and just can’t get into them, but I don’t go on the Dota boards and talk about how they should unfuck the game. They make RE the way you are talking about now, see RE 6 , RE5 and RE:Revelations.</p>
