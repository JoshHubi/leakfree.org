    <title>Rockets and the Apache</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rockets-and-the-apache/14139</link>
    <description>This [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/617336568088471133/&#39;]thread[/url] reminded me to mention this.

Is it just me, or do the rockets fired from the RPG Launcher randomly bounce off the Apache?  At first, I thought maybe it was the Apache shooting them down, like the Combine Gunships do.  But on closer inspection, I&#39;m convinced this is a bug.  In both the Surface Tension battle and the one in my level, about 20% of the time, fired rockets bounce off the Apache, whether they are homing or not.  And it&#39;s not a subtle bounce - it&#39;s literally an abrupt 90º turn [i]in the opposite direction[/i].</description>

            <p>Hahah, I like the guy who said he got hit by his own rocket when it ricocheted off the Apache and came back at him.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>It’s not just you, I experience the same thing, and I believe it was pointed out by someone on an earlier thread shortly after the early access version was released.  I’m pretty sure the devs are already aware of the issue.</p>
<p>edit:  Upon another search I found <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/620712999969130727/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this thread</a>. Definitely looks like the devs are already aware.</p>
