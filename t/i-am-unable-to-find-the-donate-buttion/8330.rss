    <title>I am unable to find the donate buttion.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-am-unable-to-find-the-donate-buttion/8330</link>
    <description>It has recently come to my attention that I am unable to find a donate link. I would love to donate money to not only encourage, but to reward the makers of the mod for their work. Unfortunately, due to the donate link being difficult to find, I am unable to do so. 

On the off chance that there is not a donate buttion. When will such a thing be available? I&#39;d expect one to atleast come up after the mod releases. 

Sincerly, 
A fan.</description>

<p>What makes you think FakeFactory is an idiot, apart from the fact that he is an idiot?</p>
<p>Anyway, I’d also donate to the BM tm, but it has been long estabilished that they can’t ask for it, and would not accept it anyway. Plus if people could donate, they’d see it justified to troll the devs for a release date. No.The BM team owe us nothing.</p>
<p>Black Mesa will be completely free.</p>

<p>I see you don’t know very much about CM. The main part of this mod is HD textures, better lighting, better HDR, better reflections etc. You can also use HD characters, HD weapons models, new music and difficulty changes, but it’s an <span class="bbcode-b">addition</span>! You don’t have to use it, most player disable those additions.</p>

<p>Ethically, for the same reason that Congressmen aren’t allowed to accept millions of dollars as a “personal favor” from lobbyists.  Intellectually, because Half-Life is Valve’s IP, and the dev team aren’t allowed to draw a profit related to it without Valve’s explicit consent.</p>

<p>Fun fact. Fakefactory applied for Black Mesa. He was DENIED.</p>

<p>It’s illegal but some modders apparently don’t care… The problem is not only Valve’s IP but also the Source license (and Adriana Lima’s face, lol). BTW FakeFactory is German and AFAIK Germany is very harsh against copyrights infringements  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Creators of Blade Symphony (and Dystopia) were accepting money under “PHAN program” - also illegal, because you cannot make money with mods (even indirectly). Now they own Source license and they’ve got nice funding through kickstarter  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Theoretically Black Mesa and Cinematic Mod are both illegal, but Valve is an awesome company and they even support mods which use their IP  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Some non-profit(!) fan-made remakes of old games were shat down (with legal threats  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> ) by owners of IPs, e.g. Chrono Trigger by Squre Enix.</p>
<p>In some countries there are legal problems even with accepting donations in general - for instance in Poland only Charities can organize donations (and in spite of this, there are hundreds of illegal “donate buttons”, like Minecraft servers support etc.)</p>

<p>Cinematic Mod simply improves the graphics of a game, FakeFactory didn’t remake the whole HL2.</p>
<p>Besides, FakeFactory is a talentless hack and a bastard.</p>

</aside>
<p>Cinematic Mod is great if you DON’T use new music, new character models, new weapons and gameplay changes. FakeFactory can’t be talentless.</p>

            <p>They can’t accept any dotations? What about Cinematic Mod, they have a donate button, what’s the difference between them? Both are mods that improve the graphics, models etc.</p>

            <p>I loved the part where you assumed that the dev team would accept donations at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, they might not accept monetary donations, but they do live off sexual favors, so you better start lubing up if you want to play to mod.</p>

            <p>It’s lovely that you have good intent, but they cannot accept any money for the mod, because they dont own the material.</p>

            <p>They’ve never had a donate button and its highly unlikely they will ever have one.</p>

            <p>It has recently come to my attention that I am unable to find a donate link. I would love to donate money to not only encourage, but to reward the makers of the mod for their work. Unfortunately, due to the donate link being difficult to find, I am unable to do so.</p>
<p>On the off chance that there is not a donate buttion. When will such a thing be available? I’d expect one to atleast come up after the mod releases.</p>
<p>Sincerly,<br>
A fan.</p>
