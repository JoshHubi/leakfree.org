    <title>[Glitch] Health and Suit Stations</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glitch-health-and-suit-stations/10618</link>
    <description>A few times in the game I&#39;ve found suit and health dispensers that don&#39;t continue to dispense health when I hold my use key. Just now in Lambda Core,  in the room the Scientists use to brief you on Xen (and the asshole security guard), I had to repeatedly tap the use key to get my suit and health topped off because the dispensers inexplicably refused to keep going on a use key hold. The lions share of dispensers work fine throughout the mod, though. Perhaps it&#39;s an incidental glitch, but the ones in the aforementioned scene were all consistent with this problem. Anyone else run into this/ know how to fix it?</description>

            <p>I think I’ve had this happen to me before. Are you standing right in front of the charger?</p>
<p>I’ve found that if I’m looking at it at an angle/looking at the edge it’d heal me 2 points, then stop, over and over again.</p>
<p>If you mean something else, then I haven’t had it happen to me, sorry.</p>
