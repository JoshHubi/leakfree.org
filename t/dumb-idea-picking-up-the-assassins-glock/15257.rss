    <title>dumb idea: picking up the assassins glock</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dumb-idea-picking-up-the-assassins-glock/15257</link>
    <description>ok, a while ago I noticed that when you pick up the assassins glocks they replace yours but do nothing different.

this got me thinking why not have it so that when the player picks up the assassins glock they get an improved pistol with new stats.


this idea is pretty basic as tehre would only be two chances to get it and one of them you will lose it right afterwords. (but might be good for xen).



concept

tactical glock
pick up animation: Gordon looks at the glock he has then the one he just picked up and tosses the one he had away.
looks: teh glock with an extended mag and extended barrel/suppessor
random google image to show:  [url]https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_1043.jpg[/url]


differences


loaded ammo: 28
recoil: reduced by 25%(not really noticable)
automatic fire: accuracy increased by 50%.

and that would be it, no real improvements but it makes teh automatic fire mode more useful at longer range and reduces need to reload.




yeah likely a really bad idea, but eh posting do to beign bored.</description>

I did overwrite it with pakrat once, but it only works if the user starts that map first.<br>

            <p>imo just slap a suppressor on and that’d be it pretty much, or perhaps add a new mechanic to slap on a suppressor without entirely removing original glock (probably using scrollwheel)</p>
<p>good idea nevertheless</p>

            <p>Honestly I think it’d just be a better route to make weapon_assassin_glock act like a 9mm magazine instead of the current duplicate glock, but that’s just like, my opinion, man.</p>
<p>If it does have additional stuff added to it, making the standard glock be removed would also be a good idea, since you can technically switch between the two.</p>

            <p>well technically it would not be a new weapon, it would just be new to the player. Anyway as stated its just a dumb idea.</p>

            <p>There’s a bit of a stumbling-block in that this would be the first new weapon added to the game that wasn’t part of the original HL1 weapon set, but as far as new weapons go this seems like a decent one.</p>
<p>One thing that might be interesting to think about would be, since this is an assassin’s pistol, NPCs might not be as able to hear it being fired (as they do indeed have a listen mechanic).</p>
