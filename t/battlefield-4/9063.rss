    <title>Battlefield 4</title>

    <description>Well, I guess EA is finally ready to shoot themselves in the head...
[url=&#39;https://store.origin.com/store/ea/en_US/pd/productID.246001900&#39;]Battlefield 4 Beta[/url]
I love Battlefield more than most hardcore fans, but come on Battlefield 2 had to wait 5 years for a proper sequel, so that the whole game experience would be fresh(new engine, new mechanics, weapons, gameplay, ect.), but now thwy&#39;re trying to force another one out of the woodworks in 2013. I know this is nothing compared to yearly CoD, but some on we all can see that this is one of EA&#39;s sloppy ploys to compete with Activision and retrieve consumers money. There haven&#39;t even been any spin-offs like Bad Company 3 yet. 

What are your opinions on this. I guess I might be a little overreacting.</description>

            <p>I feel the same way, yet I think it’s inevitable. Especially with the cliffhanger ending of BF3.</p>
<p>I just wish they’d make a campaign that’s more open like the first Bad Company. I like the writers in Dice. I like how they handle Dialogue. They need to stick with satire, borderline parody style execution. Firstly, because no one else is doing it the way they did it, and that could be their whole hook staring them in the face, and secondly because why god why do I have to listen to white guy # 1 reprimanding white guy <span class="hashtag">#2</span> over something he and black guy <span class="hashtag">#1</span> (and only) did without orders? While Puerto Rican guy <span class="hashtag">#1</span> (and only) spews the most annoying fucking combat dialog the actor could come up with on the spot in the booth? not talking Battlefield formula specifically, but shooter formula in general. I loved BC1/2 because they didn’t follow that bullshit. BF3 didn’t really either, but it was getting real close to the edge. Really fucking close. I’m afraid they may cross it.</p>

            <p>That’s some conspiracy theory shit and I have a hard time believing that’s it. In some instances I could see it being a resources thing, as in BF3 multiplayer since there’s so many things going on. I wouldn’t think this is the case with other games though. It just seems like it’s so easy to implement and wouldn’t take too many resources to add in in most instances.</p>

            <p>I think it may be an issue with regional censorship laws. I can’t help but shake the feeling that Crytek is involved with BF3’s fucked up corpses somehow. Like, something about them and the Germany and the censorship and the international accessibility and all that puddin.</p>

            <p>I don’t understand why more games don’t keep physics on dead bodies. I realize it’s kind of intensive but there are quite a few games that have it so it’s not like it can’t be done on the current consoles or anything. They just don’t for some reason. BFBC2, HL2, Max Payne 2 and 3, GTAIV, Stalker, etc.</p>

            <p>yeah, the thing I loved about BC2 was that the player physics were so much tighter than the average modern shooter. They didn’t try to make it feel “realistic” in spite of immediacy and control. That and the weapon customization was WAY more balanced, and the attachment unlocking actually made fucking sense. Why the fuck would I spend an hour getting the same fucking sight for a rifle that I just got for another gun?<br>
AND YOU COULD SHOOT THE BODIES. YOU COULD SHOOT THE BODIES AND THEY WOULD MOVE, AND FUCKING BLEED. THAT IS FUCKING IMPORTANT.</p>
<p>The only thing BF3 has over BC2 is more vehicle variety and some more…actually… It’s so fucking weird. The BF3 maps are bigger with more cover for infantry, yet there’s more emphasis on vehicular combat in the game. Meanwhile, BC2 has huge barren coverless a huge emphasis on infantry compared to the regular BF game.</p>
<p>It’s so weird. Between BC2 and BF3 there’s the most amazing Battlefield experience that could ever be produced, yet they seem to get <span class="bbcode-i">just</span> the right things wrong.</p>

            <p>What they need to do with this new game is not to slap 10 filters over the graphics. And realize that the sun is farther away from the Earth than they think it is. BF3 was fun and I got my money’s worth of gameplay from it but I just don’t feel like buying another BF game right now. I’ll see how it turns out and decide from there but I’m expecting not to get it.</p>

            <p>The only people I know who didn’t like BF3 were CoD fans. The only real drawback of BF3 for long-time BF fans was the lack of real team-play - not DICE’s fault, of course, but BF3 attracted a lot of fans of other shooter series who aren’t used to working together with other human beings. The basis is there - squad system, voice chat etc. - but nobody uses it.</p>

            <p>Holy shit, the engine is fine. It already looks better than a lot of other games, you are complaining about BF4 for things that DICE has been known for doing.</p>
<p>Just because they don’t update their engine doesn’t automatically mean that they will turn into IW and pump stale games out.</p>

            <p>Battlefield 3 was one of the shittiest games i have ever played. Way too much hype with little delivery.</p>

            <p>No, of course I want improvements. CoD has been incredibly lazy when it comes to the engine. However, I’m more concerned about the gameplay than the graphics. I can live with an improved if not completely redone engine if they change the era. Modern shooters, besides Arma, are pretty boring nowadays.</p>

<p>What is wrong with Frostbite 2? It’s pretty heavily optimized (ultra slows down but high looks 99% as good and runs smooth) while still being one of the best looking engines of today. I doubt Dice will go down the road of making every new game look exactly the same graphics-wise. Even if it’s an incremental bump up I’ll be satisfied with it. They haven’t made four games in four years with the same exact engine, so I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, as I said above I think Frostbite 2 is the world’s best game engine. But if DICE get into the habit of releasing multiple titles in a single series running on the same engine without any significant improvements, a CoD-like scenario could result. Do you want a BF4 in 2013 on Frostbite 2 and a BF5 in 2015 on Frostbite 2.5, or a BF4 in 2015 on Frostbite 3? Frostbite isn’t an engine like source which can be continually tweaked and renewed for a decade and still hold weight - it needs significant amount of work to improve.</p>

<p>Now, unless DICE have been secretly working on Frostbite 3 intensively since BF3 was released, I don’t see BF4 using an engine any more advanced than FB2, maybe FB2.5 tops. Which isn’t great.</p>
