    <title>PC games you may have not played</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pc-games-you-may-have-not-played/3323</link>
    <description>These may be known games, but yet you just heard of it, and never gave it a try..You should, because they&#39;re more than what you&#39;ve read/seen about them


MY recommendation is : 


Blade the edge of darkness
Call of Cthulhu Dark Corners of the Earth
Penumbra
World of goo
Max payne (Ye ye, but yesterday a friend told me he never played it... :fffuuu: )


That&#39;s it for now  :stuck_out_tongue: , that&#39;s MY recommendation for YOU, do whatever you want with it, those may not be a MUST HAVE, but they surely are a MUST TRY...Afterall the point of this is to &quot;force&quot; you to atleast Try them =P

I didn&#39;t name many, then you guys can recommend too =P</description>

            <p>From the newest episode:</p>
<p>Sam: I wonder what’s in this wardrobe.<br>
Max: Don’t open it, Sam! It probably leads to a fantastical world filled with wonder and religious allegory!<br>
Sam: Good call, Max. We already wasted enough time poking around that tollbooth.</p>
<p>One game I really enjoyed despite not expecting to was Mount and Blade. It’s a “sim” sort of game where you’re put in a medieval world filled with absolutely NO magic whatsoever (hooray). You create an army of up to several hundred units, or even stay small with 17 or so, and then fight on horseback against bandits, looters, or if you’re daring enough, other nations. There’s a demo available that gives you a pretty good idea of what it’s like.</p>

            <p>Baldur’s Gate series = Best D&amp;D RPG ever. Fuck your graphics and 3rd edition ruleset. It is the only game I have ever played in which I choose my party members based more on their personality than on their skillset, and that’s what makes it a REAL “Role Play” Game.</p>
<p>Psychonauts = Best Platformer. It’s got Puzzles, Battles, Huge range of unique levels, solid core gameplay mechanics, quirky characters with deep and detailed personalities, and a great story some really cool twists. In short, it has everything.</p>
<p>Cave Story = Best Indie Game. PC version is Free, Wiiware version is updated from the ground up. Divergent Storylines, awesome gameplay mechanics, strong emotions and an EPIC hidden ending.</p>
<p>Sam&amp;Max = I played Secret of Monkey Island and had fun, but I had more fun on any individual episode of Sam &amp; Max than I did on any individual Part of SoMI, even with the upgraded interface of SoMI: Special Edition. Sam &amp; Max has 11 episodes already and is coming out with another 5 this year.</p>

            <p>:hmph:<br>
The point stands. <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">THIEF</span></span> did not create the stealth genre, <span class="bbcode-i">Castle Wolfenstein</span> did. Nor did it set the standard for the genre, as <span class="bbcode-i">Metal Gear Solid</span> did.</p>
<p>I’m sure the game is still awesome, though.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
