    <title>broken Skybox textures when map is compiled without HDR</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/broken-skybox-textures-when-map-is-compiled-without-hdr/15031</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

not sure if you are aware of this but when I compile my map without HDR, skybox textures get stretched and do not look as intended.
When I compile with HDR there are no problems at all.

Greetings...</description>

            <p>Maps should ALWAYS be compiled with HDR only. Our game does not support LDR.</p>
<p>This also has the advantage of reducing your BSP sizes and halving your compile times.</p>
