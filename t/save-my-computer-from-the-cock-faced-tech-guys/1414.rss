    <title>Save my computer from the cock-faced tech guys!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/save-my-computer-from-the-cock-faced-tech-guys/1414</link>
    <description>That&#39;s right, if this problem isn&#39;t solved within the next three hours, I need to bring it to Stonybrook Tech to get it fixed, so hurry up and help me!:fffuuu:

I need to connect to the Internet, but Stonybrook has a policy where you need to register it through an online program before you can connect.  But my computer doesn&#39;t want to.  First, it said that there was a problem with the Local Are Connection adaptor, and that&#39;s what I stumped the tech guy over the phone with.  We worked for an hour, until he gave up.  I then proceeded to fix that problem by setting my Internet option to automatically detect settings.

But, wait!  After that it couldn&#39;t connect to the server.  I fixed that by flushing/resetting the IP settings via the command prompt.  I&#39;m so close!  I am now receiving packets from the Internet!  

But I have one last problem.  It can&#39;t display the webpage needed.  Or any, for that matter.  It&#39;s designed to take you directly to the right registration page when you start IE, but not for me.  It recognizes when an address is typed wrong, but says that the Web Page can&#39;t be displayed.  I&#39;ve tried typing in the address, but still nothing.

I&#39;ve also swapped out different ethernet cords, but it&#39;s still fucked.  My roomates have no problem with the jack, though.

Please, help me!  What do I do!?

It&#39;s Vista, btw

            <p>I see this from “tech guys” in companies/establishments quite often. I honestly don’t see why they hire them half the time when they could hire someone who actually knows what they’re doing to get the job done instead. Even though I don’t (and don’t paticularly want to) work in tech help, what you did would be one of the first things I’d try simply from past experiences. This kind of problem is often more obvious than you’d think.</p>

            <p>Okay, so I really didn’t have access to the Internet to get your responses at hand (I typed from the library), so it’s not like I could see your responses…</p>
<p>However, as it turns out, it was my IP.  I just needed to set it to automatically get an IP address…was it that hard for the tech guy to figure out?  Motherfucker shouldn’t be giving out help if he can’t solve a simple problem.  I just assumed it was something major when he couldn’t figure it out.  Now I realize he just needs to get castrated.</p>
<p>Regardless, I registered my computer after fixing my IP, and now I’m posting from my dorm!</p>

            <p>Although it seems like you may have covered this already (with the command prompt stuff), did you have your PC set to a static IP before you plugged it in wherever you are now? I had this problem at a LAN a few years ago where I’d set my PC to take a static IP for my home network and then obviously, being the same LAN port, when I moved my PC to the place where the LAN was it wasn’t connecting (either because someone on the network had my IP already or because it was outside the range of IPs in the network).</p>
