    <title>FPS drops</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fps-drops/11225</link>
    <description>First of all, this is the most awesome mod i have ever played, NICE WORK!!!

But i experience som heavy fps drop&#39;s, it happens when i enter a new area, meet enemies or just when there is alot of action going on.. it can be as low as 20fps!? 

My setup are:
3930K@4.7Ghz
16GB Ram
HD 7970 Crossfire

I only play on one card, but why all this low fps? is it because its a earlier version of the Source engine? any settings/things i can do?

Thanks</description>
