    <description>In the April update, is there any particular reason why I&#39;m not able to add $treesway to some existing models, like models/props_foliage/mall_tree_medium01.mdl?  I should be able to locally have a VMT of the same name that adds those settings, right?  As a local test, for that tree specifically, I tried adding VMT in bms/materials/models/prop_foliage/mall_trees_branches02.vmt.  The vmt looks like this:




[code]VertexlitGeneric
{
$baseTexture &quot;models\props_foliage\Mall_trees_branches02&quot;

$AlphaTest 1
$AlphaTestReference &quot;.35&quot;
$nocull 1
$model 1
$FlashlightNoLambert 1
&quot;%keywords&quot; l4d2

$treeSway 2 
$treeSwayHeight 512
$treeSwayStartHeight &quot;0.5&quot;
$treeSwayRadius &quot;256&quot;
$treeSwayStartRadius &quot;1.0&quot;
$treeSwaySpeed &quot;0.050505&quot;
$treeSwayStrength &quot;0.020205&quot;
$treeSwayScrumbleSpeed 3
$treeSwayScrumbleStrength &quot;0.101&quot;
$treeSwayScrumbleFrequency 4
$treeSwayFalloffExp 5
$treeSwayScrumbleFalloffExp 7
$treeSwaySpeedHighWindMultiplier 6
$treeSwaySpeedLerpStart &quot;2.0&quot;
$treeSwaySpeedLerpEnd &quot;6.0&quot;
}[/code]But the changes don&#39;t show up in-game.  However, if I change aspects of this VMT (like disabling AlphaTest), the changes [i]do[/i] show up in Hammer.  So, I&#39;m confused.  I also tried this using leaves.vmt, which is used by bush01_dead.

I also tried doing this in bms/custom/(nameofmap)/materials/models/prop_foliage/mall_trees_branches02.vmt.  Didn&#39;t work.  There is no motion at all.


As a point of reference, I have a bushsm.mdl model in my test map which is blowing around as expected, as it does in the main game.

So, what&#39;s wrong?  Am I putting these in the wrong place?</description>
