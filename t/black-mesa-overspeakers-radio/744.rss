    <title>Black Mesa Overspeakers/Radio?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-overspeakers-radio/744</link>
    <description>I dont recall this being mentioned in the forums before but here goes;

Would it be out of place to have overspeakers around the facility? We have alarms being set off constantly, but no announcements made. There could be numerous broadcasting rooms dotted around the facility and has a different scientist to make quick statements over it (before swiftly dying). Would be a nice feature and could allow those with a crappy microphone to donate some voice acting to the project. 

On the other hand (if radios are used in this instance) it is a secret scientific base and they wouldnt neccesarily want people accidently tuning into their channel.

But as a whole I personally think its an idea worth adopting, it&#39;d add to the feel of the opening scene when Gordon walks into the reception, to have a voice broadcast the announcement:
&quot;Dr. Freeman, please report to the Test Chamber.&quot;

            <p>It’s an automated response, and there maybe some areas in the facility that are so far removed from ground zero that they might not realise what’s going on.</p>
<p>Also, it’s just to add a bit more atmosphere, after the RC the overcom could declare that the facility is damaged and that everyone should evacuate, but the message is riddled with static and the voice starts to deform and finally cuts off midsentence.</p>

<p>Anyway, back on topic, the announcements are being redone so far as I know, the volume of it will only be known when you actually play it. If you couldn’t hear it properly when you were playing it first time, then that was probably you some fault with your version or your computer or something like that. The voice system was fine for hearing for most other people.</p>

<p>That’s why. Maybe I misunderstood something, but I thought that when she said no changed, she meant no changes, at all. I mean I like the emotionless male voice that echos through the facility, I’d just like to actually hear it this time.</p>

<p>So, it’s not going to be made louder then? :[</p>
<p>Darn, I could never hear it in Half-Life. I would hear it like maybe 2 or 3 times, and even then couldn’t understand what it was saying due to it being so quiet.</p>

            <p>Radio broadcast was a topic a long time ago but nothing clear comes from it.<br>
Could be cool to have a fonction on the HEV suit to hear BMRF radio, military broadcast or even your own music like in Fallout 3 or the GTA serie.</p>

            <p>Half Life had the announcer (I think the folder was called VOX or something like that) so it’s most likely that BMS will have the same. I think it was discussed before the crash, so I don’t have any more info.<br>
Anyway, the announcer is going to be there, but about the radios, I don’t remember anyone mentioning them</p>

            <p>I dont recall this being mentioned in the forums before but here goes;</p>
<p>Would it be out of place to have overspeakers around the facility? We have alarms being set off constantly, but no announcements made. There could be numerous broadcasting rooms dotted around the facility and has a different scientist to make quick statements over it (before swiftly dying). Would be a nice feature and could allow those with a crappy microphone to donate some voice acting to the project.</p>
<p>On the other hand (if radios are used in this instance) it is a secret scientific base and they wouldnt neccesarily want people accidently tuning into their channel.</p>
<p>But as a whole I personally think its an idea worth adopting, it’d add to the feel of the opening scene when Gordon walks into the reception, to have a voice broadcast the announcement:<br>
“Dr. Freeman, please report to the Test Chamber.”</p>
<p>/Discuss?</p>
