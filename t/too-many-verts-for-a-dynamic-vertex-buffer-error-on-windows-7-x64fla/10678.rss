    <title>&quot;Too many verts for a dynamic vertex buffer&quot; error on Windows 7 x64fla</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/too-many-verts-for-a-dynamic-vertex-buffer-error-on-windows-7-x64fla/10678</link>
    <description>Just a little bit ago I had a game crash with the error:
&quot;Too many verts for a dynamic vertex buffer (34032&gt;32768) Tell a programmer to up VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE.&quot;

I&#39;m not exactly sure where I was exactly, I had just gotten to the surface and dropped down during the air strike inside the small cement shack, but with any luck the game dump will help. I also found an earlier thread on this same issue via Google, however it appears you guys have moved it elsewhere or something as it tells me I don&#39;t have permissions (after signing in also).

My system in case that helps with anything:
Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 (not OC&#39;d)
7 GB DDR2 ram
nVidia GeForce 9800 GTX+ 512 MB
Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS running using the kX Audio drivers
Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.
