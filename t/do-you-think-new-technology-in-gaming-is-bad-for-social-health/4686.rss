            <p>The way I see it, the kids that are obsessed with WoW and things like that now are the same as the kids way back when that were obsessed with comic books.</p>
<p>Those kids “escaped” into a comic book instead of socially-interacting.</p>
<p>It’s not the games (or the comic books) that do it.  It’s the people.</p>
<p>Same with violence.  It’s not that video games make one violent; it’s that violent people sometimes play video games.</p>

            <p>Mental skills are the same as physical skills. You stop training a muscle it will start to deteriorate, you stop working the part of your brain responsible for social interaction the neural connections will become weaker.</p>
<p>That said I personally believe games don’t neccessarily have this degrading effect, moreso the people who already have low social interaction seek out games. It’s perfectly possible to become completely socially inept by playing games, but if you interact with other humans normally it would be pretty difficult to do.</p>

            <p>Perhaps i could’ve included this in my previous post but i forgot:</p>
<p>The reason why I say what I say is because I used to be shy and socially awkward. Because of that I didn’t really like going to school and didnt like participating in social activities. I played World of Warcraft a lot and I liked it a lot because it gave me the option to get away of it all. Because i played world of warcraft so much I didn’t learn to handle my social awkwardness.</p>
<p>Two years ago i quit WoW. I got out more and my social abilities quickly improved. Within weeks i noticed i was less shy and talking to people got much easier. Nowadays i don’t notice anything anymore.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty much the victim of what Black Bob mentioned. At the least, it feels nice getting SOME interaction, but I should certainly be getting out more.</p>

            <p>I believe video games can have very negative effects on your social health. Some people are autistic or shy by nature, and they quickly seek entertainment like video games that do not require them to interact with others. The addictiveness of these video games (like world of warcraft, for example) makes the people who play those games play them for a long time. Because they spend such a long time playing world of warcraft, they don’t get out and meet people. This isn’t as negative for everyone, but shy people can only get over their shyness by participating in social activity. People who play World of Warcraft don’t get out, don’t participate in social activities and thus they remain shy and socially awkward for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>I believe the game itself does not harm them, but the fact that it keeps them from interacting with others (and thus getting over their social awkwardness) does not increase the quality of their future.</p>

            <p>well I wouldn’t pin it on any single game. Just using computers too much (regardless of what you do on the computer) is a sickness and an addiction.</p>
<p>Any obsession is defined by something which take over your life completely making you unable to function normally.</p>

            <p>Hell, I bet there was someone in the past that committed suicide because his sim got fired in The Sims or something.</p>
<p>Insane people are insane. It just so happens that insane people are usually socially inept as well, so they stay in a lot more. When you stay in a lot more, you need something to keep you entertained. A game is a perfect medium of entertainment. WoW happens to be great for those with a lot of time. Ergo: insane people that are willing to commit suicide over a game, play WoW more because they have too much time on their hand.</p>
<p>In short: WoW doesn’t make people insane, insane people just like to play WoW.</p>

            <p>Okay I was wrong. On the other hand, people KILL for videogames too. But that’s not really a big problem. Not for me, at least. Wait, that came out wrong. I meant that’s not a big problem for the gaming as a whole, because those people would’ve killed people regardless of games, considering you have to be metally ill to kill in the first place.</p>

            <p>Only the weak of mind.</p>
<p>I’ve played that game for 5 year and never ever did I have a hard time emotionally, physically or mentally. I didn’t put it in front of my social life, if I was in a raid and a friend called to go have a drink, I would leave the raid.</p>
<p>When it was clear I just didn’t have enough time anymore to play (compared to the cost to play… €12 to play 4-5 evenings a month), I just stopped playing.</p>
<p>If someone commits suicide because of WoW, that kind of person wasn’t in a healthy mental state and could have commited suicide because of certain events in CS or MW as well.</p>

            <p>Though that happens in CS as well. And any game. But WoW is far worse, considering it tortures people emotionally.</p>

<p>how would wii games ruin social interactions.<br>
As for as it goes they’re pretty much just ps2/gc games but make you flail like a tard.<br>
and WoW has probably been killing people social skills for a while now.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it have been killing people themselves.</p>
