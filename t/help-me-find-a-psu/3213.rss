    <title>Help me find a PSU?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-me-find-a-psu/3213</link>
    <description>A few days ago my computer just suddenly shut off, and I couldn&#39;t start it anymore.
I plugged in a PSU from a different computer, and the fan spun, from which I concluded that it must be the PSU. Also, there&#39;ve been a few power shortages in the last week or three.

I have no knowledge of PSUs except that I need about 500W.
To give you an idea of my requirements, here are my specs:

Motherboard: MSI P6N SLI V2
CPU: Q6600 (overclocked to 2.682GHz)
GPU: 8800GT
Two hard drives, two optical drives
No dedicated sound card
In addition to the CPU fan, two more are installed
RAM: 4GB


So yeah, any idea where I can start looking, or what brands I should get or anything? I don&#39;t want to spend too much money on it.

Thanks.</description>

<p>If it’s still under warranty why not have them fix it for you for free?</p>

            <p>So you’d rather have a broken PSU that you can’t use than lose warranty? Or am I missing something…</p>
<p>Anyway, I bought the Antec BP500U. Was either that or a 1000W one in the store I went to, and I couldn’t be arsed to go anywhere else.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>It doesn’t in my area, the power was out just 3 days ago due to high wind.</p>
<p>The point is, I actually do use my netbook whenever I’m typing something, the netbook is plugged to its own keyboard, mouse and monitor whenever I’m at home so it feels just like using a desktop. I do that not only because it’s more reliable and power failure proof, but also because I store everything important in that thing, I replaced the hard drive with a bigger one so I don’t need to cope with 8gb of storage, I have 250gb. Also I feel kinda stupid using an overclocked beast of gaming to run ms word.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>By the way, I hooked up my modem to the same 12v battery and it worked fine, I don’t know how long it would have lasted because the power was back on within the hour.</p>

            <p>As far as I know, it’s when the voltage of a certain area drops to a really low point; somewhere to where the power isn’t completely out, but isn’t enough to power most things.</p>
<p>I could be completely wrong, though.</p>

<p>Also, UPS are totally useless, instead of spending your cash on car batteries that don’t stop beeping when there’s no power at your house, so annoying, you could buy a netbook or something. Much longer battery life. My friend has a 900VA UPS and he regrets buying it.</p>
<p>When there’s no power at my house I charge my netbook with a pack of 9v batteries transformed into a huge 12v battery pack.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not everyone has [nor wants] a netbook.  When you have a desktop computer, which does use 120/240V and suddenly, there is no longer 120/240V coming into your house/office, that computer no longer works…unless you have it hooked to a UPS.  And if you’re in the middle of doing something and haven’t saved in the last few minutes, well, hope your memory is good so you can start over again later if you don’t have a UPS.  Unless you were using the netbook to start with, having a netbook wouldn’t help at all if the power goes out in the middle of something…</p>
<p>Additionally, while a netbook might be fine for light tasks or a movie or basic games, it still won’t get you online if there’s no power in your neighborhood (short of using wireless broadband).  Very few times have I experienced a blackout coupled with the internet connection also being out, even when lightning has struck within 1000 feet of the house and killed a transformer.  Now, I’m not saying I need to be online every second of the day, but as I’ve mentioned above, there are times when you need to be online for something work-related.<br>
For a home user, a UPS is probably not required, unless you experience frequent blackouts, brownouts, or other power issues.  My area seems to have more than its fair share of power issues, and I work from home, so for me, UPSs are not only useful, but a good investment.  I love mine and I always can use more of them…</p>

            <p>That was a pointless post, read the thread idiot :hmph: Then you’d realise that a) We’ve already suggested a Corsair PSU, and b) that we went one step further and suggested one with the right power output for him. 750? :facepalm:<br>

            <p>I think I’ll wait and see if these problems keep occurring. If it happens again, I’ll consider getting one, and I’ll get back to this thread to reread everything you posted.</p>

            <p>A UPS is external, so on a scale of 1-10 on difficulty, they’re a 0.  It’s a surge protector on steroids.  As for cost, a 350VA can be had on sale for $30 US, $40 or so regularly.  Each step up in VA adds $20-30.  If you buy online, be aware shipping may be expensive due to weight, even a 350VA is pretty heavy.  Also make sure you buy one made for your country’s voltage/plugs.  APC is the best brand IMO, though you may find cheaper models by competitors.  I’ve owned other brands, and I prefer the APCs…</p>
<p>I strongly suggest getting one as soon as possible, as power problems can and have killed computer parts on me, not to mention you can finish what you were doing and shut down safely should the power go out.  One day, I’d just finished editing some photos for work that needed to be in within the next few hours, when a branch fell down the road and took out the power lines,  Cable was still up, so I was able to save the last photo, then upload all the completed photos to my job, before shutting down, all without any external power.  Without a UPS, I couldn’t have gotten those photos in on time, as power was out for 8 hours, and I don’t do editing on my laptop.</p>

            <p>How expensive are those UPSs, and how hard are they to install?<br>
€80 is already a lot of money for me at the moment, and I’m not looking to spend a lot of time getting my computer running.</p>
<p>But hey, thanks for the advice.</p>

            <p>I tend to prefer Antec PSUs (I run an Antec 550W in my system with somewhat similar specs).</p>
<p>If you’ve got power problems, I strongly suggest also adding an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) (also known as a battery backup), preferably made by APC.  I have 8 UPS’s by APC, used for my computers, monitors, networking gear, and external HDDs.  Depending on what you need to run, (like if you have an LCD or CRT monitor), and how long you want to run it without external power, you should look into something in the 350VA to 900VA range (higher means longer runtime or more power for more devices, as well as higher cost).  If you use an LCD monitor and only want your computer to have enough power to safely shut down immediately upon power loss, a 350VA is probably plenty.  If you use a CRT, and want to be able to finish what you’re doing, you should look at a 500VA or higher.</p>
<p>My PC with similar specs to yours is hooked to one UPS, and is currently drawing 151W (17% load of a 1500VA).  My 21" CRT, GbE switch, and 500GB RAID1 external HDD are drawing 95W (11% load of a 1500VA).</p>
