    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-blue-shift/6899</link>
    <description>I think it was a great game, like HL except shorter and from maybe a little less interesting perspective! But what are you thoughts?</description>

<p>True.</p>
<p>Azure Sheep release date - August 31, 2001<br>
Blue Shift release date - June 12, 2001</p>
<p>But look…BS was good because of the story of Barney Calhoun…Azure Sheep was good in gameplay …</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like to consider Blue-Shift more of a DLC map pack, in which case it (in my opinion) does great. It was new stuff in an old packaging. It had some interesting new ideas and concepts, all whilst using almost exactly the same engine as the original Half-Life did.</p>
<p>And that’s something I really enjoy from mods: utilization. Do things that the original never thought about doing, yet had the ability to do all along.</p>
<p>Also, about Azure Sheep: I got stuck when I got to a door. Walking into it would produce the opening sound every milisecond, overlapping itself in a tedious ear grind. Eventually I removed the mod, only to later read that it was a CORPSE that was in the way. I’d had to smack the bottom right corner ofthe door to destroy the corpse before I could proceed. Then I cursed the mod and all it’s faults far, far away.</p>
<p>(<em>spoiler</em>)</p>
<p>My biggest issue with the mod was probably the part where you meet Gordon.<br>
1: The guard you are supposed to represent DIES in the original game! The original didn’t have that gaping hole in the ceiling that you fall through, but I can live with that. But this almost killed it for me.<br>
2: Gordon TALKS?! And he’s voiced by a french guy or something. Well that’s just great. I mean, I know “Freeman’s Mind” wasn’t made at the time, so they couldn’t have known to get Ross Scott, but still, I’d rather have him silent.<br>
3: Gordon is a reskinned security guard, and he’s an idiot.<br>
4: When he runs into that room where he gets knocked out, he would get stuck outside as the door closed on him. You could still hear him in there, but his model was just running in place until you left.</p>

</aside>
<p>Unless you continue that ellipsis with “that doesn’t actually matter in the slightest” I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>There is a big problem with gamers on forums expressing an over bearing sense of entitlement. There is no “expiration date” for making sequels in any medium, (toy story 2 &amp; 3 were released 10.5 years apart) in fact more games should probably hold off on making sequels. Some developers seem feel the need to crank out sequels on such a frequent basis that it seems like we never get a break from it. Can you honestly say you’d be more interested in another cranked-out Call of Duty sequel or a Psychonauts 2?</p>

            <p>As a kid, for the longest time i thought that Blue shift and OpFor were Valve games. I thought I was all knowing about valve games until someone told me that they were gearbox games.</p>
<p>Which raises the question, if it wasn’t for gearbox would half-life be as significant? Think about it, if BS and OpFor didn’t exist the wait to get our half-life fix would of been about 6 years till hl2. That’s plenty of time for fans to stop caring. Oh wait a minute…</p>

<p>Interesting, I never knew that. Kind of like Decay for the PS2 version. Speaking of which, has anyone ever played all of the way through Decay? I just started playing it again a month ago with my friend, but the server crashed halfway through, so we haven’t given it another go.</p>

            <p>It was okay, but not as good as Half-Life or Opposing Force. I was also quite disappointed with it, since I had already played as a security guard in Azure Sheep, which is a much better mod.</p>

<p>I think it was a great game, like HL except shorter and from maybe a little less interesting perspective! But what are you thoughts?</p>

<p>That’s why it’s so short and has no new weapons or enemies.</p>
