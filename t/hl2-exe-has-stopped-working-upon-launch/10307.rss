    <description>So apparently I get this whenever I try to launch BMS -

Problem signature:
  Problem Event Name:	APPCRASH
  Application Name:	hl2.exe
  Application Version:	0.0.0.0
  Application Timestamp:	470c11ae
  Fault Module Name:	shaderapidx9.dll
  Fault Module Version:	0.0.0.0

This is with 3 different installs of BMS and I&#39;ve tried to do alot of the fixes which has been posted in the past. Like starting and stopping the  wmiprvse.exe / repairing the same service and updating my video card drivers nothing seems to work. Plenty of my other Source engine games are working except this. Any help would be much appreciated since I&#39;ve started to pull out my hair on this one  :frowning:</description>

            <p>I fixed it! Taking from the official steamforum</p>
<p>my cz go was crashing because of shaderapidx9.dll this fixed my crash.</p>

<li>Gain ownership of C:\WINDOWS\SYSWOW64\WBEM\FASTPROX.DLL and assign yourself Full control of the file if necessary.</li>
<li>Rename FASTPROX.DLL at this location to FASTPROX.DLLOLD</li>
