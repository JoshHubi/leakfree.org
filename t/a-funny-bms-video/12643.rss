    <title>A funny BMS video</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-funny-bms-video/12643</link>
    <description>Hi! I just got the mod and I love it so far  :smiley: 

I made a video of it here, if you want to check it out: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hYvDuVRBvM[/url]

I decided to try my hand at doing a let&#39;s play of sorts, but I wanted to do it a little differently. I had a lot of fun exploiting little cut-away gag opportunities while editing this, so hopefully its enjoyable  :slight_smile: 

Let me know what you think, I can always use feedback since I&#39;m new at this! If you want to see the rest of the game feel free to subscribe ;D

Thanks,
-CaptainGoodstuff</description>

            <p>Black Mesa is as much a Valve game as any other Source mod based in the HL universe. As far as making money from the BM videos goes, you’ll have to wait for their permission, but that page you linked has all the info you need, otherwise.</p>

<p>Hint: No, no it’s not. I don’t see how you conclude that a game not developed by Valve was developed by Valve.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I did ask if it is “technically” a Valve game, as in Valve owns the characters and such and is mentioned in the credits. So then, am I allowed to simply credit the creators in my description with the website link (as I have) or do I need to link a more formal document?</p>

            <p>Oh also I have a question. Am I allowed to monetize this video (and the rest of the series) of me playing the game? Is it technically a Valve game? If so, I assume I just need to show this to Youtube: <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/videopolicy.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.valvesoftware.com/videopolicy.html</a></p>
