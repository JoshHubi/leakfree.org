    <title>Half Life Backstory == Valid?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-backstory-valid/4363</link>
    <description>I just stumbled across this piece of work as being redirected from the combine overwiki. Sure, I know that the overwiki has issues with anything involving conjecture and cannon beta vs non-cannon beta material, but could I get any consensus on whether there&#39;s any supporting evidence that this backstory for Gordon Freeman wasn&#39;t pulled out of some reviewers ass?

[url]https://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HLGameInfo.Detail&amp;id=5&amp;game=4[/url]

The main thing that rubs me raw with this is that the article mentions that the Half Life story was written by Marc Laidlaw, but fails to mention if this particular article was also written by him, or if any of it is even still considered cannon, as many initial storyline plans have been struck from &quot;canon&quot; since changes to backstory may need to be made depending on what the storyline requirements of future games are.
On a personal level, I was surprised that this backstory is claiming that Freeman never even touched a real firearm in his entire life, but the training section in HL has you using firearms, and the combat requirements of the game(being able to, for numerous different weapons, shoot accurately and reload efficiently, and do it better than trained military) are such that I can&#39;t even imagine how someone without ANY experience with ANY firearms would be able to adjust at that speed, genius level intelligence or not. Even if it was just target or skeet shooting, you&#39;d think he&#39;d at least have had SOME experience.

At the very least it should make for interesting discussion point.</description>

            <p>Ok the end result is that he has no helmet you can see he doesn’t have one in the model of HL1  and in my post just down in my signature is a link where the actual model of Gordon In HL2 is, and by the shape of the head you can see no helmet … it is a game for crying out loud nothing has to be completely logic … we might say that Gordons helmet was lost and that they made him special glasses that display the HUD as if he was wearing the helmet …</p>

<p>On topic: I like the HL universe as it it: mysterious and contraversive. I don’t wan’t to understand everything about it, cause obviously that would ruin the whole mysteriuosness thing and all.<br>
As to the helmet debate, I go for no helmet.</p>

            <p>Of course it doesn’t change the fact, because it’s not a correct fact. You never see gordon freeman (yourself) in any of the official valve games, you never see the HEV suit from behind in any of the official valve games, and those times you see the HEV suit in the official valve games ON someone else, it has a helmet, ergo, the helmet itself DOES EXIST.

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Yes, you CAN discuss the helmet issue relying on logic because a simple and logical reason EXISTS.</span> You don’t question if the blue stuff that is above you is the sky, there aren’t arguments proposing the idea that it’s water that just happens to be breathable and look like air, or if it’s actually a giant TrumanShow-style cage that surrounds the area. The simple and logical reason for why the stuff above you looks and acts like air is because IT IS AIR.<br>
The reason why that is different from being able to take endless damage from bullets, or why Freeman can carry endless amounts of ammo and weapons without being burdened down or encumbered is because no simple and logical reason really exists for those cases. <span class="bbcode-b">It’s only AFTER no simple and logical reason exists that you start putting features of a game into the “Video Game Logic” category.</span></p>

See? That visor area wraps around the head almost to the ears, so it could easily be to or past the edges of what would be visible on the in-game screen. That’s not even counting the fact that human eyesight tends to sorta wash out extraneous details that aren’t part of what you’re focusing your attention on. Neither does it consider that Gordon Freeman wears glasses, which can’t correct any deficiencies in your/his peripheral vision, hence Gordon likely is used to looking through his glasses and not focusing on what is at the edge of his vision.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That wouldn’t really resolve anything, it’s not unusual for a girl to kiss the helmet of the victorious champion. You see it all the way back from knights in full plate armor to motocross rallies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And here a question for a common sense logic - in HL1, Gordon can stay endlessly on Xen without draining Oxygen, yet in HL2 he drains O2 under water very quckly… Why? Some downgrade in technology between Mark IV and V?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Xen may have a toxic, but breathable atmosphere. I don’t recall anyone actually saying what the conditions were like there. In which case the helmet of the HEV suit likely has a built in gas mask, but a gas mask does nothing for breathing underwater.<br>
It also might be the result of having the Long jump unit, which is also missing from the Mark 5 HEV suit.<br>
There also very well might be a downgrade of technology in the Mark 5, seeing as how the Mark 4 was developed in a fully funded research facility, whereas the Mark 5 was likely rebuilt from the Mark 4 with whatever technology could be scrounged up while hiding from the dominion of the Combine Overwatch.<br>
So there you go, not just one, but THREE possible explanations that are all pretty simple and logical.</p>

<p>If I went with my breathable, but toxic atmosphere idea, then it’s possible that he’s only alive for a short time and will eventually die from the toxins.</p>

<p>Yes, but you’re misinterpreting ease of play for the gamer with developer’s intentional disregard for logic.<br>
…<br>
But the helmet issue is entirely different.<br>
…<br>
In fact, the only thing that conflicts with the assumption that he has a helmet is the concept artwork, and that doesn’t even REFUTE the presence of a helmet, only that if there is one, it is detachable and is less photogenic than Gordon’s face, which only makes sense anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t understand why is the helmet issue different? Why is Half Life different from other games? Why is suddenly every aspect of the game put on logic test? Those are simply FPS rules that are valid in many other FPS games - how many games you have where you get shot all over the body, including head, without having a helmet?  Also in how many games, INCLUDING HALF LIFE you get instant heal? Why aren’t you crippled when your wounded, how are you able to take tons of bullets and heal all the time? If Nip/Tuck thought us anything, it’s that human body cant be endlessly repaired… You can’t discuss the helmet issue relying on logic, while excluding other aspects of the game out of it. Some aspects are simply relying on FPS VIDEO GAME rules, while others are comparable to common sense logic, such as the story, characters…<br>

<p>“We Are Not Alone” &amp; he was without a helmet. If you turn around in Half-life, you don’t see shepard.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>In blue shift you see Gordon being dragged by to marines though a small bunker window. (again not sure of the name of the chapter)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s a reference, not a any proof of canon. Also note his lack of a helmet. Also, you don’t see barney, even if you noclip.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>The g-man says to Sheperd he well be preserved for another time.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He says “detained.” Which means that he may or may not come back. Also no guarantee of canon in the slightest.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>As for the helmet issue, in op4 you see him with his helmet while he is jumping into the portal, but you don’t see it while he is being dragged by the marines in blue shift.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually, he’s without it both times.</p>

</aside>
<p>I can see that you’re wrong or irrelevant on multiple accounts. The only real things that tie the games together are the nuke &amp; the name “Barney Calhoun.” &amp; everything else proves that he doesn’t wear a helmet.</p>

            <p>Well, I can solve the point of this thread by saying that the backstory may not be canon, but the fans invent the canon in a star-trekkian or star-warsian kind of way.</p>

</aside>
<p>You seem to be a little confused as what canon is exactly. Just because Op4 and BS included mentions of events from Half Life 1 don’t make them canon, it just means they’re REFERENCING material that is canon. Events from BS and Op4 only become canon when they are specifically referred to by an official Valve produced game or source, and even if individual events are qualified as canon that way, that canonization does not automatically extend to the entire game as well.</p>

<p>Again with the helmet conspiracy? There’s no way to tell for sure. You can’t base the facts on real life, as I already said.<br>
Care to explain then, where does Gordon keep all weapons he gets through the game? Crowbar, pistol, SMG, Crossbow, Rocket Launcher, Gravity Gun… Maybe in his magic helmet, with some rabbits?<br>
Just stupid, give it a rest already.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, but you’re misinterpreting ease of play for the gamer with developer’s intentional disregard for logic.</p>
<p>Yes, it is strange that Gordon can carry 20 different weapons, some that are nearly as big as himself, and still fit through airvents with enough room to use any of them and switch between them. Unless the HEV suit has some Pocket Portal/Dimensional space system that allows him to store his weapons in portable black hole(which is actually plausible, even if a bit cheap, since the suit came from black mesa, the top lab for interdimensional research) there isn’t ANY logical way that this would be realistically feasible, so the only other explanation is Valve fudged the laws of reality to make things more enjoyable for the player.<br>
But the helmet issue is entirely different. Gordon has resistance to damage from headshots, has a HUD display and crosshairs, Oxygen reserves for going underwater (when you stay underwater until your oxygen/aux drains, you start taking damage. When you surface, your health regenerates and your oxygen/aux regenerates too, but when you dive again, you’ll still continue the damage you took from drowning as long as there is still oxygen/aux power in the suit) you can survive being bathed in radiation which shouldn’t be possible if your head was exposed, and you can hear the suit giving feedback and the flashlight always aims wherever you are looking, but doesn’t move when your arms do, implying that the light locus is from your come across numerous other corpses with HEV suits exactly like yours but with helmets. It is completely unrealistic for Gordon to be able to do all of this without a helmet, but unlike the weapon issue, this case HAS the simple logical explanation that HE IS WEARING A HELMET.<br>
In fact, the only thing that conflicts with the assumption that he has a helmet is the concept artwork, and that doesn’t even REFUTE the presence of a helmet, only that if there is one, it is detachable and is less photogenic than Gordon’s face, which only makes sense anyway.</p>

<p>"ok firstly there was no helmet when you saw the suit for the first time in its pod or what the hell was it secondly Gordon is always depicted without a helmet and thirdly in Half-Life 2 you see the suit AGAIN no helmet "-Kerberos. Well actually your right and wrong. There’s no actual proof of this. Also when you get into your suit the first time you also don’t see your gloves, and obviously you see them with the hand animation when you handle pistols in-game. So if that is true, THEN it would make sense that he were to be wearing his helmet which would explain his HUD &amp; crosshairs, etc. Another inconclusive piece of evidence would be if you took an accidental dip into radiation, without the helmet you WILL die. I’ve seen it happen before with only minor dosages of it and its quite scaring. (not in person though, behind closed doors, a lawsuit followed in the following weeks after it happened). With all those small clues, it would make more sense that gordon wears the helmet in-game…</p>

<p>Well, the HEV probably has some kind of servo-motors in the leg part so when activate the sprint feature, his motors activate and synchronize with your running enabling you to run faster.</p>

The story, back on track now, it is weird since you just pointed that out. The suit most likely does the work(already explained the helmet part), and gordon merely just points and pulls the trigger. But what really interests me is that regenerative battery in the Mark V suit in HL2, how the Sprint feature works, but that is another forum then.</p>

<p>Of course, some user-made wiki that’s largely constructed from wild speculation can exercise total authority over words from the guy who’s writing the plot line.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I happen to be a Combine OverWiki admin, and we’re not some poorly build, speculation based fan site. We delete any speculation that is not backed by large amounts of believable evidence, and even then, it goes deep into the trivia sections.</p>
<p>We take canon quite seriously too, and have contacted Laidlaw himself on several occasions regarding canon, and source any other already-revealed pieces of info, as seen by these pages: http:<a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/OverWiki:Canon" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/OverWiki:Canon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Retcon" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Retcons</a></p>
<p><a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Gearbox_Software#Canonicity_of_the_Half-Life_expansions" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Gearbox_Software#Canonicity_of_the_Half-Life_expansions</a></p>
<p>With regards to Opposing Force and Blue Shift, Marc Laidlaw confirmed that he asked the Gearbox team to incorporate the destruction of Black Mesa into the plot, so that Half-Life 2 didn’t suffer from “creative death” by returning there. Laidlaw also had some involvement in Barney Calhoun’s part in Blue Shift, giving Gearbox clearance to use him to better connect the Half-Life 1 anthology with Half-Life 2, but only have him referred to by “Calhoun”, just in case there is future contradictions. In addition, Adrian Shephard has been mentioned by several Valve employees, saying that they’d like to bring him back if he fits with the story.</p>
<p>So, from all of that, the destruction of Black Mesa, by extension the nature of the Black Ops’ mission, Barney’s part in the Black Mesa Incident and Adrian Shephard are all confirmed canon. The rest of the Gearbox material is “canon until stated otherwise”, or “vague or ambiguous canon”, as it were.</p>

<p>The helmet argue - stupid if you ask me, you can’t base your facts on real life - how can he see the hud, or take bullets in the head without a helmet? If Gordon was depicted with a helmet on every artwork, he would look to threatening and non-human (kinda reminds me of Darth Vader from the planet Vulkan in Back to the Future xD )… Pure marketing reasons. He doesn’t ware a helmet, yet he acts like he is. Or its invisible. Or might be removable and portable to fit in a pocket. Doesn’t matter. Don’t forget your talking about a video game, some contradictions with real life are possible, duh.</p>

<p>You don’t even need to assume contradictions, in those scenes of concept/advertising artwork, you just need to assume that his helmet fell or was knocked off in whatever tussle he was in last.</p>

<p>I know this post is a little old, but I’m pretty sure they didn’t. If I remember correctly, you pick up the SMG from the military. Same thing with the pistol and crowbar. You get the former from a dead guard and you find the latter just sitting on the ground. Not that that really matters in the context of this thread. I was just throwing that out there.</p>
