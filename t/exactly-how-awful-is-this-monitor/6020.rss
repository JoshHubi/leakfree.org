    <title>Exactly how awful is this monitor?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/exactly-how-awful-is-this-monitor/6020</link>
    <description>Ok, currently got a 19&quot; wide LG, 3,000:1 CR, 2MS response. I just want a bigger monitor. And i noticed this:

[url]https://www.novatech.co.uk/novatech/prods/monitors/26inchplusmonitors/novatech/lcd28f.html[/url]

The actual brand of the screen is Hans G/ Hanspree or something. Now, i&#39;m not expecting the same quality as those 30&quot; inch dell monitors. But i watch alot of movies and TV from the computer, and play the occasional game.

Suits my needs? Or avoid at all costs? 

Opinions please guys  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Yeah exactly, from what i’ve read, HDMI is just DVI with audio when it comes to using it on a PC.</p>
<p>It comes tomorow, i’m gonna run it side by side with my 19"  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>what would you have used HDMI for? I mean, I don’t have a console, and probably won’t in the near future, so I was going to pay a hefty extra for a port I probably wouldn’t use. My dilemma was having an hdmi port, or saving £60 and getting a couple more inches. Obviously I skipped the port.</p>
<p>The monitor looks great mate, the response time on them these days isn’t really noticeable, it has pretty good contrast too. Just gotta set it up right first, mine defaulted all fuzzy, so be aware</p>
<p>This is the biggest monitor I’ve owned by 3 inches :3 It’s impressive  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>The one in your first post is on sale on OverclockersUK. This week only £235</p>
<p>Unless you really need an HDMI port (I didn’t), this is a nice low-price option. I have one.</p>

            <p>There is no difference between 2 and 3ms, and 28" is way bigger than 24, also the first one was higher res.</p>
<p>But I would probably be able to find a cheaper one with similar specs.</p>

            <p>I’ve never gone wrong trusting reviews. If it’s got an average of 4 or 5 stars, I’ll read all the reviews and see what people say its pros and cons are, and if it sounds good to me I’ll get it. It’s pretty safe to ignore the worst reviews since they’re usually overblown because the reviewer is either impossible to please or is angry because of a DOA product or something. Just look at the highest and middle reviews to base your decision on and you should be good.</p>
<p>Anyhow, as far as existing reputations go, Hanns G makes pretty good monitors, they usually get pretty high ratings on newegg, they just seem to be decent, no-frills monitors. Hanspree I don’t really know that well, and I’ve never heard of Iiyama. But as long as this Novatech place has a good RMA policy, no decision should be too bad, right?</p>
