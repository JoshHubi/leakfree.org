    <title>Stuck trying to exit elevator to test chamber [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stuck-trying-to-exit-elevator-to-test-chamber-fixed/9847</link>
    <description>I got stuck trying to exit the elevator down to the test chamber near the beginning of the game.  I could not move (I could use the mouse to look different directions) but I could not jump, crouch, etc.  I saved the game and tried reloading, but still stuck.  I quit the game, reloaded, and tried again:  same issue.  I ended up restrting the game and then got past this issue.

Just thought I would report it--Love the look and sound of the game guys--great job!   :smiley:</description>
