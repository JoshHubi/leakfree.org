    <title>Source Filmmaker in Black Mesa?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-filmmaker-in-black-mesa/8994</link>
    <description>Following the release of Meet the Pyro, we all know that Source Filmmaker is now released as a beta. I was wondering if the Black Mesa team will be able to implement the replay system into Black Mesa Deathmatch and implement Source Filmmaker into Black Mesa.

I&#39;m not very sure if the SFM team will be releasing the codes for the replay system, but to be sure I sent them an email.

Maybe with SFM, The Devs will be able to make a better intro/teaser for Black Mesa&#39;s release.</description>

            <p>Well the source filmmaker is like 5gb, because it supports from the 2005 to the 2010 source engine maps ressources etc. I’ve loaded a zombie panic source maps, and models which are with the 2007 engine and i’ve got no bugs or anything. Also source filmmaker have good depth of field and motion blur and even ambient occlusion, and it have advanced motion editor so that will be nice to do a trailer or even a teaser with it!</p>

[COLOR=‘SlateGray’]grey player model idling in a trailer? That’s the spirit to make a new trailer with a <a>COLOR='Black’</a>release date for black mesa!</p>
<p>No, really. SFM source engine is more advanced than most of the mods source engines, I doubt we will see a hl2 mod vid done in SFM in a looooong while unless it becomes compatible</p>

            <p>If you guys wanted to do a trailer for the game, the easiest way to do it would be with a combination of actual game play demo recording, demo smoothing, and putting point_viewcontrols in maps to watch certain scenes, with env_zoom to zoom the camera and a path_track to control the panning speed and direction. I’ve rigged up cameras to look like handheld footage for my mod this way, it’s not all that hard to do  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I know I’d love to make a Black Mesa trailer with SFM, but only when I’m sure that I can’t contribute to any area of development - certainly don’t want to hold up release for that sake.<br>
Of course, I feel like getting everything working there would require a lot of copying/pasting assets into the right directories, and then figuring out why X isn’t working…</p>
<p>Maybe my trailer will just be the Heavy calling the Scout over and saying “Look! Black Mesa is released!” in poor sentence-mixing.</p>

            <p>Valve has already stated that the SFM will be able to use assets from any source game and you can use it to render films from that material. They even went as far as to say that you can use it to make money from your videos as long as you aren’t using any of Valve’s material. That says to me that it can be used with anything under the sun. It doesn’t need to be implemented in to a game, the assets from said game need to be implemented into SFM.</p>

            <p>Yeah, once SFM goes public I’m pretty sure they’ll add the ability to use other source game assets.</p>
<p>But right now you can import assets from other games or mods via copy and paste.</p>

            <p>You can’t implement SFM into Black Mesa because SFM is a tool on its own. There isn’t even a Valve game with SFM. All the choreography is done by the given tools in the Source SDK. SFM can only be used to make prerecorded videos that can be replayed but not in game because cutscenes are not in the nature of neither Valve nor the BM team.</p>

            <p>SFM is currently only officially supporting TF2 (but with a brain and at least one working eye you can get other assets from other games) though I believe with time, the game will ask which game you want to use upon startup, and at that time will load the assets for that game, and allow your actor player model to be different from simple TF2 characters.</p>

            <p>well sfm started as a form to make tf2 trailers but now Valve can use it for more things like portal and such… yet I don’t think black mesa will use SFM…</p>

            <p>Out of the box it only TF2 assets but you can import any you want. The fact that most people have taken the lazy option shouldn’t be a surprise.</p>
