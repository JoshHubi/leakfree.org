    <description>I know this is the official Black Mesa forums, however the dev team usually hangs out over at the [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/) forums as well as [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/592595839600558080/592595840040828940). 

If you are looking to report issues with the game, you are best to report them at either of those locations.</description>
