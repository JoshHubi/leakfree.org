    <title>Brainstorming for Deathmatch Maps</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/brainstorming-for-deathmatch-maps/12941</link>
    <description>Please excuse me if this belongs elsewhere, I know this thread focuses on actual development.

Assuming there will be an SDK and  map integration for whatever new engine the retail/presumably deathmatch version will have, what do you guys want to see in community content? Please post your ideas here. 

I know myself that I have several ideas for maps to include. Currently, I&#39;m working on a Source &#39;13 map centered on Black Mesa (just in case). Any other preliminary proof-of-concept maps that are made can be posted here, and if anyone with the time and motivation to do this makes one, I will gladly post on this head post.

Please keep criticism constructive and don&#39;t derail. Thankfully, the mods here are great, but try to self-regulate just in case.</description>

            <p>I think that Power up is ripe for a deathmatch conversion the corridors and layout are fantastic, I would love to see the two main maps combined without the huge vertical shaft.</p>
<p>Also the trip mine warehouse from surface tension and courtyard would make an excellent multiplayer map but without all the tripmines and have proper entrance exit doors.</p>
<p>Lambda core crate yard where you meet the black ops assassins for the second time would also make a great multi player map little would need to be done here on this one.</p>
<p>These three maps basically before Gordon reaches them in their pristine state and perhaps a bit modified.</p>
<p>I would even say Textsfamguys train yard would make a good multi-player map he did for OAR uncut</p>

            <p>What about a map set in an area never seen in half-life? Maybe the interior of the hydroelectric dam? Some catwalks for vertical difference and generators for cover maybe?</p>

<p>Xen platforming with lots of portals and varied vertical combat?</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, considering that the BMS team is trying to fix the bad aspects of Xen, their interpretation could allow for some nice death-match potential with the low gravity enabling you to sneak up on someone who’s higher up than you, &amp; the use of portals for ambush. Plus, the varied vertical combat would presumably be better implemented.</p>

            <p>How about a pit? Full of snarks?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, though, I’d love to see a DM map in the open desert, with only some rock formations and a drainage tunnel network for cover.</p>

            <p>From what I’ve heard, it’s movement system is much floaty and faster paced, more similar to hl1 than hl2. That’s what I’m basing my level design and level maneuverability on.</p>
