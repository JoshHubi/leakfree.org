    <title>Saving the 2 guys being shot by sniper. [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/saving-the-2-guys-being-shot-by-sniper-fixed/10215</link>
    <description>Around the mid-point of the game you will come across an open area, with a guard crawling towards a med-kit, after a moment a doctor from the building on the other side of the area comes to the help of the guard, and ends up being shot by the sniper.

I saved them both by shooting the grill where the sniper is with a rocket launcher, the sniper died. 

I&#39;m reporting this as a bug since I believe we shouldn&#39;t be able to kill the sniper.

There was no dialogue with the doctor, pressing E on him just made him turn his head a little and then back. Saying nothing and just staying there.</description>

            <p>You need to kill that sniper to proceed.</p>
<p>Even giving the scientist a generic line would help fix this though</p>
