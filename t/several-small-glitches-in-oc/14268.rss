    <title>Several small glitches in OC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/several-small-glitches-in-oc/14268</link>
    <description>So, I recently started up Black Mesa again and encountered a few smaller glitches.
I also don&#39;t know if any of these have been reported yet as I didnt have time to read through all submitted bugs
(Sorry for not following the bug reporting guidelines, I made the screenshots, etc before reading through them or else I would have included map names and coordinates)
Sidenote: my playthrough of BM was on the newest version on a new save file

First Map of OC

1. The Menu
First off: The font in the loading screen is messed up. Have no idea what causes it but I think the menu should and will be improved either way sometimes in the future.

2. The Radio transmission
Not sure if its a bug or intended, but the radio at the start of OC only played the evacuation transmission once, making the player miss around 90% of its content (which is sad as it is pretty interesting)

3. OC Guard #1
The Guard you rescue from his zombified buddy got stuck in my playthrough and I was unable to get him unstuck, except for release him from his suffering.

Second Map of OC

4. OC Guard #2
The Guard you encounter at the beginning of the second map of OC is supposed to shoot the single headcrab in front of him. Instead, he just shivered and barely aimed at it sometimes. He followed me after I killed the headcrab, but refused to shoot any other aliens, instead simply strangely shivering when there was an enemy nearby.

            <p>The weird thing is that I see the same reluctance to fire the .357 initially but after that the guard is usually fine firing his weapon.</p>

            <p>That last bug seems to be a problem with the .357 magnum itself, NPCs are no longer able to shoot it, they just go through the motions. Can also confirm NPCs getting stuck in such situations (including the exact one reported) as number three. And agree on number two.</p>
