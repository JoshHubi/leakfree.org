    <title>sv_pure not working + bugs + suggestions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sv-pure-not-working-bugs-suggestions/14057</link>
    <description>Hello,

Let&#39;s get straight to the point.

I will list only a very few bugs that bother me right now and make a few suggestions.

Bugs:
Sv_pure is not working.
Game has HUGE performance issues client side when a lot of players are online, low fps, freezing, etc on fairly high end PC; GTX 780 + fx8350 @ 4.7ghz.
Sometimes the rpg dot of other players is visible thru walls.

Suggestions:
Add motd, it&#39;s useful for a whole bunch of reasons including but not limited to; displaying stats, displaying rules, streaming music.
Allow spectate for individual players &amp; display their names, don&#39;t switch the target we spectate when they die, let us watch who we want, we sometimes don&#39;t spectate people for fun.
Add spectators to the scoreboard, we can&#39;t see who&#39;s online &amp; watching us.
Add *SPEC* tag to chatting spectators, not *DEAD*.
Spawning takes too long, people are complaining, allow server owners to disable that CS:GO like death screen via cvar so players can spawn faster, we don&#39;t like waiting to spawn more time than we spend playing.
MP3 files don&#39;t work as sounds, only .wav works.... .wav is much bigger in size, allow .mp3
Encrypt in game chat.

I may update / reply to this post in the future with new stuff.</description>

            <p>We will look into some of these features. Performance issues will be resolved in the upcoming patch.</p>
<p>MP3s do not work because we could not afford to license the module which uses them. Use oggs, instead.</p>
