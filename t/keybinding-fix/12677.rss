    <title>Keybinding fix</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/keybinding-fix/12677</link>
    <description>Update: Version 2 available. Extract everything to the corresponding listed folder in the &quot;BMS&quot; section of your computer&#39;s Steam directory.

This removes some unusable key-bindings &amp; addresses some complaints.


* Quick-switch Gravity Gun key-binding removed
* Weapon Category 6 key-binding removed
* Send/recall squad key-binding removed
* Duck-Jump key-binding added
* Direct-switch bindings added for every weapon.

Version 2 changes:


* Added the &quot;quick melee&quot;, &quot;quick grenade&quot;, &quot;duck toggle&quot;, &amp; &quot;adrenaline&quot; improvements from Sjakal&#39;s key-binding fix. Also added the autoexec.cfg for these to work.
* added Sourcegamer101&#39;s options menu/English-language game-play interface fix

<p>I dunno where you found the +duckjump keybind; I made my own. In the bottom of scripts/kb_act.lst I have a keybind action +jumping which corresponds to a cfg/userconfig.cfg alias +jumping and -jumping. While held down, normal +jump is started and +duck is toggled on, until the player lets go of -jumping where -jump is fired once along with -duck so they are disabled again. See those files for more info.</p>
<p>It may take some time figuring out exactly which aliases are fired when a keybind action is fired (from the bottom of scripts/kb_act.lst), but it’s working just fine on my end. Also, go ahead and try the quick crowbar or quick grenade keybinds. I created their keybind aliases +melee and +grenade in userconfig.cfg as well. They are, as you stated, NOT standard Black Mesa keybinds; I made my own.</p>
<p>But remember, as stated in the readme, you need both the userconfig and the kb_act files in place and the new keybinds mapped (at the bottom of in-game keyboard options) otherwise nothing’s going to happen. And if you want to use skill_sjakal.cfg you have to add it to scripts/skill_manifest.cfg first (I should clarify that in v04 if I ever make one). OK I’m done, sorry for barging in on your thread.</p>
<p>I hope my userconfig.cfg will explain things and prove useful. If not feel free to post in the thread I linked to a few posts above.</p>

<p>Forgive me for sounding like an idiot by asking this, but I’m guessing “duck toggle” lets you stay crouched without having to manually hold down the crouch key? Also, I found the stock crouch-jump key-binding code by a simple lucky guess. 1 day, in the console, I typed “bind”“enter”"+cjump" in the developer console. After turning it off, I hit “enter” to see if it worked, &amp; it did.</p>

<p>Your “quick duck jump” uses the wrong binding code (it’s “+cjump”, not “+duckjump”). I added quick-switch keybindings for each weapon to avoid using something like your “Quick Weapon”.

<p>The Fast weapon switch works fine for me. It’s just that it still shows the inventory HUD as you’re switching. Additionally, “walk” works fine if you have “Always Run” enabled.</p>

</aside>
<p>It should be in the “Scripts” folder. In case it isn’t, I’m gonna make a zip of this later tonight. As for the weapon names, I based some of them on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 0.357 is referred to as a “Colt Python Elite” because that’s the model of revolver it’s based on</li>
<li>“MP5” is short for “MaschinenPistole 5”, which is German for “Machine pistol model 5”. Heckler &amp; Koch is the company that designed it</li>
<li>I based the Shotgun’s designation on the weapon’s full name as listed on the side</li>
<li>“GAM14B” comes from the model designation listed on the RPG’s HD pack model in <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 1</span>. SCHEATGM-4,000 refers to the ammunition used, &amp; is short for “Shaped-Charge High-Explosive Anti-Tank Guided Missile-4,000”</li>
<li>“Mark 2 Defensive Fragmentation Hand Grenade” is the official designation for the “pineapple” grenades</li>
<li>“M23B” is written on the trip-mine’s HD model. The word “L.A.S.E.R.” originated as an acronym for “Light Amplification By Stimulated Emission of Radiation”</li>
</ul>

            <p>Nah, that’s exactly it.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is an interesting fix, I didn’t know this was even present. They went through the trouble of removing unused HL2 code, figured they probably already did this as well. Regardless, good work.</p>
