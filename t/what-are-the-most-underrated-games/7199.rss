            <p>Far Cry 2. Yeah, it had some problems, but it was also one of the most immersive games I’ve ever played, and I award very high points for that.</p>

            <p>these are under rated probably more because of them being small name indie games / nobody has played them, but under rated none the less</p>
<p>The Void (probably one of the hardest games i’ve played)<br>
Winter Voices</p>
<p>also the original Witcher, yeah it got good reviews and awards, but i’m still surprised at how few people have played it.</p>

<p>Anyway, one of the most underrated games of all time is…</p>
<p>Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines.</p>
<p>Also, Killzone 1 was an unbelievably underrated title for the PS2, and still imo stands as one of the best FPS for that console.</p>
<p>Oh, another…</p>
<p>ACT OF WAR.</p>
<p>Oh and…</p>
<p>Evil Genius.</p>
<p>Oh and…</p>
<p>Deus Ex I.W.</p>
<p>Oh and…</p>
<p>Tachyon the Fringe.</p>
<p>Oh and… I’l leave it there because I could go on all day.</p>
<p>Game history is full of underappreciated gems that simply got swept under the rug because of the industry always putting too much emphasis on the ‘AAA’ titles, which has pretty much always been the newest FPS to come out and do nothing over the past decade.</p>
<p>One of the few exceptions being Half-Life.</p>

            <p>I didn’t see it, I thought hey this guy can’t be that much of a stupid shit and checked for hidden text.</p>
<p>Why do people on this forum expect people to check for black text? It’s annoying.</p>
<p>So on topic, Mount &amp; Blade is pretty under-rated.  Not in terms of like reviews or people thinking its shitty but like a lot of people don’t know about it (I suppose this is the deal with indie games and not having advertizing). If you like open world / sandbox type rpg games M&amp;B is a must play. I bought the first one some time back for 5$ some of the best 5$ I’ve spent.</p>
