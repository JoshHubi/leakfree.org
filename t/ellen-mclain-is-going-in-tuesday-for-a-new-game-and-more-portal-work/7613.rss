    <description>That&#39;s what John Lowrie (her husband) said on [url=&#39;https://twitter.com/#!/johnpatricklowr/status/98284898976145409&#39;]Twitter[/url].

I wonder what new game she&#39;s working on. Could be Dota 2 but there&#39;s that tournament going on so I suppose the voices are done by now.</description>

            <p>Well, I’m not really into DoTA type games so if the “new game” is DoTA2 I wouldn’t get excited but if it’s something else then I will. Either way Portal 2 DLC is exciting on its own.</p>

            <p>I do remember hearing her voice as the background lady that alerted the combine whenever Gordon trips any sensors or gets ambushed by them. If you didn’t get that she usually said “Priority Warning! Intrusion in sector…” &amp; in the citadel when all the weapons get zapped &amp; the gravity gun gets an overcharge turning blue. I don’t know what role she would play in episode 3 since the combine SHOULD be cut off from the overworld &amp; I’m sure dragging around their propaganda speakers would just slow the combine down, I mean that is what I would think they would do. She might be doing some last minute voice work in DoTA2 since lip syncing is usually less tedious work compared to the other stages of development cycles for the most part.<br>
^(The only exception to that would be for anything Bethesda releases on that horrible Gamebryo engine…the one Fallout 3 &amp; Vegas uses[correct me if I got the name wrong], it’s soo unreliable &amp; the emotionless character faces bug the hell out of me. I bet the thought of ladders makes them scared since it can’t even handle that without jumping through loading screens)</p>
