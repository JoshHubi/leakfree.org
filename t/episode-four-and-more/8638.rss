    <title>Episode Four and More</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/episode-four-and-more/8638</link>
    <description>[COLOR=&#39;Black&#39;]I&#39;ve already posted this at GameFAQs Episode Three board, and it got ignored. So I&#39;m posting it here because some people actually do visit this forum.

So, as we all know, Episode Two ended on a cliffhanger. A cliffhanger that doesn&#39;t allow room for the sequel to be a major installment - like Half-Life 3, just because it would disrupt the narrative flow - having to resolve the previous game&#39;s loose ends before continuing with the new game&#39;s story, mechanics and environment - or whatever happens after the Borealis. So, the next installment in the Half-Life series can&#39;t be a game which stands on its own - it&#39;s tied too much to the previous installment.

But we also know that it&#39;s been long since Episode Three. Too long, in fact, for just Episode Three. It can&#39;t possibly be that a single episode, which takes around 6-8 hours to play through from start to finish, takes 4.5 years and more to develop - even if it includes new tech and features like the previous episodes did. Even though we were promised a trilogy of episodes, that was a long time ago - and we&#39;ve grown to shake off that promise, more so with the news that a long time ago Episode Four was developed by EA, and the old news the Valve no longer supports the Episodic model. The next installment probably isn&#39;t an episode.

So, with two possibilities down (&#39;Only Episode Three&#39; and &#39;Only Half-Life 3&#39;), this leaves us with three other possibilities, only two of which I&#39;ve heard so far:
A. The first one is that Valve isn&#39;t actively developing the Half-Life franchise. This is very unlikely, as the company was built upon that franchise, it still has an active and devoted fan base, and the Half-Life franchise was always a catalyst for a change. Every time a major installment in the series comes out, it brings with it new technologies, new ways of interacting with the player and the environment, and breathes fresh wind for Valve and all of its IPs. Such a thing cannot be easily dismissed, especially with nothing to trigger it.
B. The second is that Valve is developing Episode Three and Half-Life 3 at the same time, and will announce Half-Life 3 as soon as Episode Three is released. This is very unlikely, as even if they were developed simultaneously, Valve should&#39;ve still released Episode Three a long time ago. Also, it doesn&#39;t make sense for Valve to spread out when it is very aware of the &#39;Valve Time&#39;, and the decision not to make players upset - something that is bound to happen once they&#39;re spreading out and delaying the release of their products.

The last possibility, which I haven&#39;t heard yet, is this:
C. Valve will release Episode Three alongside with Episode Four, and maybe even Episode Five in the same pack. It will do so because the episodic model has failed, but it has already far passed the point of no return as to how to arrange the storyline. Doing so will give the episodes the bigger overall scope they were hoping to achieve by ditching the episodic model and developing for several years, while still maintaining the Half-Life 2 + Episodes continuity.
This also has another advantage. In all of the other episodes, you&#39;ve had only one goal from beginning to end - in Episode One it was &#39;Escape the Citadel&#39;, and in Episode Two it was &#39;Stop the Super-Portal&#39;. It is not far fetched to assume future episode(s) will continue the same trend - with Episode Three being &#39;Reach and Explore the Borealis&#39;, Episode Four &#39;Topple the Combine Rule&#39;, while Episode Five may take place in the Combine Homeworld, finally ending the Combine Saga started by Half-Life 2. This all makes sense story-wise, but it can only happen in a multiple episode format, which Valve doesn&#39;t support since, at the very latest, the May 9, 2011 interview with Develop Magazine [wiki check]. The only option is to release a fully fledged game, and divide into multiple pieces.
This is also supported by the evidence that EA was developing Episode Four between the release of Episode One and Episode Two, only to be canceled shortly after Episode Two&#39;s release. The storyline of the Half-Life 2 saga was indeed supposed to be grander than just three episodes, even though we were only promised a trilogy by Valve - but since Valve doesn&#39;t support the episodic format from, apparently, late 2007, all work on the episodes has moved in-house, just so the saga can be completed and all of the remaining episodes could be released in tandem, so they would be identical in name but practically, they won&#39;t adhere to the episodic model of distribution.
However, doing so will not present a new engine to replace to Source engine, like everyone is hoping for by the long wait. It will instead improve upon it, and will pave the way for Valve to develop a new engine for Half-Life 3 in the future.

CLARIFICATION: THIS IS ALL SPECULATION.

So, I think that the last option is the one that will come true. It makes sense and has far less gaping holes than the other theories out there as far as I can tell. So I just wanted to throw it out there and hear some comments about it.</description>

            <p>Well I want Valve to continue the HL series BECAUSE of the gameplay, not really for the story (which is also really good).</p>
<p>FPSs have stagnated since HL2 came out, we really need HL3 to come along and revolutionize the genre all over again, just like HL1 and 2 did.</p>
<p>Valve is probably just waiting for next gen, which doesn’t bother me at all. I think a new Half-Life entry should come out with every new generation, to show all the other devs how shits done, then Valve can focus on their other franchises while other devs play catch up.</p>
<p>And if Valve really wants HL to die? I’ll accept their decision but they had better replace it with another amazing single player FPS franchise. We need Valve’s innovation to keep this genre fresh, and I’d like to think that’s not just the fanboy in me being ridiculous. I haven’t truly enjoyed a FPS since HL2, and that was fucking YEARS ago at this point.</p>

            <p>I think by now Valve has too many unique franchises to spend too long on any one of them. Portal, L4D, Counter Strike, DOTA, Team Fortress, and of course Steam itself. Given the rate of artistry and the way my own GMod channel works, I’m willing to bet they still have plenty more ideas we’ve never even heard of. Continuing a franchise solely for story, not gameplay, is not the way they work anymore.</p>
<p>Tldr; Half-Life is near dead, but Valve is still awesome.</p>

            <p>Actually I don’t think that the cliffhanger ending of EP2 stops them from making HL3. The advisors are gone, it’s not like it ended in the middle of a fight. You can practically imagine what happens in the next hour, and it’s not very gameplay-friendly. (<span class="bbcode-i">“oh, my god, Eli!” and “Thank God you two are ok.”</span> )</p>
<p>I can totally see a new installation of the franchise starting a little later, say on the way to the Borealis. Alyx is still a little shaken by the events, yada-yada… perhaps the g-man summs up the events in a few words (<span class="bbcode-i">“the death of her father was a deep sac-c-c-rifice…”</span>) and from there it’s a new storyline.</p>

            <p>Or let’s take it the other way. ValvE will promote a brand new game at E3 because they wouldn’t pay for private rooms (far more expensive then open ones) just to promote games that are already nearing a release. They will present something, and that something will be big. However, that doesn’t mean ValvE will spit out a next Half-Life installment. They can be announcing anything, such as hundreds of Portal 2 DLCs (oh God…,) the mentioned above new source engine, or a new game that can be anything. Team Fortress 3, Counter Strike 2, Portal 3, or even a new Half Life. The speculations can go forever and so I guess we’ll have to wait and see until ValvE shows its fat tasty ass in E3 and tell us exactly what they are planning.<br>
Also, originally Half Life 2 was supposed to have no episodes, it was supposed to be one gigantic game. However, ValvE decided that making separate games will increase the amount of details and therefore it was decided that episodic format would be implemented.</p>

            <p>Doug Lombardi has said that there aren’t any plans for a new engine, so they aren’t spending time to develop a complete new engine. They upgrade Source. Just like they did for every other game. Recently they have put a new shadow system into CS GO, which makes it look 10 times better. Who rushes all the games they can sell with the Source Engine? I didn’t see any next to L4D2. Valve is famous for taking their time to develop games, for experimenting with ideas and long playtesting.</p>
<p>Dota 2 and CS GO are already in beta. There are thousands of gameplay videos in the internet. There is no need for a presentation as they have already done enough. Portal 3 and L4D3 are also possible with the current engine. They would just update it again.</p>
<p>Half Life 2 was also presented in a private room, like they have rented on the E3.</p>

<p>Nope…</p>

<p>Yes but actually EA and Valve had a few disagreements in the past months with origin and the EA games being removed from Steam, I don’t think they will cooperate any time soon anymore.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>Huge wall of text</p>

</aside>
<p>No way at all they would do that.</p>
<p>They are just making Source² thats what takes so much time, meanwhile they rush the release of all the games they can sell with the Source engine, its business. Source² will allow a new generation of Valve’s games like Portal 3 and L4D3.</p>
<p>At the incoming E3 I dont think they will say anything about the half life game, they will focus on promoting DOTA 2 and CS:GO. After those 2 are released, I can’t imagine anything but a grand showdown of the Source². What game would they make first using the new engine ? HL3.</p>
