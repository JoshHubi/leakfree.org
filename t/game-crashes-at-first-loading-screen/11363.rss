    <title>Game crashes at first loading screen</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-at-first-loading-screen/11363</link>
    <description>When I get to the first loading screen the game freezes, doesn&#39;t get past that screen. I have to go into task manager to quit out which says hl2.exe not responding. Have uninstalled and reinstalled and still get the same problem. Couldn&#39;t find a mdmp file either so unable to attach that. Anyone able to help?</description>
