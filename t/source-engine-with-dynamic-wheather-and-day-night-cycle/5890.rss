EXTREME DINOSAURS FTW!

The look reminds me of Borderlands.

<p>It would be pretty funny when you get up to the part with the slow teleport where Kleiner says you were gone for over a week, now that time really would make even less sense than it already did. Or, as JeffMOD said, when Ravenholm takes place during the day &amp; looses a lot of it’s effect.</p>
<p>Making a mod of HL2, just to add this effect seems really pointless, especially when you can only appreciate it when it’s moving really fast.</p>

<p>Just gotta decide on locations to do it/ for it to work.</p>
<p>Ie. HL2 Episode 2 at the start where the train has crashed is set at night time, when you view the citadel it’ll look beautiful, and by the time you come out from underground it’s daylight again.</p>
<p>but then you start creating problems, such as the ant-lion fight out room is mainly lit by daylight, so youll have to create custom lighting etc.</p>
<p>At the end it’ll be worth it though.</p>

            <p>See, Valve can make this any time they feel like now, because they implemented a fully dynamic lighting.<br>
It’s only a matter of time before A ) they make a game that doesn’t have a time-based storyline (ie, HL2, Ravenholm wouldn’t be nearly as hard-hitting during the day) or B ) They release the new version of the engine for modders to use and they use it to make a day/night cycle.</p>
<p>I can’t wait.</p>
<p>That said, I’m sure this workaround looks just as great. Loading video now.</p>

            <p>nope, not exactly.<br>
he heavily modified the default rtt shadow shader, he made a uniform shadow mapping shader out of it and now it seems he got perspective shadow mapping to work</p>
<p>EDIT: still uniform shadow maps, I just asked him</p>
