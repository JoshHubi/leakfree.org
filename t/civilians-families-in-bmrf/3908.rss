    <title>civilians/families in BMRF?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/civilians-families-in-bmrf/3908</link>
    <description>I was just thinking: seeing as everyone in Black Mesa lived with their family (if they had one) what would the military have done with them?
Say Azian (yes I know she was a scientist, but she was also the mum of a 1 year old) was trying to escape with baby Alyx, and ran into the HECU, would they have really shot them? or would they have killed Azian and rescued Alyx because she was just a baby, or something?</description>

            <p>A long time ago, I wrote a story and first few maps of a mod (seems to be my trend, story and a map or two) where you played as Gordon Freeman’s dad (lol, yeah, dumb, I know) who was visiting.  I built a very nice covert-type entrance facility and stuff, but it was reaaaaallly in depth, mad shit and all, you picked up a radio transmission about half way through and went back to help Eli and Kleiner get out, but then you got caught in a portal event as they were getting out on a jet, and forced to fight your way through the sigma labs (which were suspended in a magma pocket, and specialized in time porting).  Unfortunately, you fucked them up and got ported around a bit, to several renditions of the sigma labs, at different states of post and pre-disaster, before completely messing it up, and the Gman stepped in to pull you back to your time.  You then took an escape sub out as the facility was falling apart, and escaped to the jet (Kleiner, barney, and all them came back for you).  On the jet, some weird shit went down, and then a portal storm hits and your jet crashes in eastern Europe.  The g-man pulls you out at the last minute, leaving HIS suit with the Black Mesa gang (which turned out, by some temporal mind-fuck, Gordon’s suit, explaining (for me) how the hell it got to eastern Europe along with Eli, Kleiner, Barney, Magnusson, etc).</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah.   uhhhhh…  Yeah, the military shot at him.</p>
<p>I’m totally going to start this back up if/when BM comes out, lol.</p>

            <p>It was a clean up job, they would have killed everyone becasue that would have been their orders. some may not have, but they themselves would probably have been terminated aswell. (massive interdementional coverups are serious buisness.)</p>

<p>They probably would have shot both of them. They may have shot Azian, because she did die in the facility. It’s possible that there was a daycare centre, and that it was close to or on the surface, and Alyx survived as a result of being there, but if the HECU came across a bunch of kids, I expect at least some of them would shoot.</p>

</aside>
<p>Alyx survived as a result of G-Man “plucking” her from Black Mesa. However, Eli, Kleiner, Magnusson, Barney and others survived Black Mesa as well, so it could be that G-Man simply ensured their survival. That means other children may have survived as well, perhaps with help from the aforementioned adult survivors. The soldiers were there to destroy BM and eliminate any witnesses, though, so I’m fairly certain that they would have killed anyone there regardless of age.</p>
