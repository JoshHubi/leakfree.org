    <title>Quenching your BMS Thirst.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/quenching-your-bms-thirst/9195</link>
    <description>So this game is getting closer to release, possibly... it might even be released by THIS Christmas, failing that, maybe before March next year, So what are you going to be playing to Quench the much needed thirst of BMS withdrawal?

I&#39;m tempted to get a PS Vita, a pre-owned one is under £200, and there is a few nice games for it, obviously by March next year there will be more. I dont know if anyone has seen TearAway, from the Media Molecule guys who made Little Big Planet.

Check it if you like that sort of thing: [url]https://youtu.be/iaYDNN3VbRQ[/url]

As an illustrator its quite interesting, problem is I&#39;m more of a fussy gamer these days, I hate certain things the gaming world has come to be, like all these mini games and such you can get on tablets, phones, chrome, facebook, quickly churned out games often lacking depth or artistic value, not always but mostly.

I&#39;m also a bit reluctant to play portable games, as im not the kind of person to play games whilst out and about, i dont need to game when im away, it would probably be more a home console, just on the toilet lol, I&#39;ve also gotten bored of PC gaming, mainly because i have to use a laptop and im not interested in having to update often as it means loosing money each time and im a student.

May go out of my way and get Guild Wars 2 if it runs on my Dell, might have trouble. 

So, as broad a question can be, What are you going to play in the next few months leading to the (possible) release of BMS?</description>

<p>Because you can give this one <span class="bbcode-i">reacharounds</span>.</p>
<p>Also this appears to be more of a linear puzzle game than a minigame collection. Totally different things.</p>

            <p>Dunno. Maybe trying to complete some games that i started and never completed. Like FEAR. And those addons for Q2. And Diablo 3. And about three dozen others.<br>
6 months later ROTT will come out (hopefully), so its multiplayer will keep me busy for a long time.</p>

<p>So what’s everyone elses plans for gaming over the next 6 months?</p>
<p>Anyone play many Source / UDK Mods? It’s the only thing i really play on PC when i get round to it, but most are often multiplayer based and only active (If at all) for 2 hours a day. Like Goldeneye Source, Come to think of it its a little disappointing how many (Total Conversion) mods dont make a release and it upsets me because it’s really the aspect of PC gaming i love to see. I think most people on sites like MODDB run before they can walk, they have the enthusiasm and talk about how amazing their mod/ideas will be, often get started, do some artwork which is sometimes good, then its silent and hear nothing about it for ages, then its status turns to ‘dead’.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, its such a demanding industry the only outcomes are the ones that have investment behind them, the bar is so high for realism and wide platforms it often cuts out a lot of the interesting and fun experimental stuff.</p>
<p>Like that game, The Unfinished Swan its probably gets a little repetitive and boring, but its probably built on abstract concept that managed to get funding and turned into a real game.</p>

            <p>The only way to quench the thirst of playing a remake of a classic game… is with other classic games…</p>
<p>I’ll play F-zero and Descent 1 &amp; 2… maybe some more dos games with dosbox.</p>
<p>after i’m tired of those… i’ll play pong</p>
<p>and after that space invaders</p>
<p>and after that pac man</p>
<p>and…</p>
<p>You get the idea… i think… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>So this game is getting closer to release, possibly… it might even be released by THIS Christmas, failing that, maybe before March next year, So what are you going to be playing to Quench the much needed thirst of BMS withdrawal?</p>
<p>I’m tempted to get a PS Vita, a pre-owned one is under £200, and there is a few nice games for it, obviously by March next year there will be more. I dont know if anyone has seen TearAway, from the Media Molecule guys who made Little Big Planet.</p>
<p>Check it if you like that sort of thing: <a href="https://youtu.be/iaYDNN3VbRQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/iaYDNN3VbRQ</a></p>
<p>As an illustrator its quite interesting, problem is I’m more of a fussy gamer these days, I hate certain things the gaming world has come to be, like all these mini games and such you can get on tablets, phones, chrome, facebook, quickly churned out games often lacking depth or artistic value, not always but mostly.</p>
<p>I’m also a bit reluctant to play portable games, as im not the kind of person to play games whilst out and about, i dont need to game when im away, it would probably be more a home console, just on the toilet lol, I’ve also gotten bored of PC gaming, mainly because i have to use a laptop and im not interested in having to update often as it means loosing money each time and im a student.</p>
<p>May go out of my way and get Guild Wars 2 if it runs on my Dell, might have trouble.</p>
<p>So, as broad a question can be, What are you going to play in the next few months leading to the (possible) release of BMS?</p>
