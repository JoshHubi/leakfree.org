    <title>Anyone else know about Concerned 2?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anyone-else-know-about-concerned-2/8551</link>
    <description>Just finished Concerned again. Just as bummed out as last time.  :frowning:  So I searched around found this website [url=&#39;https://aconcernedrip-off.webs.com/&#39;]Concerned 2: the continuing adventures of Gordon Frohman[/url] and thought you guys might like to know about it.

Sadly it hasn&#39;t updated since late 2010, with no updates on what&#39;s up. :[ But, I&#39;m trying to get traffic back up to the website, in an attempt to gain the creator&#39;s attention. I&#39;ve used the contact button to try to message him, but I don&#39;t know if that will do any good. Any help would be appreciated to get in contact with him, maybe at least get him to say goodbye. :&#39;(</description>

            <p>Yeah, I followed that for a while back before it died, and I’m assuming he’s not planning on continuing it any more, unfortunately. Shame, it was fairly entertaining while it lasted.</p>

            <p>Thanks for telling us! I checked the last few pages, not as good as the original concerned, but I think it’s ok. Btw, a different guy is doing this it seems.</p>
