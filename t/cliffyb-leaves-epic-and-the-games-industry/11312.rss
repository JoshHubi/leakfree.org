Today we are saying farewell with warm regards to Cliff Bleszinski, who is departing as Epic’s design director to chart the next stage of his career. During the past two decades, Cliff has helped shape many successful games that have captured the imaginations of millions of players around the world. We are grateful for his influence on Epic’s legacy, from the wild adventures “Jazz Jackrabbit” to the visceral combat of “Gears of War.”

Said Tim Sweeney, Epic’s founder, CEO and technical director, “In 20 wonderful years with Epic, Cliff Bleszinski has grown into a true design luminary, and his contributions to the ‘Unreal’ and ‘Gears’ series have helped shape the game industry into what it is today. Cliff leaves Epic with our gratitude for his many contributions, and our wishes for continued success in the next chapter of his life!”

“In my 10 years of working with Cliff, his passion for creating video games of the highest quality has been unflinching. We are grateful for all of his hard work, and remain committed to making our fans happy and to always raising the bar in everything we do at Epic,” said Epic Games President Dr. Michael Capps.

“Cliff has been my friend and business associate for the past 20 years and, while it is sad to see him move on from Epic, I know that everyone here has benefitted greatly from his passion for gaming and the depth of his expertise and experience,” said Mark Rein, vice president of Epic. “I’ll miss watching his star shine from such a close vantage point but I’ll still look forward to watching his continued success.”

We would also like to share an excerpt from Cliff’s personal note to his colleagues:

I’ve been doing this since I was a teenager, and outside of my sabbatical last year, I have been going non-stop. I literally grew up in this business, as Mike likes to say. And now that I’m grown up, it’s time for a much needed break.

I will miss the projects, the playtests, the debates, and most importantly, the people. Epic only hires the best of the best, and it has been a joy working with each and every one of you on a daily basis, whether you were hired weeks ago or decades ago. I have been fortunate enough to collaborate with a variety of disciplines, from code to art to marketing and PR – it’s been one big, rewarding learning experience. I’m confident that each project that is being built, whether at Epic, Chair, PCF, or Impossible will be top notch and will please gamers and critics alike.

We wish Cliff the best with his future endeavors.

            <p>Unreal is one of my all time favourite shooters, the only Tournament variants I liked were UT99 and (to a lesser degree) UT2004. I actually don’t want Epic to make an Unreal 3 because I just know they will fuck it up somehow, the game needs to be made by people who really understand what made the first one so great.</p>
<p>The game is just so bloody atmospheric. You can almost feel the cold breeze on your skin while running around in the Na Pali evenings and nights, sound effects and music have a big say in this, not only the lighting.</p>

            <p>I would rather have them do an actual Unreal game because they already have such interesting lore thanks to the backstory the UT series provided, a new single player Unreal game could be pretty much anything.</p>
<p>What I don’t want is a new Unreal Tournament that has little variation in the actual gameplay and is basically a remake of a game they made over a decade ago.</p>
<p>Hell, an Unreal game could HAVE it’s multiplayer be essentially UT, but they could have the single player/coop be completely different and new.</p>
<p>I mostly want a new Unreal game to have the same atmosphere that the original did, while doing something different for the gameplay.</p>

            <p>I loved UT3, although it’s not as good as the others it was still pretty good. The huge open maps were pretty fun, but as someone stated earlier it was too gears-esque. Also, why didn’t they start Unreal Engine 4 with Unreal Tournament 4. It’d sell like hot cakes, unlike this Fortnite crap which seems pretty boring other than being the UE4 starting game.</p>

            <p>Not surprising, kinda saw this coming.<br>
If you watch his recent interviews, he blames himself for a lot of the problems with games todays and games made by epic, and how gears of war turned out after first one. He seemed really frustrated in how epic started mass producing titles, and how little original ideas the were pushing. Doubt he will be back anytime soon, i think he burned out.<br>
Also he did just get married.</p>

<p>I totally thought you were being sarcastic. CliffyB and Epic Studios are about as well known as they come, especially since the Unreal Engine is one of the most widely distributed game engines this generation.</p>
<p>It’s like saying you don’t know of Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk of BioWare fame (who will also be sadly missed), or Ted Price, or even the pompous Peter Molyneux. But not nearly as bad as saying you don’t know who Gabe Newell is.</p>
<p>Also Google and Wikipedia are your best friends…</p>

            <p>I very much doubt he’s out of the gaming industry forever, christ what would you do after over 20 years making games? He’ll get bored in no time.</p>
<p>That said though I haven’t played a really decent game using the unreal engine in years, and the Gears of War series imo isn’t anything to write home about, especially when you consider the back bone of the developers succumbing to making it a one gun game at the whining of gnasher users.</p>
<p>I bought GoW3 after playing the beta due to them actually including the other guns. Then a few months down the line they throw all of the balance out of the window because a few whiners who can’t adapt bitched endlessly. An absolute joke.</p>
<p>I mean, other than GoW what else do they do? They swept UT under the rug. He probably left from sheer boredom.</p>

            <p>I liked UT3 because the gunplay and movement felt closer to UT99, rather then the “floaty” mechanics of UT2003/2004 which I wasn’t particularly a fan of, but it had so little content in general, and some of the designs for the weapons were just flat out odd.</p>
<p>Add on top of that the fact that what little content they had, there was only a couple of “good” things, when the other games had a ton of content on release that was good, and couple that with the strange visual style, that hurt it a lot.</p>

            <p>I like UT3 well enough. The only really AWESOME maps in UT3 are still DM-heatray and VCTF-suspense(which were the demo maps) though. Everything else seems fairly blah. I wouldn’t even care if they made a new one like UT3 though, I mean, it’s still Unreal.</p>
<p>Really, I think the art style did it in. Deck wasn’t even fun in UT3 cause everything looked exactly like everything and was painted in the exact same color. Atleast that is what I remember thinking, it’s been a long time since I’ve played any of the unreal games. Might have to fire it up later tonight.</p>

            <p>The point was that you want to work on Unreal. You could shoot AAA titles out of your ass, and Epic would toss you for mentioning making another Unreal game. They’re still butthurt cause UT3 was a bust.</p>

<p>lol,  I’m not a real cocky person, so I’d probably try and undersell myself and work my way up to working on the Unreal series.</p>

<p>I totally thought you were being sarcastic. CliffyB and Epic Studios are about as well known as they come, especially since the Unreal Engine is one of the most widely distributed game engines this generation.</p>
<p>It’s like saying you don’t know of Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk of BioWare fame (who will also be sadly missed), or Ted Price, or even the pompous Peter Molyneux. But not nearly as bad as saying you don’t know who Gabe Newell is.</p>
<p>Also Google and Wikipedia are your best friends…</p>

            <p>I’m actually considering working for Epic once I graduate high school and college, only so I can bring Unreal and Unreal Tournament back. I think Epic is actually hiring somewhere near here.</p>
