    <description>Here&#39;s a question for you, how the hell did they escape?

the tram was gone, the walkway too the tram was gone, kinda, and there was no other visible way out. how did they manage to get out of Black Mesa?

How do you think they got out?

post serious or funny opinions.

(Gordon) so how did you guys escape? (Kleiner) &quot;A Leprechaun magically appeared and said he would save us, but one of us would have to give up a leg, in return... Eli drew the short straw.&quot;</description>

            <p>GMan saved Alyx from Black Mesa; I’m inclined to believe he helped Eli out too. I personally think every main character who “conveniently” meets up in City 17 has been guided by GMan, though not always knowingly. I think the GMan wants to interfere with whatever his plans are as little as possible.</p>

            <p>A soldier is patrolling the area. He sees them and shoots at them. He misses using up his clip. Being his last clip and dropping his pistol he chases after them. Kleiner slides under a blast door that is closing to seal them from a lever the soldier pulled. Eli is making his way crawling under while the soldier grabs his leg. Kleiner is pulling at his arms while Eli is kicking himself backwards with his other leg. He pushes off on the blast door with one leg but the other leg was still under being pulled by the soldier. The door crushes his leg.</p>

<p>My main point was that overall our perception of the universe could be incorrect, and thus our understanding through experimentations on what we as a whole perceive could be entirely wrong.</p>

</aside>
<p>Now, do you agree that this assertion is similar to this one: “The screen I am looking at could be just an utter illusion and could actually not exist”?<br>
If no, then you are not coherent.<br>
If yes, then your main point is a triviality.</p>

<p>Also again. Just because I take the view that nothing is ever certain, as it clearly isn’t, doesn’t mean I have to live my life bound to that idea, I just accept the possibility.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Everyone here accept this possibility, but I am pretty sure you don’t give it as probability or credit as me or blushot. That’s why the assertion “our understanding could be entirely wrong” is either a bit arrogant or a triviality.<br>
Because, if you do think there is a appreciable probability that our understanding is completely wrong, then you must be fully aware of what you are calling into question, you must have studied science, or it will just be bar talk.<br>
Otherwise, you could as well say there is a tiny chance for our universe to be ruled by an invisible-undetectable pink unicorn with superpowers. Yep, true. Cool.</p>
<p>I can’t help but comment what follows. Blushot will certainly do it better than me, though.</p>

<p>What do you mean by “Dark matter is beyond our understanding”?<br>
If it is: “we don’t know what it is exactly yet”, then okay. So what?<br>
If it is: “we will never be able to understand it”, then it is irrationnal and ridiculous.</p>

<p>I wonder if you are aware that, when a scientist says something has been proved, most of the time it does not mean it has been proved theoretically, but by <span class="bbcode-i">experiment</span>! I am starting to think that some philosophers, when speaking about science, have the tendency to focus on theories and disregard experiment… That’s what Feynman said, anyway.</p>

</aside>
<p>No. My main point was that overall our perception of the universe could be incorrect, and thus our understanding through experimentations on what we as a whole perceive could be entirely wrong. I’m not saying it is, I’m not poopooing what you’ve been taught or the education you’ve recieved. I’m merely stating a fact you literally cannot accept because of your own percieved intellectual worth, and the importance said worth has on your mental well being, in this case your need to be right.<br>
It’s something I was taught by someone with a degree in philisophy, so because you haven’t been taught it you can’t comment.<br>
( Annoying, no? )</p>
<p>There is nothing I don’t understand about any of your arguments, nothing. Just because I brought up a point which you believe attacks your intellectual worth you immidiately assume I don’t understand. It’s shocking really.<br>
So because you’ve gone through the process and you’ve met others who’ve gone through the exact same thing (wow, people on your course agree with you, what a shock. ) you know ( and to an extent demand ) what I should think?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>If you feeled belittled, it’s because you’re out of your depth.  That says far more about you than it does about me.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, the reason I feel belittled is due to your belitting comments. I thought that would of been obvious. The fact you can type shit like that says far more about you than it does about me.</p>
<p>Also, if it’s not your intention of coming across as arrogant, you can still fail at your intended intentions, regardless of specificity.</p>
<p>Also again. Just because I take the view that nothing is ever certain, as it clearly isn’t, doesn’t mean I have to live my life bound to that idea, I just accept the possibility. You immidiately assume because I believe this I must be an anti-progressive neanderthal, which is just pathetic, and yet another nod towards your generalising mentality.</p>
<p>The rules of relativity themselves seemingly break down when interacting with black holes. Black holes themselves evaporate over time, leaving the matter they accumulate where? Dark matter, believed to be 3 or 4/5ths of all matter in the universe is beyond our understanding. Read up about the Quantum Zeno effect. Etc. Etc.</p>
<p>Yet your trying to tell me that we know so much about the universe? That everything we find from now on is certain based on theories coming up to a hundred years old? Read up on science history and I’m sure you’l find many times where our commonly accepted scientific knowledge becomes ever more complex and layered, or downright destroyed with a new discovery centuries down the road.</p>
<p>I’m extremely bored now, so please, no more.</p>

<p>There is a big difference between not intending for something to happen and intending for something to not happen.

</aside>
<p>Again, experience means I can say that.  I’m happy to disagree on what’s more primitive.  I don’t have a God complex and I don’t class myself as a superior being.  That’s ludacris.  I am, however, well aware when my knowledge on something is superior (same goes for when it’s inferior) to someone else’s.  You’re just trying to throw insults and have completely gone off the topic of conversation.  I admit I can be arrogant, but that doesn’t make anything I have to say less correct or relevant.  If it upsets you that I’m confident in what I know, I really don’t care; that’s your problem.</p>

<p>Jeez, don’t be so agressive… This is getting ridiculous. Also, i kind of agree with the opinion that the “nothing is ever certain and that’s all” philosophy doesn’t lead anywhere. Because let’s face it, it’s true in theory but it implies we should just call it quits and do nothing: “oh this looks too complex, i give up before i even tried”.</p>
