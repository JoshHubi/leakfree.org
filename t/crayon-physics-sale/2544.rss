    <description>There&#39;s a &quot;Pay what you want&quot; sale over at the Crayon Physics web site. It&#39;s normally $20 bucks via steam or the website (paypal, non-steam). You can get it pay whatever you want for it via the paypal route until January 15. The game&#39;s supposed to be really good, and what&#39;ve you got to lose for a cent (if you want to be a dick about it)
