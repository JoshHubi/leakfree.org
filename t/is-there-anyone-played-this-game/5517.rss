            <p>I really can’t ram on Browser-Based MMOS too much because… well… my username is based on one.<br>
Although I can’t believe that people still play Runescape. I played it for about ten minutes and stopped playing. I actually created multiple accounts because my gaps in between playings were so long I forgot my username and password. Also, one of the teachers at my school when I was nine was a bit offended by the fact that they were willing to show Christianity so much in a “Kid’s Game”. I loled.</p>

            <p>Planetside was a great FTP MMO. But Runescape is probably the worst MMO I have ever seen. And to think some people buy accounts for over 200 $ in it.</p>

            <p>A long time ago I tried to play Runescape. First something happened, then I burned some fish, and then I couldn’t figure out what to do next so I quit.</p>
<p>Also free-to-play MMOs don’t always suck. Perfect World was pretty fun (until they started adding stupid crap like genies), though eventually you find out that “free-to-play” also mean “pay-to-win”</p>
