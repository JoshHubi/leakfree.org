    <title>Thief 2 multiplayer mod doesn&#39;t work</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/thief-2-multiplayer-mod-doesnt-work/8519</link>
    <description>Probably going to be hard to find an answer, but I tried the Thief 2 MP mod found [url=&#39;https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=124169&amp;page=29&#39;]here[/url] which fixes up the unfinished multiplayer but I can&#39;t connect to my friend/vice versa.

I have a feeling it might be something to do with not having the correct port, even with hamachi when we try to join each other it just says connection timed out, even though other people seem to have it working fine over hamachi. Any ideas?</description>
