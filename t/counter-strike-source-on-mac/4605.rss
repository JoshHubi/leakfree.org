            <p>I played it for 2 minutes yesterday and was once again reminded how shit it is.</p>
<p>Rush in, spray around a bit, get 3 headshots, die, spend the rest of the 10 minutes watching a bunch of people crouching in a corner.</p>
<p>I don’t like games where 90% of the time you’re waiting… Either for the other player to make a move, or because you’re dead and are watching other players waiting for other players to make a move.</p>

            <p>Hm. I hadn’t noticed the mouse difference playing in the beta. At any rate, I hope it can be fixed soon, especially if it’s a generic Source thing.</p>
<p>So far, all I can think of for games still on the Ep1 engine are commercial games from before the OB (The Ship, Vampire, Dark Messiah), Lost Coast, and HL2DM.</p>

            <p>the game didn’t suck before the update. it does now<br>
FIX THE DAMN MOUSE LAG!</p>
<p>this is a game that requires you to instantly turn 180 degrees and accurately point to the neck of the enemy in under 0.1 seconds so you can’t have shit like mouse smoothing and motion blur turned no. ruins the game.</p>
<p>But then again Bad Company 2 is more fun and diverse than this generic ct vs t game anyways. And I can get a lot of kills in that game because there is more about tactics and team work.</p>
<p>Just saying that I’m not going to be playing this game any more just because of this update. I’ll play it now and again when I feel like it and I’m mostly going to play surf maps or any of the other custom maps as the standard de_dust, de_dust2 rotation sucks.</p>

            <p>also the mouse sensitivity is just like in TF2 and there is motion blur.<br>
So feels like I’m really playing TF2 just with CS skins and maps.</p>
<p>This sucks.</p>
<p>Oh and I’m not any better at the game since last time I played it. So I guess I’m not going to be playing this much after the update either. Regardless of server I join I’m always down with a kill death ratio of about 0.5 or less. No matter how much I play I never improve my aim at all. I even saw a tutorial on how to practice your aim once, but that didn’t stick. As soon as I see an enemy I just shoot in the general direction of him. I don’t have time to land that perfect headshot and if I did the other player is a noob (by letting me take my time) so I might as well find a new server with better players.</p>

            <p>It really sucks.  All the servers are limited to 66 tick, as opposed to the good old 100 tick…  That and the kill messages are a bit too large.</p>
