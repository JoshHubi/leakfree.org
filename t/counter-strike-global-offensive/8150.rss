    <description>I&#39;m not too sure you guys are all that into Counter Strike, but I assumed it would be nice to have a thread about it, seeing how the beta has just went public/private. I haven&#39;t received my key yet, and I&#39;m not sure if I will any time soon. Has anyone here gotten their key yet, and if so what kind of experiences are you having? 

Oh yeah, and if you do have a key it would be really appreciated if you added me, or anyone else who requests one on this thread.</description>

            <p>Hey, well. Talking about Counter Strike, I played a map like 10 years ago, in a cybercafe and I could never find it again. It was a classic map I guess, and maybe you know something about it. I remember making a post about that in cstrikeplanet, but nobody answered, that forum sucks. So, I’ll copy and paste the post here:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I’m looking for a classic map, I played it 10 years ago. First of all, it was a night time map. The map, it’s an office building I think, or something like that. It has a basement, I remember the stairs to there were blocked with a wrecked vending machine, it was dark. I remember also the sound of sparks in that zone, and that it used the floor textures that are like black and white squares, the one used in cs_backalley. The theme of the map was something like a news broadcast station being attacked by a terrorist team. I remember that CTs spawned outside the building and Ts inside(so it must have been a cs_ map, but I don’t discard it as being de_) and had to walk to the building across a kind of courtyard with some hedges I guess. The skybox was city ambiented.</p>
<p>Obviously this was 10 years ago so I don’t remember it very well, maybe there are mistakes in the description. But I think it’s enough info to figure out the name, by that time there were just a few maps. I played it in a cyber-cafe so I don’t have information about the download site or so.</p>
<p>If you know a map like this, tell me, even if you’re not sure, I’ll appreciate it. Thanks.</p>

<p>CS is epic. Don’t you remember those mornings in the cybercafe where you could hear that stupid song played near the Ts spawn point in de_italy? Or the eagle in survivor, when you cross the bridge that breaks in the edge of a cliff? The sound of the turned on engine in the little town that is covered by snow, the ice sheets in the frozen river, the chicken in Italy, even there’s a piece of shit in the toilet in cs_siege! C’mon, that’s a kickass game, I could play it for decades, and certainly I will.</p>

            <p>I hate those kinds of “free-to-play” Asian games. “Free-to-play” always means “pay-to-win”, at least to them. I used to like the MMO Perfect World until they screwed up the gameplay and put even more focus on the cash shop. Couldn’t stand it. I don’t know how people can throw so much money at those kinds of games. I knew people who must have spent hundreds of dollars to get the stuff they had, and are probably still doing it. Just unbelievable.</p>

<p>Yup, those kind of games<br>
But the most popular around here is Point Blank Online (try searching it, also Korean) That game is a shitty “free” ripoff of CS with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terrible in-game store for buying weapons, some can be purchased by in game currency (which have a use limit of 99 uses which decreases for every match you use it) and using “credits” which are purchased by real money (the items they sell doesn’t even make sense like: Golden AK-47, character models, perks that completely unbalance the game, and worse of all: Some of them still have a use limit! D <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
<li>Generally unbalanced gameplay (weapons, maps)</li>
<li>Barely anyone plays as a team, even on clan/objective matches</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes it’s like 100% if not more worse than any CoD game</p>
<p>Damn I sometimes question why I live with these people…</p>

            <p>It’s not the same with 1.6. There is a lot of people playing there since the requirements are a way lower. You’ll see a lot of people from third world countries. The problem is that they don’t usually play on-line, because they’ve got pirate versions of the game(because they’re cheaper or there are no stores in their cities), or because they don’t even know how to play online, because they’re in a cybercafe. It’s like… There aren’t real gamers, just people who play but doesn’t know a shit about the game.</p>
<p>The conclusion I’ve made: If you want to play CS, you need to have somebody to play with.</p>

<p>Ok. Throughout the timeline of CSS (I’m not sure about 1.6) there have been many different clans and communities, some rose, most fell. After CSS had it’s big update, changing the majority of it’s game play, many people left the competitive side of the game.</p>
<p>Now, if we’re talking strictly public gaming, there are a few ups and downs to this change. Let’s start with the good. A majority of the younger players left, some of the veterans stayed, and overall the maturity rose exponentially. Here’s why this is bad… those newbies, younger players and new comers all had ideas (with theirs, or their parents visa cards) to start up communities to suit their play style and play with friends. When I was younger I was part of many different small clans, I had a lot of fun, and I went from a terrible player to someone who knew how to play. Two years ago if you searched for CSS servers publicly, you would be swamped with options and choices, with a wide range of skill.</p>
<p>If you want to play CSS right now, you will see maybe tops 20 American servers(and this is just people playing, there are A LOT of empty servers, and I mean a shit ton) with people ranging 16 to mid 30’s. No kids an trolling and yelling the N word. However… The owners of these servers are the only major players, with the same people, and the same consistent skill level. Newbies won’t play the game, because they can’t compete. You can’t start up your own clan, buy a server, and get it populated/recognized.</p>
<p>TL;DR CSS is stuck with the same players, same owners, and same skill level, with almost no possibility of starting a clan of your own.</p>

            <p>The TrP pubs are great to play on, a lot better than servers like eGo and HG imo.</p>
<p>Not always too full (big games suck), and there are some unreal players on the servers, I consider myself good, but people who normally have a 4:1 KD are there pretty often, and they’re not hackers. Dust2 24/7 by the way, only way to go.</p>

<p>Joining a fun and friendly clan with a few servers usually helps you improve. But cs and css clans are really monopolized right now. Bugs the hell out of me. I miss being a part of the underdogs and working my way to the top. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>CS is epic. Don’t you remember those mornings in the cybercafe where you could hear that stupid song played near the Ts spawn point in de_italy? Or the eagle in survivor, when you cross the bridge that breaks in the edge of a cliff? The sound of the turned on engine in the little town that is covered by snow, the ice sheets in the frozen river, the chicken in Italy, even there’s a piece of shit in the toilet in cs_siege! C’mon, that’s a kickass game, I could play it for decades, and certainly I will.</p>
