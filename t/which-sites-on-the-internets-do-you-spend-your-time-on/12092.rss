        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I usually have youtube up playing music in the background.</p>
<p>When I come into work, I usually catch up on my Facebook newsfeed, then read whatever looks interesting on Cracked.  While I’m eating lunch (or after lunch, if I go out for it), I have a rotation: notalwaysright, lamebook, failbook, fmylife (I don’t even like fmylife that much; it’s just part of the rotation), iwastesomuchtime, the Chive.  Once every week or two, I also read xkcd, penny arcade, fanboys, vgcats, cyanide &amp; happiness, and the oatmeal - and I’ve made a habit of checking hyperbole &amp; a half, even though she never updates anymore.  I come here every day or two, visit another forum pretty much every day, and occasionally read rt.</p>
<p>This is all at work.  If I’m lucky, I can stave off doing any actual work for most of the day.</p>
<p>At home, I spend a lot of time on 4chan, because it’s not work safe.</p>
