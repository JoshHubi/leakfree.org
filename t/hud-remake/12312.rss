    <title>HUD remake</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hud-remake/12312</link>
    <description>Guys, I would like some help with designing a custom HUD. Specifically, I was thinking of making one with the following changes:

* Making the Hit point/armor point tracking meters look like those in [i]Half-Life 1[/i].
* Making the weapon select menu look like that in [i]Half-Life 1[/i] (the [i]Black Mesa: Source[/i]-style weapon select icons would be kept, but above each slot, the appropriate number would be listed, like in [i]Half-Life 1[/i])
* Making the ammunition tracking readout more faithful to the 1 in [i]Half-Life 1[/i] (the MP5&#39;s grenade tracker is above its bullet tracker, the reserve pool trackers are the same height/digit width as the magazine trackers, there is a divider bar separating the magazine/reserve meters rather than a percentage meter doing so, the Rocket Launcher would have separate magazine/reserve tracking meters. The ammunition icons would be kept)
* The HUD hints would be moved to the left of the screen
* The ammunition/hit point/suit fuel pickup icons would be altered so that, rather than replicating if consecutive instances of the same pickup are grabbed in quick succession, there would be 1 of that icon, with numbers indicating (in order) how many of that pickup were grabbed in rapid succession, how many of what that pickup restocks were refilled overall, how many of what that pickup restocks were refilled by that instance, &amp; how many of that what that pickup restocks that you now have (the latter is useful for ammo pickups, so you don&#39;t have to switch to the weapon in question to know how many of its ammunition you now have thanks to that pickup. For instance, if you grabbed 5 Depleted Uranium cases in quick succession, the pickup icon would be accompanied by numbers indicating: 5 Depleted Uranium cases, 81-100 Depleted Uranium Units refilled over all, 20 Depleted Uranium Units refilled per pickup, &amp; you now having 100 Depleted Uranium Units. Hit point/armor fuel pickups would lose the last number, due to having a static meter)
* Adding a &quot;sprint on&quot; indicator graphic

Also, I&#39;m putting this in &quot;the test chamber&quot; forum because I have no idea where to put threads relating to custom Heads-Up Displays.</description>

            <p>I really wish I could do something similar but I own Photoshop Elements which doesn’t have alpha channels.</p>

<p>HUD was changed remade so many times before official release, and you really want to still change it?</p>

<p>I think the current 1 is fine, I’m just trying to make 1 that’s more faithful to the HUD in the original <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 1</span>, because I happen to think it would look cooler that way. These screenshots should give you an idea of what I want to change:<br>

as opposed to<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
The customizations I’m looking to make focus on the ammunition trackers, the hit point meter, &amp; the armor fuel meter.</p>
