    <title>Cancel button when d/l maps</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cancel-button-when-d-l-maps/14197</link>
    <description>When connecting to a server and say you find out that the server host has set a 52 mb map
without a fastdownload file server, you would need to be able to quit/cancel. Rather than alt/tab/del out.

Thanks</description>
