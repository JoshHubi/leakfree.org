    <description>Well, the mod&#39;s release is heading towards us at breakneck speed, and that probably means our time together is coming to a close. But you guys mean a lot to me. Unlike most people I actually know, you guys add hiliarity and quotablility to everyday conversations. Also unlike people I actually know, I can take your words and paste them into my quote collection. Here are some goodies from my (Short, compared to most of you) stay here at the BM Forums. Post yours here.

I&#39;m not sure which is more impressive. The fact that he can do all of that, or the fact that he can do all of that in a 5 second time period. -DinoTrasher

&quot;What the hell Barney?&quot; I thought. &quot;How is this like &#39;old times&#39; ? I went to work every day pressing buttons and pushing carts while you fixed lifts, blew up computers and generally guarded stuff uneventfully! How does killing semi-human warriors of an alien empire relate to that in any way?&quot; -Baconeggs

I think that the G-man is more along the lines of an alien salesman. In HL he is interested in real-estate, more specifically Xen.- Sitten Duck

What&#39;s next, having to file taxes and do jury duty in The Sims? Having to buy and read the real gun maintenance manuals, go to the in-game store and buy the cleaning tools and then manually clean the guns in Far Cry 3?
Keep the annoying realism out of games. -hampsteralliance

[quote]
Take this only a step further and it becomes &quot;Aahhh! this alien creature appears to have captured my lower calf in a irresistibly powerful grip of which I cannot break free, thus leading me to hypothesize that it shall use that grip to drag me from my location of safety in order to inflict irrevocable bodily harm and ultimately result in my untimely demise! Ahhhhh! My hypothesis was correeeect!&quot; - Grey Acumen

Our guns, which art in our hands, boom sticks be thy name, to Kingdom come, you will be done, as here on Earth or on Xen. 
Give us this day our daily lead, and forgive not those who shoot us, as we shoot them back (with glee). Yay, though I walk through the the valley of the shadow of n00bs, I shall fear no overhead rocket launches. In the name of the gun, the fodder, and the holy whiskey, amen.  - The Reverend&#39;s Signature

Let me hazard a guess. They removed the stomp attack completely? 
OR! Maybe they removed the garg entirely! There&#39;s just a post-it note near where he would have appeared that reads:

I think you just mean &quot;former co-workers&quot;.
Unless being eaten by zombies somehow makes them co-workers again.  :stuck_out_tongue:  -HomadeMuffins

&quot;I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll be deviating a bit from standard releasing procedures today, Gordon.&quot;
&quot;Yes, but with good reason, this is a rare opportunity for us, this is the most awesome mod we&#39;ve seen yet.&quot;
&quot;And potentially the most unstable.&quot;
&quot;Now, now if we follow standard modding procedures, everything will be fine.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t know how you can say that. Although I will admit the possibility of a mass disappointment scenario is extremely unlikely.&quot;
&quot;The fans don&#39;t need to hear all this, they are mostly patient individuals. We&#39;ve assured the community that nothing will go wrong.&quot;
&quot;Ah yes, you&#39;re right. Black Mesa, we have complete confidence in you.&quot; -Master_G

            <p>Hey look, a memorable forum quote! ^</p>
<p>I don’t remember many from the golden days… one that jumps to mind is, “The hivehand will be replaced by a leather sports bag that shoots out foul language and twisted innuendo.”</p>
<p>Also, there was something about headcrabs only being vulnerable to feather dusters.</p>

            <p>Well, the mod’s release is heading towards us at breakneck speed, and that probably means our time together is coming to a close. But you guys mean a lot to me. Unlike most people I actually know, you guys add hiliarity and quotablility to everyday conversations. Also unlike people I actually know, I can take your words and paste them into my quote collection. Here are some goodies from my (Short, compared to most of you) stay here at the BM Forums. Post yours here.</p>

<p>I’m not sure which is more impressive. The fact that he can do all of that, or the fact that he can do all of that in a 5 second time period. -DinoTrasher</p>
