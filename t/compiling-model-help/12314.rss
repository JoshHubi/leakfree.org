    <title>Compiling Model help!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/compiling-model-help/12314</link>
    <description>After compiling a model, I viewed it in model viewer. It is too far from the center. Please give some tips. Thank you! 

EDIT: It also faces to the left instead of facing you but in physics tab, the model is in the center and facing you. I&#39;m just a beginner in this.</description>
