    <title>Alan Wake on PC and American Nightmare</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/alan-wake-on-pc-and-american-nightmare/8504</link>
    <description>I guess E3 2005&#39;s promises of Alan Wake on PC were finally fulfilled this week. Not only that, but the appropriately priced (and probably only timed exclusive) sort of sequel-sort of expansion Alan Wake&#39;s American Nightmare came out on XBLA as well. Too bad this new one falls even more into the trap the later parts of the first did. Too little suspense, too much power. I&#39;m still gonna buy it, Remedy is under appreciated, and perhaps one day if they get enough money they can make a Max Payne 4! (Not that I don&#39;t think Rockstar can make good games, its just that I&#39;m worried it won&#39;t be &#39;Max Payne&#39;)</description>

<p>No need to be such an asshole. Of course they won’t make a fourth, Rockstar owns it now and yes it would have been better off left at 2. I meant that more as a pipe dream that they could one day buy back the rights, not necessarily make a fourth.</p>

            <p>I’ve already bought it. Beat it in 11 hours. Great graphics, great sound, great atmosphere and especially great story. Yeah, the gameplay gets repititive after a while (although in American Nightmare it’s supposed to be pretty fun to fight the creatures as there are more variety in enemies and weapons). I can recommend it. But I miss, that it’s not open world, although it was possible. Still, a great game and yes, Remedy is underrated.</p>
<p>The two DLCs are okay, but they can’t keep up with the original, but they are free so it’s okay.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for Alan Wake 2. I hope the PC versions sells good.</p>
