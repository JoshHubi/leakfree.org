    <title>Very Long Loading Times</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/very-long-loading-times/14417</link>
    <description>Hello, I have been finding that the only issue I have with the game is the loading times. For me they will range between 45secs-1min and they noticeably get longer at the portal to xen in the Black Mesa complex. This is the only Source engine game I have had loading times worthy of being called obnoxious, even the load times of Black Mesa 2012 were super fast in comparison like 5-10sec. My computer specs are


Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 765M
RAM: 16GB
Hardrive model: WD7500BPKX-80HPJ0 
Hardrive RPM: 7200 RPM


Please help me resolve this issue as I foresee myself playing this game many many more times.</description>

            <p>To me at least, the mod release and the earlier versions of the steam release had much longer load times than the steam release has now so i guess make sure its up to date.</p>
