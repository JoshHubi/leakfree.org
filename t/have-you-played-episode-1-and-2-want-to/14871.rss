            <p>ah, lol, well if you have any peers that haven’t played them, send them this way. hl2, being a requirement though of course.</p>
<p>bumping, if anyone has any peers that have not played the episodic content for hl2 and would like to.  send them here! I have episode 1 and 2 for whoever wants them, that hasn’t played them.</p>
