    <title>Crash on Zombie Grunt Corpse Gibbing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-on-zombie-grunt-corpse-gibbing/15000</link>
    <description>I have yet to get around to testing this on my desktop, so this report is (at the moment) going to be limited to my laptop, running Windows 8.1.

Gibbing a zombie grunt with a shotgun works fine, as does the gluon and explosives - however, once the zombie grunt is [b]dead[/b], if the ragdoll has any contact with explosives or the tau cannon, it will crash the game. (Oddly the gluon gun - and sometimes the tau cannon - seems to fire [i]through[/i] the corpse, rather than making contact with it)

Additionally, I don&#39;t [i]think [/i]this one has been reported or fixed yet - on the (very!) rare occasions when explosions halve zombie guards, it spawns a zombie scientist torso npc rather than a zombie guard torso. I have yet to encounter the halving behavior on the zombie grunt, so I don&#39;t know if this is the case for them.</description>

            <p>I’m fairly certain this bug was fixed quite some time ago, but it seems to have had a resurgence.</p>
<p>EDIT: Despite crashing the game consistently a few times, it seems to have fixed itself again. Strange.</p>

            <p>Halving also works properly on Win 10, and there was more stability with live zombie grunts this round of testing - It wasn’t until I used an mp5 grenade on a dead zombie (killed with 357, doubt that makes a difference though) that the game crashed.</p>
<p>This bug is weird and I don’t know why it only seems to affect some operating systems/machines.</p>

            <p>Just loaded bm_c2a5g to do explosives tests on the zombie grunts in the parking lot - I used every explosive available to me on map load, and I used shotgun to gib zombies, and there were no crashes. I even tried to do some corpse explosions and Tau Cannon but it does not crash. I also have halved a zombie guard, and it spawned, for me at least, a zombie guard torso npc. I tried to reproduce JeffMOD’s glitch, but couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>However, I did manage to crash my game messing around. I placed tripmines far away from a dead Alien Grunt ragdoll (presumably, i never figured out), and placed satchel charges near said ragdoll. I detonated the ragdoll, and my game crashed.</p>
<p>I’m using windows 7.</p>

            <p>Crash also confirmed on Windows 10 - using explosives to gib a live zombie this time. The crash seems to occur right on the frame at/before detonation (the game hangs there for a second before crashing), so I would assume it has something to do with the gibbing check.</p>

<p>It definitely halves the zombie grunt to make a zombie <span class="bbcode-u">grunt</span> npc.<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">One other thing to add is that, alongside spawning a zombie scientist torso npc, it has no AI and just sits there while I mercilessly beat it to death.</span><br>
EDIT: nevermind, seemed to be a one-off thing</p>
