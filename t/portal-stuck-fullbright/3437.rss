    <title>Portal stuck fullbright!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portal-stuck-fullbright/3437</link>
    <description>I was playing a Portal map I downloaded, and I crashed it somehow.  Now all my portal maps are fullbright.  Anybody experienced this before?

By all, I mean stock game maps and all.

UPDATE: Well that&#39;s wierd.  After a day and a half of trying to fix this problem, I finally decide to post a question up here for help, and then I go and relaunch Portal (which I closed just before posting, things still fullbright), and now it&#39;s all better.

Thanks Black Mesa Forums.  You are the best!

Can I has lock/delete?</description>
