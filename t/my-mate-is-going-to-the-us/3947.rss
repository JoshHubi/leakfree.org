    <title>My mate is going to the us :(</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-mate-is-going-to-the-us/3947</link>
    <description>One of my best friends is going to the us - to be precise texas, some  place near houston called san antonio. So i am feeling down because of this - in fact it almost made me cry :&#39;(
The only reason for this is his wish to graduate- to complete the last year of high school -we have 8 grades in elementary school and 4 in &quot;middle&quot; school he completed the first 3 and the 4th one he wants to do in america.And he is 17 yo.

I as a non-american person have no idea what&#39;s it like there i&#39;m actually thinking of going there myself.Is it really chuck-norrisy or what

This is not a troll!!!Really !!!!
TV made me ask these questions 
Are americans bad people (america bombed us in 1999)?
Are all americans fat and stupid like they say?
How bangable are chicks in houston?
Do all americans go to las vegas and waste money?
Are spanish people going to conquer america any time soon?
You know in general what&#39;s it like in houston are there many murders rapes etc?
Is america going out of economic crysis?
WTF IS LIKE IN AMERICA
ANSWER IF YOU LIVE THERE</description>

One of the last days they were here, their rental car got rear-ended by someone talking on the phone and not paying attention. Not the best lasting impression. :pffft:</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ll admit Texas drivers aren’t all great, but its not terrible. I’ve been driving for about two or three years and never had one accident, unless you count the time I ran into some dumb kid on a pimped-out bike riding the wrong way on the street while I was turning right around a corner with a huge ass hedge of trees. I hear LA has the worst drivers though.</p>

Its true that Texas came out as a red state, but it was a much narrower margin than you think. Texas has a VERY diverse population, and its just one more thing that proves you should not listen to stereotypes.</p>
<p>And I would hardly describe conservatives as “extremists” unless they are trying violently take over the government.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hmm… perhaps I was wrong for taking stereotypes for granted. I guess I would have to spend more time down south than I have. Anyway, I meant conservative extremists as in the extreme end of conservatives, not as in terrorists or something like that. All groups have extremists, you don’t have to be violent to be an extremists you simply need to hold an extreme opinion among your political/religious group. Like I would probably be considered and atheist extremist.</p>

[COLOR=‘red’]Not true, there are lots of countries that we dislike and we haven’t gone to war with… yet. Fact is we were attacked, we responded with force. Insurgents and money was flowing from Iraq, and whether or not you believe that Our president was lying when he said they had intelligence to suggest that there were weapons of mass destruction, they had what they thought was credible intel. We responded to what we thought was a credible threat, and it was with or without WMDs. Our Congress was united on the issue for the most part (before support fell apart to be used as a political tool), and other countries in the UN agreed with us. Bottom line, I am not going to exert myself trying to justify something if you don’t believe it, there’s no point, but just because you would like to believe something doesn’t make it true.</li>
<li>manipulating media to convince folks to do whatever the gov. wants<br>
[COLOR=‘red’]Right… Because In the US we don’t have free press or free speech, or even minds of our own to prevent the government from controlling us through the media.</li>
<li>healthcare issues<br>
[COLOR=‘red’]Very much an artificially overblown issue, but I agree our system isn’t perfect and could do with reform. But by no means a terrible system, we still have access to any health care options we need, and don’t have a waiting list to go get a surgery, X-ray, MRI’s or CAT scans. Ooh, and here in Texas we have a lot of new treatment options that aren’t available anywhere else in the world yet.</li>

<p>Fun fact: Texas isn’t a barren wasteland like it is on tv until you get out closer to El Paso. It does get hot in Texas, but everything Is air conditioned.</p>
<p>Second Fun Fact: All the major cities in Texas in the last presidential election except for one voted for President Obama.<br>
Its true that Texas came out as a red state, but it was a much narrower margin than you think. Texas has a VERY diverse population, and its just one more thing that proves you should not listen to stereotypes.</p>
<p>And I would hardly describe conservatives as “extremists” unless they are trying violently take over the government.</p>

How bangable are chicks in houston?<br>
Do all americans go to las vegas and waste money?<br>

            <p>I know I’m a little late in this thread and this might have already been mentioned, but Texas is probably the last place in America I would want to live besides Alaska. It’s hot and barren, and is one of the most conservative states. And as a rule, 90% of extremist conservatives are assholes. But they should be nice as long as you don’t bring politics into the mix.</p>

            <p>Removing the tidbits that I could troll on or just make some bad statement on… I live in the Eastern United States. Virginia to be specific just outside of DC and I’ve been to redneck states before, NC &amp; Tennessee. I’ve never been to Texas myself, but that’ll change late in the summer season though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are americans bad people (america bombed us in 1999)?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not all of us are bad people, some are sophisticated, and think differently than other people do.</p>
<p>The case with me; I think most people are stupid (Not just my fellow Americans, just about every one). Though I do gauge people for their actions, not word, or vocabulary.</p>
<p>The reason I think as such is because I have a very high IQ, and I can think on my feet very quickly.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Are all americans fat and stupid like they say?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If stupid you mean socially inept: No.<br>
If stupid you mean don’t think: Some not all.<br>
If stupid you mean Neo Nazism AND KKK &amp; related moronic organizations: Minority.</p>
<p>It all depends on the view of the person. Don’t take the Media’s points at face value. Take a look at the people who live in the United States, you’ll see a variety of people &amp; cultures in the states.</p>
<p>And no, we’re not all fat. It’s a dumbass stereo type that doesn’t do the people who live here good. Some are, some aren’t. That being said, just do some research. I’m quite attractive in my own right, as I’m sure every one is.</p>
<p>One of the masonic lodges that sponsors my DeMolay Chapter has a Brit as their worshipful master, the guy’s a dick, as is the next one who’s coming in (who I don’t think is a Brit, but I could be wrong). But I don’t take his personality and stance as what all Brits’ are. I know a few Aussies, Canadians, and Brits myself and they’re awesome people.</p>
<p>That being said; don’t take what the media or what other people say about this nation at face value. Do your own research and look into it yourself then compare it to what people say about it. They are drastically different.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>How bangable are chicks in houston?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There’s plenty of hot chicks in the Southern states, you jus’ have to know where to look.</p>
<p>My girlfriend/Would-be wife lives in TX now (which sucks) she use to live here. I managed to keep the relationship between her and I alive through hard effort. I won’t go any further than that, but yes there’s A LOT of hot chicks, you just have to look.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Do all americans go to las vegas and waste money?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Those who like to gamble. Not ALL of us like to. I don’t mind playing Poker every now and then when I have some money to burn.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Are spanish people going to conquer america any time soon?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No. The Illegal Immigrant problem is just an over bloated figure. I doubt there’s as many people as the USMedia says there is crossing. With out getting checked, etc.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>You know in general what’s it like in houston are there many murders rapes etc?</p>

<p>When in doubt use google.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  But in all seriousness, likely no more than any other metropolis, just avoid the bad areas, and if you HAVE to go there, keep your guard up.</p>

<p>It’s stabilizing for now, it’s a matter of time.</p>
