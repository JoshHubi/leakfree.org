    <title>hl2.exe does ABSOLUTELY nothing. just says preparing to lauch black mesa and nothing.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-exe-does-absolutely-nothing-just-says-preparing-to-lauch-black-mesa-and-nothing/10718</link>
    <description>ok so yeah, hi.

so here is my problem.

i downloaded and installed bms. directory wise everything is in order. deleted every source related games and tools at the beginning of summer so i installed them via steam again. 

then i restarted steam and voila. black mesa was in the list. i clicked it and nothing happened. ABSOLUTELY nothing.

tried 15 different ways to solve the problem. but i was the only one in the whole wide web to have this error. cuz there is no error. it just says &quot;preparing to launch black mesa&quot; and then nothing. nothing launches.
i tried launching sdk. because everybody said there is this test page and all. and it didnt work either. hl2.exe seems to do nothing. so i thought about deleting and downloading sdk again but then again we have a quota for the internet usage each month, and sizewise the sdk is too damn big space occupying. 

i need only a working hl2.exe and steam doesnt download just that. it downloads gbs. and yeah.... quota.

so help. please.</description>

<p>Stupid question, but I will do it anyway: did you install the Source SDK 2007 on your steam?</p>
<p>Because this is a common problem when the sdk is not installed. <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=13341" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">More info</a>.</p>
<p>If yes, I guess your BM installation files may be corrupted.</p>

</aside>
<p>dude of course i did.i mean i literally tried everything in my power.</p>
<p>and sdk 2007 is the problem itself i think.</p>
<p>because the application wont launch. at all. and that makes bms unavailable for me.</p>
<p>so i guess only 2 other guys have the same problem as me. and they havent found a solution either. might be something abut w7 x64 systems but i m not exactly sure. and also i tried everything with the launch options, i mean i tried every command. still not working.</p>

<p>please do the following:</p>
<pre><code>    Right-click on the game (being Half Life 2 and Source 2007 SDK) and select "Properties"
    Click on the "Local Files" tab
    Click on the "Verify Integrity of Game Cache" button.

<p>Please let me know what the results are.</p>

</aside>
<p>still nothing. everything checked after the verification. so just out of curiosity i downloaded hl: deathmatch to see if my suspicions were right about hl2.exe.</p>
<p>turns out it wasn’t. it worked.<br>
but bm is not working. and still no error codes or anything. it doesnt even work in the background.</p>
<p>same goes for the sdk.</p>
