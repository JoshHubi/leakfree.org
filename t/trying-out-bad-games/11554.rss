    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/trying-out-bad-games/11554</link>
    <description>Have you ever wanted to try a game that everybody said it was bad, simply out sheer curiosity?
For example, I&#39;ve always wanted to play Metroid: Other M, solely to get a grip on the gameplay and see if it excuses the story (I watched the story on youtube, jesus pissing christ, it is BAD).</description>

<p>The only people who call it anything like “horrible” are the pretentious fucktards who were only in the series for it’s comically hamfisted noire execution. Don’t get me wrong, I loved that too, but it’s not what makes Max payne what it is. What makes Max Payne what it is, is how it handles. I’d say it’s one of the tightest third person shooters this generation, rivaling Gears of war in terms of player control. This is a fucking shooter. This is the most important factor above AI (which is above level design), and this is what it got right. I’d say it nailed all 3 factors. As linear as it was, it was a fucking great line.</p>

<p>Don’t make me post my 3500 word review, Xal. You’ll have a word seizure =P</p>
<p>As for the story, well, I’ll put it this way: There are far more pressing reasons I have for hating the game.</p>

<p>Ranting about what other people think about stuff and how they are idiots or assholes for not agreeing with your personal views is kind of your thing, isn’t it?</p>

<p>What?.. It’s best in the series IMO, the only flaw is a lack of throwable explosives.</p>

            <p>And to think I was ready to give DNF the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>It could be that I tend to prefer story to gameplay, but I couldn’t make it far into Just Cause 2. The writing and voice acting were terrible, and it made me sad.</p>
<p>Attaching cop cars to the street as they chased you at high speed was kinda fun, though.</p>
