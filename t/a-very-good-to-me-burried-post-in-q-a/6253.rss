    <title>A very good (to me) burried post in Q&amp;A</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-very-good-to-me-burried-post-in-q-a/6253</link>
    <description>I spent about an hour reading up on your game, and really look forward to it. But the most important question on my mind was one that was not on Conti&#39;s interesting posts, ( [url]https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/User:Conti#Levels[/url]) or the big list of links in the Level&#39;s section ([url]https://www.isblackmesareleased.com/#[/url]) but really should be. 

I watch Ross Scott&#39;s &#39;Freeman&#39;s mind&#39; episodes and really laugh how a lot of the puzzles are down right absurd far too often.

Then I found the small glimmer of clarification I was dying to learn about with that in mind, and think a lot of others will appreciate hearing about as well:

I look forward to the release, it sounds and looks great.</description>

<p>It deserves it. This point will make or break the game they are creating, and will be the most contentious topic as what they do or don’t do will be celebrated, reviled, double guessed, and all sorts of opinionated things…</p>
