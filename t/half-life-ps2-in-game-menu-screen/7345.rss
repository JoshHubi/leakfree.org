    <title>Half-Life PS2 - In-Game menu screen.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-ps2-in-game-menu-screen/7345</link>
    <description>Okay, I was going through my old video camera stuff and I saw some HL videos I recorded to do a comparison to the PC version. While watching the videos I noticed that in-game I hit pause and went to a menu screen. The only thing that strikes me is that instead of the standard orange HL PS2 menu screen, it was a dark red screen with bloody hand prints. I VAGUELY recall this, and I remember I&#39;ve only seen this one. has anybody else ever seen this or know how to trigger it?</description>
