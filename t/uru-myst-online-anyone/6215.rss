It may be dated, but it&#39;s really deep for those of you that want an MMO that thinks on a different level.

And best of all it&#39;s free.  Check it out sometime.</description>

            <p>I am an old timer there, during the time of the PROLOGUE back in 04.  When the Cyan actors would interact with us explorers.  Still praying for new funding.  Am I the only one that thinks technology is at a point where Cyan can actually make new Myst games look like the static images of old, but in true 3d?</p>

            <p>Been playing pretty much since it was re-released. It gets dull once you complete all the puzzles it currently has, but it’s still fun and free.</p>
