It&#39;s back in time for the Holiday Season. Just like the last bundle, pay any price you want for 5 excellent indie games. You can even split the money you spend between charities and the developers.

The games are:
Braid
Machinarium
Osmos
Cortex Command
Revenge of the Titan

The games are (according to the site), 100% DRM free and will run on Mac, Linux, and Windows. The pack also comes with a 2 soundtracks and one mini-album for:
Machinarium
Osmos
Revenge of the Titans

I purchased the last bundle and can vouch, this is a quality purchase. All the games worked great in the last bundle, and they recently by request got Valve to give Steam copies to everyone who purchased the first bundle. I can only assume this second bundle will be the same quality.</description>

<p>Edit: Has anyone played that Lugaru HD game? Is it just me or… it sucks badly?<br>
I just managed to kick some bunny’s ass… then I get told to ‘look for more’, and if I run too far from the “village” (just some idle bunnies, some trees, and some ugly rocks, really), I get lost and it’s impossible to find the way back.</p>

            <p>Level of text wasn’t necessary for the full understanding of meanings but they did reinforce them. The story was a good show of the mental fallout of the opener of Pandora’s box. Was fun playing thru it again knowing this and how the opening concepts mesh. Like watching a movie after again and picking up more and more things.</p>
<p>As for drawing conclusions may I recommend the The Old Man and the Sea - Jesus relation.</p>

</aside>
<p>Similar to a Legend of Zelda game, you get a number of different powers, n the form of songs that each transform you into a different form.<br>
The first one, and often the most useful, is Energy Form, allowing you to shoot up the place with homing energy shots.<br>
The second is beast form, which lets you swim through more powerful currents (using new powers to bypass certain barriers is a common thing in the game) and turns your ‘dash’ into a biting attack. If you eat something, you regenerate health.</p>
<p>You eventually work your way up to a superpowered form a bit like the Soul Cube; once you get a few kills with its normal attack, you can use its special move to destroy everything onscreen. Of course, this all happens just before the final boss.</p>
<p>There’s also a recipe-making system in the game. Once you pick up one of a resulting item (ie, strawberry pie) you learn the recipe (strawberry + pie). Stocking those up becomes very helpful with a number of the bosses, especially since many of them give effects like additional defense, speed, etc.</p>
<p>If you didn’t get to Energy Form, at least try that much and finish that dungeon. It pains me the game takes a while to get to its good parts, because I kind of wish other people would finish it.</p>

<p>For the record, my favorite game in the bundle (Braid included, as amazing as it is) is Aquaria. Massive adventure with plenty of optional areas, starts a little slow.</p>
<p>Aquaria and Machinarium had great soundtracks, often very fitting. Aquaria’s is often slow to fit with exploration and beauty, but can also tone up to a fast-paced action track for the boss fights. There was even one boss where I particularly noted his attacks were slow-paced, but very strong, and the music for that fight actually seemed to be paced just the same way.</p>

            <p>Not sure how many of you played braid to 100%, with all 8 stars + secret messages in the epilogue. Many people think braid is a deep game, like with the healing time and the final level reversal but the full story goes much further. I wont spoil anything because I was blown away when I began reading into everything but If you don’t have the time to get everything I’m sure there are vids on youtube.</p>
<p>Honestly, I haven’t read a book that was half as deep as this game in a long time.</p>

<p>I am stuck already on Braid and it has already caused my 6 yr old to cry.  stupid game.</p>

<p>I got stuck once or twice in it… a quick youtube search fixed it.</p>
<p>I was stuck at the bottom of the first pit… you know, when you have to hit a key that doesn’t even show up in the control config…</p>
<p>Machinarium disappointed me a little bit… I heard a lot of good about it. But I’ll admit I had no idea even what genre of game it was. It’s not bad, but I find it… too slow. The  time spent:reward ratio is pretty low  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
I preferred the ‘oh yay I solved that puzzle’ feeling from playing Braid than when playing Machinarium.</p>
<p>Edit: Has anyone played that Lugaru HD game? Is it just me or… it sucks badly?<br>
I just managed to kick some bunny’s ass… then I get told to ‘look for more’, and if I run too far from the “village” (just some idle bunnies, some trees, and some ugly rocks, really), I get lost and it’s impossible to find the way back.</p>

            <p>Got mine the other day - already had Braid (awesome game, Catz!), but I’m really looking forward to Machinarium.</p>

<p>Yeah me too. Just added them to Steam.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I got it this morning as well… Too bad Steam does not give me giftable extra copies since I already owned Braid and Gish before I picked up the HIB2. Not that it matters really, doesn’t hurt to support the indies.</p>
