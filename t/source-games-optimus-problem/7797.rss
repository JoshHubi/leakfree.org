    <description>*Sry I posted this in the wrong section :FFFUUU: pls move it*

Hi all,

it&#39;s my first post here, but first of all I wanna congrat with the devs for their good job on the mod, can&#39;t wait to play it  :slight_smile: 

Btw, I&#39;m writing because of a problem related to Nvidia Optimus that affects Source games. However, I don&#39;t know if I own it, since I use the native ASUS hybrid power solution Power 4 Gear.

Almost every game I play starts with the Nvidia GT 540M adapter instead of Intel HD 3000 card. If not, I manually add the .exe file from the game directory in the Nvidia control panel. It seems however that Source games start with the Nvidia graphic (right-clicking in &quot;run with graphic processor&quot; shows Nvidia as default), but in-game the Intel card is used.

Typing mat_info in the console results in this:

[code]ShaderAPI: shaderapidx9.dll
Shader API Driver Info:

Driver : [COLOR=&#39;red&#39;]nvumdshim.dll Version : 2251872828923738
Driver Description :  [COLOR=&#39;red&#39;]Intel(R) HD Graphics Family
Chipset version 32902 278 368185411 9

Display mode : 1366 x 768 @60Hz (BGRX8888)
Vertex Shader Version : 3.0 Pixel Shader Version : 3.0[/code]

As you can see, the &quot;nvumdshim.dll&quot; is the Nvidia driver, but the description says Intel, which is odd.

Again:

[code]SHADERAPI CAPS:
m_NumSamplers: 16
m_NumVertexSamplers: 4
m_HasSetDeviceGammaRamp: no
[COLOR=&#39;red&#39;]m_SupportsPixelShaders_2_b: yes
m_SupportsShaderModel_3_0: no[/code]

The code reports support for Pixel Shader 2.0b, but not for Shader Model 3.0, which is more odd, since I know that the Intel HD 3000 supports the 4.1 version.

All this causes some effects to be unavailable, for example in the &quot;shadow detail&quot; box only &quot;low&quot; and &quot;medium&quot; are shown, &quot;high&quot; is not.

Actually the Nvidia graphic is used for rendering (I discovered this because playing Portal 2 with the Intel card and triple buffered v-sync is smooth, but playing it with Nvidia card and the same level of v-sync lags horribly), but the games recognize the optimal settings from the Intel graphic. At this point it looks like an hardware detection failure, but I&#39;m not sure about. It&#39;s not just a settings problem; I often experience some bugs and strange textures, which Intel cards are best known to cause. My only question is if there&#39;s a way to fully use the Nvidia adapter instead of Intel one.

I posted my problem in the Nvidia forum and Steam forum, but I didn&#39;t receive a reply, or simply my posts were ignored. I&#39;m sure that many of you are aware of how much these hybrids techs are bugged, but I would really appreciate if someone knows a good fix. Thanks in advance  :smiley:</description>

<p>It’s not only my issue, there are plenty of people complaining this and all have different laptops with the same tech. The best hope now is to wait Nvidia response.</p>

<p>Same thing, they don’t work. I asked Nvidia in a survey to fix this bug in the next driver, although I seriously doubt they will :meh:</p>

            <p>Can you disable the Intel graphics in the Bios? Also, there should be a setting in the Bios to change the startup display to the PCIE x16 board. Are you using a 2.0 Intel Core I series CPU (I3, I5 or I7)? If so, and the above don’t work, you might look at some of the other Bios settings for CPU graphics. Other than that, I can’t help you because I have first generation I7, and it doesn’t have the built in rendering module.</p>

            <p><em>Sry I posted this in the wrong section :FFFUUU: pls move it</em></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>it’s my first post here, but first of all I wanna congrat with the devs for their good job on the mod, can’t wait to play it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Btw, I’m writing because of a problem related to Nvidia Optimus that affects Source games. However, I don’t know if I own it, since I use the native ASUS hybrid power solution Power 4 Gear.</p>
<p>Almost every game I play starts with the Nvidia GT 540M adapter instead of Intel HD 3000 card. If not, I manually add the .exe file from the game directory in the Nvidia control panel. It seems however that Source games start with the Nvidia graphic (right-clicking in “run with graphic processor” shows Nvidia as default), but in-game the Intel card is used.</p>
<p>Typing mat_info in the console results in this:</p>
<p>[code]ShaderAPI: shaderapidx9.dll<br>
Shader API Driver Info:</p>
<p>Driver : [COLOR=‘red’]nvumdshim.dll Version : 2251872828923738<br>
Driver Description :  [COLOR=‘red’]Intel® HD Graphics Family<br>
Chipset version 32902 278 368185411 9</p>
<p>Display mode : 1366 x 768 <span class="mention">@60Hz</span> (BGRX8888)<br>
Vertex Shader Version : 3.0 Pixel Shader Version : 3.0[/code]</p>
<p>As you can see, the “nvumdshim.dll” is the Nvidia driver, but the description says Intel, which is odd.</p>
<p>Again:</p>
<p><code>SHADERAPI CAPS:
m_NumSamplers: 16
m_NumVertexSamplers: 4
m_HasSetDeviceGammaRamp: no
[COLOR='red']m_SupportsPixelShaders_2_b: yes
m_SupportsShaderModel_3_0: no</code></p>
<p>The code reports support for Pixel Shader 2.0b, but not for Shader Model 3.0, which is more odd, since I know that the Intel HD 3000 supports the 4.1 version.</p>
<p>All this causes some effects to be unavailable, for example in the “shadow detail” box only “low” and “medium” are shown, “high” is not.</p>
<p>Actually the Nvidia graphic is used for rendering (I discovered this because playing Portal 2 with the Intel card and triple buffered v-sync is smooth, but playing it with Nvidia card and the same level of v-sync lags horribly), but the games recognize the optimal settings from the Intel graphic. At this point it looks like an hardware detection failure, but I’m not sure about. It’s not just a settings problem; I often experience some bugs and strange textures, which Intel cards are best known to cause. My only question is if there’s a way to fully use the Nvidia adapter instead of Intel one.</p>
<p>I posted my problem in the Nvidia forum and Steam forum, but I didn’t receive a reply, or simply my posts were ignored. I’m sure that many of you are aware of how much these hybrids techs are bugged, but I would really appreciate if someone knows a good fix. Thanks in advance  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
