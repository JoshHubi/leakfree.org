    <title>Game Crashes (with details)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-with-details/12447</link>
    <description>The problem is that i am unable to get through the &quot;Inbound&quot; level (1st level) without hpl2 ( or hl2?) crashing.... the game is crashing.  I havn&#39;t been able to find an error like this on the forum.  I need someone to solve this problem :freeman:

I launch the game, hit new game, then i wait in the tram ride until the game crashes on the very 1st tram turn of every time i try to play. 
(i am also noticing that most of the scientist models have blood stains all over them)

Note: Whenever i have my character looking straight at the ground i have no problems making it through the 1st turn, in fact, i could play this game if i would keep looking down the entire time.  Whenever i look up more than 45degrees from straight down @ the ground the game crashes (past that 1st turn area).  [i think this might be some kind of evil texture]

- i have downloaded the Source sdk base 2007 in steam
- i have my BMS file in the correct path
- im pretty sure my hardware meets requirements (and passes)
- i have tried playing this game in windowed mode @ lower resolution.

Hardware:
CPU : AMD Fx-4100 3.6Ghz not over clocked (supports 5.0 shader)
GPU: ATI/AMD Radeon 6800 series  1024mb
RAM: 16gb DDr3


[u]MDMP error code of latest crash[/u]: &lt;a class=&#39;attachment&#39; href=&#39;/uploads/default/original/2X/1/179e8f760b9920c4c8e5dc56cdf536255fc12e23.mdmp&#39;&gt;hl2_3943_crash_2013_8_10T6_4_58C0.mdmp&lt;/a&gt; (96.2 KB)



P.S. 
I am also suffering another crash whenever i try to adjust my video quality settings to be lowered, might be related. (they currently defaulted to high and what not).</description>
