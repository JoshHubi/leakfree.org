    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-fried-my-computer/3808</link>
    <description>I was plugging in my cd drive to my computer and forgot to turn it off first. When I plugged the cd drive&#39;s 4-pin molex into the power supply it sparked and the computer died. The computer won&#39;t turn on anymore. The MOBO&#39;s light is still on. So how do I figure out what&#39;s fried and what isn&#39;t? :fffuuu::&#39;(</description>

            <p>Double post, but, I just got my PSU in the mail and it works great! Thanks a lot for all the help. But now I’m stuck with another problem that started before the computer fried. I can’t connect to our wifi. I think it’s a problem with our modem and the at&amp;t people are coming over this Thursday to fix it.</p>

<p>why do you need so many 4-pin Molex connectors? Rember that you don’t have to use the 2 molex to video card adapter because that power supply has a built in PCI-E powerline. If you need all 6 you may have to get a molex splitter as the one I posted only has 4.<br>

<p>I just realized my fans’ molex connectors work like christmas tree light chords and have a female and male on the end so the molexes shouldn’t be a problem. Does that PS you linked have the two six pins needed for the 9800gtx, or does the “PCI-E power line” make it so I don’t need them?</p>
<p>BTW Thanks a lot for all this help, and I apologize for my ignorance.</p>
<p>EDIT: lol, I figured it out, PCI-e is the 6-pin cable. I guess I’ll buy it right now then.</p>

            <p>Alright, I’m finally done procrastinating. I haven’t been able to get a hold of another psu to test in my computer, but I’m sick of waiting so I’m going to buy a new psu. I have no idea to tell what kind of psu to get, so I looked at all the power connections in my pc and listed them, I don’t know all the technical terms for them so I’ve just described some of the cables.</p>
<p>4-pin Molex:	6<br>
6-pin:	2 (3x2 pin cables that plug into my nVidia 9800GTX, my old psu only had one 6-pin so I used an adapter that turned two Molexs into one 6-pin)<br>
4-pin:	2 (theses go next to each other into a 2x8 pin slot in the motherbaord)<br>
a 10x2 and a 2x2 that go next to each other and plug into a big 12x2 pin slot in the motherboard</p>
<p>My old psu was 535 watt, but I was told the was a little low, so I would prefer something a little more powerful. I’d prefer something under 100 dollars.</p>

<p>But yah, that sounds like a bad PS. If your feeling adventurious open hey up and see if one of the fuses is blown.</p>

            <p>Actually I fixed my PSU the last time it died (plugged it in a 200v plug while it was set to 100v, silly regional differences  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> ) by just replacing the fuse, since it’s usually the one thing that gets fried when you plug something in a higher voltage plug.</p>
<p>But yeah, like FireTime stated, if it’s still getting some power then it most likely means it’s not the fuse, since a fried fuse will interrupt the circuit and there would be no power at all.</p>

            <p>It <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> be possible but from what your telling me I wouldn’t gamble on it. Usually when a computer power supply fuse blows it is because of electrical failure on the AC side of the transformer. It wont cost anything to take off a few screws and check tho.</p>
<p>Recommendations,</p>
<ul>
<li>unplug it :retard:</li>
<li>leave it unplugged for a while (good few hours, overnight to be extra safe)</li>
<li>just before opening it bridge pin 14 (green wire) to ground(black) this should remove any residual voltage (don’t worry this is save, this simulates pushing the power button.)</li>
<li>look but don’t touch. There is no reason to be rubbing your fingers across the bottom of the board. If one of the caps still have power you could bridge just the wrong two pins and light your ass on fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again My guess is that the fuse is fine (It is still sending some power to the board, usually the side effects of a blown fuse is no power whatsoever) and that the thing is borked. Get a new one from newegg, there fairly cheep. I recommend Antec, but Corsair is also equal in quality.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://promotions.newegg.com/Antec/041910/index.html?cm_sp=Homepage_Top_V1-_-Antec041910-_-https://promotions.newegg.com/Antec/041910/980x130.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Antec is having a sale right now</a></p>

<p>bah modular overrated. I say just get more components so your using every port.</p>
<p>But yah, that sounds like a bad PS. If your feeling adventurious open hey up and see if one of the fuses is blown.</p>
<p>JUST A WORD OF CAUTION if your retarded or are not good with electricity don’t open it. There is enough power to knock you on your ass or possibly kill you in there.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If a fuse is blown is there any possibility I could replace just it and not the entire PS?</p>
<p>I tried throwing my PS in an ancient dell and it didn’t run, unfortunately the ancient dell’s PS was to ancient to run my computer so I couldn’t test my parts. I’m still working on getting a hold of a power supply from a friend.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for all the feed back.</p>

<p>I was plugging in my cd drive to my computer and forgot to turn it off first. When I plugged the cd drive’s 4-pin molex into the power supply it sparked and the computer died. The computer won’t turn on anymore. The MOBO’s light is still on. So how do I figure out what’s fried and what isn’t? :fffuuu::’(</p>

<p>How do you figure out what’s frid and what isn’t?  Welp, is your keyboard still on and does your mouse still light up?  Yes? Well then… you are good to go on those two!</p>

            <p>it is always a possibility that you can damage the main board after an electrical failure, BUT it is not from the norm for a bad power supply to decide to only output some of the voltages, and only on some of the rails after catastrophic failure. IE the 6v line could be out and your only getting some power on the second 12 rail. Power supplies do weird things when they die (exploding included).</p>

            <p>I dont think a PSU is the only thing. There might be a good chance you fried something else. Maybe some of that electricity followed back and fried your cpu unit too. Seeing as all the lights and fans are still on.</p>
