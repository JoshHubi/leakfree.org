    <title>20gb flatrate with cap</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/20gb-flatrate-with-cap/5687</link>
    <description>hi ive got a small problem.
my internet plan is a 20gb flatrate with cap. Im 2 days away from the new month and im 20gb&#39;s over my cap because they havent capped me yet. 
I havent changed plans either, and when i logon to my account and have a look at my plan it still says 20480mb limit, the next plan up is a 40gb plan so i definitely havent been swapped to another plan.

Should i keep abusing my internet untill it caps if (if at all?)</description>

            <p>That is because just about all the ISPs route through 1 ISP (the most expensive one - yay for monopolies).</p>

Back in the Perth location I had paid 80 bucks for 80GB ( max 40GB download / Max 40GB upload ). It was more expensive because it was wireless. It was a 6M connection though.</p>

            <p>Usually they won’t cap you… if they explicitely said that they would block your internetz when you go over the limit and cannot be charged unless you tell them so, you should be fine. Otherwise, expect a nice bill…</p>
<p>Last year when I lived in university residences, they were providing us the Internet access. We had a 100gb limit per month (for a 4-rooms appartment), and since we weren’t paying directly for the internet, they capped us if we went over. But we noticed they only updated the bandwidth usage at the end of each day, and blocked only then if needed for the rest of the month. So the last day of the month, we technically had unlimited download lol. After a few months of downloading 90-95Gb the first 30 days, and another 100Gb on the last day, they changed their system to update the bandwidth more frequently  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Like Black Mesa of course.</p>
<p>I’m curious though, have you noticed any strange activity around your house OP? Those internet police bandwidth guys are sneaky little things. :ninja:</p>

            <p>A year ago,  i always busted my 20gb/month download limit, my dad was pissed off to pay the extra each month, so he changed it to a 100gb/month plan, it cost less than the extras that he paid and we get 30mb/s  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I remember paying a 450€ bill because I totally forgot about the cap one month.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have unlimited internet now.</p>

            <p>hi ive got a small problem.<br>
my internet plan is a 20gb flatrate with cap. Im 2 days away from the new month and im 20gb’s over my cap because they havent capped me yet.<br>
I havent changed plans either, and when i logon to my account and have a look at my plan it still says 20480mb limit, the next plan up is a 40gb plan so i definitely havent been swapped to another plan.</p>
<p>Should i keep abusing my internet untill it caps if (if at all?)</p>
