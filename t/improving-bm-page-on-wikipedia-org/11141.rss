    <title>Improving BM page on Wikipedia.org</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/improving-bm-page-on-wikipedia-org/11141</link>
    <description>I was wondering that the [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game)&#39;]Black Mesa page on Wikipedia[/url], while being already good, isn&#39;t updated with the newest events (post-release, I mean).

Since I actually do not have time to do it myself, but I see here a lot of people with more time and dedication than me: would someone kindly update the page?
Especially the &quot;Reception&quot; section: some reviews are already out, and even [url=&#39;https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/black-mesa&#39;]Metacritic[/url] and [url=&#39;https://www.gamerankings.com/pc/683833-black-mesa/index.html&#39;]Gamerankings[/url] list Black Mesa. Something like [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life_2#Critical_reception&#39;]this[/url], with also quotations from game journalists. It would be give more &quot;impact&quot; to the mod, IMO.

Just an idea, don&#39;t yell at me.  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>Upon release of the retail version, I personally want to update the WIKI entry as well. When the time comes (and you’ll know), let’s all gather back here and update it.</p>
