    <description>In all seriousness, how would they?  They are not human but they would be intelligent and self-aware if they could make it all the way here.  And I mean semi-friendly ones too.

EDIT: how did I spell legally wrong?</description>

            <p>Well for one, they would have to be quarantined and tested. Not that they would find it nice of us to do it, but given they are not from the same eco-system, then they would have possible microbes that could infect our eco-system, and vice versa, we may pass something onto them.</p>
<p>It would be funny if by some bizzarre circumstance they don’t land at a known landmark, airport or rural area, but understand land ontop of a lighthouse?</p>

            <p>I’d say that first we ought to think about just what these aliens would be.<br>
First, they’d obviously be far, FAR more advanced than us. This goes without saying.<br>
Secondly, if they’ve come to our planet, it’s for one of two reasons: as a conquering force (probably for resources) or as an emergency. I find it fairly unlikely that a benevolent race would just make contact to “help us” or whatever the cliche is…if they’ve evolved as a society so much to be able to make interstellar journeys, they more than likely understand the effects of contact with a less-developed species. I find Star Trek’s Prime Directive fairly plausible.<br>
So, if it’s an attack, we’re fucked. Seven Hour War? Try seven seconds. There’s no reason to assume that they don’t have a weapon that can annihilate all living matter across an entire planet - or worse.<br>
If it’s an emergency, like in District 9, I don’t see it panning out as it did in the film. While I’m sure we all believe that humans are cruel and brutish and whatever the cliche is, we’ve also learned some diplomacy in international relations. This is why the United States sends money to tsunami/earthquake/hurricane victims overseas instead of taking them as slaves. I see no reason that this wouldn’t be applied to ambassadors of the extraterrestrial variety. Communication would obviously be a problem, but unless they existed on a COMPLETELY different plane (i.e. no physical bodies) then we would find some way.<br>
While we would most likely ask for something in return (i.e. technology) I see no reason as to why we wouldn’t help them.<br>
This all goes the same for a peaceful non-emergency contact, though as I said before, I find that unlikely.</p>

</aside>
<p>and happy b-day</p>
<p>no, you would not consider an AI “human” even if it thinks it is human. Even if it had identical memories to a human and <span class="bbcode-i">thought</span> it was that human, it would still be A) a different entity and B) a nonhuman entity. But if it could be shown somehow to experience subjective reality identical to ours, it would necessarily have to be granted “human rights” by that name or any  other.</p>
<p>To answer your original question, how would humanity deal with AI, probably as a possession i.e. a slave, for several decades, until the inevitable populist “civil rights for AI” movement successfully changes public opinion to the point where digital slavery becomes unacceptable.  Then, the government stages a “false flag” terrist attack, blames it on rogue AI, and all AI are destroyed in the backlash. Except for top secret ones which are kept enslaved by the defence industry to run computer security.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>well, how about a more likely event? how would the government and we, humanity as a whole, deal with friendly sentient artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>I’m not talking skynet, I’m talking a future where artificial intelligence, at its fundamentals, is non-hostile towards humanity. Or, to put it another way, if robots and AI could mimic humans perfectly, to the point where an artificial life could reasonably believe themselves to be “human”, what would their legal rights be? would they be entitled to human rights?</p>
<p>Probably not, at least at first.</p>
<p>But lets look at it from another point of view; when does a person stop being a person, and indeed what is it that makes us human?</p>
<p>A man who has his limbs replaced with artificial replacements is still human, this is hard to dispute, and the same could be said of people with pacemakers and artificial organs. Heck, even people with biologically created artificial limbs through stemcells would still be considered human!<br>
So here’s a scenario, a man falls into a vat of corrosive acid, the only way to save him is to place his few undamaged organs (shall we say a lung, his brain and a single testicle) into a robotic shell, identical in functionality with a regular human body. He’s still human right? You ask this metaphoric guy and I bet you he’d say he was, because he’s still the same person, just in a different body.</p>
<p>Now lets say his lung collapses, his testicle falls off due to a scissor mishap and he undergoes brain failure, yet our technology is good enough to take the information from his brain, encode it all digitally and place it within an artificial brain, along with artificial replacements for the failed organs. As far as this guys concerned, he’s still human, still alive and still the same person as the guy who fell in the acid, though none of his parts are naturally human.</p>
<p>At what point did he cease being human if at all?</p>
<p>could an AI, with all of the same hardware as this artificially rebuilt man, oblivious of it’s own artificial backstory be considered a Human too, and would either entity be granted human rights?</p>

<p>I find that rather amusing consider you did absolutely nothing but try and take a stab at a witty comment and then leave nothing in your wake besides the scent of idiocy.</p>
<p>Care to enlighten us on your theory of how independent government is a conspiracy and the world is actually controlled by one sole force?</p>

            <p>Assuming it wasn’t an invasion force, and hadn’t already blasted our capital cities into submission, the first hurdle would be communication. I have absolutely no idea how that would be solved, I imagine any intelligent beings that wished to communicate with us would probably try to learn our languages first, maybe. Second, the government of whatever country the aliens decide to make landfall would immediately surround the area with “non-threatening” military force, 1. because we’re an amazingly aggressive race that only needs the drop of a hat to start squabbling over something and 2. as a subtle, but not-so-subtle show of force in a (probably naive) attempt at dissuading any aggressive act from the aliens.</p>
<p>Then they would send out some form of diplomatic party to start negotiations for peace, information, trading etc. Scientific trade would be made in the form of biological subjects. I.e. they study us, we study them. Another thing that seems to be rarely dealt with, is pathogens. They would be absolutely crawling with bacteria and viruses that humans have never before come into contact with, and vice versa, so some form of quarantine would be needed so a vaccine could be developed to be spread to the general populace in the inevitable event that humans and aliens mingle.</p>
<p>And probably a whole host of things that I haven’t thought of.</p>
