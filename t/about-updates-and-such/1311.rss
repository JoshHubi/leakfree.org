    <title>About updates and such</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/about-updates-and-such/1311</link>
    <description>Just to get it clear. I know the mod is not dead. I also know that the developers are putting updates on youtube and twitter, and i know someone is going to want to flame me for this post, but hear me out.

The front page has not been updated with any info for 9 months, and i know that the developers are working hard on the mod and is prioritizing this over media updates and such, but don&#39;t you guys have a guy/gal responsible for PR ? 

I&#39;ve been telling people about Black Mesa, and they all goes &quot;whoa!&quot; when they hear about it, but when they go home, look it up on google, and ends up at the front page they usually go &quot;d00d! teh MoD iz DeAD&quot;, because of the missing updates. It seems to me like the developers are deliberately trying to make outsiders (read: people who are not registered on this forum) believe that the mod is infact dead. 

First impressions are important to any business,it be a mod or anything else. And when the first impression of this mod is screaming &quot;WE HAVENT DONE ANYTHING IN ALMOST A YEAR&quot; even though this is not the case, people will get thrown off.

So i suggest you whip your Public Relations-person, and atleast do something about it, so that the rest of the world (read: people outside the forums) won&#39;t leave the site as soon as they see the frontpage.</description>

<p>Never ceases to surprise me how many people labour under this misconception.</p>
<p>The front page had received several updates in that time, but they were lost in the website/forum crash a few months ago. Since then, updates have been done via the youtube channel/twitter feed instead, as you know.</p>

<p>We choose not to.</p>
<p>If a person wants to believe we are dead, good, then they wont come here suggesting ideas or questions which have been done to death and can be found/answered by the FAQ or searching. Once the mod is released they will be like “OMG ITS OUT HOLY CRAP BLA BLA BAL…SURPISE!”</p>
