    <title>Steam Gift that I can no longer see</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-gift-that-i-can-no-longer-see/13089</link>
    <description>So I recently bought Killing Floor for a friend as a gift. However, after sending it to him, he hasn&#39;t recieved anything , and I cannot see anywhere in my steam account that says it&#39;s pending or whatnot. I checked my bank account, and it says I bought it. I have email confirmation that I bought it. So any ideas om why it isn&#39;t...existing?

EDIT:[b][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]Problems resolved[/b], though I&#39;m not sure how or why this happened. This thread can be closed now haha</description>
