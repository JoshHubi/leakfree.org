    <description>I installed Black Mesa correctly and opened with Steam.[b] But the entire game it&#39;s in Spanish![/b] :&#39;(

And in the audio language options only says Spanish.
I need to change the Steam language?

I have my Steam in Spanish, if I change it to English, the game will re-install automatically? or if I start it again it will be in English?

what can I do?</description>

            <p>The game does not have Spanish dubbing, so the voices should not be a problem. But yeah, there is support for the options and text in Spanish, so that could explain why you see some things in that language. You’ll need to change the language of Steam to English, indeed.</p>
