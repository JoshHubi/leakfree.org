    <title>Mod Version Engine Error</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mod-version-engine-error/62842</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried reinstalling and doing both the torrent, and the 2 zip files, but whenever I try and start the mod version of black mesa, the only thing I get is this error: 56/ - func_brush: UTIL_SetModel: not precached *14.
I have no idea what&#39;s causing this and I created this account to try and fix this error. If anyone could help me solve this error, I would be very greatful! Thank you!</description>

            <p>I suspect it might be a SteamPipe related issue. Something might be causing the wrong content to be mounted.</p>
<p>Try adding these launch options: <code>-console -dev -condebug -conclearlog</code></p>
<p>These options won’t solve the problem, but might get you to the menu screen and bring the console up. Then type <code>path</code> in the console to see what content is being mounted. It should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
] path
---------------
Paths:
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\bin\" "EXECUTABLE_PATH" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\platform\" "PLATFORM" 
"c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\bms\" "MOD" 
"c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\bms\bin\" "GAMEBIN" 
"c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\bms\" "GAME" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\hl2\bin\" "GAMEBIN" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\hl2\" "GAME" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\ep1\bin\" "GAMEBIN" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\ep1\" "GAME" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\ep2\bin\" "GAMEBIN" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\ep2\" "GAME" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\episodic\bin\" "GAMEBIN" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\episodic\" "GAME" 
"c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\bms\" "DEFAULT_WRITE_PATH" 
"c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\bms\" "LOGDIR" 
"d:\games\steamlibrary\steamapps\common\source sdk base 2007\platform\config\" "CONFIG" 
</code></pre>
<p>Also, check a file called <code>console.log</code> (generated by <code>-condebug</code>) and see if there are any clues there as to what’s going on (you may need to load a map to trigger the error.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, do you have a <code>VConfig</code> environment variable set? You can override it by adding the <code>-NoVConfig</code> launch option. <s>Also, check if you have any Source games/mods in your <code>PATH</code> environment variable (user/system).</s> EDIT: The <code>PATH</code> environment variable is probably not going to affect anything unless you run <code>hl2.exe</code> from the Run dialog or Command Prompt.</p>
