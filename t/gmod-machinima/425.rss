    <title>Gmod Machinima</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gmod-machinima/425</link>
    <description>I decided to let this out in the open.

Anyway, yes. I am making a gmod machinima based on the Original Fan Fiction by Zach Archer.

I have done 3 episodes already, And another 23 on the way.
None of them have been uploaded yet, But..

I do need help from you guys.

I&#39;ve had some help already, Thanks to those.

I can&#39;t think of a decent name and logo.
Like Icton&#39;s. That is unique.

Does anyone have any ideas for a name and logo?

All I can do in return at the moment is a block in the credits for every machinima episode. 

Thanks.  :smiley:</description>

            <p>Don’t look at icton as a role model for machinima. All you nee to do is watch TV.</p>
