    <title>[bug] How to break an elevator [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bug-how-to-break-an-elevator-fixed/9656</link>
    <description>First, here&#39;s the required info:

Map: bm_c1a1a at: 1319 x, 1808 y, -448 z

Pos: 1319.504272 1808.179565 -448.468750;setang 11.261879 -95.059372 0.000000

What went wrong:
This is the first elevator after the main incident.. if you get onboard, and activate it, but are partially off the elevator while it lifts, you will take -1 point of damage and the elevator will lower back down and you will not be able to activate it again. Only way to continue is to reload from earlier save.</description>
