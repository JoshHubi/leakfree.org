    <description>Is there a sentences.txt for Black Mesa, and if there is, where is it?  ?(   I&#39;m trying to reconstruct the military vox voice lines (which are awesome!) into single .wavs for my own personal use. However, I want to use the alarms like buzwarn.wav and dadeda.wav with them, and I can&#39;t find which alarms to use for which sentences. And I don&#39;t want to spend time listening to the actual sentences ingame. Help is appreciated!  &lt;3 

If your not sure what I&#39;m looking for, here&#39;s an example from Half Life 2&#39;s sentences.txt:
COMBINE_ALERT0 npc/combine_soldier/vo/(v100) on2(p110) contactconfim V_G0_PLAYERS, range V_DISTS meters, bearing V_DIRS degrees off1 {Len 1.13 closecaption NPC_Combine.Alert}</description>

            <p>Thank you! I’m a big fan of your VOX addons!! I’m using Audacity to compile the .wavs, and I’m just making them for personal amusement</p>

            <p>Yes, there are sentences.txt located in resource folder that can be found in bm_misc_dir.vpk. For example, the VOX system at the end of OAR,</p>
<p>[tt]<br>
C2A2C_launch_0 buzwarn(p95) buzwarn(p95) buzwarn(p95 e95) satellite(e70) launch(e70) system(e70) activated. {Len 9.13}<br>
C2A2C_launch_1 twenty(e75) seconds(e70) remaining {Len 3.71}<br>
C2A2C_launch_2 fifteen seconds {Len 2.76}<br>
C2A2C_launch_3 ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero launch(e65) is(e70) go {Len 14.84}<br>
[/tt]</p>
<p>The announcement file is then compiled with script which look like this:</p>
<p>[tt]<br>
response “announce_rocketlaunch”<br>
{<br>
sequential<br>
norepeat<br>
sentence “!C2A2C_launch_0” soundlevel “SNDLVL_TALKING”<br>
sentence “!C2A2C_launch_1” soundlevel “SNDLVL_TALKING”<br>
sentence “!C2A2C_launch_2” soundlevel “SNDLVL_TALKING”<br>
sentence “!C2A2C_launch_3” soundlevel “SNDLVL_TALKING”<br>
}<br>
[/tt]</p>
<p>But a personal opinion is that to not use them for the time being and just use external programs to combine the words wave file to construct a single sentence wave file and use that to play sound in the map.</p>
