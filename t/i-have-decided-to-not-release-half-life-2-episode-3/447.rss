<p>1812 ended up a status quo, return to borders of 1789 and bring back a king to France. The war was against revolutionary France then the Napoleonic empire, no for financial or territory gains. War ended by the defeat of Napoleon, nothing else.</p>

            <p>what I gathered from that wikeped was this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>British Casturated Americans with lulzy insults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in a desperate attempt to tell themselves they still had a ballsack americans attacked their peacefull neighbours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The british came and Pwned the butthurt americans (all while fighting a war with france) and let the canadians torch the white house.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT SRSLY:</p>
<p>we still love you guys. even if not so much as you love yourselves. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>A large chunk of the forces that torched the old white house were killed by a FUCKING HURRICANE soon after.</p>
