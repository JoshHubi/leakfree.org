    <title>So I can&#39;t play when C: is full?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-i-cant-play-when-c-is-full/11819</link>
    <description>serously who was so stupid to program that?

steam can&#39;t cope witha full partition?

I CAN&#39;T put the game files in the standard folder as C: (My SYSTEM partition) is full.


and as far as I&#39;m concerned i tend to put my games on another partition than my OS. especially with windows.

and now steam is to dumb to cope with that. are you fukcing kidding me?</description>

            <p>Or you can do what others have suggested and just move the Steam executable and the steamapps directory (so you don’t have to redownload all the games and keep your save files) to a new location on a new partition or new drive, then run the Steam executable and allow it to reconstitute the other files, then delete the old Steam directory.</p>
<p>Steam is really quite portable like that.</p>

            <p>I Installed Steam in [noparse]D:[/noparse], it’s only way to get steam to use the temp folder made for ([noparse]D:[/noparse]) (or whatever where you want to store you game), so your only hope is uninstall steam, reinstall to another directory and your finished, if you got any other games on steam you will have to re-download them but don’t worry your progress should be stored in Steam Cloud</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-i">Mod edit: </span>Protip: You can use a “noparse” tag around things you don’t want to become smilies.</p>

            <p>it is possible to move steam to another partition but that won’t help install the mod without leaving at least 6gb free on C:\ because the self-extracting archive always extracts to C:%temp%</p>

            <p>Don’t worry as Steam already update the client. Now you can install new Steam directory at other partition than C:</p>
