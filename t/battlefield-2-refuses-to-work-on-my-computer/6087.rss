    <title>Battlefield 2 refuses to work on my computer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/battlefield-2-refuses-to-work-on-my-computer/6087</link>
    <description>Battlefield 2 (Steam version) tells me that I have an invalid CD key when I try to join a multiplayer server. I know it&#39;s valid, it&#39;s the one STEAM gave me. Does anyone know how to fix this? Google turned up absolutely nothing.

            <p>I’m having the same problem. Let me know if they give you a solution.<br>
Steam Support is some of the worst customer service ever spawned. I got my account hacked, and it took the 9 days to respond – goddamn fuckers.</p>

            <p>I hope you tried Steam support.  They’re pretty helpful, not to mention they have the most direct access to your account and your problem.</p>

<p>I bought BF2 yesterday since it was on sale, but it won’t play. When I join a server, it says my CD key is invalid, and when I try singleplayer, it crashes to desktop without an error message. Does anyone know how to get this game to work?</p>
<p>I know my PC can run it, even though it’s shit.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m downloading now. I bought it cause it was on sale aswell. I’ll let you know what the outcome is and get back to you.</p>
