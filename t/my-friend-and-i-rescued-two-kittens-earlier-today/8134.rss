We were walking/Urban Exploring in what used to be the Woodhaven Sports Center, four blocks away from my house near Franklin Mills Mall. While we were leaving, we heard a faint, screechy meow. Under some plywood boards inside a sealed-up cardboard box, we found two kittens. They weren&#39;t injured or anything, but they were cold and frightened; They were laying on a gross patio chair padding with two water-soaked cloths. We weren&#39;t far from the nearest Animal Hospital, so we took them there. Unfortunately, they don&#39;t rescue animals much, so we asked my Father to drive us to the Women&#39;s Humane Society, about a 5-minute drive. The time we were in the car, we took pictures, video, and tweeted about it. We got them to the Humane Society, where they were rescued successfully. I also donated $2.00 and one of our old towels. The vet told us if we let those kittens there, they would have been dead by the end of this week. :[ Who would do such a thing to two cute kittens? Well, no matter. They&#39;re in a safe place now. If one of the kittens we rescued gets well soon, I will take one of them home and name him/her &#39;Sundae&#39; (My current cat&#39;s name is Chocolate). And at our 2nd Thanksgiving dinner today, I was thankful that the kittens are in a safer place now.  :slight_smile:
