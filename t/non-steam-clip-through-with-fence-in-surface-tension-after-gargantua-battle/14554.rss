    <title>[non-Steam] Clip-through with fence in Surface Tension after Gargantua battle.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/non-steam-clip-through-with-fence-in-surface-tension-after-gargantua-battle/14554</link>
    <description>Hello team,

playing in the non-Steam version of Black Mesa: Source it is possible to clip out of an area in the chapter Surface Tension. After the Gargantua battle  with the air strike tower ([url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590645890[/url]), I was looking how to progress further.

[code]&gt; status
map     : bm_c2a5g at: 1058 x, 6091 y, -39 z
&gt; getpos
setpos 1058.655396 6091.500000 -39.150352;setang 10.052700 -18.087234 0.000000[/code]
I saw a couple barrels in the water and figured I could stack them up to get past the fence ([url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590645801[/url]). I jumped on those barrels and crouched through the gap. After that, I arrived at a corner which I also tried to jump through ([url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590645856[/url]). There is no way to get out of that clip anymore.

I&#39;ll look for a different way to progress. :p</description>
