    <title>Mouse acts like joystick</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mouse-acts-like-joystick/10108</link>
    <description>When I start a new game, the mouse starts out acting normal. If I press any key on the keyboard, the mouse goes into a mode where it acts like a joystick. That is, when the invisible pointer is to the left of center, the player turns left constantly. Same for up, down and right. The movement gets faster the more the pointer is off center. Centering mouse stops movement.

Quitting the game (back to desktop) and restarting resets the mouse behavior, but any keyboard entries after the game has started triggers the glitch. Mouse in menus behaves as expected before and after glitch.

Running windows 7 64bit. Initially used Razer diamondback mouse with current driver. Attempted to use logitech mice (usb and PS2) with same results. Plugging in joystick had no effect (worth a try?).

            <p>PROBLEM SOLVED:</p>
<p>I went to see if there were any other games that had this problem and found this post on a minecraft forum:</p>
<p>“Anyways, after giving up for a night and trying again I was able to resolve this issue myself.  It turns out the problem was caused by a program I had installed called Synergy.  If this is happening to any of you guys out there, try uninstalling any programs that capture mouse and keyboard movements.”</p>
<p>I had synergy installed on my computer, uninstalled it, game works fine. There was a process with the name synergy in it, you can’t end that. You have to uninstall the program.</p>

<p>That did not work. Still the same problem: mouse works fine until I press the first key on the keyboard and after that the bug stays until I restart the game.</p>

<p>Same here. Deleting the config had no effect. I’m going to try reinstalling the game.</p>

            <p>Try deleting your config.cfg. It’s in your steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS\cfg folder. This should reset your setting to ship default and hopefully fix your problem.</p>
