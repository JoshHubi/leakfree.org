    <title>Some things and glitches i&#39;ve noticed.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-things-and-glitches-ive-noticed/14209</link>
    <description>Hello!
I just (finally) bought the game a couple of days ago.
And, as a huge HL fan i can say with not a single drop of doubt that, this game sure is the best thing that has ever happened since the invention of Quesadillas.
But enough of praises (I&#39;m sure you get them all day long).
I made this post to report the discrepancies/bugs/glitches etc. I get to find on the game (like most of us)
First my specs:

Operating System: Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit
System Manufacturer: TOSHIBA
System Model: Laptop Satellite L40D-A
Processor: AMD A6-5345M APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics (2 CPUs), ~2.2GHz
Memory: 4096MB RAM
Available OS Memory: 3266MB RAM
DirectX Version: DirectX 11
Card name: AMD Radeon HD 8410G
Dedicated Memory: 753 MB
Shared Memory: 1408 MB

I know, i&#39;m gaming on a laptop. *sob sob*
Now. The issues.
First, the generalized ones:

1.-At the very first part i Noticed that some Scientists&#39; Ties twitched from left to right really fast. I just remember Eli and the Fashionista Scientist having this issue.
I can&#39;t make a gif of it. But i hope a static pic might suffice.

*EDIT* This was BEFORE the 0.1.0 update i still have to check if the ties stay on place now.

2.- Way forward on the game i noticed that everytime i crouched, the crossbow casted a shadow on itself and the hands of Gordon from the FPV.
Here&#39;s the pic:

As you can see i&#39;m at an area that gives me light from the ceiling.
Every other weapon keeps it&#39;s light as i crouch. But not the Ninja Crossbow!
(I also have this &quot;thing&quot; at multiplayer)
I&#39;m not sure if this is normal or a bug. But meh. Here you go. Execute me Combine-Style about it later.

*EDIT* This &quot;thing&quot; is still there after the 0.1.0 update.

3.- Loading Times take way too long.
At the beginning, It had to take 45 seconds to more than a whole minute to load the next screen. Settings were on high (and recommended for my system by the game) on Model, Texture and Shadow Details. After reducing them to Medium the Loading times now take 20-30 seconds.
One could say &quot;Your system sucks&quot;
But my Loading times at Half Life 2 games take less than 10 seconds and their settings are on High by default. So it&#39;s something with this particular game.

4.- I&#39;ve got this one today after the 0.1.0 update.
I left my character at certain part of Residue Processing. The 1st person view displayed Gordon&#39;s HEV suit gloves and suit (obviously)
But when i Loaded my game AFTER the update... Gordon became a HEADCRAB ZOMBIE! :

The ONLY things i modified AFTER the update was selecting the G-man on multiplayer and i played my first match on it. (It&#39;s awesome)
*EDIT* I just had to start a new save file. No worries!


Now. The localized ones. Issues on specific parts of the game:


6.- On Residue Processing i have a HUGE stutter issue (it almost freezes) on certain part of the moving bands.
Heres is the data of the place.

hostname: Black Mesa
version : 100001/24 100001 insecure
map : bm_c2a4c at: 331 x, -415 y, 329 z
players : 1 humans, 0 bots (1 max)
edicts : 1092 used of 2048 max
# userid name uniqueid connected ping loss state adr
# 7 &quot;The Lonesome Calavera.&quot; STEAM_ID_PENDING 09:09 19 0 active loopback

setang -7.349858 -6.476220 -0.857022
setpos 367.968750 -441.768768 328.338806;

Never had that kind of stutter on the rest of the game. It&#39;s JUST on that part. And i get it EVERY time i go through it.

2.- At Questionable Ethics my framerate falls quickly on this part.

hostname: Black Mesa
version : 100001/24 100001 insecure
map : bm_c2a4e at: 55 x, -928 y, 432 z
players : 1 humans, 0 bots (1 max)
edicts : 1399 used of 2048 max
# userid name uniqueid connected ping loss state adr
# 3 &quot;The Lonesome Calavera.&quot; STEAM_ID_PENDING 14:11 29 0 active loopback


setpos 55.990337 -928.434387 432.031250;setang 15.568277 -179.762527 0.000000

I&#39;m usually at 60-70+ FPS on the game. But there it drops to 20.
Also, a bit little further from there i get a Loading screen.
This one took almost a minute to load.</description>
