    <title>The Combines</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-combines/11707</link>
    <description>It is mentioned that the Combines are one large intergalactic empire that has attacked and enslaved different planets in different universe. This leads to some question I need to know.
1. In Half Life 2 and its episodes, we have never seen the Combines directly, closest are the Synth forces that the Combines have, half-animal,half- robot, and the Advisors.Is there a main alien race of the Combine Empire?
2. An Empire requires a leader to lead the entire empire. Breen was just a puppet ruler of Earth. Advisors are the &#39;somehow&#39; true leader of Earth for Breen. But there are more than 1 Advisors, is it possible for the Combines to have one central ruler (Combine Overlord, Combine Emperor)?
3. Although not a question but, why haven&#39;t the Combine invaded Xen yet? I have 2 theories.
 1. In order to open a portal to Xen, a large concentration of energy and matter is need.( Nihilanth keeping the portal open from Xen, teleportation lab in Lambda Core) I assume that the Combine don&#39;t have the technology to teleport to Xen.
 2. Xen is the borderworld, it is also the mid section between two dimensions. Maybe the Combines aren&#39;t able to attack Xen yet as their teleportation technology can only teleport to any location within the same dimension. In order to open a portal to Xen, concentration of energy is needed or a mineral or crystals charged with energy is able to open an unpredictable portal to Xen.(Black Mesa Incident)

What are your theories about the Combine Empire and Half Life Universe?</description>

            <p>If I remember correctly in Half Life Raising the Bar. A quote from a cut character (Eli Maxwell or Captain Vance I think) said something along the lines of “Advisors where once a race like us but there over reliance on technology transformed them into a grub like creature”</p>
<p>While this may not be canon. I think it is an interesting concept. I mean Advisors certainly do use technology a lot. For breathing, grabbing and eyesight, and the rest they do with Psionic powers.</p>

            <p>That would be cool. I hope all those leaked concepts end up in the game in some form, or at least their spirits.</p>
<p>I’d love for Half Life to pick up a new aesthetic after nearly a decade of eastern European doom and gloom.</p>
<p>I mean, HL1 to 2 was a huge stylistic change. They can (and imo should) do it again.</p>

            <p>AFAIK it was the Combine who enslaved him and killed off his race (He says “I am the last” just before you enter the portal to his lair).</p>

<p>Probably because the Nihilanth wasn’t expecting anything from that direction. It might be able to prevent incursions from one universe or set of universes, but not all at the same time. Its plan in HL1 was to get through the dimensional breach the scientists created and invade our universe, so it could be even further away from the Combine - so it makes sense that it’d leave other entrances unguarded so it had a chance to do just that.</p>
<p>Also, the humans do have better teleportation tech than the Combine in some ways, that’s why they needed Mossman and Eli.</p>

<p>Well, that explanation still works if the combine had to tunnel through Xen on their way here.</p>
<p>There was also that scene in Xen in OP4 where you can see race X coming out of a portal in Xen and going into one that leads to earth, IIRC, so that would support it as well.</p>

            <p>Yeah she says the Combine are reliant on conventional transportation once they arrive in our universe. Having local teleporters is one advantage the rebels have. From the events of Episode 2 though, it seems like if the Combine get their hands on the Borealis they might negate that advantage by repurposing Aperture’s teleportation technology. I’m guessing that is, or was, going to be a major part of the next installment, though who knows at this point.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the only way to earth is through Xen; it’s intrinsically linked to our universe somehow, as indicated by the fact that it’s so heavily involved in local teleportation.</p>

            <p>I know this thread is old, but I love this sort of thing so I’ll contribute my two pence.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="iAmaNoob">

<ol>
<li>In Half Life 2 and its episodes, we have never seen the Combines directly, closest are the Synth forces that the Combines have, half-animal,half- robot, and the Advisors.Is there a main alien race of the Combine Empire?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The Combine isn’t any one race, but a collection of races. So, in that sense, the human forces are as much the Combine as the synths or the advisors or anyone. It’s implied that the advisors might have been the original race that started the Combine, but that’s all conjecture.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="iAmaNoob">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 iAmaNoob:</div>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>An Empire requires a leader to lead the entire empire. Breen was just a puppet ruler of Earth. Advisors are the ‘somehow’ true leader of Earth for Breen. But there are more than 1 Advisors, is it possible for the Combines to have one central ruler (Combine Overlord, Combine Emperor)?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s possible, but I doubt it. That’d be too cliché and judging by what we’ve seen it seems more appropriate that there is no central leader but merely a collection of advisors. Human empires require a leader (at least thus far), but Combine is very definitely not human, they seem more like an ant colony or even a single entity.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’d even say the advisors are “leaders” in the traditional sense. If you think of the Combine as a single living organism (which appears to be how they view it by the medical terminology that’s used) they’re more like the brain cells of the larger creature.</p>
<p>The advisors make the decisions, but not out of self interest or a desire to lead or even out of any ideological support for the empire, it’s just the function that they’ve been designed to perform, just as the function of the synths is to invade and fight insurrections, and protect the brain. Without the brain, the body can’t survive.</p>

<p>Personally, I’m kinda hoping for an energy being of some sort, maybe composed of the same stuff that appears when they use their telekinesis.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Interestingly enough, an energy being was a concept enemy / obstacle from very early on, they were called Particle Storms. Valve likes to reuse old concepts, so we’ll see how it goes. Although original Particle Storms were “wild” and just as dangerous to the Combine as they were to us.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“If you’ve never been out there before, I have one piece of advice; At the first flicker of green light, you <span class="bbcode-u">run</span>! First storm I saw I made the mistake of stoppin’ to study it, that’s… how I lost my leg. I’ve seen them take out whole squads, reeling in Soldiers, tearing Gunboats to bits! Some say it’s only an electrical disturbance but if you ask me, there’s an intelligence in there somewhere. If only we could communicate with it-t, a force like that on our side… Now that would be a powerful ally.”  -Eli Maxwell</span></p>

            <p>Combines are robot things that aren’t robots with ugly faces and sometimes glowing eyes and slave people in the city and make them angry and sad.<br>
Also Combines make people fraid so when you kill them it gives them hop.</p>
<p>In seriousness though, there’s a lot to be explored. When it comes right down to it, considering the Combine empire spans multiple dimensions, what we <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> see during Half Life 2 and the episodes is a very very small glimpse into the empire as a whole. For all we know the Advisors could be at the bottom of the reigning hierarchy and there might be a much higher race at the center of the Empire.<br>
I’m sure Episode Three will take great strides in answering this question.</p>
