    <title>Engine Error?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/engine-error/13250</link>
    <description>First off, I did try to find the minidump file but there was none, I did not try to restart the game after this crash. The error was as follows: Engine Error - too many indices for index buffer..tell a programmer ( 32832&gt;32768 ) . I don&#39;t know if this is a Black Mesa issue or a Source engine issue. I had just entered blast pit and had noclipped into a part of the map not accessable normally and buzzed through a wall, upon coming back out of the wall the crash occurred and the error message at my desktop.</description>

            <p>Still, you attempted to do something that was not intended. You use console commands at your own risk.  There is no need to fix something that isn’t actually broken.</p>
<p>Not a bug.</p>
