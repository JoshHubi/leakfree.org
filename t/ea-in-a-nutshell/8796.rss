            <p>It’s basically a mod, yes. A mod which exists in the format of a level.</p>
<p>It would be very easy to distribute the level and play it online with others using vanilla-BF2. I might consider that when I run out of things I want to add (and find friends capable of playing with me). It would also be easy to take my vehicle additions, kit changes, etc. and turn them into a proper mod. The problem with doing a proper mod is that maps specify which kits and vehicles get included, so my biggest changes would only be noticeable if I replaced the existing kits/vehicles (or slightly edited every map to include my customizations).</p>
<p>Anyway, BF2 is a lot of fun to mod. All you need is Notepad and a way to edit ZIP files. Running BF2 in windowed mode (<span class="bbcode-i">+fullscreen 0</span> shortcut parameter) is helpful, too, for detailed error reports.</p>
<p>I played the game (and its demo) a long, long time ago… so when I came back to BF2 at its final version, 1.50, I was very pleased to see it had fully matured. Now, the booster-packs are included, there’s no more CD-check, and “Co-op” mode is now supported (meaning bots from “Singleplayer” may exist in a server online).</p>

<p>I’d have to agree, but only if it’s Day 1, overpriced, and/or affects multiplayer gameplay. That sort of thing just ain’t right. However…if you buy a game you like, and later on they make some reasonably-priced single player DLC for it, it’s just giving you more of what you like. I don’t see a problem with that.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I am in absolute agreement.</p>
<p>I will never get BF3 for extra reasons, though: It’s not moddable !!!</p>
<p>After wiping my computer and replacing Win2K with Tiny7, I decided to reinstall Battlefield 2. I also the final client-update which includes the booster-pack content they were selling for it.</p>
<p>I played some online, but then took more of an interest in modding it to my whimsy (and using bots as cannon-fodder). I torrented a russian package of the default 32|64-player maps which were given AI support (since the stock game only supports bots on the 16-player map types). Gotta love those russian modders.</p>
<p>I have now made these customizations:* I took some vehicle tweaks from an old mod I remembered, AIX, and implanted them into my BF2.[list][*]Nanjing now has a 5th passenger slot, in the passenger seat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Humvee seats passengers 5 and 6, in two empty passenger seats.</li>
<li>Vodnik seats passengers 5 and 6, one in the cab and one in the back. (There used to be another in the back, but it felt crowded, and BF2 doesn’t draw the HUD’s passenger-dots beyond 6 seats)</li>
<li>The MBTs all seat 2 extra men, who ride on the sides of the turrets, tank-desant style. (They’re vulnerable in vehicle-to-vehicle combat, but it makes it fucking impossible to sneak up and C4 the vehicle.)<br>
[/<em>:m][</em>]I copied Highway Tampa to tweak it:* Added lots of attack helicopters</li>
<li>Raised most spawns 80m so you (and the bots) have to parachute into control points</li>
<li>Figured out how to put custom vehicles vehicles into a map without needing to customize the BF2 base[list][<em>]<span class="bbcode-b">This is key.</span> A single level for BF2 can feature <span class="bbcode-i">any</span> customization. A total-conversion mod could exist in the form of a level for vanilla BF2. That’s how modular and moddable BF2 is.<br>
[/</em>:m][<em>]Ripped the BMP-3 from the Special Forces expansion pack, and put it into Highway Tampa so that the high number of tank-like vehicles doesn’t feel repetitive.[/</em>:m][<em>]Reactivated some unused helipads.[/</em>:m][<em>]Added two new control points.[/</em>:m][<em>]Replaced the classes (“kits”) with my own selection. With these, every bot/player is always capable of either healing troops, repairing armor, or restocking ammo. Infantry are [overall] less deadly from afar. And I took out hand-grenades since bots love to spam with them.</em> Assault-Rifle Medic</li>
<li>Shotgun Medic</li>
<li>SMG Engineer (with C4)</li>
<li>Shotgun Engineer (moar C4)</li>
<li>Rocket Engineer (AT-mines) who lacks a slot-3 weapon)</li>
<li>Sniper Support</li>
<li>Machinegun Support<br>
[/<em>:m][</em>]Shortened respawn-delay.[/<em>:m][</em>]Made it quicker to neutralize CPs but slower to conquer them. When a flag gets neutralized, the defenders have 45 seconds to respond and keep the enemy from capturing it. (It’s easier to win/lose with a side getting wiped off the map. I prefer games to end dramatically rather than with a slow trickle of tickets.)[/<em>:m][/list:u][/</em>:m][<em>]I imported the Carpathian Mountains level from the Point Of Existence 2 total-conversion mod, getting rid of some PoE2 custom-props to reduce the filesize.</em> Exchanged all the vehicles for their equivalent cars from vanilla BF2.</li>
<li>Ripped the MTLB APC vehicle from PoE2 into this standard-BF2 level.</li>
<li>Added some attack helicopters… (I will be importing an Mi-24 from another mod shortly)</li>
<li>Carried over my special assortment of kits.</li>
<li>Made the sides MEC-vs-China.</li>
<li>Renamed control-points. (Sorry, PoE2 team, but “North Farm” “East Farm” “South Farm” was really boring.)<br>
[/*:m][/list:u]Carpathian Mountains is sooooo much fun to drive around on. The Nanjing is especially enjoyable on those roads.</li>

            <p>I pre-ordered BF3 and got probably minimum 100+ hours out of it, plus I got Back to Karkand for free - which was excellent, because the B2K maps are 100x better in design and gameplay then the maps that the game shipped with</p>

            <p>The way I see it, EA and Activision are both trying to see how much they can lower their game’s quality while charging more and more until people start reacting. And by the looks of it, people are pretty happy to be buttfucked boiled frogs. I mean, all of this stuff could easily be implemented with the game’s release, same goes with DLCs, but they choose to cut it to make more money.</p>
