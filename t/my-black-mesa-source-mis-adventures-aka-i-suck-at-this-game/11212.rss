    <title>My Black Mesa Source Mis-adventures (aka I suck at this game)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-black-mesa-source-mis-adventures-aka-i-suck-at-this-game/11212</link>
    <description>Heyo everyone! My names MrBlazenGlazen and I&#39;ve been experimenting with doing let&#39;s plays and game commentaries for 4 months now. I&#39;ve never played Half Life 1 before (Heresy, I know) so I thought that trying out Black Mesa Source would be perfect. 

Now, watching this series may be very painful to watch. Because I have like -1000 to my perception skills. I probably passed by like 10 medical stations when I was at 15 percent health, and I had no idea what the hell crouch jumping was.  :stuck_out_tongue: 

But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m going to be making several edits in this series so you don&#39;t have to bear through all of the rage and wasted time I will be spending trying to figure out some of the most obvious puzzles.

So without further ado. Feast your eyes upon these videos I will be periodically posting! Also I&#39;m a sucker for feedback, so that would be pretty nice too!

Also I realized that the music was too loud. I&#39;ll be fixing that in my next play session.

            <p>Well…for some reason I can’t figure out a way to properly adjust the aspect ratio to a point where it fills up the entire black space, without it looking stretched. Maybe camtasia is the problem, I can try uploading the next video simply using windows movie maker and see if that’s any better. Also, Fraps apparently doesn’t record my voice and the game audio separately like camtasia does. So it’s not letting me re-adjust the volume settings there.</p>
<p>After I’m done uploading this session, I’ll play around with camtasia and windows movie maker to see if I can improve the video and audio quality for the next recording.</p>
<p>Anywho, here is episode 5. I think there are about 3 to 4 more episodes left before the session is over.</p>

<p>What do you mean, nothing I can do? You could restart from scratch, and fix your aspect ratio too since it’s obviously stretched.</p>
<p>Why would anyone be bothered to watch those if you were so lazy while making them?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because I already filmed 1 and a half hours of gameplay, and I’m trying to do live commentary. If I restart from the beginning then it really wouldn’t be that entertaining imo because I already would know what happens. You see, I’ve never really played Half-Life 1 before, so that’s why I decided to record this. As for the aspect ratio thing, I’m not really good at editing videos. I’m using camtasia to edit the videos (or at least attempt to since I kind of suck at doing that) and I’m simply selecting the youtube suggested aspect ratio. For some reason it doesn’t fit the entire screen, so I’m stretching it. I’ll try out the different resolutions before I upload the next video.</p>
<p>As for why anyone would bother to watch the videos, um. Maybe for entertainment value? This isn’t really a top-notch/pro-gamer walkthrough that I’m shooting here. If you were expecting the latter than, well, I’m sorry. And if you weren’t entertained in the slightest then there isn’t much I can do there, I’m simply being me.</p>

<p>Can’t really hear your voice on the first video that well.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, I know. I didn’t take in the fact that the game audio was probably louder than my voice. I’ll fix that in the next play session. For now I’m just going to upload this session as is because there really isn’t anything I can do to fix it at this point.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback though!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
