    <title>I deserve a (yet another) medal</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-deserve-a-yet-another-medal/6267</link>
    <description>My apartment&#39;s bedroom is infamous for tripping the circuit-breaker. It tends to use most of the electricity in this joint, yet its three outlets are stuck on a single breaker.

Back when I didn&#39;t live alone, and my ex had her desktop here, we were unable to start our towers up at the same time because it&#39;d throw the breaker. Sometimes, when both towers were running, throwing the [i]light switch[/i] would cut the bedroom&#39;s power. I used to think that instance exemplified how on-a-hair my electricity consumption was, that a lightbulb could put it over the limit.

I was wrong.


Today, comrades, I had two of MY towers running. One was playing music. I have a modem, a router, two monitors, one set of forward speakers with woofer, and one external hard drive. (Elsewhere running in the bedroom was one alarm clock, and...that&#39;s it. No lights were on.)

And then I did it.
One computer had been plugged into the router, as I was still setting up the modem. I was using the second computer, now, to proceed activating the DSL, so I decided to plug it in.

WHAM!
As soon as I got the cat5e into the back of the router, my power went out. In the bedroom, at least. MY ETHERNET CRASHED MY FUSE BOX :fffuuu:


Either the router drew too much power handling a second connection, or the PC activated its ethernet card and drew too much power... either seems like a ridiculously small amount of current. So that&#39;s my story, I hope you enjoyed. And if you know anything about circuit breakers, would it be possible (and safe) for me to find one which has a higher tolerance, to install for this bedroom&#39;s circuit?</description>

<p>Erm, I’m not sure what you mean. Nobody can replace it but me. In fact I wasn’t aware until now that breaker-age could be to blame, that degradation to a lower tolerance is possible or routine.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.allexperts.com/q/Electrical-Wiring-Home-1734/circuit-breakers.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.allexperts.com/q/Electrical-Wiring-Home-1734/circuit-breakers.htm</a> says:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>it is estimated a quality made breaker is reliable for approx. 10 years…under NORMAL circumstance. After 10 years, the inner mechanism slowly becomes worn and realibility comes into question. If a breaker is tripped repeatedly or frequently…the electro-mechanics wear at an accelerated rate…the breaker actually becomes “weak” and replacement should be in order.</p>

</aside>
<p>Being extremely generous with the first figure from <a href="https://wiki.answers.com/Q/Power_for_a_computer_how_many_amps_does_it_take_to_run_a_computer_monitor_and_computer" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this site</a>’s responder,</p>
<ul>
<li>6 amps for 2 computers starting up</li>
<li>4 amps for running 2 monitors (specs say 1.6a consumption each)</li>
<li>2 amps for external hard drive (spec says 1.5a out)</li>
<li>3 amps for router (spec says 2.5a out)</li>
<li>2 amps for speakers (spec says 1.2a out)</li>
<li>1 amp DSL modem (spec says 0.9a out)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total worst-case overinflated scenario, I’m drawing 18 amps. Going by the specs everything gives, 10.7 amps of the 20 <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> be available to the desktops (but to be fair, there’s an alarm clock I have no measure for). I’m guessing now that my problem is due to an old circuit breaker that doesn’t reach its promise of 20.</p>

<p>If you don’t think your whole thing draws 20 amps, you could get the breaker tested, it’s possible that it now trips way under 20 amps.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Very possible, considering the stuff is anywhere from 9 to 39 years old. It’s the only circuit breaker of its style in the box… meaning the rest might have been replaced more recently. I’m almost certain it’s pre-90s composition. Definitely no later than 1995.</p>

<p>Thanks, this actually sounds like a good idea… my bedroom’s breaker is only a 20-amp! (The hot water heater gets 30, the central heating has 40, and the stove is allowed a 50 amp tolerance… I think the bedroom could do well with 30.).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s not how it works… you can’t just swap the breaker for a bigger one. It’s 20 amps for a reason. Mostly the wiring… Water heater, stove, and other energy-hungry equipments use bigger wiring and are made to draw more current. Allowing more than 20 amps to a few bedroom sockets could be dangerous, and if you catch fire for any reason, it could very well void any insurance you have.<br>
These kinds of changes have to be made by an electrician anyway, otherwise you might end up voiding insurances as well.</p>
<p>The only solution is to go get power elsewhere, or to move equipments to other rooms. You could get an extension cord through a wall / closet.</p>
<p>If you don’t think your whole thing draws 20 amps, you could get the breaker tested, it’s possible that it now trips way under 20 amps. List your equipments, with their wattage, and you’ll see.</p>
<p>Edit: oops, double post</p>

<p>fun fact, I have a friend who doesn’t have breakers, they have fuses that need to be replaced when they trip so his dad installed fuses that take more amps than the wiring in the walls</p>

            <p>Just because something uses 0.1 amps doesn’t mean it can’t trip the circuit breaker when other stuff already brought it to the limit.</p>

            <p>Computers don’t draw much power. Neither do routers or anything related to computers. That is because these all operate on transformers, mostly on 12 volts, so they could easily work on batteries as well. Of course, drawing lots of amperes is what causes circuit breakers to break the circuit, not volts. But these things don’t draw lots of amps either.</p>
<p>So I’m pretty sure something you own is actually faulty, and it is causing temporary short-circuits, which also set off the breaker. Could be the transformer in your computer or router, or anything.</p>
<p>Because once again, light bulbs, washing machines, ovens, electric heating and hair dryers are the ones that eat loads of amps and can set off fuses, not the high-tech stuff that run on low voltage and wattage.</p>

<p>Sure, if you can turn off the power or if you have a screwdriver with an insulated handle and good nerves. Check the throughput of your current circuit breaker and get a heftier one. We had a 25A one and the welding machine used to set it off when coupled with other power hungry appliances. So we got a 40A one for like 15$ and it’s all good now.</p>

            <p>you can move in any time my parents take in any crackhead… had 2 tenants (not at same time) both smoked weed, the 1st one was a compulsive liar, in the end he jacked my laptop, xbox360 with gta4 and halo3, one 26" HDTV, one 19" LCD screen and my mom’s money stash, the other tennant just went crazy and started talking to himself after a few weeks. Neither one paid even half of the rent.</p>
