    <title>Catz&#39;s computer died!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/catzs-computer-died/2573</link>
    <description>NOTE TO ALL MY FRIENDS: My computer refuses to boot and I dont know how long I will be without internet!  I am on my son&#39;s laptop right now, but this is not a permanent solution.  Below is a string of info that Carlos and I went through to try to troubleshoot, but in short, please don&#39;t rely on me being here for a while.  I am convinced this is gonna cost money, of which many of you know I DONT HAVE. So I may be gone a while.  =(

 The power goes on, front panel light on, cd drives lights blink, power supply fan on, video card fan on, dirt cleaned, plugs all tight. I dont get &quot;beep.beep&quot; noises tho and no &#39;boot menu&#39; is sent to monitor. Eventually my front panel light shuts off even tho all other &#39;power&#39; seems to be on. Shutting down and trying again, for the 15th time.

 That happens to me sometimes when there is another device the computer is trying to boot to. Try unpluging everything but your monitor, keyboard, and mouse and see if that helps.

Oh and make sure there&#39;s no CD in the CD drive.

If your BIOS doesn&#39;t post to the screen that sounds pretty bad. I&#39;d say some core component inside has gone bad. I&#39;d try removing your RAM one stick at a time and hoping it&#39;s that. Are you sure your monitor is working/plugged in tight? If absolutely nothing shows up on it, it might be your video card. You can try borrowing a monitor from someone to check that it&#39;s not the monitor. If this all fails it may be your motherboard or CPU. But all signs point to hardware failure

 I saw on one of the boards to take out each memory stick and gently rub the copper plating on both sides with an eraser... that this gets rid of static electricity. I made sure they snapped tightly back in. I took out the video card to see if it would &quot;beep&quot; at me but nothing. (it has an onboard video card, so removing my radeon wouldnt matter ...

Did you try removing one stick of RAM at a time and booting without it though? If it&#39;s bad it could prevent the pc from booting. Not all motherboards beep for these kinds of problems. It is highly likely your data is safe, this sounds like some other component has gone bad.

 Didnt do that. I took them all out, gently wiped them and rubbed them, then put them all back and tried to boot. I will do it your way.

 Here is something weird to note though. This has happened before. At least twice in the last year. But after turning the puter on and off about 10 or 15 times it would finally boot like nothing was wrong. (We rarely turn our puter off) This morning hubby was on it for a while, but when he went to shut the computer down, it didnt power down  / turn off fast enough so hubby pushed the button to MAKE it turn off without waiting. I am not puter savy, but isnt that REALLY BAD TO DO? GAH all memory sticks were checked! Not working.

You could try checking your CMOS battery. If this has happened before that seems like a likely source of the problem. [url]https://bit.ly/6PQ2QS[/url]

 feeling your pain. willing to bet that your data is not gone, though. probably still residing on your HDD. Sounds more like something wrong with the motherboard.

            <p>I just wanted to know cuz I have the two to choose from and I wanna make sure I have the better one plugged in.</p>
<p>I would give the other video card to my kid’s 8 year old computer however it doesnt have a PCI-E slot.  Go figure!  I will probably give it to the IT dood next door that is helping us.</p>

            <p>I stand corrected, I thought the GF7 series had CUDA as well.  Could’ve sworn my 7950 GT had PhysX support, but maybe my memory is faulty…</p>
<p>Anyway, which of those two cards is pretty much open to speculation.  The GF7900GS has the better GPU (even a GF7600 outperforms the x1600, so a GF7900 is definitely better) and DDR3 VRAM, but the ATI has twice the video RAM even if it isn’t DDR3.  That could make enough of a difference to make a benchmark necessary to tell which one is better.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m a nVidia fan, so I’m really just trying not to be biased against the ATI card out the gate.  In this situation, I would carefully inspect both cards for defects and dust buildup, and especially for fan functionality.  It won’t do you any good to use that higher end card if the fan is seized up and doesn’t spin under power!</p>

            <p>The Radeon is probably the better card, though it’s a very close comparison.  The GeForce has Nvidia PhysX support, while the Radeon is slightly faster and has twice the memory.  If you have two PCIe slots in that machine, I would put both in and just use the GeForce as a dedicated PhysX card.  If not, then I’d probably go with the Radeon.</p>

            <p>I’m glad that things seems to be on a good way. I’m so upset that I’m so far from you and can’t help locally <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Anyway I can send you C2D E6600 and 1GB Corsair 1066 RAM. I have Commando motherboard too, but it’s killed three of RAM modules (same situation after computer started-black screen and nothing at all) and its working stable only with one module inserted now. I’ve upgraded whole PC so I can send that components with 36GB Raptor HDD. I will be very happy if I can help in any way. Just PM me ;o)</p>

<p>Well, if Rabid doesn’t work out, I have an old P4 lying here… the only thing you got to do is switch the harddrives (and preferably pay the send costs, since I too am a bit broke)…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I would have to illegally sneak that shit across the border but I live kinda close…</p>
<p>Anyway don’t bother trying to replace the capacitors, they might not be the only components damaged.</p>
