    <title>Abortion</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/abortion/3523</link>
    <description>Well, since it&#39;s been suggested subtley in the Healthcare Bill thread, I&#39;ll make it.

What are your opinions on abortion? Pro-Life? Pro-Choice? Pro-Abortion?

I, myself, am Pro-Choice because I think a woman has a right to do with her body whatever she wants. I feel that life begins at birth, not conception. And an abortion can stop a child from living a completely fucked up life with a family that doesn&#39;t want them in the first place, or that is completely unprepared for the child.


Your opinions. KEEP. IT. CIVIL. ...Ish.

Also, mods since this is a rather touchy subject, I understand that closing it might be necessary, I just believe it could be good to see others&#39; opinions on the matter.[/SIZE]</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>A point to make to the ‘pro-lifers’:</p>
<p>If you’re so fucking committed to premise of ‘saving’ a fetus from abortion, why don’t you hop on down to your local abortion clinic. Then when a pregnant teen is about to go in, offer to adopt it. If she can’t abort it, why don’t you fucking take care of it if the issue is that important to you?</p>
<p>IMHO pro-lifers are both arrogant and elitist by imposing their world views and values upon others. If you don’t think abortions should be done then don’t fucking have one, and don’t be so arrogant and high-handed that you think the right to choose whether to abort or not should be taken away from women.</p>
<p>As George Carlin said: Pro-lifers aren’t pro-fetus, they’re Anti-Woman.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, with regards to your ‘potentiality’ arguement, how do you respond to people having vasecotmies or having their tubes tied? Surely they’re killing ‘potential’ children.<br>

the human zygote’s development actually allows one to follow evolution to an extent</p>
<p>it goes from worm-like to reptile-like all the way to mammal-like and primate-like</p>
<p>you can actually compare the zygotes in different stages to zygotes from other animals and see the almost identical similarity</p>

<p>if this is enough proof that lizard was humans ansetor than that sould be same for that human was ancestor of lizard. humans have devolved to lizards!<br>

<p>A human zygote with a complete human DNA structure is created with a new set of distinctly human potentialities.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, it’s the same set of potentialities as the sperm and egg. You’re defining things as potential or actual based on whether or not it serves your argument.</p>
<p>You want to make the argument that a zygote has the potential to be a person, therefore it is an actual person. THAT is the argument.</p>
<p>A sperm and ova have the potential to become a zygote, therefore, according to your own argument, since they have the potential to become a zygote, they are an actual zygote.</p>
<p>But now you don’t like potentiality. So, you want to say that a sperm and egg AREN’T a zygote. You want to separate their potentiality and actuality as two discrete things.</p>
<p>OK - fair enough, then we shall separate potentiality and actuality into 2 discrete things, as they should have been all along. But now you don’t have an argument for your zygote. Because potentiality and actuality are 2 different things. A potential person is NOT an actual person.</p>
<p>Or you can keep your potentiality argument and say that jerking off is mass murder.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Biology textbook, 10th grade, page 120. Look it up, Assassin, thank you.</p>
<p>Abortion’s cool. Lol foeti being alive. Sure they are, everything is. Given the fact that living things get murdered all around I don’t see how that point defends the foetus much. Compared by the “IS ALIVE” property, foeti sure go on the same row as grown-up people. Along with trees. And lichen. Or anything else that’s not a rock, basically. Life is universal. Human life’s a specific concept, defined by our species’ ability to exert cognition. If you think foeti have such a property you are outright wrong in your beliefs. A foetus doesn’t think. A foetus doesn’t have pattern recognition skills. A foetus can’t do calculus. If you think they have the potential to do all those things though, well yes they do, I accept that. The fact of the matter, however, is that you can’t kill a concept. You cannot label abortion morally wrong, since a morally wrong act would be killing a human being. Not the potential of it. Not the concept of it. As bur pointed out, everything has potential. I’ve the potential to become a great writer, but the future holds only two possibilities, that I either do or do not.</p>
<p>Now you’d argue: This isn’t about possibility at all! Okay you’re “probably” not going to become a writer, but it’s not the same with a foetus! It has a natural course, it isn’t “possible” for it to either be or not be born! It’s not its choice, nature has it that a foetus develops and is born at all odds!<br>
Now, technically, that’s not right, we all know about miscarriage. But that’s not your argument, is it, it’s about choice and nature. Why should we make such a choice for our unborn child? Why should we interfere with nature? Why should one deny a foetus its <span class="bbcode-b">potential</span> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6St07K4e2VM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">evolve</a> into a human being? As for the woman, we’re going into the “reasons to get an abortion” zone. I believe those have been covered so far. Most if not all of them are justified. As for the foetus itself, look at the previous paragraph, the answer is right there. And about interfering with nature - nature is not the end-all be-all. Evolution has run its course and we’re the result. We’re the next big thing after bacteria and we’re exerting control over evolution because it’s what we must do. People have been breeding dogs for centuries. They have been eliminating malignant bacteria since the advent of medicine, therefore wiping whole virus strains off history’s records. Are those things natural? No. Are they normal? Yes. It’s what a sentient race does, excel nature. Bluntly speaking, the unwanted child is inferior to other human beings. Emotional trauma of the parent and inbreeding (rape and incest), or inadequate upbringing conditions (due to lack of funds, parents being too young etc). Take abortion as the next step of culling, survival of the fittest. Not natural selection - artificial selection. One that’s not dictated by physiological characteristics but by reason on our part. [COLOR=‘Black’]OH FOR FUCK’S SAKES I’M NOT WRITING ANY MORE ON THIS DUMBFUCK SUBJECT ON AN INTERNET FORUM I GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH MY LIFE GOD DAMN OKAY COOL BEANS</p>
<p>An interesting side-note: If you get “cloned”, you don’t get “reborn”. Fuckwit. You’re defined by your conscience and not your body. If you were to be cloned, genetic information aside, the clone would be a completely different person. Even if you were to, say, transmit your conscience into another entity, it would be just a copy job, the real you is still gonna die. Doip.</p>
<p>PS: YEAH THAT’S RIGHT IT’S FOETUS NOT FETUS GET WITH THE TIMES</p>

<p>bother having a distinction between natural things and unnatural things?  If it’s not something that it would do on its own if it could, then it is not part of its nature.

<p>So wait, natural activity is what something does on its own if it can. We went to space on our own and we could, yet it is not natural? You’re making arbitrary distinctions here.<br>

<p>can you please address this? especially the last one, which is perfectly in line with your potentiality argument, only extended further</p>
<p>Also, you said that a zygote and a foetus <span class="bbcode-i">look</span> like a human being. It absolutely does not, not until well into the pregnancy. Early zygotes/foetuses look almost exactly the same as the foetuses of reptiles, sheep, etc., which is proof of our common ancestry.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not sure if you’re asking me or Assassin, but I’ll go over what I said again, in case I wasn’t clear enough.  The things I’m typing make sense to me because I’m typing what I’m already thinking in my head, so maybe I left some parts in my head and didn’t type them out.</p>
<p>Anyway, I earlier drew a distinction between the potentialities which sperm and ova have and the potentiality which a human zygote has.  I’m defining them by using their teleological ends, mind you.  The teleological end and ultimate potentiality for a spermatozoan is to fertilize an ovum, or not.  Those are the two basic potentialities that it has.  The converse for the ovum; it’s ultimate potentiality is to be fertilized by a spermatozoan.  Once the fertilization takes place, the ovum and spermatozoan cease to exist—something completely new is created.  A human zygote with a complete human DNA structure is created with a new set of distinctly human potentialities.  Just because my parents were the cause of me being born does not mean I am the same as them.  Aren’t you not the same as your parents?  You might be a genetic amalgation of them, but you are clearly distinct.</p>
<p>Similarly, a bunch of inanimate carbon (theoretically) might have the potentiality to evolve into conscious beings, sure.  However, if/when it does evolve, it becomes something completely new, and when it does, like the sperm and eggs, it hits the end of its potentiality.  The newly evolved substance now has a completely new set of potentialities that are distinct to whatever it is.</p>
<p>I think we’re focusing too much on potentiality here.  The underlying reason that I even brought it up is that the zygote which is formed after fertilization has completely human DNA, which is something that nothing but a human zygote can have.  It is <span class="bbcode-i">uniquely human</span>, and therefore human.</p>

<p>But before you do that, you should understand that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your position dictates that abortion is immoral because your belief that a fertilized ovum constitutes a person via potentiality. The other potential leads to the opposite conclusion - that a fertilized ovum does NOT constitute a person because it does NOT have that potential. This gives the position that abortion IS moral. Same argument - YOUR argument - with a different conclusion using a different potentiality. That’s what happens when you use fallacious forms like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your position treats a potentiality as an actuality. It says, since this thing has the potential to be X, therefore the thing is actually X. This is a completely false statement.

Sex is a natural human activity, cloning is not.  However, that’s not even important.  It is the spermatozoan’s nature to fertilize an ovum.  Even if it were possible for sperm to come into contact with ova without human interaction, then they would still try to fertilize.  If you let a glob of human cells that could be used to make a clone just sit around, it wouldn’t turn into a clone–it is not in its actual nature.

<p>By ‘outside’ forces’ you mean ‘people’ - the same outside forces that are also responsible for fertilized ova.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Like I said above, even if humans were not responsible, a spermatozoan would still try to fertilize an ovum if it could, as it is in its nature.  It is not in the nature for human tissue to turn into a clone.  Have you ever seen that happen?  I haven’t.</p>

<p>Again, it’s not unnatural, it’s a human activity, in the same way that fucking is a human activity.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So all human activity is natural, and all activity moreover?  Why do we even bother having a distinction between natural things and unnatural things?  If it’s not something that it would do on its own if it could, then it is not part of its nature.  Going into space is not natural, we can’t even survive out there without creating special suits.  I’m not saying that unnatural things are inherently bad, just that they aren’t natural.</p>

<p>It’s natural and it’s exactly the same genetic material that you have chosen to discuss and label as ‘potential person’ or in the case of your argument, ‘actual person’.</p>
<p>You’re saying that some genetic goo is a person, but if it’s inconvenient for your position, you want to ignore it even though it’s exactly the same genetic goo? It’s a rhetorical question mark.</p>

<p>I think I’ve already addressed these points, and I have to go to class.</p>

<p>what makes you say that? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>
the human zygote’s development actually allows one to follow evolution to an extent</p>
<p>it goes from worm-like to reptile-like all the way to mammal-like and primate-like</p>
<p>you can actually compare the zygotes in different stages to zygotes from other animals and see the almost identical similarity</p>
<p>these were in biology text-books in highschool</p>
