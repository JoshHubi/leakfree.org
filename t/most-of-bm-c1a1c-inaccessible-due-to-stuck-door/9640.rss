    <title>Most of bm_c1a1c inaccessible due to stuck door</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/most-of-bm-c1a1c-inaccessible-due-to-stuck-door/9640</link>
    <description>There is a door in bm_c1a1c, just after getting the weapons, that blocks access to the rest of the level. It&#39;s transparent and bulletproof. It&#39;s partway open such that I can throw grenades through it.

Somehow this thing needs to open, but the action button isn&#39;t doing it, I can&#39;t break it with anything, and the only NPC that I can get to is chilling in the security station.</description>
