    <title>Can&#39;t launch the game from Steam at all - nothing happens</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-launch-the-game-from-steam-at-all-nothing-happens/10239</link>
    <description>I click on &quot;PLAY&quot; from the library and it registers the click because the play button moves, but no launcher. I have the 2007 SDK and L4D2 so I know I have the required files. All my other steam games work fine, but this one won&#39;t launch at all.  I also can&#39;t find a way to remove it to try and reinstall it, and it&#39;s not listed in my programs in control panel.</description>

            <p>Install Source SDK 2007, from Tools menu in STEAM (it’s a requirement). It was actually supposed to detect the fact that you don’t have pre-requisites installed and install them for you. Never happened to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, that fixed it for me… and made way for a whole heap of other problems with the game.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
