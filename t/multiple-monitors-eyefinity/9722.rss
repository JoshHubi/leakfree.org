    <title>Multiple Monitors / Eyefinity</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multiple-monitors-eyefinity/9722</link>
    <description>For some reason I am not able to get BM to detect/play on a triple monitor setup.  Other games I have work fine and although I don&#39;t have it installed at the moment, HL2 used to work just fine too.

I&#39;m using a Radeon HD7700 Series - Catalyst, with Eyefinity to combine all three desktops into a &quot;single display&quot; at 5760x1200.

When I launch the game, it detects and displays at 1920x1200 and clones itself onto the other monitors.

I&#39;m not sure if BM supports multiple monitors - assumed it would because HL2 did.

I&#39;d greatly appreciate any help, advice or info anyone would be kind enough to share.

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Managed to solve the problem by tweaking some catalyst settings under “gaming”. All ready to play now - thanks again to everyone who helped.</p>

            <p>Forcing the resolution as you suggested worked! Thank you for the tip.</p>
<p>That said, a new glitch showed up once that was achieved - not sure if I should be creating a new thread for it. I’m getting these one inch thick horizontal bands running vertically up the screen. Seems to be an overlay issue because (from the intro) the band removes the trolly mesh revealing the background behind it. Once outside of the trolly, there’s a lot of flickering - but it seems to be the polygons themselves - although this is just a guess.</p>
<p>Might have blamed the monitor or the gfx card, but what’s interesting is that the monitor that experiences the problem is related to which monitor is set as “preferred” from the Eyefinity settings - which is to say that whichever monitor I set as the preferred display, one of the OTHER two experiences the problem. I’ve managed to produce the problem on one of all three monitors depending on which is set to preferred. Cursed!!!</p>
<p>Anyone experience anything like this before? Any idea how to fix it??</p>
<p>Thanks for such prompt replies - awesome, helpful community.</p>

<p>Anyone know if it’s possible to force BM into a resolution - or at least force a preset? Like injecting into a config file or something?</p>

</aside>
<p>You can manually tell hl2.exe to use a custom resolution with command options: -width [pixels] -height [pixels]</p>
<p>Just put your resolution in there, and it’d be -width 5760 -height 1200.  You can enter these in through steam, under the properties dialog, in the box that says Launch Options.</p>

<p>Eyefinity is definitely enabled. Do you have to use hydravision in conjunction to set this up?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it’s obvious BM is not the problem. Could someone perhaps point me to a place that advises the proper catalyst/Eyefinity setup - I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t spend 3 hours on the google trying to find it myself without luck. My problem is that it does currently work for other games (i use it for DIRT mostly) so there is some tweak I’m missing to make it work for BM I guess.</p>

            <p>After I chose 16:9 the 5760<em>1080 and 6xxx</em>1080 bezel corrected resolutions appeared in the list.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t work for you I don’t have much advice - are you sure your desktop is in eyefinity mode instead of extended desktop?</p>
<p>And I’m still using Catalyst 11.8 apparently, even though I swear I installed 12.4 ages ago.</p>

            <p>I suppose that’s a clue - I’m only presented with 4:3, 16:9 and 16x10 resolutions to choose from. Can’t recall what version of catalyst I’m using - installed it a month ago…should really be ok.</p>
<p>Any ideas what the problem might be?</p>

            <p>Weird. I’m playing at 5760x1080 just fine after I went into the options menu and changed the aspect ratio and selected the res. Using Cat 12.4 BTW.</p>
