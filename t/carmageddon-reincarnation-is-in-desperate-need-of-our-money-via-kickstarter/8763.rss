    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/carmageddon-reincarnation-is-in-desperate-need-of-our-money-via-kickstarter/8763</link>
    <description>You already know that carmageddon is the most awesome pedestrian killing car crashing, racing game ever made and pretty much the only one worth playing to this day!
The original devs of the game finally managed to get their rights back from SCI after 15 years and now want to make a Carmageddon sequel called Carmageddon Reincarnation.
They&#39;ve set up a Kickstarter.com page a few days ago and even though in the first few days the donations exploded and moved very fast, since 3 days now, they have slowed down very much!!!
They need to get to 400.000 bucks in order to get to keep the money, otherwise if they fail the goal in 21 days, kickstarter will send all the money back to their donors and the game won&#39;t be made anymore!
So if you want to get a sequel to the most awesome and gruesome racing game ever, DONATE NOW HERE AT THIS LINK AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!
[url]https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stainlessgames/carmageddon-reincarnation[/url]

And spread the news everywhere you can!
This needs to happen for all the reasons in the world!!!

Update: They added a new video to express their thanks and to ask the fans of legendary game series Carmageddon to spread the word and donate!

[b]Update:Troll kids need not apply in this topic or  [/b]

            <p>A new Carmageddon game… pinch me. I’m going to dust off my copy of Demanufacture when it comes out for the authentic experience  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>OT: What kind of people see a thread called “Carmageddon Reincarnation is in desperate need of our money via kickstarter!!!”, and the first thought in their head is to tell us how much they don’t like it?</p>
<p>I mean for real guys, I don’t like Angry Birds but I’m not gonna seek out fans of it to tell them. That’s the textbook definition of a dick move.</p>
<p>No one wants to hear about what you don’t like.</p>
<p>EDIT: Almost forgot, cheers for the headsup and vid links 3dwizzard; your enthusiasm is infectious  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Kickstarter is over and they’ve gathered $625,143 in donations out of their 400.000 goal.<br>
Now they are going to actually finish the game.<br>
If anybody from here donated, then my effort was not in vain!<br>
Cheers and you can lock this topic!</p>

            <p>Excellent!!</p>
<p>Glad the pledge made it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Cant wait to start modding this and making the blood splats more over the top and generally just super super gory!</p>
<p>I hope the pedestrians legs, arms and heads can be ripped off when you impact them with your car!</p>
<p>I hope you can do wheely spins on their corpses so blood sprays out from behind you, maybe blocking the windshield of the car behind causing him to crash and kill more pedestrians!..maybe a moose too!!!</p>
<p><em>giggles like a girl</em></p>
<p>Its going to be awesome!!</p>

            <p>Update:<br>
The goal was achieved today!<br>
The game is going to happen!<br>
If you donated to this project, congrats and thanks!<br>
If you want to see it made for linux or mac, you can still donate for 9 more days and if it reches 600.000 bucks that will happen too.</p>
<p>To all the naysayers and haters out there that wanted this to fail all I have to say is a big fuck you  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>

            <p>Update:<br>
Now they’ve added Carmageddon 1 and Carmageddon Splat Pack on <a href="http://gog.com" rel="nofollow noopener">gog.com</a><br>
You can get both of them if you have donated or will donate 25 bucks or more on kickstarter.<br>
That way you get both carmageddon reincarnation drm free and steam version + access to early beta and secret development forums + the <a href="http://gog.com" rel="nofollow noopener">gog.com</a> versions of carmageddon 1 and carmageddon splat pack.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Also another reddit AMA was done today.<br>
If you want to read the questions and answers, here they are!<br>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/u4ple/carmageddon_reincarnation_ama_2nd_natter_with/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/u4ple/carmageddon_reincarnation_ama_2nd_natter_with/</a></p>
<p>The project got 35.000 bucks donated to it just today alone!<br>
It’s becoming a phenomena now!<br>
More high profile gaming sites are starting to talk about it too.<br>
Gamasutra made their first article on it today!<br>
<a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/171061/Stainless_Turbocharges_Its_Kickstarter_Campaign_withGOGcom.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/171061/Stainless_Turbocharges_Its_Kickstarter_Campaign_withGOGcom.php</a></p>
<p>Keep spreading that word about the new updates added to kickstarter and we shall break the 400.000 goal and reach 600.000 by the time this ends!</p>
<p>ps. if a mod sees this post and has the ability to do it.<br>
You should remove the word desperate from the title of this topic, since it’s no longer the case of them being desperate for money!</p>

Just to possibly make it even better, after announcing the game will be DRM free starting yesterday, now they’ve announced that if the goal of $400.000 gets surpassed and reaches a new stretch goal of $600.000 they will also release the game for Mac and Linux!<br>
So if you or anybody you know want it on either mac or linux, once you donate 15 bucks you get the steam version for both mac and windows, and you also get a windows drm free version and a linux drm free version.<br>

<p>I am I am!!!</p>
<p>After a hard day at work and while waiting for dinner to cook, im sometimes to tired to ‘get into’ a game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>So sometimes playing something like Doom just for the bloody violence is relaxing for a while!</p>
<p>If I have had a tough day driving all day (due to job), then booting up Carmgeddon just so I can run pedestrians over in sick, violent, bloody, gory and sadistic ways is…well fun for me!</p>
<p>Yes I know there is more to Carmageddon such as actually caring about the race or trashing the opponents and I do play like that at times too.</p>
<p>I just enjoy options! - YAY</p>
<p>After all its a game and I enjoy what I get out of it…did I mention the blood and gore!!! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Here’s a great review of Carmageddon 1 and why it was cool.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=244C7aK7sQQ&amp;hd=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=244C7aK7sQQ&amp;hd=1</a><br>
It’s not about wasting defenseless civilians, you got it all wrong.<br>
The game is about wasting your opponents with your car or with all kinds of powerups you find through the level.<br>
The pedestrians are just there to make the game more realistic and more distrubed or funny, or however you find it.<br>
Nobody asks you to gore pedestrians but you can do it/ will most likely do it when you spin off or lose control, or when you simply want to get a few extra seconds to your timer.<br>
You can even turn off pedestrians in carma 1, with a simple press of a button if seeing gore disturbs you so much.<br>
A race can be won by destroying the other cars, or finishing a race through checkpoints, which normally nobody bothers to do because the real time damage physics of the cars are very fun and after 15 years, only GTA 4 managed to do something similar to the dynamic car damage model!<br>
The cars in carmageddon, will bend where you hit them and if you continue to hit them, they will bend until the entire car becomes completely unrecognizable.</p>

            <p>Diving right into the arguing here, for me it’s a no-brainer.</p>
<p>This game is about cars. Reason enough.</p>

            <p>Update: The Carmageddon Reincarnation game is now DRM FREE and the kickstarter page has more donation options between the already existing ones!<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
So if the idea of using steam was holding you back from donating, now if you donate you will get both DRM free version and Steam version at the same time!<br>

            <p>The donations are moving slower today, so if you haven’t done so, it would be great to check that kickstarter page out.</p>
