    <title>Ridiculous ties, quickload explosion, broken guard animations and more</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ridiculous-ties-quickload-explosion-broken-guard-animations-and-more/13953</link>
    <description>So I think some people experienced this bugs as well:

1) In some maps the ridiculous tie bug occurs, I originally thought it was due to the ventmod addon since that was when I first encountered it, but I encountered the same issue later in the game at some instances.

2) I have also experienced enemies that do not attack me, not just vortigaunts (or maybe this grunt simply doesn&#39;t believe that violence is the solution)

3)It seems that many coreography sequences throughout the game where guards move their hands around are broken. eg. in UC lobby (notice how the light from the telephone is on but he&#39;s not pressing it)

4) I tried to re-do this bug which I experienced in my first playthrough but currently nothing is happening. So in map [b]bm_c2a5e[/b] whenever I would try to load a quicksave the entire screen would go white and insta kill me, the way it does when you trip a mine inside the storage facility of the same map, not really sure what caused this, I&#39;ll keep seeing if it happens again.

5) Whenever I take the elevator that ends UC and starts OC the game suddenly gives you alot of ammo for your glock, I remember this bug was present on the mod version aswell.

6) Again in bm_c2a5e at the first sniper scene, everytime the sniper tries to kill the  scientist it takes him 2 shots to do it, it looks really odd.

I&#39;ll upload my getpos info whenever I can.</description>
