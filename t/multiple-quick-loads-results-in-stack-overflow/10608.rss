    <title>Multiple quick-loads results in stack overflow</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multiple-quick-loads-results-in-stack-overflow/10608</link>
    <description>It&#39;s a minor issue, but one I thought I&#39;d mention. Finally hit a point where I ended up having to quick-load quite a few times (a certain meeting with marines near the end-game) and after that 4th or 5th time it crapped out on me, tossed me back to desktop and fed me an overflow message.

No, didn&#39;t get a screenshot, going to try and make it happen again; but thought it worth mentioning just for the hell of having a look. 

Otherwise it&#39;s been smooth sailing, can&#39;t wait for the second release.</description>

            <p>I can kinda confirm this. I have not got an error message yet, but I once noticed that after a quickload, performance got really bad, indicating some kind of overflow.</p>
