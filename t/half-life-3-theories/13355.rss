    <title>Half Life 3 Theories</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-3-theories/13355</link>
    <description>I have a theory for half life 3 involving appertures portal technology.


I beleive the G-Man has always used the Portal Gun in order to be one step ahead of Gordon throughout the half-life series. If you play through the games throughly or perhaps with cheats you should notice the G-Mans continual reappearence throughout the games.

Adrian Shepherd is due to make his return, Adrian also being apart of G-Mans &#39;property&#39;

Adrian Shepherd from Opposing Force infact had a basic version of the Portal Gun, only he could send enemies or himself into the Xen world with it or if already in the Xen world bonus Earth Locations were visitable if Ammo permitted. 

I believe this is why G-Man was after him and helped him during early game.

I believe G-man wants or already has the apperture portal weapon and will use either Freeman, Shell or Adrian to get it for him, or to work for him with it.


It would be interesting to play as G-Man with nothing but the Portal Gun and perhaps a Time Lapse Devise. All of G-Mans secret scenes and Easteregg locations throughout the series could be made sense of, Every time the G-man helped or guided any of the Half Life Characters these events could be taken into account and perhaps played through on a time-lapse basis from the perspective of G-man, Perhaps all jumbled up and confusing but nevertheless the sense could still be made from it after repeated sessions, This could help solidify every episode of the series as G-man guides the events which eventually shape his future in bringin down the Combine and becoming the supreme commander of the Universe perhaps with Adrian Shepherd as an Inside man.


Anyway Besides the Point, I want to hear your thoughts. My opinion in one line is that G-Man has always used the Portal Gun to be one step ahead of Gordon, Adrian Shepherd, The Vortigons etc and i do expect to see the Portal Gun in half-life 3, only perhaps not for the characters we&#39;d might expect.

For the Record, half life 3 is not confirmed but it is an inevitability due to the cliff hangers they leave us on. Nobody ever expected a half life 2 but it still came. 

Thanks for Reading</description>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">The Clue is in the Title</span>, If youve lost interest/faith in the game and its future because you’ve came on this forum for too many years, don’t reply to this thread from now on. Don’t be spiteful either. Nothing leading up to this post needs justifying anymore because nobody but yourselves and others on here who use your behavior to justify their own, i.e ‘deliberately supporting a fucked role model’ actually care what you think your little attempts at encouraging suppression are achieving.</p>
<p>Chumtoad.</p>
<p>I don’t care any more. I can’t find any theory like my theory and my theory seems to be logical since the clue’s are there. Online theories are stupid. Point me to a good believable one. I bet ya can’t. You haven’t yet, I’ve Googled.</p>
<p>I enabled super grav gun by the cheat, i play through the game again finding Gman one step ahead. Portal reveals a portal gun, How does Gman get around? A portal devise of course. Gman wanted Mesa destroyed, Adrian is in suspension until further notice. Gman speaks badly of Black Mesa, Aperture is in the same world. Portal 2 takes place decades later. Gman probably owns Aperture or is apart of it. Gman talks about how he keeps track of many people and its hard to keep track of an individual like Gordon all of the time. Giving the Vortigons a chance to step in. He did say he had some interesting requests for Gordon’s services. He says he has a fascination with those who can survive. I think Adrian Shepherd was more interesting to Gman than barney because Adrian Shepherd actually obtained the Portal weaponry manufactured at Black Mesa, i think not only his fighting skills, as barney was a survivor, but also his Portal Gun. He was literally one step behind Freeman when he first went to Xen and could be the perfect guy to hunt freeman down, Using advanced technology of course.</p>

            <p>G-Man is Marc Laidlaw.</p>
<p>I don’t see Adrian Shepard returning in an official Half-Life game by Valve.  Maybe if Gearbox makes Opposing Force 2 or something you’ll see him but not in an official title.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Also, if the abuse by any person continues, I’m closing this thread.  Fair warning.  Use the report button to bring any abusive poster to the attention of the moderators.  Thank you.</p>

            <p>Take some reading comprehension classes. No where did Flatline outright insult this guy. He asked for thoughts and opinions, he got it. He got upset becuase someone didn’t like his theory, accused flatline of having 2 accounts and being off-topic. He sowed his own poison and made his own bed.</p>
<p>Back on topic, If you want to hear my stupid ass lame theory about G-man, he’s a time traveling humanoid alien sent back through time to stop Gordon Jr from being born. Oh, he’s also the representation of God/Satan.</p>

            <p>really? this is what i see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gerbil: Some theories and opinions about the HL and portal series from someone who isnt a veteran BM forumite/hardcore HL fan</li>
<li>Flatline: “Ridiculous! Not gonna happen buddy! Boring!”</li>
<li>some other dude: “nope²”</li>
<li>Gerbil: “Please give me some reasons instead of just dimissing me out of hand”</li>
<li>Various people: “OMG we dont have to prove anything, no one cares”</li>
<li>Gerbil: “well ok then ill leave”</li>
<li>Flatline: “oh NOW youre leaving?”</li>
<li>shitposting really takes off at this point</li>

            <p>poor troll 0/10 instead of being mad people are confused</p>
<p>also my theory for HL3 is that they will release HL2 Ep3 instead and after the end-game credits SURPRISE!!! half life 3 starts seamlessly without even exiting HL2 EP3</p>
<p>not really a theory but that would be awesome</p>

            <p>He thinks Adrian Shepard is canon and will return. How? ep. 3?</p>
<p>He thinks the teleporter is the precurser to the portal device. Are they? portal only works on what you can see and shoot, the teleporter is randomly shootin you off somewhere. He also thinks there is only ONE portal device, I’ve seen at least 3 in the Portal games.</p>
<p>He thinks a game about G-man shooting a portal/teleporter and staring at Freeman/Calhoun/Shepard would be interesting.</p>
<p>He asked to look for ‘evidense’ from the earlier games to back up his theory.</p>
<p>He told a moderator to stay on topic when it kinda looked like he went off topic himself.</p>
<p>He expressed his opinion or w/e and asked for theories on g-man/half life 3 then says something about age old rumors being repeated here.</p>
<p>He also told people to use Google. If he had done so himself, he’d have found all the g-man/half-life theories he’d ever wanted to read.</p>
<p>Does he still need his white knight?</p>

<p>Google What i put, Find it, and Post a Link.</p>
<p>I should nit pick your Moderator status shouldn’t i? Very Welcoming You.</p>
<p>Link Me.</p>
<p>Is that your Dom color?</p>
<p>If they were to intwine the two games in the last game as gordon enters the Apperture boat what do you think will happen?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Do that if you will. What does that mean? Search for yourself, they’re all recent threads in this sub forum. It’s not a Dom color, it’s so that we know that it’s a mod intervention and not possibly a joke or just discussion.</p>
<p>If they were to intertwine the games, as I said previously, it would be little more than some aperture science logos, research data, and MAYBE a little tech such as computers, dead turrets, etc.</p>
<p>Also, if us not taking it and agreeing with you is offending you and causing you to insult a mod and other members, then maybe online discussions aren’t for you. You are new here man. It’s not like we are familiar with you, nor are you impressing many people.</p>
<p>Edit: also, Adrian Shepherd is still pretty much non-canon if I recall correctly. He has no purpose in showing up in any other Half Life games unless Valve decides they can use him. As it wouldn’t make much sense to have him as a partner (since he played the same role as Gordon, being a silent protagonist), it wouldn’t make sense to include him further.</p>

<p>OK, you seem to be ignoring everyone else and picking on me which seems a tad unfair. I don’t think slander means what you think it does, as no-one has slandered you, or indeed could. And your last gibberish gets you an infraction on the basis that I assume you were trying to insult me.</p>

<p>It’s the colour I use as a moderator. I’m not sure what a 'Dom colour would be (though I doubt it needs a capital letter). And if you think I’m being unwelcoming, continue with your attitude and see where that gets you.</p>
