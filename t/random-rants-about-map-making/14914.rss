    <title>Random rants about map making</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/random-rants-about-map-making/14914</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;ve been experimenting a bit with monster_generics, to make scientists that use melee weapons.

It worked perfectly fine until somehow they all became non-solid. After testing removing a lot of stuff I find out that the only reason they&#39;re not solid,
is because they become non-solid if you place them onto the floor instead of a few inches up in the air.

GG, Hammer you so silly.</description>

            <p>Ouch. But at least you can blame it on Hammer.<br>
I recently added two func_tracktrains to my map only to find out the second one was glitchy as fuck. Tried absolutely everything… Then found out I parented the second tracktrain’s model to the first tracktrain, not the second.<br>
I’ve never felt this much like an idiot in my entire life, believe me.</p>
