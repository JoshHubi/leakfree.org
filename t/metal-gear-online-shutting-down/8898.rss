    <title>Metal Gear Online Shutting Down</title>

    <description>[url]https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/6/11/3078482/metal-gear-online-services-terminate-tomorrow[/url]

I played hundreds of hours of this game and it really is my favorite  online game I&#39;ve ever played. I was relatively competitive in this game,  which I don&#39;t commonly play online games like that. Sadly, it was  ruined by all the hackers, people who are unbeatable because all they do  is play the game (Barney Kills You and Blue Bandits), and CQC EX which  Konami introduced for some reason. 

Team sneak was my favorite mode and probably my favorite online game mode ever. It was pretty much capture the flag, but one team was invisible with only a tranquilizer and a knife and the other team was fully armed and visible. The sneaking team had to infiltrate the base of the other team and steal a duck/frog statue and bring it back to their base. So many memories. I can still envision the majority of the levels, from playing so much. 

I really would have liked to have  played a few more days before it was shut down but sadly I&#39;m not at a  place with access to the game right now  :frowning:  . Hopefully one of the upcoming Metal Gear Solid games includes a new version of MGO. Despite me being pretty much finished with Metal Gear Solid, I would be totally up for buying a new one just for MGO.</description>

            <p>MGO… woah spend lots of hours into that game aswel, me and some friends even made a epic MGO Vid called “MGO THE INFILTRATION”</p>

<p>Too Konami closed it, but yea they had no other option, leaking money to server maintenance without profit is a waste.</p>
<p>Time to move on!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>MGO did support dedicated servers and they were all over the place, but apparently everyone still had to go through Konami’s servers to get in game or something like that. So if Konami wanted to they could probably easily patch it so people with dedicated servers could still host them but I don’t think they will. I just hope that if they make another MGO that they don’t ruin it.</p>

<p>Well, all online Valve games are under the same masterserver infrastructure, so it’s normal that it still works.</p>
<p>Besides, it’s easier to keep running games with dedicated server support by just creating your own server infrastructure for it.</p>

            <p>I never really got that into MGO, but what I played it was fun, and I liked the sneak modes for being more than run and gun so it’s kind of disappointing to see it go.</p>
<p>Reminds me of this really stupid mod for GoldSrc, I used to play it all the time because it had a metal gear mode where one player is snake and has to sneak around, and he has a box and stuff which makes him invisible to the other players to simulate sneaking, and you could hold up people and stuff.</p>
<p>It was really fun, except it was a purposely retarded mod so the other modes were stupid and very little people played.</p>

<p>I played hundreds of hours of this game and it really is my favorite  online game I’ve ever played. I was relatively competitive in this game,  which I don’t commonly play online games like that. Sadly, it was  ruined by all the hackers, people who are unbeatable because all they do  is play the game (Barney Kills You and Blue Bandits), and CQC EX which  Konami introduced for some reason.</p>
<p>Team sneak was my favorite mode and probably my favorite online game mode ever. It was pretty much capture the flag, but one team was invisible with only a tranquilizer and a knife and the other team was fully armed and visible. The sneaking team had to infiltrate the base of the other team and steal a duck/frog statue and bring it back to their base. So many memories. I can still envision the majority of the levels, from playing so much.</p>
<p>I really would have liked to have  played a few more days before it was shut down but sadly I’m not at a  place with access to the game right now  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  . Hopefully one of the upcoming Metal Gear Solid games includes a new version of MGO. Despite me being pretty much finished with Metal Gear Solid, I would be totally up for buying a new one just for MGO.</p>
