    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/alot-of-black-mesa-errors/13024</link>
    <description>Hello Black mesa Team.
I decided to play game once again,

I find out that there are some bugs  come up in the course of months
Some of NPC are not talking or there are some Lichts error Flikkering.

So i did re-instal mod and Source engine 2006/2007
So nothing work so far

I have save file, but dont know how to uploud it,
so i desided to give hier 1 line of command it was saying.


Failed to load sound &quot;^weapons\357\reload_npc.wav&quot;, file probably missing from disk/repository
Attempted to create unknown entity type !
NULL Ent in NPCMaker!
