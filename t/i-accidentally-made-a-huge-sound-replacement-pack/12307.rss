    <description>Mostly for myself though. It&#39;s got some silly stuff that people might object to stylistically. Still, does anyone want it?

[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liQ3w754whM&#39;]weapons[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM7u24D6nb8&#39;]creatures[/url]

[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ouyWLeNJ_Js&#39;]Hgrunts[/url]

some stuff isn&#39;t done. I still gotta finish the rest of the Hgrunt scripted sequences and debate whether or not I want to do full replacements for the creatures I only tweaked a bit, but I&#39;m almost there.

            <p>Oh, yeah. I’m not even trying to change that stuff, though if I could I’d be tempted to. I’m just recording new lines that fit in the old slots. Hell, the extra challenge is kinda fun.</p>

<p>VCD’s, it controls their scripted sequences (when to say X, what to say next). I never felt like messing around with those, changing the length and whatnot to fit (having to guess the lengths too).</p>

<p>That’s a scripting level change that I have no idea how to make. What it needs is to be at max volume within a certain space. Right now the source of each sound is like a microscopic pin point that attenuates when you’re inches away from it.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to help out with that, I’d really appreciate it.</p>

</aside>
<p>I replaced the explosion sounds with classic stock explosion sfx and found the sounds to be underwhelming. What I did was increase the volume of each explosion, usually by duplicating it until it was at the right volume, so it sounded like a real explosion.</p>
<p>It did the job, although judging from what you’re saying, you’re wanting to change code in the sound engine. In that case, I don’t think I can help you.</p>
<p>I need to get back on code academy. . .</p>

            <p>I think the soldiers sound a little too Combine-ish, if you’re gonna give them a radio filter, I suggest do something along the lines of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPQ0_-1xbe0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>. Still though, they’re all nice sounds, the hgrunts are full of ham and cheese, but the good kind.

<p>That bug exists in HL2 as well (rather any source game for that matter). Don’t shoot them with the machine gun and you’ll be fine.</p>

            <p>I like the grunts… Well, I like their lines. They have really cool things to say, I especially like the redone scripted sequences. But in my opinion the wrong filter was put on them. They sound more like aliens being water-boarded than people.</p>
<p>While I do think that’s cool in the way of being totally different, it just doesn’t seem to fit with who they are and are especially jarring in the scripted scenes you’ve shown. Just my two cents.</p>
<p>The weapons and monsters however a perfect. I can’t really think of anything to say about them. But I suppose it is easier to explain what is off than what is spot on. So it’s my fault I guess.</p>

            <p>Just my opinion.<br>
While the other work sounded realistic and I thought very good, I thought that the grunts weren’t anywhere close to what they would sound like in reality.</p>

<p>I figured way early on there’s no pleasing anyone but myself with any alterations to the Hgrunts. No one wants anything other than a carbon copy of the originals, so why bother?</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, recording and studying this enemy class showed me that they can shoot the shotgun way too fast. I mean come on. They should either match the player, or the player should match them. Bah, digressing like a muthfuck. the last thing we need is another “bitch about Hgrunt AI” thread.</p>

            <p>Mostly for myself though. It’s got some silly stuff that people might object to stylistically. Still, does anyone want it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liQ3w754whM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">weapons</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM7u24D6nb8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">creatures</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ouyWLeNJ_Js" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Hgrunts</a></p>
<p>some stuff isn’t done. I still gotta finish the rest of the Hgrunt scripted sequences and debate whether or not I want to do full replacements for the creatures I only tweaked a bit, but I’m almost there.</p>
