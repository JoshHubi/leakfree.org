I&#39;m trying not to be hyped here but I&#39;m kinda failing.

It&#39;s open for pre-orders now.

            <p>I agree you can’t make a judgement with what we’ve been given. I’m gonna wait until I can get my hands on it to make reservations on it though. If it sucks, I won’t get it. I don’t see much point in speculation.</p>
<p>And I’m just kind of a natural optimist.</p>

            <p>It certainly bothers me that it isn’t in keeping with the original sequels, but I’d be fine with that if it seemed like it’s going to be a good game on its own. Judging from what we’ve seen of the gameplay mechanics so far, it’ll be too shallow to be what I’d call a good game. It strikes me as being dumbed down as much as possible so as to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Sure it looks cool, but looks only drive hype. Gameplay mechanics are what decides whether or not a game is actually fun.</p>
<p>Of course there are a lot of people who like casual games with shallow mechanics and there’s nothing wrong with that. I just feel like a lot of people who are looking for more depth in a game are being duped by pretty explosions and media driven hype, as they have been with many games of late.</p>

            <p>Honestly I think it looks really cool. BUT… it doesn’t look like battlefront. I feel like the majority of angry comments are people who want battlefront 3 to be like BF 1+2. This isn’t really a sequel, it’s more of a different game in general. When I think of it that way I don’t mind as much.</p>
<p>To be honest, space battles were the weakest part of BF2, so I don’t miss those. 4 planets = 12 maps? That seems fine. I can do without the clone wars… so I’m still pretty hopeful for this.</p>
<p>Call me naive. I’m an optimist. Sue me.</p>

            <p>So from the gameplay footage I’m even more non-plussed than I expected to be…</p>
<ol>
<li>God damn what is wrong with that HUD it looks hideous</li>
<li>A little petty, but the glowing power up symbols look stupid and completely out of place, as does the really mediocre looking 2D hologram pop-up in the Co-Op mode, seirously, why did they make so many sloppy/ugly aesthetic choices?</li>
<li>REGEN HEALTH as I predicted…</li>
<li>Overheat/recharge system on almost all if not all weapons instead of ammo/reloading</li>
<li>Really low time to kill, faster movement and in general jack rabbit on steroids pacing</li>
<li>Poor Weapon variety</li>
<li>Really smudgy looking textures on Hoth, they look heavily down-sampled (probably just the PS4’s fault, PC probably looks better)</li>
<li>Really excessive score readout for every single little thing you do<br>
It looks like this game is about as deep as a kiddie pool in California (you know, the drought and stuff?).</li>
</ol>
<p>Might not even try this game it looks so bad. Admittedly some of my comments are nit picky (the stupid score readout) but other stuff, like Regen health, are pretty much a deal breakers on their own.</p>

<p>I guess that the no class system thing was kinda predictable, since in BF4 classes weren’t all that different from one another.</p>
<p>20 vs 20? Source? Cos fuck that if it’s true.</p>
<p>Also I don’t understand why you would make a vehicle like the AT-AT on rails. According to them it’s because of “more freedom doesn’t always mean more fun”, whatever the fuck that means.</p>

            <p>DISCLAIMER: From the perspective of someone who loved SWBFI/II and thinks the Star Wars universe is a pretty cool one, but doesn’t give a shit about the canon or much of shit about the movies.</p>
<p>I’m completely unhyped.</p>
<p>From Dice’s statements on the game it seems like they’re cashing in on the Star Wars universe first and making a videogame, let a lone a Battlefront game, second. It seems like they’re making the gameplay simple, casual and completely inoffensive to the ordinary gamer because Star Wars is a huge cash cow and retro gameplay mechanics with depth such as Battlefront’s are not. I’m just waiting for them to announce regenerative health…</p>
<p>Now of coursewe have very little details and I could be totally wrong, I’m just extrapolating from the things they have announced:</p>
<ul>
<li>No class system</li>
<li>20 vs 20 matches</li>
<li>Hardcore PS4 shilling</li>
<li>only 4 planets (edit: a dev on reddit says that they’re at least more than 8 maps and that the maps/planets shown aren’t necessarily all that’s going to be in launch, so hopefully this part isn’t true)</li>
<li>no Clone Wars era</li>
<li>ATAT’s are, at least on Endor, on rails</li>
</ul>
<p>[list][<em>]ATAT’s are taken down by an entirely scripted event triggered by “holding down the square button” -some press article<br>
[/</em>:m][<em>]Press speculation based of closed doors footage that there is no ammo/reloading on all blasters, makes sense from a canon perspective, horrible decision from a gameplay perspective[/</em>:m]<br>
[<em>]No apparent drops from fallen soldiers[/</em>:m][/list:u]</p>
<p>Basically I get the idea that all their decisions are driven by scripted cinematics and appeasing Star Wars canon over gameplay. While the former two are usually good things, they become bad when they’re at the sacrifice of gameplay.</p>
<p>Not to mention the sheer gushing of the media hype machine has made it so blatantly obvious that EA has the entire press in their pockets. I don’t think I’ve ever seen press articles more hollowly positive about a game ever before.</p>

            <p>I swear to god if it comes with season pass and or day one dlc DICE and EA are dead to me. I also heavily fear it will be a battlefield reskin with a few additions. I gave up hope of ever getting a Star Wars Shooter as good as Battlefront II years ago.</p>

            <p>Well, I’m honestly not really bothered by those things.</p>
<p>What it looks like so far is kinda star wars battlefield, with mixed air/infantry/vehicle stuff. And BF4 shipped with, what, ten maps at launch? If there are two or three maps per planet, then we should get pretty much the same number.</p>
<p>Ten to one they add more planets in expansion packs, too.</p>
