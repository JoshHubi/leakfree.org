So much potential. Seamless land to space combat, much more fluid looking controls despite being so incomplete and broken... Just... God fucking damn it...</description>

            <p>Why does George Lucas and all of his other companies intentionally go against what his fans want?</p>
<p>Fans: Battlefront 3!</p>
<p>Lucas: How about some Force Unleashed?</p>
<p>Fans: Battlefront 3!!!</p>
<p>Lucas: Force Unleashed 2!</p>
<p>Fans: BATTLEFRONT 3!</p>
<p>Lucas: Old Republic.</p>
<p>Fans:  BATTLEFRONT 3.  But Old republic is actually kind of cool.</p>
<p>Lucas: 1313… and Kinect.</p>
<p>It just makes me really disappointed.  I think it would be really cool if the community were to make Battlefront 3.  But they’re not exactly Valve and I have a feeling that it would end in lawsuits.</p>

            <p>W-w-w-wait… Is that the highest an Xbox can take? Just kidding. Anyway, I never was a Star Wars fan and am still not and this is just Battlefield, ripped off by Lucas Arts. Did I get something wrong here? I understand the whole idea of pre-alpha stage and “Actually getting the game to work” but I have seen far better pre-alpha stages then this. There is a big leap between being able to run the game and being able to run the game with 12 fps…</p>

            <p>Yes very alpha. This needs at least a good year and a half of development to turn into something special. I really hope they go with a Republic Commando design aesthetic. The foley for that game was fantastic also.</p>

            <p>That’s early alpha stuff. If you watched it a little further you’d see that it was in pre-optimization phase, running at like 15 fps average.</p>
