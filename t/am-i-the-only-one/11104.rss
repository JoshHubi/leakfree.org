</aside>
<p>The link your showing shows an accident that was by no means covered up. Some bombs were lost, it’s happened alot believe it or not.<br>
That doesn’t equate to anything like Black Mesa. Infact if I understand you right you think the best cover up would be to say 3 nuclear bombs were accidently dropped from 3 different planes that happened to be flying over a government funded research complex, during a heavy military build up around the area after the base went mysteriously silent.</p>
<p>Wow, I completely agree with you, that is a much more sensible and less contrived idea than simply dismantling a larger bomb in a government facility partly designed to do so and setting it off underground, calling it an accident.</p>
<p>Good one.</p>
<p>Regardless though your still completely disregarding my main point of you not being able to drop a nuclear bomb on US soil without it getting out because of the sheer amount of manpower required in doing so. Whilst disregarding all our points on the base more than likely being designed to withstand aerial bombardment.</p>

<p>Lol. Calm down child.</p>
<p>This isn’t a war. This is two people trying to explain simple things to  someone who will not be proved wrong for the very simple fact of saving face ON THE INTERNET, simply because they disagree with other people liking a game they don’t.</p>
<p>Honestly if your using nuclear bombs in underground areas that are actually tunnelled out then the damage would be beyond catastrophic to anything and anyone underground. Vast areas would simply cave in within a matter of miliseconds whilst other areas would cave in under the weight of whats above. I’d imagine every major access tunnel to the underground would collapse. Any areas still left underground in one piece would be cut off.</p>

<p>So what do you guys think how big the Facility was ? I mean they had to go for a “Security-radius” to make sure everything is destroyed. So, speculating about the square kilometers of Black Mesa and the (mainly) Surface damage that a airborne nuke bomb does, don’t you think the need for “Packages” like this was great ? Like Dias said, who said it was only 1 bomb ? Even with the little warheads doing that much danger - 1MT from a warhead the size of a average human (it even looks like that in the Screenshot with GMan) - don’t you think more were necessary to be sure all is taken care off ?  I mean wasn’t that the whole purpose of the Black Ops besides eliminating Freeman, because the Grunts weren’t able to handle it all themselves ?</p>

<p>Hence why I said they should have sent black-ops instead of the soldiers to begin with. If the black-ops planted the bomb instead of sending the soldiers, they could have sent the bomb off much sooner. That would have been a significantly larger sweep than soldiers could have done on foot &amp; it wouldn’t have given nearly as much of a chance for people to escape the facility. By the time they planted the bomb in Op4, at least 2 days had passed since the incident started &amp; there were still plenty of human &amp; alien survivors not killed by the soldiers.</p>

<p>They didn’t know truly how far the containment had failed, they also didn’t know of the Nihilanth holding the rift open and sending in more aliens.<br>
They also don’t want to wipe a no doubt multibillion dollar research station holding some of the most important technology ever developed by man off the face of the earth. How do you not come up with this very simple stuff yourself?</p>

<p>So? Some would say the cold wars most desperate and tense period was during the 80’s, it didn’t finish until the early 90’s, which gives us 40 years of cold war building at the facility. Needless to say though that even the most recent areas ( which is still only 10 years of building until the cascade ) would still be hardened regardless.</p>

<p>Ok, fair enough. But what if, hear me out on this, the US government didn’t want people to know they’d just dropped a megaton yield nuclear weapon on their own soil to destroy their own research areas currently being besieged by their own military for unknown reasons? Which would no doubt happen had they done it themselves on the books. I’ve just explained this to you, but for some reason you disregard it and continue along the same line.</p>

<p>I lol’d because you have at least two people here explaining something which you’ve consistently said doesn’t make sense, picking apart endlessly simple things that can make sense if you simply put two and two together, yet are now saying your not confused by.</p>
<p>I’m bored now. We seem to be going over the same points over and over for ever more increasingly slightly different reasons whilst you dismiss any points being brought up. I enjoy talking about Half-Life lore, but this has just got tedious.</p>
<p>Your still to tell me though of when the US government has used F-16s to drop nuclear payloads. I am intrigued.</p>

<p>Hence why I said they should have sent black-ops instead of the soldiers to begin with. If the black-ops planted the bomb instead of sending the soldiers, they could have sent the bomb off much sooner. That would have been a significantly larger sweep than soldiers could have done on foot &amp; it wouldn’t have given nearly as much of a chance for people to escape the facility. By the time they planted the bomb in Op4, at least 2 days had passed since the incident started &amp; there were still plenty of human &amp; alien survivors not killed by the soldiers.</p>

<p>Your ability to compare weapons fell apart with the entire paragraph.

</aside>
<p>I compared the barnacle to the crowbar because the barnacle, like the knife &amp; pipewrench is more powerful than the crowbar, being a grappling hook goes without saying. I also didn’t compare the pipe wench &amp; tau cannon just because of the damage, but because they’re both the only weapons with charging attacks &amp; do the same damage when charged all the way, but can’t even overcharge like the Tau, it also doesn’t even cost anything to use &amp; it’s the first weapon you get in the game.

<p>Isn’t that basically what happened in the game to begin with? I mean, what I was saying was to skip the whole “panicked military build up around the area” thing &amp; go straight to the nuke &amp; claim it was an accident. I mean, if they can get <a href="https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/File:Apache_Black_Ops.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Black-Op helicopters</a>, then I don’t see why they couldn’t get a jet too.</p>

<p>This raises the point of; why weren’t the black-ops sent instead of the soldiers to being with? I mean, unless it’s because they’d then need Blacker-Black-Ops to cover them up too.</p>

            <p>I liked Opposing Force. Mostly because I am an epic HECU fan, but whatever.</p>
<p>A lot of the time though, OP4 looked like it was just pieced together to show Half-Life original areas in an almost gimmicky attempt to incite nerdgasm. I’m not a huge fan of Race X. But I liked the squad mechanics, even if they did kinda suck at following me around properly. But that’s inherent to Goldsrc.</p>

<p>My point is that adding “complexity” is not the same as adding “depth”. Or in other words; You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then say that. I know what it means thanks, but if you like…</p>
<p>I personally believe that by adding to the ‘complexity’ of the military side of the game it creates more depth within the overall story.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>My ability to compare the weapons falls apart there</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Your ability to compare weapons fell apart with the entire paragraph. You make comparisons between the barnacle and crowbar based entirely on damage, whilst completely disregarding it’s major function of being a grappling hook. Your comparison between the pipe wrench and the tau cannon based on nothing but damage is beyond strange.</p>
<p>I agree about the comparisons of the deagle and python, the sniper and crossbow, and the combat knife and crowbar. However they still have enough of a difference to keep the action fresh, and with their improvements along with the improved enemies it serves to make the action faster and to an extent more intense.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>F-16’s can &amp; have been used to drop nuclear bombs. They could easily get away with that by saying <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=507921#post507921" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">“one of the warheads they are decommissioning on the site… had accidentally gone off.”</a> Because I honestly doubt anybody would be close enough to this top-secret research facility (or the nuclear blast for that matter) to contradict the story.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You would never be able to drop a bomb from an F-16 in conjunction with a major military operation secretly. You have the people storing the ordnance, the people readying the plane, the pilots, the pilots controllers, the logistics people, the people giving the orders and every single one under them doing the same, as well as the people on the ground watching. No, you use people off the records and you equip them on site with warheads no one is going to find missing later on. Also, when has the US dropped nuclear bombs with F-16s? Also again, you’d never be able to have a nuclear bomb go off without SOMEONE knowing about it.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>And there would have been a better chance if they had simply dropped a nuke on the place from the get-go.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This just brings me to a good point already stated by Tiki. Black Mesa was built on a missile silo complex, designed to withstand aerial bombardment from both conventional and nuclear bombs. This, also in conjunction with the newer areas which are more than likely going to be designed even better to withstand such things brings to question the effectiveness of such an idea. Proof of this could well be the marines attempt at bombardment themselves. Vast areas underground are COMPLETELY untouched, the bombardment mostly serving to cover their own retreat.</p>
<p>Just look at the Lambda complex, completely untouched past the surface tunnels yet teaming with infestation down below. Assurance of complete destruction would be paramount.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>No, you’d want it to be as quick &amp; effective as possible so there’s no proof to the contrary. Keeping it low-key is pretty easy to do when the place you’re bombing is a government-funded research facility in the middle of a New Mexico desert &amp; all it’s staff was killed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So you DON’T use a massive military presence that is no doubt causing an amazing stir around the country as is. You use guys off the books.</p>
<p>You don’t send in a nuke from an F-16 with a paper trail as long as the corridors of Black Mesa. You use a warhead being decommissioned on site.</p>
<p>You DO use a NUKE, placed underground precisely because you have a facility miles across and miles deep teaming with alien infestation, that is incidentally littered with the bodies of hundreds of staff, riddled with bullets by YOUR soldiers.</p>
<p>The place is a GOVERNMENT FUNDED RESEARCH FACILITY. You don’t think someone would notice if Area 51 was wiped off the map after a panicked military build up around the area? You do realise how completely backwards that quote is?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Now you’re just pulling facts out of your ass.</p>

</aside>
<p>The only part stated as fact was that the orders went above the military, or better worded, the ‘regular’ military. That IS fact, evidence by them slaughtering US troops in order to keep the operation hush.</p>
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. People can’t put what is right in front of them together, then call BS when they get confused by it, which you’ve already admitted to.</p>
<p>Half-Life will forever be in my top 2 games of all time, probably first, and I consider OP4 not so much as a separate game but more like an extension of it. It is by far the best add-on to a game I’ve ever played and I find it strange so many Half-Life fans dismiss it over such trivial things, things I’ll add they just don’t seem to understand due to it not being slowly spelled out for them.</p>
