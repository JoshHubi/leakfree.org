    <title>Crash to desktop on player death</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-to-desktop-on-player-death/62786</link>
    <description>I&#39;m noticing a crash to desktop issue on player death during Surface Tension, and the Gonarch boss fight, no not responding errors, just instantly crashed to desktop instead of the map reloading to last checkpoint, I mentioned this to a friend and they think there&#39;s a stack misappropriation on such maps.</description>
