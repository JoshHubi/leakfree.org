    <description>So I have been trying to download the Blackmesa Source files from all of the officials mirrors but my University&#39;s internet always flags it as a virus. My university is known for having pretty draconian internet policies, I cannot use any proxies or torrents.

Do you guys have any suggestions on how I could get a hold of the necessary files?

I was contemplating studying at a Starbucks over the weekend and try and download it there but I don&#39;t know how long that would take.</description>

<p>Now it is working, I tried that before and it didn’t work. I think it is working now since I am using my university’s wireless at the library instead of at my dorm. I guess the dorm internet has stricter policies (even though they have the same name).</p>
