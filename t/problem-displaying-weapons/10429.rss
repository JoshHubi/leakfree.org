            <p>please ensure that the folder placed into “sourcemods” is named “BMS”:<br>
\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods[b]BMS</p>
<p>[/b]This can help resolve issues with game saves, subtitles, chapter  names, and possibly any other issues that may be caused by utilizing the  wrong folder name.</p>
<p>Also, do you recall which mirror you downloaded the game from? What will also be helpful would be posting your system specs including the GPU.</p>

            <p>Even am facing the same problem, I can pick weapons, but can’t see them. I can however attack, it feels like Gordon’s is a magician and fires away bullets without wielding weapons. Is there any console command to fix it?</p>
