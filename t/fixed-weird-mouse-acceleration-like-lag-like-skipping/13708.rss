    <title>[FIXED]Weird mouse acceleration-like/lag-like skipping</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixed-weird-mouse-acceleration-like-lag-like-skipping/13708</link>
    <description>So, once I started up a game i got into the intro cinematic. Then, when the train sequence commenced, I looked around a bit and then noticed that I got this very odd mouse lag. I&#39;ve tried looking up over the internet, everything I found was not helpful for me. 
I tried:
limiting fps to around 58 
m_customaccel 0, 1, 1.5 and 2
reinstalling my mouse drivers
restarting my pc
putting in these launch commands: -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd
turning v-sync and mouse smoothing on and off
lowering graphical settings
changing sensitivity
sellecting all cores except one in task menager

However, none of those &quot;fixes&quot; worked.
NOTE: during some moments, my mouse sensitivity would either raise or lower, it&#39;s pretty random. And the skipping often came when I turned right with my mouse (even though it could skip every now and then). I also think it might be a problem with raw input, however I can&#39;t enable it, there&#39;s no command for it)

GPU: AMD Sapphire R9 270X Dual-X 
CPU: AMD FX 4300 Quad-core 3.80 GHz
RAM: 2x4 GB (8GB)
Windows 8.1 64-bit operating system.

I FIXED IT: I only had to download the Patch for Windows 8.1 called KB2908279 (it&#39;s made for problems like these)</description>
