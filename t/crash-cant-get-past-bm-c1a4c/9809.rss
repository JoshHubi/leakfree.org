    <title>Crash - Can&#39;t get past bm_c1a4c</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-cant-get-past-bm-c1a4c/9809</link>
    <description>My game keeps crashing on [b]bm_c1a4c[/b], when I try to activate the fan.
It crashed to my desktop and says h2.exe has stopped working.

I have tried setting everything on low in graphics, and tried to disable SLI - doesn&#39;t work...

[b]Video:[/b] [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddzKTR1L9-g&amp;feature=plcp[/url]

Is there a way to fix this?

:meh:

[b]EDIT:[/b] Possibly a fix here: &quot;I might have found a solution to this. This worked for me at least. 
I simply went into the &quot;new game&quot; menu and selected chapter 5 and then replayed that chapter again. My game didn&#39;t crash when I turned on that fan.
It&#39;s worth a try, you will just have to rush through the chapter again.

However, this is still a bug in the mod and should be fixed...&quot;

            <p>Same problem but resolved by reloading a save from 2 minutes before. Here is a save that will make you crash after starting the fan: <a href="https://tepeserwery.pl/blackmesa/crashingsave.7z" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tepeserwery.pl/blackmesa/crashingsave.7z</a></p>

            <p>best solution i found sofar is to no-clip to the top of the shaft of the big fan and get in the airducts. from there you can continue normally</p>
<p>for those who dont know<br>
enable develepor console in advanced options under keybindings.<br>
then type into the console wich is opend with the ~ key<br>
sv_cheats 1<br>
noclip<br>
and when u are done<br>
noclip<br>
sv_cheats 0</p>
<p>dont have anything better sorry</p>
