    <title>Half Life 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-2/5840</link>
    <description>I just got a Dell laptop with Windows 7 and an Intel i3 processor (I think that’s what they call it) and every time I start a Half Life 2 game, it says that my drivers are not in the list that Valve has. It does this for EVERY Valve game that has the source engine (TF2, HL: Deathmatch, HL2, Hl2&#39;s episodes) I have uploaded the details, and HL2 is the only game that does not start right. It will start sometimes, then if i quit and get back on, it has skippiness from HELL. You can’t even choose a menu to access. The other things work fine, with a little audio trouble on Episode 2. I just want to know why HL2 does that, I don&#39;t really need details on how to fix it. If I can figure out why it does that, then I should be fine.





And for all the trouble I may have given those with my spelling errors, I apologize. It WILL NOT happen again. Thank you for your concerns and comments. 

And it isn&#39;t that I do not take my time, it is that my hands are slightly large for the keys. Therefore I often hit the letter next to the one I want, or I shorten to make my painful typing time.

 That and I don&#39;t think all my keys work.... but enough excuses. I am sure most of you don&#39;t really give a damn anyways...</description>

<p>Woah woah woah. There’s a distinct difference between fitting it in and “jamming it in”. The latter includes force, which <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> be very destructive to computers, especially laptops. I assumed that most people took the “don’t force it” approach to computer component installation, but obviously I didn’t cater enough to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>I was referring more to the capacity of the individual motherboard; it is my experience that truly incompatible types of RAM have different numbers of pins, so if you buy a piece of RAM that fits normally, then there’s no danger of overloading the motherboard. Forcing something in, of course, <span class="bbcode-i">will</span> damage the motherboard, but I assumed that, since he’s on the internet, he’s very unlikely to think that a 100 pin piece of ram is going to fit into a 200 pin slot.</p>
<p>Being cautious is one thing, but being overly melodramatic is quite another. I can’t imagine anyone buying anything without checking it first, but if you’ve got a stick or two of something lying around at home, as long as its the same size as the slot you’re forcing it into I can’t see any problem in trying it out.</p>

<p>There’s actually no real way you can “fuck it up” if you get the wrong type; it probably wont fit and even if the wrong type <span class="bbcode-i">does</span> fit, it just wont boot or wont recognise the bits that aren’t right.

<p>I was a computer technician for six years and I have to warn everybody away from following this asinine advice. Jamming the wrong ram into your motherboard even if you can get it to fit can cause major MAJOR issues. I cant even tell you how many literally melted motherboards i have been brought after some buffoon tried to do what this guy is suggesting.</p>
<p>Thinking that just because something fits it is therefor compatible is downright ignorant.</p>
<p>So to reiterate as clearly as possible  take an extra 15 minutes out of your day and google your computers model number to find out what kind of ram is compatible and get that. DO NOT JUST BUY WHATEVER FITS AND JAM IT IN!</p>
<p>-edit</p>
<p>We actually used to have some sticks of melted ram that some guy brought in hanging from the wall in our shop so that people who came in could see first hand what it looks like when people who don’t know what they are doing try to change the ram in their computers. haha</p>

<p>No, anti-aliasing is entirely dependent on your graphics card.</p>
<p>Your RAM is used to store things temporarily; things like textures, models and sounds are extracted from your hard drive and thrown into RAM so that the game can access it quickly. Having more and/or faster RAM reduces load times, helps prevent the game from stuttering and allows you to use higher detail textures.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Cool. What else can speed up my computer without having to buy a graphics card or a motherboard? I’m really sorry but I don’t know much about computers.</p>

<p>I do this all the time. Just check the motherboard info and you’ll be fine. There’s actually no real way you can “fuck it up” if you get the wrong type; it probably wont fit and even if the wrong type <span class="bbcode-i">does</span> fit, it just wont boot or wont recognise the bits that aren’t right. You probably wont be able to get a refund, however, so be sure to double check that you’re getting the right type and that you aren’t exceeding the maximum RAM storage of your computer.</p>
<p>But, as Ram said, it isn’t going to help with AA. It should help with general performance issues, especially if what you have at the moment is tiny, but anything over 2Gb is fine. (Pro tip: Without a 64-bit version of Windows you wont be able to use over 4Gb of Ram).</p>

            <p>Ok… this might not be the proper thread but at least it’s relevant.</p>
<p>I can play half-life 2 ep.2 without a problem on very high settings as long as there is no anti-aliasing. Will adding memory help me? I only have 1 gb. Having AA on will make my fps drop big time.</p>
<p>If adding will help, can you please tell me how low and high memory affects performance?</p>

<p>What maxey said. I’d upgrade to an ATI or NVIDIA card.</p>
<p>You need to research the hardware on it before buying the PoS, meaning actually do some research. Get the catalog with all the integrated hardware it has (or take down the model name of the laptop) and look it up on the net.</p>
<p>I’ve done this many’a time for my computer illiterate friends pick out a laptop. It’s as simple as taking down the model number of the card and just popping it into Google with “reviews” at the end.</p>

<p>The “awake” one is grammatically correct. There is no space between a and wake… unless you’re using some obscure dialect of English.</p>

<p>So to break through all the useless conjecture posed so far in this thread let me be the first to ask you straight out, What graphics chip does your laptop carry?</p>
