    <description>The three-giant-piston-crushers puzzle (Marked as a &quot;generator&quot;) just after the icthyosaur battle can be broken by throwing a physics object (I used a clip of crossbow bolts to first find the problem, then a barrel. Wooden object don&#39;t work, because the physics system smashes them) onto one of the crushers lower plates. It&#39;ll close on it, and won&#39;t open again.

This probably serves me (and anyone else who gets it) right, but it does [i]permanently[/i] disable the puzzle: Jammed crushers will never reopen, making a reload necessary.</description>
