<p>And you call yourself an atheist? Good going.</p>
<p>I’m done with this thread, all you did was make up some more little theories of what an atheist is, but none of you come up with a uniform theory. You even have self claimed atheists telling other self claimed atheist they’re wrong.</p>
<p>Anyway, I won’t change my opinion on atheists, you won’t change your views because I have my opinions. But as far as I’m concerned, these last few pages have shown me that my opinions about atheists are correct (and I’m well aware that each and every one of you will say that I was wrong, but hey, that’s human nature).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, let me repeat my question: why do some atheists feel justified in attacking and demeaning Christians after claiming that such behavior is exactly what they hate religious people for?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well you kind of unquoted on how it happens for me. But I did say that even though I try to ignore it when I’m told I’m going to hell for whatever reason it may be (usually in my case, having a boyfriend (Bisexual), wearing shirts with inverted crosses, pentagrams, even Pagan symbols and lettering, and even the fact I have long hair) Sometimes when these “soapbox evangelists” are out there for 3 maybe 4 days out of the week, I can lose my temper.</p>
<p>So my point being, poke and prod anyone enough and the greater chances are, they will eventually retaliate. This goes either way. I’m not really for debate when I’m walking to class and when I can be told I will suffer for my own nature 2+ times a day. It’s going to happen. The roles can be reversed and it may be the Christian, Catholic, Mormon…ect that’s the one dealing with the Godless Heathen telling them everything they believe is a lie day after day.</p>
<p>And we don’t feel justified, saying that is just putting words in my mouth. Some might, and honestly, I have no idea why they would. You can’t really single out Atheists when it’s only some that feel justified.</p>
<p>We can also throw that question back and say "Why do some Christians, Catholics, religious et al feel justified in judging others when their own Holy Book teaches lessons of ‘For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. [John 3:11]’ and ‘Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; [Luke 6<span class="bbcode-b">:</span>37]’</p>
<p>You cannot stop others from being militant in their views, all you can do is be the one who is civil and let your example lead others. I cannot answer for other Atheists just as Christians cannot judge me as if they were God.</p>

<p>I think my biggest problem with some of the atheists in this thread isn’t their opinions, but the way they act.</p>
<p>I constantly hear complaining from atheists about how they are “persecuted,” how religious people want to “convert” them, etc. etc. And yet I can’t think of one instance on this forum that I’ve seen any attempt by any Christian to convert an atheist - or even a Christian ridiculing an atheist for his beliefs. There is debate, yes, but ridicule, not so much.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You don’t fly in atheistic circles, I take it.  I’ve been compared to everything from Hitler and Stalin to the Devil himself.  I’ve been called immoral, evil, and stupid.  I’ve been called a liar.  I’ve been called untrustworthy and siding with America’s enemies.  I’ve been told that I hate religion, Christianity, and God.  I’ve been told that I should leave my homeland.  And that’s in one week.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, constantly I hear atheists ridiculing Christians and other religious groups, talking about how backwards they are, trying to get them to change their beliefs, and generally being very insulting.</p>

</aside>
<p>In this thread?  Other threads?  Where?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>It’s as if you all will jump at any chance to show just how wonderful you are…and even when it’s not on topic! I remember a post a while back regarding “morality,” where the poster felt it necessary to clarify that he didn’t mean “religious” morality - as if it made a difference!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, it does.  So-called “religious morality” is claimed to stem NOT from what is right or wrong…but from what their deity says is right and wrong…as if they are automatons following whatever their book says, whether they believe it or not, whether they agree with it or not…and this “religious morality” is used in the most immoral acts imaginable.  But, it’s okay, because their deity says to do it, or something.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you exhibit so much of the behavior that you claim to abhor?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because of this:<br>
<img src="../../uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f0984456f8dd47c5beb0a68b72c3d6cf62ef2aa.jpg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="6I6PuuEmauXO02up6hgyYXrei26" width="300" height="300"></p>
<p>:brow: :what: <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/ragec164.png?v=9" title=":rage:" class="emoji" alt=":rage:"></p>
<p>But the bigger issue is, every other subject has much more strident, much more abhorrent behavior attributed to the criticism thereof, but the moment you criticize an argument used in the course of defending religion, you’re said to be “Bashing Religion”.  And, frankly, I’m tired of it.  We’ve had to put up with this crap for thousands of years.  So, I do apologize if I say something that might be insulting.  It’s FAR less than atheists have had to put up with over the years.</p>
<p>EDIT: By the way, before you dismiss the editorial with a handwave, let me tell you this:  Atheists see letters like this and then see tacit acceptance from the Christian community.  They see Christians approving of this abhorrent behavior.  This kind of thing should be akin to asking black people to move to the back of the bus.  There should be a groundswell from the Christian community against this type of thing.  But, none is ever shown.  I’m sure you’ll respond with something like “She’s not representative of all Christians”…I’m sorry, but when this kind of thing goes unanswered, it’s viewed as kind of representative of Christians.</p>

<p>Many people on this planet who really loathe the United States would absolutely LOVE to see atheists kicked out of America, because then the US would lose the majority of their best scientists, and other nations would welcome them with open arms, rapidly gaining technological advantage over the US, while the American Nation would fall behind farther and farther. Of course it is not as simple as that - and a deeply religious nation with such a strong military becoming dependant on other nations resources can only lead to one grim future full of war (as seen in today`s news), so we can only hope that the percentage of atheists in America will gradually increase, until it gains influence on foreign policy, making the US a far more peaceful country than ever.</p>

<p>I’ve been compared to everything from Hitler and Stalin to the Devil himself.  I’ve been called immoral, evil, and stupid.  I’ve been called a liar.

<p>Holy shit, that sucks dude.</p>
<p>I basically grew up in an area where almost everyone was either a)deist b) agnostic or c) atheist.</p>
<p>It was basically the accepted thing to not really go to church or talk about blasphemous things and of course as young teens we would all snigger about it, but later it grew more serious. I suddenly found that almost no one <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> believed in god, which was funny because almost everybody pretended that they did.</p>
<p>Now almost everyone my age +/- 10 years (some older) is a proud non-believer and I wonder about the future. If almost everyone I know is secular, how much longer can religion survive?</p>
<p>And <span class="bbcode-i">then</span> I discovered the fundies. :retard:</p>
<p>The point of this whole response though is that I have never been insulted for my (lack of a) belief system.</p>
<p>people might say “shh, you shouldn’t say that!” or “hey, that might offend someone!”, but its almost exclusively out of concern for others, not themselves.</p>

<p>I know some of them are well-meaning; that they are scared for me (“The most important thing you can do in your life right now is to ask to be saved”), however, how do you tell an otherwise-kindly old lady that I used to work with there is no Voldemort killing muggles and that she shouldn’t be scared for me?  I simply don’t tell them anything and try to avoid the subject at all.</p>
<p>Even here in Seattle, I sometimes dread the subject of religion coming up in my workplace.  Especially when people start talking about what church they’re going to.  I clam up.  I always fear that they’ll ask me which church I go to, which, then, I’ll have to say that I’m an atheist…which might cause a confrontation with people I otherwise love working with.</p>
<p>Online, however, I have a certain amount of anonymity so I am able to speak more freely, and am allowed to express my disgust and anger over my feeling that I have to keep mum that I don’t believe.</p>

          <p>My parents were heavily catholic. My Atheism troubled them greatly, and led to a lot of conflict. Unfortunately, I’m not a personal that is all that high on morals, so a lot of my actions got attributed to me not believing in ‘da holy fader’ according to my grandpa. I admit that IF I was catholic, I would use it as an excuse to be a total dick.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Forget the girlfriends birthday? It okay, she’s a Protestant. haha!</p>
<p>In all seriousness though when my parents were around they used to attribute everything I did they disagreed with to my godless beliefs. If they were alive to know I have a child out of wedlock who isn’t baptized I think they would kill themselves. Haha.</p>

          <p>I was once invited to a roleplaying group (Dark Eye pen &amp; paper fantasy) who met at a local Christian student dormitory complex.</p>
<p>I don’t know what came over me, but when I was in the front hall, which was kind of a lobby with a person occupying a desk and supposedly keeping watch over who entered and who left, I seriously asked whether or not it was okay for me as an Atheist to enter.</p>
<p>The lady looked a bit confused first, but then smiled heartily and said: “Really, that’s not a problem. Everybody is welcome here as a guest, regardless of belief. Our policy is just that only Catholics can rent a room, so they can live among one another in this building. That’s all. Have a nice day!”</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised. Her welcoming me had felt genuine and not in the least faked. I wonder if the same could have happened to me in Bavaria. Or the USA.</p>

<p>You didn’t really quantify the question you asked though. You didn’t restrict the question to them. I thought it was a bit of an offensive jump to make. I don’t support the hostile environment, but when talking about morality, it is always important to note context. Religious ( hopefully more specified than religious in context ) morality can be vastly different than specific society morality. Amish morality versus much of their surrounding societies morality. It’s always important when discussing the slippery morality discussions.</p>

<p>I suppose I thought that the question quantified itself. By asking, “Why do atheists feel justified in doing this,” it seems that it kind of requires them to do it to feel justified in it.<br>
With all due respect, let’s look at your reaction itself. I make what we could call a poorly worded comment about atheists, and like five people immediately take offense due to grouping people together. And yet…</p>

<p>No, but your hate of that person would still influence your actions towards that person in some way, eh? Unless you had a good reason to, you certainly wouldn’t treat that person like someone you loved, no?<br>
Every action is caused by a reason - and that reason is generally a belief. Every belief doesn’t lead to every action, but every action is caused by a belief, be it the simplest thing like opening a door because one believes that one can’t walk through solid matter, to something much more complex, like not killing someone because one believes that murder is wrong. Not to say that these are the SOLE motivators in these situations, but they’re there nonetheless.</p>

<p>'s understandable, but does it make the situation better or worse? My point here is that, when atheists attack Christians like they are, they’re not proving anything or lending any credibility to their beliefs - all they’re doing is dragging themselves down into the same pit that Christians who attack others have put themselves into.</p>
<p>It seems as if some atheists - those who I’m referring to - seem more concerned with attacking religion than with anything else. It’s as if they claim that they’re atheists solely so that they can attack religion. You want to talk about being “holier-than-thou,” there it is, right there.</p>

<p>What? Religious morality and secular morality both come from a source - for a religious person, it’s his god, for a secular person, it’s nature (as in, natural rights.) Both are equally immutable…<br>
I’m not sure I understand your “automatons” comment. If someone’s following something that they don’t believe is right, it’s not the fault of the thing they’re following that they’re in the wrong, as what justification do they have to follow it if they believe it’s wrong? If I am following a car and I see it drive off a cliff and think, “Wow, I shouldn’t do that,” is it the first driver’s fault that I went against what I thought and drove off the cliff anyways?</p>
<p>This doesn’t matter, though, because my point was that this particular situation didn’t warrant a clarification. It didn’t mean what the source of his morality was - but he clarified it anyways.</p>

<p>EDIT: By the way, before you dismiss the editorial with a handwave, let me tell you this:  Atheists see letters like this and then see tacit acceptance from the Christian community.  They see Christians approving of this abhorrent behavior.  This kind of thing should be akin to asking black people to move to the back of the bus.  There should be a groundswell from the Christian community against this type of thing.  But, none is ever shown.  I’m sure you’ll respond with something like “She’s not representative of all Christians”…I’m sorry, but when this kind of thing goes unanswered, it’s viewed as kind of representative of Christians.</p>

<p>I think you’ll find that plenty of Christians criticize people like this, or those Westborough Baptist Church people. I’m with you, that I’d like to see a bigger backlash - but then again, I’d also like to see a backlash in the atheist community regarding the militant types.</p>
<p>The best, it seems, that most of you have been able to offer is that “they do it too.” And I’m sorry, but that isn’t good enough - not when you criticize them for behaving the way you yourselves are behaving.</p>

<p>'s understandable, but does it make the situation better or worse? My point here is that, when atheists attack Christians like they are, they’re not proving anything or lending any credibility to their beliefs - all they’re doing is dragging themselves down into the same pit that Christians who attack others have put themselves into.</p>

<p>I agree, that is why I do not side with them, but that doesn’t make me any less of an Atheist.</p>

<p>It seems as if some atheists - those who I’m referring to - seem more concerned with attacking religion than with anything else. It’s as if they claim that they’re atheists solely so that they can attack religion. You want to talk about being “holier-than-thou,” there it is, right there.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, I won’t defend these people.

Neither are justified.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not defending them either, I am only one person, I have told you why I can sometimes lash out out of temper and I hope you can see my reasons why, a reason why. But a reason to lost temper is not a justification.</p>
<p>And there might possibly be a reason you find more Atheists arguing their point, is because you disagree with it and it sticks with you. Same goes for the other side, as I and many people see ourselves as the minority on the internet and in the public.</p>

<p>No, but your hate of that person would still influence your actions towards that person in some way, eh? Unless you had a good reason to, you certainly wouldn’t treat that person like someone you loved, no?<br>
Every action is caused by a reason - and that reason is generally a belief. Every belief doesn’t lead to every action, but every action is caused by a belief, be it the simplest thing like opening a door because one believes that one can’t walk through solid matter, to something much more complex, like not killing someone because one believes that murder is wrong. Not to say that these are the SOLE motivators in these situations, but they’re there nonetheless.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We are getting a little lose with the term belief here. I guess you could say I get up and walk because I believe I can/should, but that starts to become a little bit beyond the scope of what I was referencing. Also, I can be perfectly pleasant to people I hate. Often because I understand that it might not be justified or appropriate. I’ve learned to actually like people who I initially didn’t like in this way. I admit I’m pretty good at masking my true thoughts to someone about that someone. But I don’t think I’m special, or the best ever.</p>

          <p>I’m a mix between Athiest and Agnostic. I would say I’m a true Athiest, I only disbelieve the unprovable.<br>
I am more then willing to believe but I will not believe until I recieve PROOF! Nor do I understand anyone who chooses to be a slave to their religion, religion is a personal choice, having others dictate your faith to you just doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Religion was invented to explain the unexplainable and to keep the masses under control. If god did exist then why would he allow faith on his name be exploited by the ruling classes?</p>
<p>My only opinion on God existing is fi he does he looks at us like ants. He looks down on us and says “oh that’s neat” or “how did they do that” I don’t see how any higher being could exist and provide ZERO measureable proof in recent years… or in 2000 years come to think of it, hell the bible wasn’t even written during the events, it was written years later. Would you believe a criminal at a trial said “I couldn’t have killed that person because I was in the Swiss Alps skiing, here’s a book I wrote yesturday saying so.”</p>
<p>Blind belief isn’t just faith, it can also be stupidity. If I said I was a multi-milionaire would you believe me without proof?</p>
<p>That’s all I’m saying</p>
