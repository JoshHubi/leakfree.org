    <description>I have played black mesa but was disappointed to see that Magnusson was not by his casserole that you can mess up. Is there any way that he will be added in the final version so that his mention of it in HL2 Episode 2 will be reflected upon in the game?</description>

            <p>Im pretty sure, it was meant that magnusson ordered some other scientist to make his casserole as the scientist standing in the room in HL1 was not retconnect to Magnusson in EP2</p>

            <p>The joke in Episode Two is that you finally learn whose casserole that was.  It would be different if Magnusson was standing right there when you did it.</p>
<p>Of course… if he was… he would have verbally berated you and probably marched you over to his office so he could yell at you some more, making you miss your appointment in the Test Chamberrr and therefore prevent the Resonance Cascade from ever happening, saving the world.</p>
<p>So really, this whole thing is Magnusson’s fault.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Magnusson was not by his casserole in the original game so he’s not in Black Mesa.  They did provide a reference to him, though.</p>
