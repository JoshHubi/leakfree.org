<p>For example, it plays Metro 2033 with all of the settings maxed, DX11 and 1600*900 very well.</p>

            <p>I just bought an <a href="https://goo.gl/QAvvy" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HD 7770</a> and it’s done me pretty good. For example, it plays Metro 2033 with all of the settings maxed, DX11 and 1600*900 very well.</p>
<p>Do you usually play demanding games at high resolutions?</p>

Looks like a Radeon 7770 or a 650 Ti are your best bets, unless you can get that 570, which ought to be a little better. Zotac is generally well rated on newegg, though I don’t know much about them personally (how well they honor rebates, quality of customer support, etc.).</p>
