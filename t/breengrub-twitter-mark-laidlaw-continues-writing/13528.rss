([i]Did I really spell his name incorrectly? Jeese...

I already knew how to spell his name and I still accidentally spelled it with a &quot;k&quot;.[/i])



[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]Marc Laidlaw certainly got bored.

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]This is old news for some!

This seems to be story that [i]could be[/i] if Doctor Breen survived as a copy or series of degenerating copies as a host-body in which he calls himself a Shu&#39;ulathoi. This is a Vortigaunt term that the Combine Advisors cannot comprehend. As a matter of fact, it sounds like the Vortegese language was created to defy and confuse the Combine and anyone else. My theory is that G-Man may possibly be one of these agents who works for the minds that generate thoughts of worlds...literally just imagined worlds. I think he works for them. Honestly...this is leading to some kind of God-type beings who design worlds and galaxies etc.

I searched throughout this forum topic but couldn&#39;t find a thread like this but I know I am certainly late on posting it. Hopefully this thread stirs some thought; however, it is not likely, at least to me, that these snippets of hobby writing will end up in the storyline of Half-Life. It could possibly serve as inspiration for future installments.. It [i]does[/i] allow for a deep backstory and tie-in for the Shu&#39;ulathoi in the story though.</description>

<p>Honestly, I just said that because he started posting two years ago. It’s great to know that Marc Laidlaw has his mind in Half-Life territory!</p>

<p>I think he already said that this isn’t related to the game in any way. Remember, he’s responsible for the story so these tweets are just additions to the story. I suppose in that way it is related but his tweets have nothing to do with HL3 besides being related to the Half Life lore. I suppose it’s still interesting though.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, and on that note I am removing the term “Half-Life 3” because it will only come off as a way to garner attention or act like some kind of excuse to simply bring the term up. Having been a player of Half-Life 2 since 2004, I’m not about that.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, why would Marc Laidlaw write leisurely about Breen in a host body for a whole year? Actually, it was over two years starting May 2012 and ending in July of this year. It was either to warm up his writing ability for the next installment, or he is going to draw heavily from the ideas on that Twitter page. Valve and Laidlaw are cryptic.</p>
