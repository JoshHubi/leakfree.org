    <title>Improvement for Surface Tension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/improvement-for-surface-tension/14742</link>
    <description>This is a small suggestion for an improvement on something that&#39;s darn-near perfect already. In Surface Tension, I got to the tower in the reservoir and opened the drains. In real life I would never have dared dive into the drain turbulence, however. This is for two reasons:
1.  An active drain usually shows a convexity on the surface, not a lot of mysterious turbulence.
1. I had already visited the drains and seen there was a grate blocking them; in RW I would have expected to be slammed into the grate and held there by pressure of exiting water, there to drown where my bones would never be found.
So if somebody is interested in improving on perfection, I would suggest you fix the water surface above the drains so it looks like what it is, and show a door instead of a grate at the bottom of the drain channel so I won&#39;t be afraid to go in there.

            <p>Didn’t find any problems with this level, especially did not find it ‘long and boring’ (how is it even long? You swim down to the pipe and you get sucked through in seconds to the other side)<br>
But hey, more spray particles and stuff would be cool.</p>
<p>Edit: Could actually add displays in that dam control tower with messages relating to its suction power or something, saying it’s damaged, at 50% its normal power, error etc. Would make more sense for freeman to get through the pipe undamaged (because otherwise I would think he would just get absolutely pulverised at full speed).</p>

<p>I am thinking that it is necessary all the same to make the flow of water at the bottom of the dam to the player to throw away. Because to go through this channel is very long and boring.And judging by this old photo  river bottom  is lower than in the game<br>

            <p>You need to add water funnels like in real life<br>
.<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0213e3c512c8fad9454f0864d15065d6b3c86b65.jpeg" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/0213e3c512c8fad9454f0864d15065d6b3c86b65" title="YeniseiRiverShipping-2440.jpg"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0213e3c512c8fad9454f0864d15065d6b3c86b65.jpeg" alt="YeniseiRiverShipping-2440.jpg" data-base62-sha1="inzffb4YDW45ZrGmB8E6JfoOHz" width="690" height="500" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/0213e3c512c8fad9454f0864d15065d6b3c86b65_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">YeniseiRiverShipping-2440.jpg</span><span class="informations">800×600 196 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
You also need to add an effect to trap the water because the water a lot of flies from a great height. Here are the photos from the dam of my city<img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/9/94d238066ceb6b9c17a05a9e6291dc5732070d0e.jpeg" alt="400px-Krasnoyarsk_hydroelectric_station.jpg" data-base62-sha1="lex3yLsSa50otoY4ozmiSSz0MP4" width="400" height="300"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0b490cac64aa3913d044b307aee3fe7ca68ac46b.jpeg" alt="0_9bd72_d83bd267_L.jpg" data-base62-sha1="1BPL7vJySh3r23ME4nUxPC9K3QD" width="500" height="318"><br>
In addition, will be much better if the players will carry the water almost to the pipe, because to go from dam to the pipe is very long and boring</p>

            <p>If you thought Surface Tension was “darn near perfect already” (appreciate the praise by the way, thank you very much!), wait till you see the upcoming Surface Tension update, where we have updated some aspects of the existing maps, ESPECIALLY GRAPHICALLY, redone portions of the B map, updated visuals on the E map, polished up gameplay, fixed bugs, and added in the missingUncut maps!</p>
