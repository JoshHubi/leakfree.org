    <title>minor issue - we&#39;ve got hostiles chapter</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/minor-issue-weve-got-hostiles-chapter/11433</link>
    <description>Hi,
I started playing black mesa yesterday. During the we&#39;ve got hostiles chapter, I knocked a turret over with a grenade and it managed to get stuck in a blast door that closed on it. Using the button to open the door didn&#39;t work and I couldn&#39;t dislodge the turret with the crowbar either, meaning I couldn&#39;t progress further into the level as the way was blocked.
I also took damage when I touched the blast door.

wasn&#39;t a major issue for me as I had a quick save not far behind that point so I just repeated the area carefully knocking the turrets over :stuck_out_tongue: .

Just thought you should be made aware</description>
