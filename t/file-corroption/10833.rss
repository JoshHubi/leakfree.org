    <title>File Corroption</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/file-corroption/10833</link>
    <description>I have tried over 20GB of Black Mesa download attempts from the provided mirrors inc two attempts via torrent - ALL coming up with a file corruption error. This is officially driving me mad now. I&#39;m not a newbie when it comes to downloads but this is crazy!

&quot;CRC failed in BlackMesa.7z. The file is corrupt&quot;

Please Please Please anyone got any suggestions as to how to get an uncorrupted file downloaded? Many thanks</description>

            <p>Few things to try…</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you try a “verify local data” or “force recheck” for the torrent after download? (it should re-download corrupted chunks and fix it.)</li>
<li>Are you using the installer, 7zip or WinRAR? (you might get this kind of error if you are using old/incompatible decompressor versions. the file is might not be corrupted, just use the installer.)</li>
<li>You might want to add an ip filter/blacklist to your torrent client (to minimize torrent poisoning - then re-download from scratch.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
