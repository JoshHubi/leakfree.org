    <title>Donating to soundtrack without paypal memebership</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/donating-to-soundtrack-without-paypal-memebership/10376</link>
    <description>Hi!

I&#39;d very much like to donate to the soundtrack, but when I chose the no-paypal option and choose my country (Denmark) it transform into a paypal registration form instead of a &quot;guest&quot; form. Is that a bug or a scheme from paypal to get new clients?

Is there another way of donating? - since I&#39;m not at all interested in making a paypal account!

And I just want to say Great work guys!!!</description>
