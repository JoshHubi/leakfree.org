Reported From AP Wednesday 2/29/2012
BARCELONA , Spain — Microsoft on Wednesday let consumers start trying out its upcoming touch-based Windows 8 operating system, which aims to power a new wave of computer tablets and traditional PCs designed to counter Apple&#39;s big gains in the market through its Macs and iPads.

The test &quot;beta&quot; version of the revamped system was introduced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the planet&#39;s largest cell phone trade show, and borrows some of the look of Microsoft&#39;s Windows Phone 7 software for Windows 8.

Windows 8 doesn&#39;t have the traditional &quot;Start&quot; menu, and applications are spread across a mosaic of tiles in a design Microsoft calls &quot;Metro&quot; — seen as an attempt by the company as a scramble to preserve its market share. And executives said it powers up on PCs in eight seconds, much faster than the previous version.

            <p>I was going to try it out, but since it’s mostly designed for the touch interface, with the old style there for keyboard and mouse, it may be a bit pointless for me.</p>
