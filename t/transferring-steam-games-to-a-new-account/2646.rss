    <title>Transferring Steam Games to a new account.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/transferring-steam-games-to-a-new-account/2646</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had many problems recently with all of my games, and I have tried loads of things, such as re-installing games, re-installing steam, etc, and also trying on different computers, but the problems in game persist. I won&#39;t go through what the problems are again, but I can say they piss me off.

Although, I will actually say some of the problems, In HL2: Episodes 1 and 2, Gmod, HL1, HL1[noparse]:BS[/noparse] and HL1:OF, everything is killed in one hit, may not be serious, but it annoys me. And other problems include not starting, going through loading screen and freezing. The freezing happens about 75% of the time.

I have tried on almost 4 computers now, and the problems are still there, I have done all the &quot;Defragment Game Files&quot; and whatever the other one is called, and I believe it&#39;s down to my account. Whatever&#39;s gone wrong, it&#39;s retarded.

So, I have asked Steam Support, but they can&#39;t think of what the problem is, and everytime I mention if I can move games to another account, they close the question.

So, do any of you know how to do this?
Any of solutions would be helpful as well.

Thanks guys. :3</description>

<p>You mentioned that the problems you are having happen on 4 different computers.  Are all of these computers <span class="bbcode-b">your </span>computers or are they neighbors, your friends across the street/across the town/across the city?  It is rather rare to get the same issues on other people’s computers so I am curious if you tried your games on someone else’s computer.</p>
<p>You are describing several issues so you may need to consider that there are a couple things going on.</p>
<p>The freezing may be:<br>
\ your computer specs (not enough memory/poor graphics card)<br>
\ poor or sloppy installation or corrupt installation<br>
\ your ISP may be capping you? or if you are on cable, there are more folks sucking bandwith?<br>
\ other?</p>
<p>The one hit wonder behavior may be:<br>
\ poor or sloppy installation or corrupt installation<br>
\ config files somewhere are messed up<br>
\ Other?</p>
<p>I am most likely wrong, but in a case like this, if it were me I would suggest completely uninstalling steam and the games.  Not just deleting everything in the steam directory except for the steamapps folder, (like some folks suggest) but uninstalling completely.  (It means you would loose all your games and will have to re download them, but if they aren’t working in the first place, why would you wanna save them?)  Then checking your registry to ensure steam is deleted out of there as well.</p>
<p>Once done, use CCleaner to clean your registry real quick. (I LOVE this program!)</p>
<p>Then install from scratch and see if that changed anything.</p>
<p>OH… and what are your computer specs?  Have you run a DXDiag to check that all systems are a go?</p>
<p>EDIT: and before I forget, do you have a <a href="https://www.cheathappens.com/show_download.asp?ID=21101" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">“Trainer”</a> installed?  A trainer would allow you to have a “One hit” capability.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The computers I have tried it on are: My own, my dads, and my friends.<br>
My specs aren’t perfect, but the games worked fine a while ago, don’t know why it decided to do this.</p>
<p>And I don’t use trainers, haven’t done for any steam games anyway, I’ll try CCleaner when I get my new HDD.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
[noparse]<br>
My specs:</p>
<p>Processor: AMD Turion 64 X2 Mobile Technology TL-56 ~1.8GHz<br>
Memory: 2048MB (2GB)[/noparse] RAM<br>
Display: ATI Radeon Xpress 1150.</p>
<p>Although, I’ll wait until I get my new computer, which will be in June or so, and then I’ll let you know from then on.</p>
<p>Thanks Catz.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And thanks everyone else.</p>

<p>I will laugh so very hard if steam locks your account because the person who buys it tries to register it and steam support finds out what you did.</p>

            <p>Why would moving games to another account solve your problems? Besides, you can’t do it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve had many problems recently with all of my games, and I have tried loads of things, such as re-installing games, re-installing steam, etc, and also trying on different computers, but the problems in game persist. I won’t go through what the problems are again, but I can say they piss me off.</p>
<p>Although, I will actually say some of the problems, In HL2: Episodes 1 and 2, Gmod, HL1, HL1[noparse]:BS[/noparse] and HL1:OF, everything is killed in one hit, may not be serious, but it annoys me. And other problems include not starting, going through loading screen and freezing. The freezing happens about 75% of the time.</p>
<p>I have tried on almost 4 computers now, and the problems are still there, I have done all the “Defragment Game Files” and whatever the other one is called, and I believe it’s down to my account. Whatever’s gone wrong, it’s retarded.</p>
<p>So, I have asked Steam Support, but they can’t think of what the problem is, and everytime I mention if I can move games to another account, they close the question.</p>
<p>So, do any of you know how to do this?<br>
Any of solutions would be helpful as well.</p>
<p>Thanks guys. :3</p>
