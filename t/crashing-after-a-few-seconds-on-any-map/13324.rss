    <title>Crashing after a few seconds on any map</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crashing-after-a-few-seconds-on-any-map/13324</link>
    <description>This crash is really strange.
The game crashes after a few seconds whenever I load any map. The first time it crashed, I was on the second FAF map so I thought that was normal. However, when I loaded AM, it crashed after a few seconds. I don&#39;t think its a problem related to specs because I was able to play any map before almost crash-free.
EDIT: I fixed my problem. I think it somehow may have been related to some launch options I used for HL2.</description>
