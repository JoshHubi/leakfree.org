    <title>Multiplayer Skin Models Have No Eyes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multiplayer-skin-models-have-no-eyes/13826</link>
    <description>Just bought the steam early access version of Black Mesa and I noticed that the multiplayer skins that have customize able faces have no eyes, don&#39;t know if that happens in game, but it seemed odd. This supposed to be like that or is this a glitch in the customizer?</description>
