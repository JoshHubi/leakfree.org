    <title>Your Opinion on This Creepy Find</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/your-opinion-on-this-creepy-find/6507</link>
    <description>I was browsing on the 2K Forums, and found this thread.

[url]https://forums.2kgames.com/showthread.php?104248-This-is-too-creepy...-(BioShock-related)(2k-is-this-your-doing-)&amp;p=1343955#post1343955[/url]

For those of you too lazy to click, it reads:
[QUOTE=Fhtagn]
This is too creepy... (BioShock related)(2k, is this your doing?) 
Found this while surfing Reddit: 
[url]https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/fhzzc/five_years_ago_my_parisian_aunt_asked_me_to_help/[/url]

While staying with their aunt in Paris, the Redditor in question helped her take down the wallpaper of her apartment. This is what they found beneath it:
[url]https://i.imgur.com/JZqm3.jpg[/url]

The translation, from the Reddit thread:
&quot;One day, my dear child, you will understand. You&#39;ll know that I would have wished to see you grow up. You&#39;ll understand how your mother&#39;s savagery ruined me.&quot;
&quot;My beautiful daughter.... (something about happiness)... and me, who actually believed your mother loved me.&quot;
&quot;(something) I&#39;m incredibly tired I want to... I want to sleep and... (something) my beautiful daughter. You must (something) this life.&quot;
&quot;Your mother has no idea what she really is.&quot;
&quot;You were wonderful, I was so deeply happy. Despite everything, I still love you. Goodbye.&quot;

The previous tenant was an assumed political cartoonist who mysteriously disappeared one day.
Update: Apparently he was a/the founder of the Cetravim, which became the National Institute for Professional Diving.

Edit:
Further translation. (Care of bachtaf.)

&quot;... et la belle fille que j&#39;aimais, aux fêtes de la Madeleine. Tu étais merveilleuse. j&#39;étais heureux, profondément. Je t&#39;aime malgré tout. ADIEU&quot;
and the beautiful girl I loved, at the Madeleine Parties. You were wonderful. I was deeply happy. I love you despite everything. Farewell

Below :

&quot;Dorine, voici ton père au boulot, sale boulot, eh oui mon enfant. La vie en a voulu ainsi pour moi, je n&#39;ai pas droit au bonheur tant espéré, moi qui croyait que ta mère m&#39;aimait&quot;
Dorine : here is your father at work, crappy job, yes my child. Life as decided that it would be this way for me, i am not entitled to the happiness I was looking forward to, I who thought that your mother loved me.

Top Right :
&quot;Un jour tu comprendras mon cher enfant que j&#39;aurai pu te voir grandir et que le comportement sauvage de ta mère m&#39;en a empêché. Dire que j&#39;ai crée Getravim pour être un jour à la maison tous les soirs, mais ta mère n&#39;a pas saisi la subtilité du jeu. Je m&#39;en vais, je ne sais pas où, mais je te promet de tout mon coeur de venir te voir très souvent (si les Vignolles le veulent bien !!!)&quot;
One day you will understand, my dear child, that I could have watch you grow old, and that the savage behaviour of your mother prevented me to do so. And to think that I created Getravim so that one day i could be home every night, but your mother didn&#39;t understand the subtility of the game. I leave, I don&#39;t know where, but I promise with all my heart that I will come to see you very often (If the Vignolles agree with that !!)

Bottom Right :

Mon enfant, je n&#39;ai plus le moral et je ne trouve plus la force de lutter avec ta mère car je l&#39;ai beaucoup trop aimé

&quot;My child, I no longer have the moral, and I no longer find the strength to fight your mother because i have loved her so much.&quot;

Bottom left : &quot;j&#39;éprouve une grande fatigue et j&#39;ai envie de bien dormir. Peut-être qu&#39;ainsi je resterai toujours près de toi, mon enfant chéri. Il faut que tu comprennes qu&#39;il devient nécessaire pour moi d&#39;arrêter cette union ou ta mère n&#39;a aucun sens et vie telle qu&#39;elle est. Dorine je t&#39;aime&quot;

I feel really tired and want to sleep well. Maybe this way I will always remain close to you, my dear child. You have to understand that stoping this relationship has become necessary for me, because your mother is insane and lives the way she is. Dorine I love you

Edit (February 09, 2011; 3:46 PM):
Another portion of the wall: [url]https://i.imgur.com/VXk7C.jpg[/url]

&quot;You don&#39;t have the right. You stole our child. God will see to it that you pay for this one day.&quot;

Doing some research the folks on Reddit found that it was CETRAVIM rather than GETRAVIM, which was apparently a diving school. The photograph below is supposedly related.
[url]https://i.imgur.com/uYkBP.jpg[/url]

UPDATE (February 09, 2011; 3:52 PM):
Someone has sent an inquiry to Gerard Loridon to see if he has any information relevant to the situation.

Edit (February 09, 2011; 4:04 PM): A clarification. The message on the wall may have been there since the early 70s hidden under that wallpaper. Details are slow to filter in. 
[/QUOTE]
I seriously doubt that 2K had something to do with this. What do you guys think this is? Do you think it&#39;s legit? A complicated ARG? A hoax? What?</description>

            <p>That’s not even a coincidence, because it would imply that the two events share similarities or links. And they don’t.</p>
<p>It’s just the writings of a cartoon artist who was very very sad.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">edit: This thread reminds me of when some dude thought District 9 shared similarities with Half-Life. I mean, what the fuck. Some of you guys need to get the fuck away from your computers for a bit.</span></p>

<p>Top Right :<br>
“Un jour tu comprendras mon cher enfant que j’aurai pu te voir grandir et que le comportement sauvage de ta mère m’en a empêché. Dire que j’ai crée Getravim pour être un jour à la maison tous les soirs, mais ta mère n’a pas saisi la subtilité du jeu. Je m’en vais, je ne sais pas où, mais je te promet de tout mon coeur de venir te voir très souvent (si les Vignolles le veulent bien !!!)”<br>
One day you will understand, my dear child, that I could have watch you grow old, and that the savage behaviour of your mother prevented me to do so. And to think that I created Getravim so that one day i could be home every night, but your mother didn’t understand the subtility of the game. I leave, I don’t know where, but I promise with all my heart that I will come to see you very often (If the Vignolles agree with that !!)</p>
<p>Bottom Right :</p>
<p>Mon enfant, je n’ai plus le moral et je ne trouve plus la force de lutter avec ta mère car je l’ai beaucoup trop aimé</p>
<p>“My child, I no longer have the moral, and I no longer find the strength to fight your mother because i have loved her so much.”</p>
<p>Bottom left : “j’éprouve une grande fatigue et j’ai envie de bien dormir. Peut-être qu’ainsi je resterai toujours près de toi, mon enfant chéri. Il faut que tu comprennes qu’il devient nécessaire pour moi d’arrêter cette union ou ta mère n’a aucun sens et vie telle qu’elle est. Dorine je t’aime”</p>
<p>I feel really tired and want to sleep well. Maybe this way I will always remain close to you, my dear child. You have to understand that stoping this relationship has become necessary for me, because your mother is insane and lives the way she is. Dorine I love you</p>

<p>“You don’t have the right. You stole our child. God will see to it that you pay for this one day.”</p>
<p>Doing some research the folks on Reddit found that it was CETRAVIM rather than GETRAVIM, which was apparently a diving school. The photograph below is supposedly related.<br>

<p>UPDATE (February 09, 2011; 3:52 PM):<br>
Someone has sent an inquiry to Gerard Loridon to see if he has any information relevant to the situation.</p>
<p>Edit (February 09, 2011; 4:04 PM): A clarification. The message on the wall may have been there since the early 70s hidden under that wallpaper. Details are slow to filter in.</p>

<p>I seriously doubt that 2K had something to do with this. What do you guys think this is? Do you think it’s legit? A complicated ARG? A hoax? What?</p>
