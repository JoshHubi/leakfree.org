    <title>Interesting occurences involving dreams</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/interesting-occurences-involving-dreams/3403</link>
    <description>First one.  Couple days ago I was eating some chicken late at night, I was pretty worried it might have been undercooked.  Ate it anyway, figure if I got sick whatever, it tasted good.

Anyways the next morning my mom called me asking if I was ok, she said she had a dream I came to her in the middle of the night clutching my stomach and feeling ill.

Second one. When I was 8 or 9 I had a dream I went to my church to see a magic show.  Saw the whole thing in my dream, all his tricks, it was like I was really there.

The next day I find out I&#39;m going to a magic show at my church that weekend.  Get there, it is EXACTLY the same as the dream.  Everything he did, the spot I was sitting, everything was the same.  I knew what he was going to do before he started.  Blew my mind at the time, it&#39;s still fucking crazy to think about.

I also have this weird dream involving a massive grey space, think the white room in The Matrix where they go to get guns.  Off to my side a bit is this large cube of particles all swirling around, it looks like TV static.  They are all black and white.  Then way off in the distance my dad is standing there and a stream of these particles are flowing out of the cube towards my dad.  

I get the &#39;feeling&#39; of the number one million during this dream.  Also everything feels incredibly detached, it&#39;s one of the hardest feelings to describe.  It&#39;s like I&#39;m in my body but out of it at the same time, everything feels incredibly distant and detached.  I get this feeling when I&#39;m awake now and then, don&#39;t know what triggers it.  It&#39;s very sudden and doesn&#39;t usually last long.

It&#39;s really odd and I&#39;ve been having this dream repeatedly since I was a little kid.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live up to the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.”<br>
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.<br>
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.<br>
I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color if their skin but by the content of their character.<br>
I have a dream today.<br>
I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.<br>
I have a dream today.<br>
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.</p>
<p>Oh wait, that was someone else wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Now that I think about it, jizz in a dream actually happened to me too, except I could clearly remember that I was fapping in the dream, but not moving at all IRL, still same result though, I wish I had the power to do that when awake. INSTA JIZZ GO!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s actually possible to train yourself for that achievement. Just take your time for erotic daydreaming and concentrate on the most erotic things you can think of, without ever touching yourself. The more you develop and delve into your sexual fantasies and imagination, the hotter the mere thought of it can get you, until you manage to give yourself an orgasm by merely daydreaming, as said before - without touching yourself.</p>
<p>It takes much more time, of course, than simply fapping to porn.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Well congratulations, sounds like you won the game. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Most of my dreams seem to have gray cloudy skies in them too, except for the good ones. The really good ones have clear skies, like the one where I was wandering in a field and I found a baby seat, which I sat in, and which started floating and then flew really fast. That was the most fun dream I’ve had, closest to the so-called “flying dreams”.</p>
<p>Also, and I just remembered this so I’m not sure what it is, but when talking about symbolism in dreams and the types of dreams you have, isn’t there supposed to be a category of life-altering dreams or something? Dreams that like really mean something to you and change your outlook or whatever. I’ve never had one, has anyone else?</p>
<p>Also also, does anyone lucid dream? I don’t think I’ve ever really been able to do it before, but I’ve known people who have said they could do it and it sounds awesome.</p>

            <p>I dreamed that I was dead but when I woke up I was still alive.</p>
<p>Seriously though, when I was a kid, as early as I could remember, I was ALWAYS having that kind of creepy dream, I was in a strange world made of infinite metal beams, like a sky scraper skeleton, with grey clouds everywhere and nothing at all going on, I kept wandering around aimlessly, thinking about life. Sometimes I thought to myself, “where am I going?” I told myself I’m just looking for the elevator, I’ve heard about people who had the same dream twice, I’ve heard about people who had the same dream over and over, but my dreams were all different, just  roughly in the same location. You won’t belive it, that shit went on for at least 10 years, but after a while when I was about 15, I felt I was getting close to the elevator, I could smell it. One day found the son of a bitch, it was nothing special, cramped so that only I could fit, also made of metal, I remember pushing a red button and hearing the slight hum of the motorized elevator going down.</p>
<p>After that day, I never had those dreams, ever again.</p>
