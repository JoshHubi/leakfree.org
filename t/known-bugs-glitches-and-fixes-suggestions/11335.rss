    <title>Known bugs, glitches and fixes + suggestions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/known-bugs-glitches-and-fixes-suggestions/11335</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, 
I downloaded Black Mesa: Source a week ago and I have to say the developers did a really goodjob on recreating the original title. I played this game three times I still can&#39;t get enough it, I absolutely love this mod. However, I encountered numerous of bugs and glitches in the game. On the first play I did notice some bugs like crashing, stuttering, low frames, ect... But in the second play through, I did some &#39;Nitpicking&#39; and notice some more bugs. Some are very minor but some are sort of major types and needs fixing. I did some searching through the community forums for any fixes that people created and I searched through the web too. Here is a list of bugs I encountered, they&#39;re categorized in major to minor bugs. I also placed fixes for some of these issues. These fixes may work but aren&#39;t 100% guaranteed. Credits go to whoever created the fixes.

-[b][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]Low Frames, Stuttering and Freezing[/SIZE][/b]
I&#39;m not a computer enthusiast, I have a sort of mainstream PC. But I have noticed across the forums people have been complaining about this problem, even with an expensive computer.

This fix is for quad cores or more! If you do not have a quad core or more then I don&#39;t recommend to use this fix:

-[b][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]Game crashes[/SIZE][/b]
I get random crashes if I play the game too long, for example: From Blast Pit to Surface Tension, I would crash somewhere there.
-[b][COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]Fixes?[/b]
None

-[b][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]A.I ignores you[/SIZE][/b]
Especially when you get to the Hydro Dam, there is a group of soldiers walking towards the Dam, if you kill one at the front they keep walking. I also noticed the A.I ignores each other too, the part where the Gargantua bursts through the door in the tunnel, there are two soldiers next to the door and the Gargantua just ignores them. Possibly scripted to kill you first?
-[b][COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]Fixes?[/b]
None

-[b][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]Particle effects cause FPS drops[/SIZE][/b]
The smoke effect form the damaged Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the concrete dust and the turret muzzle flash or smoke effect causes some FPS drops.
-[b][COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]Fixes?[/b]
This reduces the smoke effect in the Test Chamber:

In the chapter On a rail, after parking the train on the elevator with the turrets, the elevator won&#39;t go up. I couldn&#39;t reverse on the train either. I had to walk on foot to the next train.

The ladders are very glitchy at the moment, it&#39;s hard to get off of them and going up and down.

I don&#39;t know about some of you guys, but I thought Black Mesa was a little too hard and unbalanced, especially when you verse the Apache on the cliff side.

I don&#39;t really remember in the original, but if you deploy Snarks at aliens, they attack them. But in Black Mesa they don&#39;t go for the aliens anymore and I find this weapon useless. I don&#39;t know if this is a feature or a bug.

In Half-Life 2: Episode 2, the Vortigaunt would have a combat stance if being attacked, the Black Mesa one would just stand normally in an idle position. I also wondered if there is more sounds for the alien slave? Because all I&#39;m hearing is like: &quot;Lunnnngggggg&quot; &quot;Tuuuuurrrrrrrr&quot;. It would be awesome if there were more sounds.

-[b][COLOR=&#39;Yellow&#39;]HECU idle sounds[/SIZE][/b]
I didn&#39;t really like the HECU idle sounds, they say, &quot;I&#39;m tired of playing games&quot; or &quot;Do it&quot;. I was thinking of like radio chatter or something like in Half-Life 1.

Found it kinda unrealistic how a 50. cal would blow a person up. Wouldn&#39;t it make a huge hole through a person?






Okay, this is what I encountered. I think I missed some bugs but I probably got most of them. Hope these fixes I found work  :slight_smile: 

And BTW if you found some more bugs and fixes, feel free to post here.

Credits go to the people who created the fixes.

If there is some grammatical errors here, then I&#39;m sorry. Not everyone&#39;s first language is English.</description>
