            <p>I’d be rather worried about the state of my PC than about not being able to play the game really TBH in case I would had been getting loading times like yours while seeing that there are next to none people in the entire world having the same issue. I hate to give this last resort type of advice but you could try:<br>
a) reinstalling Windows (as a method to get rid of malware/e.t.c. and to have latest drivers installed);<br>
b) try getting another HDD and GFX card and check if that helps remedy the issue;</p>
<p>These are not the real ways to handle the problem but the alternative is to bring your PC to a servicing company for a paid support service.</p>

<p>TBH nobody have an idea concerning what’s wrong with BM on your PC thus you get no replies here. Knowing that you’re the same guy who has extremely long loading issues with BM - I’d bet you have to figure out what is causing them at a first place and most probably it would auto-magically heal this one issue as well.</p>
