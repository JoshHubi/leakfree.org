<p>Yes show me where all the valuable objects in your house are placed. :3</p>
<p>BTW did you make sure that your PC has the correct time and date set up? Make sure it’s at least the right date and time zone (in Windows).</p>
<p>If it still doesn’t work try deleting clientregistry.blob in the Steam folder.</p>

            <p>No no, it hasn’t. Trust me. It doesn’t say anything like “Wrong password” or some shit like that. I do remember me being able to log in one time, but when I would start a game, it would say “Steam servers too busy trollololol”. So I restarted ny PC and again it won’t even let me log in. Reinstalled and everything.</p>

            <p>I think your steam account has been stolen, FFFUUU. you’re saying that you’ve been unable to log into steam for the last five days, yet the board’s steam card application says you last logged on eighteen hours ago. Go to the support page and create a ticket saying that you believe your steam account has been stolen <em>this part is Very fucking important, so pay attention</em> include in the report 1) the account’s login name (separate from what people see in-game) 2) the last three games added to the account 3) credit card information from credit cards used to purchase games on steam and 4) any changes made to the account thereafter.<br>
You might also want to include names of individuals who “promised” you admin powers on their servers (I was tricked by the bastard too)</p>
