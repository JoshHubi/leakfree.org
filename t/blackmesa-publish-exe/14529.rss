    <description>(X-posted from [url]https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/458604254427168583/[/url] )

I seem to have broke my workshop submission.

Could someone elaborate on how this tool works? Specifically, what the &quot;User Generated Content Folder Path&quot; is supposed to be? I tried pointing it to a folder where I have a /maps subfolder containing the .bsp and /graphs, then I hit Apply Changes to UGC. It seemed to compile a VPK and upload it, but when I go to subscribe and get my content, BM registers that I have it, but it can&#39;t find the .bsp. I relaunch the tool and find that the UGC Content Folder path has changed itself to D:\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\362890\449141574.

Am I correct that this tool generates the VPK automatically? I see no option to upload an individual file, only point to a folder. Since I apparently have it wrong, what should this folder be and how should it be set up relative to Black Mesa&#39;s folders?</description>

            <p>For the missing sound bug, type snd_restart in the console after starting black mesa.</p>
<p>It seems to fix it.</p>
<p>So for custom maps, use a point_clientcommand Command snd_restart<br>
with a logic_auto OnMapSpawn</p>

            <p>For what it’s worth, I just launched the game today to play for a bit - same issue again, both the shotgun and MP5 were invisible. This time, though, all it took was restarting the game to get them to appear again.</p>
<p>Maybe content isn’t getting mounted properly when the game launches…? I dunno.</p>

<p>Yeah, there seems to be something very strange going on there. Like I told Crypt on the Workshop itself, I actually went and deleted <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> the UGC-related folders for BM I could find - the steamapps one, the addons folder in /bms/ itself, everything - as well as unsubbing to all the Workshop addons I had, then subbed to the HD sleeves. In-game, both the SPAS-12 and MP5 didn’t render. I can’t remember exactly what I did, but after a bit of fiddling around, the SPAS-12 started rendering again, but the MP5 just… wouldn’t. Resubbing to it again seems to have fixed it.</p>
<p>All I can think of is that something’s not getting downloaded properly from the Workshop, but I have no idea.</p>

<p>I did ask about our view arm model rig. “It’s janky as hell” is basically the gist of what I was told. I will bring it up with the appropriate teams and see if it’s something we can fix, and see when we’ll be able to (we’re busy!)</p>

<p>These two things are probably related, do you have any mods installed Ilopn? Crypt, I’m not 100% sure if it’s the mod fault, or if it’s the mods fault because we’ve messed something up. I’ll ask around.</p>

            <p>Sorry to bump this thread, but I seemed to be having a different problem here.</p>
<p>One of my submission is having the problem of not being rendered properly. (The Muzzleflash could be seen on the shooting animation)<br>
And the shooting sound are heard, but somehow the sounds in which I needed to change with my submission couldn’t be played.</p>
<p>I tried moving it outside of the .vpk, and it still have the same problem.</p>
<p>This is the error report regarding the sound modification.</p>
<p>Cannot figure out which search path sound\weapons\mp5\reload.wav came from.  Absolute path is d:\steam\steamapps\workshop\content\362890\563270266\sound\weapons\mp5\reload.wav<br>
Cannot figure out which search path sound\weapons\mp5\reload.wav came from.  Absolute path is d:\steam\steamapps\workshop\content\362890\563270266\sound\weapons\mp5\reload.wav<br>
Failed to load sound “)weapons\mp5\reload.wav”, file probably missing from disk/repository<br>

<p>And somehow, blackmesa_publish.exe didn’t want to work.<br>
I tried double clicking it, but it doesn’t want to show up.<br>
I checked the task manager, and it shows 3 different blackmesa_publish.exe is running, but no window is being shown.<br>
I even tried to end the process, but it didn’t want to end it.</p>
<p>Is there somewhere where I have to do something?<br>
Did I miss a memo?</p>

            <p>It is possible that those files may be on a list that you can’t replace. The CC files aren’t working at the moment with menu’s, so that may be connected.</p>

<p>These files have to be replaced due to the fact that the font supplied in the game does not support the Cyrillic layout.</p>
<p>It can not be that the addon refuses to work because of the fact that I’m trying to replace these files?</p>

            <p>I’m working on Russian localization and began work on the location of files in the workshop.</p>
<p>I am trying to load the interface localization and subtitles, through p2map_publish.exe and blacmesa_publish.exe, packed in VPK, and unpacked. No subtitles are not a menu translation is not working.</p>

            <p>Okay, so I have Bravado in the Workshop set up as you describe now.  It’s the individual files, not a VPK, laid out in /maps (along with /mapsrc for the VMF and a TXT read me).  For me, Steam is placing them in SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890/449141574.  So, we have:</p>
<p>SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890/449141574/maps/bm_bravado.bsp (and the .ain in /graphs)<br>
SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890/449141574/mapsrc/bm_bravado.vmf<br>
SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890/449141574/readme.txt</p>
<p>However, Black Mesa is not finding the map to load.  Get a generic “map not found” error when you try to do “map bm_bravado.”</p>

            <p>It would be now. So it would be SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890/449141574/&lt;maps/materials/models/etc&gt; folder.</p>
<p>If you want, you can upload it, send it to me, and I can check.</p>

            <p>Okay so, what you’re saying is that if I have the uncompressed, non-VPK files in their own folder, such as:<br>
SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890/449141574/bm_bravado/ (even though 449141574 should be a unique folder for the mod already?)</p>
<p>Then the game should be able to read it, if not now, then in the next update?  Because it doesn’t read it in this one.  The console can’t find the map.</p>

            <p>Alright, so I had a chat with the programmer. He’s currently working on something else at the moment, and won’t be able to get things fixed up for a few weeks at the earliest.</p>
<p>Until then, I’m here to help get you guys set up with workarounds. At the moment, it is possible to safely upload mods with blackmesa_publish.exe and to distribute them via the workshop. I’ll list the issues that we know of now, and then the stuff that works.</p>
<p>Clarification:</p>
<ul>
<li>All mods will now download to the SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890 folder. This is now how Steam wants everyone to do it, and so here we are having to us it.</li>
<li>Uncompressed mods will NOT be compressed into a .vpk. I am unsure if this is intended behavior, but as it stands, it’s a thing that makes it possible to use the workshop. (More on that after the dramatic plottwist)</li>
<li>Any mods uploaded on the old uploader, will need to be uploaded again. Sorry about that.</li>
</ul>
<p>The broken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thumbnail uploading, you’re supposed to do it via the publish tool. It was left out during development of the tool due to some miscommunication/misunderstandings. This is something that you can’t change via the workshop page. It’s kind of silly, in my opinion. I’ll see if I can get in contact with a Valve employee who’s working on the workshop stuff and see if I can figure out why it is the way it is.</li>
<li>If you’re on the public beta branch of the game and click “Workshop addons” on the main menu, it will not do anything. This was the UI issue I mentioned earlier, Maki. I misunderstood what the programmer said, so I conveyed the wrong info. My apologies.</li>
<li>If you upload a multiplayer map, it doesn’t show up under the Host Online Game &gt; Maps list (see below for additional information about uploaded mods).</li>
<li>Blackmesa_publish.exe - it can get all jumbled when you’re uploading/clicking on things. This is known. I was able to restore its look just by resizing the publishers window.</li>
<li>If you use a .vpk for your mod, it will not be recognized by the game. We’re not sure why this is, but it is how it is right now. This is something that we’ll be working on fixing soon. To reiterate: <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">mods that use .vpk’s WILL NOT WORK.</span></span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b"></span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b"></span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">HOWEVER THE NOT BROKEN… <em>PLOTTWIST!</em> … DUH DUH DUUUUUUUUH</span></span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b"></span></span><br>
If you upload a mod that isn’t using a .vpk; that is, it’s uncompressed and just of the file structure: MyModsName/maps (and/or materials and/or models and/or scripts)  it will be accurately and correctly read by the game. Your mod will be downloaded and recognized by those who subscribe to your mod. Players CAN use your mod, if you upload it uncompressed. Again: DO NOT TURN YOUR MOD INTO A .VPK AT THE PRESENT MOMENT.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, tl;dr: Upload your mod normally, don’t make it a .vpk, mods will work fine.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please DO NOT HESITATE TO ASK… It’s rough right now, but it works. We will be working on getting fixes out as we can. I’m here to help you all (the modders of black mesa) get answers to what you need and help make the tools something that works for your.</p>
<p>Thanks for bearing with us. I’m pretty stoked to see what everyone comes up with. Again, if you’re making a mod, please do not hesitate to share it! Post it on the forums, tweet it to <span class="mention">@BlackMesaDevs</span>, facebook us it… Hell, send a carrier Pidgeon with a link to it. If I see mods, I will look at them and there’s a very good chance that I’ll have it shared on twitter or facebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>:s nark:</li>
</ul>
<p>… PS: We need a snark emote.</p>
