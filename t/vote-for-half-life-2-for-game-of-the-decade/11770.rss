            <p>Gabe was probably wondering how long this is going to last. People are still voting for HL2 in ever greater numbers due in part to its story line being so awesome but also because they can’t wait for HL3, which should be the best game of this decade (if they make it before 2020).</p>
<p>This win bought them a little more time to work on HL3, since people are obviously not tired of voting for their current games.</p>

<p>Bioshock is good but highly overrated. The setting, the art deco style architecture, and the overall atmosphere are peerless. But there’s really only four enemies in the whole damn game (Splicers, Big Daddies, sentry guns, and copterbots. That’s really about it.), and the plot twist is basically a repeat of System Shock 2. If you haven’t played SS2 it’s a great twist. If you have, or read about it (and people mention it a ton so it’s likely it’s been spoiled, but I won’t do it here) then you see it coming a mile away.</p>
<p>And then there’s that FUCKING escort mission at the end with the Little Sisters. The only escort mission I’ve ever enjoyed was Half Life 2: Episode One. That’s really about it. Plus the moral choice system’s multiple endings was obviously a last minute shoehorn by the publishers to add another bullet point to the back of the box. All in all, it’s a worthwhile game but after the first ten hours it can get incredibly dull.</p>

<p>One very minor thing that really bugged me was the lack of art for the outside areas. No matter what window you look out, it’s always the same boring windows stretching down into a bottomless blue abyss, even if the building you’re in is theoretically supposed to be on the ocean floor. Really ruined the whole underwater city setting for me.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I don’t like such games as Bioshock, Fallout etc.<br>
-too much looting, looting and looting<br>
-gameplay gets repetitive and boring fast<br>
-psychological stories… mindfuc*<br>
-not much do to once you beat the games, oh wait… there is: the same as before, Just not fun for me “_”<br>
With an only possible exception of Borderlands thanks to the humor.</p>
<p>The only reason for why I would touch Mass Effect is that Miranda chick, but the amount of dialogue is repulsive.<br>
Most games of this gen are overrated anyway.</p>
<p>But to stay on topic, I disagree with the list:<br>
-Legend of Zelda? Come on…<br>
-Half-Life 2? Well okay, I can read (of the decade) but too bad HL1 didn’t get made a bit later as I don’t see any noticeable “innovations” genre-wise from HL2 (curse Water Hazard)<br>
-World of Warcraft? I can’t comment on this without bias, some say it’s a copy-paste from many other MMO before and also that story elements are taken from other stuff… dunno if true, but ironically, the majority of mmos are trying to copy WoW (unsuccessfully of course)<br>
-Shadow of Colossus? What did it bring? Large-scale boss fights perhaps and an interesting narrative…<br>
-Wii Sports - no comment<br>
-Bioshock? facepalm… I have spent many hours into the game only to realize that it was a waste of time and no one will return those precious hours back. Bioshock 3 on another note looks interesting.<br>
-Portal, no disagreements.<br>
-Mass Effect 2… We’ll bang okay?<br>
-Red Dead Redemption brought slow-time and and auto-lock shooting. Oh wait, it didn’t.<br>
-Batman, a good game after all.</p>

            <p>^ I don’t disagree with your statement (them being over-rated), but that doesn’t mean they aren’t good games.</p>
