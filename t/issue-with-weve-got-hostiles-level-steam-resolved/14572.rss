    <description>Hi

My issue regards the entirety of the level. I cannot load any savegames I make in this level, I also cannot start the level from the &quot;new game&quot; option even though it&#39;s unlocked.

I have replayed from a save in &quot;office complex&quot; and the issue persists. Savegame screenshots are blacked out in the savegame list. Screenshot below.</description>

            <p>Seems the issue was not with the level, rather with the remaining disk space on the partition where Black Mesa places its savegames.</p>
