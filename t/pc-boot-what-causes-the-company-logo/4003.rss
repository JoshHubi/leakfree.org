    <title>Pc boot what causes the company logo?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pc-boot-what-causes-the-company-logo/4003</link>
    <description>I suppose this can belong here, hence technology. 

The thought crossed my mind, what is it that causes the company logo when you switch on your pc? for example at the moment i own a dell studio xps 8100 and when i switch it on the first screen has dells logo and bios settings down the bottom. this happens with all other like HP etc. why does this appear, is it the motherboard within the system? or the OS that comes standard with it? :retard:

Thanks.</description>

            <p>…Yeah, along with boot messages that generally go as follows, in ALL seriousness.</p>
<p>“blahthing1 found.  We hope…”<br>
“blahthing2 found.  We hope…”<br>
“blahthing3 found.”<br>
“blahthing3 confirmed.”<br>
“blahthing1 found.  For real this time!”<br>
“blahthing2 does not exist.  Continuing, pray this doesn’t cause a problem…”</p>

            <p>I’m familiar with Dell’s XPS 8000 series. I’m on one now. It’s around $800-$1200 USD, which is probably still fairly expensive for you as well. You could’ve gotten the same/better processor, bigger hard drive, more RAM, better video card for less money without going to Dell in the first place. The only reason I have one is because my parents bought it for me for Christmas.</p>

<p>yeah the only reason im doing this is because dells return policy for what i have done could well charge me over £100 for a refund of my computer.</p>
<p>although its not to bad;<br>
i5 750<br>
640gb x 2 7200’s Western Digitals<br>
6.1gb of ram 1333mhz (possibly china cheap havent inspected yet)<br>
graphics card is crap but i was planning on a 5770 series anyway<br>
plus like mcaffe (wouldve gone avg if i didnt have this) over £40’s worth of protection aswell, including everything i got, it COULDVE been worst.</p>

<p>so for example if i removed my Dell mother board and chucked this one in : <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002N2Z0KI/ref=ord_cart_shr?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A1AUCPBF2P18HS" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002N2Z0KI/ref=ord_cart_shr?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A1AUCPBF2P18HS</a></p>
<p>id most likely have something along the lines of that, Intel etc. this also include that fact my motherboard is shit, and wish a new one with a new case and psu to replace what i have atm.</p>

            <p>I suppose this can belong here, hence technology.</p>
<p>The thought crossed my mind, what is it that causes the company logo when you switch on your pc? for example at the moment i own a dell studio xps 8100 and when i switch it on the first screen has dells logo and bios settings down the bottom. this happens with all other like HP etc. why does this appear, is it the motherboard within the system? or the OS that comes standard with it? :retard:</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
