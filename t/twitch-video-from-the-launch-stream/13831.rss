    <description>Hey everyone,

What an amazing launch day! Thank you everyone for your incredible love and support. We did a launch stream yesterday where we interviewed a bunch of developers and talked about some details for Xen, Multiplayer, the future of Black Mesa, the changes from the retail version compared to the mod release, the new voice for the HECU, and many other things which will interest both Black Mesa and Half-Life fans. We also played MP.

You can watch a [url=&#39;https://www.twitch.tv/blackmesagame/b/656436441&#39;]replay of the stream here[/url].

In the barrel were (in order of appearance):
* [b]Joe Radak aka Fr0z3nR[/b] - Multiplayer level designer (Lambdabunker) and host
* [b]Chon Kemp aka Text FAMGUY1 (ME!) [/b]- Multiplayer level designer, co-host and community manager
* [b]Chris Horn aka Stormseeker[/b] - Lead level designer and Xen lead
* [b]Michael Tsarouhas aka Mikee [/b]- Voice actor and new voice of the HECU
* [b]Kevin Sisk aka Debeerguy007 [/b]- Voice actor and voice of the guards, overall renaissance man, beer ower, and all around cool guy
* [b]Adam Engels aka Adam-Bomb[/b] - Lead artist
We are planning on making these streams a regular thing, and another means through which we can engage with the fans, give progress updates and plans, and just have a bit of fun too. This is a learning process for us too, so please feel free to provide feedback and comments in this thread.</description>
