    <title>I need a new MMO &amp; RPG</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-need-a-new-mmo-rpg/8645</link>
    <description>Alright guys, I have been kinda bored lately and I&#39;ve been looking for a new MMO to play, I&#39;ve been playing DCUO for a long time and it&#39;s awesome and all, but I should refrain myself from overkilling the game. So I&#39;d like to find a new MMO
Requirements:
Free 2 Play(This is a biggie, but I&#39;ll look at it if it&#39;s not)
Fanbase is somewhat medium to large
At least ok graphics(I&#39;m not really picky, but It should at least be PS2 quality)
Fun
Somewhat special(something that makes it stand out from the masses of bad free2play mmo&#39;s)
Any Genre

I also want to find a new RPG to play, I have been disturbed by the lack of good RPG&#39;s recently, XIII was bad, and I&#39;ve totally stopped playing Final Fantasy. I used to be a FF fan and I loved all of them up to XI(Online), XII didn&#39;t use the right combat system and it was terrible, the story may have been good, but the gameplay was bad. 

Requirements:
Good story
Likeable Chars
Preferably Turn-Based(But if you can find a awesome real-time RPG then go for it)
Lots of overworld exploring( well exploring in general)
Lots of weapons to collect.
Secret/ Ultimate bosses and weapons(Like the Weapons(bosses) in FFVII and VIII)
Fun
GFX don&#39;t matter at all.( I went back to do a replay of FFVII recently and the gfx grew on me and they still are pretty good.)

And as a thank you...

            <p>Thanks  Bob, doesn’t sound worth the $40 it costs but that’s a pity about the second, I’ve played it on the 360 and it was good but I’m not a fan of the 360 and I don’t have one commonly available so it looks like Fable the lost chapters will suffice for now along with skyrim!</p>

            <p>Not really.  If you want a game like Fable 3 that is any good, get Fable 2.  All the hate on Fable 2 comes from it being different than Fable 1.  It’s a good game in it’s own right, it’s just not Fable 1.  Fable 3 is a watered down version of Fable 2 with Pokemon-esque rare weapons. (something like 51 of them, you only get a few and it’s random)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Fable 2 isn’t on PC, and I’m assuming you don’t have a 360.</p>

            <p>What really needs to happen with Xenogears is finishing up the second disc’s content. There was easily 30+ hours cut from the second disc due to the budget getting diverted to FFVIII, so a remake of Xenogears should add all that content back in. I’d be content with just having all the original art assets and content, as long as the game is finally finished. An HD remake with all new assets would be amazing, though.</p>

Mass Effect series<br>

Deus Ex 1 - 3<br>

Firefall<br>
Guild Wars 2<br>
Xenoblade Chronicles(I’ll wait for my bro to visit with his wii to play it.)<br>

<p>Yeah, I love that game I have 2 accounts. One flys a Hulk and the other an Orca. Both accounts pay for themselvs, but recently both of them went down because I couldn’t get online. I had an old gfx card that stopped being supported, and I recently got a new one. I’m gonna wait a while before I go back in though, I lost some of my social life from that game lol.</p>

<p>YES! Someone other than me played Xenogears!</p>
<p>tldr: Get Persona 4. Now. You won’t be sorry.</p>

<p>Gonna go get it now.</p>
<p>Also, I was considering making some sort of Xenogears remake, or an HD .ver. The only problem I can see with that is Square getting mad at me and making me stop or them taking it from me entirely and reselling it. I wouldn’t mind the later, just as long as everyone gets to experience this great game again or for their first time.</p>

<p>YES! Someone other than me played Xenogears!</p>
<p>Anyway, good RPGs… Have you tried a Persona title? I’d go with Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4. You get a lot of game for your money and it’s got a surprisingly solid story and well developed characters. Plus, if you get a new copy off Amazon you can get it with a soundtrack CD which is awesome. So yeah, go crazy. Persona 3 is good too, but 4 plays much better and has much more in the way of visually unique dungeons. Tartarus in 3 changes up over time but it gets tiring to play after a while. (I mean, can you <span class="bbcode-i">imagine</span> a 240+ floor dungeon? Yeah, that’s Tartarus.)</p>
<p>tldr: Get Persona 4. Now. You won’t be sorry.</p>

<p>I would also recommend fallout 1-3 and NV, especially Fallout 1 and 2 since the story is good in both, player choice is a huge part of the game, and the combat is turn based.</p>

            <p>Deus Ex 1? It’s an FPS/RPG type of game. If you like twists and turns in your storylines, this game is it. Plus, it had a badass protagonist.<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
If that doesn’t scream badass, nothing will.</p>

            <p>Have you played Diablo II? If you haven’t you can probably find its battlechest at Wal-Mart with the Lord of Destruction Expansion pack. It has a MP component, but it does have spambots though.</p>

            <p>I remember I first tried to play FF7 from my sisters copy, but the first disc was scratched to hell so I couldn’t even play it for almost a year (we didn’t get a new one, but all of a sudden it started working) Now I have the PC version with no cd patches, makes it a lot easier.</p>
<p>You could always try the older TES games if you haven’t already too, and Final Fantasy Tactics is good, as well as the vandal hearts series, Legend of Legaia, and I hear Lunar silver star story is good but I never played that.</p>

            <p>You could lose your social life to any MMO, WoW is just the most popular right now.  10 years ago, people were joking about EverQuest, and in 10 years, people will probably be joking about Titan. (or whatever dethrones WoW)</p>

            <p>I’d recommend Xenogears as I hear that’s supposed to be an extremely good ps1 era RPG by Squaresoft.</p>
<p>For MMO’s can’t really help you but if you want something different I’d recommend Asheron’s Call as it’s very different from almost every MMO out there - but you need to pay 9.99$ a month and it has slightly below PS2 era graphics so that’s a no go for you.</p>
<p>You could always try the free trial if you want to see it, but it’s hard to get into without asking for help when you play.</p>
<p>Also, not really a “new” RPG but if you have the PC version of FF7 there are some mods that dramatically change the gameplay and make it much harder, and add a ton of new enemies and bosses with the original graphics style and quality (unless you get some gfx mods)</p>

            <p>Yeah Xenoblade Chronicles has been given rave reviews even by people who are normally pretty cynical. It’s supposed to be a real game-changer for JRPGs. I don’t even have a Wii and I might just pick one up for this game, the reception has just been phenomenal.</p>
<p>As for me, I’d recommend Tales of Symphonia. It’s one of my favorite JRPGs. But the thing is, once you’ve played one Tales game you’ve kinda played them all, so I might just be biased towards this particular one cause that’s the one I played first. However Symphonia in particular does have a bit of a cult following, and it was the only Tales game to get a direct sequel, mediocre though it was, so I feel pretty safe saying it’s the best one.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger also if you haven’t played it, don’t think I need to say more about it.</p>
<p>The Mass Effect series, Elder Scrolls series, and Deus Ex 1 + 3 are great Western RPGs.</p>
<p>As for MMOs…well, I just gotta say that most F2P MMO’s are junk. Even the ones that start out pretty good usually end up being pay-to-win games with focus on their cash shops. Especially the Asian ones. That said, I had a lot of fun with Global Agenda for a while. It’s a F2P third person shooter MMO. It has a pretty good amount of PVE content now, but its main focus is still on PVP and raids. You really do benefit if you buy the one time premium account as it gives you a lot more exp, and after that if you want to level even faster you can buy a time-based exp booster.</p>
<p>Also, the reason Aion has that polish is that it was originally a subscription based MMO, but went F2P later, as did Everquest and LOTRO, so you can check those out too if you want a big-name game. WoW is also F2P up to 20, but seeing as how it’s kind of the mold for almost every other MMO it might not interest you.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a class="mention" href="/u/surplus">@surplus</a>, yeah I’ve been having a lot of trouble with Dolphin’s audio too. Twilight Princess’s audio keeps crashing when using HLE, and Timesplitters 2 will now and then play its entire catalog of sounds in a row sometimes. Tried Tales of Symphonia, and with HLE the sound kept cutting in and out. But LLE is just too frickin slow to use. I hope somebody figures out a way to improve it soon.</p>
