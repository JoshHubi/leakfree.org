    <title>Best Difficulty For HL1?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/best-difficulty-for-hl1/8907</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve played Half-Life many times before.  But the farthest I&#39;ve gotten is about halfway through Surface tension on easy difficulty.  Which is the beset recommended difficulty setting?  My health stays pretty high on easy but I&#39;ve seen many videos on medium and hard and I always see the same thing: Up until about On a Rail, there seems (in my opinion anyway) a decent curve in the difficulty.  No matter what video I&#39;m watching though, Xen always seems to be brutal on the person playing.  Ammo always runs out quickly, they die many times, and there&#39;s loads of frustration.  So which one is really [i]the[/i] best?  And how much of a difference does the difficulty have on Xen?  Is it really [i]that[/i] bad?  Or is there some easier way that only people who&#39;ve played that part of the game a few times know?  I&#39;m certainly not an HL noob, I know the entire plot front to back and even some of the beta story lines.  But I simply haven&#39;t beat any of the GoldSrc ones.</description>

            <p>I played through Half-Life so many times, that even hard difficulty is not challanging to me (that’s why I did the 1hp madness). Yet, I still enjoy the game, because having fun is only partly depends on the difficulty.</p>

            <p>Agreeing with the Majority of the others.<br>
Yeah, I play Hard the First Time through.<br>
And Yes, some of the events or fights are infuriating and drawn-out.<br>
And Yes, It takes a lot longer usually to complete a game on it’s hardest setting.</p>
<p>But that’s the thing, time. It takes you longer to complete due to the increased difficulty. You buy a Video Game, you want to get your worth, and you want to have fun. On It’s Hardest difficulty, as a first run through, it challenges you to think creatively, it takes longer to push through puzzles and fights, and the best part is that none of it is expected beforehand or dulled down because you’ve played it at an easier Mode Prior.</p>

<p>Of course, but personally I find that if it’s too difficult i get frustrated. I like a game being hard enough that I’m always right at death’s door, but easy enough so that I can feel like a bad ass.</p>

            <p>My favorite difficulty is Normal, but I’m itching to replay Half-Life 1 on Hard. I played a vanilla Half-Life 1 mod and I wasn’t doing very good, I imagine it’s because I haven’t been playing the Half-Life games a lot recently.</p>

            <p>I play Half-Life on medium, though I’m considering bumping up the difficulty as I always get through with 100hp, 100Hev, and near-full ammo. (Excluding the final boss where I just fire everything.)</p>
<p>I dunno, is the game really that good on hard? Those marines are a BITCH to fight on medium.</p>
<p>How do you people manage to get past groups of marines on hard?</p>

            <p>The only thing that ever frustrated me out of my mind in Hard was the damn controllers – and occasionally marines pissed me off. Other than that, it’s fun, but you have to save a lot.</p>

            <p>I haven’t read all of these posts ,whilst still submitting my opinion.</p>
<p>I would imagine any Half-Life believer (hahaha) who ends up playing the game starting from any difficulty level. Would end up playing up to the hardest difficulty just for shits and giggles. Or maybe I’m just obsessed… Sad … And I’m a bit out of my head.</p>
