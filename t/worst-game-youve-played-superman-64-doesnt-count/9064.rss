<p>Yes. Crash 2 and 3 were much better, it was actually possible to jump through a line of crates without dying 100 times.</p>

<p>Halo:ODST, It’s not “that” bad, but in relation to all the other Halo games it’s the worst. They had such a good idea, but it was executed very poorly. The only thing good to come out of it was Firefight and they messed that up by not including matchmaking. I also would have liked to see some PvP Multiplayer. The campaign was the worst out of the series, I hate games where 99% of it is flashbacks, it’s just so boring. I could understand if the flashbacks helped me solve some big important puzzle, but just ends up telling a story that I could have lived without.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/dotard">@Dotard</a>: While I’ll just agree to disagree on most of your post, since going back and forth on opinions will get silly very quickly, I did want to respond to a few points:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Dotard">
<div class="title">

<li>While unnecessary, what’s wrong with a well-endowed female warrior?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I wasn’t terribly bothered by Kaileena, but her sidekick, whatever her name was, was just gratuitous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really hated how Kaileena has changed in a matter of few days (in-game) to something almost unrecognizable.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Same happened to the Prince, at least in the CG cutscenes. I’ll agree that was pretty bad.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Dotard">

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>IMO the “personality redo” was justified and believable, as the Prince got mentally depressed after years of escaping a monster, and the knowledge of not being able to escape his fate (death)</li>
</ul>
<p>Personality change is believable after years, but returning to his original persona in a matter of days, really?<br>
Not to mention Yuri Lowenthal sounds kinda feminine, the one in Warrior Within was more manly.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I suppose you’re right, and him turning back to normal immediately is a bit odd, but I hated his WW personality and voice actor so much I was happy to welcome the old guy back. Actually, that was one of my favorite parts about the first and third, the Prince is just a funny guy.</p>
<p>As for the voice actor…I wouldn’t say “feminine”, or “manly”, I’d describe the voices as one being a muffled sounding prince(WW), and the other being an asshole-voice(TT)  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<ul>
<li>after the ending with hooded man (Dark Prince) I couldn’t wait to play The Two Thrones only to be disappointed right away.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I actually liked the non-canon ending much better than the canon one…Getting a hint of the destruction followed by “What have I done…” Was much cooler than the more drawn out destruction, while the Prince fails to notice because he’s busy below deck with Kaileena. I do agree that the guy at the end of the canon ending was pretty cool, then again pretty disappointing in TT. The ending of WW was my favorite part of the game, both because I was done with the game, and that the final cutscene(s) was/were pretty cool.</p>

<p>Also a one big plothole, since Kaileena could see the future, how the fuck did she miss in the timeline their fucking ship sinking and getting captured?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If I remember correctly, she did see that coming. She explains at the end of TT that she wanted it to happen…Or whatever. Something like that.</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of TT, BTW. I consider it to be a decent/mediocre game that could have been a lot better. For instance, if they managed to get the old voice actors for the Vizier and Farah back it would have been great. I didn’t like what they did to those two characters…Also didn’t like the chariot races. Or the boss fights, though they were still better than WW’s fights.</p>
<p>I’d rank the PP games as such</p>
<ol>
<li>Sands of Time</li>
<li>Prince of Persia(2008 reboot)</li>
<li>Two Thrones/Rival Swords</li>
<li>Warrior Within</li>
</ol>
<p>Haven’t played Forgotten Sands yet…I almost bought it during the Steam sale, but then I saw that Ubisoft requires you to get an account at their site, and always be online while playing the SINGLEPLAYER game. Yeah, screw that.</p>

<p>ONTOPIC:</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but <span class="bbcode-b">Sonic Adventure 1</span> was one of my least favorites out of the series. I wanted to like it like all the other Sonic fans were, but it seemed I couldn’t get into it. The story was decent, but I always thought the game was too glitchy and the character campaigns were way too short. E-102 was the campaign where I had the most fun, but you could seriously beat it in half an hour (30 minutes average).</p>

<p>Warrior Within…Where to start? Sands of Time is one of my all-time favorite games. It had good gameplay, characters, story, and pretty good writing. WW ditches the good characters and writing in favor of angst and nearly nude women. An example for the writing would be the very first line in the game, spoken by the main character: “This storm shows us no mercy, we shall respond in kind!” Yea…Anyway, the story itself, or rather, the premise I thought was actually quite interesting. But the way they did it was horrible. Don’t even get me started on the complete personality redo on the Prince…The new combat system had a few cool new ideas, but like the story, they were handled badly. I won’t get into it since I’m already running too long. The third Prince game, while not anywhere near as good as Sands of Time, was still miles better than WW, IMO. It fixed all the problems I had with the combat, and it brought the old Prince back. Shame they ruined Farah, and that there’s no character arc like in Sands, which is probably the best part of the game.</p>

</aside>
<p>Finally the first person not to call me a tard for being an individual.<br>
While I respect your opinion, I kinda disagree… let’s start:</p>
<ul>
<li>While unnecessary, what’s wrong with a well-endowed female warrior?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
I really hated how Kaileena has changed in a matter of few days (in-game) to something almost unrecognizable.</li>
<li>The combat was great, time-traveling added lots of backtracking, but it was never the same.</li>
<li>Dahaka chases were great as well, a sense of danger.</li>
<li>IMO the “personality redo” was justified and believable, as the Prince got mentally depressed after years of escaping a monster, and the knowledge of not being able to escape his fate (death)</li>
<li>The music though more modern, it still had the likeable vibe from Sands of Time.</li>
<li>after the ending with hooded man (Dark Prince) I couldn’t wait to play The Two Thrones only to be disappointed right away.</li>
<li>A lots of weapons, secret stuff and artwork to unlock</li>
<li>good platforming and puzzles</li>
</ul>
<p>I rate Warrior Within to be only a slightly worse than Sands of Time, but the 3rd one sucked hard.<br>
Personality change is believable after years, but returning to his original persona in a matter of days, really?<br>
Not to mention Yuri Lowenthal sounds kinda feminine, the one in Warrior Within was more manly.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that the engine used in The Two Thrones was SO BAD, with a lot of bugs/glitches and the graphics in some places were like from PS1 era, fire/flame effects noticeably.<br>
With models really bad, especially blocky hands.</p>
<p>Addition of “speed-kills” or I’d call it “semi-QTEs”  didn’t help either.</p>
<p>I have much more to say on the topic, but as well it would be too long.<br>
So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sands of Time</li>
<li>Warrior Within</li>
<li>The Two Thrones</li>
</ol>

While Two Thrones was a better sequel to Sands of Time, it was a disgrace to what Warrior Within has established.</p>
<p>Surely the worst of the trilogy</p>

</aside>
<p>Heh…Funny, I came to this thread to list Warrior Within as one of my least favorite games  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But yeah, three worst games I’ve played are probably:</p>
<p>The Force Unleashed 2<br>
The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion<br>
Prince of Persia: Warrior Within</p>
<p>TFU2 was just amazingly bad. The first I consider to be a decent game, but the second is a downgrade in every aspect save for graphics. The gameplay is worse, the story is absolutely pathetic, the game is so ridiculously padded and drawn out, but somehow it’s STILL too short. A four hour game, at most, and it feels like over half of it is just copy+pasted levels.</p>
<p>Onto the next one…I know this isn’t a very popular opinion, but I just couldn’t get into Oblivion. I WANTED to love the game. I saw screenshots and trailers, and thought, “That game looks awesome!”. I’ve started the game several times now, hoping to get into it, trying it with and without mods, but every time I end up getting bored and quitting. No dialogue options, no real story, every “character” is the exact same thing, the areas are copy+pasted, and the VOs get really annoying after you’ve heard them dozens of times. Really the only thing I liked was the music. And I suppose I’ve gotta give Bethesda a thumbs-up for making it so moddable, since so few devs do that these days.</p>
<p>Warrior Within…Where to start? Sands of Time is one of my all-time favorite games. It had good gameplay, characters, story, and pretty good writing. WW ditches the good characters and writing in favor of angst and nearly nude women. An example for the writing would be the very first line in the game, spoken by the main character: “This storm shows us no mercy, we shall respond in kind!” Yea…Anyway, the story itself, or rather, the premise I thought was actually quite interesting. But the way they did it was horrible.

It fixed all the problems I had with the combat, and it brought the old Prince back. Shame they ruined Farah, and that there’s no character arc like in Sands, which is probably the best part of the game.</p>
<p>TL,DR: TFU2 was a pathetic cash-grab, Oblivion was boring, and WW just sucked.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why people are hating on BF3’s campaign, but it’s not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. It does everything better than MW has been doing it and it doesn’t take them 3 games to chase and gun-down one guy.</p>

            <p>The thing that killed BF3’s singleplayer for me isn’t that it’s linear, but that the AI is so terrible. It’s like you pop your head out of cover and immediately every enemy in like a 200  meter radius homes in on your head. I don’t recall BC2’s AI being that bad so I wonder what they did. Medal of Honor runs on the same engine, did they fix that problem for its release? MoH wasn’t made by DICE so I suppose it could just be that DICE is terrible at coding AI and combine that with them having to use a brand new engine.</p>

            <p>the appeal for COD’s Zombies is that it’s a much more arcadey and open experience than anything else like it. L4d doesn’t have the tower defense elements, and Gears 3’s Horde doesn’t have the resource farming. The zombies are classic shamblers, which is rare nowadays, and the weapons are way more varied and “out there” at times.</p>
<p>Plus, any game that lets me choose to play as Danny Trejo, Michael Rooker, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Robert Englund IN CO-OP is a fucking winner. <span class="bbcode-i">Full stop.</span></p>
