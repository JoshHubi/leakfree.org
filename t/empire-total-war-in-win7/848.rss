    <title>Empire Total War in Win7</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/empire-total-war-in-win7/848</link>
    <description>So I got ETW today from EB Games and after slowly downloading the forced steam update I tried to run the game, when I get to the menu its just glitching to the extreme, flashing to loads screen and menu&#39;s overlap and stay when I go to other menu&#39;s.

I took a screenshot but fraps and printscreen both showed up blank white images.

I managed to navigate though and start up a quick mission but when loading it was going through the load bar it constantly flashed back to the desktop, back to the load screen and so on till it finished, which took very long.

Once it was loaded, the game wasn&#39;t much better, very slow and stuttered, along with geometric glitches (remember the picture of HL2 metro cop I posted a while ago, but not as bad).

I tired going to from Pixel Shader 3 to 2 but no avail.

I&#39;m on build 7127. PC specs aren&#39;t needed, they well surpass the recommended ones. I&#39;m also using the latest drivers for my vid card.

I scoured google but no results thats I can find match my same problems.</description>

            <p>Like I said, I’ve heard about it many times.</p>
<p>But It’s not implemented in the Build I use.</p>
<p>:facepalm:</p>

            <p>I also heard about that, but I haven’t found anything like it yet.</p>
<p>But, recently Build 7600 popped up in torrents, so when I get the chance, I’ll try getting that one and seeing if it has it.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I might just buy a new SATA HDD and dual boot XP.</p>

            <p>Isn’t there a thing in Win7 where it runs a version of XP in a VM for stuff like this? I seem to recall hearing something about that recently.</p>
