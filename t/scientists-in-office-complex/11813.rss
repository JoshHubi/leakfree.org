    <title>Scientists in Office Complex</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/scientists-in-office-complex/11813</link>
    <description>One thing that I thought was weird about the game was how there were people in lab coats working in the Office Complex. After all, you would have accountants and people who work with money in the office complex, not scientists... 
So, because I have no artistic talent, nor any idea how to do this, I call to the community to create a skin for the &quot;scientist&quot; model exclusively in the office complex to look more office-like, as in having a blue collared shirt with a tie. I actually have no idea whether this is possible, but could you guys try? This bugged me quite a bit in Half Life, and I was hoping it would have been addressed, but I guess not. Yeah... If you can, that&#39;s excellent, if you can&#39;t, well... Lets just focus on this, okay? 
PS: I know this may seem petty, but small things like these can impact the immersion of the game. Still an Awesome Awesome game though... I certainly won&#39;t deny that.</description>

            <p>I mean, how? Pretty much everyone in the BMRF dies. Freeman seems to be the only one able to mow down the aliens and the military, and the guards even have a hard time. How do you expect office workers to successfully escape? I mean, it’s a fine theory and all, but it would certainly be nice to have some office workers lying around.</p>

            <p>Utterly bemused, everyone in the offices on my floor aside from the main office is populated entirely by scientists, many of whom will leave their lab coat on when moving around. No reason to presume Black Mesa would be any different.</p>

            <p>Eh, considering a massive scale invasion is taking place, my fan theory is that all the office personell were evacuated from the office complex and the scientists ended up taking shelter there.</p>

<p>Sorry, I should have made clearer instructions. The ones you are meant to replace can be found in “<span class="bbcode-i">materials\models\humans\sciencenm2</span>”. If you haven’t made backups, then I can host the files you need.</p>
