    <title>CMOS battery issues?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cmos-battery-issues/7178</link>
    <description>Hey, 
So the computer i bought still works great, but every time i unplug the power(i usually do) and power it up again, it tells me to enter BIOS to change settings. So i enter BIOS, and exit it again, and then the computer boots. The time doesn&#39;t seem to be saved.

It&#39;s been like this since i got it, but there is no easy way to check if the CMOS battery is even there, if i want to do it, i&#39;ll have to remove the Thermal Armor that covers pretty much the whole motherboard.

Do anyone know if it&#39;s just a BIOS setting or anything?

Here is the specs:

            <p>This is actually a common thing if you at some point mounted the mobo without spaces (shame on you btw), you should make sure you mount it properly, fit a new cmos battery and flash it, this should fix your issues.</p>

            <p>I think you don’t need to flash it, just get a new battery and set all the settings.</p>

            <p>You can still flash the BIOS. Seems like a little bit of a design oversight to not have the battery accessable through that air diffuser.</p>

            <p>I once had a problem when BIOS would reset each time the PC restarts. The problem was with checksum numbers. An incorrect number was stored in the bios (or wherever it is stored), so every time the PC starts, bios gets an error of some sort and resets all settings. That got fixed in a later update.</p>
<p>I hope you get the idea. I had this problem at least a few years ago and I only remember reading the list of fixes in the new update and there was one mentioning settings reseting and checksum numbers.</p>

            <p>But what if the battery shorted out? Also, i already knew about what you were posting(I’ve replaced a CMOS battery before), but on this motherboard, i have to remove this black box that covers pretty much the whole board to get to the CMOS battery;<br>
<img src="https://www.hardocp.com/images/articles/129817345793b3egGP2p_1_8_l.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>So it’s a bit harder.</p>
<p>EDIT: also, i checked just now, my BIOS is already the latest version, so should i flash it or not?</p>

            <p>You didn’t FRY the battery. It’s impossible to fry the CMOS without frying your entire board. CMOS batteries exist ONLY to hold your bios information, and boot to said preferences. CMOS batteries are not on a permanent power supply, hence the name cmos “BATTERY”. CMOS batteries die all of the time, especially in computers that are older. They aren’t expensive, you can probably get one for like 7 dollars at a nearby radioshack. It’s round and silver, shouldn’t be hard to find on your MOBO to remove/replace.</p>
<p>Also, the reason it makes you enter your bios is because in doing so you’re setting the bios to default, giving the bios the incentive to boot to windows on whatever drive.</p>
<p>Do some research, you could learn all of this on google in 10 minutes like i did two years ago when my first CMOS battery died.</p>

            <p>I have an old computer that had been sitting in a shed for so long that the CMOS battery had run flat… ended up taking a working battery from my friend’s dead Dell (a much newer computer that had some sort of massive thermal meltdown).</p>
<p>'twas quite annoying as I had to keep re-overclocking its P2 233MHz processor every time it booted to get the performance I was after  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>haha your CMOS shorted out… It should work with a new battery CR2032 or just use internet time. I guess you’re lucky the default bios settings are good for you, I have to change a few to make my PC run like I want.</p>

            <p>If you have a look at some pictures of the motherboard, you see that most of it is covered by some black stuff. I need to remove all that. I’ll try to flash it tomorrow, i’m going to bed now  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>It’s possible. You could try flashing your BIOS with the latest copy, just to make sure that something didn’t get corrupted when you tried the spacerless install. The CMOS battery is usually a CR2032 Lithium button cell, and is easy to replace, if that is the problem. I’ve never heard of “Thermal Armor”,so I don’t know what it would take to get around that.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it’s pretty weird. Maybe i fried the battery when i started the computer without spacers?</p>

            <p>Most likely CMOS battery which is appalling considering how long you have had the board. Have you checked if similar issues are fixed in later BIOS revisions? Check Asus’ website and downloads for your board.</p>
