    <description>There is already a hate thread for &quot;overrated&quot; games, but what games do you think deserve more attention?

Here&#39;s mine:

-Psychonauts- Totally awesome. Deserves a sequel.
-Psi-Ops- Basically invented physics in videogames
-Army of Two- Co-op with a HUMAN partner was a blast. So was getting a gold-plated AK-47 with an undermounted shotgun.</description>

<p>It was fun, ergo good game.</p>
<p>It was poorly rated, but a good game, ergo underrated.</p>
<p>At time of release, I’m sure that there wasn’t enough content to make it worth the asking price, and I would agree with you. But at $5 a pop, there’s no way that it’s overpriced.</p>

<p>Oh man, don’t be dissing The Shrike of the Hyperion Omnibus series, that was exceptionally badass as well.  All the same, very cool indeed.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with your summary of the flaws of Op4, most especially with regards to Race-X.  I did appreciate what they were trying to do with the next stage of headcrab zombie though, that was kind of cool, they also got the boss fights right (I felt Valve dropped the ball on the two that were in Half-Life, not counting Gargantua as a boss).</p>

They did this to a degree, but I think there should have been a bit more to it.</p>
<p>All in all though, I know I’m being overly critical of BS.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree, helping scientists more would have been epic. And the Op4 boss fight was epic as well (both the end fight and the garbage monster thingy)</p>
<p>I also agree about the nihilanth boss fight, but are you seriously dissing the tentacle fight? that was one of my favorite chapters of the game!</p>

            <p>MY FREAKING GOD NO!<br>
sorry. that’s like the 50th time on this forum that someone’s asked me if I got my username from Shrike from whatever scifi novel he wrote. It’s from the totally badass 40K character.</p>
<p><a href="https://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Kayvaan_Shrike" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Kayvaan_Shrike</a><br>
and a pic of the model (kinda bad paint job, but shows the epicness of it)<br>

<p>Back to the topic at hand:<br>
While yes, it was really short, what was there was great. Excellent locales (maintenance tunnels, huge water place, TRAINYARD, and the excellent sequence end quest thingy, all stand out as superb) It didn’t add much new stuff, in fact it had fewer weapons than the original, but<br>
a) Op4 seemed to me like Gearbox felt the need to slap some new weapons on to make it feel different, plus I didn’t really feel the need for Race X (it’d be so amazing if they had just had regular xen aliens, so the events of Op4 and BS could be considered more canon)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>b)Barney’s a security guard, so it seems more fitting for him to be carrying more standard weaponry (if you can consider a laser guided rocket launcher standard weaponry)</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I loved Op4 as well, but I thought that BS preserved the original feeling of BM more than Op4 did. It was short, but well made, with interesting action throughout.</p>

<p>Really?</p>
<p>I think BS could have used a bit more to it.  It was cool for what it was, and actually did better things with Xen than Half-Life, but all in all it felt lacking, even for an expansion campaign.</p>
<p>P.S. are you a Dan Simmons fan?</p>

            <p>@ Soup, did you play it at the time of release?  I remember being thoroughly impressed by the game on the old PS1.  In retrospect I can agree with you on the environments though (though I almost think they were made that way deliberately, often very maze like with similar scenery).</p>

<p>Aside from his own personal level making, he’s made great strides in recreating the first level of Dark Forces 2:Jedi Knight.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen whether he’s actually joined the team of the currently in progress Dark Forces mod, but he has posted a good bunch over at that mods forums.</p>
<p>He’s also got a talented friend of his (Omnisu) posting there too.  Which is great, as that community (and particularly that forum) was really losing steam.</p>
<p>Everyone over there is doing phenomenal work bringing those old school games to the JK3 engine.</p>

<p>What?! Monkey Island 3 was the good one! The graphic style was like a work of art, and I thought it had some pretty great stuff in there.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The first two were my favourite games for years, so I  couldn’t accept the move to cartoony graphics. And when they dropped Ron Gilbert, I lost all interest in the story. Even so, I wouldn’t  play another Monkey Island game even if it was redone by Gilbert. The first game was sublime, but the sequel wasn’t anywhere near as witty and the story was bland.</p>
<p>But I hope Yahtzee writes some more adventure games one day. I loved the Chzo Mythos series.</p>

<p>You’ve actually made me want to play, despite my misgivings. I’ll be sure to check around the gaming store next time I go there.</p>

<p>Digimon world? Hmmm… How about some arguments? Why is it underrated?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>People pass it off as something spun out-of the children’s anime, it was actually created before the anime but to market it Bandai America put the anime logo on the front (Despite Digimon shown on the logo not actually being in the game at all)</p>
<p>It had a poor translation, it doesn’t effect gameplay which is what makes it so great, grammar was just weird, the Digimon (To make it suitable for children) had watered-down dialogue, so they said very weird stuff, Greymon wanted to fight the hero for the prize of…An invisible street sign…(Sigh)</p>
<p>It was like was 4Kids did to Naruto and YuGiOh.</p>
<p>The graphics for PS1 were really good, it was at the same level as FFIX.</p>
<p>People just passed it off from the cover. I came across it when my dad told me to pick a game to rent for his PS1 when i was young, there was nothing there he didn’t have so I went with digimon world, as I had a digimon pet (still do). I was shocked to find the game was about the same digimon pets, (which were shadowed by the anime). I didn’t understand the game mechanics back then, but returning as an adult the game works brilliantly, grind is very optional, you are forced to get fresh digimon, however can save battle data to fight your digimon against your friend’s on their memory cards (That was cool), there’s no fluke in the game it’s all play-skill and judgement, you can hang outside a dungeon for ages deciding if your digimon is strong enough to take it, then returning back to the city for supplies and risking it, ah it’s so good.<br>
When I returned to play it I completed it in a day, not because it has short play-time, but because i knew how to raise a good digimon (Otherwise, Myst would have a game-play time of 20 seconds).</p>
<p>If you have it at hand, give it a chance and play it.</p>
