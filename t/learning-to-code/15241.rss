    <title>Learning to code?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/learning-to-code/15241</link>
    <description>I&#39;m seeking a cheap and effective means of learning how to work on the Source Engine&#39;s C++ code, possibly to do modifications to npc_combine_s states, or more rote things like fixes to support more dynamic lights or adding CSS style bullet penetration/the SLAM mine from HL2DM to HL2. I have basically zero knowledge in programming, but I have worked with Source I/O in maps for many years, which my mate says is effectively a visual representation of coding. Where would be a good place to start?</description>

            <p>I don’t have much experience with working with Source, but for C++ the bar-none IDE is <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">MS’ Visual Studio</a>, it doesn’t mean you can’t use other IDEs, Notepad++ can work too. Provided you have it set up correctly. If I were you I’d still learn Visual Studio, especially if you want to go into the gaming industry, its pretty much the industry standard there.</p>

<p>^ Use those. They’re invaluable.</p>
<p>That’s about all I can say. If someone wants to explain further about working with source, I’ll turn it over.</p>
