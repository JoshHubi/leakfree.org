    <title>Imagine Steam on IPad?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/imagine-steam-on-ipad/4090</link>
    <description>Imagine Steam for IPad that can happen but maybe play some games like errr World Of Goo, Dirt, Command And Conquer etc.
Games that wont work for sure are FPS games :/ But it would be cool if Steam was for IPad wouldn&#39;t you think so?  :smiley:

            <p>I’ve been mulling over the possibilities of the touch screen iPod/iPad for gaming for some time. I’ve come to the conclusion that no one will ever develop a serious game for it. I came up with a good squad-based tactics/turn-based tactics game that would benefit greatly from the touch screen and the graphics potential over the DSi, but I’m pretty sure no one would actually want a hardcore game for the iPhone. I mean, look at the best selling apps on the Store right now. It’s pretty much a casual gaming dominated market. Tank shooters, airplane traffic control games, maybe a port of Plants vs. Zombies might work.</p>
<p>But the market demand for hardcore gaming on those devices is quite literally nill. If there were a market for hardcore titles on the iPad I’d have some ideas to work with. But as it stands, anyone who tries will be throwing money down a black hole because no one would buy it.</p>

<p>you don’t have to be a mac user to own an iphone or ipod, but you do have to be a mac user to own an ipad. Ipad dominates it’s market simply because the tablet is a small one, and for good reason too; netbook&gt;tablet.</p>

            <p>FPS for the iPad wouldn’t have to use tilt at all. The screen is big enough to allocate a virtual WASD on one side and the mouselook on the other.</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah, the app stores for smartphones and portable media players already have plenty of games of their own, so Steam won’t be really necessary there.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>People question the reason I have an iPhone vs an Android all the time because I’m a gamer and use Windows7. So true on that.</p>
<p>Also, Steam on the iPad would suck mainly because of key functionality. Sure you can tilt and twist and tap and crap, but so many users are used to FPS using the mouse to aim along with WASD to move or God forbid the select few that use the arrows. I have a motion sensitive FPS on the iPhone 4 and it lacks just that. No way to move forward because tilt is to aim, and tapping the screen is to shoot. Very limited options. And don’t give me the “Its screen is big so you can add the buttons to move too.” because then you’ll be tilting the device with one hand while using the other to move and you’ll not have access to a third hand to tap the screen to fire.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why this would even be a topic of discussion. A good discussion is one that is thought out for a while and ensures it’s even remotely plausible and functional. This just isn’t a feature that makes sense to put on a device such as an iPad. Though as others have stated, a community/chat feature would be neat. Along with linking to your home computer so for example, I’m at a friends place and he has a game I really want. I tap into my app, it interacts with my computer via interwebs and syncs with Steam on my PC at home [must be turned on already], and initiates the download after I buy it via my phone. So when I go home, the game is downloaded and ready to go or at least grants the customer a head start.</p>
<p>Gaming wise: Fail - Community wise: Good</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, yes it does have a big screen, but it is also an awful product in general mainly because it isn’t worth the price. And shouldn’t valve release it for a platform their customers and fans actually use? Look how few mac users are on this forum. Not many. And those that are (bolteh) probably aren’t fanboy enough to buy an ipad.</p>
<p>Now that said it is true that there are also very few steam users using zuneHD. (on this forum I think I might be the only ZHD user) I simply said it’d be better because I own one.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I wouldn’t mind a community-based Steam app for iPhone/iPod/iPad. Though I guess it would be limited to Steam-chat/Friends/News/Store-browsing.</p>
<p>There won’t be any games due to the fact that a Steam-store for iPhone/iPod/iPad apps would rival Apple’s Appstore, and Apple would never allow that.</p>
