    <title>Weapons not showing after I&#39;ve picked them up.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weapons-not-showing-after-ive-picked-them-up/10143</link>
    <description>The game runs very smoothly for me, and I am already loving everything about it.

But I&#39;ve run into a problem after picking up both the crowbar and pistol.

Their first person models are missing, I used the automated installer so I don&#39;t know if that factors into it or not, but if someone knows, can they tell me which file I need to grab from the archive and put in manually?</description>

            <p>Even better. I managed to fix the problem permanently by going into the archive and placing the weapon model folder in manually. Seemed to do the trick. I am really loving the Revolver!</p>

<p>I had a similar issue with HL Source back in the day (well a day before BMS release). The way I fixed it was this.</p>
<p>Start a new game, reloading saves where its happened doesn’t work.<br>
As the game starts, on the tram before you get anything type “r_drawviewmodel 1” in the console.<br>
Once you get the crowbar it should show up. Along with the rest of the weapons.</p>
<p>Whether this will work for BMS IDK but its worth a try, I’ll tell you, its really hard to hit headcrab’s without the crowbar model.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just tried it out. Started the game from Unforeseen Consequences and it worked! Thanks a bunch dude.</p>

<p>Okay this actually works.</p>
<p>I loaded up a new game and as Dr Tub suggest, when the tram intro started I pulled up the console and typed r_drawviewmodel 1. I <span class="bbcode-i">had</span> tried it during the game and it didn’t work, there’s something about doing it before picking up the first weapon I guess?</p>

<p>This worked for me as well, and I went ahead and added it to my config.cfg file so I wouldn’t have to type it again. I had made it to Blast Pit, and while it didn’t work with my saved game, I was able to start a new game at Blast Pit and the models were showing up again.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip!</p>

            <p>I’m on board with that as well. No crowbar shows up, and after doing impulse 101, I cant get any weapons to appear.</p>

            <p>I’m thirding this issue.</p>
<p>I’ve verified the installation of source 2007 SDK, I’ve tried multiple resolutions and aspect ratios. I’ve tried enabling console and playing with r_drawviewmodel 1 and thirdperson / firstperson. Can’t get it to work.</p>
