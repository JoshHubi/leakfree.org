    <title>What Exactly Are the &quot;Combine&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-exactly-are-the-combine/12933</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been looking at many discussions talking about the intentions and plans of the Combine, but I haven&#39;t seen a discussion as to who the Combine are, and why they call themselves &quot;Combine.&quot; I&#39;d like to discuss what they are, and what sets them apart from Xen aliens.

Thins we know:

1) They&#39;re from one of the Border Worlds.

2) They have plenty of headcrabs like Xen and use them a lot.

3)Their technology is not purely biological, as with Xen&#39;s technology, but they are partly bilogical, like some of their ships and the Striders.

4) They can brainwash or genetically engineer humans to become their soldiers.

5) Even though the Vortigaunts have been enslaved by the Combine before, the Combine doesn&#39;t use any Vort slaves in their army. 

6) They don&#39;t have as large a variety of alien soldiers as the Nihilinth has. (Must account for the Nihilinth being able to keep the Combine off his turf pretty well)

7) They just refer to themselves as &quot;Combine.&quot; Is it short for something, or do they just like &quot;Combine,&quot; because they just want to combine? Why not something after their name, like CHOAM from Dune? You know, the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles? I&#39;d much prefer to know what their real alien name is. Perhaps &quot;Combine&quot; was the closest approximate translation for what their alien empire is in their native language. 

8) They really like using altered humans a lot for their plans. More so than they like using members of their own species. 

What we don&#39;t know:

1) Why they like to take over everything.

2) Why the G-Man and his employers&#39; control over Xen didn&#39;t stave off the Combine, if they wanted to.

3) Why exactly do they find Gordon a threat, since Gordon only took out their enemy the Nihilinth.

4) Where the Combine&#39;s homeworld is.

5) Who the Big Bad Ultimate Leader of the Combine is.

Any thoughts?</description>

</aside>
<p>Well, you’re actually right.  It’s been stated that’s exactly what the Combine is.  However, I personally would imagine that like any organization, it has a leader.  Who or what that leader is, we don’t know.  So far, it seems the leader/leaders are the Advisors, although even they may be part of something larger.</p>

<p>Lots of good stuff in this thread, confirmed by Marc Laidlaw himself.</p>
<p>The Nihilanth was the last of it’s kind, the others hunted to extinction by the Combine. It was never captured by the Combine, so it’s appendages and scars and synthetic parts were the result of some other operation. Perhaps that was part of the technology of it’s home world, and the Combine took it and merged it with their own technology, influencing the synths we see in HL2.</p>
<p>His legs appear stunted and withered. Perhaps the mechanical bit under him is similar to a human wheelchair? He can’t move on his own, so the spikes help him move around. Maybe he was attacked by the Combine, and nearly died, but was repaired enough that he could escape to Xen?</p>

<p>I wish they weren’t so ambiguous about some things like canon.  One thing I never liked was how Valve is like ‘yeah, this is not canon or non-canon and yeah, this HL3 may or may not happen but we’re just gonna talk about Steam and other things.’  Also, some of that article does appear outdated.  But I’m derailing the topic if I rant on about this.</p>

            <p>I wonder if we’ll ever see other races appear should another HL game be made?  I kind of like the cut Alien Combine Soldier.  I mean, they send humans to off-world locations as punishment so they must do it to other aliens to.  Sending an conquered being from another alien race to Earth would probably be hellish for them.</p>

            <p>Regarding the Vorts, and their ‘status’ in HL2:</p>
<p>Before HL1, the Nihilanth was the master of the Vortigaunts, which were enslaved. How the Nihilanth came to rule the Vorts is unclear. At some point, the combine invaded the Nihilanth’s home world. Unable to fend them off, the Nihilanth and it’s forces fled to Xen, since the Nihilanth was able to open and maintain dimensional portals.</p>
<p>During HL1, the resonance cascade opened a portal to Xen for a brief moment. The Nihilanth, pursued by the Combine, kept the portal open and began an invasion in an attempt to gain separation from them.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the death of the Nihilanth. With it gone, the Vortigaunts are no longer enslaved. Because of this, they view Freeman as their messiah because he freed them from the Nihilanth. Meanwhile, while chasing the Nihilanth, the Combine became aware of Earth, and launched their own invasion from Xen, presumably after exhausting the resources of the Nihilanths’s world. During this invasion, the Vortigaunts fled to Earth, and have chosen to ally themselves with humans and the ‘Free-man’. That’s why they are all cuddly and fuzzy in HL2, they were forced to attack Freeman in HL1, and they harbor no ill will toward him and forgive him for killing them.</p>

            <p>Think it was more just because G-Man’s employers wanted access to Xen, and the Nihilanth controlled Xen at that time, to the point of being able to mentally control the fabric of reality there.</p>

            <p>Now that I think of it, maybe the reason the G-Man has you off Nihilanth is because Nihilanth knows that g-Man is a traitor to the combine, but none of the other advisors are aware. So G-Man had you do his dirty work haha</p>

            <p>Supposedly, the Advisors were similar to humans and they mutated into that grub form over time due to an over reliance of technology.  I don’t know if that means they appeared human-like or were just some kind of bipedal race but it still interests me what it means when they ‘hatch’.</p>

            <p>Maybe he wasn’t a renegade, maybe all those aliens were used as an advance boarding party. Cannon fodder or whatnot, to test earths defenses while weakening them enough for the combine to come in and become the head honcho’s.</p>

            <p>Another thing we don’t know is who or what really runs the Combine. It could be the Advisors but that’s never been proven. More than likely it’s whatever the Advisors are after they “hatch” from their larval form. Hopefully, if HL3 is ever released, we will find out.</p>
