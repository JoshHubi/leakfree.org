    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rock-band-and-gh-controllers-help/6405</link>
    <description>I am going to get Rock Band 3 for ps3 and seeing as all instruments for that game are expencive like hell Im thinking of getting the GH WOR superbundle and then get the standalone RB3.

So then I wonder are there any reason why I should not get the gh instruments and then just the RB3 game-disc (except pro-mode)?</description>
