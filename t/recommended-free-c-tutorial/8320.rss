<p>nuff’ said.</p>
<p>Also, C++ was my first programming language It didn’t take me but 2 weeks to get a good grasp of it’s basic functions, and then a month or so to learn the  deeper stuff. I am still learning Direct X and some other stuff with C++ but it really isn’t all that hard, It’s kind of like giving commands to someone but you have to speak in their language.(At least that’s how I see it). I also learned some Python afterwards and some C# and they are all not much different function-wise you just need to replace a few things from other programming languages and it’ll make sense.</p>

</aside>
<p>I came here to get advice on what tutorials do people think are good, not what tutorials are out there. Google is great for the second, but might not get you really far for the first. Also, I just like discussing things with real people. So please stop being a condescending douche and jumping to the “hurr durr google it” conclusion every condescending douche always does.</p>
<p>And, sorry but fuck web technologies and cloud solutions. Cloud computing and web technologies aren’t the future of coding, they’re just the future of ordinary applications and computer functions, which I find boring as shit.

<p>I would imagine he does, otherwise he wouldn’t have asked the question.</p>
<p>Well, that’s a dick thing to say.I don’t know why ANYONE would want to learn C# to be honest.</p>
<p>He didn’t say he NEEDED C++, he said he wanted to learn it. Stop being a jerk.</p>

<p>1: If he doesn’t know how to google, i’m sure C++ isn’t the thing for him.<br>
Simply because it is not a good beginner language</p>
<p>2: Right? The MSDN doc sucks, but the language is a good thing between C++ and fx Python, because it’s simple to use mainly because there is no dealing with pointers and memory management at all. And it’s very easy to create graphical applications because you have a high-level and flexible API (Win Forms) in contrary to C++ where you have numerous GUI libraries which all basicly sucks due to the low level API with hundreds of constants and pointers. And then it’s fast which no script language is except Node.js.</p>
<p>3: I’m not trying to be a dick, but seriously; only a few people will grasp C++ without any programming knowledge. And another thing is that C++ may be widely used BUT it have no future.</p>
<p>The best thing would be to invest his time to learn all the web technologies and develop some cloud solutions, it is, whether we like it or not, the future</p>

            <p>C++ isn’t exactly renowned for its simplicity. At the same time, however, it’s fast, powerful, and you can do pretty much anything with it. I agree, however, that a language change is coming, probably sooner rather than later. That’s why it’s important to learn programming and computer science and not just C++. That being said, I think that knowing C++ is pretty necessary for a career (in most cases) as a software engineer.</p>
<p>I feel like we’ve shifted away from the original intent of this thread.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>The function “main” is an int. Why didn’t you return one?</p>
<p>Quaker, C++ has its faults, but so does <span class="bbcode-i">every single other programming language out there</span>, including the ones you mentioned. C++'s prevalence in modern computer science is probably the main reason it gets so much flack, coupled with the fact that it can be difficult to master and as such is off-putting to those with weaker constitutions.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sure other languages have faults, but in case of C++ the amount of corner cases is almost unbelievable (ranging from half assery of various kinds through parser hostility and ambiguity to verbosity).</p>
<p>If you ever tried to lex/parse C++, you’d know well that C++ does anything but making it simple (because its grammar is not context free and ambiguities like the retarded template syntax get in the way).</p>
<p>The only reason C++ is still being used is availability of many good toolchains and resources. In this, the better languages still can’t compete. With C++ you can be sure you can always get a good compiler for every platform, lots of libraries and books. This is pretty much the reason I still use it, too. I’m preparing to migrate at some point, however.</p>
<p>As for return value from main, it’s not required to return from it in C++ (even though return value of main is always int). The value is implicit.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>“Using” entire namespaces is just a bad practice as it opens up all of the items in the namespace, which can create problems as std contains a lot of names you may not think about, leading to conflicts, etc. This is exacerbated if you’re working on a team and it messes up one of their namespaces. If you really hate the std:: in front of everything (and let’s be honest, I think we all do) use something like “using std::cout, std::endl , etc;.” In this example, it’s probably not going to create any problems, but it is a bad habit, and those are easier to weed out early. I would say NEVER declare a namespace globally or in a header; stick them in the scope of the function instead.</p>

            <p>C++ is <em>not</em> a good language to start with; yes, it is useful, but no, it’s NOT a good language. It has so many corner cases it’s almost unbelievable, many duplicate, half assed features, carries bloat all around, is hostile to parsers (not context-free and often ambiguous). These are mostly given by its history; it had to keep compatibility since the late 90’s. The only advantages of C++ are these days performance and availability of good toolchains, which is why it’s still used (I use it in my engine myself), but its share is steadily decreasing. These days implementations of other native languages can reach the performance level of C/C++ while being more modern, less half assed, parser friendly and without corner cases and duplicate features everywhere, and I expect these to grow more, much more (like D, Rust, Clay, Go, …)</p>

            <p>What Jethro and Snoogins said - Once you know <em>how</em> to program, picking up the different languages is easy.</p>
<p>The realm of C++ is pretty complicated though, with C++, VC++ (CLR/C++) and all that entails. I’m still getting started on it though, but the best way to learn is to think of a program to make and do it! If originally started with Visual Basic, nice easy way to get in to it all.</p>
<p>I’m actually in the process of making a little app that allows people to enter and store their expences and view a history of what they’ve spent (with different users, expense types, amount, date search etc all stored in an Access database).</p>

            <p>C++ is a fine language to start with. Don’t let anybody tell you different.</p>
<p>In an attempt to quell any fears over which language is the best one to learn, let me impart some advice: learn how to program, not just necessarily the intricacies of any specific language. There are tools and skills that are applicable to any computer programming language.</p>

            <p>I want to learn C++ because that, in my limited knowledge, is the most useful language for video games and ordinary computer software, which is my realm of interest. I tried starting out on C++ before but ran out of determination, I’m starting back up because I now have one and a half hours of free time every school day in which I get to do whatever the fuck I want. I ofc have a powerful machine that will have no trouble. As a few have pointed out, I started this thread not because I have trouble finding tutorials, but because  I don’t know which tutorials are good, and I didn’t think the top google result is a good enough standard of quality.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, thanks I"ll try out a couple of these tuts and see which I like. I understand that C++ may not be the best to start out with but I am bright (imo and according to statistics) and I have a shitload of time.</p>

            <p>The extensibility doesn’t matter here; you can always write a serialization method and use it with printf.</p>
<p>C++ streams are badly designed; your typical implementation is fatter than stdio, they’re also overly verbose:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">std::cout &lt;&lt; std::hex &lt;&lt; std: :s etfill('0') &lt;&lt; std: :s etw(8) &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; std::dec &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code></pre>
<p>vs</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">printf("0x%08xn", x);</code></pre>
<p>Typically, using stdio is no more error prone than using streams; non-POD types cannot be passed via varargs and even if you fuck up, the fix is always trivial. But that’s of course no problem if you actually look at what you are printing.</p>

<p>But i’m pretty sure what you really want is to learn either C# or Java</p>
<p>If you really needed C++ you would have a complex program that needed to be high performance and you would then probably be a skilled coder which didn’t create threads about where to find a tutorial</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://cplusplus.com" rel="nofollow noopener">cplusplus.com</a> tutorials are pretty good.  What platform are you planning on developing for?  Probably one of the more difficult parts of starting C++ is just setting up your development environment.  I think it’s a little faster to get started developing under Linux if you know Linux, otherwise Visual Studio Express seems to be the standard used by most libraries and applications under Windows, but I don’t have much experience with that one.</p>
<p>For more advanced techniques in c++, this book is a must have.  I wouldn’t suggest it now, but keep it in mind if you continue your c++ career: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Engineering-Introduction-Advanced-Techniques/dp/0201533936/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326304898&amp;sr=1-1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Engineering-Introduction-Advanced-Techniques/dp/0201533936/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326304898&amp;sr=1-1</a></p>

<p>Java happens to be a very easy programming language to get into, many beginners tutorials are available which deal in Java and it’s a very well supported and fully featured language. Many of the pitfalls you are likely to encounter with C++ can be avoided by using Java which can be a bit simpler and more forgiving.</p>
<p>In time when you’re ready you can move on to C++ and it won’t seem as daunting.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not sure if Java is easier than C++ to get into.  Sure, to do more advanced things in C++ you’ll have to use classes, pointers, templates, references and other topics which are considered a little more difficult to follow, but, initially, I would consider c++ much easier to use than Java.  Java forces you to use classes right off the bat;  Moreover, I’d really just say java’s different than C++, not harder.  People who start with C++ will find starting java harder and people who start with java will find starting c++ harder, just because they’re different from what you’re used to.  In the realm of languages, “if” you were looking for an easy language to start off with, I’d choose something like python or ruby, but, honestly, I suggest you choose the language you think you will need for what you want to do; Not what other people prefer.  You’ll find your own preference the more you program.  <span class="bbcode-i">Personally I prefer python and c++ over java and ruby.</span></p>

</aside>
<p>C++ will make as little or as much sense as you and the libraries you use make it.  I can find libraries in C++ and Java that are beautiful and libraries in C++ and Java that look like they were written in Klingon.</p>
