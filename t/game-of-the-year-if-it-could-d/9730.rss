    <description>Guys you did an amazing job with this, I&#39;m not done with the game yet and I&#39;m am stunned with all the amazing detail that is in this game. Everything about this game is great, I have no problems with bugs or any graphical issue&#39;s. I&#39;m still stunned that this was made by a group of people that simply wanted to make one of the greatest FPS&#39;s even better than before. You guys have taken the Source Engine to a whole another level. Very Nice Work!!!!  :slight_smile:   :slight_smile:   :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Mod of the Year maybe…(and this is <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">NOT </span></span>to take away from any of the AMAZING work this team did) there are, however, other mods out there that I believe would be equally worthy of the award.  This one will get more attention because Half Life is established, and it deserves the attention, but it will definitely overshadow other great mods.</p>

            <p>Can a game only receive a GOTY award if it’s commerical? They might have to make an exception for Black Mesa. This is something very rare that may not happen again for a long time.</p>

            <p>I would agree. Everything about this game felt like a triple A title. I had more fun with this MOD than fucking Battlefield or Call of Duty. That’s how good it is.</p>
