    <title>hammer/source splines question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hammer-source-splines-question/4211</link>
    <description>I&#39;m planning on making something in source in the coming months and there some fundamental things that I have to get cleared up first before I begin development. The most important one being an example in the form of a picture I created.

*note, the green lines aren&#39;t real, they are just there to show the relation between the two outputted values*
Is it possible to create splines that when moving along(iterating thu) the outputted distance would vary.

For example. If I move 2 units along the top line the position returned to me would be greater than If I moved 2 units along the bottom line.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>I’m still in the early planning stages at this point (ink and paper, and lots of it) So I cant answer the first part.</p>
<p>The idea is that the splines would just code helper objects, (and the green lines are just results AKA: don’t exist at all) and there existence in the map would be invisible. (aka no solid geometry) The splines would be created in an external program (like autocad) because Of the greater control involved. But now that you say it would source not allow the use of these lines, cant interpret the data as splines, or are you just saying that the creation of these objects in hammer would prove to be futal? and I still dont know if I can achieve my original goal of varying outputs… I’ll make a mini animation and post it later. Should clear up the confusion.</p>
<p>I’m asking all of this now because I like to have everything on paper before I hit a spine curtailing development problem in code later on.</p>
<p>EDIT: here is an animation<br>

            <p>Are you trying to do this in the existing build of Hammer or are you looking to write your own toolset? In either case doing something like this isn’t going to work very well…BSP likes convex shapes and hates concave ones. You could make shapes like the bottom-right image out of multiple brushes but it’s not going to have an extremely smooth spline-y curve.</p>
<p>Consider doing whatever it is you’re planning on doing in a 3D modeling suite that actually has spline modeling…</p>
