    <title>chapter 12 bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/chapter-12-bug/14639</link>
    <description>[align=justify]Hi devs.  I am coming here because i believe i found a bug on the game.
It´s happening now with me and it keep ocurring.
when i am at the chapter 12 surface tension, and got at the point that i need to run from an big alien that chases you and uses flametrowers on his arms
after runing from him, and got to the point that he breaks the door and i need to uses some alien plataform to jump on some structure that has a radio signal so i can call the air strike to kill the monster, if i die at this point the game crashes, if i try to load a save from this point the game crashes and after this i cant reload, its like it corrupt the save file after a die or if i try to load the game on this point. when i die and try to load the game it crashes and it cannot be restarted even on the steam, i need to verify the files integrity on the steam, only after the verification i can run the game and try to load the save again, but it crashes again, every momento that i try to load the save from this scene the game or crashes or corrupt the save, it can be observed because when i do the files integrity on the steam it shows that some files is corrupt and gonna download again.
i can normaly start a new game on the stage, that has been said by a programer on the steam comunity foruns of black mesa, at first i could play normaly until i got at the same part again and the whole process repeats.
Please help !  ;( 
thanks for your atention.[/align]</description>
