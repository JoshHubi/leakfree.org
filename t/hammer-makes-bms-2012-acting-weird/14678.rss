    <title>Hammer makes BMS (2012) acting weird</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hammer-makes-bms-2012-acting-weird/14678</link>
    <description>I tried to find an already existing thread about similar problems. Couldn´t find one so I created a new one. Now, I´m trying to make small changes for Black Mesa´s maps, like amplifying, changing or adding a sound. I went by [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=575363&amp;postcount=59&#39;]these instructions[/url] to configure Hammer, step-by-step. When everything was set, I opened Hammer and started doing my changes to BMS-maps and everything went nicely. Then I ran it and things like [url=&#39;https://youtu.be/uSSk5OXY7Nw&#39;]this[/url] happened. Has anyone else faced this problem? What did I do wrong? I did similar changes to Black Mesa´s retail version and nothing like this happened, not once. Please help!</description>

            <p>It isn’t that complicated, you can just disable all visgroups except areaportals and occluders, and then delete all.</p>
<p>For BMS 2012 mod, decompiling is the only way to edit them. We ship the retail vmfs with the retail game, but we don’t ship any mod vmfs anywhere.</p>

            <p>Damn, that sounds complicated. So, is decompiling origninal bsp´s the only way to edit BMS-maps in Hammer?</p>

            <p>You’re using decompiled maps, so the areaportals and occluders are broken, which causes things like that to happen. You have to delete all occluders and areaportals, and remake them from scratch.</p>

            <p>It looks like some form of visibility control is malfunctioning or not set up correctly, like possibly occluders or maybe areaportals. Are you recompiling a decompiled VMF? Decompiling isn’t a perfect science, it tends to break stuff, esp. tool brushes.</p>
