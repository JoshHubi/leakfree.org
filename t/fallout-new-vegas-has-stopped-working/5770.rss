    <title>Fallout New Vegas Has Stopped Working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fallout-new-vegas-has-stopped-working/5770</link>
    <description>Hello people, straight to it.

When attempting to play the game sometimes it will crash at Fallouts start menu, after pressing launch from steam, but if i re-try itll run and go into game, from the game menu, if i select new game load etc, itll will crash about 10 seconds into the loading screen, resize window with nothing (blank/black) and Windows error will appear as in thread title.

Tried different setups of low quality etc, different resoultions, and if this helps.

            <p>Have you tried loading a different save from the load screen? It’s possible your save could be corrupted, this happened to me on the weekend.</p>
<p>Re-installing is an option as well.</p>
