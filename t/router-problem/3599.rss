    <title>Router Problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/router-problem/3599</link>
    <description>My router as been reseting itself a lot lately over the past two weeks which as been driving me mad but I&#39;ve finally figured out what is causing it and it&#39;s nothing that&#39;s caused a problem in the past or anything I&#39;ve ever heard of before.

If one pc in the house is running Windows Live messenger it&#39;s fine. As soon as another pc signs in to messenger at the same time the router starts reseting itself every minute or so.

I&#39;ve also tried running two instances of messenger on my pc and again, as soon as the second messenger is signed in the router starts resting itself.
Any ideas what&#39;s causing this?
Oh by the way my router is the Thompson TG585v7
Thanks</description>

            <p>You could try one of the freeware alternatives like pidgin, trillian, etc they all work the same way as live messenger. Or use one of the web based alternatives like webmessenger, ebuddy, iloveim, etc.</p>
<p>I’m also using the router given by my ISP, it’s almost 5 years old and their first dsl modem that has built in wifi. Still, I’ve never had any problems with Live Messenger running on more than one computer.</p>
<p>As last resort you could try resetting the router to factory defaults or upgrading the firmware on it, It’s not an easy task mostly because you might have to call your ISP to help you configure it.</p>

            <p>Cheers Sersoft, I knew you’d reply.<br>
What other alternative do I use if everyone I talk to is on msn? I agree with the Router, it’s shite, but my ISP provided it. Also I ran two instances of messenger as an experiment.<br>
Anyway browsing my ISP’s website I found windows 7 has compatibilty issues with my router.<br>
<a href="https://www.beusergroup.co.uk/technotes/index.php/Modem_Firmware#Windows" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.beusergroup.co.uk/technotes/index.php/Modem_Firmware#Windows</a><br>
Why would that be the case though? It’s the same protocol as XP or any other OS, TCP/IP.<br>
Anyway forget it. I’ve had windows 7 since October but recentely after several windows updates, everythings just gone to Shit.<br>
I tried the patch above and it said my OS is out of date lol.<br>
I’ll reintall xp tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Lol. Problem solved. Yeah, seriously, why do you need two instances of Windows Live Messenger?</p>
<p>If you really need it, I would suggest finding out what ports WLM uses (I don’t know offhand, google it) and login to your router’s settings page (usually 192.168.0.1 in the address bar of your browser) and set up a virtual server OR portforward (not both) for your IP address.</p>

            <p>A. Stop using MSN Messenger.<br>
B. Get a new router.<br>
C. Only use MSN on one PC at a time.</p>
