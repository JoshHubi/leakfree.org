    <description>The latest twitter update suggests that they are just implementing some final details. I think the game is done with the exception of some really little tweaks.</description>

            <p>The developers should, right now, come out with a statement saying whether or not they believe they can release in 2009. Yes or no, it would quell most of the whining.</p>

<p>I’ve seen a lot of people spouting rubbish like “omg111!!!111onewon if the mod isn’t released this year I’ll kill your mother” (not with this mod, obviously), because they feel that they have been wronged by the modding team because they’ve relied on their false promise and, hence, will never come here any more <span class="bbcode-i">even if</span> the mod is released because they will rest that firmly on their morals.</p>
<p>In law, there’s a concept called ‘loss’. Its actually absurdly simple; if you suffer loss as a result of another person’s actions, then you can, <span class="bbcode-i">prima facie</span>, recover some compensation for your loss. In this situation, what loss has been suffered?</p>
<p>A good way to look at loss is through the ‘but for’ test. In this instance, <span class="bbcode-i">but for</span> the Devs’ promise of an '09 release date, where would people be, compared to if they didn’t make an '09 release date. If the Devs never made the '09 release date, then people will be absolutely no worse off than if the date had never been set. Either way, there’s no magical download button for them to press.</p>
<p>Hence, you haven’t suffered any loss. Hence, STFU.</p>
<p>/Lawyered</p>
<p>Also, what other promises hasn’t the Dev team lived up to?</p>

<p>A big thank you for this post; some people seem to think that we have legal obligations to fill when people are really just bringing needless anticipation on themselves.</p>

<p>People don’t like to be strung along by false promises.  The likes of which have been made around here multiple times.  The 2009 release date is the latest.</p>
<p>Why would people pay attention to something that isn’t coming out?  They made a commitment to 2009 and they will break it.  Who wants to support someone who continuously breaks commitments?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t recall us ever <span class="bbcode-i">promising</span> anything, especially the release date. Did we ever say “we guarantee you a release date this year”? Even commercial games get delayed sometimes but it doesn’t stop the player base from enjoying it for what it is. Sometimes delays are inevitable for a quality product; and many bugs and other problems in games are the result of rushed development and poor testing, neither of which are something we want to do. If people want to think the mod is dead and it’s not coming out, fine - we constantly post development videos on YT, occasionally post on the Twitter feed, and some of the devs are even crazy enough to post on these public boards. That level of community involvement apparently means the mod is dead and never coming out to some people; if they want to take it that way then that’s acceptable to me, because I don’t think we could convince them otherwise if we tried.</p>
<p>Basically, if people get angry and don’t play the mod out of spite for us, I don’t think we care, as I’ve said before. The people who appreciate the effort that has gone into this project and the people who are waiting patiently will be able to enjoy it while the others will whine no matter what we do.</p>

<p>We want to play the mod, but<br>
We don’t want to play a shit mod, so<br>
We can’t have the mod 'til it’s ready, therefore<br>
We need to support the developers</p>

            <p>sanatorium, how can you make any of those statements with a straight face?</p>
<p>“false promises”? “multiple times”? “2009 release date is the latest”?  Latest of what?</p>
<p>How can anyone say that the dev team has promised the game “multiple times” and has failed to deliver on said promise.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there has only ever been one date ever given, and that was simply “2009”.</p>
<p>Someone correct me if I am wrong or is phail santa just a mean santa?</p>

<p>You really don’t seem to get that people aren’t going to choose not to play a mod just because it came out later than planned. If Valve said Episode 3 was going to come out in December, and it was released in January, you wouldn’t buy it?</p>
<p>Bullshit. That’s just immature.</p>
<p>And this team isn’t even doing this professionally; it’s a hobby. Many may have had experience in game development, but do you really think they’ve ever been in charge of an entire product before? Especially one so renowned as Half-Life. They are taking all the time they need to make it the best game possible instead of some typical crap EA clone.</p>
<p>They have my support even if they don’t release until the end of 2010.</p>

            <p>what I find awsome is that one asstard signs on and says how the devs have failed them and they hate their life, and THEN 10 other guys come in and tell him he’s a faggot.</p>
<p>hows that boycotters?</p>

<p>I’ve seen a lot of people spouting rubbish like “omg111!!!111onewon if the mod isn’t released this year I’ll kill your mother” (not with this mod, obviously), because they feel that they have been wronged by the modding team because they’ve relied on their false promise and, hence, will never come here any more <span class="bbcode-i">even if</span> the mod is released because they will rest that firmly on their morals.</p>
<p>In law, there’s a concept called ‘loss’. Its actually absurdly simple; if you suffer loss as a result of another person’s actions, then you can, <span class="bbcode-i">prima facie</span>, recover some compensation for your loss. In this situation, what loss has been suffered?</p>
<p>A good way to look at loss is through the ‘but for’ test. In this instance, <span class="bbcode-i">but for</span> the Devs’ promise of an '09 release date, where would people be, compared to if they didn’t make an '09 release date. If the Devs never made the '09 release date, then people will be absolutely no worse off than if the date had never been set. Either way, there’s no magical download button for them to press.</p>
<p>Hence, you haven’t suffered any loss. Hence, STFU.</p>
<p>/Lawyered</p>
<p>Also, what other promises hasn’t the Dev team lived up to?</p>

<p>Yes! When the mod comes out, I won’t play it 'cause they didn’t make it to the end of 2009! That will show them! …Right?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Personally, I have been watching this mod for years with much excitement and expectation.  For those of you that remember enjoying the HL1 Coop Mod, <a href="https://www.svencoop.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sven Coop</a>, this in some ways has been the much anticipated fulfillment of that and so much more.</p>
<p>I know firsthand that development can take some time and doesn’t always go as planned, especially if you are doing everything to put out the best product with all those fine touches that you never really notice but it still wouldn’t be the same without.  Those things that make the difference between a good game and a great one.</p>
<p>As such, I would be happy to see the developers taking more time to finish their dream as opposed to rushing out something less just to meet the expectations of some proposed release date.  But that is only because I personally have high expectations for the quality of the game itself, not when it is released.</p>
<p>The other thing that comes to mind, is that this is being provided free of charge to everyone who will enjoy it, and so I would like to show my gratitude if nothing else than a “Thank You” to those taking the time out of their lives to make this a reality.</p>
<p>Although I know I don’t speak for everyone, I’m sure many feel the same way when I say that I will continue to anticipate Black Mesa (‘Source’) whenever it is released so keep up the good work. It really is appreciated.</p>

<p>You posted “The likes of which have been made around here multiple times” implies you have been here to see them broken. NOW, if your point is people are leaving because of such, then why haven’t you left yet then? You posting here is a paradox of your own point.</p>
<p>You, yourself, are the explanation for why people will always come back.</p>
<p>Why do we pay attention to something that may never come out? FOR GREAT JUSTICE! and a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Oh! and I come back to post off topic. BIRDS CANT FLY WITH RUFFLED FEATHERS!!! HAHAHAHHA</p>

<p>Well, sir, you can go and “leave” if the mod isn’t released this year, if that’s what pleases you. As for me and the rest of the non-insane community, we’ll be receiving the mod shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Wow. I almost wish they wouldn’t release it in 2009 (or ever, really), just to spite people like you.</p>
<p>The developers have worked countless hours for your enjoyment, for no monetary gain at all. This entitlement some of you have is amazing and sad. They owe you nothing, and you’re very lucky you’re getting it at all.</p>
