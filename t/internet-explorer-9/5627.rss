    <description>So yeah I just downloaded it, and... 

It&#39;s totally broken. If I try to start it up, all I get is a half-loaded page, and a &quot;IE9 encountered an unexpected error&quot; thing that won&#39;t shut down unless I kill IE9&#39;s process.</description>

<p>a great function of chrome is that it runs all tabs in different processes.</p>

</aside>
<p>I never found that this delivered the intended result; that, if one tab crashes, the others will be fine. That just never happened for me; it was always all or nothing on Windows, and I don’t use it enough on Mac to make an educated judgement on that. Its a good browser, don’t get me wrong, but I always tend to go for Safari just because of how well it integrates with the Mac, both functionally and stylistically. Chrome is simple, functional, tight, stable and lightweight; but I never found it to deliver that particular function.</p>

</aside>
<p>Indeed, I have never seen FF use more than 200 MBs before and I sometimes have 20+ tabs open at a time. Right now I only view this forum and it hovers around 60 MBs. I’m going to guess that you triggered a nasty memory leak bug somewhere in the main program or an extension, or you really need to clean the personal browsing data.</p>

</aside>
<p>Because the role of a web designer/developer is to build a working website for a client. And when IE still control a sizable portion of the browser usage, we HAVE to code websites to work with it. Even IE6 still has ~5% of all internet usage, and it was out of date when it was shipped with XP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Considering that there are 4 browsers available that all do everything 99% right 99% of the time, why the fuck would anyone who doesn’t design and build websites install IE on purpose?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh, the reason’s actually really simple: Because Microsoft install it with Windows. I’d love to get usage statistics from the EU, but I can imagine that usage of IE would go down exponentially when you open up the choice for the uninformed. The people who just buy computers and don’t take an interest in the other options for anything, especially internet browsing, are never exposed to the variety of choice.</p>
<p>This, combined with the fact that people, especially in relation to computers, always have the “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” mindset, so the more that webmasters make allowances for IE the more we’re encouraging people. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with IE; its just that its absolutely foul when compared to the other browsers. That means that if you never compare it to anything, you never get a perspective on just how ludicrously retarded it is. As such, people never really understand how unbelievably full of fail it is until someone shoves a new browser under their nose, which, at the moment, only the EU is doing.</p>
<p>Case in point, I have a friend who once told me that his hard drive kept getting full. It was 4GB. It wasn’t until two years ago that he finally decided to convince his parents to replace it, almost eight years since it had been initially purchased. He had to shut everything down just to open Sim City 4, which played like slow piece of crap when he tried to show me anything. I brought him over to my house and showed him by uber computer. He was actually surprised at how slow his was. My dad did the same thing; on buying his new computer, he honestly asked me how I could have let him continue using his old one for so long.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Lack of information is a bitch. If people knew how lousy IE was, they’d switch in a heartbeat. Unless, of course, they’re the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/08/despite-petition-uk-government-to-keep-ie6.ars" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">UK Government</a>.</p>

<p>I just don’t get it. That, and I don’t understand why MS need to re-interpret web standards in their own special way so that not only does everything break in every version of IE, it all breaks <span class="bbcode-i">differently to the last version</span>. I swear to god they fix three problems and then to balance things out a bit deliberately create a new one seemingly at random.</p>
<p>All MS are doing at this point by releasing yet more shit software is giving web developers a bigger headache. Why can’t they just do everyone a favour and bow out of the browser market? It’s not like it makes them any money, and then I wouldn’t have to take 3 times as long on every website I make trying to get it to work according to MS standards.</p>
<p>I’m going to shut up now, I just needed to get that out.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not only are all of these things wrong, I can’t understand most of them.</p>
<p>I used IE 9 for about 5 minutes, and while I haven’t been able to use it extensively, I have a few comments to make:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can’t go to a new line in a Facebook post. Try it. Try adding a line break. See? You can’t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using tabs in the taskbar is confusing, distracting and unnecessary. Why would you need a whole list of your tabs there when you have them at the top of the window? Further, what happens when you have multiple windows? Do all the tabs just appear in a single list? Or does it differentiate them according to the window they’re in? Even further, what happens when you have a bazillion tabs and want to navigate them quickly? We moved to tabs from windows for a reason; taskbar just seems like a way to bring them back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It took 10 minutes to install. And it had to update. And restart. I mean, seriously? When other browsers take just a minute to install?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can’t work on anything but Windows Vista/7. Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari have now all gone cross-platform, with all but Safari on both Mac and Linux. Further, why on <span class="bbcode-i">earth</span> can’t XP users use IE 9? What was the rationale behind that? That’s only going to turn every XP user away from IE 8 and towards the alternatives. Especially when <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">50%</a> of users still use XP, surely backwards compatibility should be a priority?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <span class="bbcode-i">still</span> doesn’t display some websites right. I maintain a small website, and it still doesn’t get it right. When every single other browser does. Further, I think it misinterprets the conditional comments for other versions of IE and tries to use them too. Please, just shoot me.</p>
</li>

<p>This.</p>
<p>I have no idea what age kids are starting to use the Internet these days, but I don’t see a 6 year old choosing to install Firefox instead of IE on their parents machine.  That said, any “new” browser users have to be the owner/operators of the PCs/MACs in question, thus, it is a conscious switch from one browser to another, as opposed to new Internet users suddenly manifesting and creating a new browser “market”.</p>

<p>Also, about IE losing market share. I’m no statistician but losing a percentage doesn’t neccesarily mean losing users. It’s like this argument about how Windows is losing market share from Apple, even though they are selling more and more copies of Windows and Windows PCs. Meaning Apple are finding a new market rather than stealing Windows users, or possibly, people are still buying a Windows PC alongside their macs (if that’s true its rather hilarious).</p>

<p>That’s true, since when you expand the pie and apportion the new expansion to new consumers of the pie, the original slices are proportionally smaller, but tangibly the same.</p>
<p>However, browsers don’t expand their markets in the same way that Apple and Windows do. Safari might come under this to a limited extent because of the way its tied to Apple, but the reality is that Firefox, Chrome and Opera aren’t finding new users who weren’t previously browsing the internet; they have to get them from somewhere. Obviously there’s a growing trend of new users going directly to FOCS (Firefox/Opera/Chrome/Safari), especially with developments in Europe eliminating the IE monopoly over Windows installations, but logically this can’t account for the dramatic drop in IE usage. Unless every single new internet user used FOCS instead of IE, then there has to be at least a major haemorrhage in IE usage, given that they used to control 90-95% of the market back in the Netscape era.</p>

            <p>Once you leave IE, you can’t go back. I couldn’t stand going back to the buggy, freeze-prone shitbag that IE is.<br>
So I switched to Firefox, and never had these forums freeze my browser ever again.</p>

            <p>I’ve been a big fan of Firefox for a while, but it has some serious memory issues.  Hogging over 500MB to load a couple of pages is outrageous! Then it decided to slow down to a crawl, so I moved to chrome.  My God it’s fast!  I used Opera last about 10 years ago, and found it an unrewarding experience, due to its general lack of support.  I might be tempted to go back if Chrome annoys me enough.</p>

<p>Theyre all pretty crap! - somethings will open in FF and not IE or chrome and vise versa… chrome in my experience seems to break other browsers even after you uninstall it… IE8 on my 64bit 7 machine seems pretty stable and quick enough for me… not sure I’ll be trying 9 just yet…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve never encountered anything that wont load in Firefox/Chrome/Safari. I have, however, encountered many things that don’t work properly in IE, even version 8. Nor have I ever encountered the phenomenon of Chrome breaking other browsers, even on my PC’s.</p>
