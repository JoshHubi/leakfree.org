    <title>Best router for DD-wrt</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/best-router-for-dd-wrt/5215</link>
    <description>I&#39;m planning on buying a router and installing DD-WRT to use as a client bridge. Currently I&#39;m looking at the linksys wrt54g and I&#39;m wondering, will it be powerful enough for gaming? Is there a better router for the same purpose? Or should I just go with the wrt54g?

Help appreciated.</description>

            <p>That’s great; the most my internet gets is around 20 mbs and the most my wireless card ever got when it used to work was 8 mbs. Thanks for the help, I’ll buy theWRT54G then.</p>

            <p>What do you consider “powerful” as regards gaming?  I have Verizon Fios (20mb/5mb), and the ActionTec MI424-V2 sending a signal to the WRT54G as a wireless bridge (with DD-WRT).  When I run <a href="http://Speedtest.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Speedtest.net</a> on the wireless bridged clients, they get 18mb/4mb average.  Not too shabby.  LAN transfers are decent for the setup - about 2.5mB/s.  I don’t game on the bridged clients (that’s just my Windows Home Server and family computer) so I can’t tell you what latency is like, but in short, the WRT54G is a very good platform for DD-WRT (I think it’s one of the most recommended, actually).</p>
<p>Hope that helps  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
