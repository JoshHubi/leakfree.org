    <description>[b]1.[/size][/b] In singleplayer, the &quot;Enable Always Run&quot; option is broken. It&#39;s the same result -- HL2 move style (= separate walk and sprint keys) -- even if you have the option enabled. I guess you decided to keep only the HL2 move style but forgot to remove the &quot;Always Run&quot; option? Elucidate me.

[b]2.[/size][/b] The &quot;Enable Auto-Aim&quot; option is always reseting to ON after I restart the game. Please, fix the bug !!!
Why the hell would someone use auto-aim? We use mouse, not freaking controller o_O I suggest you to remove that option completely (so no Auto-aim in the game at all).

[b]3.[/size][/b] The in-game windows (including options menu; game menu; server browser menu) have a weird bug: [u]The font is broken[/u]. Look here:
[url]https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/46504051217330807/E1F769C0A309090441D26B874FFB7CEA46CCD5AB/[/url]
&gt; the &quot;d&quot; letter is cut at every word (Keyboard, Video, Advanced, Widescreen, so on) in every possible menu / window
&gt; the &quot;a&quot; letter is cut at every word in every possible menu / window
&gt; the &quot;g&quot; letter is cut at every word in every possible menu / window
&gt; the &quot;s&quot; letter is cut at every word in every possible menu / window
&gt; the &quot;q&quot; letter is cut at every word in every possible menu / window
&gt; all numbers are cut in every possible menu / window

Why is this happening? Can you fix this issue, please? The font gets annoying when it&#39;s cut  :frowning:  


 More bug reports will be posted here by me [/size] :bms:</description>

            <p>We’ve read your thread. Just because we haven’t replied yet doesn’t mean we are ignoring your issues. You’re one out of an ocean of many who are reporting things we can improve on. While we try to reply to as many people as possible, time constraints simply render us unable to reply to <span class="bbcode-i">everyone</span> . Internally, we have a list prioritizing all of the issues we are going to fix first.  Your issues are not on that list (yet). As we work through them, we will get to yours and look into fixing them.</p>
<p>Thanks for finding these, we appreciate the effort it took for you to make this post  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">8.</span>[/size] The weapon viewmodel bloodstains are bugged:</p>

<p>they don’t get cleaned when entering water<br>
they randomly get cleaned, when advancing through an area (Or this is intentional ??)<br>
they look low-quality<br>
Can you explain us HOW and WHEN the bloodstains on the weapons get cleaned? Currently, it seems randomly :-\ Also, please look into them and fix any possible bug !!!</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">9.[/size]</span> The ragdolls are clipping through each other (and through physics props). Please, make them solid !!!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">10.[/size]</span> The headcrabs’ and houndeye’s bodies <span class="bbcode-u">cannot be picked up after you killed them</span>. (they are ragdolls, but you cannot pick them up…) In comparison, in the 2012 mod version, you could pick them up.</p>
<p>PLEASE, restore this functionality of picking up dead headcrab and houndeye bodies !!! It’s a cool feature. I wanna “play” with them.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">4.[/size]</span> In singleplayer, when you constantly hit (= keep attack key pressed) an object with the crowbar, your view gets shifted to the right with 180 degrees (then it stops). Look here:<br>
<a href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/46504130691297369/C45D932A7368F3856FC251B1CF42A53B21EB262A/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/46504130691297369/C45D932A7368F3856FC251B1CF42A53B21EB262A/</a><br>
The spark is where I actually hit, but as you see, my screen moves to the right till it makes a complete 180 degree turn o_O</p>
<p>This bug is not present in multiplayer. Only in singleplayer.</p>
<p>PLEASE, fix it !!!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">5.[/size]</span> In multiplayer, when you use the iron-sights for the revolver, the following bugs / problems occur:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the iron-sight view will start in classic mode, even if I have that option disabled. (and after 2 seconds, the iron-sight is back to normal)<br>
when I press again on “mouse 2” to deactivate iron-sights, the weapon won’t go back to normal (Only the zoom goes back to normal).</p>

Please, fix this problem !!!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">6.[/size]</span> The vortiguants often freeze / <span class="bbcode-u">do not move nor attack anymore</span>, in both early and later levels (including the first vortiguant encounter). Really odd. Look here:<br>

Please, fix this immersion breaking problem !!! In the 2012 mod version, the vortiguants don’t have any problem — they always move and attack you non-stop, which is cool.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">7.[/size]</span> When you hit a window / glass with the crowbar, <span class="bbcode-u">only the first hit gets registered by it</span> (= it cracks the glass only on the first hit). If you try to hit the glass again with the crowbar, <span class="bbcode-u">it doesn’t crack anymore</span>. This bug wasn’t present in the 2012 mod version.</p>
<p>Please, fix the bug !!!</p>
