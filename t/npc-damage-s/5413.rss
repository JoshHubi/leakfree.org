    <title>NPC Damage %&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/npc-damage-s/5413</link>
    <description>This is a problem I&#39;ve seen happening too often, ally npc&#39;s dont do the same amount of damage as you do to the enemy or the enemy doesnt do the same amount of damage to you.

Now I get the differential enemy damages based on difficulty settings, but not the friendly npc damages. For instance, and yes i am using hl2&#39;s, the following is for comparison

sk_plr_dmg_357 40
] sk_npc_dmg_357 30
] sk_plr_dmg_alyxgun 5
] sk_npc_dmg_alyxgun 3
] sk_plr_dmg_ar2 8
] sk_npc_dmg_ar2 3
] sk_plr_dmg_buckshot 8
] sk_npc_dmg_buckshot 3
] sk_plr_dmg_crossbow 100
] sk_npc_dmg_crossbow 10
] sk_plr_dmg_crowbar 10
] sk_npc_dmg_crowbar 5
] sk_plr_dmg_pistol 5
] sk_npc_dmg_pistol 3
] sk_plr_dmg_rpg_round 100
] sk_npc_dmg_rpg_round 50
] sk_plr_dmg_smg1 4
] sk_npc_dmg_smg1 3
] sk_plr_dmg_smg1_grenade 100
] sk_npc_dmg_smg1_grenade 50
] sk_plr_dmg_grenade 150
] sk_npc_dmg_grenade 75
] sk_plr_dmg_fraggrenade 125
] sk_npc_dmg_fraggrenade 75
] sk_plr_dmg_grenade 150
] sk_npc_dmg_grenade 75

I find that most of the time, in many games, your ally npc&#39;s will do the same reduced, damage as your enemy npc&#39;s, same applies for half-life games as well, so the argument of gordon is wearing a suit cannot come into play because the npc&#39;s are shooting at each other as well.

I am on the basis of, yes sure let the enemies do reduced damage to player based on the difficulty concept of gaming, but do not have that concept apply to them fighting each other, If I have an ally npc I want them to not be worthless in a fight otherwise theres no point to having them carry weapons, in my opinion,

In another side note contributing to this, i&#39;ve always hated the difficulty settings for the most part, I have pretty much thought that the hardest difficulty should be named normal,
easy
medium
hard
normal-the way it really would&#39;ve gone down-could apply it to hard but either way.

I&#39;ve found a way to bring up the npc damages to be on par with you without destroying the game entirely for the hl2&#39;s, just because im so anal about it and the idea that my friends and enemies weapons should do about same or differential damages based on armour and so on, but since its already applied to the player, it needs to be fixed on the npc&#39;s end towards each other,

for example if a marine or a combine throws a grenade at me and some civies, of course damage done to me would be less, but the same amount of damage should not be recieved by civies because they themselves are not in hazard suits.

and will the guards be ungimped in their combat effectiveness, now I know that they are not trained soldiers, but come on some security guards even in real life are former soldiers,

as for the stay put commands and follow, I&#39;ve always liked the idea of move to where my crosshairs are for my npc, allies without it having to affect an entire group but effeciently, but if it does effect them as a group they should take cover effecively or move to different spots effectively, kinda like starwars republic commando that was efficient squad control if there ever was one,

will there be anything to deal with this in the mod or is this just wishfull thinking</description>

            <p>^ Valve kind’ve broke the Autoexec.cfg when they patched the engine for HL2 (Just Half-Life 2, episodes work fine)</p>
<p>It won’t load any custom configuration files anymore on start up. You have to prompt it to load them. As a result it will only use the stock ones on start up, and I ain’t got a clue how to get around them.</p>
<p>Edit: Last week post. I need to sleep more…</p>

<p>Yeah I’ve already done that for the hl2’s, I’m going to do it for black mesa as well. I just wish that the autoconfig thing that I’ve been reading forums on and following instructions for just worked, on its own instead of me having to assign a button to activate it during every new game load and level load.  if anyone can give me a link to where I can fix that problem (to not have to assign the button and it’ll activate during everyload) I’d really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Oh yes as for alyx, her weapon(alyx gun is 5 dmg, wish she would actually do that dmg, she is actually doing 3 dmg,<br>
sk_npc_dmg_alyxgun 3<br>
it would make more sense if she really did do the 5, logically speaking of course.<br>
but thanks for the discussion guys</p>

<p>well, the point is not for them to do all the work for me, Its so that I dont do all the work for them, I just hate it when a game is made and you have allies around you and they cant kill or fight worth shit, I dont ask for OP allies I just ask for decent ones, ones that are efficient but not overly efficient, if none of the criteria is met, I change it to meet the criteria. I just dont like it when combat npc’s are in the game and they are totally worthless, but I will make the npc meet my criteria when this does come out. I’ve been able to do it without destroying the balance. But thanks for the response anyway.</p>

            <p>This is a problem I’ve seen happening too often, ally npc’s dont do the same amount of damage as you do to the enemy or the enemy doesnt do the same amount of damage to you.</p>
<p>Now I get the differential enemy damages based on difficulty settings, but not the friendly npc damages. For instance, and yes i am using hl2’s, the following is for comparison</p>
<p>sk_plr_dmg_357 40<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_357 30<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_alyxgun 5<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_alyxgun 3<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_ar2 8<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_ar2 3<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_buckshot 8<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_buckshot 3<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_crossbow 100<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_crossbow 10<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_crowbar 10<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_crowbar 5<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_pistol 5<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_pistol 3<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_rpg_round 100<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_rpg_round 50<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_smg1 4<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_smg1 3<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_smg1_grenade 100<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_smg1_grenade 50<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_grenade 150<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_grenade 75<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_fraggrenade 125<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_fraggrenade 75<br>
] sk_plr_dmg_grenade 150<br>
] sk_npc_dmg_grenade 75</p>
<p>I find that most of the time, in many games, your ally npc’s will do the same reduced, damage as your enemy npc’s, same applies for half-life games as well, so the argument of gordon is wearing a suit cannot come into play because the npc’s are shooting at each other as well.</p>
<p>I am on the basis of, yes sure let the enemies do reduced damage to player based on the difficulty concept of gaming, but do not have that concept apply to them fighting each other, If I have an ally npc I want them to not be worthless in a fight otherwise theres no point to having them carry weapons, in my opinion,</p>
<p>In another side note contributing to this, i’ve always hated the difficulty settings for the most part, I have pretty much thought that the hardest difficulty should be named normal,<br>
easy<br>
medium<br>
hard<br>
normal-the way it really would’ve gone down-could apply it to hard but either way.</p>
<p>I’ve found a way to bring up the npc damages to be on par with you without destroying the game entirely for the hl2’s, just because im so anal about it and the idea that my friends and enemies weapons should do about same or differential damages based on armour and so on, but since its already applied to the player, it needs to be fixed on the npc’s end towards each other,</p>
<p>for example if a marine or a combine throws a grenade at me and some civies, of course damage done to me would be less, but the same amount of damage should not be recieved by civies because they themselves are not in hazard suits.</p>
<p>and will the guards be ungimped in their combat effectiveness, now I know that they are not trained soldiers, but come on some security guards even in real life are former soldiers,</p>
<p>as for the stay put commands and follow, I’ve always liked the idea of move to where my crosshairs are for my npc, allies without it having to affect an entire group but effeciently, but if it does effect them as a group they should take cover effecively or move to different spots effectively, kinda like starwars republic commando that was efficient squad control if there ever was one,</p>
<p>will there be anything to deal with this in the mod or is this just wishfull thinking</p>
