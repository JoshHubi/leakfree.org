    <description>Here is a [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c9jZFSky1Y&amp;feature=player_detailpage&#39;]video[/url]. You just can stand there relaxing and headcrabs will never hit you. Is this intended behaviour or exploit? :hmph:</description>

            <p>the movement of the headcrabs is definitely buggy here. i’ve had no problems whatsoever with the game until i got to this point. they were jerking all around the platform, i took quite a few hit because the would literally teleport from one place to the other, there was no way to follow their movement.</p>

            <p>I too had buggy headcrabs and took damage because of it, but I didn’t really mind it in this section because of the circumstances. (Stuck in a confined space/Paying attention to where I need to jump off to get to the ‘secret’ security office.)</p>

            <p>Just going to second that, headcrab movement on that elevator is rather erratic. It couldn’t get through that part without taking a lot of damage because I couldn’t kill the headcrabs before they could hit me. I guess it is supposed to be a bit of a challenge though.</p>

            <p>Nah their movement was a bit buggy and choppy on my end too, and my computer is far from old. Hardly a game-breaking bug, though.</p>

            <p>I didn’t try to avoid the headcrabs but their movement was kinda buggy while on the elevator, it was probably due to my computer being too old.</p>

            <p>Interesting. I didn’t intend for that to be possible, so I’ll fix it for the first patch.</p>
