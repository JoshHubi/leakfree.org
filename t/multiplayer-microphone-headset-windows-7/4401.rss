    <title>Multiplayer - Microphone/Headset - Windows 7</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multiplayer-microphone-headset-windows-7/4401</link>
    <description>It WAS working fine, but sometime in the last month or so, (Or maybe since I hooked up my recording microphone?) my headset microphone is not working in counter strike source or team fortress classic. My problem is that I don&#39;t understand how windows 7 works with the audio settings.

In game when I &quot;test microphone&quot; the bar does not move as I talk. So I am assuming it is something in the puter audio settings.

I am using the onboard Realtek AC&#39;97 Audio sound.
My speakers are Creative speakers that have two jacks on the front of them for the headset (mic and ears).  (Yes it worked before, but now it isnt)

I also have an M-Audio Delta plugged in for times where I need to do recording work.

Are any of these settings wrong? I have no idea what they do or how to check or what I am looking at!   HALP!

<p>not sure what is Line Volume</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>“Line volume” refers to a jack on some sound cards where you have a “line in” port.  You use a “line in” jack for if you have an amplified sound source such as a keyboard or something.  A mic isn’t amplified so using a mic on a line in jack will result in an extremely weak signal going to the sound card.  Plug an amplified signal into the mic jack and you’ll get distortion.</p>
<p>Right now, I’ve my computer hooked with a wire going from the sound card’s “Audio Out” jack into the “Line In” jack on my stereo.  Works like a charm.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I have looked EVERYWHERE for what you posted in that pic, but I cant find it in windows 7. I think it was replaced with what I posted.  gah!  I am familiar with your pic. I am NOT familiar with my pics.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will have a go at it. thx.</p>

</aside>
<p>Catz, under the second picture you posted choose the Microphone option (Realtek AC’97 Audio - Ready) and choose the button Set Default. If this doesn’t work for you let us know and I’ll reactivate my onboard audio and do some troubleshooting for you. (I run an M-Audio Delta 1010Lt so my audio setup is similar to yours.)</p>
<p>Oh, and long time lurker first time poster. Hello all!</p>
<p>Edit: :ninja: fix’d</p>

            <p>In image Clipboard02.jpg, have you tried selecting the “Microphone” option?</p>
<p>EDIT: try every other option on that tab too.</p>
<p>EDIT2: You would probably need to click “Set Default” after selecting. I’m just talking blindly because I don’t have Win7 so I can’t test it myself.</p>
<p>Also, if it doesn’t work, try clicking “Configure” and find something like this:</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Make sure the “Mic Volume” is selected. Of course, again, if it doesn’t work try the other two options (although I doubt it would be Stereo Mix as it is an option for recording the sound that comes out of your speakers; not sure what is Line Volume).</p>
