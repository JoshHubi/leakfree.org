    <title>Windows 7 64 bit, was any testing performed at all?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-7-64-bit-was-any-testing-performed-at-all/10661</link>
    <description>Really guys, it looks like your QA team missed that one :slight_smile: 
NONE of the installers worked, I got it running after manually compiling files from 5! different archives, including the cracked ones. With the exeption of some missing models, which is easily fixable, it&#39;s seems fine.</description>

<p>I think from the replies in this thread we can safely conclude that you’re doing something wrong.  Since you have given almost no details about what options you have chosen during install, what errors the installer gave you, what exactly happened, what you had to do specifically to get it working, I will close this thread since nothing else is here to discuss.</p>
<p>If you want to provide additional information about your system and what happened during the initial install, please open a new thread/bug report.</p>

            <p>All you people with CRC check errors have either overclocked too much or have some other stability issue on your PC. I downloaded it as soon as it came out and extracted it fine the 1st time, even though I had 1 bars on WIFI and the download kept stalling due to too many requests.</p>

            <p>I had trouble downloading BMS. I got checksum errors several times and the torrent client downloaded almost 500MB of waste, due to checksum errors, but once the file was completed after a long painful waiting time, the installer worked perfectly on my Win7 64Bit System. Maybe start it in admin mode or from different directory (you know, all those security regulations in Win7 might interfere)?</p>
