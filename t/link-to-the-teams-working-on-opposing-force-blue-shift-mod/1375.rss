    <title>Link to the teams working on Opposing Force / Blue Shift mod?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/link-to-the-teams-working-on-opposing-force-blue-shift-mod/1375</link>
    <description>Hi, This time i was smart to read the FAQ before im posting anything. Unlike as i did in the Killing Floor forums when i got kicked for saying that the frying pan was a genius idea of valve for Left for Dead 2... well that is truly another story. What i want to ask is if there is websites for the teams working on the Opposing Force and Blue Shift remakes? i read in the FAq that there is teams behind this, and Black Mesa Modification Team dont have anything to do with it. For that reason i wont ask if there will be a Opposing Force / Blue Shift mod From BMS-team, as i was about to do before i read the FAQ. anyways, The link to these teams working on Opposing Force/Blue Shift &quot;Source&quot;, or whatever the name is. If there is a link ie.

Thank You</description>

<p>And Thats WHY. Thats why i carefully wrote that i KNOW that BMS team isnt planning to do such a thing! and why not ask about a mod of the expansion of Half-Life 1 Here? in the Half-Life series… without getting flamed of nerdish “i are only pleing blak mesa sours, all oder modds is shiit!” just because a guy 2 weeks ago asked the same thing?</p>

<p>In Fact, BMS IS the biggest mod in source so far! BUT i didnt say its the greatest! maybe thats why im asking for a mod of OP or BS? Portal Prelude is the awsomest freaking MOD! so whats up next, people flame me because im not adoring BMS as the greatest mod in the history of FPS. And people flame me because I AM. Jesus christ.</p>

<p>Hey thanks. But why are the guys being such a jackasses to that guy who posted the links. =P he did a right thing. Even though Black Mesa Source surely is the biggest mod in source ever, people are still allowed to make mods even though they dont have a website. anyways thanks =D</p>
