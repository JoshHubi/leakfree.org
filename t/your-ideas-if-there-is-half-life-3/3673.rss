</aside>
<p>well, either your a douchebag or you are a complete moron, because the stupidity that is just constantly being spilled out of your account is nigh unprecedented. I will assume that you are an amature troll and not a complete moron because I don’t think it is possible to be honestly as stuipd and immature as you have been, lately.</p>
<p>please go back to troll school and brush up on your tactics, they are embarrasing.</p>
<p>EDIT: ON TOPIC: Episode three will almost certainly be in arctic territory, and I expect we will not be seeing many headcrabs or any aliens that we are used to, with the exception of combine.</p>

<p>Well, I know it’s not perfect, but it’s the best summary of the entire story I could find. Do you know of any better ones? If there’s a more correct one I’d like to know for future reference.</p>

<p>All the times I played HL I just figured all the creatures were just from the xen dimension…I never knew aliens were involved.  No wonder the combine seemed so out of place to me lol.  Regardless, I wish there was more variation to the combine, I guess repetition and little variation are my only complaints.  Whats the explanation behind the ant lions?  When did this become starship troopers, HL2 is still set on earth right?</p>
<p>The Vorts do rule, I agree.  I just prefer fighting them, I thought they made an excellent foe lol.</p>
<p>I also agree that valve shouldn’t have just remade HL, it was sensible to be finished with BM.  I know I am not very creative and wouldn’t come up with a good plot, I simply didn’t get where the alien plot line came from until you mentioned their inclusion in HL1.</p>
<p>Id really like to know EXACTLY where the R.C. sample came from…or have they already answered that? lol</p>

<p>First of all, aliens were always involved. You killed alien wildlife and soldiers in Black Mesa, and more alien wildlife and an alien overlord on Xen.</p>
<p>Second, the vorts rule.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Third, Valve had to take a new direction with HL2, whatever it might be and however people recieved it. The ending makes it clear you’re done with Black Mesa and going on to new things. Besides, just making HL1 over again wouldn’t be fun or interesting for the devs or the players. Oh…wait…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>/slight rant<br>
I also did not like the turn HL2 took with the story, I just thought involving aliens was a poor decision. I would not have minded if they were written in and implemented better, than again I only played the episodes once and really didn’t pay too much attention. I kind of lost interest in the story and I know the time waiting between episodes didn’t help; I didn’t find much replay value in the episodes. Oh and I hate how the vortigaunts are now allies.</p>
<p>Maybe the HL1 story is too awesome to contend with…and difficult to continue.</p>

<p>First of all, aliens were always involved. You killed alien wildlife and soldiers in Black Mesa, and more alien wildlife and an alien overlord on Xen.</p>
<p>Second, the vorts rule.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Third, Valve had to take a new direction with HL2, whatever it might be and however people recieved it. The ending makes it clear you’re done with Black Mesa and going on to new things. Besides, just making HL1 over again wouldn’t be fun or interesting for the devs or the players. Oh…wait…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Doom300 is just a douche-bag and immediately steered this thread towards retarded…</p>
<p>I do hope the HL3 engine implements 100% destructive environments, realistic physics/ragdolling, real-time lighting, different gibbing/gore (but not l4d over the top), improved character damage reaction (limping, independent limb damage).  I personally have no speculations on what will happen in HL3, I just hope it doesn’t involve combine and antlions, perhaps my least favorite enemies…ever lol.</p>

<p>BTW, when he said “The Garry I created!” he meant the guy from his closet wearing clown mask, the one that appears in his dreams and giving him candy!</p>
