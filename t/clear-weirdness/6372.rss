    <title>CLEAR weirdness</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/clear-weirdness/6372</link>
    <description>So a couple of days ago my Clear internet started getting really low speeds - like .6M down when I should be getting about 6M down. So I saw on the Clear site some people were complaining about this, and I added my case to the thread. Now tonight I check on speedtest.net, and my ping has shot up to the mid 200s, but my down speed is between 10 to 13M. Interestingly, throughout all this, my up speed remained constant at about 1M. 

Anyone else use Clear and have this happen? Anyone have any idea what&#39;s going on?</description>

            <p>I use ClearWire here in Belgium and all I can tell you is that they suck big time. Already given up on that company long time ago.</p>

<p>I had a helium balloon in my room a few years ago, I turned around and it vanished. No sound, all doors/windows were closed and I never found it. I was like “that’s CLEAR weirdness”</p>
<p>Anyway I use Sympatico and only my torrents are throttled(sometimes) but I hear a in the US most people use Comcast or Verizon, and both are heavily throttled during certain hours, with ping increase up to 300ms, ouch.</p>

<p>Lol that is pretty weird, actually.</p>
<p>Anyway, the high ping seems to have been related to the server I was testing to on speedtest. I went back and tried some other servers and my ping was back to normal and I still had great speed.</p>
<p>Maybe it <span class="bbcode-i">was</span> being throttled for some reason. I was a couple hours late on my last payment because I closed the bank account that I was paying for my service with and forgot to update my payment info…but that would be really dickish, even for an ISP. I did download a couple torrents right before that, but they weren’t even that large, only about a gig each. So, seeing as how other people were complaining about it at the time, I’m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was maintenance or some such. They’ve been pretty good for me so far, hoping this was just a one-off and not something that’s gonna keep happening.</p>
