    <title>Unlock LAN Securities</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unlock-lan-securities/6989</link>
    <description>I often times want to take something off my computer from another computer on the network. But I have to go through shared and public folders which is annoying as hell. So I&#39;ve looked everywhere in setting and unlocked any security I could find that might do it, but it still won&#39;t let me access my hard drive from another computer. Does anyone know what I should do to unlock it? 

And I don&#39;t give shit about dangers or anything like that.</description>

            <p>Or you could just try the admin shares…</p>
<p>I.e. if you’re on ComputerName1, and you want to access the D drive on the machine FileBox, open My Computer in ComputerName1, go to the address bar and type \Filebox\D$ - it should prompt you for a user and pass (which you’ll need matching accounts on both machines, if memory serves me).  The $ tells Windows to access the remote admin shares.</p>

            <p>Run command prompt as an administrator (in the Windows 7 search box, type in “cmd” and then right click on the file that comes up and click “Run as Administrator”). In the black window that comes up, type in “takeown /f DIRECTORY”, but replace the word DIRECTORY with the actual directory you want to share (like C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop, for example. But put the directory in quotes if there are any spaces in it, like in “C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts”). Note that you need to be under an administrator account to do all of this, and it might not work with subdirectories; you’ll have to do the same to them manually.</p>
<p>THEN try to share the directory you just took ownership of.</p>

<p>I should mention that there are some folders that cannot be shared due to local ntfs permissions, that’s why I always use Administrator as my primary user account even in Win7. Because fuck you Microsoft and your limited administrator accounts.</p>
<p>So I just got my hands on a windows 7 machine and here’s how you do it. Right click on folder, choose Share With, “Specific People”, then in the drop box choose everyone and click Add.</p>

<p>Well, I guess I just can’t share my Local disk even though it says I can.<br>
So I did what you said with some other folders and it kept saying could not share folder. So I check from another computer, and it was sharing all those folders it said it couldn’t.</p>
<p>So it doesn’t share what it says it can share and then it does share what is says it can’t share. Brilliant.</p>
<p>Thanks Sersoft.</p>

<p>like I said, go to network n sharing and find the option that says enable password protected sharing and put it to off, and make sure you add everyone to the read permission</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I swear I’ve done exactly that. I’ve pretty much rooted through all the network settings and turned off anything that looks like it could be the problem.</p>

            <p>I’ve done that, and it seems like it should work. But in the network it says it’s shared but when I try and access it it says some shit about not having permissions.</p>

            <p>I’m not running w7 right now, but to share folders in it (after going through the options in network n sharing center) right click on folder you want to share, find where it shows your username and add “everyone” to the list.</p>
