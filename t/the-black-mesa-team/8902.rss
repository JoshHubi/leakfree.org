    <description>How many of you guys think the Black Mesa Dev Team will be one of those teams that get contacted by Valve after their mod does really well and will be offered jobs to work on Half-Portal 2?</description>

            <p>No, there are regulars here who also don’t care about the mod anymore, they just don’t act like douchebags about it. We don’t care about what people think, we care how they talk to us about it. You can have a different opinion about the mod here but as long as you don’t act like a crazy street preacher about it we don’t really care.</p>

<p>What’s with people like you coming here and shoving your baseless and uninformed assumptions at us in an attempt for us to “see the light” or something? Does it affect you personally if people here believe that the mod will still release? Why do you care and why do you always dodge these questions?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, that is pretty much it.<br>
No, it doesn’t really affect me personally. That’s not why I register on forums in the first place. I just wanted to know if anyone else thought what I did, which seems to be taboo here.<br>
I hope I answered your questions there. Your post and maybe one other are the only ones that actually deserved an answer.</p>
<p>I’m surprised at how there’s either their way or the highway. You either believe they are going to succeed immensely, or you’re a troll. I’m guessing there’s a lot of hopeful teenagers around here, based on the idiotic way they behave.</p>

            <p>many members of the team have jobs already (both in and out of the gaming industry) and I would venture to say they wouldn’t be interested in taking a job at Valve as this mod is a (very intense) hobby. I know at least Ram has said as much before.</p>

            <p>I believe that it’s a possibility, I also believe that this mod /is/ going on Steam Works (so long as the developers agree to that) but most of all I believe this experience really puts their portfolio’s out there, that’s what will get them a job (anywhere), a portfolio that no one can say no too.</p>

            <p>I want to offer them a job now. And seeing as they aren’t getting paid for this project I’ll offer a starting wage of a $1.25 an hour.</p>
<p>What do ya say Ram? Want to work for me on video games?! I have some ideas backlogged. But I expect better quality work than what you’re doing currently.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to run the forums I set up…</p>

            <p>It is so obvious how new some of you are. Back in the day no one would have tried to converse with mahogany like an equal.</p>
<p>You see children, these little creatures are not like us. They are here for our enjoyment and amusement. It’s okay for you to keep them as pets, but don’t ever forget that we are superior to them.</p>

<p>Seing as it probably never will be released, I have my doubts. But I love that there’s still gossiping about it, and that the developers are communicating with the fans.</p>

<p>I’m a “troll” if I don’t believe it’s going to be released? What does it tell you, when they released a teaser/trailer/whatever with “2009” on it? It’s 2012, and still nowhere release.<br>
Actually, if they postpone it much longer, it will be out of date and probably very uninteresting to most people.<br>
The signs are so obvious, yet you call me a troll. Yes, I registered just because there has been some fuss recently about the mod, and saw that there actually was activity on the forums. I feel obliged to try to get you to be realistic. I was looking forward to this mod in 2008, but now I don’t care much.</p>

<p>What’s with people like you coming here and shoving your baseless and uninformed assumptions at us in an attempt for us to “see the light” or something? Does it affect you personally if people here believe that the mod will still release?</p>
<p>Why do you care and why do you always dodge these questions?</p>

            <p>I’m thinking Black Mesa will so extremely great that the black mesa dev team will hire Valve for future projects.</p>
