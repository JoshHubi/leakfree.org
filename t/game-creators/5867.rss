    <description>A friend of mine wants to make a game (or two) but he can&#39;t find a good program to do it with. I don&#39;t know any good ones either. He will pay for them, and he doesn&#39;t care if it&#39;s free.

He is doing a 3D environment, but he will try a 2D if there is a good, easy to use, free program that you can create it with.

He has Windows 7, so it has to be compatible with that. Otherwise, it will just take up space until he gets rid of it.

He doesn&#39;t want to make a mod of anything.

Any suggestions?</description>

            <p>Looks like its gonna be a good game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>At the rate we are going, we might get several of these suggestions, just to see what will work to what he wants. I don’t actually know what his idea is exactly, but it is probably going to be first person or like yours, just to start.</p>
<p>I am just in charge of the story behind it, dialog, voice acting(if it is needed) and that stuff. I am actually not taking part in the actual creation part. He is the sole developer. I am just his lackey XD</p>

<p>No, it’s not just me. I  am the story behind his idea, not the tech. Why screw it? And why the sudden burst of rage?</p>
<p>Thank you, I will tell him that the Unreal engine has been recommended, several times now, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I couldn’t give less of a damn about creating a game, even if I tried. I just like to make the stories behind the face of the art.</p>

            <p>Yeah. there are some disadvantages to it… I looked at it after he downloaded it, and it didn’t look easy to use. That could be me. Also, You don’t get much unless you get the pro version. But since he is just testing ideas, that is ok…</p>

<p>I’ve been lurking this particular thread and the Unity site and it’s sounding really good… almost too good. Are there any actual disadvantages to it?</p>

I don’t know how is the situation now, but I think you will need to pirate it because the English version is not legal.</p>

<p>Having a school e-mail and being enrolled at college gives you some major advantages for utilization of some programs you feel like tinkering around with… for free. Autodesk are the makers of Maya, and yes; that’s available for your use. For free.</p>

            <p>Actionscript is super duper easy. Provided your friend doesn’t suck at Flash, he can have a decent platformer going in under an hour.</p>
<p>Upload it to Newgrounds with an ad in the preloader and make a few bucks + there’s potentially hundreds of thousands of unique players</p>

            <p>well 2D you can always go back to flash. There are some powerful actionscript engines out there plus seeing as it’s flash you get a quick return on investment. Plus x-browser &amp; x-platform.</p>
<p>Down side of this is that the knowledge gained doesn’t translate too well to a 3d engine. (with the exception of some programming styles or routines)</p>

<p>Either a program like Gamer Maker or he will need programming skills for an engine like torque-2d ( <a href="https://www.torquepowered.com/products/torque-2d" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.torquepowered.com/products/torque-2d</a> ).</p>
<p>Depends how well is skills are and his ability to adapt and learn.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>we both adapt and learn very well. we don’t have much in the way of programming skills.</p>

<p>If he could learn DarkBasic, that would be a good start. It’s a powerful, yet simple coding program that contains a 3D engine. Not sure if that’s what he’s looking for though. Does he want a really simplified ‘game maker’ or a full out coding utility?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Simple to use at first. He just wants to start with testing, not a full out attempt.</p>

<p>he could use the good old quake 3 engine, afaik it’s free</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He could, but then he would end up wasting more time making it a 2d system rather then using an existing 2d engine.</p>

            <p>He can write his own engine, use an existing one, or adapt an existing one.</p>
<p>There’s supposedly some really slick freeware engines that come with easy-to-use interfaces and everything, but I wouldn’t know where to find those.</p>
