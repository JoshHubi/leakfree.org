    <title>White Line Splits my Screen Diagonally</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/white-line-splits-my-screen-diagonally/11740</link>
    <description>When I play, there is a white line that splits my screen in half diagonally. This happens instead of the crosshair showing. This could be related to some missing textures. I would like to reinstall as a last resort, it took almost half an hour on the first install (though I wasn&#39;t torrenting...). Please help.</description>

            <p>No, that was me setting the DirectX version to 8, thinking it would give me a performance boost like it did in TF2. Thanks for the info.</p>

            <p>Directx issue:</p>
<p>Your pc has installed an old version of directx.</p>
<p>Check if your GPU supports directx 9.0, if yes download it.</p>
<p>If no try to uncheck the post processing on the hud, the bloom fx and lower the graphical settings (for instance HDR antialiasing etc… )</p>
<p>If you google your problem, you’ll find that is quite common, especially with SFM.<br>
I’m sure that if here you won’t find a solution, something will pop-in with a simple search.</p>
