    <description>I`m stuck here. Do I have to do anything special to get the door to open?

Instead of going right, look right ahead.  There’s a small door (you’ll see two locked bulkhead doors to the left).  Inside is another super-zapper, as well as a fire button that shoots snarks.

<p>I’m don’t remember if it counted toward that or not, but there’s one bit where the path forward goes to the right, but you can also go left and up some stairs to an observation room over a lab with another tesla thingy in it.  Activating it once breaks some glass tubes and releases some large, nasty-looking aliens, and some marines run in to fight them (when I did it, the marines got slaughtered).

<p>I tried that one, didn’t work. Also, I forgot to mention, I tried the one where you shoot the snarks, the tesla coil breaks and it doesn’t count as part of the achievement. I noclipped in there and the wall texture at the window is there which leads me to believe there’s some way to get in there, but there’s no buttons or anything inside.</p>
<p>Ah… I didn’t know about that, thanks for the info.</p>

            <p>I thought it was going to get stuck there at first.  The scientist walked up to the panel and just stood there.</p>
<p>I paused the game and Alt+Tab’d out to IRC for a few minutes, and when I unpaused it, he opened the door.  <em>shrug</em></p>

            <p>I’m trying to get the Ethically Questionable achievement, I completed four of the experiments and I can’t find the other one. Here’s what I believe I have done:</p>
<p>-Killing the alien grunt with poisonous gas<br>
-Using the tesla discharge on the bullsquid.<br>
-Using poisonous gas on the headcrabs in their habitat<br>
-Shooting the headcrabs with the lazer</p>
<p>What’s the other one? I’ve looked everywhere and can’t find it.</p>
<p>PS: I spell it lazer because if you say laser how it’s spelled, it doesn’t sound like it’s supposed to.</p>

            <p>The scientist walked up to the door in my case, but didn’t open it.<br>
I pressed Use (E) on both him and the door, and then he did it. Wish he didn’t though.</p>

            <p>You’re in the room with all those hounds right? On top of the shelve in the corner there are 3 grenades. You can get to them by jumping up on the forklift. Pick them up and throw them at the switch on the other side of the fence. That destroys the switch and turns off the power</p>

            <p>I cannot figure out how to get over the electric fence. If I recall from HL1, you stack items to be able to jump, but the only thing I seem to have available for stacking is the ladder, which doesn’t get me high enough.</p>
<p>I’m probably missing something easy… any ideas?</p>

            <p>I had to redo Questionable Ethics for this same reason. The second time I didn’t wait around for them to have the pity party before the surgical room and ran right ahead waiting for them to follow. Not sure if that made the difference, but one of the scientists walked up the ramp to let me through that time.</p>

            <p>Currently seem to be stuck in Questionable Ethics… I’ve saved the 3 scientists from the room of unspeakable medical horrors. With a Guard in tow I follow the Scientists towards I assume the exit of the facility but as we get to some sort of security airlock they stop and start talking about this being “too easy” and asking me to go look ahead. “Ahead” however consists of 20 feet of hallway ending abruptly with a large locked security door. There does not appear to be any way to pass. There’s a console on the wall next to the door but it can’t be interacted with. I’ve backtracked but most of the previous level is not blocked off. No idea what to do here.</p>

            <p>Just press the button till it stops I guess… It combines 2 awesome things, shooting living things from an air cannon and pressing buttons, what more could you want?</p>
<p>And now I have to go back and do this… good thing I wasn’t too far into QE.</p>
