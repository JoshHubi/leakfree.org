            <p>Considering that the Catholic church has been trying to modernise itself recently, this seems like a logical move for them. At least they’re not stuck in the dark ages like some religions.</p>

<p>Exactly. Just because some of my friends are vegetarian doesn’t mean that I am going to shove a slab of steak in their face and force feed them, or that they will strip my fridge of all meat products. Coexist, muthafuckas.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little to pesemistic, but yes, more or less. There is a very very high chance that there’s other life and other intelligent life but we’re never gonna find it unless there’s some tiny bits of bacteria or something unimportant somewhere near us.</p>
<p>We’re never gonna get the technology to go anywhere out of our solar system. Even if it is possible to achieve that technology mankind will never be around long enough to discover it.</p>

<p>Science doesn’t either.  Explain why the Big Bang happened?  Where did the ball of mass come from if there was nothing before it?</p>
<p>On to life, where did the first cell come from?  If you answer that it formed in the primordial soup filled with organic molecules, what gave that first cell the will to thrive and survive, however small that will was?</p>
<p>Can quarks be further broken down?  What are these smaller molecules?</p>
<p>Sure, there are theories to explain these things.  But, then again, religion has theories too, except they are called beliefs.</p>
<p>In the beginning, evolution was a theory that could get you lynched.  Guess who Darwin was.  A very religious man.  Go figure.</p>

Both overlap and coexist in a balanced world, and if we didn’t have this sharp line drawn maybe we could allow them to and finally see what may have alluded our eyes thus far.</p>

<p>I don’t really believe in a true “heaven,” either.  It’s where I incorporate a sort of Buddhist belief.  I believe in a sort of “spirit hub” where all spirits are drawn to after death.  It is within this hub that the spirits are pure and may remember all of its past lives.  However, they must be recycled at some point to mortal shells to keep the wheel turning.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>IMO: religion.<br>
I don’t know what the websters definition of religion is and I don’t care, so don’t qoute it. I said IMO.</p>
<p>The difference is mainstream religions such as Christianity CLAIM they know everything, science admits that there are things we don’t know. And most people when they have a “belief” they treat there beliefs as facts and if you asked them they would say they are facts.</p>
<p>I don’t think anything I say is a fact, but I believe it strongly enough that I will risk eternal damnation on it.</p>
<p>Also, I hope you don’t get too frustrated with me, to tell you the truth, I quite enjoy arguing, I see it as a game or a sport, so lets both try to keep this from degrading into a flame war.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s human nature to argue your point if you think you are right. I fell I’m right and religion is wrong, thus I argue that point.</p>
<p>Feynmen is a genius too, and far far from religious. I admit I really don’t know too much about Einstein and I guess I really can’t say anything about his upbringing, but I can say that Religion and science are opposites, they don’t coexist. Science seeks to explain as much as possible using thought, religion seeks to explain things using what sounds pretty/justifies your actions/makes you fell important/just about anything that appeals to emotions and not logic. I’m speaking generally so it may not be completely true for all of religion, but I know it is somewhat true for your brand of religion.</p>

<p>I know but that’s a different issue, its got nothing to do with trying to find extraterrestrial life, for the most part. And I agree that space colonization/exploration isn’t worth the cost at this point.</p>

<p>We are spending billions on spaceships unmanned and manned. (definitely not entirely a waste of money but still not worth the enormous amount of money we pour into it)</p>

<p>Why not?</p>
<p>If they ever did find anything at all they’d twist it in to some sort of stupid religious proof or argument.</p>
<p>BTW, there should be no extraterrestial race, I think we need to worry more about our economy, starvation, cancer and over population long long before we start pumping billions into searching for life that we won’t find.</p>

<p>This.</p>
<p>Throughout their entire “conference” I doubt the talked much about actually sending probes in search of life or doing much more than looking through telescopes they were already looking for. This conference’s purpose was mostly likely a preemptive strike to try to prevent themselves from looking like complete dumbasses if somebody did find aliens.</p>
<p>Science and religion can never mix, Even though Science doesn’t directly contradict religion they don’t go together; science is evidence, experiments, logic and reason, religion is archaic books/traditions and faith (belief without reason).</p>

            <p>Religion and science…not really something that mixes well…personally I’m not a religious person. While I do believe anything is possible… I think it’s going to be some time before we come up with any conclusive evidence that points to aliens. Give it a few more thousand years and we’ll find them. We just need proper technology to leave our solar system.</p>
