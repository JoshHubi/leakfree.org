    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-do-i-replace-some-sound/15208</link>
    <description>[b]I want some sound effect from HL1 to be in this game eg. Med Kit picking sound, Opening weapon hud sound etc. I already have HL1 sounds what should I do ? I have no experience about modding. Anyone has a guide for doing this  ? In workshop there aren&#39;t everything I want so I decide to create what myself.[/b]
[b]I don&#39;t want to create an advance mod such as texture but only sound replacing.
