            <p>Folks, if I could suggest a great book on ADD, it is called “Driven to Distraction”. It goes over what ADD and ADHD are, and some of the markers that one should look for if they think they may have it.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate, that ADD and ADHD have become a catch phrase for anyone with a fast mind, or for a kid with a behavior issues - Lots of youth have been given Ritalin, or Dexedrine, when what they needed was more involvement with their parents doing things together. A bit of discipline, and time blowing off some pent up energy doing whatever. Diet does play a role also, but that is here or there.</p>
<p>A high achieving student, suddenly having his marks plummet, does NOT qualify for ADD, if there was not former, long haul symptoms. (As obvious as that seems, some have been prescribed meds they should have never been on.</p>
<p>There are many things that can be a factor in mimic behavior of ADD, as we go through various stages/situations/stresses/nutrition available though life. Again my friends, it is the long haul history of the various markers that are important to pay attention to.</p>
<p>(Bolteh, no worries about the comment brother - it would have been perfectly appropriate if I was saying was what you first thought I was saying. (perhaps I should have made the rapid switch thing more apparent, and not a one off bracket) There is a lot of banana oil that gets shuffled around the net and it is good for folks to call people on BS. Cheers)</p>

You lost the best part and kept the worst? WTH!</p>
<p>You still might not have ADD, because I don’t, I guess. I read an article that said that human intelligence can be separated into, IIRC, 8 kinds of intelligence. One of them is logic, another is social intelligence. I think that I just have the former above the average and the latter below the average. Maybe you have a similar problem. IMO, not a big deal, though, if you learn to live with it.</p>

<p>Bolteh, it is called associative thinking. In average folks, they track rather well, because their minds are not in hyper mode.</p>
<p>If you are talking about baseball uniforms, you mostly stay on task. With some folks, (Such as ADD folks) you mention baseball uniforms, and suddenly, not only are they thinking about baseball uniforms, but about the manufacturing of high quality baseballs. (This switch happens in a pico second) […]</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m wondering if I have this… maybe, but in a different way.</p>
<p>In some complicated conversations I fail to express myself, I have a thought and can’t find the words. This is not a bad thing when writing like now  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I write a paragraph, go to another paragraph, and go back when I remember something. Like writing two paragraphs at the same time <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> But, in a conversation, in some situations I just can’t remember or process the arguments I already have in my head, it might even take minutes. Other times, the group changes the subject and the rest of the conversation give me something that I could have said back then. In these cases I don’t go back on the conversation, because people complain, instead I just get frustrated and stay quiet.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I guess I’m just slow to process informations.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>By the way, I once talked to a psychologist (in order to be tested to get a driver license) and she was quite impressed with the speed I finished a couple of tests. Then I said to her that I was distracted. She made a weird face and said “No, you are not.” and I was shocked. She said that I fail to pay attention in details, and that I have a selective memory: I remember what I want to remember. I seem to have no problem in focusing on something I want to.</p>
<p>My sister tells me “I’m going to wherever” and I just think “Why should I care?”. If you ask me where my sister went 2 seconds (I mean <span class="bbcode-i">literally</span> 2 seconds) after that, I would say I don’t remember. If you ask me that after one minute, I would say “She didn’t say me anything. She didn’t even talk to me today.” It’s not on purpose, I need to force myself to care in these situations to remember, that is not as easy as it looks like.</p>

<p>Of course it sounds familiar, what he’s explaining is perfectly normal conversational evolution. <span class="bbcode-i">Everyone</span> I know does this. If you talk about baseball uniforms, it’s pretty normal to at some point get to the sport itself, and thus you get to talk about the equipment, and then you talk about the companies that make them, and then you just talk about the different companies that make all sorts of sports equipment. And if you keep talking afte this point, you’ll end up with astrophysics and its impact on Kim Jong Il’s mental health.</p>
<p>I for one hope Note-anator isn’t a real doctor, because if he is, all his patients must have ADD or ADHD.</p>

            <p>I usually just sit back and be silent when that happens. I have a hard time focussing on what people are saying as it is, let alone when there’s people yelling from all directions :x</p>
<p>And Note-anator, sounds familiar :3 When I talk with my dad, we can go from talking about Formula 1 to, say religion or ancient history and everything in between over the course of half an hour.</p>

            <p>Ehm, not sure what you’re on about, but I’m talking about these situations:</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Black’]…A[COLOR=‘black’]…B<br>
C  <span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=‘Gray’]|||||</span>  D<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]…E[COLOR=‘black’]…F</p>
<p>E = me</p>
<p>A, F and D are talking about cars<br>
B, C and E are talking about music</p>
<p>So what you get is two totally different conversations being launched across the table, crossing one another. Each participant feels the urge to make sure that their conversation is louder than the other one, so you end up with a bunch of people nearly yelling at each other.</p>
<p>Most of my relatives are champions at that &gt;_&gt;</p>

<p>I don’t understand why people do that… When I was out for dinner for my mate’s birthday this weekend, we were with 9, and we all had one continuous conversation with each other, but why do so many people start splitting groups in half and start talking about different things all together?</p>

</aside>
<p>About 80% of that list applies to me as well. I wouldn’t consider “not being average” a disability, though, it’s something that makes me proud of myself. I also have difficulties sometimes in group conversations, but it varies a lot depending on the group and on the subject. In every group there is one or two who stay quieter then the rest in each conversation, I don’t see a big problem here.</p>
<p>The first time I suspected about having ADD was around ten years ago, when I first heard about this disorder. Back then I also heard that Einstein was known to have had this disorder, so I didn’t worry about it. I might or not have ADD, I don’t really care. I’ve learned (well, still learning actually) to deal with my own social problems with lots of patience, persistence and willpower. Just always keep trying until you get it right and never give up. Never look down.</p>
<p>On topic, if I found my 10 year old self, that is what I would have told myself. Never look down. Not only metaphorically but also literally. There is no need to be afraid of people. I would also tell myself not to worry about the bullying I would suffer from 5th to 8th grades. “Because words can’t change who you are. You will do and say stupid things, lots of times, prepare yourself. But, when that happens, don’t stay there crying over the spilled milk. Breath deeply, get a cloth and rub it. If there is nothing you can do, just smile and move on, leave it there. In the end it just doesn’t make difference.”</p>
<p>I have the impression that everything serious I say sounds dramatic <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> but I really have no desire to change that  :rolleyes:</p>
