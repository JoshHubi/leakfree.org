    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/might-and-magic-tribute-needs-you/860</link>
    <description>Hello guys.

Maybe I&#39;ve told you a few times about this project that I&#39;m involved into. It&#39;s a project that runs since quite a few years, but lately there&#39;s more and more people disappearing. What&#39;s more saddening is it once involved a lot of people, but not now.

This project is Might and Magic: Tribute. Basically it&#39;s a Tribute game to the Might and Magic series. Maybe some of you guys knows about this series, which is pretty old. If you don&#39;t know about it, let me explain it to you. It&#39;s a traditional RPG series, involving 4 characters you create, sometimes more. But it&#39;s particularity is it&#39;s completely open. You can go where you want, anytime you want, a bit [i]àla [/i] Oblivion, except the series existed before the TES series.

What makes is exceptional is the depth of the game. For example, it is said that Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven which is considered by many like the best game of the series, can take up to [u]300 hours[/u] to complete.

Now, why am I here posting this? It&#39;s because MMT needs help. Bad. As I told you before, the team is in pretty bad shape. And they need developers. they need [b]everything[/b]: Modellers, Concept Artists, Sound Engineers, Animators, Programmers, Writers, Mappers, Voice Actors, Janitors, Elfves, name it!

So, I hope you guys will help us! Thank you all.

[i]Edit: Oh I just realized I didn&#39;t posted their website. Here it is: [url]https://www.mmtribute.castlegobs.nl/[/url][/i]</description>

            <p>You really won’t understand how much i want to help the project.<br>
I love M&amp;M. Played the heroes 3, 4 and 5 and M&amp;M 7 (A LOT) and 9.<br>
I’ve been playing the games since i was i think 10 years old and still playing them (now 16). So a new might and magic with modern graphics and the classical gameplay would be like heaven for me. But yes the problem is: I am 16 and can’t do anything about it. But i can tell you one thing: if the game would be published instead of being a freeware i would buy it and I won’t be the only one. Because i am not the only one who likes m&amp;m that much…</p>
