    <title>Black Mesa doesn&#39;t install or run correctly at all</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-doesnt-install-or-run-correctly-at-all/12438</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having multiple issues here.

By default after installing Steam and installing the 2006 - 2007 sdk the black mesa installer wants to install to this area: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SniperGhostWarrior2\Bin32\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS

I do not know why. ( this is a family computer and I suspect my son once installed a pirated version of SniperGhostWarrior2 and this remnant is stuck off in the registry causing the wrong default path to show in the installer) I do not know how to clear this to make the installer install in it&#39;s correct default path. 

The really odd thing is that no matter how i install the game ( see below) Black mesa installer still creates a SniperGhostWarrior2 folder. Inside of it is a large folder called Bin32 and another folder called Dumps. I do not know why the installer is creating this SniperGhostWarrior2 folder.

I have read the correct address is : Be sure the game is installed to this directory: \Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS  

( from the Installation page here: [url]https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Installation_Manual[/url]) 

I had to manually create the folders for the path. After BM installed it ran the game from the check box that says &quot; run the game now&quot; when you click the Finsh button in the installer. The game did run but soon crashed on the first  loading screen during the opening train sequence. ( it froze with a screen of messed up graphics - funny looking rocks as if it didn;t render the scene properly) I could not find the game listed in Steam. So i did a search and found this which says you need to install the game to THIS different directory: 

Should be under steamapps\common\sourcemods in a dir called \BMS

 ( in this post: [url]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=491117&amp;postcount=4[/url]) - game not showing in steam library

I tried to reinstall to this again creating the folders manually. Still the game will not show up in the library - even after closing the Steam app or rebooting then re-opening. 

Why is the path in the post above different from the path in the installation instructions?  Which one is the correct path? One of those posts has to have incorrect information and this needs to be fixed - anyway, none of the paths worked for me to make this game work. I can&#39;t even find HL2.exe by searching my system for it.. i have tried to re-install several times which is a pain because the SDK takes fo long to download each time. 

I have no idea where to go from here or what i should do. Please help. Thanks.</description>

            <p>It should be installed in this location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS</p>
<p>It’s weird that it’s installing the game in the path you mentioned.</p>

            <p>that is the most messed up default mod directory I’ve ever seen, the first runner up is when my friend installed steam on the desktop folder so when he ran Steam uninstall the entire desktop folder was deleted and the entire user account was rendered useless</p>
