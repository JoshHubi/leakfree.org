    <title>Where Were You When You First Played The Final Xen Levels?</title>

    <description>I think the title is fairly self-explanatory.

I was at work. We had a publication deadline for a paper on December 10th (which later got extended to December 15th... *after* we busted our humps trying to meet the original one) and had none of our results ready, so my colleague Orhan and I trucked over to the concrete basement that serves as our lab around 6 PM and spent about two hours coding a simulation that would test our vision software. Then we had it run a bunch of different scenarios automatically, log the results, and then dumped them into a spreadsheet and stuck the resulting graph in our paper. We were there until 4 AM, and while the simulation was running I played through all the way from the &quot;Soon(TM)&quot; map in Interloper up to the end of the game.</description>
