[quote]
Steam Guard, a new Steam account security feature offering two-factor authentication, is now available in beta. As a Steam account holder, [B]you can now take advantage of this additional level of account security, further prohibiting others from gaining access to your account.[/b]

As a beta participant, once you&#39;ve verified your email address with Steam, Steam Guard becomes available for your use and is enabled for your Steam account by default. 

With Steam Guard enabled, anyone attempting to login as you from an unrecognized computer must first provide additional, one-time authorization. A special access code will be sent to your contact email address, and this code must be entered into Steam before your first login on an unfamiliar computer is complete. You will also be notified if any login attempts from computers other than those you&#39;ve authorized occur. Steam Guard essentially acts as a form of &quot;User Rights Management,&quot; where you as the user have greater control over access to your stuff.

&quot;Account phishing and hijacking are our top support issues,&quot; said Gabe Newell, President of Valve. &quot;With Steam Guard, we&#39;ve taken a big step towards giving customers the account security they need as they purchase more and more digital goods.&quot;

Gabe demonstrated further development of Steam Guard today at the CeBIT computing trade show in Hannover, Germany. In addition to email-based authentication, Steam Guard will soon offer other forms of secondary authentication, such as Intel® Identity Protection Technology, a hardware-based security feature available with the new 2nd Generation Intel® Core™ and Core™ vPro® processors. With IPT, secondary authentication is effortless, as it is provided by the chipset itself.

To opt into the latest Steam client beta and begin protecting your account with Steam Guard, launch the Steam client and visit Steam Settings&#39; Account tab, then changing your beta participation to “Steam Update.”

How to activate Steam Guard

1. Join the Beta [/B]

Steam Guard is currently only available to those who opt into the current Steam Beta, which you can do by visiting Steam Account Settings and changing your Beta participation to &quot;Steam Beta.&quot;


[b]2. Be sure your contact email address is verified with Steam.[/b]

As a Beta tester, you must also verify your contact email address with Steam. You can check whether your email address is already verified by visiting Steam Account Settings. A verified address will be marked as &quot;Verified.&quot; To verify your email address, follow these instructions.


[b]3. Restart Steam, three times.[/b]

Yes, that is a lot of times, but this is only a requirement during the beta.

            <p>I’m just going to throw this out there- Valve is a privately owned company. Thus, they can follow their own moral/technological code, instead of the directions of the major stockholders, whose real goal is to make money for themselves.<br>
Oh, and did I mention that the new Steam Guard is simply Valve utilizing Intel’s new Sandy Bridge processor architecture? That’s the only goddamn reason that Steam Guard currently exists. You don’t like it? Go buy an AMD machine, you’re safe.</p>

<p>Same, but sadly not everyone possesses this thing called “Common sense”.</p>
<p>I also like it as an extra security measure.  I used to use the same passwords and usernames for some accouts.  Then gawker got hacked and supposedly they stole passwords and stuff (I changed all my passwords and such though).  So it’ll be nice for if someone gets my password and its not my fault.</p>

</aside>
<p>And how does limiting a Steam account to a certain number of computers lead to extra profit?  A Steam account is already limited to one person and most people only play on one computer anyways.  There are those who like to play games on several different computers, but I’m pretty sure they’re not going to buy a game multiple times just for convenience.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re a little late then, because the possibility has been there waaayyyy before the SteamGuard feature showed up.</p>
<p>In conclusion: your entire argument is invalid and badly timed.  But we thank you, nonetheless.</p>

</aside>
<p>Any company that changes its license agreements is legally obligated to inform you that they’re doing so, though. You can always say “I disagree” and stop yourself from using Steam if it comes to that.</p>
<p>I personally don’t see the point in using one Steam account on a shitload of computers, anyway. As far as I’m aware, you can only be logged into your account on one at one time anyway, so it really wouldn’t change anything.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is a DRM that’s been being used for quite a while, actually. It’s one of the least invasive, as well. I don’t really see your issue with it, to be perfectly honest. It’s on two games that I own the hard copies for, that I remember: BioShock, and Far Cry 2. You install it, and when you try to run it for the first time, you register your CD-key, it checks the server bank to make sure it’s valid, and it takes off an install that can be used for that copy of the game. You can play it however much you want from that point onward. You uninstall the game, you get that install back. There’s really no point in installing one game on ten different machines in the first place.</p>

            <p>It wouldn’t exactly diminish the possibility of steamplay when limiting an account to 2 rigs. The Steam platform is a service provider for game publishers and with that comes an obligation to maximize profit for them. So there really is an interest in binding a product so that a player can play a game on as few machines as possible.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong here. I’m not saying Valve is an “insert insult here”. But I’m pointing out the possibility what restrictions can be implemented with such a drm system.</p>

            <p>although i’d think of this in the first place, this isn’t ubisoft or ea we are talking about. valve has no way to profit by limiting steam to run on 1 only machine (they do actually, but read on), they’d lose their profit because there are some people that run steam on their mac and on their pc, thus the idea of steamplay will be shot down. ( “Valve has decided to give one license for both PC and Mac games. This means that if you own a PC version of a game that has a Mac version, you will be able to play it on your Mac without any additional fees!” )</p>
<p>simply, no. if they did it it would be a massive downgrade and months of work they invested in crossplatform games would be ruined. Valve still isn’t a big asshole like ea and others, and i believe this will last for a long time</p>
<p>if you want to make a pessimistic view on Steamguard, at least have some arguments that will support your statements</p>
<p>edit: actually, no, don’t even try it, it’s my job to do that</p>

<p>Oh I read it, alright. Sounds good, except for the fact that nowadays rights are always cut back in the name of security.</p>
<p>I get the whole idea about adding another locked door to an account against phishing techniques and so (I appreciate the thought) - just saying you can also use it for something else completely (URM - user rights mutilation).</p>

<p>No, there’s no limit. Steam Guard is aimed to protect the value that  is yours, not limit your access to your stuff. As always, you can access  your Steam account and library from as many machines as you’d like.</p>

<p>I think the real purpose for this “guard” is not securing accounts, but rather restricting users to using only a few machines and so eliminating account sharing.

<p>No, it’s to protect your purchases.<br>
They have re-iterated numerous times that this is <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> to restrict your access to <span class="bbcode-i">your</span> content. Valve is pretty much the only large developer/publisher that’s taking this stance.</p>
