    <title>Smod Redux V8 Stuff</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/smod-redux-v8-stuff/5073</link>
    <description>Basicly in this thread you just post stuff about Smod Redux v8

first things first, the update.

I hated it alot and still do, but I found out how to get it to work (I don&#39;t know how many people know)

for me the patch did FUCKING NOTHING
well, for me to get it to work I just installed Smod &gt; Addons &gt; patch
then went into the Smod file and then into the GameInfo file
then changed the SteamAppID and ToolsAppID to 215
Bam, it works. (though some levels aren&#39;t textured right)

second thing is that I CAN NOT find all the weapons in Smod without cheating
I can find some but not all or even alot...
are some weapons only available through the cheat?
bull fuck...
also why is it that you can get the fists at a time where you can kill Lamarr with them?
I don&#39;t think that should have happened though I can&#39;t change it</description>
