    <title>Dune 2000 help</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dune-2000-help/1681</link>
    <description>Feelin in an old school mood I have installed Dune 2000 but its not working with Xp.It loads up to a black screen and then crashes back to the desktop.

I have tried patching it to the latest version, and  modifying the compatablity with no luck.

I have seen some advice on copying the movie data to another folder then craking it and changing the registry. But my movie data is on disc and theres an error in copying.

So as im not very good on messing about with the nuts and bolts of a game I would apreciate advice.

cheers</description>

            <p>I take it the game is rather old; if it doesn’t work in compatibility mode for W95/98, is it compatible with DOS? You can always try running it through DOSBox.</p>

            <p>Sounds like you don’t multicore processor anyway, so nevermind the affinity.</p>

            <p>Yes aze that does mean ive tried that already but thanks for the help man<br>
now setting the affinty of the game to one prosessor is new to me could you explain that?, I have a very old hypothreaded processor but that may be it.<br>
The instaltation is very unhelpfull, no way but there way but i’ll just double check…</p>
<p>Dam it would be odd to download somthing you legaly own, just to make it work whats the world comming to!<br>
and yes dune 2000 is a qaulity title if for anything the brilliant fmv seqeunces!</p>

            <p>Try to run it in windows 95 or 98 mode, that should do the trick.</p>
<p>EDIT: “and modifying the compatablity with no luck.” this means you tried it already or what?</p>

            <p>Make sure you have full rights and ownership the folder. That might do the trick.<br>
Or is that just a Vista issue?</p>
<p>I think you can choose to copy the movie data to your hard drive during installation. If that’s the case, reinstall and do that, and try that fix again.</p>
<p>Something else that might work is setting the affinity for the game to one core, if you have a multiple-core processor.</p>

            <p>As crazy as it may sound, you might try checking Torrents for the game – if there are any “live” torrents of it, it’s very probable that what you will get from them will work on XP/Vista.</p>
