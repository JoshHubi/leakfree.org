<p>^^^</p>
<p>Day of Defeat is in dire need of a new game too. DoD Source was quite disappointing and at some point Valve just forgot about it, leaving players with a broken, unfinished game that is just shadow of the sheer brilliance that was the goldsrc mod version of it. A CSGO style revival would be awesome.</p>

<p>Castle Crashers, Batman Arkam Earth, Shadow of the Colossus( the end was already good, but I would like to see more, Superbrothers Sword &amp; Sworcery EP,  Kingdoms of Amalur: Rekoning.</p>

<p>Definitely.  Though, TOR kind of fills the spot for a KOTOR 3.  Not saying they’re the same game, but they’re sort of like cousins in a way.</p>

<p>There already are 2 spiritual successors to System Shock 2 - Bioshock and Bioshock 2. I know that you’re missing Shodan, we all do, but other than that, Bioshock franchise IS the spiritual successor to System Shock franchise. You have everything in it that made System Shock 1/2 so great:</p>
<ol>
<li>Post-catastrophe environment</li>
<li>Self-improvement using hard to come by “currency”</li>
<li>Seemingly everpresent nemesis which is not only observing your (almost) every step, but is frequently commenting on it, mocking you, hindering your progress.</li>
<li>Puzzle elements, “go-and-fetch” subquests, passwords that must be discovered (if only they were randomly generated for each player, so he/she would actually have to find them)</li>
<li>Multiple strategies (mind control, stealth, hacking, direct combat, traps)</li>
<li>Persistent world allowing you to go back and forth, and actually requiring it for some subquests.</li>
<li>Criticism of mankind’s attitude, society, social problems, psyche…</li>

            <p>KotOR 3, Arkham 3, and BF3, like M-Man said.</p>
<p>Mirror’s Edge 2 like many people here said.</p>
<p>And now…This next one doesn’t <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> a sequel, but I still <span class="bbcode-i">want</span> a sequel: Jade Empire.</p>
<p>A new Jedi Knight game would be awesome IF it were just as moddable as Outcast and Academy. If it’s not moddable, I’m not interested.</p>
<p>Also, HL2: Episode 2.</p>
<p>Oh, just remembered another one. Mount &amp; Blade needs a real sequel. Hopefully with campaign co-op. That would be amazing. Thankfully, Taleworlds has said that they plan a proper sequel with a new engine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and?</p>
<p>Wasn’t it intentional?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, it was very much intentional. Basically the entire point of MGS2 was that Hideo Kojima hated fans who idolized Solid Snake, hated his publisher for making him milk the franchise, and hated the fans even more for continuing to buy into his games despite his obvious attempt at brutalizing them through the story.</p>
<p>Heck, I’m one of the few people who actually liked the ending, because it brought up commentary on mass surveillance and censorship before people even thought twice about it, despite the story being penned mostly before 9/11. The game is even used to teach meme theory in some college courses. I’m not saying MGS2 is a bad game.</p>
<p>I am, however, saying that MGS3 was the more polished product. It’s decontructive elements, such as the entire story arc of the Boss, served the story rather than merely brutalizing the player. It had greater gameplay variety, better controls, better camera- Everything about it was just <span class="bbcode-i">better.</span> A shame that only the first two acts of MGS4 were worthwhile to play through more than once. A tailing mission, a nostalgia chapter, and a map with all enemies instantly alerted to your presence does not a fun Metal Gear make, particularly when it’s billed on sneaking through battlefields in virtually every press kit about the game ever.</p>
<p>A game can be critical of itself, it’s medium, and it’s story tropes without leaning out of the screen and screaming at the player “YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE FOR BUYING THIS. FUCK OFF.”</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: The way to do it would probably be Peace Walker, in terms of deconstructing the player’s involvement in the story. You’re basically making Big Boss relive his most painful memories of the end of MGS3, and helping him turn his unit of mercenaries into [COLOR=‘Black’]Outer Heaven, complete with it’s own Metal Gear. It’s amazingly subtle compared with MGS2. I sure felt like an asshole at the end of that game. Then I went back and started playing the Pooyan missions because this game is fucking addicting.</p>

            <p>I don’t if it NEEDS one, but a sequel for Jet Force Gemini would be cool. I agree with Mirror’s Edge and Psychonauts as well.</p>

            <p>Blue Shift 2. I really want one for some reason, even though the original wasn’t much of anything.</p>
<p>Batman Arkham 3 would also be really cool, i’d hate for them to end it on two. I think it should be a trilogy.</p>
<p>And of course the constant bitching for a Kotor 3 and Battefront 3 probably grows weary but dammit I do want those games.</p>

<p>Alpha Protocol (doesn’t need to continue the story, unless it would work well. I haven’t finished the game so I don’t know)</p>
<p>Mirror’s Edge (again, doesn’t have to continue the story as the story ended well, just a game with similar gameplay)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>^^^</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure Rockstar is working on it right now but a new Red Dead would be pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Day of Defeat is in dire need of a new game too. DoD Source was quite disappointing and at some point Valve just forgot about it, leaving players with a broken, unfinished game that is just shadow of the sheer brilliance that was the goldsrc mod version of it. A CSGO style revival would be awesome.</p>

<p>The first Opposing Force wasn’t even made by Valve.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve been saying for a while that Valve should have commissioned another Opposing Force from someone to at least hold us over. There are a couple independent companies who could probably make a decent one, including Gearbox.</p>
<p>Anyway, the one sequel I really, really want is the one I can never, ever have: System Shock 3. I wish someone would at least kickstart a spiritual successor or something. Kinda amazed that hasn’t happened yet, to be honest.</p>
