            <p>I was making that connection between True Crime and Sleeping Dogs. I just wasn’t sure if that was actually the case. Good news, though, because I was looking forward to it before it was announced that the project was canned.</p>

            <p>Sleeping Dogs is basically True Crime: HongKong that was scraped long time ago and pick up by another publisher. They change the name to Sleeping Dogs is because the original publisher have the copyright on the original name.</p>
<p>The reason why they call it Sleeping Dogs is also based on 80s Hong Kong crime movie.</p>

            <p>Watch Dogs is actually a more relevant title to the context of the game than Sleeping Dogs is to itself but anyone who does a minimum amount of research will quickly learn the difference between the two.</p>
