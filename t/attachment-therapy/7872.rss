            <p>So umm, what is this shit.</p>
<p>What exactly are they trying to acomplish here? I honestly have no idea, I only watched the first video. Jokerine, there is no way that can be mistaken for therapy, that’s abuse plain outright. You did right to get out of there.</p>
<p>EDIT: That Thomas bitch is a lunatic.</p>

            <p>I may be a bit late to the party, but, as a person who went through this kind of “therapy” in all but name (being locked up, denied food and clothing, used as sexual object in my father’s parties, and so on), it fills me with endless rage to see someone, such as Mrs. Thomas here, actually encouraging this kind of shit. It does nothing, NOTHING to help form normal attachments to care giving figures - in fact, it’s the reason I ran away from home a few months ago. It makes you unstable, borderline suicidal, and in all a miserable person, as sersoft so cleverly stated before.</p>
<p>I know (and hope) nobody of the members here would ever, EVER consider doing this to a child. From the link in the OP you can imagine it won’t be any good, and well, I can confirm it.</p>

<p>Hows the weather on mars you ignoramus, 'cause you living there is the only way you could have missed the international sex abuse scandal that is still  going on in the church. Take your fingers out of your ears and uncover your eyes. It was not fundamentalists, it was the mainstream clergy, from dioceses all over the planet.  Btw, did you know the pope was a NAZI. Oh yeah, mentioning the fact that the pope was in the Hitler must also be  trollin.</p>

<p>No, this is the same case of an idiot trying to be the doctor. An adequate person wouldn’t apply for a surgeon if he doubts that he can do this, right? Some still do apply and end up fucking up other people’s lives or ending them.</p>
<p>Why? Money. Or more rarely - no brains.</p>
<p>Attachment therapy exists. Real doctors do practice it in one form or another, but they know what they’re doing and what can be done and what is prohibited.<br>
However, those guys linked in OP are fucking unqualified morons. Or it was made to look like this.</p>

            <p>Man of course it will make for a lot of butthurt americans demanding to ‘MAKE A LAW FOR CANDICE’ (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocates_for_Children_in_Therapy" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocates_for_Children_in_Therapy</a>) if the headlines cover only the most notorious fucking idiots like the ones in OP by ripping out the most controversial snippets and making a neat compilation. That’s how social sphere works in the western countries.</p>
<p>But there’s nothing wrong with the theory. The ‘illness’ itself does exist - I can acknowledge that myself. And it’s either the loss of their parents or some serious cul-de-sac that makes something click in a person.</p>

<p>Unqualified and even veteran Surgeons can also inadvertently kill their patients (some of the also kids), but that doesn’t really get top headlines, does it?</p>
