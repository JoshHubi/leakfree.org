    <title>Cpu  urgrade</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cpu-urgrade/2167</link>
    <description>Alright Im looking to upgrade my CPU to somthing better and I would like some sugestions to the best compatible chip for my P5N32-E SLI plus motherboard.

I am aware its got a bad rep as a board but its behaved really well for me, and I cant afford to replace it to surgestions on the chip only.

Thanks you guys have been really helpfull in the past.</description>

            <p>If want a cpu that will last u long time, get an i7, but that would require a new mobo. If u can find it, the Q6600 is very good and cheap quad core. Its an easy overclocker and easily out preforms the more expensive Core 2 Quad series cpu’s once its OC’d. I got mine to 3.5ghz and its completely stable, but its getting swapped out for an i7 920 soon.</p>

            <p>Well what’s your price range? Information like that would help, or an estimate to what you want from the CPU, or something like that.</p>
