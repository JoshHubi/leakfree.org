    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crate-system/10991</link>
    <description>I have noticed that only a very few have any contents inside.
For example, there&#39;s a room with about 10 crates (dunno the chapter now) with all empty, it appears like they were placed there just for people to smash them, so it doesn&#39;t take 2-3 hours to complete the mod for the first time, simply playthrough prolongers.

Wouldn&#39;t it be possible to code random &quot;loot&quot; inside and make the crates randomly generative? For an example, once this crate on the left is empty and on my right has shotgun shells, the second time I come they are reversed (right empty) and it&#39;s a grenade instead.

Opinions/ideas?

            <p>Guess I wasn’t paying that much attention myself. I haven’t decompiled anything so I can’t speak for that, I just know through my play throughs they seemed random. So I apologize for any and all information that I got wrong. X3</p>

            <p>^They only started to use item_dynamic_resupply extensively during the HL2 episodes. In vanilla HL2, most of the item crates were mapper-defined, IIRC from my map decompilation adventures.</p>

<p>You actually are wrong. in Half life, half life 2, and so on whats in the crates you smash normally depends on what you need most. Health ammo power, ect. In half life 2 and episodes they changed this up a bit so only supply crates offered items. if you were smart with your ammo, most times you’d leave stuff behind because they always spawn stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yep, most of them contain entities called “item_dynamic_resupply”, which creates one item based on what you need. If I’m on full health and ammo and there’s a battle coming up, I tend to avoid smashing the crates until I’m hurt so they’ll give me medkits rather than superfluous pistol ammo.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s interesting. So maybe I never got anything because I almost never needed health/suit/ammo? (I tended to play on Medium a lot and was a bit conservative with my ammo usage)</p>
<p>I know for a fact that in the HL2 episodes, they switched from a purely mapper-defined supply crate system to a dynamic supply crate system, which changed the contents of a crate depending on your needs.</p>

<p>I noticed that too. They are far too light. Maybe there are other physics issues (carry, push, throw) that requires them to be so light. Maybe.</p>

<p>So maybe reduce the number of crates and even some of the useless generic barrels on a level and have the remaining crates have a higher probability of spawning items. Not all, but more instances than there are now.</p>

<p>I realize that crates serve other purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Line of sight obstacle (enemies, doors, health-charger units).</li>
<li>Provide cover from enemy attacks.</li>
<li>Assist in reaching overhead areas.</li>
<li>Can be used as a weapon when thrown at enemies.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, I think the most important use for them should be to provide some type of loot, as a reward to those that take the time to fully search a level to take advantage of and extract every benefit that it has to offer.</p>

<p>Yeah I felt the crates seemed very empty as well. I think I only got ammo from them one time otherwise it was the occasional suit power, but even that was very rare. Playing through half-life the crates were pretty much the main place you got ammo. In this mod the ammo is often sitting somewhere and you end up missing it a lot or not realizing when you get ammo for a weapon.</p>

<p>My brother didn’t even bother with the crates anymore once he found out that the goods inside them are a rarity.</p>

            <p>One thing in HL I just noticed while replaying today is that a large number of crates take a single hit to pop open. I thought it odd during my BM play that breaking the crates seemed like such a chore with little reward. In HL the goodies were increased and while not all crates destroyed with a single crowbar hit, a large portion of them did. I haven’t really noticed a consistent reason as to why some are so weak compared to others though.</p>

            <p>The only place I would like to see more crates with stuff in them would be residue processing I ended up running out of ammo and not being able to get by the trip mines on the conveyor belts because i had to shoot them. But other then that i dont really mind as long as there is a lot of stuff lying around which is more realistic.</p>
