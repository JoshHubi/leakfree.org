    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/breaking-bad/7650</link>
    <description>It&#39;s an awesome show, why don&#39;t you people talk about it?

In the show a chemistry teacher starts to cook meth when he finds out that he has lung cancer, though it&#39;s more about how that character evolves and the people he affects with what he&#39;s doing.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am seriously addicted to this show, it’s like meth. I don’t watch much TV, but after being introduced to BrBa last year by someone, I’ve honestly found it to be the best show I’ve ever seen, or probably will see in a long time. Everything about it is just amazing, the writing, the acting, the cinematography , the pacing of the story. It’s seriously intense at times, and funny at others. It easily compares to other high profile shows like the Wire and the Sopranos in my opinion, but what I like about Br Ba is it’s relatively small cast of characters. To me, these people seem like real characters with complex morals and behaviours stuck in bizzare and sometimes surreal situations. Not many shows have you start of sympathizing with a central character that transforms from a law abiding family man with good intentions, into a soulless, drug dealing monster that rationalizes his actions as a means of not seeing himself as the bad guy. He effects everyone around him in a caustic manner.<br>
<em>SEASON 4 SPOILERS</em><br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]Season 4 is a little bit slow at the moment, but things are going to get very intense again this season with the struggle between Gus and Walt, and not to mention the Cartel making a move against Gus in retaliation for his betrayal. I’m also interested in seeing if Walt will use Hanks knowledge of the meth lab as some kind of leverage against Gus, but this show is so unpredictable at times you can’t guess what the writers will come up with.<br>
END SPOILERS<br>
But seriously, if you haven’t seen this show, do yourself a favour and watch it from Episode 1. This isn’t one of those shows where you can jump in around mid season, it’s very story driven and you’ll want to watch it in order to get the full effect of it. It’s not a show for everyone, it is quite bleak and depressing at times and the subject matter deals with death, choice and consequences, family and many other interesting things. Also to those saying that finding out Bryan Cranston played Hal put them off the show, put all those preconceptions aside, you’ll be glad you did. I found it so odd at first because of how well he portrayed this totally different character to what he is usually casted as.</p>
<p>But yeah, I am a Breaking Bad addict. I admit this.<br>
But seriously, watch it. Now. YEAH SCIENCE, BITCHES!<br>
(Science geeks will find this show fucking badass)</p>

            <p>I had no idea it was Hal until they had a picture of his face up on youtube a few weeks ago. Recognized the pattern of his wrinkles and my head blew apart</p>

            <p>Great show, I really hate Skylar in it though, she really, really, annoys me. But I guess I hate her in a way because she’s a good character.</p>
