    <title>Steam is currently unavailable, please try again later</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-is-currently-unavailable-please-try-again-later/3526</link>
    <description>That is the message I was greeted with earlier when I tried to start(which started the automatic update) Steam.

I have renamed the clientregistry.blob, tried updating it in safe mode, running it as an administrator and I have removed every trace of Steam from my computer and reinstalling to no avail(it now gives Win32 Error 5 :frowning: ).
I was wondering if anyone else was having this issue, and if so, did you fix it and how?

I am on Windows Vista SP2 32-Bit, if that&#39;s any help.

EDIT:
I appear to have fixed it, renaming the clientregistry.blob, running in safe mode with networking and running steam.exe as administrator seems to have allowed Steam to update itself(although I tried this earlier and it didn&#39;t like it...), ignore this thread unless you are having a similar issue. \o/</description>

            <p>That is the message I was greeted with earlier when I tried to start(which started the automatic update) Steam.</p>
<p>I have renamed the clientregistry.blob, tried updating it in safe mode, running it as an administrator and I have removed every trace of Steam from my computer and reinstalling to no avail(it now gives Win32 Error 5 <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> ).<br>
I was wondering if anyone else was having this issue, and if so, did you fix it and how?</p>
<p>I am on Windows Vista SP2 32-Bit, if that’s any help.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I appear to have fixed it, renaming the clientregistry.blob, running in safe mode with networking and running steam.exe as administrator seems to have allowed Steam to update itself(although I tried this earlier and it didn’t like it…), ignore this thread unless you are having a similar issue. \o/</p>
