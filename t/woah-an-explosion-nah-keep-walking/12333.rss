    <title>Woah, an explosion... Nah. Keep walking.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/woah-an-explosion-nah-keep-walking/12333</link>
    <description>This isn&#39;t so much a bug as it is an immersion issue, move the thread if mecessary. I was playing Surface Tension, I had just gotten to the dam. There are a lot of soldiers walking in formation through the gate, and I threw a grenade at them. It exploded just out of damage distance, but right behind them, where it would have been deafening  and made a strong shockwave in real life. A less powerful bomb recently detonated in Boston (sorry to bring this up) blew off limbs from further away. But the soldiers in the game didn&#39;t even care. They just kept walking. I got closer to throw another and then one of them noticed me. What kind of AI do these guys have to completely ignore a grenade? The game is so absolutely amazing that I overlooked it, but it would ramp up the immersion even more if that were better.</description>

            <p>I guess this implies the HECU are too badass to care for the surroundings, like in half life where they would just run through explosions without caring.<br>
But in all seriousness, I imagined they would act cowardly when explosions near them happened, since they do react cowardly when an mp5 grenade blows up next to them.</p>

<p>“Cool guys don’t look at explosions” requires the said cool guy to have caused the explosion first. But funny joke though.</p>

            <p>Never noticed it because I always just shot the explosive barrels they were walking by. Still would be great if it was fixed.</p>
