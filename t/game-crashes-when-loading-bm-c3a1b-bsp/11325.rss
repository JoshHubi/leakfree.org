    <title>Game crashes when loading bm_c3a1b.bsp</title>

    <description>Hi!

I have a curious problem. I have the typicall graphic problems with de purple an black texture, but a part of that, the game used to work perfectly. 

The problem is that [b]in the chapter FORGET ABOUT FREEMAN[/b], when I have to climb the stairs to go to the surface, on the loading time, [b]the game just stays eternally loading.[/b]

5:50

[b]I&#39;ve tried to load that part with the console, the map is bm_c3a1b[/b], but it just doesn&#39;t work. It works with all the other maps that I&#39;ve tried. I can go 
to the next map &quot;lambda core&quot; but if it&#39;s possible, I don&#39;t want a miss a part of the game. 

Is there someone else with the same problem?

Any idea of what is happening?


Thank you</description>
