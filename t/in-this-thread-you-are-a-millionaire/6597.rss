<p>Sorry dude, but I disagree. There are a LOT of regular people who are free from financial worries because they made smart decisions with regular incomes. People who are millionaires but you wouldn’t know it, because they don’t spend like mad, and they don’t act any different. Nor do they suddenly turn insane, like you suggest they would.</p>

            <p>Dr. Evil: Gentlemen, it has come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here’s the plan. We get the warhead and we hold the world ransom for… ONE MILLION DOLLARS!<br>
Number Two: Don’t you think we should ask for <span class="bbcode-i">more</span> than a million dollars? A million dollars isn’t exactly a lot of money these days. Virtucon alone makes over 9 billion dollars a year!<br>
Dr. Evil: Really? That’s a lot of money. Okay then, we hold the world ransom for… One… Hundred… BILLION DOLLARS!</p>

            <p>I think the key problem this thread has is that no one seems to know what millionaire means. It means you have a million dollars. Total. That is not, for example, enough to even buy one Veyron, even if you were willing to never pay for gas. Its barely enough to probably buy a medium size house in LA. Its not that much money if you’re hoping to live the high life.</p>

<p>Well the point is that you need a certain degree of financial worries to live as a “normal” person. That is the main reason why people always want more. So they have financial worries. And thus stay people.</p>
<p>I know that it sounds crazy, but unless you are tremendously self-aware you will always want more. And people who have no existencial worries, quickly degenerate and turn to fun things like cocaine and hunting people for sports because they lose all sense for reality.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sorry dude, but I disagree. There are a LOT of regular people who are free from financial worries because they made smart decisions with regular incomes. People who are millionaires but you wouldn’t know it, because they don’t spend like mad, and they don’t act any different. Nor do they suddenly turn insane, like you suggest they would.</p>

            <p>I have so much money I don’t need to know how to spell. Spelling is for poor people and other douchebags. Fuck, I think you’re just envious. But that’s allright. I don’t need no friends. I have so much money I can buy one when I need one. With all this money who’s gonna stop me? Nobody, that’s who. And for your information, I can’t go back to my mother’s basement, I never left. I’ve got all kinds of fancy shit here, I don’t need go anywhere. Fuck, if I want to go somewhere, I just buy some mining crew to make a new extension to my basement.</p>

            <p>A millionaire could spell “millionaire” correctly.  Go back to your mother’s basement.</p>

            <p>Am I a millionare? I mean of course I am. Now quit staring you cheap bastards. Have you never seen a man frolicking naked on a pile of money before? I’ve got so much money I don’t give a shit what you all think. Now beat it before I’ll buy Black Mesa development team and force them to make it as it should be, with pink fluffy bunnies and uniconrns and shit. You know I could. I have so much money I pretty much own the world already.</p>
