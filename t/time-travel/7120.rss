    <title>Time Travel</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/time-travel/7120</link>
    <description>Well, I thought it would be great to discuss our theories of time and the movement about it. 

My many theories:

#1: Time is linear, and can&#39;t be manipulated at all.

#2: Time is multiple lines, 
       Line 1: &quot;Now&quot; Line, this is whats happening now, and it&#39;s constantly           
       Changing. It&#39;s like a universal clock, the Main time line.
  
       Line 2: The &quot;old&quot; line, it can move freely between the past           
       But never intertwines with Now or the future.   

       Line 3: The &quot;New&quot; line, A line that can move freely and infinitely into the 
       future, can&#39;t collide with Now or Past.

#3: Time is one line for now,
      Right now it&#39;s one line, but when a time machine is created a new line will  
      be formed, but it can&#39;t travel to a period where a time machine doesn&#39;t  
      exist.

I have more, but i&#39;m too tierd to type.</description>

            <p>Someonerandm is right, all of the discussion about religious crap up to this point has been about “is it or is it not true” &amp; not “can or can’t it be proven”</p>
<p>Personally I think time travel would only be possible within a localized field, like in Primer (I always end up bringing up that piss-boring movie) where time travel was limited to the confides of the machine itself. My reasoning for thinking this is because time is not a universal constant. In order for a time machine to go back in time to a point in history before the time machine was made, you’d need to alter the flow of time outside the machine. In other words that would be like trying to rewind the movement of the earth &amp; by extension you’d pretty much need to do the same to the entire universe which would require infinite amounts of energy.</p>

<p>Hahahahahaha that’s the stupidest stance I’ve ever seen someone take on the Bible. If you were an atheist who did any sort of investigation into the Bible instead of forming a convoluted opinion about it out of thin air, you would realize that there’s historical background to it and that Christ did indeed exist. What you choose to believe or not believe beyond that is up to you, but saying the entire book is a fabrication is just plain ignorant.</p>

<p>That’s what they <span class="bbcode-b">want</span> you to think! /conspiracyface</p>
<p>Also, Jesus or any other bible character could have existed, but they wouldn’t have special Jesus powers. For example, Jesus could be real, but he didn’t turn water to wine or walk on an ocean or Moses in the old testament (I don’t know what the jews holy book is called) he couldn’t just split the Nile.</p>

            <p>I’m not asserting that he never existed.  I’m saying that there’s no contemporary evidence for the person named “Jesus” (Iesus, whatever).  The first actual definitive mentions of the man named “Jesus” seems to have cropped up much later, like in the 300s or something (I could find the actual information but CBA and getting ready for bed).</p>
<p>There could’ve been a man around the turn from BC to AD (though, at the time, it wasn’t called that) that eventually became the inspiration for Jesus, but I suspect he would’ve been very different from the Bible character.  Christ is a title, much like “judge” or “prince” and Jesus wasn’t the only “Christ”.</p>

            <p>I’ve heard many opinions on Christ and his ministry from atheists and believers alike; the assertion that he never existed at all has been rare. In my experience, anyway. Not saying that this is proof he did, necessarily, but apologetics and critical historians alike seem to agree that there was a man named Jesus who ministered around the flip from BC to AD.</p>

            <p>There is actually no contemporary evidence that the Jesus of the Bible existed, but evidence that the character was cobbled together from other people (such as Dionysus).  Like Harry Potter mentioning London and Kings Cross station, the Bible has certain elements of “truth” and “fact”, but wrapped into a completely fictional story.</p>
<p>Now, if we could take a time machine back to that time period to get contemporary evidence…   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>time is the 4th dimension, why can’t it be bended if the other strings can?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no way to time travel. If there were a way to time travel in the sense of people going back in time in one plane of reality, we would most certainly already know about it, because someone would have inevitably at one point in time come here and either spilled the beans accidentally or on purpose. All of history would be a mess of people hopping in and out, even if all this ocoured thousands of years apart.</p>
<p>Dimentional travel is a totally different case however.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That is correct only if you believe that the future is predetermined and can’t be changed. Think like this: time travel hasn’t been discovered yet, so there can not “yet” be time travel. Only after the moment in time somebody invents it, the time travelers start to pop up in the past.</p>
<p>To put it briefly, if future was predetermined, there couldn’t be time travelling because when you travel back time, the future always changes in some way.</p>

 The Prince of Persia:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of time,<br>
and I can tell you, they are wrong. Time is an ocean in a storm.</p>
