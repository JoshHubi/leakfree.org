        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Anyway as for the law proposed, someone asked if anyone actually read it, I did.</p>
<p>The whole problem is that the language of the law is EXTREMELY vague, and a lot of it is also up to opinion instead of cut and dry. “using such force to protect himself or herself against the injury he or she believes to be threatened to the (baby)”</p>
<p>Technically, you could give someone a disease that could harm the child. Just being around that person could be said to be threatening injury unto the child, and with the language in the bill the only way you could get out of that situation is to stay away from them, and if they work with you, unless you move you’re shit outta luck.</p>

<p>A rapist by definition has already committed rape, and can’t become a non rapist. Just sayin’</p>

</aside>
<p>yes i know, but you can prevent future rapes. we live in a fucked up society when rape is so prevalent that so many women will be sexually assaulted in their lives, and we feel the need to teach THEM how to AVOID it instead of teaching the offenders to not do it. and it’s not only an issue with women! women can rape women, men can rape men, men can rape women and women can rape men. it’s ALWAYS an issue, no matter the sex or gender of the offender or the victim.</p>
<p>how rape is viewed needs to change. someone who is raped can be seen as “damaged goods”, or even worse, blamed for their own rape. “they shouldnt have been out late at night” “they shouldn’t have dressed like that” “they should have known who they were with” “they shouldnt have trusted him/her” are all very real things people say about rape victims, and it needs to stop. the only person to blame is the rapist.<br>
people need to stop pretending rape doesnt happen, as well. but another problem is people making it seem like rape is a NORMAL thing, that “just happens” and don’t treat it as an issue.<br>
people need to stop equating rape with ANY kind of sexuality. anybody can be raped. rape is not about physical attraction.<br>
people need to be better educated about rape and the effects it has on society. these are all components of rape culture, and too few people know about it.<br>
of course it wont eradicate rape. nothing will, that’s one of the worst things about the human race. there will always be someone fucked up enough to force themselves on someone else. but i do believe if we change how we view rape, rapists, and rape victims, the amount of rapes will decline and society will be better off as a whole.</p>

            <p>uhh by informing them what is and isnt rape, most rapes that occur are committed by someone the victim knows and trusts.<br>
people dont understand that its rape even if youre together or married and they say no. if you have to beg them over and over until they give in but they do not want to, it is rape. doing anything to a person unable to give informed consent is RAPE.</p>

<p>no, it cant be eradicated, because the human race is shit. but if society would focus on teaching rapists not to rape instead of teaching victims to avoid rape, it would be a lot better. if men who were raped werent made fun of, and if women who were raped werent shamed or accused of lying, it would be a LOT BETTER. the attitude towards rape needs to change.</p>
<p>and “oh its out of the rapists control!” is extremely rare. that’s another part of rape culture. “oh, he/she just couldn’t hold him/herself back!” is rape apology which is not ok. they RAPED someone. they deserve no pity.</p>

            <p>You seem to think that rape can be eradicated. It can’t. It is apart of mental illness, an inability of one’s to control his doings. Eliminating rape is like eliminating war, or diseases, it just cannot be done, but it can lowered.</p>

            <p>What I was trying to say was this: You said that Canada is just as bad as America when it comes to rape, when the US has a rape per capita of over twenty times Canada’s. Of course any amount of rape is bad, and I did not imply that it ‘wasn’t so bad.’ I was simply finding yet another inconsistency with what you had said. Don’t try to belittle me just because it “kinda” seems like I was being misogynistic; it’s a lot better to have something concrete to insult me on.</p>

<p>Wrong. I never said that. Do we treat babies like adults? No. However, we do recognize they have the potential to be adults. The same applies to fetuses.</p>

<p>Yet, isn’t you who said that fetuses ARE babies because have the “potential/likelihood” of becoming babies?  So, why are fetuses babies but babies aren’t adults?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I never said rape was an isolated incident; I rather meant the views of the people reported in <a href="http://abostonmarriage.com" rel="nofollow noopener">abostonmarriage.com</a>.</p>
<p>This isn’t really arguing for anything in particular, but note that canada’s rape per capita is rather low on the list.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">no, they’re not.</span> she links to her own articles, but there’s ALWAYS a source.</p>
<p>and nowhere did i say it ONLY happens in developed countries. i said it DOES, since everyone seems to think that omg canada and america are good clearly theres none of that here!!</p>
<p>and i dont believe EVERY word they say. obviously i disagree with some of what they say, but what they say in those articles is actually right.</p>
<p>and as for the isolated incidents, the statistics that imonfire posted himself that show that canada has more rape per capita kind of disproves that.</p>

<p>Again, those sources from that certain ‘shakespearesister’ link that was posted previously <span class="bbcode-i">were all by herself.</span> The one you list now is better, but it’s only one single place in Canada - what’s to stop that from just being an isolated incident? Even then, the author (which is obviously incredibly biased) is forming negative conjecture on something <span class="bbcode-i">that she even thinks is kind of a good thing.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://Abostonmarriage.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Abostonmarriage.com</a> is, again, only drawing sources from a limited amount of areas in Canada - two. It also only focuses on the actions of two or three people, so you could always safely conclude that they’re just complete idiots and that not every single goddamn person in a civilized country is a victim of ‘rape culture’.</p>
<p><a href="http://gender-focus.com" rel="nofollow noopener">gender-focus.com</a> is exactly like all the others: it is incredibly biased and makes baseless conjecture. Hell, some of the stuff on there goes against what you’ve said yourself: Islamic states have a history of misogyny, but you say that rape culture only happens in “places that pretend women are equal.”</p>
<p>Basically, you are taking feminist articles, with clear feminist bias, and yet you believe every single word of it. You can not trust a person to make a balanced argument if she is a fanatical supporter of one end, and hates the other.</p>

<p>This has taken a turn. Anyway, is that total? Because that refects really badly on Canada then.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yeah, you’re really hurting your cause. Why not click that “Per-capita” button there so you can see how much worse Canada actually is. Believe it or not, its to be expected that a country with 250 million more people has more rape. Lern2Statistic</p>
<p>Anyway, don’t really know what argument I just interfered in, but I’m gonna bail on it.</p>

            <p>Do you normally rabidly insult everyone who has a different opinion than you, Fancy? I mean, really, this is starting to feel like troll territory. Arguing is fine, but there’s no reason to call people assholes if they’re not really insulting you that personally.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’d like to know how Canada is just as bad, since I’ve never been there and you give no supporting evidence to back up that claim.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, hey look Fancy, a moderator mentioned you!</p>
