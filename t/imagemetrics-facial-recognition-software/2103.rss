<blockquote>
<p>Performance Capture</p>
<p>We require NO markers, NO makeup and NO special equipment.  All we need to capture the actor’s performance is a video camera. The facial performance can be captured in a sound studio at the same time as the voice-over performance. Directors can direct the actor’s performance in real-time, and capture the emotions and expressions that perfectly tell the story.</p>
<p>Analysis and Performance Transfer</p>
<p>Applying our proprietary computer vision technology, we analyze the performance pixel-by-pixel, teaching the computer to “see” how an individual’s face moves.The data that results is then transferred to the 3D model to drive the animation in standard 3D applications, such as 3ds max, Maya, XSI, Lightwave and more. Once the data is applied, we can tweak the animation based on your input.</p>
<p>Re-Integration</p>
<p>We give the final animation to you as animation curves created in your animation package of choice. Because we created the animation in your tool of choice, the final animation integrates seamlessly back into your pipeline. The resulting CG facial performance exposes all of the subtle facial details and nuances that bring characters to life, such as eye and lip movements, as well as wrinkles.</p>

<p>Eventhough it’s not in realtime yet they will develop the technology, I’m sure of it.</p>

            <p>Though there are programs that do manipulate the model’s facial muscles in real time, and I’m sure they could develop a function like that though I feel it would be specific for each game engine.</p>

<p>the software tracks the face movements real time and moves it to the model. They still have to tweak it of course to look perfect cause it’s only a 2 year old technology but it can still recognize a face. I’m sure that one day we’ll be using it in video games to control our character’s faces.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Nothing is done in real time. The face movements are captured, analyzed and then moved onto the model. My point still stands that the video you linked to in your OP is more about photo realistic characters than anything else. And nothing to do with face recognition which is what you’ve called this thread.</p>

            <p>It would be an incredibly useful tool for hammer though, in order to help out with faceposer for cutscenes and such. Once you get the basic facial expressions down, you would pretty much only need to tweak a little. In game isn’t quite as useful though, unless you’re doing a second life style game where it’s only purpose is to screw around with.</p>
<p>Seriously though, what the heck would happen if someone like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EvH5LQAYl0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> used that program?</p>

            <p>Interesting concept but I don’t feel like it would help immersion in a game. People can to easily screw with the system and break immersion, especially in realistic war games.</p>
