            <p>I had that problem too! But its gone now. It’s the driver that affects the model. Don’t update it with Steam. Go to the driver’s website and download their latest driver (The one that says automatically choose driver)</p>

            <p>Hello How are you? I could solve the problem of the textures (so far) by doing the following: Removing the drivers of video card from Computer (right click) -&gt; Properties —&gt; (Option) Device Manager —&gt; Adapters screen —&gt; (right click) on ATI Radeon HD 4300/4500 Series (in my case) and then put uninstall.</p>
<pre><code>   Then Windows detect missing drives and automatically download and install.
</code></pre>
<p>That solved the problem regarding the textures, the only thing I still have to resolve the errors are displayed on the console, which apparently has something to do with the textures and graphics card, do not know much about these messages displayed on the console in red (see picture). Probare outlive following the steps in this post let me.</p>

            <p>Hello How are you? I could solve the problem of the textures (so far) by doing the following: Removing the drivers of video card from Computer (right click) -&gt; Properties —&gt; (Option) Device Manager —&gt; Adapters screen —&gt; (right click) on ATI Radeon HD 4300/4500 Series (in my case) and then put uninstall.</p>
<pre><code>   Then Windows detect missing drives and automatically download and install.
