    <title>Steam BMS Not Launching</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-bms-not-launching/13804</link>
    <description>I just bought the Steam version of BMS, and when i go to open it, it just shows that I&#39;m in game for a second, then nothing happens.
So far I&#39;ve tried opening in windowed mode, running as admin, re-installing it (also on different drives), restarting my comp, and verifying cache.
I can run the free mod just fine, it&#39;s just the steam version that doesn&#39;t work. Please help.

My computer specs are:
OS: Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit
Processor: AMD FX 8350 Eight-core (4.0GHz)
RAM: 8 GB
Graphics card: AMD Radeon R9 290</description>

            <p>I just decided to do a factory reset and revert to regular windows 8. This seemed to work. Thank you guys for your help in this matter.</p>

            <p>So do this COMPLETELY AT YOU OWN RISK, but if it happening with other Source engine games, try uninstalling all your directX versions. You can then install them again manually. I’ve personally never done this but I know other people have had to do it, so give it a Google and see if it helps. Quite the vexing problem.</p>

            <p>Another bit of information that could be helpful: the same thing seems to be going on with my copies of insurgency and the Stanley Parable. It could be an issue with source engine mods.</p>

            <p>Did you navigate out to the Black Mesa folder in Steam and run the .exe from there (with Steam running). You can also try running that .exe as an admin.</p>

            <p>I solved the problem for myself by creating a separate user account in Windows specifically for Steam. I’s a bit of a hassle, but it worked for me. Maybe it’ll work for you too.</p>

            <p>Make sure it isn’t launching in a foreign resolution, you can fix this by doing this in the startup specs:</p>
<p>-Fullscreen -Width First number on your monitor’s res -Height Second number</p>
