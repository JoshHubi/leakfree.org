3Ds Max model. Don&#39;t even ask how many poly&#39;s, I way overdid it because it was one of my first projects. I converted the file and shrunk it wrong, and so it&#39;s a little out of sync to the music, and there is a piece at the end there that says &quot;completely remastered&quot; which originally lasted about a second, but the compression screwed that up.
First and last time I try to use windows movie maker to convert a movie.

I think I still have the high quality version that is synced better, I might upload it at some point.</description>

            <p>That’s pretty awesome dude! I like all the effects. One thing i dont like is how the ipod’s color looks very flat and not shiny. Nonetheless, great work.</p>
