This is a great concept. I love the idea of a cheap videogame console that can deliver quality (hopefully) content to badass man caves. Now, the developers themselves will make or break this thing, and of course there&#39;s the matter of hardware. I&#39;m not that concerned about the power though tbh, especially since it&#39;s seemingly 100% open. I just love this idea so god damn much.</description>

<p>This all sounds awesome, but I’m a bit worried about the f2p model.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think they said that each game just has to be free in some way.  For instance, a free demo.  But you can charge for the full game.  Don’t double quote me on that though.</p>
<p>I’m a little concerned about the specs though.  I know the emphasis is put on smaller and indie games but if they’re really trying to market themselves as a serious competitor, then it may not hold up as well.  The OnLive integration really helps that though.  But not everyone’s internet connection is fast enough to handle that.  Not to mention, OnLive itself isn’t really all there yet.  1.5 GHz or whatever the Tegra 3 chip has really isn’t a lot.  And I do believe that the Tegra 3 supports up to 2gb of RAM, and Ouya only has 1gb.  I know I’m kind of missing the point of the Ouya, but it’s still a concern to be mentioned.  Especially since the new Xbox is rumored to have an Intel chipset/CPU and 8gb or possibly even 12gb or RAM.  I’m a little worried that Ouya won’t be able to keep up.</p>

            <p>If you had the Incredible 2 you could overclock to 1.7ghz like I did on mine.</p>
<p>Maybe you can anyway, I heard they are very similar phones except for the GPU.</p>

<p>Well on my phone, for n64oid, you can either only use the control stick <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">OR</span></span> the dpad, but not at the same time. They’re pretty responsive for me, running on an HTC Incredible</p>

<p>Yeah, I was looking at Boost because they reasonable plans, but sadly the service is awful where I live. I just got a Virgin Mobile prepaid, works for me pretty well.</p>

<p>With my PS3 controller? Perfect except for the right analog stick, which copies the left one.</p>
<p>With the touchscreen? Let’s just say I prefer playing on my Droid 2 because it has a hardware qwerty keyboard.</p>
<p>Age of empires? Perfect on touchscreen of course, but the keyboard helps to type those cheats  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> .</p>

            <p>The only thing which drives me to buy a new platform is if it has decent exclusives or does something revolutionary that nothing else can do.</p>
<p>Yes it is impressive the amount of money this project has raised, but my computer can do everything this can do, and much much more. If I want to play a game like I do on a console, I just plug in a controller. If I want to play on a big TV screen, I plug it into a big TV screen.</p>
<p>Yes my computer was expensive, but most gamers would already have one, or at least get one when they get older and richer. It’s good for parents to buy their kids a cheap console, but it concerns me that the vast majority of games will likely be crap. I’m thinking it’ll be like the games market on the apple store.</p>
<p>It does look like a neat little box, and would be handy for emulation, but I do everything legit so it’s of not much use to me. Even if I did decide to wear an eye patch I could do it all on the computer, and most likely better.</p>
<p>F2P I think will cause issues. For existing titles to be ported everything will need to be modified to support this. A timer could be imposed upon games to end it after half an hour, but with an open console I see people hacking this and even hacking the market to the point where they set up a whole other market full of roms and pirated stuff.</p>
<p>It seems to me like a bad idea to try and make money off a console that welcomes hackers and therefore piracy. Unless of course they’ve made their money and will now disappear without a trace  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>On top of all of this, I doubt it will play Black Mesa Source.</p>

<p>I am considering backing this project just for this.  Everything else would be a bonus.  Are there N64 or PS1 emulators for Android?  I know 16 bit and under are going to be covered…</p>
<p>This thing has the potential to change everything.  The problem is, the masses won’t buy it if they can’t play the newest Call of Duty on it.  I hope they make some announcements about some nice exclusives. (or at least some awesome "me too!"s before the preorders sell out, if they don’t I’ll have to wait until after launch, and reconsider)</p>

<p>emulators out the ass.</p>

</aside>
<p>I am considering backing this project just for this.  Everything else would be a bonus.  Are there N64 or PS1 emulators for Android?  I know 16 bit and under are going to be covered…</p>
<p>This thing has the potential to change everything.  The problem is, the masses won’t buy it if they can’t play the newest Call of Duty on it.  I hope they make some announcements about some nice exclusives. (or at least some awesome "me too!"s before the preorders sell out, if they don’t I’ll have to wait until after launch, and reconsider)</p>
