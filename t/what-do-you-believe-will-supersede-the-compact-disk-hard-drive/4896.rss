    <title>What do you believe will supersede the compact disk? Hard drive?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-do-you-believe-will-supersede-the-compact-disk-hard-drive/4896</link>
    <description>I have been pondering this for a while

I was wondering to myself. What will come supersede the CD-ROM as a way of cheap and easy portable storage? What will supersede the Hard Drive as a way of main storage?

When will we start seeing the next generation of storage platforms?

Allow me to address the anxieties underlying your concerns, rather than leave every possible question you might have left, unvoiced. 

I think what will replace hard drives as a storage platform is flash memory. Seeing as that is becoming more able to store more memory


As for the Compact Disk, I&#39;m not so sure. Maybe a crystal perhaps??</description>

            <p>I hate this shit. I always want a physical copy of a game, not just files from over the internet.</p>
<p>And if that onlive thing is any indicator of the future…god.</p>
<p>We will eventually have entire computers we buy over the internet and play through our own - essentially connecting to the internet to use something miles away from us to play games. Almost like watching a video of a good computer, except we’d be playing it.</p>

            <p>Hard drives will most likely be replaced by SSD’s once they become cheaper and can hold more storage. CD’s and DVD’s have been dying out due to internet downloads such as Itunes, Netflix streaming, app stores, etc. So it’s only a matter of time before they’re completely replaced.</p>

            <p>The future is cloud based system for almost everything. it’s may not be the next generation of tech, but it’s coming. people will begin to start buying licenses to play games, and not actually own them, publishers will push out the middle man and digitally distribute. Oh and the servers will use <a href="https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/06/billion-year-data-storage/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">these</a></p>
<p>it’s only going to get worse, corporations will suck the internet dry until it’s run like television. believe it or not, but this is the golden age of free information.</p>

            <p>CDs may be cheap, but you can’t fit anything on them anymore. DVDs are slow to write, but BluRay is what’s big enough to fit lots of data. BluRay discs cost a hell of a lot of money, so USB flash drives compete with them in price, with less storage. I think with a bit of time, Flash Memory will beat mechanical drives. It will be worth it for many reasons: no moving parts, takes up less physical space, could be re-used, less waste, etc… Hard drives are not the future either, look at the new MacBook Air, it uses Flash memory. I’m sure that in 10 years every computer will have Flash storage.</p>

<p>i’m pretty sure that’s how it actually is legally, and thats why valve can just take all your shit away for absolutely no reason</p>
<p>you’re renting it from them if you got it on steam, you don’t own it so they can terminate it for any reason at all</p>

            <p>Alot of companies are implementing full digitalisation, such as itunes for music, steam for games, alas not all games are supported with steam so it can be problematic in that scenario, besides, i like to have a HARD COPY of what i have, such as my music cd instead of internet/mp3/amazon/itunes, ya feel me?</p>

<p>Space Meat. The future of data is in Space Meat.</p>
<p>It all started in 1962. Utilizing advances in modern food synthesis, scientists at NASA began working on a germ hostile Space Meat. To be used during long expeditions into deep space. Only recently has their hard work paid off, as even more advances in the field of space meat have been made and applied to what is now called “Operation Meat”.</p>

<p>Not having access to this technology, most companies make theirs out of napkins.</p>
<p>Also, cloud storage isn’t a good choice for anything large (low speed of internet connections), anything personal (people freak out when their ISPs store search data, they’re not going to be okay with a company handling all their files), anything sensitive (exactly how secure is a file you transmit over the Internet?), or anything critical to have at a moment’s notice (you can’t trust your ISP to never go down), which makes it…mostly useless. There may be a future for cloud computing, but for cloud storage, almost certainly not.</p>
