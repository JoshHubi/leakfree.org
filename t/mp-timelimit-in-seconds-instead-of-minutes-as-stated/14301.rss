    <title>mp_timelimit in seconds instead of minutes as stated</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mp-timelimit-in-seconds-instead-of-minutes-as-stated/14301</link>
    <description>mp_timelimit is in seconds instead of minutes like other source games (TF2, CSS etc).
This causes problems with things like [url=&#39;https://www.sourcemod.net/&#39;]Sourcemod[/url] with mapchooser voting, since it sees it as minutes, not seconds - meaning no voting will show up. Would it be possible to change it back to minutes?

[code]mp_timelimit
&quot;mp_timelimit&quot; = &quot;900&quot; ( def. &quot;0&quot; )
 game notify replicated
 - game time per map in minutes[/code]</description>
