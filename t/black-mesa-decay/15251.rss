Something I made up during the break.

I didn&#39;t see any Decay remakes in the Source Engine, so I think it deserves a work.[/size][/align]</description>

<p>I agree! I am very excited to see the fruits of your labor and I am very interested in this project.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>My current proposal would be something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The player(s?) start on a tram in some unseen part of the facility.</li>
<li>They merge into the Sector C line (i.e. the part seen in bm_c0a0c) by coming <span class="bbcode-i">up</span> from this elevator shaft, since it also has an access from below:<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/851598802846143889/2C9C271EE0B89492DFDF2C1702A5877E72D0ABED/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/851598802846143889/2C9C271EE0B89492DFDF2C1702A5877E72D0ABED/" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1920×1080</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div>
</li>
<li>They then continue on <span class="bbcode-i">past</span> the first Sector C station through here:<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/851598802846155311/C9F50CF3DB05B797750E06FEACEA3C4A08E17AFB/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/851598802846155311/C9F50CF3DB05B797750E06FEACEA3C4A08E17AFB/" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1920×1080</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div>
</li>
<li>The tram then stops at the start of Dual Access, which could either be just after the actual tram platform or modified to accommodate it:<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mUTloxl.png" alt="" width="161" height="81">
</li>
<li>After going through security, they reach an area similar to the guarded door in bm_c1a0a, where they are required to get hazard suits to proceed.</li>
<li>They go through a door that turns out to be the other side of this door in bm_c1a0a…<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/851598802846168795/1351B843F1A562BA19042F33DDC95F4224632B4C/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/851598802846168795/1351B843F1A562BA19042F33DDC95F4224632B4C/" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1920×1080</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div>… and get their suits from the same locker room as Gordon. I don’t think this is the <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> door connecting the two Sector C areas (it’s rather small, and positioned weirdly close to the personnel areas but far from everything else), but it’s probably the only one we can go through.</li>
<li>They then go back through that door and are allowed deeper into Dual Access.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Possibly, but I think the intention when Gearbox made Decay was for the other two, empty HEV containers in AM to be Gina and Collette’s.<br>
There’s also another solution to this issue I just thought of - the redesigned AM labs have a section past the “Wrong” airlock that’s caved in, and also an elevator - maybe one of those could lead to the airlock in Dual Access? Technically, we don’t know for sure the spawn area in DA was a tram station - we never saw a tram or tram line, just the inside of an airlock.</p>

            <p>I dunno, <span class="bbcode-i">I</span> for one thought the HEV suit was weirdly far away from where it was used as is. I think having another suit room in the service area of AM would be a good addition.</p>

            <p>bm_c1a0 is in the mapsrc folder, could be done. Though I don’t know if most players would want to have to get off a tram, trek through AM, get their suit, then backtrack to the tram station only to sit on the tram for longer.</p>

            <p>Some people on the Russian forums were talking about having the game start on the tram-ride in instead of just dropping the player in a station, and actually allowing you to go and pick up your suit. I think that’d be a neat addition.</p>

            <p>That is a fair point.</p>
<p>Also something to keep in mind is that the area of AM seen in Dual Access seems to be entirely labs and server rooms to support the Anti-Mass Spectrometer’s operation, so there wouldn’t be much in the way of staff areas down there - Maybe a bathroom or two. Anything else they’d probably just grab the tram back to the main area of Sector C for.</p>

            <p>It’s taken me a while to figure out just what was bothering me about these maps, and just now it’s hit me that they’re a very “literal” reconstruction of the originals- similar geometry, layout, etc.</p>
<p>The Black Mesa maps are overall much more of a reinterpretation, which helps make them look less ‘barren’ and ‘contrived’. I’d suggest reducing each area down to just a set of bullet points (like the above two would be “catwalk leading to a tram station” and "long corridor with a security office behind one wall) and redeveloping the areas from there without looking at the originals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while it’s good that you’re keeping to the texture sets used in the Black Mesa analogues of these areas, it needs to be a bit more granular than chapter-by-chapter- personnel and security areas in AM have a different texture set than materials/logistics areas, and then there are at <span class="bbcode-i">least</span> two if not more sets for labs. Not everything should be the same “white striped metal wall” texture. Conversely, I think you should also be applying the concept of these ‘sets’ to level geometry- that window immediately stands out to me as something that belongs in Questionable Ethics since all of the AM windows are square, for instance.</p>

            <p>There have been a ton of attempted remakes of Decay in the Source engine but I’m pretty sure literally all of them have died before really getting anywhere. Your stuff looks good - maybe a few odd angles, like I don’t know exactly what’s going on on top of that security door in the last shot you posted, it looks really weird, but overall I think it’s pretty great for early shots, really reminiscent of Gearbox’s brushwork style on the HL expansions. Put some atmospheric details like fog and enhance the lighting a bit and you’ll be well on your way!</p>
<p>Are you planning on making the entire Decay campaign, or just Dual Access?</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh, so I guess there were other Decay remake maps for Black Mesa? Well, I been known for bad googling skills so I really should have expected that.</p>
<p>I do think some brushworks and textures are rushed, after all, I made this in a single day (Gevanni helped me do it in a single night, if anyone gets the reference here). And I was most likely getting crazy during the last time too. And it’s my first time working on Anomalous Materials labs. I only worked on QE lab since.</p>
<p>But I’m not sure exactly which of them are wrong. I mean, it does feel wrong for most parts for me, but can’t pinpoint. I did try go and re do some of them today.</p>
<p>Some big changes I removed the big… thing, and replaced them with the pipes. And worked more on the trims.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8IsH2jF.png" alt="" width="161" height="81"></p>
<p>… And the ceiling things.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rFBHb6L.png" alt="" width="161" height="81"></p>
<p>It’s not shown in the picture but I added some more wall details later on.</p>
<p>I personally have gripes about that window. I didn’t like it from the beginning, really. I think it’s unnecessary long and dull. But believe me, I tried several different versions, this is quite the best as of yet. Maybe I’ll try more different design.</p>

            <p>Very good job indeed, especially with the lights! But I agree with Crypt, you need to rework a bit on the textures where they meet, it just seems weird. Also that vent looks like it’s litterally going through the wall, it seems a bit wrong</p>
