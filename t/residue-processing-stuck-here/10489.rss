            <p>Never mind, I used noclip to view the level, and it seem that the route through must have been changed at some time. This hatch is no longer the way to the next area.</p>

            <p>Hi folks, please help. How do I open this gate and reverse the conveyor direction to get through? Every other video/picture I see of this area, the gate my cross hairs are on is open with a trip-mine.</p>

            <p>Hi there, thx to the devs for this great renewal !!</p>
<p>I’m stuck on the last part of this chapter : in the room where you have to pull a lever to move a hanging platform in front of a door at the middle of the room.<br>
It seems like a bug, because from what I saw on walkthroughs, the door is supposed to open automatically once the lever is down, but it is not the case for me !</p>
<p>here is a screenshot with the lever down and the door closed :<br>
<img src="https://img4.hostingpics.net/pics/480485residueprocessing2.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>I tried everything, pulled it back and retry, pulled half, stop and continue ,reload different saves, restart computer…nothing, the door just wont open  :s</p>
<p>Any trick ? or even a cheat to make that door open ?</p>

<p>I can’t get past the first set of crushers. My usual trick is to run up against the first one (with sprint on); when the crusher goes up you then sprint past. This used to work fine (I played through this a few months ago and didn’t have too much trouble) but now it doesn’t - I’m getting squished by the third crusher every time. I’ve tried thirty times or more, no luck. I see earlier posts in this thread from others having the same problem.</p>

<p>Sorry you are having issues. We’ve never seen the issue on the dev side, but we have seen a couple of posts of people not able to get through. We will look at it again for the final release.</p>
<p>Some things you can try:</p>
<p>No clipping through would be the fastest.</p>
<p>Load a couple saves prior and see if the issue is resolved. Something strange may have knocked the pistons out of timing.</p>
<p>Type status in console, make note of the map name (I think it is bm_c2a4c, but I can’t be sure). Then type “map bm_c2a4c” into console. This will start the map as a new game.</p>
<p>Worst case you can go to “New Game” then start the chapter over, and see if the problem persists.</p>
<p>What are your system specs?</p>

            <p>You shouldn’t quit the whole game due to one obstacle.</p>
<p>You could always just sv_cheats 1; godmode 1;<br>
through the last one.</p>
<p>and then type<br>
godmode 0; sv_cheats 0;<br>
and continue.</p>
<p>or noclip if needed.</p>
<p>Tho the other levels might get some updates when they release xen, who knows.</p>

            <p>I should have been clearer. I was able to set sv_gravity to 600 (earlier post said it <em>should</em> be 600) at which point I could make the jump and get past that obstacle.</p>
<p>Now I’m stuck farther on (sigh) , I can’t get past the first set of crushers. My usual trick is to run up against the first one (with sprint on); when the crusher goes up you then sprint past. This used to work fine (I played through this a few months ago and didn’t have too much trouble) but now it doesn’t - I’m getting squished by the third crusher every time. I’ve tried thirty times or more, no luck. I see earlier posts in this thread from others having the same problem. Looks like something else changed in a recent update. This isn’t fun any more so I’m giving up for now and playing Ethan Carter instead. Maybe whatever changed will change back if there’s another update released soon.</p>

            <p>I just want to bypass this damned jump. I’ve been trying to get from the catwalk onto that rotor for like 45 minutes and the one time I managed it, I fell right into the green goo and couldn’t climb out before dissolving. Tried all the suggestions here. I don’t know how to start the game in dev mode so I can’t check the gravity setting. All I know right now is I’m sick of this part and I just want to get past it. This jump is just a pain in the neck. I’ve had to save and exit; if I can’t get past it tomorrow I guess I’ll go play <span class="bbcode-i">Sir, You Are Being Hunted</span> for a couple of days and come back to this when I feel like messing with it.</p>

<p>You can use “sv_unlockedchapters 15” in console without quotes to unlock all the chapters and then just pick up where you left off. If you don’t know you activate the console by going to options&gt;keyboard&gt;advanced&gt;enable developer console. Quoted from Atom-Bomb</p>

<p>If that means I should crouch BEFORE I jump, no. I just tried it and fell flat.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it makes a difference that I’m using keyboard, but I haven’t had any difficulty with jumping puzzles up to here.</p>
<p>It has always felt that my guy is a lousy jumper. Does my exhausted power suit make a difference? Any idea on how to increase jumping height or range?</p>
<p>Hey! I just made it. Secret was to hit W and Shift almost simultaneously, then Space. Took several tries though, and of course I fell in the first time. You can bet I made a Quick-Save as soon as I got onto the rotating beam!</p>

<p>There are some difficult jumps in our game, but it overall shouldn’t be that tough. No, suit power doesn’t affect jump distance. I wonder if this is as a result of a bug (which we thought we fixed a long time ago, but may not have succeeded in doing so).</p>
<p>Could you check something for me, if you know how? Could you please open the developer console, while the game is running (use the tilde key, normally to the left of the 1 key on your keyboard), and type</p>
<p>sv_gravity</p>
<p>Then press enter. It will tell you what the game’s value for sv_gravity is set to. The value should be 600. If it is 800, then our bug has not been fixed, and we’ll need to look at it again! We had a weird bug before we launched the game last year, where gravity would keep setting itself to 800, when it was meant to be 600. This makes jumping considerably harder, as you get way less breathing room on all the jumps. It wouldn’t make the game unbeatable, just much harder in an unfun way.</p>

<p>Guess it’s been a long time since anybody’s had a problem with Residue but I can’t seem to make the jump shown in the picture. I’ve watched a video and tried it with Sprint assist about fifty times from different starting positions. My guy always falls about an inch short. Any hope?</p>

<p>The three big thumpers on the conveyors. I have no clue how to get past them.Edit: very careful timing. Right-o.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the left far back corner there a tall carton. Above it there’s an opening to the platform above. Move a few barrels near the tall carton, get on the carton and lift a barrel to the top of the carton. Climb up and stand on the barrel and hop up to the platform. Avoid the piston platforms completely.</p>
<p>Sorry, I thought you were referring to the three big pistons and vats before the area you are referring to.</p>
<p>Never mind.</p>

            <p>VERY much appreciated.  Kept falling off the conveyor before being able to make the jump to that last conveyor.  Going great now.  Thanks again.  Wonderful remake, just beautiful!</p>

            <p><span class="spoiler">1. Go into the laser tripmine tunnel seen in <a href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/521637598942217827/CDD11021959C33311109668800C3A7136A5C57A6/" data-bbcode="true">this screenshot</a>.<br>
2. You will approach another laser tripmine and a crushing roller as seen in <a href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/521637598943651430/5295E7232BA0F783EC476EB0DCD212DEC7C04078/" data-bbcode="true">this screenshot</a>.<br>
3. Don’t get crushed by the roller!  Jump over to <a href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/521637598943651571/3712DC521B92A1C12449F585B8D07899B7CF4F1A/" data-bbcode="true">this conveyor belt</a> instead.<br>
4. Jump back and forth between the conveyor belts until you reach <a href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/521637598943651773/8574E8791F6EF6578A733C089E7ADC9D8757C852/" data-bbcode="true">this tunnel</a>.<br>
5. There are <a href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/521637598943651880/522BF67BF773D560D810663C75B3E929F065DC99/" data-bbcode="true">two options here</a>.  One: jump towards the ladder or two: get shredded by the massive rotating blades.  I recommend option number 1.<br>
</span><br>
This should get you out of conveyor belt city.  Let me know if you have any other questions.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Been through that, found my way to the room with water at the bottom, opened the door to the corridor, opened the other doors, explored all the other rooms… and they seem to lead nowhere.  I discovered a great deal of real estate, but it all seems to be dead-ends; I wind up running around in circles.  I’m obviously missing something, and by now, I’ve been round and round so often that I’m not seeing it with new eyes anymore; I’m probably walking right by it and just not seeing it 'cause I’ve been by it so many times already.  Perhaps a more pointed hint, or a screenshot?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
