            <p>So I’m in the airlock room (reminds me of Black Mesa East’s airlocks  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ) and the “lead” scientist has asked me to “take a look.”  What the heck does he want me to do?!  I went up and looked at the security cameras, I ran all up and down the hallway…halp!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit:</span></p>
<p>Turns out Mr. Scientist was stuck.  Reloaded from the autosave in the crematory and it worked fine.</p>

            <p>I’ve played through QE a few times and it seems quite a short (but very good) chapter.</p>
<p>Just played it again today (30/9/13) and again it’s a very good chapter but does seem short. In the ambush room there’s a second floor. It would be nice to somehow access that floor.</p>

            <p>Hi there, I just joined because I lost my new gun. I got the gun with the orange laser (tau cannon?) and I took a few shots with it and then I got into a little fight and lost it. I thought maybe I dropped it but it doesn’t seem to be on the floor. Can someone help me get it back?</p>

            <p>I’m having a problem in this chapter. I kill all of the soldiers, the scientists come in and blab near the door, then just stand there. They won’t let me out.</p>
<p>This has got to be a bug right? I didn’t have this problem the first time I played through the game. Is there a way to manually load the next map?</p>
<p>EDIT: Nevermind, I just started a new game at Surface Tension and went on from there. I forgot you could do that.</p>

<p>Shoot the first few that rappel down, then immediately shoot the ones that are on the roof shooting down at you.</p>
<p>Then basically just hide behind the metal crates near the back and wait for them to approach you. Some of them drop medkits, so make sure to look out for them.</p>

            <p>Crossbow is your best friend. Stay at the bottom of the stairs where you enter the room. Turn it into your personal little foxhole. That way you cannot ever get flanked from behind, and the stairs provide excellent cover and concealment.</p>

<p>You have to turn on all lasers in optronics center to activate the main “laser cannon” (the one with two headcrabs as targets). When the cannon is ready, disconnect the plug at the right side of the headcrabs and fire the laser.</p>
<p>The laser will make a hole in the wall and you’ll be able to pass through, falling in the cremators area. The scientists room is in front of the cremators.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>and that is where i am stuck</p>
<p>did exactly that, but got no hole in the wall,<br>
after running around for 10 minutes and getting the guard from last loadscreen killed (did not find any scientists to open any doors either…?) i returned to the console and it was invisible! (textures gone!?)<br>
(just the glows of the buttons were still there and they were still interactable)<br>
also i have found no scientists alive anywhere, no idea what doors you guys are talking about here…</p>
<p>just the glows of the buttons were still there and interactable… saved / loaded / loaded previous auto save but the console stays invisible, i guess i’ll have to load a save from far earlier now (where all the green trickjump pots were <em>ugh</em>)</p>
<p>//edit:<br>
and as always 10 seconds after this post i found my error…<br>
i did disconnect the power plug AFTER i pressed the fire button, you have to remove the plug BEFORE you press the power button, for some reason i thought the lights stay red if you try that</p>
<p>anyway here is a screenshot of the invisible console: <a href="https://img6.imagebanana.com/img/sn0mv9vw/hl22012092110265636.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://img6.imagebanana.com/img/sn0mv9vw/hl22012092110265636.png</a><br>
not sure what happened there, it was visible at first but then this all of a sudden.</p>
<p>anyway moving on now.</p>

<p>They have some samples in there brought back from the borderworld, and use it to test potential chemical (In this case Cyanogen Chloride - yes I know its clear in reality, but invisible looks bad.</p>

<p>They might have put a colorant in the gas so they know that the room X has been filled by gas and needs to be cleaned before enter!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Also, I came to say that even though this is not a request for help, the last fight is very tough, even on medium. with 100/83 took me almost 10 tries to beat it, and at that point I had learnt every spawn spot, and I was firing as they were spawning. Talks someone who plays on the hardest difficulties usually (I’m talking about fps), so I see why someone had to complain about the marines.</p>
