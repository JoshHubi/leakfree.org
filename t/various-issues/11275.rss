    <description>Game randomly crashes with the Windows error message &quot;Hl2.exe has stopped working&quot;

I saved a game and upon resuming, my weapons had disappeared. Well actually it showed my machine gun selected with ammo remaining, but when I tried to fire it clicked as though empty and my machine gun, grenades, and shotgun had gone leaving only my pistol, crowbar and backpack bombs. Weird.

Random game freezes lasting for a few seconds.

I got the helicopter bug.</description>
