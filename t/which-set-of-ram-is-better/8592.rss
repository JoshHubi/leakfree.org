    <title>Which Set of RAM is Better?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/which-set-of-ram-is-better/8592</link>
    <description>I was on Newegg and comparing these two models of Corsair ram.  They seem to be almost exactly the same except for a the color and some small features.  Which set would be better?

Newegg Comparison: [url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Productcompare.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=-1&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=corsair%20ram&amp;bop=And&amp;CompareItemList=-1%7C20-233-144%5E20-233-144-05%23%2C20-145-345%5E20-145-345-TS&#39;]https://www.newegg.com/Product/Productcompare.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=-1&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=corsair%20ram&amp;bop=And&amp;CompareItemList=-1%7C20-233-144%5E20-233-144-05%23%2C20-145-345%5E20-145-345-TS[/url]

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There was nothing filled out incorrectly. The only difference between the two is the color of the heat spreader. The EDI fields for that variance probably didn’t even exist to be filled out. The ‘form’ consists of a computer program with fields that are mandatory to be filled out prior to submission and acceptance by the retailer/distributor. Marketing information is NOT submitted with the EDI transmission. So, if a new product is available it can be transmitted and be shown for sale even though the marketing material isn’t even ready yet. In this case, they could have figured it’s no big deal or perhaps they had submitted the marketing info but it wasn’t published yet or any other number of reasons.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">No difference in performance?</span><br>
Significant differences in performance based on types of chips used, config of chips and EPROM programming as well as grade of modules.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"> In the end it’s just a piece of board with a bunch of memory chips on it.</span><br>
Is it a 4 layer board or a 6 layer board or an eight layer board?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">A bunch of chips?</span><br>
Are they x4 modules, x8 modules or x16 modules?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Every chips has to be built by certain industry standards,</span><br>
The “industry standard” you’re referring to is called JEDEC standards. However, a company can build a 1GB module with 32 chips, 16 chips, 8 chips or even 4 chips and they can all total 1GB. That doesn’t mean that it will work with your chipset or in set configurations on a board even though they are built to JEDEC specifications. Companies even take chips and overclock them and then hide them by installing a heat spreader to hide their deeds.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">every chip is significantly the same.</span><br>
No they aren’t There are differences in chips, programming and quality of build.</p>
<p>Are there differences in chips?<br>
You damn right there is!</p>

<p>I’m guessing since they have the same model number, aside from the blue one having “B” on the end, they are the same.  All of the other differences look like someone just didn’t enter them right into Newegg’s database.</p>

</aside>
<p>Product descriptions are actually supplied by the manufacturer. They input information through a system called EDI and then email product images. Typically, the retailer doesn’t even stock the items but transmits orders, again through EDI, to the supplier who ships from their location.</p>
<p>And yes, they are the same. The manufacturers P/N is CMZ8GX3M2A1600C9B and is interpreted as follow:</p>
<p>CMZ…Corsair Memory, (Z probably represents retail packaged as opposed to OEM trays)[/SIZE]<br>
8G…8GB<br>
X3…Intel XMP Supported DDR3<br>
M2…Number of Modules=2<br>
A1600…(PC3-12800, 1600MHz)<br>
C9…CAS Latency=9<br>
B…Blue Heat Shield</p>

            <p>I was on Newegg and comparing these two models of Corsair ram.  They seem to be almost exactly the same except for a the color and some small features.  Which set would be better?</p>
