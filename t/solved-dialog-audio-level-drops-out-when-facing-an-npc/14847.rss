    <title>[Solved] Dialog audio level drops out when facing an NPC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/solved-dialog-audio-level-drops-out-when-facing-an-npc/14847</link>
    <description>Greetings,

I just started my first play-through and am having an issue where if I am facing the person talking to me, I can barely hear what they are saying - but as soon as I turn the mouse away from facing them, the dialog goes back to full volume and I can hear everything perfectly.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Thanks.

SOLVED:  For some reason my headphones setup had a phase reversal issue which caused this problem.  Fixed my audio issue, and now it&#39;s working as indended.</description>
