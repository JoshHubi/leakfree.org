    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-will-never-get-to-enjoy-this-game/11512</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve given up on trying to get this game to work. Steam on both of my laptops is shoddy, SDK Source took me a month of trying to download with the constant message &quot;Steam servers are currently too busy to handle your request&quot; until recently it somehow worked (I tried changing my location but that never fixed it), then Black Mesa would give me the message &quot;This game is currently unavailable&quot; whenever I tried to open it.  I updated drivers, reinstalled the game several times, rebooted, and now I tried reinstalling SDK Source... and I&#39;m getting the &quot;Steam servers are currently too busy to handle your request&quot; message again (Goddamn SDK Source can&#39;t be downloaded any other way?).  I&#39;ve given up on trying to get it to work.

Tell me, what exactly am I missing out on?</description>

<p>Couldn’t hold myself. And I’m glad to have played it already, even though the overall impression might not had been as good as it would if I did wait for the full release.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’d say my new laptop (that I bought as a result of the Steam Summer sale) is above-average in performance.  My last one could hardly run the original Red Orchestra. And if somehow I could get the game to work, I have 10 days until I leave for a 6 year commitment…</p>
