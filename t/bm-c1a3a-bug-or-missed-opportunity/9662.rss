    <title>bm_c1a3a - Bug or missed opportunity?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bm-c1a3a-bug-or-missed-opportunity/9662</link>
    <description>I am loving this mod so far, but I can&#39;t help but feel that this is a missed opportunity for an environmental kill.

When you see the first HECU Marine, he&#39;s standing underneath a suspended box with what appear to be the controls nearby.  
Pressing the interact key or smashing the panel with the crowbar doesn&#39;t cause to box to fall and smash the guy, It doesn&#39;t appear like you can shoot the cables supporting the box either.
Is this a bug, am I missing something, or is there not scripting for something like that?</description>

            <p>I ended up throwing that blue tank of bubble bath at him and just shooting that. The box drp would have been way more interesting!</p>

            <p>Glad to see that I’m not the only one with this issue.  Hoping that they add it in, dropping the box on him makes too much sense to not happen</p>

<p>I spent a solid three or four minutes trying to figure out how to drop that box.  I wound up just shooting him in the head, but it felt like it was laid out too perfectly NOT to crush him.</p>
