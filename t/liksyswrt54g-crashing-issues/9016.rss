    <title>Liksyswrt54g crashing issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/liksyswrt54g-crashing-issues/9016</link>
    <description>Edit: Title is dumb, it&#39;s a LInksys wrt54GL, not G.

Let me start by saying I think wireless technology is the most unreliable steaming heap of shit ever made.

Anyway, I had DSL, a shit wifi card and an expensive but nonetheless shit router. I had connection issues etc. Bought a nicer wireless card. Connection issues. Switched from DSL to Comcast. Connection issues. Switched to a wrt54GL client bridge set up to replace my wifi card. Connection issues. Got a wrt54GL for the wifi router. Connecion issues. Bought a laptop with a really nice wifi card. Connection issues. So here I am now. With motherfucking connection issues.

Tl;Dr useless rant, just skip over.

So I have a laptop and a liksyswrt54GL wireless router and, on my desktop, a liksyswrt54GL with a client bridge set up. I often experience really bad lag spikes while gaming. Often in the form of freezing anywhere from 5-60 seconds. Sometimes, the internet just crashes and I have to unplug the router ad plug it back in. On top of that, the router randomly resets itself going to the default liksys wifi network settings. The crashes usually occur during gaming, but also occur, without fail, when two or more people are using the internet at once. Especially when two or more are gaming. They seem to have been getting much much worse over the course of the last 3 months. Just a couple minutes ago, the router completely died. All it&#39;s status lights were green and/or flashing indicating everything&#39;s fine, but our wifi network was cycling between non-existant and having no internet connectivity. Unplug and replug, multiple times, did nothing. Standing within two feet of the router did nothing. Ethernet cable did nothing. So I reset the thing and after a while it started working.

Anyone have an idea what is wrong with the piece of shit?

P.S. Went to post this only to find the god damn internet was down again and the wireless network had disappeared. Unplug and replug, posting in the few minute window before the fucking thing is going to crash again.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am using my DSL modem’s on-board wifi because my WRT54G v7 is less reliable, tried every custom firmware. I suggest you ditch wireless gaming and buy a new WIFI router, go with Belkin, Netgear, or anything but Linksys. Even though you can get them for like 15$ on tigerdirect.</p>
<p>By the way USB adapters can be good or bad regardless of brand or model, you need to look at the chip inside or check driver ID. I find atheros chips to be the most stable.</p>

            <p>Might change my sig, it’s a 3 year old joke directed at Dias for having a similar sig, only Christian themed.</p>
<p>Yeah, I noticed 90% of routers out there had horrible customer reviews going on about connection issues, so I went with the only one that seemed to have good reviews. What do you know? Connection issues.</p>
