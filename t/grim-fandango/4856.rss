    <title>Grim Fandango</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/grim-fandango/4856</link>
    <description>Decided to play this through again, an amazing game before Lucas Arts went down the drain with spin off starwars games.

It&#39;s a story driven adventure game released in 1998 written by Tim Schafer, it&#39;s still one of my favorite games to date, anyone else play it? If you havn&#39;t I strongly suggest playing it.

Story behind it
[quote]
Grim Fandango takes place in the Land of the Dead, where recently departed souls make their way to the Ninth Underworld. For sinners, this is a four-year journey made on foot, and many do not complete it, being eaten, &quot;sprouted,&quot; or ending up taking jobs at way-points along the route. However, more virtuous souls receive assistance, the most virtuous getting passage on the &quot;Number Nine&quot; train (&quot;Double N&quot;) that cuts the journey down to four minutes.  The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year, on November 2, there is a large festival celebration of the Day of the Dead.

<p>This.</p>
<p>GF is actually the only adventure game I’ve ever played (though I’ve played Phoenix Wright) and I couldn’t do anything. Every single time something had to happen I had to consult GameFaqs. I think the only puzzle I actually solved by myself in the game was having the birds peck the balloon and even then  it took me somewhere around 45 minutes to figure it out.</p>

<p>A-ha, that was caused by the patch! I always wondered why this dialogue wont start on my machine. I once got it to run but that seemed to be like a big coincidence.</p>
<p>Can’t the launcher put this trigger back into the game?</p>

            <p>I was about to question Manny’s appearance in the monkey island series Prior to 1998 but then I realized I’d been playing the Special Edition versions of those and he was probably put there as an in-joke by the Artists.</p>

            <p>GF is one of the great adventure games from LucasArts.<br>
I had managed to make it run flawlessly in Win XP SP3 a few years ago (the process mainly requiered installing the patch, using the launcher from quick.mixnmojo and setting the cpu affinity to 1). Haven’t tried it on Windows 7.</p>
<p>However, just a heads up, the official patch makes it impossible (for some reason which I am sure was not intentional) to trigger a very important dialogue that explains many of the basic plot points . Or at least this happened for me and many others, but I had already played the original version when it came out on Windows 98 SE and knew about the plot anyway.</p>
<p>Here’s the dialogue (warning: spoilers for anyone who has not played the game)<br>

<p>lucas arts adventure games are basically al lgreat and you cant fuck up permanenty like in certain annoying sierra games</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I actually like that about certain Sierra games, or the fact that you can solve certain puzzles in more than one way.  I like how actions early in the game can have repercussions later in the game.  For instance, in SQ4, if you forgot to write down the time machine destination code the first time you enter the cockpit, youre fucked and cannot return later in the game.  Technically youre forced to restart.  This is probably the worst and most annoying example I can think of from the SQ series. Another good one is forgetting to take the broken piece of glass from the escape pod in SQ1, although you encounter that mistake soon after.  Or in SQ2, if you forget to get the Labion Terror Beast whistle.</p>
<p>I am proud to say that i was able to complete all of the SQ series without walkthroughs when they were first released.  Its funny how quickly you can beat those games once you know how, but the initial attempt can take forever.  Just remember, if you play Sierra Adventure games, remember to make new saves often!</p>
<p>Sounds like I will have to give GF a shot.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve not played many Sierra adventures, only a couple of the Leisure Suit Larry ones in fact, so maybe I’m not the best to tell you. I would personally say it was just as good as any one of the Monkey Island games, or the first two Broken Swords (let’s face it, the 3D Broken Swords lost most of the charm). If you enjoy adventure games at all (particularly with a hint of humour to them) I’d definitely suggest you check it out.</p>

            <p>Not quite the fan of Adventure but I like when there’s a certain… spark.<br>
Grim Fandango certainly has that spark!<br>
Also a fan of Grim Fandango is a man named Yahtzee Croshaw, I’m sure you’ve heard of him, and he also has created a bunch of adventure games that are actually quite awesome.<br>

            <p>Decided to play this through again, an amazing game before Lucas Arts went down the drain with spin off starwars games.</p>
<p>It’s a story driven adventure game released in 1998 written by Tim Schafer, it’s still one of my favorite games to date, anyone else play it? If you havn’t I strongly suggest playing it.</p>
<p>Story behind it</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Grim Fandango takes place in the Land of the Dead, where recently departed souls make their way to the Ninth Underworld. For sinners, this is a four-year journey made on foot, and many do not complete it, being eaten, “sprouted,” or ending up taking jobs at way-points along the route. However, more virtuous souls receive assistance, the most virtuous getting passage on the “Number Nine” train (“Double N”) that cuts the journey down to four minutes.  The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year, on November 2, there is a large festival celebration of the Day of the Dead.</p>
