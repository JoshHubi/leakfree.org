    <title>Virus is rapin me</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/virus-is-rapin-me/7321</link>
    <description>So basically, i got this virus. I have an idea where i got it from, but whatever. Im posting from my fathers computer, because im currently trying my only option to save my harddrive, which is a system restore. I logged on today, with no BG on my desktop, windows 7 recovery system thing popped up, told me i had 40% of my hdd unreadable, my ram was running at like 87 degrees Celsius, and a bunch of other crap i cant remember atm. All of the files in my normal program files werent there, though i checked the properties of the folder and it said that it was filled as much as it was before. Program Files(x86) was untouched, and i could access any program in it from the start menu. I tried putting in the first disc of my recovery thing, but my computer wouldnt recognize the fact that it had anything on the disc, so upon restarting, i just booted back to the same blank desktop. (my folders were still on my desktop btw, and were accessible AFAIK.) I went to my startup options and set the disc as what i should boot from, but to no avail. i also tried booting in safe mode, but also, to no avail. It came down to the only thing i could do, was to boot, spam f8, and go to system repair, and system restore. Im not worried about losing anything on my computer, as all that is on it is games and music, and i can get it all back. Im curious if any of you have any recommendations, as to what i should do. I cant format, atm anyway, and thats what ive been trying to do the whole time. So like i said, any help is appreciated. (also, sorry no specs, but im pretty sure i dont need them, and also, im not the biggest computer expert, im just starting to learn the ropes around my hardware and such.)</description>

If it still is a mess even after you do system restore, or you can’t install any programs, do safe mode with networking and download and run the programs. That’s my cup of tea.

            <p>about making it run faster, try uninstalling all of your crap programs that you don’t need and never did.  they tend to build up after a while.  then type in “msconfig” in your search bar and go to startup or whatever it’s called and uncheck all the startup programs that you know just run and don’t do anything.  then download this excellent program called “ccleaner” and use it to clean your compooter.  worked for me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>btw. pretty much all programs that say they’ll make your computer faster are shit.</p>
<p>also: DEFRAG</p>

</aside>
<p>No worries, it´s a perfectly good question, let´s say you had a LIVE-CD of windows, the virus wouldn´t transfer as it´s loaded on ram, no actual files. This is why i mention before to scan the external hdd before he re-transfers his files back after reinstalling windows.</p>
<p>If he where however to transfer them to a mac or a linux install, this wouldn´t happen because regardless of wether mac or linux can get viruses (that´s a complete other discussion), they are different architectures, and the virus in question HAS been designed for windows, so it simply wouldn´t work on linux or OSX</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure it’s because of how the system is configured and where the system files are. Like if you have a virus for Windows it’s programmed to go to the system folders but on a Mac the folders the virus is programmed to go after are nonexistant so it can’t do anything.</p>

            <p>I looked at my processes, everything [COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">looked</span> normal, but idk. As far as a magnet and a dusty computer, i do run with the side panel off, but i keep it clean, and the only thing close to my computer is my xbox, but im pretty sure that shouldnt cause a problem. its ran fine for more than 5 months, as i set it up around christmas. It does run pretty hot though, could that maybe be a cause?</p>
<p>Edit: So i am posting this edit from my computer, the system restore appears to have done the trick, im going to make sure <span class="bbcode-b">EVERYTHING</span> is fine, but it is running slower than usual right now, which kind of concerns me.</p>

            <p>maybe try looking at what processes are running in the task manager.<br>
As long as you’re not had a magnet close to your hard drive or a dusty computer you might need to reformat somehow.<br>
Maybe buy a smaller hard drive next time and install windows onto that and keep all other files and stuff on a larger HDD.</p>
