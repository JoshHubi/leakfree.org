    <description>For some reason when i got to the part where you launch the rocket into space at the end of on a rail it crashes the game. When i open the door to the outside it has lagspike for 2 seconds then contiues. So i kill all the millitary troops and when i go up the ladder where you have to break to glass the game just quits running. It was working fine but now i cant even get pass the opening tram section without the game crashing. So is there a fix do i have a bad install please help me. :frowning:</description>

            <p>Go to “Steam\steamapps%username%\source sdk base 2007” and take the most recent .MDMP file, upload it, and post it. That’ll help the devs find the problem.</p>
<p>You can also try verifying the SDK Base 2007 game cache, and see if that fixes anything. If the games not even making it past the tram section, something in the Base probably got corrupted somehow.</p>
