    <description>First one: Create a thread about sugestions (like the old forum had). Or if you (moderator) want transform this thread right here into an &quot;Suggestions Thread&quot;.

Second one: Please add an animation for people being eaten by the barnacles. The way it is is buggy and strange. Altough I belive half life 2 was the same, you don&#39;t need to demote yourselves to the same level as Valve (that poor little company pff...)</description>

            <p>I think the new canon is that barnacles snap the necks of people instantly when they snatch them, hence why they become ragdolls. Gordon’s neck doesn’t snap because he’s that badass.</p>

<p>At least if there was a way to comment on just the suggestion itself,and see/hide the comments (utopian stuff).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It still wouldn’t be as simple as that. All comments are ordered chronologically, and there’s no way to discern a suggestion from any other comment. All the comments regarding various suggestions would be intermingled, the discussion would be unintelligible. It wouldn’t be a ‘thread’, it would be 50 discussions happening at the same time with no way of following any of them. And the suggestions themselves would be buried in an ocean of comment salad. It would be an incredible mess, even with a show/hide feature.</p>

<p>Right, there are a lot of suggestion threads, I understand where you’re coming from with this. There’s a trade-off with making a suggestion sticky: it might organize suggestions in one place, but in order to be useful, it couldn’t have discussion.  But as separate non-sticky threads, the suggestions can be discussed. The devs read all this stuff. They take feedback seriously. In a sticky, we wouldn’t be able to have discussion - that would be a huge mess.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree. Discussion is necessary indeed. At least if there was a way to comment on just the suggestion itself,and see/hide the comments (utopian stuff).</p>

            <p>The HL2 rebels had barnacle struggle animations. They were originally going to do that before Valve changed the barnacle tongues to a physics model.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s not that they want to do it, it’s just how the engine works. Changing it would cause it to big out more because none of the NPCs have death animations besides the barnacles anymore. I just don’t see how it’s possible. Maybe in another engine where there’s death animations, but with the current set up it’d be too much hassle.</p>
