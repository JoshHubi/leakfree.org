    <description>I&#39;m new to black mesa and i am playing i heard it ends at that time. Is it possible for you to continue the game. Also will you remake Blue Shift and oppising force.

            <p>Also, no, they’re not remaking blue shift and opposing force. Other teams are doing that. Next time you want to ask a question about mod related stuff, please use <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12508" data-bbcode="true">this</a> thread.</p>

            <p>Xen (the alien world) wasn’t included in the mod release but it will be released in the future when it’s ready.</p>
<p>No one knows when it will be ready, so it could either be next month or next year.</p>
