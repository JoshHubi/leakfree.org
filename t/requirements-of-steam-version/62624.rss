    <title>Requirements of Steam Version</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/requirements-of-steam-version/62624</link>
    <description>HI everyone, I&#39;m looking towards buying Steam version, because I finished a few days ago the Mod version, and loved every tiny bit of it.

But, I&#39;m wondering if my PC will be able to run it, since I can run okeyish the mod version. I have a 1gb video card, and a old i7 core, with 4 gb ram. Will be that okey to play at minimun at least?</description>

<p>And Xen will be playable? Or even worse than Surface tension for example?</p>

<p>Probably worse than surface tension. You can buy it, try out zen and see what you think and refund it if you’re not happy. If i was you I’d wait for it to come out of early access.<br>
