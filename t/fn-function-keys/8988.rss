    <title>Fn+function keys</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fn-function-keys/8988</link>
    <description>So when my friend got an asusg53sx I helped him set it up and in about 5 minutes set his function keys to work as volume/brightness/etc. keys without holding down fn and to only work as f1-f12 if fn is held down. I got my own asusg53sx and have spent hours working on it, including google, and have found no help. Do any of you know how to make the function keys default to volume/etc. rather than the useless ass f1-f11? When I did it for my friend it was simple as hell, I just can&#39;t remember how.</description>

            <p>you might have managed to get into control panel -&gt; region and language and changed the layout? Or maybe some ASUS tool that only comes preinstalled, have you done a format on it(some things are not uploaded to the driver page)?</p>

            <p>Yes, I will try that, but when I did it for my friend it was simple as hell, I’d rather just use the simple ass hell strategy that worked last time. I just searched something in the start<br>
menu’s search bar and changed a setting and that was it.</p>

            <p>try the bios. there should be an option under System Configuration &gt; Function Key Behavior or something similar.</p>
