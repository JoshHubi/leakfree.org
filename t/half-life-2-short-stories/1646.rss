    <title>Half-life 2: Short Stories</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-2-short-stories/1646</link>
    <description>&quot;Half-life 2: Short Stories encompasses two, separate modifications: Paradigm Decay and A Human Error. Both projects are episodic based, with an arc anticipated to span three episodes each. This short collection is based entirely in the Half-life universe, and you&#39;ll be engaging in new kinds of gameplay throughout. The main goal behind these projects however is simply to release; short, contained and polished pieces of gameplay that aren&#39;t stuck in limbo or mod development for two plus years only to never see the light of day.

Paradigm Decay
For humanity, time stands still; a gradual decay under the Combine&#39;s relentless consumption of its people, technology and planet. The world lies dormant; its secrets lost to the ages, forgotten and free from exploit and plundering. Now, out in the distant Siberian wastes, men of science have uncovered an expanse of land long liberated from tampering, and have begun to unearth its mysteries... mysteries that lead into the most secluded, darkest regions of space... Paradigm Decay is comprised of three short Episodes that are each told from entirely different perspectives, each contributing to the overall arc in its own. Through these characters unravel a web of lies and manipulation.

Human Error
Some chose to resist, others chose to collaborate; to yield to the Combine and enforce their rule and will. One such body is the Civil Protection unit, an arm of the Overwatch that maintains order in the Cities. In Human Error, become part of a small Civil Protection team that is pitted against the remains of the Xenian forces, who are making a last ditch effort to escape Earth. Utilize a variety of new tools such as controllable manhacks, and use new vehicles such as the APC.&quot;
