Physics in games arent perfect - those barrells shouldve fallen down when stepped on them. Anyway - this allows you to miss some fire exchange with army boys.

I was actually looking for a way to attack them from behind. Problem is - spawning happens when you go the &quot;proper&quot; way - this means I found only 3 guys and then, soldiers &quot;magically&quot; appeared in empty before rooms.</description>

<p>I was actually looking for a way to attack them from behind. Problem is - spawning happens when you go the “proper” way - this means I found only 3 guys and then, soldiers “magically” appeared in empty before rooms.</p>
