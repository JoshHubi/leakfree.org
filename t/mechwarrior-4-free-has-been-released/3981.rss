        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was able to successfully install it and patch it using MTX yesterday.  I had to download the files twice though, because the first time the install failed and the packages wouldn’t manually install.  The second time I set it to install I came back about 1.5 hours later and it was installed and running fine.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Lame.  I never heard they were only releasing Mercs!  When they originally made the announcements they said Mechwarrior 4 would be released for free and all of it’s expansions.  NOT just one of the expansions.  I am disappoint.  :’(</p>
<p>Miss me some vengeance!</p>
