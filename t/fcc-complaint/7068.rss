    <title>FCC Complaint?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fcc-complaint/7068</link>
    <description>So this is a little odd thread but earlier today I received a call from my ISP/Cable provider stating that they wanted to talk in regards to an FCC complaint. Hypothetically, if I were to have obtained some media in *unconventional* ways, do you think it could refer to that? I haven&#39;t heard of the FCC logging complaints against specific consumers to their ISPs. Just curious as to what you think it could be about, I won&#39;t find out until tomorrow when their offices open again.</description>

            <p>Where I live we have received two. And it’s just a seize and desist type of warning. I don’t <em>think</em> you have anything to worry about since nothing became of our two notices.</p>
<p>Our internet provider warned us by blocking any web access by placing a warning page up stating why. And we had to call to confirm we received the notice to unblock access.</p>

</aside>
<p>Now that is effective recycling. Well anyways after a 30 minute discussion with the phone company discussing a complaint I evidently submitted to the FCC about their service it turned out they had copied the wrong information from their forms and the call was meant for someone else. Way to go. <em>slow clap</em></p>
<p>But thanks for all the input regardless, I was getting a little nervous for a while there.</p>

            <p>It could just be internet traffic in general. A similar thing once happened to a friend of mine, but they never said anything about the FCC. He used to be constantly downloading one thing or another, so much in fact, that the activity light on his modem never flashed…it was on solid all the time. His ISP called one day and told him that they didn’t know what he was downloading, but that they could see constant download ques to ISPs that are common for share programs. He seriously cut down, and they didn’t turn him off…and that’s all I know.</p>

            <p>The FCC is more concerned with RFI (radio frequency interference) than piracy. You didn’t modify any of your electronics to tick off neighbors, did you?   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>They didn’t expressly state that the complaint was about me they just said “an FCC complaint.” I haven’t been able to find any precedents for the FCC contacting the ISPs of specific users to lodge a complaint. Most contacts seem to be done through the production houses of the material.</p>

</aside>
<p>The fact that the FCC is <span class="bbcode-i">asking you</span> to contact them means they don’t know <span class="bbcode-i">who</span> you are and likely only have your IP address.  It’s very likely the FCC has asked your provider for your contact details, a request that your provider would (or should) deny without a court order.</p>
<p>So the FCC asked if your ISP could relay the request for you to contact <span class="bbcode-i">them</span> instead.  Which means the last thing you want to do is contact the FCC, revealing your identity.</p>

<p>Well, I also haven’t “gotten anything new” recently, and I haven’t received a copyright infringement notice which they usually send. I feel as though if it were referring to legal action it would be in the form of a letter, rather than a rather polite call from the cable company.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know when I got contacted for piracy, it was through a letter from my ISP that included a letter from Universal and one from the FBI. Nothing from the FCC.</p>
<p>Though, this was a few years ago, so they may do things differently now.</p>
<p>Did they say it was a complaint against you?</p>
