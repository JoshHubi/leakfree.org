    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/would-you-guys-be-interested-in-a-pokemon-red-blue-remake-in-source/4298</link>
    <description>I am thinking of starting up a mod to recreate the classic Pokémon games in source, 3d and everything like that, I was just curious if it would be worth my time. SO would any of you be interested in playing something like this?</description>

</aside>
<p>Fixed that for you.</p>
<p>Pokémon games typically DO get a lot of additions between games, except that’s the problem.  You can only add another 100 pokémon so many times before it just loses its meaning and/or you’re just adding useless fluff, and can only add so many game elements before the thing’s only enjoyable to the spergiest of sperglords who keep excel tables of everything.  That’s why I generally don’t like Pokémon beyond the original R/B/Y.  I’ve lately been trying to make myself play Gold/Silver again, but I’m just not really feeling the urge.</p>

<p>Something always reminds me of this game, be it a picture, video or a text. Or could it be that I still have to wait 10 more days for it to be released <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>I know people who are seventeen, sixteen, and fifteen-years-old and they still play games like Super Mario Galaxy 2 or Pokémon HeartGold Version.</p>
<p>And before anyone asks, yes, they <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> play games like Left 4 Dead 2, God of War 3, or BioShock 2. :hmph:</p>
<p>EDIT: ‘Tis a shame, Left 4 Dead 2 is the only Valve game they know about. :’(</p>

<p>“Pussy out?” So basically you are saying that by playing on easy I’m not playing it completely? I’m just used to the gameplay of others games, considering how most of the FPS games I play have iron sights, so I suck against the combine and the millitary because I suck at aiming. I suck at the game, but that doesn’t mean I don’t feel I’m geting a good/full experience of the game.</p>
<p>Wait… I’m losing masculinity by playing on easy? :[</p>
