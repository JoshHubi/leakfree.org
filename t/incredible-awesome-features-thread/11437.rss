    <description>So Mont Blanc talked about an incredibly awesome features thread on the incredible minor gripe thread and I decided to make it  :smiley: .


One feature I really loved was in the start, when the guard commented on that you cut your ponytail.</description>

<p>You know how in CSS, or Gmod, when you die, your model goes ragdoll and you see it in third-person fall to the floor, roll down an incline, etc? That’s pretty much it, just in first-person perspective.</p>
<p>As for me, I really loved the gibbing, as well as the elevator crash in UC, QE’s revamp, and the Garg’s increased scariness in Power up.</p>

            <p>I recall the first time I got killed, which was all the way out on the cliffs in Surface Tension. The fact that your body pseudo-‘ragdolls’ upon death had me bug-eyed and laughing when my corpse went rolling into the canyon.</p>

            <p>Upon getting to the lambda core coolant pumps//reactors, I patiently sat with my glueon gun out and absorbed the science.</p>
<p>The level of detail and authenticity put into that last chapter (for now) is biblical.<br>
Fuck, ALL of it’s biblical. I’ve got serious faith that they’ll make Xen just as good as the rest. Best of luck guys.</p>

<p>Really? I didn’t notice that at all…?</p>
<p>The stuff I liked have mostly been mentioned, but I gotta add this: The changes to the big room where you jump across the bottomless black chasm in HL1 were very welcome in the biggest way. Now there’s an actual bottom to that place, and it looks like it has purpose. I was a little worried about that, to be honest.</p>

            <p>The Lambda Core teleporter. A majore improvement in design from the original, pretty much the same level of quality of the resonance cascade test chamber. In HL1 it looked a bit meh.<br>
Half-life games were always about getting to a ceirtain place against all odds. You get there - you’re given tremendous payoff (i.e. Black Mesa East, Nova Prospect, The Citadel, White Forest). In HL1 you get 2 major goals - the Lambda Core and Nihilanth. While Nihilanth and the ending were pretty good, the Core on the other hand… not so much.</p>

<p>I also really, really love the gargantua. It may not be as bulky as the original, but it’s just as terrifying, maybe even more so. That big glowing eye it has is just awesome. And its death scene was really satisfying.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually, garg’s sounds in HL were much more terrifying for me. Now they sound like a roaring dragon or some other mythical lizard.</p>

            <p>QE is a hell of a lot more interesting now. I read all of the analysis in the whiteboards and found it a great detail. I looked like an actual biology (xenology?) laboratory.<br>
The Lambda Reactor was so pretty I didn’t mind getting lost in it. I just calmed myself with the soothing blue shading.</p>

            <p>MAJOR: The Fighter Jets on the ST Cliff make a bombing run on the Dam in the distance, and when it explodes, you see the intense light from the explosion, and the sound wave that quickly travels to your direction. Then:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">[color=Red]BOOM![/SIZE]</span></span></span></p>
<p>That particular part made my day.</p>
<hr>
<p>Not only did the mod team give QE a MAJOR facelift, gave it more backstory, and captured the feel of a secret lab, they ALSO made it much more ambient, giving the first part of this chapter a distinct horror vibe to it.</p>
<p>You can hear the distant gunshots, the horrific, agonizing screams of the Scientists getting slaughtered by the HECU in cold blood, and when you travel further into the labs, you can actually see these dead Scientist in the labs, as well as HECU squads in the vicinity of these dead Scientists, further strengthening the HECU’s job and relationship to silencing everyone in the facility who has an affiliation to this accident.</p>

            <p>I agree with almost every awesome thing stated so far.<br>
As for my own thing, I thought it was pretty awesome for the tram to have a dead man’s switch (failsafe).  Hell, I missed that there was a checkbox in the options for it until after OAR, lol…  That was one thing that pissed me off about HL - you’d be cookin’ along and BAM, you jump off/fall off/get knocked of the tram and it just leaves you in the dust.</p>

            <p>My favorite is in Anomalous Materials when you destroy the casserole - the guard tells you to “make like an atom and split.”  If you keep talking to the guard he goes on:</p>
<p>“You better make like a baby and head out”<br>
“You better make like traffic and jam”<br>
etc for like 10 lines.</p>

<p>The recreation of Half-Life 1, that’s a cool feature. (Not even kidding)</p>

<p>Agreed. I feel like this mod’s very existence is basically a miracle. I mean, it’s a total recreation of one of the greatest shooters ever made… developed by a small team of unpaid modders over the course of 8 years. And instead of dying or falling prey to its own ambition, they basically pulled it off. How did the universe allow such a thing to happen?</p>
<p>Also, another awesome feature is the lighting in On A Rail. It really adds to the atmosphere, and it makes me wish that chapter was longer.</p>

<p>Yeah. The attention to detail with the computer-calculated physics sequences are truly nominal.</p>

            <p>The Rocket Lift puzzle was a great addition to On A Rail.  Also, until the part where areas were skipped, Surface Tension was more memorable than in the original Half-Life.</p>

            <p>UC in general was really wicked, felt really cool going through those dark hallways full of zombies. Really awesome.</p>
<p>One of my favorite moments was at the Rocket Launch, that was really awesome and satisfying (Not to mention I loved OAR in general, while I hated it in Half life, I actually wish it was a bit longer in BM)</p>

            <p>I love the “random” dialouge between npcs. How if you have “X” npc in your party and you reach “X” moment, the npcs will have new dialouge, like if you have that security guard with you when you reach the big ammo room in Surface Tension, the two guads chat, but if you go alone the guard just talks to you.</p>

<p>If the BM tentacles actually made something that can be called noise when they smash the platforms in the silo, it would have edged them over the HL1 ones for me.</p>
