    <title>Half-Life Soundtrack (But this one is different! ...slightly)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-soundtrack-but-this-one-is-different-slightly/12036</link>
    <description>([u]I&#39;m not sure if this is the right section for this so let me know if it needs to be moved[/u])


I got bored and decided to try something today.
People have tried to get the Half-Life 1 soundtrack into Black Mesa but they can&#39;t really do a good job of it because the timing is all wrong due to where the tracks play; plus, tracks don&#39;t even play in some of the maps where they did in Half-Life.  I modified the necessary maps and files so that most of the tracks from Half-Life play in the proper maps when they&#39;re supposed to.
This means that yes, Drums and Riffs now plays when you launch the rocket in OaR like it&#39;s supposed to; for the people that are so obsessive about that.

So if you&#39;re feeling nostalgic you might consider using this.

I&#39;ve also kept some of the tracks from the Black Mesa soundtrack that (I thought atleast) fit really well in the mod, but changed the placement for a couple of tracks so they fit better.
If you don&#39;t want any tracks from the BM soundtrack to remain though you can just delete the files from the music folder.



Here&#39;s the link: (It&#39;s large because these Half-Life 1 tracks are high quality ones)
[url]https://www.gamefront.com/files/22893148/Black_Mesa___Modified_Soundtrack_1_1_rar[/url]
[url]https://depositfiles.com/files/7pd5b2p6p[/url] (alternative link for people who have problems using gamefront for whatever reason. Not the best alternative but this was the only other site I found that allows files as large as this)

Also, while I did make a backup for the original soundtrack incase you want to uninstall this, [b]I forgot to backup my maps before doing this so you&#39;ll have to backup your maps folder yourself[/b]. (sorry :fffuuu :slight_smile: 
This also works with Surface Tension Uncut, but i&#39;ll probably have to make some changes when On a Rail uncut is released.

And I am aware that the whole Half-Life soundtrack thing has been done to death. 
But this is the first time, to my knowledge, that the maps have been successfully modified so that the tracks actually play in the maps they&#39;re supposed to, when they&#39;re supposed to.</description>

<p>Gamefront sucks ! I can’t download. Make other download source like mediafire. It’s the best.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ll try to get another link up.<br>
The reason why I didn’t use mediafire is because you’re limited to 200mb uploads for a free account.</p>
<p>The file is larger both because I included the original soundtrack as a backup and  the Half-Life 1 tracks are high quality ones.</p>
