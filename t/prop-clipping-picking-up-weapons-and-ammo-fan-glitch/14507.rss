    <title>Prop clipping | picking up weapons and ammo | fan glitch</title>

    <description>Having played the original release, I&#39;m now on my first play through of the Steam version.  Up to Office Complex.  Findings so far:

1) There have been several situations where I am unable to pick up (with the &quot;use&quot; key) ammo crates and weapons.  Even if I have already done so (e.g. I just picked it up, threw it 10 feet, and went to pick it up again - can no longer pick it up).  This is not linked to any particular area.  The last time it happened was the .357 in the locked office near the freezer (map     : bm_c1a2c at: -18 x, 1151 y, 280 z).  It makes the &quot;positive&quot; sound effect but that&#39;s it.

2) When you turn off the fan in the optional ducts in Office Complex (map     : bm_c1a2c at: 883 x, 1519 y, 362 z), then flip the switch back on, the wind turns back on but the fan does not.

3) If you crouch on a bullsquid, you clip straight through it.  map     : bm_c1a2c at: -2177 x, 124 y, 216 z.  Though there have been many other clipping issues - guards&#39; guns going through walls when they&#39;re standing close; scientists crossing their arms and forearms essentially disappear.

3a) I searched for &quot;crowbar gib&quot; and found nothing but..... you can&#39;t gib models with the crowbar.  Can only the explosive damage type do this now?  If so.... disappointing  :-/

<p>There have been several situations where I am unable to pick up (with the “use” key) ammo crates and weapons.  Even if I have already done so (e.g. I just picked it up, threw it 10 feet, and went to pick it up again - can no longer pick it up).  This is not linked to any particular area.  The last time it happened was the .357 in the locked office near the freezer (map     : bm_c1a2c at: -18 x, 1151 y, 280 z).  It makes the “positive” sound effect but that’s it.</p>
