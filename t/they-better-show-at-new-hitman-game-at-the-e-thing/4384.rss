            <p>Nope, the old “Tenchu” is the jap version of hitman, and it was a great game, way more entertaining than the lonely bald</p>

            <p>Yeah, if Japanese Game designers ever touched Hitman, it would become<br>
“Yuffie Kisaragi: The Game” (Note: Yuffie Kisaragi was the Materia thief/ Part-time Ninja in Final Fantasy VII who would become a part of the Travelling party if given the right choice and Random encounter.)</p>

</aside>
<p>Square Enix bought Eidos, so don’t worry that Hitman won’t probably get touched by Japanese game designers.</p>
<p>It would own if Rocksteady made a Hitman game tho, but they’re busy with Arkham Asylum 2 and that’s a good thing.</p>

<p>Doesn’t afraid of Mardi Gras indeed!<br>
I never played the hitman game, but I have seen the movie.<br>
I’m guessing it’s not an accurate representation.</p>
