    <title>Can&#39;t install Gmod weapon swep...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-install-gmod-weapon-swep/1757</link>
    <description>I just installed Gmod 10 today and I can install simple maps and mods, but there&#39;s one Halo weapons swep mod that I can&#39;t for the life of me install.
[url]https://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&amp;id=82550[/url]
I tried putting the entire folder in the addons folder, I tried putting each folder in their respective folder in garrysmod/garrysmod but to no avail. The readme is completely illegible, it&#39;s like it was written by someone on acid.

Could anyone please tell me how to get this thing working?

Thanks  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>I’m sure it’s not a fake, everything seems to be there, but the readme definitely looks like it was written by a 12-year old on acid.</p>

            <p>No, but I just installed Gmod today so I don’t think there could be much wrong with it. Could someone perhaps download the mod in question (it’s not even 5 MB) and take a look at it? I’m almost certain that there’s something with the file structure, it seems to be too many directories down.</p>

            <p>Have you tried cleaning your garrysmod folder, then trying to copy the folder? That usually does the trick for me.</p>
