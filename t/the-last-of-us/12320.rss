            <p>Well, it <span class="bbcode-i">was</span> very good. And this is coming from someone who neither plays third person games nor games on playstation.</p>
<p>But getting pissed because a reviewer has a differing opinion or found a couple of flaws is just silly. In fact, the second should be commended, because it’s quite hard. I only found, like, one noticeable thing in the first 3rd of the game. (All I got to play through)</p>
<p>Them melee weapons. Brittle as glass.</p>

            <p>The fans are really throwing me off. The kind who constantly scream like little children when the game is given anything less than a 10/10. I mean, such people are with all games, but it’s just hard to ignore them here since there’re even more than usual.</p>

            <p>Well, you can always buy a ps3 for the new Metal Gear collection too. I’m really thinking about it, because i really want to play Last of Us… I thought the scores for Infinite seemed a bit over the top, but i changed my mind as soon as i played that game.</p>

            <p>I like never play with others xD unless I’m at their place. I used to be PC IS MASTERRACE as well, but then it got outa date, and I didn’t feel like updating. Then we got a xbox360 and it’s been fun. A games a game really, the only bummer with consoles is that it’s pretty set in graphics.</p>

            <p>I rented TLOU from redbox for about 2 days and I fucking loved it. The story was amazing, albeit somewhat predictable. The characters seemed realistic enough to the point where the player connects with them. The gameplay had enough action and stealth that made me regret every shot I missed.</p>
<p>I haven’t played its multiplayer due to the limited time I had with it, but I watched some videos of it on youtube. One of the gamemodes is similar to TDM and each player has the ability to listen like Joel and see other players when they move. Once killed, you cannot respawn until the next round. In my opinion, it only looks fun if you have buds to play with.</p>

            <p>I could live with either, as long as it’s not too far in the future. Guess I’ll just get a PS3 for now, eventually. I heard its beyond fantastic, but I haven’t looked into it. I want to experience it fully.</p>

            <p>No direct backwards compatibility with any previous Playstation, sadly. Buuuuuuut it might get a re-release at some point or even just accessible through streaming. Just conjecture at this point, really.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem as above, I just can’t afford to get a PS3 right now. But when I can, this is one of the first things I’m getting for it. Unless the PS4 is backwards compatible, in which case I will get that and this game. Has it been confirmed whether it is or not?</p>

            <p>I don’t understand why someone wouldn’t want to own a console. Just like a PC, the benefits justify the price most of the time.</p>

<p>Yeah, not going to happen. This is a Sony game, they own everything in it, even the dev team is a Sony subsidiary.</p>

            <p>Watched the whole playthrough. I’ve seen more moving games, IMHO… But I can’t say anything’s bad about it from watching.</p>
<p>Maybe just the part about the whole zombie apocalypse thing getting old. Then again, breathing can get old in the same way.</p>
<p>They should consider making a PC version later, I’m pretty sure they would attract even more customers.</p>
<p>Also, about Zing’s score… My country has always been… say… special.</p>

            <p>I don’t not play consoles because of some sort of principle or stupid PCMASTERRACE-inspired reasons. I just have better things to spend my money on than a ps3.</p>
