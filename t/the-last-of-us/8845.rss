            <p>Ah good times. I killed my 64 analog sticks by playing Perfect Dark way too much. Well, I played the N64 a whole lot, so it was inevitable for that stiff stick to wear down pretty quickly.</p>

            <p>Hah. GoldenEye pretty much destroyed my C-Buttons and Analogue sticks on two of mine, and MK64 was responsible for one of the R buttons being permanently jammed down.</p>

            <p>I only ever had two N64 controllers, but from Mario Kart 64 alone, we killed those analog sticks pretty effectively.  They were fine if you wanted to push them down, but the upper half of their range was pretty much useless.</p>

            <p>I hate how quickly the 360 controllers degrade.  Every controller I’ve used so far has had the right stick get loose enough to default slightly up and to the right, outside of the normal deadzone, and significantly worn the rubber of the grips.  None of my PS1/2/3 controllers have ever had that problem, and neither have my two GameCube controllers.  N64, on the other hand, it was all too easy to completely kill those analog sticks.</p>
<p>I’d gladly spend an extra $15-20 on a controller I knew would last longer than the system’s life cycle.</p>

            <p>Yeah. I don’t own a PS3. I’m not really privy to Sony’s analog sticks. I just tolerate them for the occasional PSone and PS2 title.</p>
<p>I got a 360 at a good deal with two controllers and a game. Plus it had some sweet artwork on it. It was the Modern Warfare 2 Super Elite Bundle.</p>
<p>Side Note: Microsoft’s analog sticks are pretty crappy too, as they have a tendency to wear down fast with extended play. I’ve only ever been truly satisfied with Nintendo’s Gamecube sticks. Those didn’t break down on me for at least seven years before I had to replace my primary controller. The one side wore down because I was playing Sonic the Hedgehog and MegaMan (read “2D sidescrollers”) so much.</p>

            <p>I love how everyone here owns an Xbox 360 over a PS3 or neither.</p>
<p>Either way, the AI is what makes this perfect for me as I believe that’s what their primary focus is on during gamedev, hence it’s not really Uncharted so much since most of the enemies in Uncharted were just typical ‘occasionally pop out of cover’ type enemies. These, according to ND, act as close to real people as possible.</p>

            <p>^k, so I confused it with another.</p>
<p>So, the majority of what happened in the gameplay video was, in fact, unscripted.</p>
<p>Here, you can read an alternative way:</p>

<p>Well, the developer’s said there was an epidemic from a fungal infection that spread throughout the population. They said it was a reason to have a realistic creation of their zombies. Inspired by “Planet Earth” oddly enough.</p>
<p>So yes, there will be zombies.</p>

            <p>Awesome. I seriously wonder how much of that was scripted. They voiced out a lot of it out so it can’t just be a fluke. However it could just be a reoccurring animation/voice kind of thing. I don’t know, it was awesome non the less.</p>

<p>Are you sure about that? Didn’t the original reveal for this game some months ago show some kind of mutant, zombie style enemies? Has that stuff been cut from the game?</p>

<p>Maybe I’m confusing this game with another.</p>

            <p>It’s really just a case of not needing to reinvent the wheel, I mean, just how many times can you perfect certain mechanics?</p>

<p>I could get into more specifics, but the main point is that they clearly didn’t do much to change any of the game mechanics from the Uncharted series – which might just be because they’re first in class, but still. Even the grenade and cover snapping are straight up carried over.</p>
<p>Like I said, a small gripe. It’s Naughty Dog, so I will be buying it regardless. I just hoped for something a little fresher.</p>

<p>I was wondering why they didn’t show any zombies in the footage. Guess the early reports were wrong.</p>
<p>And yes, I know Naughty Dog is developing it. It’s just a little disappointing that everything they showed looked exactly like a grimmed up version of their last series.</p>

            <p>Now that’s post-apocalypse done right.</p>
<p>I wonder how much of that was scripted, though.</p>
<p>Love how smart the enemies are, though.</p>
