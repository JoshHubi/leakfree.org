    <title>Upgrading Graphics</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/upgrading-graphics/1204</link>
    <description>Now before anyone thinks this is a stupid question, I am quite new to PC gaming and I have done some research on the internet. I have found nothing that answers my questions specifically.

Recently I have been considering upgrading my PC&#39;s graphic card, I just want to know a few things.

Will buying a new graphics card increase framerates in games(even if I dont upgrade the rest of my PC)?

Will any graphics card work in my computer?

I have a Dell, which I&#39;ve heard can cause problems with upgrades, is this true?

Can you reccomend any graphics cards?(I can give my specs if requested)</description>

            <p>Well first of all you have to check if your motherboard has a PCI-E x16 slot and then make sure your dell power supply is enough to power a high-end card.</p>
<p>If your dell has an AGP slot you’ll have to look for AGP cards and I suggest looking for the newest solution from AMD since they made AGP cards newer than nvidia.</p>
<p>In any case, a new graphics card will almost definitely increase your framerate in 3D games, but don’t expect miracles like GTA4 or Crysis.</p>
