    <description>Well, I can&#39;t think of any good game releases coming up (BM does not count) this year, so why not. State your GOTY. Only state your GOTY. Don&#39;t flame other people&#39;s GOTY. (Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if that worked).

Anyways, here&#39;s [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS8H3sIsXnc]mine.[/url] Best game ever.

Seriously though, I&#39;d go with L4D2. Scavenge mode is awesome.</description>

<p>Good point, well thought out. On the other hand L4D2 was quite good and has dedicated servers, so that’s where I’m forced to place my vote.</p>

<p>MW2 and ODST are the only games from this year that I’ve bought, and evidently, they’re too overrated to count as games.</p>

            <p>Tales of Monkey Island</p>
<p>Partially because I can’t think of any others right now besides L4D2 and I don’t want to pick it when I bought L4D in January of this year, overpowering L4D2’s chance.</p>
<p>Partially because of how long we had to wait for the 5th Monkey Island game and the sheer awesomeness of the fact that it was indeed released makes it memorable.</p>
<p>Mostly, though, because it was very good and I haven’t gotten to play a puzzle/adventure game like that in awhile besides “Myst” which isn’t the same type of thing.</p>
<p><em>checks through list of games</em></p>
<p>Huh, seems I spent most of the year catching up on 2008 games I hadn’t gotten to beating and going all out Retro. That and Crysis+WoW ate up some time. Prototype is on my list of good 2009 games, but I’m hard pressed to keep going…</p>

            <p>Well, I can’t think of any good game releases coming up (BM does not count) this year, so why not. State your GOTY. Only state your GOTY. Don’t flame other people’s GOTY. (Wouldn’t it be nice if that worked).</p>
<p>Anyways, here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS8H3sIsXnc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">mine.</a> Best game ever.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I’d go with L4D2. Scavenge mode is awesome.</p>
