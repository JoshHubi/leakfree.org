    <title>Shotgun has issues with shadows</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shotgun-has-issues-with-shadows/9834</link>
    <description>The pump-action shotgun doesn&#39;t shade properly, and this is true everywhere in the game since obtaining it. I have a picture to show you, but Photobucket is being difficult and I can&#39;t upload it. Please forgive my attempt to try and explain the problem, instead.

Whenever I stand away from any direct source of light, the shotgun seems to take on a sort of light shadow of its own. This shadow, however, only starts on the right side of the shotgun, right where a 4x3 screen ratio would end on my 16x9 monitor. It looks like the shotgun is only being illuminated in a 4x3 section of my screen jammed to the far left, with the rest of it not being illuminated at all beyond basic ambient light.

I should note that this doesn&#39;t happen if I walk next to a bright light, such as walking near my flashlight spot. This also doesn&#39;t happen to any of the other weapons that I&#39;ve seen so far, but I have yet to acquire the Tau Cannon, the Gluon Gun or the alien bug arm thing.

I say this may be a screen ratio thing because I&#39;ve seen it happen in other games. City of Heroes went from a 4x3 character editor to a widescreen one, and the bright/dark filter on the background would only cover 3/4 of the screen.

*edit*
Oh, dear... So, posting : 3 turns into a cat&#39;s mouth smilie? OK, then I need to swap my ratios from #:# to #x#</description>

<p>I think I know why I don’t see it on other weapons - the Shotgun is the only one (that I have so far) which extends all the way to the right. Gordon holds his poistols and his crowbar and grenades sort of right of centre, but the gun itself stops before “the line” starts. I’m thinking most of the original weapons were designed to be held just at the edge of the screen in 4x3, which puts them ahead of “the line,” but the shotgun is so large it would normally extend far off-screen, which is why it suffers from this.</p>

<p>Yep. Havin the saem problem. I am running my monitor at 1920*1080 (and ratio is set to16:9 which is the correct ratio for my resolution. It also was the only way to have that resolution show up from the beginning)</p>
<p>But it is also the Magnum (and maybe oter weapons), not only the Shotgun. Maybe also other weapons.</p>
