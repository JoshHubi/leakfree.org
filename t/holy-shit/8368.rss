Actually had a couple of classes with this girl my last year of high school, had no idea she was homeless, or smart like that.</description>

That’s a pretty tenuous link between myself and her.</p>

            <p>Which brings us onto another question; would you screw a homeless girl?</p>
<p>I once saw some homeless fucking in the alley behind where I worked.  I was going to put some cardboard boxes out, opened the fire escape and saw three hobos fucking.  Two guys and a woman.<br>
I quickly went back inside as not to disturb them.  My manager happened to be passing, so I told him and he then spent the rest of the night peeping through the door and watching them.</p>

            <p>It’s funny, even though that portion of the school is like that, it’s a relatively small portion.</p>
<p>In fact, more then half of it is barely a step above the ghetto stuff you hear about all the time (the students, most of the teachers were pretty good).</p>

<p>I went to high school in Boise, Idaho. It was right next to two huge, predominately Mormon neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I have no problem with Mormons in general. Some of them were definitely stuffy and sententious and some of them were cool. I guess some of them actually were bubbly caricatures, but those were few and far between.</p>

            <p>First of all, major props to that chick for dealing with such a shitty situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, since when are high school kids so eerily clean and chipper? (not the girl, but the classmate in the interview). It’s like they stepped right out of an episode of Reading Rainbow. There was no one like that at my high school, and it was half Mormon for fuck’s sake.</p>
