    <description>Personally, do you know what game i think needs a sequel, [b]Jet Set Radio Future[/b], it had good graphics, good gameplay, and awesome music (J-Pop fans anyone), that game was released back in 2002, and i think it&#39;s about time for a new Jet Set Radio game.

What other game do [b]you[/b] think needs a sequel?</description>

<p>I want the original sequel to HL 2. Since it got hacked before it came out, it’s been changed and a lot of parts were missing in the game. Episode 1 and 2 along with 3 were basically in it already. and Raven home was a lot darker and scarier looking plus longer and when Valve was talking about the combine sucking up all the water in the world, they meant it. I mean all the water was literally dried up. Here in the original, HL 2 don’t seemed to have lost much water. Only a little dried but still a lot of water.</p>

<p>Okay, this one is going to sound weird, but I want a sequel to the original Donkey Kong.  Before Bowser kidnapped Mario’s girl, a barrel-throwing ape kept her hostage.  Since Donkey Kong, there hasn’t been a Mario-Kong game where Mario is the protagonist and DK is the antagonist.  In fact, since the original Donkey Kong, the ape was a good guy (even in the actual DK sequel “Donkey Kong Jr”).  I want to see him as the villain once again.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of game it should be, but a sequel to the premise of the original Donkey Kong would be awesome…at least, to me.</p>

            <p>Jet Force Gemini. Its control scheme, with some tweaks, would actually be a perfect combination of platformer any-direction movement. Then, just have one button to switch to an FPS mode. In the original, it put the camera directly behind you, changed your controls to a strafing-mode, and faded your character to 1% opacity. Plus, it automatically set to that for boss fights.</p>

            <p>My most wanted sequels at the moment are Half-Life 2: Episode 3, Portal 2 and sequels to both Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age. Although I would also love a sequel to Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy, a new addition to the Legacy of Kain series, Devil May Cry 5 and Resident Evil 6.<br>
Also I would like a new Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and another old fashioned Splinter Cell, however I currently hate Ubisoft for their lack of care for PC gamers and am not currently buying any of their games.</p>
