    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/3d-monitor-software-is-free/1463</link>
    <description>Don&#39;t know if this is gonna be old news for everyone else but I just found out that you can play games in 3d without having to pay for a 400 dollar special monitor.

[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mudweYKciog&#39;]How to play games in 3d[/url]

I installed it and it gives me red and blue in all my new games like Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Dead Space, Call of Duty World at War and more. My 3d glasses are still coming in the mail though so I won&#39;t be able to tell how well the effect works until they get here.</description>

            <p>The list of 3D technologies is not quite correct…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Lensed</span> - such that both fields are visible on the one screen, side by side or over/under and each eye’s view is bent to a different angle to overlap them.  Only works if you hold your head really still and straight.  Not in common use anymore, since about when colour films came in - the oldest of the tech, it predates moving pictures.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Colour separation</span>; e.g. Red/Cyan, Green/Magenta - these are best used on black&amp;white content as attempts at colour inevitably end up with something coloured such that only one eye can see it, destroying the effect.  Fields are displayed together.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Linear polarisation</span> - Requires a similarly polarised source, so cannot be used on an normal monitor.  Has the same requirement to hold your head level, tho moving about a bit otherwise doesn’t break it.  Needs a good refresh rate if it shows each field consecutively with alternating polarisation alignment, but can be projected with both fields overlapping and in sync.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">LCD shutters</span> - Requires expensive glasses and a synchronisation emitter, but is the best available for standard monitors, tho it also is best with a high refresh-rate, as the perceived rate is halved.  Also shows each field consecutively.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Clockwise/anticlockwise polarisation</span> - the latest thing in the theatres, this uses the same concept as linear polarisation, but removes the requirement for keeping your head level.  Shows each field consecutively or together too.  These glasses are identified by the fact that of all the possible arrangements of a 2 sets, only wearing one the correct way round and looking at someone else wearing them the correct way round shows the darkening of alternate eyes - any other way round and it looks clear.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, I was a little “out of it”.<br>
It was a cross between faded and red and blue. It was also quite blurry, even with it correctly configured.</p>

            <p>I played Portal in 3D once at a computer place near where I live. Because it wasn’t built into the game, it didn’t give a very good 3D effect. It looked like think layers spread apart, like sheets of paper floating in the air, each cut into a shape (such as the portal gun, near walls and far walls).<br>
It was weird.</p>

            <p>Red and blue. Because you have to where red and blue glasses.<br>
Like watching those 3D movies… at least the way they used to be.</p>

<p>It lacks color? In what way? Are the colors faded, or black and white, or red and blue?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>The Nvidia drivers also support this without the need for 3rd party software or a 120hz monitor, but it’s nowhere near the greatness of stereoscopic 3D (which is also supported by Nvidia drivers), which has no red-blue-ness.</p>

            <p>Don’t know if this is gonna be old news for everyone else but I just found out that you can play games in 3d without having to pay for a 400 dollar special monitor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mudweYKciog" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">How to play games in 3d</a></p>
<p>I installed it and it gives me red and blue in all my new games like Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Dead Space, Call of Duty World at War and more. My 3d glasses are still coming in the mail though so I won’t be able to tell how well the effect works until they get here.</p>
