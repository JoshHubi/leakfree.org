    <title>CRASH:  Killing the helicopter</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-killing-the-helicopter/10604</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just got the RPG and the helicopter has appeared.  When I kill it, the game crashes.  I&#39;ve tried killing it with the Tau cannon and with the RPG.  The game crashes when I deliver the fatal blow (or at least I assume it&#39;s the killing strike, as it&#39;s smoking/on fire etc, but the game crashes before it actually goes in to crashing mode etc).

I have uploaded all three crash dumps from my &#39;source sdk base 2007&#39; folder to this post.

EDIT:  I repeatedly tried it again and was eventually able to do it.

EDIT 2: I forgot to mention that it also sometimes crashed when I died during the battle (it could be just me, but it seemed it crashed most often if I killed myself with the RPG).

On a related note, when I was directing a fired missile with the RPG, if I moved the red dot over a rock I was crouched right behind, the rocket seemed to appear directly in front of me instantly and spasm around wildly before eventually exploding in what I guess would have been the normal time for it to actually fly from where it was to where I was.

I hope this helps.

            <p>I’ve had two crashes (and the only two so far!) both on this cliff level.<br>
Once when firing a grenade at a soldier. (The game crashed after the grenade impacted)<br>
And the second crash occurred after a missile from the rpg hit the helicopter.<br>
Apart from this the game has run flawlessly so far.</p>
