    <title>Batman:Arkham Origins E3 gameplay walkthrough and interview</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/batman-arkham-origins-e3-gameplay-walkthrough-and-interview/12336</link>
    <description>A pretty lengthy [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FJdfxaQNphc#]walkthrough[/url] that also includes a lot of new info.
As much as it looks like the last one I really like what I am seeing so far.
They are basically adding little details here and there to an already proven formula that worked in the previous games cause why fix something if it aint broken.
The new voice actors Roger Craig Smith(Ezio from AC)is perfectly channeling the younger Conroy and Baker as The Joker never seizes to amaze me with his talent(Booker from Bioshock Infinite,Joel from The Last of Us).
They also brought this new sense of verticality to the game(among the other things)and the fact that Christopher Drake of The Dark Knight Returns and Batman:Under The Red Hood is doing the soundtrack makes everything even better.</description>

            <p>Agree. Especially since I feel like Arkham City was too focused on the interior gameplay that Asylum was built on. I feel like the city segments got shafted and origins seems like it’s gonna focus on them. s’good.</p>

            <p>Even if it’s more of the same, it’ll still be good, so I don’t see why I shouldn’t play this at some point.</p>
<p>Same goes for games like AC or CoD.</p>

            <p>Idk. I really liked City and I really like the arch of the first two years in Batman’s career, so I can’t really see this going too wrong. Plus take into account this is a whole different studio and the negative backlash if they DID do an exponential lateral expansion like that could turn people off of the game totally.</p>
<p>I was sort of skeptical too, but.</p>

<p>This is the interview that won me over.</p>

            <p>Arkham Asylum to Arkham City was a massive improvement. This just looks like more of the same, just slightly different in presentation for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>I was hoping the origin story for the Arkham games would be a version of Batman that actually has <span class="bbcode-i">fewer</span> gadgets and has an emphasis on combat and acrobatics, not overpowered gadgets.</p>
