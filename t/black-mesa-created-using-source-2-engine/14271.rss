    <title>Black Mesa created using source 2 engine?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-created-using-source-2-engine/14271</link>
    <description>Hello guys. Earlier this year valve announced source 2 engine, and that it will be free.

Will Black Mesa be considered to be re-created using source 2 engine?</description>

<p>Calm down. It was just a joke and no need to act like this. Perhaps it will be ported to Source 2 one day, perhaps it never will, perhaps it will get cancelled soon, perhaps it will be picked the game of the year.</p>
<p>We are just talking, but if you don’t want that, thats fine.</p>

<p>There’s no need to play the victim. The phrase <span class="bbcode-i">grasping at straws</span> comes to mind with this particular topic. We welcome discussion about anything BMS related on these forums, but as we’ve pretty decisively shot down the idea of a Source 2 port (on multiple occasions), I don’t really see how there’s any more productive discussion to be had.</p>
<p>Sarcasm and jokes don’t often come across very well over the internet, where tone can’t be adequately conveyed. It certainly didn’t come across as a joke to me, because I’ve seen people make similar logical leaps from sentences like that. I’m not trying to stifle discussion so much as trying to prevent wildfires. I am fine with talking, but have witnessed first hand how a simple discussion like this can very quickly expand into far more than intended, as with the initial Source 2 rumours. I am wary of that.</p>
<p>Feel free to talk about <span class="bbcode-b">anything else.</span></p>

</aside>
<p>“You know nothing Jon Snow!” Err… What I mean is, until the engine gets a proper release we wont know if it would be feasible to port the game or not. Who knows, perhaps even Valve could do it (or rather make a 3rd party do it), since I am pretty sure they will re-release their old games such as Half-Life 2 and it is episodes, along with Team Fortress 2, Counter Strike Global Offensive and Portal 1-2 etc. I am basing this on how they kept porting these games on newer version of the Source engine and how they are already porting Dota 2 as Dota 2 Reborn. Maybe they would make a OrangeBox 2.0 to release it on Next-gen consoles, with all these games and maybe it would include Black Mesa instead of Half-Life Source. Who knows… They even ported the original Half-life to Source engine and that says something.</p>

            <p>Unless a series of extremely unlikely and complicated scenarios all unfold perfectly, and the stars and moon align in perfect harmony, we won’t be porting to Source 2. Porting from Source 2007 --&gt; TF2 was enough to make most of us want to quit forever.</p>

            <p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/1749-Maxey/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@Maxey</a> yes agree. It doesn’t have to be BM on source 2. But it would be nice to see HL1 on source 2 engine. Someone is gonna do it someday … hopefully… lolololz</p>

            <p>Not even necessarily a remake of Black Mesa, just a new HL1 remake on Source 2.</p>

            <p>They’ve already said they didn’t port to the newest branch of Source because it was too different and they had no interest in basically recreating their game. Recreating in an entirely different engine? Yeah, there’s no way. Source BM is fine, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Hello guys. Earlier this year valve announced source 2 engine, and that it will be free.</p>
<p>Will Black Mesa be considered to be re-created using source 2 engine?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the devs stated somewhere that they wouldn’t be porting BM into Source 2 …</p>
<p>(please correct me if I’m wrong)</p>

            <p>I’m not a dev, but I’m gonna take a guess and say no.<br>
It’s probably a shit ton of work that the team doesn’t need right now, there’s stuff to do besides doing a Source 2 port for no reason.</p>
