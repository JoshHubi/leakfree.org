    <description>Hello everyone!

I have a suggestion for Black Mesa (for the multiplayer part):

I read that Black Mesa uses a face creation system for having a wide range of different looking heads for NPCs.

I think it would be great also to take use of this feature for Black Mesa deathmatch and co-op, so that you can choose or lets say &quot;design&quot; your own individual player model.

As in HL1, where you had the option to color the clothes of a player model, you could now have options (list boxes and controllers) where you can select a head, change the facial flexes, select a skin and if wanted, also subobjects.

I think this would be a much better solution, than just having one form of a scientist, guard and soldier.</description>

<p>Just look at TF2. Part of its success is the fact that all the classes have completely different looks and personalities. It is certainly much more fun playing a game with plenty of player customization and differentiation</p>

            <p>While a bit intriguing, I have to wonder if it might be a little out of the scope of the project. I mean that sort of feature that will only be used for the deathmatch portion…Makes me wonder if there will be <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">THAT</span></span> much work done for multiplayer features when the focus is primarily the single player experience.</p>

            <p>Maybe a two button system in the menu that generates a face randomly (and shows it) and another one that saves a perticular configuration? Not too much work in the menues but then again, maybe its more than i think  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Ok, it is a cool idea, but it wont happen.<br>
The facial system randomly applies components to characters (albeit adjusted with environment, as you know sunglasses when outside) so to have a system where you can choose what components and make your own face is a different system entirely.<br>
Thats alot of work. I would think they would just have more options then a customization feature.</p>
