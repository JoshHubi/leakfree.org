    <title>Powering on Exhaust causes crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/powering-on-exhaust-causes-crash/13385</link>
    <description>I used installer to install the game so everything is in the right folders and such. Game didn&#39;t have a single crash until powering on the exhaust to defeat the blind &quot;boss&quot; that smashes based on sound. Works for a few seconds after turning exhaust on and then game crashes as if it is trying to start a sound or animation that isn&#39;t there. Not sure if anyone has ran into this issue yet but as of right now I can&#39;t continue the game until the issue is fixed somehow.</description>
