<p>I heard something about that different group worked on AVP then guys who made Shellshock 2 or Rogue Warrior. Anyway everything looks in a good way (hype or not) I am just keeping my expectations at low level for sure…</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It was yet another Weyland-Yutani Corporation “science colony.”  The fact that there were Colonial Marines everywhere doesn’t necessarily mean that it was a military installation because the USCM are mercenaries paid by Weyland-Yutani to protect their assets in an environment known to be hostile.</p>
<p>The fact that there <span class="bbcode-b">are</span> gun-toting mercenaries everywhere is evidence that, as usual, the Company is up to no good and experimenting with xenomorphs.  That would be why the Alien campaign starts you out as a facehugger whose egg was in a crate that just happened to get knocked over when the pilot failed to secure it properly before being called away.</p>
<p>It was a decent game, with well-balanced multiplayer and a well-written single player story.  Monolith did a really good job of winding the three threads of the story into a coherent whole, which is something Rebellion didn’t really bother with in their second game (their first AvP game was actually “Alien vs Predator” on the Atari Jaguar, and the three single player campaigns were really well done in that one), who chose instead to focus on getting the ambiance right and using it to make a terrifying multiplayer game.  The Lithtech game engine just wasn’t up to the task of creating both the dark, claustrophobic, “shit gonna jump out at you from nowhere” feel for the Alien and Marine campaigns and the dense, muggy, “hopping through the treetops hunting softmeat” feel for the Predator campaign.  The indoor environments for that game were pretty well done, but the outdoor environments just didn’t have the right tone and gameplay feel.</p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to this one, and have been ever since I found out about it a few months ago.  The only real drawback is that I’ll only be able to play it at night after my daughter is asleep, because it’ll be just a little scarier than I’m willing to expose her to.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">   She digs Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and Bioshock, but AvP would give the poor kid nightmares (shit, it gives <span class="bbcode-b">me</span> nightmares!).</p>

<p>maybe a bit off topic, but as a fan of alien and predator i find that only the alien movies 1-3 were good and both predator movies but only the 2nd AvP movie. i hope that the new alien movie will be better than alien 4. the games were always better than some of the movies because rebellion know how to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s pretty much universally agreed that the first AvP movie was a massive disappointment.  I could go on for hours about where they went wrong, but really it boils down to setting.  If you replace every reference to Earth and Antarctica in that movie with the name of yet another alien world that WYC is attempting to colonize, and remove that stupid bit about the Mayans and their pyramids, then the movie would <span class="bbcode-b">work</span>.</p>
<p>But if you’re going to turn those xenomorphs loose on our homeworld…that right there is the scariest shit I can think of.  So you’d better get it right.  One facehugger in a populated region can wreak a lot of havoc, and once those bugs start reproducing or looking for a way to set up a nest for that purpose…</p>
<p>AvP: Requiem got it right.  That movie - especially the unrated version - was scary as shit. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>maybe a bit off topic, but as a fan of alien and predator i find that only the alien movies 1-3 were good and both predator movies but only the 2nd AvP movie. i hope that the new alien movie will be better than alien 4. the games were always better than some of the movies because rebellion know how to do it.</p>

<p>He’s saying that at no point did you play as a facehugger in the '99 game.  I know because I have it and still play it. The Alien campaign started in a sort of Alien temple.</p>
<p>The facehugger and chest burster life cycle was only in AvP2 (which, in my opinion, was the worst of the two… but still decent).</p>
<p>By the way, I will definitely be getting this game.</p>

            <p>Yeah…do want for my birthday.</p>
<p>Along with Black Mesa, of course.  If both BMS and AvP3 come out in time for my birthday, my head will probably explode from trying to decide which one to play first. O.o</p>
<p>Edit: As a die hard AvP fan, I have to issue a correction here:</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You could play as a facehugger in the single player campaign and in multiplayer matches that had “Alien life cycle” turned on <span class="bbcode-b">in Aliens vs. Predator 2</span>.  Not the '99 AvP game.</p>
<p>This one is being developed by the company that did the '99 AvP game (Rebellion), however, so I’m damn happy.  Monolith made an acceptable game in AvP2, but they didn’t quite capture the feel of the series quite as well as Rebellion did.</p>
