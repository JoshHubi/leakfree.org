    <title>December Beta Update: Some of the glitches I&#39;ve found so far</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/december-beta-update-some-of-the-glitches-ive-found-so-far/15326</link>
    <description>Hello. dear devs.
I&#39;ve played the whole game process for several times of the December Beta and I have found some glitches as so far. I don&#39;t know if any of them are actually bugs, but I&#39;ll show them to you guys.

Maybe other people has reported to you already for a few glitches. If so, I feel sorry about doing the same thing. These are not all found in Dec. beta, some of them are old ones.
I will report these glitches by chapters.

My PC system specs:
E3 1231 v3
GTX970
Windows 7 64 bit

Resolution in 1920*1080
All graphic settings are in the highest level.
=======================================

Chapter 1 Black Mesa Inbound
1. I found that only this chapter does not have title, I think you can add a title &quot;Black Mesa Inbound&quot; for it.

=======================================

Chapter II Anomalous Materials
1. Some of the room are too bright, such as the toilet in the area where you get the H.E.V, tone down a little will be better.

=======================================

Chapter III Unforeseen Consequence
1. I find that when Xen portals appears, they don&#39;t illuminate the environment every time, is this a bug or just a setting (Only appear in certain areas)?

=======================================

Chapter IV Office Complex
1.The volume of the broadcast for Black Mesa Emergency is too low, and it is covered by the BGM here. It can be increased a little, I think.

=======================================

Chapter V &quot;We&#39;ve Got Hostiles&quot;
1. The two scientist will block your way if you don&#39;t interact to them. (They will not give way when you get close to them, they&#39;ll stand there instead)
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1277835681[/url]
2. The world model of MP5 is a little rough.

=======================================

Chapter VI Blast Pit
1.Weird lighting here, it&#39;s too dark on the pipe.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275585435[/url]

2. I remembered that in the original HL, this two platforms in the two silos will collapse after you turn on the power, fuel and oxygen. Will this incident be added back?
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275585514[/url]
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275585564[/url]

=======================================

Chapter VII Power Up
1. I remembered that in the original HL, this platform will collapse after you turn on the power. Will this incident be added back?
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275585669[/url]

2.The icon of MP5 ammo and shotgun ammo are not showed on the HUD when you pick up the ammos, so do the following chapters.

=======================================

Chapter VIII On a Rail
1. The train won‘t stop by itself after you leave it when you reloaded the game here, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a bug.

=======================================

Chapter IX Apprehension
1. Players can still pick up assassin&#39;s pistol

=======================================

Chapter X Residue Processing
1. The animation that you first equip the H.E.V suit (check the suit and clean the ash) will play again at the first of this chapter, when you reload the game here.

2. Weird lighting here in the pipe at the first place, I think it&#39;s too dark here while the light is bright. (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a glitch).
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275585719[/url]

3. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s bug but the picture in the monitor here is wrong, this appears after the update.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275585778[/url]

=======================================

Chapter XI Questionable Ethics
1. The shock animation is missing on the body and gibs when you kill enemies by Tau cannon, or is this feature removed temporarily?

=======================================

Chapter XII Surface Tension
1. Weird lighting here when you turn on the flash, it too bright on the water.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275585841[/url]

2. No light here, contrasting with former version I remembered there are 3 light projection on the ground, now only 2. I can&#39;t confirm this is a glitch, maybe you have change the setting.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275586068[/url]

3. Weird reflective material in the pipe here, is this my own problem?
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275585896[/url]

4. Sometimes the turret on the cliff will be missing, reanson is unknown.

5. If you succeeded in saving the scientist that killed by sniper, he will not run away, but return to his previous room and stand at the door, you can&#39;t interact with him. You can&#39;t get into the room because of his blocking the way.

6. Sometimes the explosives and tripmines outside the trap room will missing, the reason is unknown. This problem is very rare and I only met a few times.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275585963[/url]
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275586013[/url]

7. After you killed the Guagantua, a lot of red cross will appear, seems that something is wrong. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my own problem.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275586128[/url]
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275586181[/url]

8. Mortar controller display shows error, the red locator stays in the upper left corner. This happens when you reload the game here.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275586226[/url]

========================================

I haven&#39;t found anything wrong in Chapter XIII &quot;Forget About Freeman!&quot; so far, maybe nothing is wrong.

========================================

Chapter XIV Lambda Core
1. The physical effects of this Vortigaunt&#39;s body is wrong, it&#39;s an old glitch. It will not floating on the water after been killed, but keep twitching and fall onto the ground instead.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275586280[/url]

2. The reactor will automatically overload after a few seconds, no need to use the switch here. Is this a setting that you actually don&#39;t need to turn off the switch and just wait for the overloading or just a bug that this switch didn&#39;t work normally?
It&#39;s an old problem and I show to you again.
[url]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Attachment/5115-20161108224122-1-jpg/[/url]

3. The burning stickers caused by the reactor beams will disappear after you reloaded the game, it&#39;s an old glitch.

4. Only the beam that on the top of the reactor which breaking the exit door has dynamic lighting, others don&#39;t have. Is this a setting?

5 Floating healthkits on the platform in the gaint portal room.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275586344[/url]
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1275586392[/url]

6.This is hard to notice. but I&#39;ve find it.
An instantaneous particle spilling animation disappears from the sudden when the portal to Xen is first formed. But if you reloaded the game here, it runs normally.
You can verify for yourself: Open the console and jump to the map bm_c3a2i, then have a normal play. At that time you will not see the animation. Then reload the autosaved game here and wait till the same incident, then you can see it.
My English is poor and I cannot explain it well. so I make a GIF picture to show to you the difference as below.
[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1276558766[/url]

These are all glitches I found in the gameplay, hope others will show to me if some of them are my own problem. I should confirm these a public issues, not individual ones.

If some one has another suggestions and new reports, welcome to tell me. Hope devs will see this post, I&#39;m very appreciated.

At last, thanks for your whole hard work to Black Mesa. Wish it better and better!
I&#39;ll keep going to find and report more bugs to you in the future.</description>
