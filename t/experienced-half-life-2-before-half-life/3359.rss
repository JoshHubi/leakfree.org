    <title>Experienced Half-Life 2 before Half-Life...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/experienced-half-life-2-before-half-life/3359</link>
    <description>Who here has done it?  I&#39;m sure a lot of people played HL2 before playing HL or HL Source.  Which was the more memorable and satisfying experience? What are your comparisons, thoughts, complaints?  Do you feel the HL game is important to the HL2 story?  You can just answer if you&#39;d like, or continue reading for my thoughts as well...unfortunately I only have the experience of playing HL, countless times (OpFor and BluS as well), while waiting 6 years for HL2.

/slight rant

Finally HL2 arrives and while fun...just didn&#39;t feel like HL, or what I thought a HL sequal should feel like (with regards to story and atmosphere/environments).  Now of course I was by no means expecting, or wanting, the same experience, but I was hoping for a game at least as memorable and impacting.

Now, I can&#39;t offer you my own HL2 story, I&#39;m just not creative like that, but I hate the creation and inclusion of the combine.  I don&#39;t like the direction the story has gone (alien overlords?) and I also do not find the combine as memorable...I feel the HECU were more satisfying to kill, even though they took way too much damage, were a tad weak, and had &quot;dumber&quot; AI.  I also preferred fighting Xen creatures rather than those ant lion creatures (WTF is this starship troopers?).  However, the saving graces of HL2, IMHO, are ravenholm and the HL zombies...they definitely got that right.  I also felt vehicles only made the game feel larger and I honestly didn&#39;t get much pleasure out of operating any of them...other than occasionally running people over.

IMO, Ravenholm helped with environment variability and had the most impact (included puzzles and platforming IIRC).  Something I feel HL was vastly superior with (Anamalous Materials vs. On A Rail vs. Surface Tension vs. Residue Processing vs. Lambda Core vs, Xen etc.).  Other than Ravenholm I was in some European-like city, some coastal location, maybe a mine or a prison and I think that&#39;s about it.  I remember the Citadel...I thought it was kind of bland.

After I finished HL2, I wanted still wanted the HL experience again.  I missed the atmosphere and tension from 6 years earlier.  In HL, it felt like I was racing against the clock to save humanity...not so much in HL2: I feel like if Gordon died, some badass rebel might just take his place. After all, anyone can wear an HEV suit.

Even though I only played HL2 a handful of times and each episode once, I do not think HL2 did HL justice.  I do think HL2 should have been made (I do like the style and art, gameplay is fun) just not called HL2 and not featuring Gordon Freeman and company.

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>For me, it went:</p>
<p>HL2 DM -&gt; Portal: The First Slice -&gt; Orange Box (Played HLs included in order, here.) -&gt; HL1</p>
<p>The first two made me buy The OB, then that got me interested in HL1. I bought Garry’s Mod somewhere in between OB and HL1.</p>

            <p>first off: you can’t compare HL:S to HL1. HL:S suxxxxx*xxx &lt;-&gt; HL1 roxxxxx :&gt;</p>
<p><span class="mention">@topic</span>:<br>
i played hl1 + addons first, and i liked hl2 when it came out…<br>
but when i finished hl2 i was disappointed, because i missed so many things… assassins, gargs, the long jump module, gauss, gluon gun and especially a good multiplayer mode. HL2DM did not feel like HL at all. I was very disappointed.<br>
i think hl2 was a good game, but i think it’s hyped so very much.<br>
hl1 had better ideas, more content (more enemy-types, weapons, environment-layouts) and more variety.</p>
<p>so really… HL1 &gt; HL2. i don’t care about HL2 graphics… HL1 graphic was ok also (YES. old but OK…) …<br>
and HL1 gameplay and ideas were just so very much better.</p>

<p>I played HL2 first.</p>
<p>Originally, I found Garry’s Mod through YouTube, and it looked like the funnest thing I’ve ever seen, so I downloaded it, and eventually when I got steam, I bought it with CSS, TF2 and the HL2 Episode pack.</p>
<p>After a while, I then saw HL2 on YouTube, and loved it, bought the Orange Box for the 360, and then later on, Keresh, the lovely Keresh, gifted me HL2 for the PC, so that whe I get my new PC, I can play it on full settings. I also had Portal bought for me the other day.</p>

<p>SO you’re kinda new…Lol. I think I played half-life 2 first…woah woah wait a minute…I played counter-strike: Condition zero that pwnanated! Then I think I played hl2, then hl1, ep1, ep2…I loved how cool gmod looked so I started playin it back in like '06 or something. RP was a blast! now rp vehicles lag like a bitch and other stuff. :meh::fffuuu:</p>

<p>Sounds to me like Valve could never succeed in your eyes to create a better game than HL, no matter what they did…Perhaps it will be one of those things that you’ll come back to in a year’s time and replay and be blown away.</p>

</aside>
<p>Great post, thanks for the input.  I definitely agree with you to an extent.  One thing that will be interesting will be to compare BM with HL2.  BM appears to successfully update HL and bring it on par with HL2 with regards to graphics, physics, etc.</p>

<p>Who here has done it?  I’m sure a lot of people played HL2 before playing HL or HL Source.  Which was the more memorable and satisfying experience? What are your comparisons, thoughts, complaints?  Do you feel the HL game is important to the HL2 story?  You can just answer if you’d like, or continue reading for my thoughts as well…unfortunately I only have the experience of playing HL, countless times (OpFor and BluS as well), while waiting 6 years for HL2.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like Valve could never succeed in your eyes to create a better game than HL, no matter what they did. I think you’re looking at the game through nostalgic glasses, which is a pretty powerful thing. They have the ability, with hindsight, to make terrible films amazing and cheesy games incredible. When I was younger I used to love films such as Godzilla, The Lost World and The Mummy because they were some of the first films that I saw in the cinema. They were visually engaging and I loved to be entertained by them. However, seeing them again now I realise that there’s a big difference between an <span class="bbcode-i">enjoyable</span> film and a <span class="bbcode-i">good</span> film. Enjoyable films tend to be the blockbuster hits, and while some are good, popularity and the amount of money made in no way equates to a quality film. Take a film that has been consistently counted as one of the greatest films of all time, ‘Shawshank Redemption,’ and you see that it was one of the least successful films commercially.</p>
<p>This is generally how I feel with a lot of games, including Half-Life. I played HL2 before HL, simply because that was the moment that I really got into video games. For me, although I absolutely love HL and its ability, even now, to immerse you completely, I do feel that it’s quirky, tongue-in-cheek and occasionally inelegant delivery is firmly suited in 1998.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2 at the time felt gritty, new, exciting, dark and intriguing. It had story, character, plot, action, suspense, tension, fear, and excitement in spadefuls, whereas HL tended to neglect the details of its story and focus more on gameplay. To me, HL2 felt more intelligent.</p>
<p>However, I think we’re both coming at each other from opposite ends of the spectrum, as we’re both being blinded partially by nostalgia. If I were to play HL2 now, unmodified, I would find 60% to be fairly boring because I know every inch of it. However, as a first playthrough in 2004, when the graphics were outstanding and the physics were miles ahead of the game, HL2 seemed to have no fault. I was never bored by the long sections of vehicle gameplay because I had no idea what was coming next, and I believe that it is on <span class="bbcode-i">those</span> merits that a game should be judged. In order to make a clear, unbiased opinion about a game, you need to play it without any prior hype and also when it is released, so that the graphics and physics can be rightly compared with other games of its ilk.</p>
<p>I wish I could go back to when HL was just such an innovation, to when it was considered groundbreaking for NPCs to even open their mouths when speaking. But I can’t, just like I can’t go back and experience HL2 for the first time. I think we’re both guilty of judging our separate games on unfair grounds. For me, I’m unable to view HL without seeing graphics and a story that are far inferior to HL2. For you, I think you expected a very different game and judged it on what <span class="bbcode-i">you</span> felt was right and wrong rather than on the game itself. HL was an untouchable beacon, and I think you probably played it <span class="bbcode-i">wanting</span> it to be worse than HL, even if only a little. Perhaps it will be one of those things that you’ll come back to in a year’s time and replay and be blown away.</p>

            <p>Gawddamit…  The point was that they were totally different beasts.  Yes, Pong, Tetris, and all those awesome games will always be unmatchable by anything, but you can’t really go say that Halo is a better game than Pong, because, as stated, they don’t exactly equate.  At all…</p>
<p>On a side note, Tetris is addicting.  AND NOT A WORD??? WTF MOZILLA!  That should totally be a default word.</p>
<p>On an even more side (and completely unrelated) note:  Did you know that the original DOOM’s multiplayer reserved port 666?  That’s cool because ports 0-1023 have been reserved since Internet was born, and even WoW hasn’t whore’d itself a port in that range.</p>

            <p>Whoops, didn’t mean to imply that I stole it, lol.  He was just emptying his backpack and the 3-disc pack fell out.  I was like:  “Wuzzat?”  He’s like “a good old fps”  I wuz like “Wuzzat?” (I was, for all intents and purposes, due to my parents at the time, a gaming virgin before HL, I think the only games I had were Tomb Raiders (2,3,4, and maybe 5 at that time) and mechwarrior 2 and 3).  He’s like “see fo yoself.”  (he’s not black… in fact, he’s anything but black, so I don’t know why I imagined him that way just now…)</p>
<p>ANYWAY!  Then I took it home, installed it on my (at the time) crap computer.  Played it for like…  twelve hours straight.  Then I discovered “ZOMGWTFBBQMODS???”  And had another twenty hours of fun.  Then I found ZOMGHAMMER? and spent a few hours trying to get the right version (still hadn’t yet gotten steam), and worked on a really neat map.  Lost it when my computer was raped by CNN and Internet Explorer (walked upstairs to my computer spouting russian, with Internet Explorer open several dozen times and a CNN news feed of some cat and a hurricane…).</p>
<p>Then I gave the disc back to my friend, because I had found steam, and bought it for myself.  It was on sale for like 2 or 5 dollars or something when I found it.</p>
<p>And that’s the story of how I discovered the gaming world.</p>
<p>Thank you Half-Life.  You are the reason I went to college!  Well, you’re the reason I didn’t go to college for something else…  Seriously, I’m in a Game Design &amp; Development program.  'Tis cool.</p>
<p>As to HL1 vs HL2.  HL1 was an amazing game for it’s time.  HL2 was an amazing game for it’s time.  Can’t compare, if you ask me.  That’s like comparing…  Halo to… Pong.  Or maybe doom.</p>
<p>That’s the first Halo.</p>

            <p>I’ve been a firm Half-Life player since back in '99. It was the best FPS I had ever played, and I didn’t get past inbound untill Good old '02. A few years later, I got Half-Life 2 for my X-box, played it, and though it had pretty much none of the Half-Life 1 feeling. I then bought the Orange Box in late '07, where I mainly got it for Portal… But the other games were fun too. Except for TF2.</p>
<p>Also, I kinda feel like punching anyone that thinks HL2&gt;HL1 in the mouth.</p>

            <p>I found half-life when the original game disc fell out of my best friend’s backpack, junior year of highschool…  That was about 3 or 4 years ago.  Played that, thought it was awesome, then ran into a random “DOWNLOAD HALF-LIFE 2 FOR FREE!” ad, looked up half-life 2, found Steam, downloaded steam (became an avid Steam user), preordered the Orange Box, and proceeded to enjoy Half-Life 2.</p>

            <p>I agree with about HL, I played the original, then HL-Source, what I loved about it was like you said, I still play OF and Blueshift, storylines were perfect.</p>

What are your comparisons, thoughts, complaints?  Do you feel the HL game is important to the HL2 story?  You can just answer if you’d like, or continue reading for my thoughts as well…unfortunately I only have the experience of playing HL, countless times (OpFor and BluS as well), while waiting 6 years for HL2.</p>
<p>/slight rant</p>
<p>Finally HL2 arrives and while fun…just didn’t feel like HL, or what I thought a HL sequal should feel like (with regards to story and atmosphere/environments).  Now of course I was by no means expecting, or wanting, the same experience, but I was hoping for a game at least as memorable and impacting.</p>
<p>Now, I can’t offer you my own HL2 story, I’m just not creative like that, but I hate the creation and inclusion of the combine.  I don’t like the direction the story has gone (alien overlords?) and I also do not find the combine as memorable…I feel the HECU were more satisfying to kill, even though they took way too much damage, were a tad weak, and had “dumber” AI.  I also preferred fighting Xen creatures rather than those ant lion creatures (WTF is this starship troopers?).  However, the saving graces of HL2, IMHO, are ravenholm and the HL zombies…they definitely got that right.  I also felt vehicles only made the game feel larger and I honestly didn’t get much pleasure out of operating any of them…other than occasionally running people over.</p>
<p>IMO, Ravenholm helped with environment variability and had the most impact (included puzzles and platforming IIRC).  Something I feel HL was vastly superior with (Anamalous Materials vs. On A Rail vs. Surface Tension vs. Residue Processing vs. Lambda Core vs, Xen etc.).  Other than Ravenholm I was in some European-like city, some coastal location, maybe a mine or a prison and I think that’s about it.  I remember the Citadel…I thought it was kind of bland.</p>
<p>After I finished HL2, I wanted still wanted the HL experience again.  I missed the atmosphere and tension from 6 years earlier.  In HL, it felt like I was racing against the clock to save humanity…not so much in HL2: I feel like if Gordon died, some badass rebel might just take his place. After all, anyone can wear an HEV suit.</p>
<p>Even though I only played HL2 a handful of times and each episode once, I do not think HL2 did HL justice.  I do think HL2 should have been made (I do like the style and art, gameplay is fun) just not called HL2 and not featuring Gordon Freeman and company.</p>
<p>/ends rant; ducks to avoid flung objects</p>
