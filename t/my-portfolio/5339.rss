<p>I was looking at the broader picture, if you are applying as a webdesigner then yes you are correct.</p>

            <p>I already have one, I don’t know much about webdesign but I don’t rate ones skill by simply looking at his/her portfolios frontpage for a few seconds and determining whether or not he/she has what it takes. Especially when the person involved is applying for something that has absolutely nothing to do with webdesign.</p>

            <p>Why would anyone at HR or even someone directly involved with the job look further if his first impression is “wtf is this and what do I do?”. It’s your job to impress them straight away, it’s your job to pop out, it’s your job to invite them to look further.</p>
<p>Hardly anyone will have the time or interest in digging through a pile of needles in order to find the golden straw.</p>
<p>If you truly believe that a company will carefully read every application they get -plus- actively check the portfolio in detail, then you’re going to be disappointed immensely when you’re going to look for a job.</p>
<p>Can’t find the reference right now, but I have a book somewhere that states that you have 6 seconds to persuade someone to check the rest of your portfolio out.</p>

<p>True, but unless you’re applying for a job at McDonalds you atleast expect to get reviewed properly. Otherwise it would be like ‘derp de herp he has too many pages hes probably a horrible model and texture artist what a complete naab, NEXT PLEASE’</p>

            <p>Same.</p>
<p>I’m talking with a friend who owns a web development bureau to see whether we can work out something that actually works well (not this crappy AS3 attempt by me) with that design.</p>
<p>No idea what I’m going to do with it, might be able to sell the whole thing to a custom guitar shop or something, dunno. I just like it well enough to properly develop it.</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t call my work fantabulous, seeing as I’ve mainly been designing for B2B as it is, so design-wise they’re nothing special (have to stick to the corporate branding, after all), but in terms of structure and navigation they do their job.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.candymonster.be/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.candymonster.be/</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://esko.com/web/site.aspx?p=4747" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://esko.com/web/site.aspx?p=4747</a> (note: the site itself isn’t my work, it was made 4 years ago by somebody else. However, the product page itself is my work (everything right from the dotted line, and below the main header).</li>
<li>
<a href="https://blog.esko.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://blog.esko.com/</a> (Wordpress skin, completely by me)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://esko.com/contest" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://esko.com/contest</a> (mini-site for a contest we did)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those last 3 obviously are from the same company and thus have limits in as far as one could go.</p>
<p>Concept websites I did back in college:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outdated portfolio: <a href="https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Portfolio/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Portfolio/</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Upload/De%20Pont%20Rootfolder/#" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Upload/De%20Pont%20Rootfolder/#</a></li>
<li><a href="https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Upload/Zuella%20Rootfolder/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Upload/Zuella%20Rootfolder/</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Osprey%20Site/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Osprey%20Site/</a> (only bottom link works (all-round))</li>
<li><a href="https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Upload/Lawsense%20Rootfolder/NL/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Upload/Lawsense%20Rootfolder/NL/</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Portfolio/v2/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://users.telenet.be/bolteh/Portfolio/v2/</a> (WIP of my new portfolio that I should really finish some day)</li>

            <p>Well, my point is, when you’re presenting a portfolio, you want to make it as convenient as possible for the people who are tasked with reviewing it. You might earn a few extra points for making your portfolio more creative than just a page with pictures and your contact info on it, but you won’t lose anything for having an extremely simple design.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is basically why I mentioned a single-page layout for each section aside from ease of navigation. You want all your work to be visible at a glance. If someone in a HR department somewhere can’t figure out how to navigate and reaches what they think is the ‘end’ then they might move onto the next applicant without reviewing all of your work, you want to avoid this at all costs! If you’re going after web and graphic design positions then a more creative portfolio would be encouraged, but if you’re going after animation or game jobs you just need something simple to show off your work.</p>
<p>With regards to making a multi-page layout more navigable; changing the colors on your buttons or making them larger is one option; a bright color (or even an arrow that has a colored ‘stroke’ around it) is going to stand out a little more. Alternatively having some sort of separate nav bar with page numbers and back/fwd buttons (perhaps centered at the bottom) might help, but it wouldn’t really fit without doing a page redesign, imo…</p>

            <p>You’re better off having an online portfolio that looks solid but has nothing too fancy in terms of techniques used, than having one that looks and feels like you have no idea what the shit you’re doing.</p>
<p>Back in college, it was easy to impress my teachers/instructors because they didn’t expect professional results, they just wanted me to show them that I learned something. But when I went to apply for jobs using the very same portfolio, the professionals weren’t impressed, they often found it bland, unoriginal and badly made (and hey, they were right).</p>
<p>It’s best to show something simple that is just spot on, than showing something wild that misses the ball on every aspect.</p>

<p>Yea… I had a big review yesterday with most of the animation instructors, they all liked it. I’m going to get rid of that pic on the front and replace it with something else.</p>

<p>Yea. I didn’t even try with this. Last time I tried to do something with it, people bitched about the font and positioning and just said keep it super simple… so I did. It does look boring though.</p>

            <p>Then I’d suggest you learn some web design and HTML. A portfolio is often the first thing a possible employer will see, and if this is the thing he sees first, then you already blew your first impression, imho.</p>
<p>Golden tip if you don’t know HTML or webdesign: keep it simple, that way you have less chance of making something hideous. Having some basic typography styling shouldn’t be too hard for someone who studies arts and media.</p>

            <p>Looks great, but I have two points of criticism (besides what has already been said):</p>
<ol>
<li>The text on the homepage looks cheap (imo), I’d consider using another font.</li>
<li>I don’t know how knowledgeable you are of HTML, but having a complete page be a single image is generally a pretty bad idea. Try breaking the image up into separate parts (like buttons, background, the notebook) and assemble them using HTML. This results in a smoother experience and shorter loading times (on first visit, at least). What Rabid said about centring falls under this category as well.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Thanks Rabid, Yea the center thing, i left it on “browser default”, soo default must be left side. Easy fix.</p>
<p>Scrolling would be nice, but I’d like to stick with the sketchbook/pages thing. An ideas on making the next page button stand out?</p>

            <p>Two things -</p>
<p>*The webpage doesn’t center in the browser window.<br>
*In terms of user interface, I think having separate sections for each type of art is perfect, but you might want to consider having everything on a single page per-section. I didn’t even see the page scroll buttons at first, and the less clicking and navigation someone has to do on your portfolio, the better!</p>
