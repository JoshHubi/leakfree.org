    <title>Ladder issues</title>

    <description>Probably not a big deal, but I wanted to mention some of the ladders in game when you get to the top/bottom of them, won&#39;t let you get off the ladder. Moving in most directions while ur at the top of a ladder to get off it leaves you where you stand. After a bit of fidgeting with it in game, I&#39;m finally able to get off the ladder. I know jump can be used to get off ladders, but jumping from some ladders just takes you down to the previous level instead of to the platform you are climbing to.</description>
