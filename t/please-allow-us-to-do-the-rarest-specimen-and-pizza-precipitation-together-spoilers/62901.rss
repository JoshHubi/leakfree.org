    <title>Please allow us to do The Rarest Specimen and Pizza Precipitation together! [SPOILERS]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/please-allow-us-to-do-the-rarest-specimen-and-pizza-precipitation-together-spoilers/62901</link>
    <description>I am doing a 100% run for all the new achievements in order and I was planning to do all achievements in one run. This means that I have to do Purple Hat, Pizza Box, and Gas Canister together. Gas canister is fine but is there a way to allow us to do both Pizza and Hat together? I think many people would like to see Purple Hatted G-Man in Pizza Rain. Can&#39;t we just throw each of the props one after the other? This would allow us to teleport all three props wherever we need to use portals. (Including Nihilanth). Thanks.</description>
