    <title>If when you click Play, BMS doesn&#39;t launch...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/if-when-you-click-play-bms-doesnt-launch/9527</link>
    <description>I had this trouble a short while ago. To fix it, I did the following.

1) Opt out of the Steam Beta.
2) Verify in Tools that you have Source SDK Base 2007 installed.

Not sure if step 1 is entirely necessary, but it&#39;s what I did and suddenly it asked me to install the SDK Base when I clicked Play, so something in the Steam Beta may have been interfering.

Enjoy BMS!</description>
