Join us for a huge group activity, next Saturday (February 4th) at 11:00AM - 11: 30AM PDT (-8GMT) where we will be playing Half-Life 2.

Why are we doing this? It will be a fun way to rally together, put Half-Life back in the spotlight and draw more people to our cause. We are not asking or demanding for anything; it will simply be a huge group of Half-Life fans playing one of the best games ever made. Who knows, maybe Half-Life 2 will even reach the top ten games played for that day.

There will be more information posted later this week. I am looking forward to an exciting day with thousands of Half-Life fans.  :slight_smile:

I&#39;ll probably participate, but not in that 30 minute period.

What about you?</description>
