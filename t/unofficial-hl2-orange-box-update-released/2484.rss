    <title>Unofficial HL2 Orange Box Update Released</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unofficial-hl2-orange-box-update-released/2484</link>
    <description>Was lurking around Kotaku today when I found [url=https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1093025]this[/url]. It&#39;s a mod that updates Half Life 2 to Orange Box standards and includes the 360 Achievements as well! Pretty nifty, I say. Currently downloading it so I&#39;ll feedback later on. In the meantime here&#39;s a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R5Z8Vfv32s]comparison video[/url], an [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1o1lepo0uM]Achievements video[/url] and also a [url=https://www.gameupdates.org/details.php?id=3945]torrent[/url] for the mod.</description>

<p>Unless you consider :pirate:ing a non-steam version as an option, you do have a point there.<br>
Valves update on the graphics is very minor though.</p>

<p>I don’t think there is such “vanilla” version of HL2 anymore. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/3872/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Valve officially patched it already in 2010</a> adding achievements and “improved graphical effects”. Filip’s mod is said to be doing this same thing… better and at the same time not having bugs that were introduced by Valve’s official update.</p>

<p>What I mean is, in HL2 update, when I click on achievements, it tells me i must be logged into steam.  I cannot view them or achieve them.</p>
<p>The exact error is “you must be logged into steam to unlock or view achievements”</p>
<p>EDIT:  Upon further review, I cannot access the achievements in any of my games.  It must be a steam problem. Go figure.</p>

<p>If I may ask, what did Fakefactory show in his application to be representative of his ability, Or did he pretty much say, “Its me, Fakefactory, my work speaks for itself!”</p>

            <p>This Mod over Fakefactory’s IMO. Much better and only about 1 GIG to download compared to at least over 10GB.</p>
<p>A few oddities with it though… but if you can stand them its fine  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey guys. Saw a few questions on this thread so I thought I would enlighten. For those already in the know, just ignore me.</p>
<p>I talked a bit with the mod’s creator, Filip. Basically, he tried to mimic Valve’s HL2-to-OB-Engine update (which right now is only released for the 360). If memory serves, he did most of it just by watching videos of 360 footage. He even linked me to the low res youtube video series he used. Either way, he was basically just looking over the 360 HL2 as best he could and trying to make sure that all got over to the PC.</p>
<p>Considering the method, he did a pretty bang up job. However, please note this is not the original work Valve did on the update, so things will not be perfect. It does not have the subtle polish of Valve work. Apparently he missed a few things. Yes, there are still glaring bugs (such as the fact that Alyx lost a bunch of her facial animations). Also, he took the liberty of changing/updating a few things that are not in the official update (such as adding an Aurora Borealis effect, which I find puzzling).</p>
<p>This is good news for some. However, for those purists out there, we should still be getting an official update from Valve sometime as well. It was two or three emails I had seen from Gabe himself that prompted this PC update release fiasco to begin with, and that is also what prompted me to ask Gabe about it on the Steamcast Interview back in August. For those of you who didn’t hear it: Gabe did say the official update from Valve was coming. I have no idea what has taken them this long to release work that is basically finished… but that’s Valve for you  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Just in case, here’s the quote from Gabe Newell himself when asked about the PC HL2/EP1 Orange Box Engine Update:</p>
<p>“It’s something we said we would do and something we intend to do. We just need to find…you know there are trade-offs, right, spending time getting the engine enhanced and also doing commentary for Half-Life 1. One request I get a lot is having commentary tracks back on the original Half-Life. So, we’d like to do it. We just have to fit into a schedule when we also feel a lot of pressure to do Counter-Strike Source updates and do more Left 4 Dead content. It’d be a tough call, getting a new monster or new special infected out for Left 4 Dead 1 versus getting the engine updates out for the original Half-Life 2. You know we can look at that and see right now that a lot more people are playing Left 4 Dead than are playing Half-Life 2 and we know that if we actually did the updates a lot more people would play Half-Life 2 so it’s just a balancing act. But it is something we said we’re going do and we’ll get around to doing it. It’s just managing all of the things that people would like us to do, all of which we want to do.”</p>

<p>I’d approve, but including all of the maps in the download, plus making unnecessary stupid aesthetic changes kills it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I guess you’re just one of all those that seems to mistake this mod for Cinematic Mod. Half-Life 2: Update, as the mod is called, have been made while closely studying the differences between the PC edition and the 360 edition, and applying as many of these on the PC edition, and as correct as possible.</p>
<p>Now, Cinematic Mod on the other hands… The only thing in CM I can perhaps like a bit is one of the HD models of G-Man. Looks very true to the original. Everything else if pretty much trash.</p>

            <p>I think Valve is only updating HL2 into the EP3 engine, once it’s released. Same goes for EP1 and EP2… Maybe? I don’t know this is a very faint memory of an interview, Gabe might have just said they’re going to update to Orange Box.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
