    <title>Translating a sentence to the African Language</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/translating-a-sentence-to-the-african-language/7422</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently in the middle of a writing project, in which this sentence (Originally in Hebrew, as i&#39;m from Israel)
[b]&quot;i want you to know i&#39;m always with you.&quot;[/b]
Is a key and it&#39;s written in several languages around the world...

My problem is that one of the times it&#39;s suppose to be written in a Native African language, and i can&#39;t seem to find anygood translation source or anything to help me with it, anyone have any idea?

[u]tl:dr:[/u] I need to find a source for a Native African translator or something alike, thanks for the read&#39; and possibly help!  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>I’d try either Zulu or Swahili for it. Afrikaans does have words that it borrowed from some African languages.</p>

            <p>Jerry - I said “the African language” as in the Language of africa, and yes I know that there are alot of them, but a way to translate to any of them would be good. i thought it kinda obvious that’s what i meant…</p>
