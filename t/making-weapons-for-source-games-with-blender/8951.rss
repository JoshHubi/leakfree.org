            <p>I can’t think of a weapon modelling tutorial, but if you already have experience with complex modelling, then you won’t need one. Just make a basic model of any weapon you want, make sure there are movable and removable parts of the weapon (ex: trigger, magazine), get textures, smooth out the model so it’s not blocky, make sure the textures fit in good, make animations, etc. Since you want to replace a certain weapon, what you’ll need to do rename the model to EXACTLY whatever model you’re replacing, as well as the animations.</p>

            <p>Yeah, unfortunately the SMD tools aren’t all that good.<br>
If anyone knows of a tutorial for Source viewmodels in Blender, I would like to see it as well.</p>

<p>I’m afraid that’s all I can do <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> As you can see it’s not even that good and only works for outdated versions of Blender.</p>
