[FONT=&#39;Tahoma&#39;]Bientôt l&#39;été.
[/FONT][/SIZE]

[i]&quot;Smoke, drink, play music, play Chess™, speak French (to others!), walk along an Earth sea shore and discover its strangely absurd and picturesque secrets. All from the comfort of your orbital station’s polypurpose deck.

Bientôt l’été is an interactive program that uses realtime 3D videogame technology. In one part of the program you control an avatar —man or woman, the choice is yours— who walks on a simulated beach. Poetic phrases about love and loss roll in on the waves. These phrases are then taken inside, in the second part. Here you exchange moves on a chess board with another person on the internet, presumably playing your lover. You don&#39;t know who they are as the system matches you up automatically. &quot;[/i]

I have just received the Extravagant edition, which included the soundtrack and a flash drive containing the game and extras. It arrived in a small envelope which made a weird sound. When I opened it, I sand fell on my desk and one of the best perfume I ever encountered came to my nose. A woman&#39;s perfume. It also contained a picture of the digital sea, a blank card and the flash drive. This e-mail explains the blank card:

[i]We have a request:
Print it with your favorite poem 
or draw on it or use a typewriter or a pen and ink, 
Tell us about the seas of your homeworld.
Tell us about who you love.
Tell us what you&#39;re playing at.
Tell us how you&#39;re doing.
Put a stamp on it
Address it 
and send back to us&quot;[/i]

I was speechless. And I can still smell the envelope, I have to find what perfume it is.
