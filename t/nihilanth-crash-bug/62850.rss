    <title>Nihilanth Crash Bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/nihilanth-crash-bug/62850</link>
    <description>I just got to the final phase of the Boss fight with the Nihilanth but the game keeps crashing and kicking me to windows with this loud, constant noise that I can only get rid of with a system reboot.  When I load the game&#39;s autosave, I can move around and shoot at him, but if I quicksave and then try and reload after it bombs (Which it always does after about 3-5 minutes), it just immediately crashes again with that horrendous noise.  When I first got to this phase I was shooting at his exposed brain/crystal while dodging his fire, which was fine for a while, but then it crashed, so, now I can&#39;t finish the game.  I&#39;d supply the dump report but I don&#39;t know how to attach it to this message since I see no option for it.</description>
