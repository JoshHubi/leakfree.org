    <title>Crash error.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-error/9871</link>
    <description>Howdy.

 First, I would like to congratulate everyone who worked on the making of Black Mesa Source. It is great to see it shining in the dark. I do seriously believe that these are dark times for games...

  Second, in the game, at the part when you are in a.. some sort of a huge fridge, after you put the valve into that hole to operate it, at a part it crashes and an error message pops up.

Here is the message:&quot;Engine Error: Too many verts for a dynamic vertex buffer (38360&gt;32768) Tell a programmer to up VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE.&quot;

  I would appreciate it if anyone would read this and post an answer (if that person has one).

 Thank you for taking your time in reading this.




 P.S. post too serious and gloomy? Here, have a kitty.

            <p>For me it doesn’t matter if it works or not if I lower the settings, all it matters for me is only if its going to be FIXED or NOT, without me having to do any changes to the settings.</p>
