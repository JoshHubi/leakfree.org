    <description>[b]Spoiler Alert: discussion about blast pit gameplay[/b]

[b]Intro[/b]

I&#39;ve just obliterated the tentacle monster and so far black mesa has been awesome, because above all, shares with half-life 2 the total immersion of the player in the game world.

[b]About Backtracking[/b]

I&#39;ve never played at half-life so I didn&#39;t know how to get rid of tentacle.
It took a while to realize what to do and the backtracking didn&#39;t help.

Last FPS with backtracking I played has been Bioshock and I didn&#39;t love that part of gameplay.
Backtracking is not so common in recent fps games(there wasn&#39;t in half-life 2) and I guess I am not the only one [b]who felt lost[/b] in this part of game.

I didn&#39;t see that there were 2 door in tentacle room and after switching on the engine I didn&#39;t know what to do.

I had to watch on youtube a half-life walkthrought to realize how to continue.

[b]Advices[/b]

1- You should add more scripting or npc to help you to understand what to do.
2- Add something that helps to spot the 2 doors(green lights,panels or other)


I hope we can have an intresting discussion in this post about this matter...</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>For people who badmouth people who got confused, I direct you to the Portal 2 Developer Commentary. Run through the game and listen to the commentary, the note down how many things Valve changed because players were being confused by it. And almost all the things they changed weren’t made easier, just less misleading.</p>
<p>There’s a reason Valve’s games are as popular as they are, and it isn’t because they treat their players with tough love. Yes, there’s an element to figuring things out for yourself. As there should be. But there’s also an element of clarity in game design that avoids ways of being needlessly misleading. Hell, go back to Half Life and look at the console again. Virtually the ONLY things on it are huge signs saying Power, Oxy and Fuel for even the blind to see, yet we’re not saying that was too easy or too clear or not hard enough, are we?</p>
<p>Again, I’m a Half-Life veteran. I’ve replayed the original enough times to quote almost all of its locations from memory, and even remember most of the enemy spawns. I went into Blast Pit knowing precisely what to look for and what to do and I STILL couldn’t find where on the console “power” was even mentioned, before or after I switched it on. That console can use a redesign to make the power button less prone to being mistaken for cosmetic clutter.</p>

            <p>We’ve all gotten lazy with games like WoW and Skyrim giving us <span class="bbcode-b">GREAT BIG FUCKING ARROWS</span>[/SIZE] pointing to where we need to go and what we need to do.<br>
So it does take a bit of getting used to when we have to suddenly use our brains to work something out ourselves.<br>
Keep at it and you’ll get into the whole ‘thinking for yourself’ thing.</p>
<p>I admit that I too had a shock when I had to use my brain.  There sure was a lot of dust on it.</p>

<p>Yeah, and that’s why you shouldnt be given everything beforehand.<br>
Every puzzle takes its own time to solve and even if you find it quick or slow its an accomplishment. Either it’s like: Hell yeah, I solved that so quick, Im so smart. Or it’s like: Bloody hell, that was hard but I did it!! And now they burn in hell!</p>

            <p>I agree that this portion was a bit confusing. After turning on fuel and oxy, i thought i was finished. I should have known the team wouldn’t have made killing the tentacles this easy, though. The problem I had was that I couldn’t really see the door on the ground level and the power indicator on the console wasn’t very clear. I assumed it was just random bits like other consoles had throughout the rest of the game. All in all, though this was a minor, if annoying, hitch in the pacing and can be easily remedied if they want to.</p>

            <p>Yeah, Blast Pit is fine as it is. It’s cool not having the game tell you exactly what to do and where to go.</p>
<p>And I really don’t understand why people play this mod, yet haven’t played the original Half-Life? I understand that these people have played Half-Life 2 and all that, but wouldn’t you want to play HL1 after doing that? It just doesn’t really make sense to me.</p>

<p>The dying scientist you encounter tells you that you need to fire the rocket engine.  Then, you enter a room where a scientist is futilely smashing his hand on a big red button labelled “fire” before he gets dragged off.  “Hmm… there must be something wrong with the engine!  Maybe the conspicuous indicator lights on this control panel next to the big red button could give me a clue.”  Then, the first guard you encounter tells you that he’s going to “make a break for the generator room” (or something to that effect), and that you’re welcome to join him - a change made in Black Mesa, because in Half-Life, he only tells you that you need to be quiet.  When you look out into the silo from the platform you enter on, <span class="bbcode-i">you can see both of the doors you need to go through.</span>  The guard who shouts “eat lead, you giant outer space octopus” distracts the tentacles for a few moments so you can sneak out onto the platform and have a look at the room before they come for you - another change that was made in Black Mesa, by the way, because in the original, that guard is standing on the platform you enter on, which draws the tentacles right to you.  Maybe if you’d stopped to assess the situation before you charged into a room full of giant tentacle monsters, you wouldn’t have gotten stuck.</p>

<p>I was pretty sure that when I tossed a grenade down their hole, they all retreated…either that or the game was glitching for me but they definitely dropped for a few seconds.  Then when they returned, they started on the lowest level, then moved up after like 10 seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The game was not glitching for you. That’s exactly how it works and how to pass through that room easily. Throw grenade down the hole, walk to the ladder, hope that the ladder system works correctly, climb one level down and get off the ladder, throw the next grenade. If you’re quick enough, you won’t be bothered by the tentacles.</p>

<p>I was pretty sure that when I tossed a grenade down their hole, they all retreated…either that or the game was glitching for me but they definitely dropped for a few seconds.  Then when they returned, they started on the lowest level, then moved up after like 10 seconds.</p>

            <p>I like how there are giant signs with red light / green light indicators telling you that the silo is READY. That means you did the puzzle correctly.</p>
<p>In the control room just a bit of reading and looking at the lights will tell you pretty much what you’re supposed to do. It wasn’t all too much of an issue.</p>
<p>There could have been larger signs directing you to the FUEL ANNEX and GENERATOR though.</p>

            <p>Let’s say, the guy who tells you what to do could go a little more into detail of what you’re supposed to do, but otherwise its good the way it is. He says that thing can hear you, so you probably think you can sneak past. If you can’t, the design is in some way flawed. Maybe you should get a little hint on how to distract the tentacles.</p>
<p>As for the backtracking, I remember figuring it out when I first played Half-Life. I admit I was confused as well, but Gregorovich! pretty much got it to the point. You must examine the environment, think and then act, something which distinguishes the Half-Life experience from modern shooters! And to be honest, I can’t quite agree with the complaints about the tentacles. Like lucifer said, you don’t really wanna stay in that room for long anyway. Rush through the room, keep throwing grenades and the tentacles won’t hit or even notice you.</p>

</aside>
<p>Or maybe their way of locating sounds have been improved with better use of AI. I agree that they do not act the same as they did in Half-life, and yes its a shame you can’t sneak past by them. But the rushing method was always my appoach anyway. Because frankly, they scare me. I don’t want to be in the same room as this creature for a long time.</p>

            <p>^Yup.</p>
<p>And there’s a reason as to why you are FEEDED with grenades laying everywhere in this chapter!</p>
<p>I’d say its easy to get through without loosing hit points.<br>
For me, in every case you distract someone, you must act QUICK in order to sneak by undetected.<br>
If you’re trying to take someones wallet (pocket thief) you don’t distract and go slow, you distract and go like lightning.<br>
Same goes, distract and run like bloody hell to the door.<br>
Also, one easy spot to not get attacked is the ladders!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’s a typical Half-Life moment where patrons of more modern shooters literally have no idea what to do. If you actually look around in the control room, it’s blatantly obvious that Oxygen, Fuel and Power are required to test-launch the rocket. And yeah, the security guard, and all the scientists along the way tell you pretty much what to do. I found it pretty straight-forward in the original game and I have no problem with it in Black Mesa - if anything it’s more clear what you need to do.</p>
<p>As for the difficulty of actually getting past the tentacles, however, that is a completely different story. Even on easy, the tentacles are maybe a 2-3 hit kill with decent suit power, and throwing grenades does pretty much nothing, even if you’re crouch-walking. In addition to that, actually getting your crowbar out to break down the barriers of each door is a royal pain in the ass.</p>
<p>The strategy I’ve devised is pretty much to first throw grenades at the wooden barriers before you reach them in order to blow them up easily, and then throw more grenades to either the very bottom or very top floors, so that when you do start making your way over to the door, they have to change multiple layers to get to you, which can give you vital seconds to run away. Following that, you can access the bottom floor passage from the middle floor passage by just falling down the hole at the right angle which can solve a little grief.</p>
<p>But yeah, the tentacles are immune to any kind of attack and grenades will only distract them for a couple of seconds before they find you again, even if you’re crouching. Even on easy, it’s almost impossible to get through this section without taking damage. Which I could do with ease in the original.</p>

<p>nope. he doesn’t say that you have to switch on the engine and open the valves.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, but it’s pretty clear that you need to activate the power and fuel, and that the valves and the generator are how you activate the fuel and power. It’s not that complicated.</p>

<p>The monster simply distracts you because you are  only focused  on how to get out<br>
you do not  have time to look around.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting to change  the tentacle AI,<br>
just make more understandable what to do and,above all,<br>
put something near the doors the help you to see that there are 2 way out from the blast pit.</p>

            <p>Actually they made it easier by allowing you to jump down to the lowest level where you jump over on the the middle level because the ceiling fell down on the catwalk.<br>
You can jump down to the lower catwalk and continue.</p>
<p>This was the first thing I saw and I was like, hey. Nice, I don’t have to face the tentacles again when I come back from the fan thingy!</p>
