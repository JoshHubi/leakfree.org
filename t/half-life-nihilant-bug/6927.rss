    <title>Half-Life Nihilant bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-nihilant-bug/6927</link>
    <description>Hello there. So, I have got to the Nihilant level in Half-Life. I go trough the red teleport, and then I fall to the Nihilant room. But it seems to be bugged. There are no yellow crystals, and there are green electric stuff coming from the Nihilant. 
This happens every time I go to that room. Seems like it doesn&#39;t load up properly.
I could try to reinstall, but how do I keep my save games? Is there any other solution than reinstall?</description>

<p>have you ever completed HL1 before? The final boss shoots teleports at you and you have to complete a puzzle to get to the top, back into the boss room through another portal.</p>
<p>If you’re already in the boss room and the crystals aren’t there, you definitely need to reload the game, it’s only around 900MB so you can delete it first to make sure the error doesn’t stick.</p>

<p>Yes, I have completed it previously.</p>
<p>It actually looks like crystals have been destroyed already when I teleport in there. There is green electric stuff coming from Nihilant, and his head is open. So I could kill him and complete the game, but that wouldn’t feel right.</p>
<p>I guess I will try to reinstall, and keep the save game just before I go to Nihilant level.</p>

            <p>other people on the forum probably know more than me but i’ll try to help.<br>
Verify integrity of game files and de-fragment your cache files. if that doesn’t work you can back-up your save files and re-install.<br>
(this is all assuming you are using steam)</p>
