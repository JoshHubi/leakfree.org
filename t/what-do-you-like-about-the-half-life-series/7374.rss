    <title>What do you like about the Half-Life series?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-do-you-like-about-the-half-life-series/7374</link>
    <description>Hey guys, second post and first thread.
I&#39;m such a big fan of the Half-Life series [COLOR=&#39;Yellow&#39;]and I just want to let you know and I want to know of you: What do you like about the Half-Life series?

I like for instance that there are only a few cutscenes (Only when G-man interferes) but mostly cinematics that allows you to walk and look around while these things happen.

I like the many easter eggs.

I like the variety of characters.

I like the emotional tensions during the game.

I like many more!...

Tell me!

greetz

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]Edit: This topic is a bit too broad so I&#39;m changing the question in: &quot;[u]What don&#39;t you like about the series and/or what would you like to change in it?[/u]</description>

            <p>Didn’t think people still would even bother to answer this thread  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Both Overjoyedlemur and Ryan make a very good point. Variety is a good word to choose because valve succeeds in putting variety in everything which makes the game worthwhile. And yes, Alyx’ tight pants is nice but I guess we can all agree on that! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Haha ty (hoping that wasn’t a sarcastic comment). I try to speak more formal because if it gets too informal people will take things too personal. That’s how I try to prevent conflicts. Which is very hard of course.<br>
Too bad this thread wasn’t much of a succes. Better luck next time, I guess.</p>

<p>No, it is more so, because this forum consists of people that love the series and are waiting for a remake of it’s revolutionary original title, so it is pretty obvious that most forum members will like many aspects of the series. Thus making this thread pointless.</p>

<p>I know that everybody loves the Half-Life series. I did not ask: <span class="bbcode-i">do you like the Half-Life series?</span> I asked <span class="bbcode-u">what</span> aspects people like of the Half-Life series.<br>
If you don’t like this thread, then don’t answer it. Giving criticism on my thread is not helping you, me or even the community.</p>

            <p>My favorite is the variety in atmospheric environments between each episode of Half-Life. I prefer Episode 2.<br>

            <p>Good point Beejoo. The music does give more tension and excitement. I listened to the songs for Black Mesa which are good, but most of them are a bit soft and melow. I hope they add more up tempo songs for more excitement.</p>

            <p>City 17, (like most places in HL:2) always reminds me of a home-like place.<br>
The way Valve made it look like a rundown city is very impressive. Its also looks more impressive for a place to run a rebellion. Old building make it look like a post WW2 terrain, making it easy for anyone to relate to, and also be able to set a ‘scene’ without really having to explain to the gamer what happened previously.<br>
Although… if you were ever to see yourself (as in Gordon Freeman) in that city… i bet you’d think you’d look out of place.<br>
Bright orange and black suite, when everyone is wearing dark blues and greys.<br>
you must look odd. But still, you’re a Doctor in Theoretical Physics, and hence were trained to kick some butt!</p>

            <p>Yes, the environment looks so good. From open areas in mountains and forests to the dark, claustrophobic places of the mines. The very first time I entered city 17, I was astonished. The environment really showed the oppression by the combine. You open the doors and the first thing you see is that big citadel that symbolizes its power over the city (world).</p>
