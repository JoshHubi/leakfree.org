    <title>Allegedly first and original DUMP of POLYBIUS found.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/allegedly-first-and-original-dump-of-polybius-found/7004</link>
    <description>This happened in Argentina, it was in hands of an engineer and were stole by a hacker in 1996, he found the file now &#39;cause he couldn&#39;t decrypt it back in those times(and even today) and were in an old Hard Disk. The coding is very interesting and weird for those times. You can check the file and try to decrypt it if you&#39;re an old programmer, but maybe it&#39;ll cost much more than it looks.

Check the file out:
[url]https://newserverclear.site90.com/polybius/POLYBIUSDUMPBCK.7z[/url]

And check the post in an Argentinian website.

[url]https://www.taringa.net/posts/juegos/9932721/Primera-parte_-Al-fin-la-verdad___-Polybius.html[/url]

I post this because it looked very... VERY interesting and extremely consistent history. This file will go over the world, i&#39;m sure of it.</description>

<p>Anyone ever see that John Carpenter episode of Masters of Horror called “Cigarette Burns” with <span class="bbcode-i">La Fin Absolue Du Monde</span>?</p>
<p>That movie was way cooler than Polybius.</p>

<p>I loved that episode. The entire show was awesome.</p>

            <p>I guess it’s all bullshit then. Too sad, that story made my day. Anyway thousands of people fell off on that shit. Today they closed the comments in that post(too many curses xD).</p>
<p>It looked interesting and(I admit it) I believed in that story 'cause of my ignorance, but wasn’t sure until i posted here and discover what kind of bullshit it’s.</p>
<p>PD : The guy posted that he get laid a lot, is that a lie too? Maybe… Maybe…<br>

<li>The issue and 7z 7zip.<br>
One of the major attacks or excuses that have my detractors to show that there is a trout after my post is that the 7zip format (which compresses the ROM) is 1999, which, my history to have found it in 1996 would be false. Here we go:<br>
This if I have arto; to see Come again, The 7z format is a compression format, similar to what is the zip or rar. 7zip is asoftware created by Igor Pavlov in 1999 used LZMA algorithms (which is 98 ) and PPMD ​​(that’s 1991, born jurisdiction of zip used by programmers primarily for its ability to compress text (which incidentally is excellent))<br>
Despite this, nowadays, you usually 7zip reports the LZMA compression format is because it is used to decompress PPMD ​​too.<br>
Anyway, the 7z is the algorithm that encodes the actions of PPMD, ie a form of compression used 7z.<br>
7zip is a visual environment 7z (A GUI) as it is the RAR WINRAR (notice but believe me, that the route installation of WINRAR C rogram rar.exe FilesWinRAR this file is the command line.<br>
It may be that no one has understood?? For more information onMagazine PC lusers (do not leave me here in Taringa put the real name, so I take the L ok?) In the first edition which came gift floppies, appears as an option 7z compression (at that time, there were options today Today everyone uses rar, zip, or 7zip)<br>
From last, if everything is an invention, I would send such a shit? Do not believe the care you use to assemble the storygo to put a format old as zip, rar, or pk ??? Think!</li>

<p>Somebody made this game based on mythical descriptions of what  Polybius was supposed to be. I haven’t played it but I imagine it’s a bunch of strobey, flashing, oscillating primary colors designed to give you a headache.</p>
