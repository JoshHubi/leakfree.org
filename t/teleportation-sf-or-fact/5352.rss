    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/teleportation-sf-or-fact/5352</link>
    <description>Could be old news, but found it some time ago, and decided to share. Some would find it interesting.
Small note: The article make extensive use of quantum mechanics.

<p>I have thought about this before and it’s a pretty scary thought. Admittedly, no one is certain how consciousness works or what it is tied to, but I believe it is most likely tied to the physical matter making up your brain. If that is so, those kinds of ‘fax’ transporters would kill anyone who enters and create a new person who acts exactly like the original; a clone. But there’s no way to find out for sure, because the person who comes out the other side would always say it was still him because whether he was the original consciousness or a clone, he’d believe he was the original. The only way to ever know would be to do it yourself and see if you come out the other side. :retard:</p>
<p>In any case, one thing’s for certain - I’m not ever using a transporter unless I know exactly how it works and I know it’s transporting my original matter and not making a copy.</p>

<p>Star Trek teleportation “works” by scanning the body and creating a ‘pattern’ of the person which is then placed in the pattern buffer. It’s this pattern which is teleported to the destination where the person is reconstituted from the pattern. The original person is, as you suspect, destroyed. It’s a horrific thought when you stop to think about it but that’s generally glossed over unless it’s important for story drama when something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Of course, it goes without saying that that’s entirely fiction and wouldn’t remotely work in real life, I was just answering the question. Consider trying to ‘scan’ 7 * 10^27 atoms and transmitting that amount of information.</p>

<p>This is pretty much it.  This is not teleportation in the classic sense, but rather two objects are “entangled”, and will always instantly match up with the other, so you’re kinda “teleporting” . . . physics or some silly thing like that.  It’d be more useful for data transmission since you wouldn’t have to broadcast anything through radiant energy or conducted through wire, but rather by manipulating a particle that’s entangled with another, near-instant data transmission.</p>
<p>Also, humans could very well be written in binary, in many different ways, depending on what you wanted to accomplish.<br>
If you were doing byte stuffing, i.e. just trying to cram all our data into as small a string of computer language as possible, a human would be around 800MB, not including any data required to HANDLE the human blueprints.</p>
<p>If you actually want to simulate the code’s function with efficiency and accuracy, or save space, you’ll need to add extra information for indexing, shorthand data representing unnecessary repetition, and even MORE code before it all to actually guide the functions.  Or, you could recreate the relative function of the actual genetic machinery, but that would probably take EVEN MORE time, since you’d have to design very complex molecular simulations to account for all the big and little details that happen while all the countless different parts and scraps and machines work on, with, and around the DNA.</p>

<p>Entanglement is only possible with individual particles, so you can’t, say, teleport a kitten. It’s not possible in our universe. Now, if you had another dimension where it did work, you could perhaps work through there, where it is possible. Xen, perhaps?</p>
<p>Edit: Meh, I didn’t expect you guys to be smarter than the OP. My bad.</p>
<p>Also, as for the idea that time is not the fourth dimension, it is AFAIK, but it <span class="bbcode-i">also</span> can be used as an alternative way to travel through space. Of course I could just be an idiot.</p>
<p>Also, I prefer wormholes. They’re actually a lot more practical than entanglement, needing only an insane amount of energy (dark energy for instance would work), and with the added bonus of being possible on a larger scale. Plus, if I understand right, entanglement would actually <span class="bbcode-i">copy</span> you.</p>

            <p>Yep, that and the fact Euclidean space doesn’t specifically reference time dilation. With Minowski space specifying that “time <span class="bbcode-b">is the</span> fourth dimension”, it means the faster you move according to the first three Euclidean dimensions, the slower you move through time (assuming we’re all going steady at the speed of light through all of them).</p>
<p>Interesting you should draw that observation, though, since a form of <span class="bbcode-i">centrifugal</span> force would be the only thing allowing us to enter a fourth <span class="bbcode-i">Euclidean</span> dimension.</p>

            <p>Does that quote basically mean something like “Centrifugal force isn’t a real force on its own, but for the most part treating it like one works just fine.”?</p>

<p>The fourth dimension is something we cannot interpret. Our three-dimensional world has depth in it, the same way coins on a table have a thickness, but sliding them around they do not overlap.</p>
<p>Imagine now a curved table, to which the coins are drawn. The coins are drawn so intensely, in fact, that the coin must move at a speed we know as <span class="bbcode-i">the speed of light</span> in order for centripetal force to bring it above the surface of this table. Being flat-lying coins, they have no other means of gaining altitude in this extraneous dimension. The real humour is that once the coin surpasses this critical speed, it has an escape-velocity, so some method must slow it down in order for it to fall back to the table.</p>

If you’re talking about something like wormholes, which do not involve superluminal speeds but the bending of spacetime (ooh, those pesky four dimensions again) you’re still not going to a new dimension or anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Space is bent, curved along a dimension that we cannot interpret. Any velocity under the speed of light is pressed into our three-dimensional space. Exceeding this velocity, as an escape velocity along the event horizon, allows us to enter the fourth dimension and circumvent material in our three dimensions, but it must decelerate somehow to return to normal space.</p>
<p>Its return into normal space will be quite traumatic, probably not survivable, and also much further into our future, but it will have disappeared and reappeared elsewhere, with its journey having circumvented all observable matter.</p>
<p>I maintain that exceeding the speed of light does not, as popular believe claims, send one back in time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You don’t half talk a load of shit. The funniest bit was when you asserted that popular belief was that exceeding the speed of light sends you back in time.</p>
<p>Using long words and convoluted grammar does not make you look intelligent. It makes you look like an idiot.</p>
