    <title>Original Gibs system suggestion</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/original-gibs-system-suggestion/13943</link>
    <description>I realize the new system was altered to mimic the original HL, but could it be possible to change it back to the original 2012 mod version were they only gib after and npc has died. I felt the old way keep the hl2 feel but still kept the spirit of HLs. I Enjoyed seeing ragdolls fly more  :smiley:   and then see them gib if you wished to do some overkill. Anyone else feel that way</description>

<p>Would like to point out that with the new gib system, creatures and NPCs became way too fragile.<br>
I do not want to see giblets all the time a grenade goes off next to a marine. Throw some ragdolls in.</p>
<p>What we had in 2012 version was pretty much bang on.</p>

<p>The gibbing system is unfinished as it was an emergency rewrite. That’s an issue that is on our scope for a fix, along with the missing particles.<br>
Fun tidbit: when the new gibbing system was first rewritten and tested, everything that died in MP would be gibbed, no matter what. Gibbing someone with a Crowbar or watching them gib from fall damage was seriously hilarious, I almost wish we’d kept it.</p>
