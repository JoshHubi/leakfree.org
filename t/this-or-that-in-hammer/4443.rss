    <title>This or that in Hammer?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/this-or-that-in-hammer/4443</link>
    <description>A few years back, I learned from a tutorial in Worldcraft (that is what I was using at the time) to make maps for Half-life ( 1998 ) that I could make a perfect cube by switching the grid size to 256, then filling in four units and making a brush like that, then hollowing it by -16. Now I&#39;m using the Source Engine and this tutorial says to create walls and floor and ceiling individually. Should I do that? And can I please not be flamed to a crisp? :retard: ^_^ Thanks in advance. I would also like to know some of your methods and tips because I&#39;m a total noob with Source.</description>

            <p>There are many wonderful links at <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">VDC (Valve developer community site)</a> and they contain many useful tips and tricks for future mappers</p>
<p>If you’re not satisfied with that, check out <a href="https://www.interlopers.net/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Interlopers</a> and search them for tutorials.</p>
<p>And never use carve. It may look simpler, but you end up ruining your brushes, so rather go and clip them. It’s more time consuming but you end up in fantastic brushes!<br>
Edit: Just noticed it. Dumb me.</p>
