    <description>variation idea: flare guards

flare guards are your normal npc guard but with a AI upgrade (melee) and 2 flares on their belt which they will toss at hostiles or in dark areas. this is a variation of the guard that is rarely seen.
(only reason posting this is I am bored. I know it will not be added)

what is different from normal guard
1. has 2 flares on belt, they will toss them in dark areas, or toss them at zombies.
2. has a melee attack unlike normal guards, making them ok in close range. (will try to hit the hostile with their pistol)

locations where they would be
1. the first follow guard after incident, reason he needs to look stronger as the player is unarmed and he will show that you can light up zombies with flares. this is also the guard at the door before the event.(watched some lets plays people can&#39;t put 2 and 2 together)
2. the first revolver guard in office complex, reason he is a bad ass.
3. the guard with the armory in surface tension(think right level), reason just for show.
4. all guards in the lamda labs, reasons guards suck in that area.


other things

bug reports on guards
1.shotgun does what, they may hold shotguns but I have yet to see one of them fire the dam thing and I have played the mod through 5 times now.
2.script fail, some times a guard will bug out on scripted jesters example the guard in the surface tension armory if shot once will keep both hands on weapon.
3.run up and stand, have had 3 time where a guard would just run up to and stand in front of a hostile (all 3 times was that first follow guard), they really need a melee.</description>

            <p>CONCEPT:<br>
Keep the headcrab latch mechanic out, but take inspiration from it to give guards a meelee attack where they have some random chance of completely avoiding damage from a headcrab attack but become temporarily immobilized as they grapple with the headcrab.</p>
