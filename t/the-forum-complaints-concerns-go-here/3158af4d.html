<p>The problem with people acting like assholes to be funny is that people who don’t get the joke think that it’s okay to actually BE an asshole, and when you’re acting like an asshole to be funny, the only thing keeping YOU from actually BEING an asshole is if you managed to be funny. If you failed to be funny, then blaming the other guy for not getting the joke doesn’t negate your assholery</p>

<p>And it DOES make a difference if someone is mean to you on the internet. No, not on a personal level, but there’s no fucking need for it, and instead of it being just one single-post thread that could be ignored and gets buried within a few days, it becomes a 12 page bag of shit that pushes threads that actually have a topic off the first page. That makes a difference to me, and any other member who is interested in finding worthwhile topics to contribute to and doesn’t want to waste their time wading through sewage to find them.</p>

<p>It is posts like this that seem to prove our point emphatically.</p>
<p>What is funny is you are making excuses for people, such as yourself, being condescending and a prick.  I do not understand why you feel the need to insult in almost all of your posts?  You bicker at everyone.  Talk about pot calling the kettle black.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>All I do is call upon people to use the English language relatively correctly - anyone over the age of ten from an English speaking country should be able to do that just fine. Just TRY is a great start, I don’t usually go too anal about it, especially if it’s just the odd missed capital or whatever here and there. I also pull people up on bullshit or plain stupidity - if you’re wrong, you’re wrong. Deal with it, accept it, learn from it. Don’t cry just because I don’t sugar coat it when I point it out to you. I make my point, and back it up with logic, reason, and facts etc. I’m not going to hold your hand and tell you it will be OK. THAT would be making excuses for people.</p>

<p>Shasta man, I’m sick of arguing with you.  However I find it insulting when you call me, and other forum members, stupid.  You don’t know our levels of education, calling people who may be more intelligent than you “stupid” only makes you seem silly and having the audacity to think you are more “educated” than them only makes you more appear more conceited than you seem to appreciate at the minute.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t need to know peoples level of education, nor do I bother disclosing mine. Their education and intelligence comes across perfectly clearly in their posts. I’m sick of people demanding everyone else to lower their standards of grammar and intelligence to their low level of comprehension so that they fit in, and because it’s “just the internet”. Not only that, but where does it end? Some people make an effort but get a few things wrong, some people go further and forego any punctuation, and others typ al thr stuf n txt. Where does it end? Just what level of laziness and stupidity is acceptable? Why is any of it acceptable? Is it really that hard to press a few extra keys, or are some people just that dumb? Why should everyone lower their standards to accommodate the retards?</p>
<p>And I am fully aware of how I come across. You seem to have incorrectly assumed that I am here to cultivate opinions of me, good or bad. Do you think I’m here to try and be everyone’s friend, and am just doing a really bad job of it or something lol?</p>

<p>I don’t want anyone to “boo hoo” at me, but I have come to realise in my 23 years that a bit of humilty gains you more friends and a better sense of humour.  I also think you may be a little naive if you think that asshattery on the forums endears anyone to the mod, or indeed the community that supports the mod.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wow, you just keep missing the mark. I guess your mere 23 years (lol aren’t you a big boy, let me know how you feel about all this when you reach my age) hasn’t been enough for you to learn a lot yet. Don’t worry, it will come. Again, you wrongly assume that I am here to make friends with everyone, that I have been employing humour in all my posts, that I am trying to endear myself to anyone in the mod or the community. You REALLY don’t know how to read people or understand points being made. Most people with intelligence, pride, self respect and a basic set of standards will tend to agree with my points, if not my methods of communicating them. You can’t win 'em all, but it’s nice to try and get/tell/teach/shock/humiliate people into raising their standards instead of expecting others to lower theirs. If that means a few people that I have not met/will never meet dislike me, then so be it.</p>
<p>I joined here because I am looking forward to the mod, and was hoping to discuss things with people that have similar interests. Instead I have found stupidity and laziness not only more common than usual, but actually being forced upon anyone that dares to ask for a higher (normal) standard of conversation. Yes, there are a few young ones here that get a little silly and I pretty much try to identify and ignore when possible, and of course people for whom English is not native to them deserve plenty of room with English mistakes.</p>
<p>I am still here as there are plenty of members that are “normal” and worth discussing things with or seeing what they have to say, to keep up with the mod and the dev team, and so on. It’s just a shame that a few of the morons are the “loudest” ones here, trying to drag everyone else down to their low standards of intellect, grammar and conversation.</p>
<p>*Cue obligitory complaints from the dummies about “TL;DR”, “Wall of text” etc, once again wanting people to lower their standards to suit their attention span and intellect lol.</p>

<p>Exactly, we’ve run out of things to talk about, so instead we complain about each others signatures and flame the newer members.</p>
<p>What we need is more solid topics for discussion, something that hasn’t been done before.</p>

<p>This is one member I try my hardest not to respond to… Maybe being hungover hasn’t helped too much  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Like anyone, I respect your opinions and you are more than entitled to them. However, what I don’t agree with is your crusade to ‘educate’ every member of the forum to your way of thinking. You are not here to enforce your warped standards on the forum, you should be here to engage in discussion with a like-minded community. However, since you are clearly unhappy with the community why don’t you leave and find a more high-brow forum</p>
<p>If you go into a bar and don’t like it, do you leave or go around calling everyone a retard until they ‘raise their standards’? And how long do you think it will be before somebody puts you on your arse outside the front door?</p>
<p>As far as I can see, not a single one of your posts has been constructive in any way, shape or form. Justify it as you may, you are a patronising elitist, a prime example of what seems to have been the consensus of a large number of posts here.</p>
<p>To the mods, I’m sorry for mentioning names and humbly beg forgiveness. But I completely fail to see why this member has not been banned for his behaviour and attitude.</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, its nice to see a topic where proper debate has taken place for several pages on topic  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

Shasta you are kind of a guy who would argue a mentally ill person to make him admit he’s crazy. I was going to post something much longer but I understood this is enough for you.<br>
For you if a person can’t speak English he is stupid. People in here are trying to speak your language but you don’t respect that right? You don’t respect anything. You tell people you are trying to teach them but only thing you do is flaming and insulting them. NOW! learn from me! People don’t need your judgement nor your punishment. Not Everybody is gifted with enough intelligence. This does not give you the right to insult them. WE are  here to have good time. Sometimes I do things i regret, too. But your posts are not funny nor they are educational. I’d post more but i won’t. because i know you are intelligent enough to understand me. and I don’t give a shit if i made mistakes in this posts. Because that’s my problem not yours.</p>
<p>Now don’t be a prick, learn and go. No one will judge you.</p>

</aside>
<p>Quite frankly, yes. That’s what banning is for, even if it’s only temporary; to be able to enforce a certain level of quality, since entropy pretty much leans towards things descending into shit if left unchecked. Go ahead and claim the “what makes YOUR opinion more valid than MINE?” angle, but what the hell makes YOUR opinion more valid? Banning may be a method to enforce my opinion on you, but you can already enforcing your opinion(that forums are shit and people should just put up with the shit on them) on others just by being an asshole and getting away with it.<br>
Forums are for discussing a subject and trying to have fun TOGETHER. There are other ways to have fun than just one person dumping their shit on someone else so that they can have fun at the expense of that person.</p>

<p>Like anyone, I respect your opinions and you are more than entitled to them. However, what I don’t agree with is your crusade to ‘educate’ every member of the forum to your way of thinking. You are not here to enforce your warped standards on the forum, you should be here to engage in discussion with a like-minded community. However, since you are clearly unhappy with the community why don’t you leave and find a more high-brow forum</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, its nice to see a topic where proper debate has taken place for several pages on topic  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>So it’s not OK for me to try and get people to use correct grammar, or to think things through before posting, but it IS OK for people to tell everyone to lower their standards? I can’t ask people to use their education, but others can demand everyone abandon theirs? Lovely.</p>
<p>And I didn’t say I was unhappy with the community here, I’m just pointing out the few trying to push low standards upon everyone else. If you make a mistake and are corrected by someone, try learning from the mistake and accept that you were wrong - don’t try and make everyone lower their standards or try to justify your mistake, “it’s just the internet, don’t be picky, etc etc”. If it’s not a big deal to you, then ignore it. I do agree with you however about this thread staying on topic and being debated. Good to see.</p>

<p>In my opinion, I do agree. It can be entertaining to sit back and watch (I’m sure a few of the guests are reading my post and thinking “Ooh! He’s gonna get it!”) But overall, you have to stand up for yourself, if you don’t, people walk all over you.</p>
<p>As I said, every one is mature or has an ego, the case with me is I have both. And I use one, the other, or both depending on the situation.</p>
<p>I’m a very flexible person and that’s how I make friends of all kinds, including egotistical jackasses like him. I know of at least one person who’s younger than I am and he’s very similar in how he acts.</p>
<p>To add on; I had to beat the respect he has for me into him.</p>
<p>It’s egotistical bastards like this that I don’t give two shits about things sometimes. And probably apart of the reason some people don’t post.</p>

<p>Back 2 topic; Some people don’t know the English language, actually it’s one of the hardest to learn as a 2nd language. And y’know I accept that, I know people of all kinds, some brits, some Canadians, most Americans.</p>
<p>You don’t be an ass hat about people’s race, gender, or where they’re from, or even their grammar, pick the shit together and interpolate the very bad grammar/spelling post as you would correctly and spit out the appropriate answer.</p>
<p>This would be what most of the people are asking for if I’m not wrong.</p>

          <p>I think it is what puts people off when coming to the forum, they click on a suggestion and then see how people flame the person. Sometimes it’s a perfectly acceptable suggestion but then people pick apart what he said because his grammar was a bit wrong or poor sentence structure or something else extremely pedantic.</p>
<p>Like I said I can understand why people can get so annoyed with this sort of thing, where there’s a person who goes as though this is an English lesson and everyone who makes a mistake is stupid.</p>
<p>edit: I also don’t see why, if you think someone is stupid you should get condescending and high and mighty, rather than flaming them for a stupid suggestion, some tolerance and simple explanations can go much further. eg. “[suggestion that has been asked before]” “hi, [answer], although it was in the faq which you should read [link]”.</p>
<p>Just having the forum as a more pleasant place will encourage posting, obviously joking is fine as long as it doesn’t get to “I’m better than you because my use of sentence structure and punctuation is far superior”</p>

<p>I’m sick of people demanding everyone else to lower their standards of grammar and intelligence to their low level of comprehension so that they fit in, and because it’s “just the internet”.</p>
<p>Not only that, but where does it end? Some people make an effort but get a few things wrong, some people go further and forego any punctuation, and others typ al thr stuf n txt. Where does it end? Just what level of laziness and stupidity is acceptable? Why is any of it acceptable? Is it really that hard to press a few extra keys, or are some people just that dumb? Why should everyone lower their standards to accommodate the retards?</p>

<p>It’s friendly argumentative skills like this that people should act like. I know you’re not trying to defend him (I think) but his points are meant to infuriate and start a flame war, not give a point on level ground with some one, he’s acting like a bully where as you are acting like an adult.</p>
<p>If he wants to bully, he’ll get bullied back in some cases, if he wants to be an asshole, he’ll get an asshole back. As the old saying goes: Treat them as you want to be treated.</p>
