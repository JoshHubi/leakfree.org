            <p>But yes, definitely see Falling Down if you get the chance. It’s hilarious and tragic and completely friggin’ awesome. Michael Douglas gives a commanding performance.</p>

            <p>Ah, yes. Falling Down almost makes up for Batman and Robin. Almost.</p>
<p>Also, I love all the fake drama the “news” outlets are cooking up over this. They took one quote from a blizzard employee and made it look like all out war, when actually another employee’s response was pretty much “Meh. We’re friends, I’m sure everything’s fine.” But no one is reporting that, of course.</p>

<p>The wait is only really worth it when it makes a better game; delaying some games because they aren’t ready <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> worth it (source: Starcraft II, etc.), just because the consequences of releasing unfinished games (source: KotOR 2) are horrible. A lack of progress because you suck (source: Duke Nukem Forever) isn’t a good excuse, because the end product wont be substantially better.</p>

<p>Yes I have to agree. WoW rocked the MMORPG market in the way only Blizzard can: Completely. I mean seriously, WoW was released in 2004, and almost seven years later still holds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-09-27-wow-has-54-percent-of-western-mmo-market" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">54% of the Western MMO market</a>, and that’s not even counting Asia. If you’re going to make an MMO, you might as well do it right, and Blizzard couldn’t be said to get a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> wrong.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t think there’s any need to defend Blizzard; they’re either the most, or at least one of, the best video game companies around. Their long-term support is almost unparalleled (source: Warcraft III got its last update in March <span class="bbcode-i">this</span> year, and Starcraft got one last year; that’s 10 years of support), and the quality of their games…well, that one goes without saying.</p>
<p>Plus, and perhaps more importantly: They support Mac, and have done for decades.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well yes, of course the Blizzard Community is made up of more than just modders. But firstly, a large part of the longevity of the game is derived from a game’s mod-ability (such as, for example, Warcraft III), so they’re hardly an insignificant subset. And secondly, my point was made in response to someone who said talked about the “disgusting Blizzard Community” who made DOTA, so obviously he was talking about the mod-centric aspect of it. While I may have talked generally in response to his odious remarks, there’s no sense including Starcraft players in a discussion about DOTA, since the two aren’t really related, even though they are broadly all part of the nebulous ‘Blizzard Community’.</p>
