    <title>iPod Touch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ipod-touch/3768</link>
    <description>I did something extraordinarily dumb a bit ago and I listened to Apple.  I updated my iPod Touch 3G ( 64GB ) from 3.1.2 to 3.1.3 and lost my JB.  I&#39;ve been scouring the Internet for a fix but it seems that any JBers won&#39;t release what they have until the iPad 3G comes out and I can&#39;t downgrade back to 3.1.2.

Does anyone know if it&#39;s possible at all to JB a 3rd gen. iPod Touch (version 3.1.3) by either doing a combination of JBing programs...or somehow restoring my iPod Touch back to 3.1.2?

As Apple is against JBing (hence my use of the acronym), if a mod wants to close this thread and/or delete it, feel free to do so.  I believe that if I own my iPod Touch, I should get to say what happens to it if it doesn&#39;t affect how I interact with Apple.  But, that&#39;s my opinion; feel free to delete/lock with my apologies.[/SIZE]</description>

            <p>Just an FYI. All “Jailbreaking” does is it allows a user to run unsigned code on the ipod.</p>
<p>Also another FYI. In the Cydia store, only available by Jailbreaking, there application that you can purchase. Even tho it exists, as hacking and Hombrew goes, the iPod scene is the least guilty of piracy.</p>

<p>Grow up please!<br>
Many people jailbreak their iPod Touches not because they want to download free games (which jailbreaking does not do it ALLOWS you to do, among many other things) it is to fully utilise it. Apple doesn’t let you use themes, bluetooth filesharing etc. so jailbreaking is a free, easy way of ‘freeing’ your iPod (‘jailbreaking’). Just because it CAN be used illegaly doesn’t mean it is. Please learn your facts before you tell people they are doing something illegal</p>

            <p>Quite informative discussion regarding to ipod going over here.I am really impressed and think that I can find solution of my question only over here.“I’m having issues with my mini ipod. When ever i try and transfer songs/update songs from itunes onto it - it will freeze. I’m currently using the latest version of itunes, is this version not compatable with mini pods?”</p>

            <p>Currently with 3rd generation iPod Touches you are unable to:<br>
a)Restore to 3.1.2 (Blocked by Apple)<br>
b)Jailbreak</p>
<p>Unfortunately I did the exact same thing so you’ll have to wait either for a jailbreak or new system software</p>
<p>Hope this helps!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I think I’ll just suck it up and wait for it to be released for 3.1.3.  From my research, once you get 3.1.3, you can’t downgrade back to 3.1.2.</p>
<p>But, thanks for the advice!</p>

<a href="https://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/</a></p>
<p>In the iPod Touch menu, select iPod Touch 3G 3.1.2 and download.</p>
<p>In iTunes, go to your ipod device page and ctrl+click on the button that says update or something. It’ll bring up a file browser, select the firmware that you downloaded and it’ll install it. You may have to restore your ipod to factory settings or something, but I doubt it. In any case you should probably back up your ipod just in case.</p>
<p>After that you should be able to jailbreak again.</p>
<p>On another note, that website is how I upgraded to 3.1 without paying. :pirate:</p>

<p>Jailbreakable - YES/NO</p>
<p>and listed exactly how to do so. I was trying to find that app, but I can’t  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  It would be better than that link, which I suspect to be un-useable  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>

<p>Not really, idling is only frowned upon because it annoys other people, if you idles in a game with just you in it then who would care?</p>

            <p>Your illegal efforts have been rendered useless due to a legal update from the manufacturer?</p>
<p>NO WAI!</p>
<p>You’re right when you said you’ve been incredibly dumb, and it’s not because you listened to Apple. It’s because you were dumb to update after aplying a JB.</p>

            <p>I’ve been jailbreaking for quite some time now, and as far as I know, it looks like you’ll have to wait. The iPod touch 3G is the only one you can’t do a jailbroken 3.1.3 restore to.</p>
<p>Bad luck :[</p>

            <p>I did something extraordinarily dumb a bit ago and I listened to Apple.  I updated my iPod Touch 3G ( 64GB ) from 3.1.2 to 3.1.3 and lost my JB.  I’ve been scouring the Internet for a fix but it seems that any JBers won’t release what they have until the iPad 3G comes out and I can’t downgrade back to 3.1.2.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if it’s possible at all to JB a 3rd gen. iPod Touch (version 3.1.3) by either doing a combination of JBing programs…or somehow restoring my iPod Touch back to 3.1.2?</p>
<p>As Apple is against JBing (hence my use of the acronym), if a mod wants to close this thread and/or delete it, feel free to do so.  I believe that if I own my iPod Touch, I should get to say what happens to it if it doesn’t affect how I interact with Apple.  But, that’s my opinion; feel free to delete/lock with my apologies.[/SIZE]</p>
