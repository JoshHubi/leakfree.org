    <title>Physics bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/physics-bug/10353</link>
    <description>Sooo, in the starting scene of the game, where that &quot;thingy&quot; is carrying you across Black Mesa facility I noticed something that might be a physics bug.
When you jump inside that thing (sorry, I don&#39;t know the exact term for it, someone?) you are stay in the same spot you were (in space) and don&#39;t move WITH it&#39;s constant velocity, therefore you end up going to the back of the vehicle.

I guess that you were supposed to stay in the same spot relative to the vehicle, because apparently it&#39;s not accelerating nor changing it&#39;s direction.
I think it has been noted already by many, but I haven&#39;t seen a thread about it.

Thanks  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Yes I distinctly remember this annoyance in HL1. HL2 and I believe Half-Life Source are without this. In Black Mesa Inbound it’s nothing more than an annoyance but in Blast Pit and On A Rail it can be cumbersome.</p>

<p>It is called a tram, and that is not a bug. True, you would stay in the same place relative to the tram instead of the world in real life, but I can imagine that would be rather difficult to achieve in a videogame.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t see what’s so hard about it.  Just add the initial velocity of the tram to the player’s horizontal velocity at the beginning of the jump.  I think Half Life 2 handles this correctly when you jump while riding on top of a train.</p>

            <p>Besides, you had the same effect in HL1. And it’s not really a bug.</p>
