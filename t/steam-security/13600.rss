<p>last I heard it doesn’t add ingame chat unless the game is available on Steam in the first place, and if you add a pirated non-steam game that also happens to be available to buy on Steam, it bans your account and worst of all, in-game chat doesn’t even work</p>

<p>I’ve been able to chat on Steam just fine playing EA Origin games through the Steam overlay.</p>
<p>What might happen is a conflict of overlays that makes you unable to open the Steam overlay but that can be solved by disabling Origin’s own overlay.</p>
<p>As for pirated games, I have done a few as Steam shortcuts and while indeed the overlay won’t work if they’re games that are also available on Steam, I’ve never been banned for playing them through there tho.</p>

            <p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-i">Guys, let’s try to keep things on topic.</span></p>
<p><span class="mention">@Half-Life</span> 3, you can install free-to-play games if you received them legitimately.  You can also install commercial games if you have received them legitimately.  You can have Steam load non-Steam games for you.</p>
<p>We cannot give you information on how to get games illegitimately.</p>
