    <title>A thought about progress updates</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-thought-about-progress-updates/6058</link>
    <description>If it&#39;s not possible for the devs to give us a release date or progress update, so be it.

The way it is now is that for us, the mod could be ready tomorrow, next week, next month, or 6 months from now, so we check back every day. Crazy theories arise and everyone checks everywhere for hints, and that&#39;s perfectly normal.

[b]So why not just tell us in what period we definitely DON&#39;T need to expect the mod to be released?[/b]

For example:
&quot;Guys, don&#39;t expect the mod to release in the following 6 months. That doesn&#39;t mean that after those 6 months it will be ready though, but at least you know you don&#39;t have to check here every day. After those 6 months we can tell you what&#39;s up then (perhaps the same)&quot;

After initial bitching and hating, it gets us off your backs for 6 months and we&#39;ll see then. Everyone happy. Nobody lied. No more crazy speculation till then.

Answer from developer CatzEyes (page 3; 24/12/2010):

Breaking news folks... 

[b]I am sorry but do not expect the game to come out within the next two months.[/b]

That is all. :wipes the tears from her eyes:

            <p>tl;dr</p>
<p>Are people still bitching about the mod not being released yet? Man, grow up already. What is with you who complain, thinking that the developers owe you something?</p>
<p>You complainers should be happy that they put ANY time and effort into making this (beautiful!) mod, instead of spending time with friends/family/partners, studying, partying, etc.</p>
<p>You know, one of these days the developers are just going to feel crap about all the complaints and bitching going on so that they decide that it’s not worth it, and stop working on the mod. Who is that helping, huh?</p>
<p>By the way developers, I really appreciate what you are doing and I hope that you can tune out all the bad people so that making the mod is actually fun. After all that’s why you are doing it, right?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>^ Well stated. As a mod developer myself I agree, the community is really writhing with pointless speculation. Personally, I liked the development blog that was kept for a fairly short time. It was a nice article format that had some interesting stuff about the inner workings of the mod. Personally I think it would be very informative if the devs would release a journal of what happens in development. As soon as I start making some good progress on my mod I’ll try to do that myself.</p>
<p>Originally I was attempting to do this article format called “Five at Five,” where every week at 5pm on a day of my choosing I would post five screenshots of my recent work with brief captions or any thoughts on development. (However, few people read the articles in question, and I soon had scarcely any time to work on the mod in question, let alone make my Five at Five deadlines) Considering the vast array of disciplines that Black Mesa incorporates into it’s development, such articles on the various technical aspects of the mod, such as working with AI in a level, optimization, unexpected glitches and how the team dealt with them, etc. could be an incredibly informative format.</p>
<p>It would satiate some of the fanboy demand as long as the articles are carefully worded- all talk of release dates would be thrown out the window- the articles would be focused solely on the technical aspects of making such an ambitious project. Personally I think that would make one hell of a monthly digest.</p>
<p>The issues with doing such a periodical are the hurdles of managing such a project alongside the current mod development, which could be unnecessarily difficult and place added stress on the development team. I think the way to alleviate that problem would be to using members that are not completing as many tasks to compile the information for the month in question and passing it to an in-house writer or a journalism outlet. That way the actual burden of writing the article is taken off the dev team and a minimum of time is wasted getting notes and screenshots published from the various departments.</p>
<p>Take these as the hair brained suggestions that they surely are, but I think it would be a worthwhile investment. Perhaps on a bimonthly schedule it would be even less stressful. Name it after the in-game newspaper, perhaps? But like I said, I don’t expect anything, I’m just putting this little idea out there. Feel free to use it how you wish.</p>

            <p>OMG GAIUZE! BALCK MEAS ISNT COMEING OUT IN THE NEXT TWO MONTH! THAT MEAN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS! IT’LL PROTBABBLY BE OUT TOMOROH!</p>
<p>It is my belief that someone, somewhere (possibly Fee) is honestly thinking this right now as it is written. With their poor excuse of a brain.</p>
<p>Sad, isn’t it? It doesn’t have to be. Only you can help prevent the tidal wave of stupidity that is pointless mod speculation. The forums can be a laughably ridiculous place sometimes. We’re here to help. Do your part by curb stomping the next person to whine about the lack of updates, complain that the mod is dead, etc. Join us in keeping some semblance of what passes for sanity here alive.</p>
<p><em>This Message Brought to You by The Agency of Crushing Baseless Speculation Ruthlessly</em><br>
“Keep it to yourself, twat”</p>
<p>To repeat what many before me have said, (including the main page), the mod will be released EVENTUALLY. Why do you need to be updated on it’s progress? What more do you really need? You’re free to check the website to see if it’s released as much as you like. Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly even! You’re allowed to do that! It seems to me that some people are under the impression that if they don’t see that it is released on the first day, that they will never get a chance to play it. Let me assure you that this is not the case. So what if you don’t know when it’s going to come out? You’ll end up playing it when it does. And as an added bonus, you’ll actually get to <em>gasp</em> see all of the things that they would have described in skimpy detail in twitter updates, youtube videos, and so forth. I’m not going to kid myself. I know all of this falls on blind eyes, and that idiots can’t be cured, but this is my bit: The mod is coming out. What’s the point of updates? You have a life outside of waiting for Black Mesa, even if it’s just a collection of other websites. Just do that until it materializes of of thin air like some majestic fucking unicorn.</p>

<p>Still, you had to had known that this would lead to speculations, exactly because you did <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> state what <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> going to happen. The only problem I see here, is if someone actually said “According to Catz the mod will be released in March (or in x months).”. All I see is speculation.</p>
<p>I get it, that the updates we get are small teases, and the devs don’t want to commit to a release date before being absolutely certain that they will want* to release the mod at that date. But then, why the serious attitude when speculation commences?</p>

<li>which means have it ready and feel satisfied enough with the outcome.</li>
