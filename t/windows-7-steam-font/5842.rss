    <title>Windows 7 Steam Font?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-7-steam-font/5842</link>
    <description>I just switched to Windows 7, and it&#39;s okay so far, but I&#39;m having problems with the font used in steam chats. The problem is, I don&#39;t like it. Actually worse, staring at it for too long makes me feel nauseous. People keep saying I should get used to it, but with me actually feeling sick looking at it, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen. I was wondering if there was any way to revert back to font XP used in Steam chat.

I liked the old one [i]much[/i] better than the new one. It was sharper, clearer, and better spaced out. The new one is kinda blurry and compacted, and makes me feel sick.  :sick: 

Comparison of the 2 fonts.

So I&#39;m asking, is there any way at all to revert to the old XP style Font?

            <p>I have a brand new Dell laptop with windows 7 and I don’t see this problem… maybe it’s your computer? My chat works fine, and I didn’t see a difference in the font at all. I didn’t see it in your pictures either. But that could just be me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I had a similiar problem with the entire of Windows after having reinstalled it a while back. Try changing the refresh rate of your screen down to 60, that was what fixed it for me.</p>

            <p>I have it disabled, because my fonts for websites were blurred too.</p>
<p>And if it is the same font, then it must be an optical illusion, but either way I don’t like it. I prefer the way it was; clear and sharp.</p>

<p>Actually, the fonts in those two screenshots are exactly the same.  Try overlaying the two "I thought"s in there, they match 100%.  The only thing that is different is that the system in the screenshot on the right has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_rasterization" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">font anti-aliasing</a> enabled.</p>
<p>I personally think the one on the right is much easier on the eyes, but if you disagree you might want to disable font smoothing in Windows 7.  I have no idea how to accomplish that, but Google can probably tell you. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
