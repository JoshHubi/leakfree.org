    <description>On the main site portal page it says: &quot;revist the world that started the Half-Life continuum&quot;

Was that word used because you thought it sounded cool or something? In context it seems a little out of place. &#39;Series&#39; or &#39;Saga&#39; would have done the job a little more accuratly I feel.

[i]con·tin·u·um  (kn-tny-m)
n. pl. con·tin·u·a (-tny-) or con·tin·u·ums
1. A continuous extent, succession, or whole, no part of which can be distinguished from neighboring parts except by arbitrary division[/i]

Given the fact Gordon Freeman is thrown into the mix after being absent a number years in Half-Life 2, I&#39;d hardly call it indistinguishable.

Yeah I know people  love words like this, (nearly as much as &#39;shadow&#39; and &#39;rise&#39; being overused in every title ever since 2000), but there is nothing wrong with being a bit clearer and simpler. *shrug*</description>

            <p>so we agree that continuum (two Us right? not unlike the Unununium element in the periodic table) is the right word then?</p>
<p>I don’t think you guys smashed it hard enough into metalmunki’s head.</p>
<p>then again the English language is funny in that a single word can be twisted into meaning basically anything.</p>
<p>no offense (also overused sentence btw)</p>

            <p>“Yo we maek this u play we smrt lol!!1!”</p>
<p>The Half Life universe is a continuum.  It’s just that you, as the main character, are only involved in portions.  You start on the tram (starting the Half Life continuum), you (eventually) push the crystal into the beam, bringing about the green apocalypse and you go and free the vortigaunts from slavery.  Afterwards, you’re not there for a while but Half Life continues.  The destruction of the Nihilanth brings about portal storms, the Combine invade, and, 7 hours later, Earth surrenders.  Black Mesa’s administrator heads to City 17 and becomes ruler of Earth and liaison between Earth and the Combine homeworld.  The world becomes a police state, and finally you decide to show up and cause chaos again.  Now you’re off to cause more unforeseen consequences!</p>
<p>I hope you’re happy.</p>

            <p>The Black Mesa frontpage isn’t talking about the game series though, they are talking about the fiction, history, “alternate universe,” if you will,  aka the “half-life continuum” (referring to continuity in the story). Its a fairly common usage of the word continuum in the context of fiction. It’s really funny that you are acting smug about this n_n<br>
edit: and its also fairly funny that you apparently registered an account just to post this</p>

<p>It’s not questionable at all that “continuum” fits, in fact it’s quite obvious.<br>
The two words you suggested, on the other hand, wouldn’t fit at all in that phrase, which makes me think you are commenting on something which is a little over your head, no offense.</p>

<p>Although, now that you mention it, I might change it to “revisit the <span class="bbcode-i">events</span> that started the Half-Life continuum.” Because if they want to use “world,” it should probably say something like “revisit the world where the Half-Life continuum originated.”</p>

<p>I wasn’t trying to sound smart by quoting the dictionary, I was just pointing out that it’s questionable that it fits. And why have a grey area when a much simpler word will do?
