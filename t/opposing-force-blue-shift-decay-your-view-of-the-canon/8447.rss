    <title>Opposing Force/Blue Shift/Decay: Your view of the caNon.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/opposing-force-blue-shift-decay-your-view-of-the-canon/8447</link>
    <description>So people I was wondering what everyone thought on Blue Shift, OP4 and Decay in regards to the Half-Life series as a whole. We all know it didn&#39;t factor into Valves plans and isn&#39;t &#39;officially&#39; canon, but what do YOU think?

Do you think they both try to add far too much that doesn&#39;t fit in your eyes?

Does it all fit in perfectly?

Do you want to see a return of the add-ons new elements? 

How so? In HL-3? Their own episodes? 

Do you not care?

Personally I&#39;ve always considered them to be canon, and see no reason why they couldn&#39;t be. I think it would actually bolster the depth of the Freeman story arc to consider these canon, and also give Valve more options to explore in the future, both in regards to story and gameplay.

CANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNON BALL! Had to.</description>

</aside>
<p>I am so sorry, for real. I thought the retarded kids reading comment was an insulting figure of speech. I had no idea you were talking about yourself. Lets see if i can explain in a way you will comprehend. When a writer, as in “a grownup who gets paid to write” says something like, “I don’t like that material that someone else wrote, so I won’t consider it when writing the story,” it is another way of saying “I won’t use the material.” In the case of something that has already been published, like OP4 or BS, if the head writer of the story says he will not even consider the material, he is definitely not going to go back to it in the story.<br>
Do you understand now?<br>
But hey, if they do resurrect some gearbox material, you can come in here and USE THE FORUM SEARCH FUNCTION to dig up this and all the other threads/posts where I pointed out that there will never be gearbox material in any future HL game and brag how you were right and I was wrong I will agree.</p>

<p>Yes, necro the old threads. that way, the  mods don’t have to merge new threads and lines of discussion can be preserved so threads like this one don’t happen. The forumites here will only pounce if the new addition is poorly thought out (like by rehashing old info because you didn’t search) or if it is irrelevant.</p>

<p>"hi, daniel, i won’t be able to clear up much. It was a deliberate decision to have gearbox never call him barney in blue shift, only calhoun. Raising the bar is not a game, so material is presented differently there; manifestations differ in every medium. Gearbox took our barney and did their own best version, but i’m not sure that barney is the same barney i’m picturing when i picture valve’s barney. In the time bs was created, there were many barneys. Only gradually have the redundant creature and character types slowly settled into iconic individuals…it’s an ongoing process. Gearbox did what was right for their games. Even though they had feedback and guidance from us, they didn’t always listen to it, and they steered by their own lights, etc., etc. I wasn’t very close to the creation of the expansion packs, and much more concerned with how to move the story forward and open up the universe; so i only take the games created by valve into consideration when i am working on the story…there are more than enough potential contradictions in our own designs without me worrying about contradictions in the inventions of other developers who were not part of our initial creative meetings. I know this is confusing to fans; it’s partly a byproduct of the way expansion packs were created, the way they were packaged and published, and also i was very new to this whole concept at the time. It never occurred to me that large chunks of the story would be taken out of our hands, changes made beyond our control, and then have the stuff handed back with some odd unexpected kinks in it. So try not to worry about it, and simply do my best with material directly in my control. However, as to your last question, there was pressure on us to set half-life 2 at black mesa, which a lot of us felt would be creative death; it was important to break new ground. Nuking black mesa was a good way to ensure that we had a way to avoid setting half-life 2 there. You might say i gave the g-man his orders. The whole issue of canon is something the fans came up with. I guess you will be able to identify as canon those story elements we continue to build on and develop and mention repeatedly as the story progresses. Others might fall by the wayside once they’ve served their purpose. Couldn’t you say the same of us all?<br>

<p><span class="mention">@Mephage</span>: That’s exactly what I found so interesting about it. You see the scenario from a guy just trying to survive. Not some guy trying to save the day. Which is a abit of an exageration, but in comparison their two perceptions are completely different. Which is why I wanted to take it away from Half-Life 2, and change the perception further. Have Shephard actually live through parts of the Xen infestation, 7 hour war, then the extinction itself.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Didn’t some bloke from Valve announce that everything in OPF and BS is canon unless it contradicts anything in Half-Life and Half-Life 2?</p>
<p>That they’re basically just comming up with a story as they go along, and nothing is written in stone unless it’s contradictory to the current story. That is, they retcon as they please, so canonicity is pretty difficult to pin down.</p>
<p>I however find both games to be canon. I didn’t like Race X, but I have no issues tolerating them as some third party that got involved by accident, I’ll buy that.</p>
<p>And regarding all the Shepherd fans and haters, I don’t see the big deal.</p>
<p>Same as Gordon Freeman. Shepherd is nothing but a regular guy put in a difficult situation, and gets through it. The military are always excluded from stories in any films or games, as if the average GI Joe serves no purpose other than being the bad guy or lying in a ditch covered in petrol on fire.<br>
So it was nice stepping into the shoes of someone who had an entierly different agenda in Half Life, but had to go through the exact same crap as everyone else there.<br>
Ultimately he’s a pointless character with no need for a separate storyline other than to show that there were in fact other people in the Black Mesa science facility that showed exceptional skill, and I think alot of people appreciate that you get to see a story being told that has no hero-value like Gordon Freemans.</p>
<p>Shepherd is just a regular bloke, and to include him in Half-Life 2 would most likely only serve as an easter egg. There’s really no story that can be told with Shepherd as the main character. He’s not a soldier anymore, he’s not a champion like Gordon Freeman, and he’s certainly not some secret weapon that G-man is going to use to take down Gordon Freeman.</p>
<p>I always imagined that if Shepherd makes an appearance in Half-Life 2, it would somehow be connected to the conclusion of G-man. Like losing control of all his time-displaced subjects, or finding out that he in fact stores them somewhere.<br>
Or perhaps even a crazy version of Shepherd that somehow managed to escape the grip of G-man and is now just trying to survive on his own, but with no specific story connected to him.<br>
Not giving Shepherd a story of his own, but rather concluding it and pointing at him and saying “There he is, he wasn’t forgotten about.”.<br>
But it’s close to impossible to try to implement him in the main story of Half-Life 2 without causing some major inconsistencies. He’s not a rebel, he’s not a hero, he’s not a combine, he does in fact have no place in Half-Life 2.</p>
<p>But I can’t argue that he at the time was an interesting character because he was a nobody. Nothing special about him, nothing unique about him. He was just a pair of eyes through which you saw the world from a different perspective.</p>

<p>Not the character, the rabid fans. Just look at all the shep speculation  when valve announced that a character from black mesa would make an appearance in episode 2.  “OMG IZ GUNNA BE ARIAN SHEEP HERDER” Then they were sorely let down when an all new character was introduced.</p>

<p>God damn. Why the fuck do you guys bother posting in threads you don’t like, simply to say you don’t like them? You’ve literally nothing better to do with your time?</p>

</aside>
<p>For those of us who have been here since '07, gone through  several forum crashes and repeatedly discussed the the concept of canon, including repeated postings of the Laidlaw vault, where he directly answers the question, the constant and repeated  threads of “despite what the writer of the story says, I really want things to be different,” are old and haggard, like a crack whore. If you like op4, or are a diehard shepfag, or somehow think that valve will revisit some blue shift secondary character,  that’s all fine, but it’s not going to happen. End of discussion. Period. So stop crying when someone poopoos your already run into the ground before you posted it thread, because yes, people have nothing better to do with their time than lurking on a web forum about a remake of a game that was released almost a decade and a half ago.</p>

            <p>Blue Shift and Decay was canon to me. Opposing Force would be considered canon , unless if theres some Black-Mesa themed level in HL2 EP3 , which I doubt there is.</p>

<p>To be honest, while I love Half-Life 2, I always thought it was a poor sequal to Half-Life. Honestly, I would’ve thought Half-Life 2 would’ve been something similiar to the first game, I imagined Gordon being in a city undergoing a huge Xen portal storm, with the city being invaded by the aliens, then the military comes back and tries to cover up the invasion the same way as they did in HL1. Then whatever ending that can be fit in that kind of scenerio. I always thought the survival/horror aspect of Half-Life to be much more interesting then the gothic/resistance aspect of Half-Life 2. But that’s just me.</p>
<p>As for whether or not the expansions are canon, I don’t think they are, I honestly never liked them, they’re just as canon to Half-Life as a regular mod would be.</p>

<p>One thing I don’t like with what has been said about Opposing Force being canon is the the destruction of Black Mesa. I really don’t see why Black Mesa being destroyed is so important that it had to be “canon”.</p>
<p>I would love to one day, in a potential future HL game, revisit Black Mesa. It has been deserted for a decade, a bit Portal 2-ish, with strange alien wildlife “growing” in it (Xen and Black Mesa merging organically). You could still recognize some of the iconic areas and play through them.</p>
<p>What if in Half-Life 3, you would have 2-3 chapters dedicated to returning to Black Mesa and retrieving the Xen crystal that caused the resonance cascade, or something like that. I know this won’t happen, but if I was Valve, I’d do it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . I’m already seeing the run-down, overgrown and corroded facility with new forms of alien wildlife inside. You’d make your way from one part towards the test chamber, going backwards relative to HL1. Of course, to make things interesting, equipment should still be functioning (such as elevators, doors, lights), which wouldn’t make much sense after that much time, but one sequence could be dedicated to restoring power to the facility or something…</p>
