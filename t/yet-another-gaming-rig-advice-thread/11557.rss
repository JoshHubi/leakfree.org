    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/yet-another-gaming-rig-advice-thread/11557</link>
    <description>Hello!

My current cheap-o custom built computer system:
32 bit motherboard + 32 bit Windows 7 OS
450PSU
AMD Athlon X2 3.2GHz CPU  (I think it is X2.. but google tells me this is 64 bit and idk because I am not near this rig atm)
Nvidia 220 GT GPU (1GB )
4 GBs (3.1GB 32bit) of RAM DDR3 
500GB Hard-drive 7200rpm(I think) - SATA
No rewritable drive.. to write disc&#39;s! This would be nice..

I was thinking, first I will buy a good gaming rig, then attempt to sell any un-useful (to me) hardware.

Budget £400-450!

I am thinking of getting 64 bit motherboard and 6-8GB RAM..

The thing is, iv&#39;e been playing a lot of DayZ recently, and I can only play on the lowest graphics setting. I think it is because of bad programming, and it doesn&#39;t use your RAM, but uses hard drive instead (which is much slower!). I would also like to be able to have reasonably high video settings for source games WITH very good performance. Maybe 400-450 is not enough, I do not mind making compromises.

I&#39;m thinking I need a more powerful PSU to be safe. Could I keep the CPU, would it be compatible with the new system.. I think I need a new GPU, a little better... 6 - 8GB RAM atleast DDR3 on a 64bit system. As for the hard-drive, I expect faster ones will cost a lot.. any ideas? Possibly a new chassis - mine is pretty crap (the bottom front fan is very loud and is breaking, this chassis is the oldest part of this computer).

tl;dr: Budget £400, Fast hard-drive atleast 500GB, 64 bit motherboard, good but cheap GPU better than NVIDIA GT 220. Cheap but well ventilated (good airflow) chassis. What PSU power do you recommend?

Thanks.</description>

Everything is around 300 £(plus shipping).I can’t recommend you good RAM and hard drive since I need to now details about your current ones(it’s speed)but I am pretty sure you can get both of them for 100-125 £ tops(I am thinking additional 8 GB of RAM and 1 TB hard drive)and with this you will be set for life.Now I see why no one else was replying to this thread.</p>

            <p>I get back to my main computer tomorow or late this evening.<br>
However, I think my motherboard is this little thing:<br>
ASUS M4A78LT-M LE</p>
<p>That is what google found and the specifications are right… however I did not realise it was a 64bit OS, so… I could just buy a 64bit OS… I will confirm if that is the motherboard tonight/tomorrow…</p>
<p>Alright, il buy the 520W PSU when I have decided on all the other hardware to get… if I need a new motherboard then im pretty stuffed right?</p>

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Would you think A NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 460 could cope well with the current, 450W PSU?<br>
Or would I need to upgrade the PSU?</p>
<p>There are two choice of GTX 460, one is £8 more than the other but… has HIGHER NUMBERS (It has been overclocked) xD</p>
<p>[b]Option A - 1GB EVGA GTX 460 FPB, 4008MHz GDDR5, GPU 823MHz, Shader Clock 1646MHz, 336 Cores, 2x Dual Link DVI-I/ mini HDMI</p>
<p>Option B - 1GB EVGA GTX 460 Superclocked, 4050MHz GDDR5, GPU 867MHz, Shader Clock 1734MHz, 336 Cores, 2x DL DVI-I/mini HDMI[/b]</p>
<p>again, I assume this would affect what PSU I need…<br>
I would also have to check if it would fit my tiny motherboard…</p>
<p>Either way, in the end im gonna have to go 64 bit so I can use more RAM, right?</p>

            <p>Your problem is not hard drive but your GPU and the fact that your OS is 32 bit so it can’t fully utilize those 4 GB of RAM.My current GPU Radeon 6770 1 GB DDR5 (which is considered to be a low-mid range card these days)is 3 times better than that 220 GT which I think tells you just how bad that card of yours is.I would strongly advise you to get Seasonic 520 W PSU which is not expensive and will provide opportunity to upgrade GPU some more in the future.</p>
