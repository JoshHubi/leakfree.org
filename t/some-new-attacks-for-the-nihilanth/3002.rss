    <title>Some new attacks for the Nihilanth?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-new-attacks-for-the-nihilanth/3002</link>
    <description>I think that the Nihilanth encounter in the original HL is a bit too simple. Ok, the Nih can teleport you and can launch electrical bolts, but it&#39;s too simple anyway!

The Alien Controller ([url]https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Alien_Controller[/url]) has a kind of attack the Nih has not: sometimes, the controller opens his head a shoot an orb to you. Why don&#39;t you give the nih a similar attack? In the moment that you crack its head open, it will make an orb that does something (AoE attack? electrical charge? destroy/disable your equipped weapon? shoots randomly in your direction? anything!)

That makes the encounter a little more complicated in the moment it needs something to maintain the climax. What do you think?</description>

            <p>Is this okay?</p>
<p>Maybe after destroying the crystal, and Nihilanth is half HP, vorts will come simultaneously to heal Nihilanth. If you kill one vort it will be replaced immediately. The Vortigaunts (+controllers maybe) will attack Gordon while Nihilanth is resting. When the vortigaunts are dead, Round 2 will begin. When the brain is exposed, Nihilanth will use something (kinetic powers?) that sends you away when you’re to close when using the trampoline-things or like an  alien airpad. When Nihilanth is now dying, a portal storm effect will start (like in portal but mixed with the resonance cascade beams) then the gman stops time (like HL2) then teleports with you to the Endgame Stage.</p>

<p>I think that the nature of the Nihilanth’s teleportation attack <span class="bbcode-i">definitely</span> needs revision.  In the original game, the amount of time and effort it always took to get back from the teleported locations caused me to treat them as insta-kills, and whenever I was hit by a teleport sphere, I always hit the quick-load key.  Either the locations the Nihilanth teleports you to need to be somewhere necessary for progression of the battle, the teleport spheres need to be non-dodge-able and inevitable, or the teleport attack needs to be replaced with something else.</p>

</aside>
<p>This.  Those were more irritating than the orbs he throws at you.  By inevitable and non-dodge-able, I presume you mean the teleports are scripted and occur only when they’re supposed to?  I’d like that.</p>
<p>And I think the Garg and Ichy need to go.  It’s really unnecessary and irritating to have to fight around other bosses while fighting another boss.  Same goes for the other aliens in the fight.  When I’m in boss mode, I don’t need a bunch of Vorts and Controllers hovering around me.</p>

            <p>What if something was to limit cover? You go to a spot and stay for awhile then Nihilanth brings some rocks down on you in which you have to dodge? Simple stuff… I dont see why we are really talking about it the devs no what to do and if they didnt think they did a good job they would revise.</p>

            <p>I think it should maintain a calm&amp;coldblood-line of a villain character. I mean, not exaggeratedly angry and over-combative, more calculated and powerful. Maybe more talking to scare off the player as he approaches, like if he’s an evil genious. He’s supposed to be the… big head (lol) behind all the alien forces, afterall.</p>

<p>I thought I saw a Mark Laidlaw quote saying somethign along the lines of Nihilanth didn’t care about Earth, it was just one step further from the Combine.  When the resonance cascade happened, he saw an opportunity and took it.</p>
<p>No ill will towards humanity, but no compassion, either.  He’s just doing what it takes to survive and flee the Combine.</p>

<p>I think these are the quotes you mean:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Marc Laidlaw">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Marc Laidlaw:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a glimpse of the larger threat when we were working on Half Life 1. In other words we knew that once you cleared out the nihilanth, you were going to discover something worse beyond it. We knew that some immense threat had chased the Nihilanth and its creatures out of their own world and into Xen, from which location they were all to glad to seize the opportunity to continue on to earth with suppression through the citadels. But the exact nature of the threat was left to be solved in Half Life 2.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Marc Laidlaw">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Marc Laidlaw:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, that’s fairly accurate, and I’m pretty sure Doug was restating something I’d told him; I am not clarifying it, since it’s the foundation on which the series continues. What we saw in HL 1 was the very end of a long struggle between the Combine and the last of the Nihilanth’s race…although it’s a bit different than the word “prompted” implies. The Nihilanth’s “world” (if it could be said to have) was long since in the past as far as the Nihilanth was concerned; Xen was their final retreat, and they had their back to the wall, as it were, when the fissure appeared that let them spill into our dimension. Xen itself is sort of a dimensional transit bottleneck–an area of continual contention.</p>

            <p>I know you’ve apologized but I would like to say this anyway…</p>
<p>Grammar errors may ocurr since I never took a single english class in my life…<br>
(and english is not my primary language)</p>
<p>Other than that this is the second time I registered in this forum</p>
<p>My HL knowledge is not the best but i’ve played all the games at least twice and also readed/watched videos about “the hidden stuff”… (The same aplyes to Portal 1/2 and HL1 expansions…)</p>
<p>Let’s face it, no one really knows what Nihillant really is, neither anyone knows about the combine that much… Everything we have as true may be wrong, only Valve knows…</p>
<p>What I was trying to say, is that , there must be a reason why one of his main attacks was a teleporter attack… And I think he did not wanted to fight… There was a discussion going on about, whether or not he should be more agressive and more of a challenge or not, and my vote goes for “not much of an agressive guy…”</p>
<p>But don’t worry I wont be participating in the forums as much as anyone else…</p>

<p>I dunno if anyone said something like that before but…</p>
<p>Well in my point of view, Nihillant doesn’t want to fight with gordon because altough he is powerfull he’s not strong enough to fight with gordon.He knows the consequences of losing this fight, Gordon doesn’t. The reason why Nihillant keeps teleporting Gordon is because he does not want this fight to happen. Nihilant is the only thing between G-Man,the Combine and the future damnation of everything.<br>
I just really want you guys to keep what Nihillant says to gordon when he dies, that’s some important stuff…<br>
Also the fight must be something like “Im not your enemy you pathetic fool”…</p>

<p>EDIT: Just checked your posting history. So sorry, I’ve gotten you mixed up with the waves and waves of other new people and overracted. The mis-directed parts of the original post is viewable if you highlight/select it.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Black’]Sir and or Ma’am. I want you to take a step back here. I know you are very eager about the mod, we all are, but you can’t step blindingly into stuff.</p>
<p>I used to be like you and I made some similarly bad and silly posts when I first came here. Your problem is that what you are suggesting (aside from any spelling and grammar mistakes it may have) is unreasonable. What you said does not fit or add up.</p>
<p>A word of advice: Don’t post if someone has said exactly what you have said unless you have something to add. I would also <span class="bbcode-b">heavily reccomend that you have played through Half-Life and Half-Life 2 or atleast have watched a play-through of it</span>.</p>
<p>Of course this isn’t directed only at this post of yours but some of your previous posts of yours aswell (unless I am confusing you with the other slew of new members).</p>
<p>I do understand your general idea though. You want the Ninilanth to show more signs of the consequences faced if he is killed. Unfortunately this is untrue. The Ninilanth is a slave-worker, effectively, and the Combine only become aware of something to conquer because of how “noisy” the space-stuff incident in Black Mesa was.</p>

            <p>I think that Nihilanth would be voiced by Kevin Sisk (heavily modified), if Nihilanth speaks at all…which I think he should.  EDIT: I didn’t read the voice acting page.  My apologies, folks.</p>
