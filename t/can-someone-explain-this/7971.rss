    <title>Can someone explain this?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/can-someone-explain-this/7971</link>
    <description>I created a folder on my desktop (on the leftmost monitor) and named it &#39;Flash&#39;.

As soon as I pressed Enter it&#39;s name changed to &#39;Flash (1)&#39; and then all my game icons and Chrome icon on the middle monitor instantly tiled onto my left monitor and all their names changed to &#39;Flash (2)&#39;, &#39;Flash (3)&#39; etc.

Never seen anything like it. I was running an eyefinity desktop at the time. I didn&#39;t have any other shortcuts named &#39;Flash&#39; before doing this. All my shortcuts (including games) on the left and right monitors remained unscathed as did the shortcuts to drives, folders, documents etc. that were on the middle monitor.

Well, back to renaming them.

Any thoughts? If you think specs will help you solve this riddle I&#39;ll give them to you. But I bet no-one has seen something like that before.</description>

            <p>Sorry i can’t help it, but don’t you people have anything todo, but trashing peoples threads?</p>
<p>TO OP: I guess you are running Windows 7?<br>
It’s a known bug.<br>
There is a lot of bugs in win7 explorer.</p>
<p>You will also often see some random files selected on the desktop after deleting a single file.</p>
<p>But when/if it happens again, just press CTRL+Z (it will undo the renaming)</p>

<p>Nice work! I must’ve retartedly mashed the Shift key or selected multiple files some other way before renaming.</p>
<p>But - how did I make all the icons tile to the left side after pressing Enter?</p>
