            <p>GMO crops combined with population growth control are the solution for global scale hunger.</p>
<p>The whole bullshit about affecting our DNA is… well, bullshit. All we do when we alter the DNA of those plants is basically the same as evolution has done in all these years: causing mutations in their genes. We just took out the random factor to speed up the process and achieve specific goals. Just to consider the fact that something that happens naturally will somehow affect our cells just because we made it happen instead of nature is just retarded.</p>
<p>And it’s not like we haven’t been doing it in the past centuries either; and not just with plants. Just because we haven’t taken their genetic code and manually altered it, doesn’t mean we haven’t been manipulating their characteristics. We have been doing it since we ascended as a rational species, and not just with plants. The variety of dog breeds, for example, is just the result of a slow process of oriented reproduction that goes way back to the past millennium, used to manipulate certain aspects of a dog individual, be them physical, behavioral or whatever else needed.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Burbinator</span></p>
<p>Essentially what we’re doing is creating variety. Not natural, but artificial, but it’s still variety  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> . We wouldn’t be doing any more harm than we are today (most likely less); because the use of pesticides and chemical additives is responsible for a good bunch of the environmental chaos we’ve caused in the past centuries. Using GMO seeds is a much less impactful way of maintaining crops alive as far as hurting the environment goes, and also is a much more efficient way of increasing productivity.</p>
<p>And agriculture itself is already an activity that promotes reducing natural variety. It’s essence is basically “remove local ecosystem and replace it with countless individuals of desired species, and keep them alive by killing those who feed of it”. That’s a process that, no matter how you do it, will eliminate a local ecosystem and replace it with a man-made artificial system, breaking the food chain and disturbing the natural balance.</p>

            <p>Its impossible, now. Because farmers have been driven toward bigger and bigger yields, there is now a deep dependence on pesticides, fertilizer and modified crops.</p>
<p>If a farmer stopped using these, he and his family would go bankrupt.</p>
<p>That’s a sad story, but its not his or the corporations fault for developing said situation. Its our fault. We consume a shit ton of food, and someone needs to grow it. It just so happens that there are too many people and not enough natural resources.</p>
<p>Eventually (and especially with climate change) the breadbasket of the United States will fail. We feed our crops with oil, and that shit is going to run out and we all know it.</p>
<p>Fortunately or unfortunately, it can really be defined in terms of good or bad, one solution to this problem is to engineer new forms of life.</p>
<p>I actually respect this idea, because it shows me that we are maturing as a species. I can understand how the lamen would react though, because the lamen would generally know very little about how genetics work.</p>
<p>The news likes to sensationalize about a ‘fish gene’ being inserted into a potato, as if the potato will grow fins and scales.</p>
<p>We are all made of the same stuff. Sometimes the code for one type of stuff helps another type of stuff do better in certain conditions. Over millions of years, the potato might have eventually evolved a gene that functions similarly to the fish gene if it needed to. We just sped up the process.</p>
<p>And FYI, there is no such thing as ‘natural’ anymore. That is if you define ‘natural’ as something untouched by humanity. Everything on this planet has been touched by us, some things more than others. You think that organic apple you are eating is “natural”? Even 100 years ago, it was still twice as large or more as a wild apple. Its too late to go back, now. The only thing we can do is look to the challenges ahead and do our best.</p>

            <p>I thought farmers would want to try to sustain soil for as long as possible to reduce the necessity for crop rotation.</p>

            <p>GMOs, as far as I know, can be very harmful to the environment.</p>
<p>They allow farmers to kill <span class="bbcode-i">everything</span> except what they want to live, thus destroying natural variety in the ecosystem.<br>
Which is also a good way to deplete the soil, as normally there are plants and bugs that make sure the soil stays fertile.</p>
<p>I think, anyway, I’m not sure.</p>

            <p>GMO aren’t food additive, it’s adding differents genes to a plant (from other ones) in order to resist chemical weedkillers, insects, lower fertilizer use or enhance productivity. Taste is basically the same.<br>
The only debate is if by messing with DNA, this could prove to be harmfull to food safety.</p>
<p>Ohh, and did I mention that GMO are like condoms. You can’t use them twice so you have to buy each year the seed…</p>

<p>Don’t really have one, to be honest, except that it’s not the latter.  That was Julius Caesar.  :3</p>
