    <title>Custom Model Replacements</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/custom-model-replacements/4099</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m replacing models for the old Half-Life 1, right? Well, in Half-Life one, when I add all the required files in their appropriate folders (steamapps/half-life/valve/models and steamapps/half-life/valve/sounds/weapons) I can only replace the sounds. Also, when I replaced weapons in the folder for the mod Azure Sheep, only the world-models and sounds changed, the view-models stayed the same. I&#39;ve thought that the .gcf file for Half-Life overrides any folder-based files. So, help please.  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>This is why i dont like modding with steam, modding with an Original half life generation pack disc was easier when it was installed under sierra files and such, manipulation of the game was alot easier. cooler setup aswell tbh. :freeman:</p>

            <p>You seem to be doing it right. I know for a fact that the steam version of BS will only accept sounds, but that’s not it.</p>
