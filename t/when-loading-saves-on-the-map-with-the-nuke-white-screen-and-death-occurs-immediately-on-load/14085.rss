    <title>When loading saves on the map with the nuke, white screen and death occurs immediately on load.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/when-loading-saves-on-the-map-with-the-nuke-white-screen-and-death-occurs-immediately-on-load/14085</link>
    <description>I got inside the building with the nuke last night. Now this morning, all of my 3 saves that exist on that map (even the save 6 minutes before, well outside of the building) load to an immediate white explosion and death.
None of my saves are under 1MB even when zipped individually, so I just put them in a 7zip and changed the file extension to .zip ([b]so change this back to .7z[/b]). Not sure if I should be doing that, but I can&#39;t find another way unless I upload externally. You should definitely allow 7zip as it makes it much easier.

Hope this helps with solving the issue. Thanks.</description>
