    <title>TV going trough wall and moving track bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tv-going-trough-wall-and-moving-track-bug/10006</link>
    <description>So when i stand onto those moving tracks in this chapter Residue processing the moving tracks go faster than me.
when i look down i can see the texture moving faster.
Also in chapter &quot;Questionable ethics&quot; if i hold LMB onto those TVs on the wall and start hitting them with crowbar they go trough the wall.
Also game freezes after going to windows(ALT + TAB or windows button)</description>
