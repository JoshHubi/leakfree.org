    <description>Im going to be building my first computer here shortly, and im not the most hardware savvy guy on the planet. I know what im looking for as far as gpu/ram/power supply/hdd, but what i need help with is choosing a good mobo cpu combo. This build is going to take a while, and im not going to have enough to build a top of the line rig, i just want one that is [u]decent.[/u] Right now im running off a complete factory setup, minus the gpu(Radeon HD 5830) and the power supply(Rosewill 630W). The only thing i have decided that i am going to get is a 6870, but that isnt set in stone either. Keep in mind im trying to stay low in price, but all suggestions are welcome. If there is anything cheaper than what i want that you would suggest for a decent gaming rig, feel free to tell me.</description>

            <p>Sorry for the late reply. Awesome info… I think I’ve decided on what to buy.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
The black mesa forums is dependable when it comes to these stuff.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me the difference, positives, negatives of i3 and i5?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Both i3 and i5 are near the top end of the Intel desktop cpus. Technically i7 2600k is the best of the bunch (not counting the insane &lt;$1000 i7 980X) but you probably won’t need an i7 unless you are using a lot of cpu intensive programs. I just upgraded my cpu from AMD 64 X2 to Intel i5 2500k, but I only chose the second best because I wanted to emulate games on PCSX2 and Dolphin emulator, so that might be unnecessary for your needs. Are you asking about i3 560 and i5 2500k or what? There are sub-models of these things.</p>
<p>In terms of general differences, as the name implies, i3 is slower than i5. i5 is probably not necessary for general gaming, but if you can spare the money I’d recommend it, it works great. I believe the extra k on the end of the i5 2500k and i7 2600k is there to indicate that they can be overclocked. This means you can’t change the clock speed of any i3 model, the i5 <span class="bbcode-b">2500</span>, and the i7 <span class="bbcode-b">2600</span>. Once again, not needed, but a welcome addition. Basically, if you want a mid high range cpu and don’t care about changing the clock speed, get i3. If you want a high range cpu get the i5 2500k (the extra few bucks for the k pays off). Only get an i7 if you are using a lot of programs that use large amounts of cpu power like Photoshop or a browser full of tabs simultaneously.</p>
<p>PS: Watch out about the motherboard you get for these CPU’s only certain models allow you to OC the k series’ or use the onboard iGPU for video encoding. I recommend the P8P67 motherboard unless you’re sure you’re going to need to use the extra proccesing of the iGPU. Otherwise get the P8Z68, both the motherboards come with a kickass UEFI bios, which makes OCing much easier and easier on the eyes.</p>
<p>PPS:Look up the details on sites like Anandtech or Tom’s Hardware, and research exactly what you’re buying before checking out. For example, my PS/2 keyboard doesn’t work with my new computer. So triple check everything before buying.</p>
<p>Edit: PPPS: Unrelated, but ironically since I spent all my money on my new rig, I can’t afford Skyrim now. :freeman:</p>

            <p>Since this mainly discuss about building a PC…</p>
<p>I’m not making a new thread…</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me the difference, positives, negatives of i3 and i5?<br>
I googled it and… I just couldn’t find the answer I’m looking for…<br>
I’m about to buy a new computer this X-mas.</p>

            <p>I wound up going with an i5 2500k / Asus P8P67 PRO combo.  If you’re looking to save money, I think AMD makes slightly less expensive processors, though I know nothing about it; I’ve always (read: three computers) used Intel.</p>
