    <description>So when I get back into the lobby and kill all the soldiers, the scientists and guarrd comes out. when they get to the exit 1 scientists opens the door the scanner comes online then pops, the other male scientists who goes in with me :freeman: just stands there and the door to go outside stays closed. I&#39;ve tried everything, even double checked the area for soldiers. Anyway to troubleshoot? (note: had cosole commands on such as god and impulse.) Pretty infuriated now. :rage:</description>

            <p>I got this during testing and it bugged me to no end as well. Till I realized they didnt like it when I went hunting around the room for stuff while ignoring them while they talked. You will want to redo that part where the scientists are talking to you and be sure to follow them into the room with the scanner rather than walk around the lobby playing with things in the room. The scientist is supposed to scanner for you and it should open the door to the outside.</p>
