    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/questionable-ethics-bug/10312</link>
    <description>Hi guys.

In &quot;Questionable Ethics&quot; chapter I meet the three scientist (two old guys and a lady). After I stop the machine with saws, the scientist start to follow me. When we reach the closed door, one of the guys open the door for me to enter. After I enter the large room, the door closed itself and a bunch of soldiers attack me. After I kill them all, the door (the one that the scientist opened for me a few seconds ago) now not open and I am stuck. :fffuuu: I tried again and again, but after I kill the soldiers, the door not open itself. I need the scientist to do some retinal scaning, so I can move through, but they are stuck behind the door...:[ Any ideas?

ps: pls excuse me for my bad english.
ps2: save file on the same level with open door will do the work for me. :wink:</description>

<p>OP:  Did you ever get past this level?</p>
<p>I’m having the same problem.</p>
<p>I’ve killed off the soldiers four times now, each time reloading from the autosave when the scientist opens the blast door and lets me in.</p>
<p>Once I kill all the soldiers nothing happens.</p>
<p>I’ve taken out the ones still standing on the roof, I’ve even thrown grenades upstairs just in case there was someone hiding up there, but nothing.  The level never ends.</p>
<p>Just me and a bunch of dead soldiers chilling at the end. Rather disappointing.</p>
<p>Worth noting, There is a dead soldiers body in the same spot right near the railing every time, which I never killed.  Could this body have something to do with it?</p>
<p>Any help appreciated…</p>

            <p>Apart from a bug (that didn’t happen to me), the most probable solution is that you didn’t kill the soldiers on the roof/glass. The scientists come out only after <span class="bbcode-i">every</span> soldier is killed. Snipe 'em with the crossbow.</p>
<p>EDIT: didn’t read the comment…</p>

            <p>I have tried a dozen more times, I killed every single one of the soldiers, but this fu<em>king door don’t open itself… Well, after all I decided to load one of my “manual” saved games. Unfortunately the last time I saved was on the level with the rail cart. So I started to play and everything was OK until I go to the place, where Freeman must plug the cable (one that is in some electrified flooded area). I pluged the cable, I lowered the platform, I killed the aliens that teleported in the area, and the next thing that I need to do is to open the big metal door. OK, but to do that, I must enter in the near control room. Well, guess what - the fu</em>king door which lead to the fu*king control room DON’T OPEN ITSELF!!! :3 :zip: And I don’t have any other saved games. I think I’m going to shoot myself… :meh:</p>

            <p>I’ve got the same problem, and no idea how to trigger the opening. Is it a bug or just not waiting long enough?</p>
