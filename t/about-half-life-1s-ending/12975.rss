    <title>About Half-Life 1&#39;s Ending</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/about-half-life-1s-ending/12975</link>
    <description>Hi guys,
I just finished Half-Life 1 and what a beautiful and amazing game that was. The thing is I have questions about the ending. First of all I chose not to work with the GMan and eventually found myself in hundreds of aliens and credits afterwards. However after the credits ended there was this black screen and I actually waited looking at that black screen for like 20 mins because I thought the game didn&#39;t really ended. Interestingly the icons of the ammo and health and stuff was still on the screen and actually when I push jump button there was the hitting-to-floor noise like you are still in the game. So what actually happened? Did Freeman died or what? Did I miss something? And what would have happened if I accepted Gman&#39;s offer?

Thanks  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Yes, it’s possible that, if you refuse G-Man’s offer, he teleports you to the agrunt room and then puts you into stasis before they can attack you, to show you that you really didn’t have any choice in the matter.  Either do what G-Man says or… well…</p>

            <p>I don’t think that’s what he was asking.<br>
Your game glitched out, it was supposed to end after the credits. In that (non-canon) ending; Yes, Freeman dies (or it’s implied, anyway. Unarmed Freeman vs. dozens/hundreds of agrunts? Psh.).</p>
<p>If you were to accept the offer, you’d just get a black screen w/ a few more G-man words and go to credits. Story-wise Freeman is put into stasis roughly 2 decades, which then resumes with Half-Life 2.</p>

            <p>IOW, the choice is an illusion since there’s only one “real” option, which is to work for G-Man, since the alternative is death by those alien grunts. Although, it could be argued that if you really, deeply objected to G-Man’s offer, death would be a real option as well. In any case, Half-Life 2 naturally assumes you took his offer and kept living to fight another day, so that is the “correct” option.</p>
