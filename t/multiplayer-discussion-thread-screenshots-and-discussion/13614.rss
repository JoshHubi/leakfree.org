    <description>Welcome to Black Mesa&#39;s Work in Progress Multiplayer thread! (Or BMSWiPMPT, if you prefer catchy names).

In this thread, we will endeavour to be a bit more open with you guys about the development of Black Mesa&#39;s multiplayer component. Currently, in terms of multiplayer, the team&#39;s focus is on Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, but there will be a lot more to come.

As we work towards the Steam release we hope to show you guys more and more of our hard work. This thread is where we will post screenshots, videos, ideas, and features, for you guys to discuss, comment on, and give feedback. We&#39;re all extremely excited to finally start sharing some things with you guys. Feel free to ask questions and post your thoughts, we will try our best to engage with you and be honest and direct.

Here&#39;s what this thread IS NOT. It is not a place to ask about Xen, singleplayer, Oculus Rift, or ANYTHING ELSE Black Mesa related. There are also NOT official media releases. This thread is strictly for multiplayer. Derailing or off topic posting will be punished. Stick to the topic at hand, and we&#39;ll all have a lovely time. Also remember, this stuff is all work in progress. Don&#39;t be a jerk.

=================================================

To start off with, here are some screenshots of the current state of Gasworks and Stalkyard. Discuss, or ask general MP questions.

<p>Do you know how to make a bunny hopping command? I don’t. I can promise you that making something a convar is a lot more complicated than it might seem. We don’t have a lot of programming resources, and their plate is completely full. And that’s assuming that we a) are able and b) are willing to figure out how to make bunny hopping work, despite whatever Valve did to make it not work on the engine. How much work is that? I don’t know, but it’s more than zero, and possibly quite a lot. That’s a lot of work for a feature we don’t want to support by default, and that only a very small subset of the population will care about.</p>
<p>I’m not ruling it out, but I certainly wouldn’t expect it. None of us like bunny hopping by design anyway, even if players have found cool ways to use it and increase the skill gap. Mostly because it is a glitch and a flaw in the physics system. That’s not to say we hate all instances where stuff like that happens. My favourite example is trichording from Descent, which was also technically a physics bug in the engine - but something I loved a lot and thought really added to the experience in a positive way. The difference is - trichording makes logical sense when you think about it. Bunnyhopping? Counterintuitive and nonsensical.</p>
<p>I’m not here to ague about the merits of bunnyhopping, at any rate, which I’m sure we could do all day. Just the implementation aspect, which probably won’t happen.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And this is why MP in this game is already dead. Why even bother if you’re unwilling to dedicate the resources to make it worth playing? Casual players won’t care about this, because as-is, it’s basically a less polished COD with HL weapons. Might be fun for a few matches after you first install but nobody is coming back to play this game. The people who would’ve played your game for yrs to come won’t care because the movement sucks. There’s nothing unique to draw anyone in; it’s just another slow paced shooter.</p>

<p>I think for the non competitive gamemodes, our stock maps could work really well with an asymmetrical (one sided) CTF, similar to Halo. 4 rounds, the teams alternate attacking and defending. I’d definitely like to give that a go as a gametype at some point if possible.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>heh i just had a funny idea regarding crossfiresbunkers for CTF my thought is modify the  buildings section of the map to include a route to another airfieled and instead of nuking the entire map it would just bomb the air field it would also have a couple ways to break into the bunker via satchels and Various  explosive apparatus so that even when the bunkers are sealed there are alternate routes in and out so trolls cant keep thier team locked in/enimes out or perhaps a veersion of WGH that has two security rooms and silo doors and you have to open up the silo to get the flag i certainly hope CTF gets added since it will be rather interestingto play around with current map sources</p>

<p>also can you even perform the dark arks on pinned thread?</p>
<p>Random thought of the day from june why cant we have a inspect weapon animations button for MP just for the people who want to make the shotgun cock in a very awesome manner</p>

            <p>I hope this doesn’t count as necroing (considering that this is a pinned thread) but I just want to leave this here a year later just so whenever/if ever post-xen multiplayer becomes a focus again that there definitely still is an interest for a female scientist voice for the HEV suit!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I believe the current HEV suit just uses the already existing male scientist voice lines so I think adding the female ones wouldn’t hopefully be too taxing maybe? I recall a <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28283-Why-not-Female-HEV-deathmatch-model/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">similar thread</a> like this a while back.</p>
<p>On the topic of playermodels; are the Half-Life Deathmatch models ever planned to be added? Such as Barney, Gordon, Gina, etc;?</p>

            <p>We’ve mostly done what we can for MP, for now. We plan on doing much more on it once Xen is out, which we think will bolster the population significantly and allow us to allocate way, way more resources towards actually doing what we want with it. But, right now, Xen is our total priority, much as it hurts for some of us (I love our MP and was one of the team’s most passionate members about it).</p>

            <p>Will we ever be to choose a female voice for the HEV suit? It seems like it’s supposed to be pretty gender neutral (as is the suit in the games) so it’s kind of awkward hearing the male scientist voice in it and not being able to change it.</p>

            <p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/1197-darkone/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@darkone</a> There is absolutely no need for a burstfire M16. You basicly have burstfire on primary fire shotgun (precise but weaker than secondary fire). If you’d like to shoot on long range you can also use the 357 or Crossbow. Personally I think the devs should not add any more weapons to the game, because we have most shooting-mechanics in the game already. Also I don’t have any keys left on my keyboard to use as weapon bindings. Sure the game misses some projectile weapons like HL2-style crossbow (maybe they could drasticly decrease BM primary crossbowbolt splash range and damage, but make them deal much more damage on direct hits) or Quake 4-style plasmagun (with some changes, the hornetgun secondary firemode could be used like that: maybe increase ammolimit to 16… then primary fire could use 2 ammo per shot and secondary fire could be more usefull for spaming narrow corridors. Also make beegun secondary fire shoot a straight or slightly randomized line. Additionally it would be cool if secondary fire bees would find their targets on their own as soon as they get very close [maybe 16 unit ‘magnet’-radius] to them). <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/610-danielsangeo/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@danielsangeo</a> sorry. It just makes me way too mad when people keep suggesting extreme gameplay changes, which would fundamentally change how the game is played. HL’s main competetive modes were 3v3 to 5v5 traditional TDM and Duel. Introducing weaponloadouts, lower pickup-respawn times, lower charger charge-times, spawnprotection or anything like that make these gamemodes a lot less skill-based and less competetive. That’s why I am strictly against any changes regarding these traditional competetive gamemodes. I don’t mind having additional gamemodes or server options as long as the main emphasis is on the main competetive gamemodes.</p>

<p>Multiplayer games with super strong weapons destroying players in just one or two hits always have these issues that one skilled gamer with no life will rule the game. I think one way to solve this would be to enable something like different weapon modes, like tau/gluon-only rounds, rounds with explosive weapons or rounds with only mp5/shotgun/pistol/magnum.<br>
To be honest, I had the most fun on a small map with tau weapons only which were picked up right away.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, that’s not good for n00bs, because they won’t learn the game that way. People should accept what Half-Life is and what it does offer instead of just playing it casually. Half-Life is a game with learning curve and it requires dedication. It really hurts to always read stupid comments like yours… And yes, in Adrenaline Gamer there were gamemodes like arena or arcade which let you spawn with all weapons. It’s OK if you want to play a casual gamemode, but don’t suggest to break the core game with shit like “weapon modes”… LOL.</p>

            <p>On the topic of multiplayer, it is not that well balanced, well the power weapons are not. There is a reason most games use different stats in MP then in single player. and black mesa’s MP feels lacking to say the least, to much chaos. As it is all it takes in one person getting to the gluon and tau spawn and well game over.</p>
<p>That said I don’t think anything really needs nerfed or buffed, Well except the gluon cause that is a pain weapon to use and fight. and the snarks cause they are useless.</p>
<p>suggestion: make it so that the gluon and tau have NO ammo at their spawn point and that you can not reload by standing on the spawn, instead put ammo for them out in the open in areas of low to no cover. this should remove most the problems with them as players will have to stay mobile to use them instead of camping the spawn/ammo.</p>
<p>suggestion2: make it so the pack on the gluon gun is visible even if you do not have it equipped and make it so that shooting the person in the back can blow the pack. if the shot kills them. (taking the weapon out until a respawn) (would require the gluon to be none respawning until this happens)</p>
<p>ALSO BUFF THE SNARKS, they are pretty much useless, in SP and MP.</p>
<p>also would suggest adding a m16 to the game for MP</p>
<p>m16<br>
ammo: 9mm (only for pickups)<br>
primary: burst fire<br>
secondary: iron sights.<br>
ammo: 30/90</p>
<p>reason for weapon, higher damage more accurate AR for the more “tactical” players allowing for even the none twitch shooters to have a weapon they can use.</p>

<p>Multiplayer games with super strong weapons destroying players in just one or two hits always have these issues that one skilled gamer with no life will rule the game.

<p>No, that’s not good for n00bs, because they won’t learn the game that way. People should accept what Half-Life is and what it does offer instead of just playing it casually. Half-Life is a game with learning curve and it requires dedication. It really hurts to always read stupid comments like yours… And yes, in Adrenaline Gamer there were gamemodes like arena or arcade which let you spawn with all weapons. It’s OK if you want to play a casual gamemode, but don’t suggest to break the core game with shit like “weapon modes”… LOL.</p>

            <p>We’re working on more refinements to the gameplay and ways to help the community along. These things take time.</p>
<p>The game has quite a skill gap. Issues related to higher skilled players beating up on new ones can only really be resolved when we firstly have more players, and when we have ways to better segment them.</p>

            <p>And you think you’re going to get those updates when…?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Skill tiered servers, do we have the playercount for those kind of servers? Last night there was about 10 people playing.<br>
When I’m posting this, there are 4. If there were more players on the server, the tau wouldn’t be so much of an issue, but due to the playercounts it currently is.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to dumb down the game, just make it easier for new people to come into the play and not ragequit when getting instant-killed,<br>
which I saw some people do when I played last night.</p>

            <p>It’s not a problem of the game’s item balance, it’s only a problem of servers, missing matchmaking, missing multiplayer-tutorials, missing bots and high skill range… the only other way I see to fix this problem is adding skill tiered servers…</p>

            <p>pick up more armor and improve your movement/dodge/positioning… tau netcode should also get reviewed, because sometimes it seems to hit when normally it shouldn’t have hit. I am against a big tau damage nerf, because tau is meant to be the strongest map control item together with crossbow and longjump. Too much tau-damage nerf would also make wallgauss useless. Unarmored players should always be 1 shot by a fully charged tau shot. Explosives and egon are strong enaugh already and because of that a tau damage nerf really wouldn’t make any sense.</p>

            <p>I did play my fair share of Half-Life: Source deathmatch when I was younger, I have touched hl1:dm a few times as well.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s the moment speed that is slower in source, but I just feel like it’s more of an issue now.<br>
Lower the damage of the tau so you can’t oneshot people with it, or decrease the headshot multiplier.<br>
Cause right now a skilled player with a tau has a really huge skilldifference towards a player not using the tau. It’s like the only weapons worth using are the energy based ones.<br>
When the servers do have an autokick for the K/D score, then there is something that needs a fix.</p>
<p>Sure I can improve my play and I will. But for new players who come and play and then are brutally buttraped, I doubt they’d want to play again.</p>

            <p>have you ever played HL1DM? It was always 70% about mastering the tau-cannon… That’s just how this game works. But I agree that they need to improve weapon balance (slightly increase rate of fire of shotgun, speed up reload on shotgun slightly, reduce damage of shotgun primary slightly, fix netcode on zoomed crossbow, fix crossbow rapidfire bug, remove recoil from MP5, reduce damage of pistol, MP5 and 357 slightly, tweak charge up for the tau, maybe reduce tau damage very very slightly, maybe also reduce tau headshot multiplyer from x3 to x1.5, add wallgauss, remove handgrenade from spawn weapons, buff satchel, tripmine and snark damage and increase damage radius for satchels and tripmines, increase satchel throw range or implement HL1 physics for satchels, tweak tripmine hitbox further, make snarks run around more… make them more agressive, make them bhop faster, increase ammolimit for MP5 grenades to 5, reduce MP5 grenade speed, fix RPG reload and rapidfire-trick, tweak the angle in which the RPG follows the laserdot - in my opinion it should be smaller, allow players to skip weapon draw animation after very short delay (skip it by pressing shoot, shoot2 or reload), it’s also very important to improve hit feedback… for example few blood on body shots, much blood on headshots and tau or crossbow body hits… ideally I’d love to see death animations too… this way you have a cooler combat feel and you clearly see if you did a headshot-kill or not… but I guess death animations would cost too much ressources… with these changes egon will be balanced) and improve movement (increase acceleration on ground, add circlejump, slightly increase air-control and increase LJ hight slightly - I think these changes are maybe even more important than the weapon changes… optional bhop as a server setting is also important for the future)… If you want, add me on steam and i can help you improve.</p>

<p>Please balance the weapons. Now the most players use only 2-3 of them. The total abuse of the OP weapons will drive a lot of the players away from the game. I am not even sure if they have fun. The score players ruin the game. My 2 cents.</p>

<p>This, I’m a semi-noob at this game, sure.</p>
<p>Had a decent round of playing around with sort of equallity skilled players, pro player joins in, starts oneshotting/two shotting people with the tau, taunting ppl “come on kill me girls.”<br>
Kinda takes the fun out of the game.</p>
