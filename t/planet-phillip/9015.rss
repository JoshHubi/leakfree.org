            <p>Let’s not forget the mapping competitions he had too… that was so very cool. Made mappers think outside box - and some came up with some pretty funky shit.</p>
<p>And if it was not for PP, I probably would not have stumbled upon Research &amp; Development… which is fucking epic… and my favorite mod (until BMS of course).</p>
<p>Man-o-man, do I have a serious soft spot for this type of stuff… like when a mom/pop store closes etc. I do hate to see tons and tons of work go into anything… and not flourish… or provide the payoff, prosperity or whatever kind of rewards that it so very much deserves.</p>
<p>But Phil should be proud of what he <span class="bbcode-i">did </span>accomplish. He made a world-class site that not many could produce. And would look great on a resume/portfolio, if webdev is his gig.</p>

            <p>Seems really sudden.  I wasn’t an avid reader but I liked his site and his support for mods and maps.  The replay experiment was really cool too.  If he doesn’t want to do it, more power to him.  These things really can take a lot out of you.  However, I hope he at least puts the site back up so we can still browse the site and possibly download the maps.  Hope to see him return on October.</p>

            <p>I can’t say I’ll miss the maps, but I did enjoy reading his posts. I’m sad to see it go, but I can respect his decision. If he doesn’t like doing it anymore, then he shouldn’t do it.</p>

            <p>That is extremely sad indeed…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Many a map have I downloaded from there… so many hours and hours of kick-ass maps and mods, that he did such a terrific job of organizing – and making so easy to read about, view screenshot galleries of ALL maps, download maps/mods and review them…</p>
<p>Then, there seemed to be less and less new content, and I figured it would only be a matter of time. Damn! I am sure part of this was due to less HL2 maps being made…</p>
<p>I won a free orange box from Mr. Marlowe, in one of his giveaways… which he sent from Spain (I think he is a brit, living in Spain) to NE Ohio at no charge to me… plus we exchanged a couple emails and he really seems like such good guy.</p>
<p>Oh, this sucks. If you are reading these Phil, thank you so much for everything, and the very best of luck with whatever will replace PP for you.</p>
