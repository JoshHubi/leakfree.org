    <title>357. to shotgun replacement</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/357-to-shotgun-replacement/11786</link>
    <description>Hi. Is there anyone able to make shotgun in office complex and we&#39;ve got hostiles instead of .357 magnum ? Because in the original Half Life it was a shotgun not magnum so I was kinda dissapointed when they changed that because I love shooting zombies with shotguns in this level. Is there any way to change game codes or maps so it will have shotguns instead of magnum ? For example the place when magnum is pickable it will be replaced with pickable shotguns and when there are pickable shotgun, there will be pickable magnum. Also security guards wielding magnums must be changed to the ones wearing shotguns because if they die they would drop magnum so you would have both shotgun and magnum.</description>

            <p>just open the counsel with ` after activating it and enter “sv_cheats 1” and then good old impluse 101 or “give weapon_shotgun” and before you run out of ammo enter givecurrentammo and it will give you full carry load(64 unless you change it) or if you run out then enter “give item_ammo_buckshot”<br>
and givecurrentammo doesn’t require sv_cheats to be set to 1 and also you can change the max ammo carried again without sv_cheats set to 1, it’s “sk_max_buckshot xxx” you have to replace xxx with a number<br>
have fun</p>

            <p>Decompiling and recompiling can be really hard because you’d have to reconstruct some of the map’s optimizations. You’re really just better off giving yourself a shotgun through the console.</p>

            <p>That’s true. Entity editors would save the hassle of going through all that compiling.</p>

            <p>I’ve never tried one, but I think there’s BSP entity editors you can fuss with. You could just switch out the magnum stuff with the Spas and buckshot. You could also do the same decompiling and modifying the maps the maps, but that’s probably way more time consuming than it’s worth. Your best bet would be to use console commands as said above. You were just gonna switch the weapons out anyway, no reason not to just use a console command.</p>
<p>Edit: son of a bitch, This thing types slow. Ninja’d :I</p>

            <p>This method works really bad. Shotgun is visible yes but it still looks like magnum before you pick it up, and also has no secondary fire and security guards wielding them doesn’t actually shoot. Any diffrent ideas ?</p>

<p>Its one of those, just enter that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Or you could find someone who knows Hammer to look into the map and replace the Magnum with a Shotgun, maybe Text’ll have some spare time</p>
