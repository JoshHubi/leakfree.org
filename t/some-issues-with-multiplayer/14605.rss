    <title>Some issues with multiplayer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-issues-with-multiplayer/14605</link>
    <description>Hi, first and foremost, thanks for this great game! I really enjoy it so far. I&#39;ve found some issues not reported here or in the patch log:

Sometimes after respawning the weapon and hand model is missing. Cannot see which weapon I have out.
Sound issues: the tau weapon charge sound cannot be heard when I load it, and a lot of sounds get muted. Happens in all the maps, maybe it is a hardware or driver issue?

No idea how to help you reproduce them or if these are already known.

Cheers.</description>
