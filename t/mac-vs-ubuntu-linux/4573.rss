    <description>LETS DEBATE SHALL WE

Mac OSX is based off UNIX and has similiar characteristics to Ubuntu but Ubuntu is much cheaper and much more compatible. Plus Ubuntu doesnt screw you over if you want to install it on pc. Mac would be so much better if only it were compatible with PC! 

Ubuntu is free open source os that can be modified heavily to suit your needs. Ran it on my computer very zippy and lag free FTW! It has tons of compatibiliy with tons of different Hardware.The major drawbacks for ubuntu you may have to refer to the terminal for help this is very confusing for most casual windows and mac users.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I use openSUSE 11.2 as the primary OS on my laptop. I also have Windows 2008 Server and Win7 on my desktop, for coding Windows software and occasionally playing games (though I mainly play on the PS3). I’ve been using Linux almost exclusively since, I think, 2006 and I’m pretty sure this won’t change. It has far less hardware issues than Windows, is more intuitive and more customizable ─ and, most importantly, faster, more stable and more reliable than Windows.<br>
Also, Mac OS X is UNIX, not UNIX-like. I’ve only used it for a little time at my dad’s lab but the experience wasn’t too pleasant.</p>

<p>Get it for free, get every program you’d ever need on it for free, invent a font with a brand new alphabet and invent a new keymapping for it that can be toggled with Shift-CapsLock and have it integrate seamlessly with existing fonts, even adapting between regular spacing and monospaced environments if you didn’t designate the font that way.</p>
<p>Seriously, I made an alphabet, not monospaced, and went into gedit (notepad equivalent). When I typed in my alphabet’s unicode range that no other installed font supported, I saw my font with its alphabet. When I enabled Monospace, it ignored the spacing of my font and chose a spacing that worked for 90% of the characters, with just some slight overlap on my big characters like M.</p>
<p>It’s little really-pleasing things like that which make Ubuntu more lovable than your own mother. Macintosh is like the creepy uncle that does things without you wanting him to…</p>

            <p>Creating symbolic and hard links, using terminal programs (which are many times faster to use and more flexible) and other terminal features, installing programs faster and with safety (instead of looking for a random program in the Internet that does what you want and downloading viruses), finding the program you want in a more organized start menu, not having to check for viruses and run defrag…<br>
I personally have a hard time using Windows.</p>

<p>I disagree. While Linux might need more steps to perform some tasks, it is much more flexible. There are tons of things that Windows won’t let you do. I never used OSX but if it withholds the power that the user has as much as Windows, then it sucks as much as the latter.</p>

            <p>I always viewed operating systems as workers.</p>
<p>Windows and OSX are the ones that you just tell to go sweep a floor, and they’ll automatically go to the cleaning-stuff closet, grab a broom and mop and vacuumcleaner, go to the area they need to clean and perform the task (with Windows being the foreigner that doesn’t understand English very well (with “Are you sure” being the equivalent of “Que?!?”).</p>
<p>Linux is the worker that if you tell him to go sweep, you have to hold his hand, take him the closet, show him what a broom is, then show him the area he has to sweep, and he then goes to perform that task very well (if not better than Windows and OSX).</p>
<p>In short: Linux-based OSs seem to be the most basic of basic OSs, they’re for those that are willing to put time and effort in it to get things going. Therefore, I’ll take OSX over Windows, and OSX and Windows over Linux.</p>
