    <description>Hey, I&#39;m an author at nakedrobber.com (video game blog for people who enjoy dead hooker jokes and ignorant geek humor)

I&#39;ve been waiting for Black Mesa for what feels like eternity, so I thought I might as well throw up an article about it. I thought you guys and girls might be interested in so I&#39;m posting it up here.

Feel free to throw out a couple comments if you like it or hate.

Cheers</description>

            <p>Well I’m glad someone out there appreciates dead hooker jokes!</p>
<p>Sorry if the title mislead anyone, but thanks for giving it a read. I hope a few of you got some laughs out of it.</p>
<p>Now it’s back to waiting for black mesa to come out. I guess I’ll return to my usual routine of staring at a wall and ignoring my English lessons from high school.</p>

            <p>Complaining in an aggressive/childish manner will only give the company a reason not to comply.<br>
Good on you Catz for getting that sorted within an hour in an intelligent and calm manner. :3</p>

            <p>The almighty power of the pen.  The ability to put together an intelligent paragraph is undervalued these days.</p>
<p>Case in point.  My son bought a blackberry on ebay in January, but when he got it, it came with the wrong data cable.  Since then, he has been writing them asking for a replacement.  His grammar and sentence phrasing screamed 12 year old.</p>
<p>Finally yesterday I had enough of seeing emails go back and forth so I stepped in.  I wrote a long email detailing the purchase, the specs, and a photo of what was sent and a photo of what we should have recieved and a requested date of when we could expect a resolution.  I then put in a negative rating on ebay.</p>
<p>I got a call from head of customer service within the hour and we came to an agreement where my son would get the $25 bucks it would cost to get a data cable.</p>
<p>Was it the ebay negative rating? Was it the lengthy email? I dunno.  But I would like to think that having the ability to complain in detail but in a non agressive way helped.</p>

            <p>The thread title didn’t really describe the article enough, though, it’s more of a “This mod is awesome, check it out!” article.</p>
<p>Work on your grammar though.</p>
