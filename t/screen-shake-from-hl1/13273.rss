    <description>Hi

Remember how when certain events happened in half-life such as the gargantua stomping around, the screen would shake. If I remember correctly it would also effect the players movement slightly. I am pretty sure it isn&#39;t in BMS, I think it would be cool.</description>

            <p>I think they should include something like this in the new release it would really make the game more realistic.</p>

<p>There’s also screen shaking in Opposing Force when you’re walking by those giant killer fans</p>
<p>To be honest, I think viewbob and screen tilting when strafing is plenty ‘realistic’</p>
<p>Maybe a slight downwards jerk when you land from a jump though?</p>

<p>Those fans! That’s right, it was fun kinda like a mini game within the game itself. To me it all added extra stuff to think about while playing. If there was none of that it would be way easier to just speed run through the game. I say yes to more skill being involved with player movement puzzles.</p>

<p>Mr Anderson says a screen shake would be good.</p>
<p>I agree</p>
