    <description>Hey guys

I just completed the current version of Black Mesa for the second time. Now, I was wondering when the steam version finally releases, will my progress and achievements cross over to that version. Or do I need to replay the whole game again en get my achievenements a second time?

Cheers!</description>

<p>No matter, I’ll replay the game for a 3rd time. It’s a well done project after all!</p>

<p>If you want to jump ahead anyway, I believe you can unlock the menu options for the chapters by typing in “sv_unlockedchapters 15” (though I have no idea if this will work on their version of the engine).</p>

            <p>Ideally, but who’s to say you cant get away with loading from your save data? Just listing possible causes of why it might go wrong if it does.</p>

            <p>So basically in order to run it properly, I need to replay the game.</p>

            <p>Achievements won’t be able to transfer over. Now game save data is a bit tricky. The save files are totally backwards compatible, however it might cause some unexpected results or possibly crashes in some cases. A few reasons this could occur would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>That area of the map on the save file has been altered compared to the retail build.</li>
<li>Certain cached settings on the save file for that map has been altered and no longer valid on the retail version causing unexpected playback results.<br>
However, there are commands that you can enter in the console~ that will allow you to unlock chapters.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Your save should work, albeit with some bugs possibly present. Your achievements won’t transfer over.</p>
