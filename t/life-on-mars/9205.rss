<blockquote>
<p>According to NASA administrator Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden, Jr., the highly experimental glam space program—dubbed Project Starman—has been in development for exactly five years. Though engineers initially feared the mission might “blow our minds,” the historic launch ultimately proceeded without incident.</p>
<p>NASA chief engineer Mike Ryschkewitsch said that Moonage Daydream differs from earlier shuttle models in several significant ways. Though the overall shape is similar to previous crafts, the exterior of the $4.5 billion vehicle has been fitted with improved shielding, making it better equipped to withstand the hazy cosmic jive.</p>
<p>In addition to the shuttle redesign, several other daring changes have been made to NASA’s equipment. According to Ryschkewitsch, the astronauts, or “spaceboys,” as they will be called during the mission, are equipped with state-of-the-art pressurized suits.<br>
“These new suits are veneered with a protective silver lamé to complement the multicolored lightning bolts emblazoned across the helmets’ sun visors,” Ryschkewitsch said. “They’ve also been updated with several improved components to ensure the team is completely safe when it’s time to leave the capsule—if they dare.”</p>
<p>The five-member crew is made up entirely of United States Air Force officers and includes Maj. Tom Louis, Maj. Tom Greely, Maj. Tom Ohweiler, Maj. Thomas Sinclair, and Maj. Tom Keenan.</p>
<p>While the mission will primarily study paranoia, decadence, and the fluidity of sexual identity in a zero-gravity environment, additional scientific testing will be conducted during the shuttle’s 14-day orbit of Earth.</p>
<p>“One of the experiments we’re most excited about will address the effects of Mars-like conditions on several different species of arachnids,” NASA biologist Norman Stern said.</p>
<p>Public response to the project has been generally positive. Many Americans, however, consider the mission an egotistical and self-indulgent waste of taxpayer money.</p>
<p>“I just don’t see this launch having any sort of lasting influence on future space exploration,” St. Louis attorney Kevin Moran said. “Certainly NASA has to take risks to further mankind’s knowledge, but this mission is simply too ambitious in scope to sustain mainstream interest.”</p>

<p>According to the very respected and credible hypothesis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Panspermia</a>, there is water on mars because we all came from mars (this isn’t actually a joke.)</p>
<p>"[i]Panspermia does not necessarily suggest that life originated only once and subsequently spread through the entire Universe, but instead that once started, it may be able to spread to other environments suitable for replication. Opponents of the idea that life originated on Mars, and came to Earth on meteorites, have always been able to point to the huge impacts needed to eject rocks from the Martian surface. Surely, they argue, this would have killed any life they carried. Not so, says a study of the forces involved.</p>
<p>Rocks can be ejected when a giant meteorite impact sends an intense pressure wave across the surface of a planet. To see if microbes could withstand these pressures, Dieter Stoffler at the Fraunhofer Institute for High-Speed Dynamics in Freiburg, Germany, and his team put thin layers of microbes between two sheets of gabbro, a rock similar to the coarse-grained basalts found on Mars. They then detonated a mix of explosives on a steel plate on top of the rock, generating shock waves that subjected the microbes to pressures of up to 50 gigapascals, the equivalent of 500,000 …[/i]"</p>
<p>Basically, meteorites crashed into mars, picked up plenty of microscopic organisms and molecules, and then landed on Earth, where the two would finally mature and life was instead produced on Earth. There’s more to it, but not that I can remember off the top of my head; Google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Panspermia</a>.</p>

            <p>Obviously, but his contention about advanced lifeforms having mental breakdowns about us leaving stuff there is silly.</p>
<p>So forth if Panspermia is correct, or even real as a hypothesis there would have to be some life on mars to suggest that we originated from. If life that small can survive an meteor ride, than it’s less surprising that it exists on Mars. Basically, it doesn’t say much for the surface of mars being able to sustain advanced forms of life, yet.</p>

            <p>It’s a long trip, and they send transmissions – no need for them to come home.</p>
<p>…And on the off-chance that you’re not joking, life isn’t quite sustainable on Mars.</p>

            <p>I heard that the rovers sent to Mars are never built to return back to Earth? Why the fuck not? If there happens to be martians there and they see all the rubbish we’ve left on their planet, we are screwed.</p>

            <p>According to the very respected and credible hypothesis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Panspermia</a>, there is water on mars because we all came from mars (this isn’t actually a joke.)</p>
<p>"[i]Panspermia does not necessarily suggest that life originated only once and subsequently spread through the entire Universe, but instead that once started, it may be able to spread to other environments suitable for replication. Opponents of the idea that life originated on Mars, and came to Earth on meteorites, have always been able to point to the huge impacts needed to eject rocks from the Martian surface. Surely, they argue, this would have killed any life they carried. Not so, says a study of the forces involved.</p>
<p>Rocks can be ejected when a giant meteorite impact sends an intense pressure wave across the surface of a planet. To see if microbes could withstand these pressures, Dieter Stoffler at the Fraunhofer Institute for High-Speed Dynamics in Freiburg, Germany, and his team put thin layers of microbes between two sheets of gabbro, a rock similar to the coarse-grained basalts found on Mars. They then detonated a mix of explosives on a steel plate on top of the rock, generating shock waves that subjected the microbes to pressures of up to 50 gigapascals, the equivalent of 500,000 …[/i]"</p>
<p>Basically, meteorites crashed into mars, picked up plenty of microscopic organisms and molecules, and then landed on Earth, where the two would finally mature and life was instead produced on Earth. There’s more to it, but not that I can remember off the top of my head; Google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Panspermia</a>.</p>

            <p>btw “bio-life” (in the video) is a pretty ridiculous term</p>
<p>it basically means “life-life”</p>

            <p>I’d like to see you try and explain how plant-like life is possible on a planet without an atmosphere.</p>

            <p>I watched that video about Mars and i’m ashamed I have because it must have been researched by a two year old. Like I said… learn your facts before you post nonsense. I’m done posting stuff in your ridiculous threads.</p>
