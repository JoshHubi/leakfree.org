            <p>I have created steam controller config to optimize gameplay and make navigating menus possible. If anyone is interested it is published in community configs with my nickname.</p>
<p>For developers: it would be great if auto-aim option reappeared in settings. Most of gameplay on controller is pleasurable but in few situations scene is crawling with enemies and survival becomes so much harder than when using mouse. Precise shooting distant enemies on controller without auto-aim is almost impossible.</p>
