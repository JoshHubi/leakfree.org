    <title>Hammer Decal Problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hammer-decal-problem/7958</link>
    <description>Alright, so I just started getting a really weird problem with hammer. Every time I place certain decals (lambda sign, trash, overall about half of them) in my map, they end up tiled four times. This doesn&#39;t happen anywhere else, and doesn&#39;t happen if I delete my whole map, which is obviously a less than optimal solution.

Any ideas what the hell is going on?</description>

            <p>Apparently it’s only in hammer, compiled maps don’t have this problem. Weird, but ah well.</p>
