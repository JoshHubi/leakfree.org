    <description>While many people disagree I think it is very possible. By looking at the extent of damage in Portal 2 I would say it is very feasible for that level of damage to occur during a 20 year period.

For my argument I will bring up two points 

1. Chernobyl: This country was abandoned on the date of April 26th, 1986 due to a nuclear meltdown. The level of damage due to the lack of maintenance from the abandonment of people is currently at a 25 year period.

2. History Channel video that originated from t.v. series &quot;Life After People.&quot; About 5 minutes long. Speculates level of damage from abandoment ranging to 150 year long period (jumps from 6, 10, 60, then 150 years.)


20 years is more than enough time for plant growth to completely take over something as confined as Aperture labs. without any sort of maintenance plant life takes over which thus causes cracks in walls, concrete, etc. Running water which then is frozen and thawed constantly would widen cracks and of course weaken the structure of the building thus giving the old Aperture look.



You are free to disagree with me. While the video I provided only covered 10 years (then jumped to 60 years for unknown reasons) I would imagine that 20 years would look twice as bad as ten.

If Aperture labs was indeed that old the weather conditions in the location of Aperture would cause Aperture labs to crumble (merely due to rain causing cracks in the cement which thus forces the weight of the earth to crush the Facilities.) Moreover the technology certainly wouldn&#39;t work that far into the future. Jet fuel I believe has a shelf life of 10 years. A computer such as GlaDDOS wouldn&#39;t function at all.[/SIZE]

<ol>
<li>Combine Wiki isn’t a 100% accurate source</li>
<li>That doesn’t mean that they’re going to intercept. If Portal 2 takes place hundreds of years in the future there could be something that kind of foreshadows Portal 2. There could also be an epilogue or something. Just because Portal 2 will make something in Ep3 make sense doesn’t mean that they NEED to take place in the same time period.</li>

</aside>
<p>I can name plenty of other games not running source that have realistic physics too, it’s not a waste if you want an immersive game. and realistic creature design is not much of a point to make. Because most games try for plausible creatures due to, again, immersion. Also everything in Half-Life and portal is based on one realistic factor being worm holes, the rest is complete and total science fiction.</p>
<p>My point is the length between Portal and Portal 2 is as short or as long as any fan wants to believe until its cleared up by someone from Valve, WHICH IT HAS NOT BEEN. Therefore all you guys are doing is speculating with no real way to know for sure.</p>

            <p>The climate in Half Life is changed, that’s for sure. Most of the animal life is dead, so is our kind. The global work of the Combine (industry and so on) should have done quite an impact on Earth’s spheres. And if you want to go deeper, Ok. We can see that in Half Life, all people are wearing overalls of some sort and the weather isn’t that sunny but is not that cold, so this leads to a conclusion that an artificial (or lets say anthropogenic) global warming is at hand. Only the most resilient of plant life should’ve survived. And in that way of thinking, the consumers of O2 are almost gone - the few forests, having the most capable species of surviving, produce enough oxygen for them. So this is what we see in Half Life. And in Portal we hear birds singing, right? I don’t remember that in HL, except the crows of course, but they survive well in cities as well in forests…the cockroaches of the sky  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

Perky, Valve developed this source engine that puts the rl physics in a virtual game, they wasted much time and efford for this; the science part of the story has a logic too; time is also spent on working on the Xen creatures…creating new kind of life our of nothing; small details all over the place, most of it trully unnecessery but still in place…and you want to tell me that this is a “game” and they can just piss on all this and put 50000 years out of nothing in the story? I think the developers have in mind to put all this sci fi theme in the most realistic way possible. Otherwise, whats the point of having another fps…</p>

            <p>Mosses and evergreen trees definitely fit in the same ecological niche as deciduous trees: they need sunlight to photosynthesize.  Although I did just go and look at some screenshots of HL2 and its episodes, and it appears that it was cloudy most of the time.  I’d remembered Highway 17, at least, as being clear and blue.</p>
<p>Still, it’s far too <span class="bbcode-i">bright</span> to assume that the Combine have blocked the sun, and if you look at places like the White Forest, you see that the plant life is doing just fine.</p>
<p>Hell, I’m from Seattle, originally; I’m definitely qualified to say that constant cloud cover  doesn’t mess with the plant life.</p>

            <p>Or it’s autumn.  You said that nothing could grow.  First, forgetting that would make the Earth inhospitable without some way to generate breathable air, you see that things are growing.  And the sun is not blocked out.  It is bright day.  If the sun was blocked out, it would be perpetual night.  But the sun is shining onto the inn.  See the shadows?</p>

            <p>I love that you guys are complaining about the realism and logistics of a game about making portals. It’s a game it could take place 50,000 years in the future for all we know because its a game, and anything can happen in the land of make-believe. Everything in the Half-Life/Portal universe that isn’t set in stone at this point is up to interpretation.</p>
