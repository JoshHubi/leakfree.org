    <title>GLITCH: Red Crosshair in single player game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glitch-red-crosshair-in-single-player-game/14148</link>
    <description>Hello to everyone! I was playing a multiplayer match and, as we know, while you are aiming an enemy the crosshair in the HUD becomes red. The issue is that when you leave the match exactly when you are aiming an opponent, if you start a singleplayer game the crosshair will be still colored in red!

This is the evidence of this issue:

I didn&#39;t find only this bug, so I&#39;ll report them as soon as possible... Bye for now!    :smiley:</description>
