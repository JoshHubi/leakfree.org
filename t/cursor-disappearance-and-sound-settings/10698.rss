    <title>Cursor disappearance, and sound settings.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cursor-disappearance-and-sound-settings/10698</link>
    <description>Hi, first of all I&#39;d like to congratulate you for an awesome mod. I thought this needed to be said.

I have two slight bugs with my Black Mesa client, the first one is about the sound: I&#39;m using only 2 speakers, but I have a 5.1 setup that I only use when watching TV (due to the position of the speakers). Everytime I leave the game and relaunch it, my sound settings are back in 5.1, all of my other settings seems to &quot;stick&quot; though. The result is that I basically can&#39;t hear anything going on behind me. It&#39;s just a settings issue, but it&#39;s a little annoying.

My other problem is a lot more important, I sometimes lost the crosshair on my screen. It seems to happen whenever I&#39;m zooming with the crossbow (love the crossbow zoom) and save my game. Then none of my weapon will have its crosshair, and I&#39;m forced to leave and restart the game to get the crosshair back.


In case this is of any relevance, I&#39;m playing using Windows 7.

Thank you for your time.</description>

<p>Seconded. Using console command ‘crosshair 1’ only temporarily fixes the problem, or enabling the gamepad/joystick option. Once the crosshair has disappeared, despite causing it to re-appear, everytime I hit quicksave it vanishes. Don’t have to have the crossbow equipped for this either.</p>
