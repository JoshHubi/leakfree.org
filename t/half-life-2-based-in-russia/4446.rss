    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-2-based-in-russia/4446</link>
    <description>so as im sure as many of you have asked yourself, where does half-life 2 take place? well after playing all of the games again i realized that there are signs everywhere in the game, but there not in english, there in russian. So does it take place in russia, or in ukraine, or what?</description>

            <p>Probably because one of the modelers or artists at Valve saw it on 24 &amp; liked it. Who honestly needs a better reason?</p>

<p>You are wrong, sir. Fictional guns? What the fuck. The shotgun is a spas12 modified. there is an HKMp7 and an RPG. Combine/resistance made grenades. The Ar2 is combine technology. The pistol looks like an HK. The vehicles are definitely Russian.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The MP7 looks like the prototype, but has an impossibly small built-in grenade launcher with no trigger for it. The shotgun can fire two shots simultaneously despite having a single barrel. The RPG looks like a AT4 in first person, but has a different model in third person view &amp; fires laser-guided RPGs that do not exist. The hand grenade uses a smoke grenade model but is a fragmentation grenade. Everything else is an alien pulse-weapon or mandible &amp; the number of those vastly out weigh the ‘real’ weapons like the pistols &amp; crowbar.</p>

<p>You just think it’s Russia because you can’t tell one Eastern European things apart. <a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/City_17#Background_and_origins_of_City_17" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The architecture &amp; writing is an amalgam of different Eastern European locations</a> while the aerial view of the city from the citadel (&amp; several of the most recent maps leaked &amp; cut from the game) is a satellite image of New York City at night.</p>
<p>City 17 is as much a fictional city as Aperture Laboratories is a fictional building.</p>

<p>The USP Match in 9mm, more specifically. Of course, the actual production line was discontinued in 1999. Wonder why the Combine chose to outfit CP units with a target pistol?</p>

<p>Majority of world population is not aware that there is something called Bulgaria. Those who heard about it either think it’s part of Russia, or they don’t know that Bulgarians also use azbuka (alphabet).</p>
<p>Secondly, Šachta pobědy (Mine of victory, Victory mines) in episode 2 is Russian name.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you looked at all the words written on the papers/graffiti/company signs, you would know that everything is written in Bulgarian. City 17 was designed off a town called Sofia, which as it turns out, is also in Bulgaria. One of the few influences of Russia is the name Nevsky Prospekt, a street in St. Petersburg, influencing the name “Nova Prospekt.”</p>
<p>I don’t understand why everyone keeps saying everything is written in Russian. I’ve only seen maybe 3 russian words in the whole game. If I were using common sense, I’d say Bulgaria, not Russia.</p>

<p>I think we can all agree that it’s just fictional city somewhere in Europe and the reason why they all speak American is probably that North-America itself is inhospitable because it was so close to Black Mesa and they mass moved to Europe where it was a bit safer. Original population probably extinct or something ( except for fisherman and gregory )</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Didn’t know there was a language called “American”. And could the reason be simply because most players would be speaking “American”, and would otherwise hate to read subtitles?</p>

<p>Odessa is a pretty prominent coastal town north of Romania. I think Valve may have used it as inspiration for Highway 17, but as we’ve examined plenty of other cities were used to build up City 17 itself.</p>

            <p>The location of City 17 is meant to be anonymous.  If you look very thoroughly there are clues leading to it being in several places.  I personally think that it wasn’t a preexisting city and that the combine took parts of various citys and put them into one.  The mixed up state of the city might demoralize people and take away a sense of home for anyone who lived there.</p>

            <p>i don’t really feel like going thru 3 pages(maybe more?)</p>
<p>possibly near Ukraine(i think) if you look on the map before highway 17, you will see a town called new Odessa. Odessa is a town in Ukraine(atleast USSR area).</p>
<p>ignore the fact that there is an Odessa, Texas as well.</p>

            <p>I just saw a Batman movie and I fucking swear it’s buildings are very identical to one in Half Life 2 Beta and Retail. Go see it for yourself, find the movie: Batman: Forever</p>

            <p>I think we can all agree that it’s just fictional city somewhere in Europe and the reason why they all speak American is probably that North-America itself is inhospitable because it was so close to Black Mesa and they mass moved to Europe where it was a bit safer. Original population probably extinct or something ( except for fisherman and gregory )</p>

            <p>I’m sure the errors were intentional. As was said before, the devs made sure City 17 couldn’t be pegged to any specific location.</p>

            <p>Actually didn’t. I was just reading around the info on Black Mesa, saw the discussions and went on to read 'em. But thanks for your “kind” welcome. :meh:</p>
<p>Back to Nexus. There are some mistakes on the model though (deliberate or not). Like asymetric windows. The real building is symetric.</p>

<p>incidentally, the Nexus in C17 was based on the Parliament of <span class="bbcode-b">Siberia</span></p>

<p>Serbia, not Siberia.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  Siberia is not a country.</p>
<p>Siberia = large area in the northern &amp; central ex-USSR.<br>
Serbia = a small country that was part of Yugoslavia in the south-eastern europe.</p>
<p>Serbia is one of the Bulgaria’s nearest neighbours on the west. So if art director was Bulgarian it’s not unlikely (and building really looks the same) for the building to be inspired by Serbian parliament.</p>
