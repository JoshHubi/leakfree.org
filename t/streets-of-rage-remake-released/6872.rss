Download it for great justice! The remake includes all of the original 3 games as well as alternate routes and new stages, new weapons, gore, better visual effects, online/lan multiplayer, bots, modding, remixed soundtrack, tons of unlockables and other shit. And if you didn&#39;t like Streets of Rage then you&#39;re a drain on society.</description>
