    <title>Mine field 2 (bm_c2a5e ), cannot save the guard and it doesn&#39;t matter [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mine-field-2-bm-c2a5e-cannot-save-the-guard-and-it-doesnt-matter-fixed/10630</link>
    <description>On the level bm_c2a5e there is a scene with a guard crawling on the ground begging for help. A scientist approaches him, but then you see a laser beam from a vent, and - BAM! - a sniper kills the guard (and may kill the scientist too).

Now, with the rocket launcher you can kill the sniper. There are, however, a few issues
1. You CANNOT kill the sniper beforeahand. If you haven&#39;t seen the guard on the ground begging to save him, you can shoot the vent, and it doesn&#39;t get destroyed.
2. If you kill the sniper, the guard dies (??) anyway. The scientist keeps staying obent over him, both say nothing - no thanks, no examplanation, no reaction at all.
3. If you kill the guard, the sniper DOESN&#39;T EVEN SHOW UP, though you can still kill him shooting at the vent.

Err.. this looks kinda strange.  :slight_smile:  One would expect at least some kind of a reaction.
