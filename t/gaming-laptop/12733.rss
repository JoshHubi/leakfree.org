    <description>Is there really such thing? I want to get a laptop but I want to be able to play online games on it without having to suffer horrific lag and graphics. So is there really such thing as a gaming laptop without having to spend over $500?</description>

            <p>I have an hp Elitebook 8460p for work, which is equipped with a Radeon 6470m. It’s definitely not designed to be a gaming laptop, yet it is surprisingly competent at it. Mass Effect 3 is quite playable, which I did not expect, and Source games run very well also - no surprise there though since Source is so light weight. My laptop was purchased on ebay though, and I suspect the seller did not understand what he had (there are two versions of this laptop, one with integrated graphics and the kind I have, with AMD graphics), so it ended up being quite cheap, only about $400-500 I think. So look around, scout out craigslist and ebay, you might find a good deal on a used laptop that will suit your needs.</p>

            <p>Make sure to get something that cools well, too. Heat is a major concern for a gaming laptop.</p>

            <p>A good gaming laptop is gonna cost you something close to $1000 at least, I believe. You can probably get something decent at a lower price but you’re not gonna play the latest games all maxed out that’s for sure.</p>
