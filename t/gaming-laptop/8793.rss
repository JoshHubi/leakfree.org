    <title>Gaming laptop?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gaming-laptop/8793</link>
    <description>TL;DR is the [url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834246328&#39;]Lenovo IdeaPad Z575[/url] able to play BF3 on low (with FPS of 30+)/ a decent gaming laptop in general?

I&#39;m going to be a freshman in college in the coming months, and my desktop is struggling to run the new releases I want to play, so I&#39;m in the market for a new PC. Originally, I was thinking a desktop/shitty netbook combination, so I would have the benefits of gaming on a desktop and the benefits of working on a portable machine. However, people have been trying to convince me to just get a gaming laptop, and it&#39;s been working a little bit, as I like the thought of being able to play games at college and then bring it home, to relatives/friends&#39; houses, etc. So I&#39;ve been looking for an inexpensive laptop that I&#39;ll be able to play games with for at least the next 4 years, and I found the [url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834246328&#39;]Lenovo IdeaPad Z575[/url]. Can anyone tell me from experience or from looking at the specs if this thing will be able to do what I want it to?</description>

            <p>Well if you <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> portability then I guess there is no avoiding the laptop.<br>
This is the reason I bought my laptop 4 years back.  I was moving countries and just needed something to do work on and watch movies.  And thus I failed and bought a laptop with an Mobile Intel® 4 ShitChipset and found that I couldn’t run anything made post-1990.</p>

            <p>Doesn’t change the fact that I need the portability, and a self-built desktop + shitty laptop combo is just too expensive for me atm. I’d be spending the same amount of money on the desktop (if I’m going to build one, I’m not going to build something that will need to be upgraded within a couple years), and then there’s the cost of the laptop on top of that. Not to mention I’d need to buy windows, since this PC is an OEM and has vista. Getting a laptop is cheaper and simpler right now, and while I know I’ll be wishing I had a desktop with me in a couple years, the one I’m looking at will handle most of what I throw at it. I can abstain from new releases for a couple of years, I have been with this thing for a while now.</p>

            <p>4 years down the line you’ll be gagging for a new machine. My 4 year old laptop just died, but I’ve been using a self built tower for over 2 years. If that laptop was still my gaming machine I’d be crying.</p>

            <p>Well it’s not an entirely lost cause. The guy is heading into a job as a professional 3D modeler abroad, with the automotive company KTM. So he’ll be using it for personal  projects, most likely rendering with the tasty i7 nestled inside it. And with your own hardware you become infinitely more attractive as a freelancer too.</p>
<p>But yes…the lack of gaming is still disappointing  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>lol.</p>
<p>If you’re gonna be playing a game like BF3, you need to be at a desk or table of some sort, and then you might as well be using a desktop pc, but I guess if you plug in a good mouse, and the keyboard on the laptop is half decent, that would be ok.</p>
<p>I remember buying a laptop thinking I would be able to efficiently play WoW while lying on my bed, (I can barely do that sitting up).</p>

            <p>I have an <a href="https://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Laptops/HP-Pavilion/A1M39AV?HP-Pavilion-dv6z-6c00-Quad-Edition-Entertainment-Notebook-PC" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HP dv6z</a>, and it has almost exactly the same specs as the z575.  Same processor, same amount of RAM and a graphics card just a little worse than than the z575.  I haven’t tried running BF3 but i can run Crysis on medium/low settings very smoothly.  IMO it is a very good gaming computer for the price and you should be able to run anything you want as long as you tweak the settings right.</p>
<p>UPDATE:<br>
I just ran my computer through <a href="http://canyourunit.com" rel="nofollow noopener">canyourunit.com</a> for BF3 and it came back that i am above minimum system requirements but below recommended.  In my experience, that means that you can run it on low.</p>
