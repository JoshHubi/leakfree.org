    <description>Speakers: Logitech x-540 

Onboard sound: Realtek HD audio, it supports 7.1, but not sure on the tech details of the chip.

Ok, i was wondering, if i get a new and better sound card will i see much of a difference if sound quality? The speakers are great, but i just think they could do more. 

Can anyone recomend any cards?  I&#39;ll spend about $100, but there isn&#39;t much point if i&#39;ll only notice a tiny increase. Thoughts?

            <p>Right now, for instance, i’m listing to In Flames - Man Made god.</p>
<p>Now, the two rear sats aren’t outputting that loud with decent quality, but if i’m on a true 5.1, there fine. So i’m gonna put it down to the soundcard. I think. Haha.</p>

            <p>The X-Fi is much better at upmixing stereo sound to 5.1, it has a feature called CMSS-3D for doing that. It generally separates out the really wide stereo stuff to the satellite speakers; I find it works well for me. YMMV, of course.</p>

            <p>I might have a look at an XFi card then.</p>
<p>When i force souround sound on these speakers on a 2 channel source (I.E using the matrix button) I notice that on some of the real speakers, the sound is reall flaky and distorted. Its even worse if i use the force 5.1 in the realtek software.</p>
<p>When i try a true 5.1 source, like saving private ryan on DVD, the sound is amazing. Do you have any of the same issues?</p>

            <p>I have an X-Fi, but that’s mainly so I can continue to have proper 3D sound with old DirectSound-based games on Vista. The audio quality is good (I have the same speakers) but I don’t know how it compares to a Realtek chipset. One thing I would say about Creative cards is that they’re mostly very good but the Vista drivers were a bit flaky for a long time. It all seems to be sorted now though.</p>
