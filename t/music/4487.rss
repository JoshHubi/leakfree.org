            <p>Hey, most of the time the annoying grating sound holds a purpose (it’s not in every song, though it <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> heavily featured in <span class="bbcode-i">10,000 Days</span>).  For example, “Rosetta Stoned” is supposedly the retelling of one man’s acid trip, but it’s one huge metaphor for Scientology.  Not only does the unsettled guitar part give the song an off-kilter stoned feeling, it also lends a hand to the intended meaning and is symbolic of how annoying and grating Scientologists are.</p>

            <p>Adam Jones has a unique method to his guitar playing.  It doesn’t focus on solos or tight riffs.  It focuses heavily on distortion and an almost whiney siren sound.  Some call it annoying and grating.  I call it experimental, different, and artisitc.</p>

            <p>I’ve heard that from a lot of people, and I can see where you are coming from.</p>
<p>But I personally like the artsie direction they took with <span class="bbcode-i">Lateralus</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">10,000 Days</span>.  The best description I can give is riding a Chinese dragon through rings of fire centered in a forest lined with a flowing river and pressurized with metaphor.  Tool’s music takes you on a journey you hope never ends (which is good, since their pieces are generally longer than your usual music).  Of the all their albums, I think <span class="bbcode-i">Lateralus</span> succeeded most in this area, as all the music was connected by some type of feeling I have trouble explaining (I hesitate to say “theme” since it was technicaly not a concept album), even though none of my favorite tracks from them are on there.</p>
<p>And Maynard James Keenan?  The man is my equivalent to God.  I have yet to hear something he doen’t sound angelic in (whether it’s in Tool or not).</p>
<p>And let’s not even touch the lyrical genius.</p>

            <p>I haven’t liked much of their music since Aenema. It sounds like it is building to something, and then it doesn’t go anywhere, and I end up disappointed. I feel like they could do so much better if they tried just a little harder to be a rock band, and stopped being so artsie.</p>

            <p>While they do have a similar setup, their sound is metal through and through. Even with the rapping parts. The crunching fast played guitars, the rough and growly vocals (for the most part), and the thundering, pounding percussion see to that. I don’t categorize bands by their setup. I categorize by sound. Slipknot sound metal. While they do share a similarity with Korn, they take it so much further. It’s nowhere near nu, it’s metal.</p>

            <p>Damn, I forgot Limp Bizkit…</p>
<p>But yeah, Slipknot is nu-metal, the vocals are based more on rhythm/rap than anything else, and it takes a great deal of inspiration for it’s guitar parts from Korn, where they’re just basically mostly background noise, with little solos.  It’s there for effect.</p>
<p>Granted <span class="bbcode-i">All Hope Is Lost</span> took a step away from nu-metal, but listen to their first three albums, and you’ll see a lot of rap/hip-hop inspired pieces, including “No Life,” “Spit it Out,” “Liberate,” “Disasterpiece,” “People = Shit,” “Heretic Anthem,” “My Plague,” “Three Nil,” and “Welcome.”  The rapping defines them as nu-metal, as well as the way the guitars are more background than anything.  Hell, even the screaming in their other pieces is rhythmic, rapid-fire, and rap in nature.</p>
<p>And their creepy ambient pieces, such as “Prosthetics,” are definitely NOT pure metal.</p>
<p>Plus they have a turntable and dedicated sample artist (who’s kinda useless on tour and in concert…).</p>

            <p>Slipknot is just straight-up metal. There is nothing “nu” about them. The term fits better for Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit. I honestly don’t know how Slipknot keeps getting tossed in the mix with those other bands…</p>

<p>Pro-Tip: There are a lot less nu-metal bands than you probably think exist.  It’s that genre that’s thrown around <span class="bbcode-i">just cause</span>.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, I can only think of a few pure nu-metal bands: Korn, Slipknot, and P.O.D.</p>
<p>Disturbed’s first album was sorta nu-metal and Linkin Park is nu-metal some of the time.</p>

<p>I like Korock and Royal Gregory, but both LP and the S/T are 10/10<br>
Latin is less raw than those two.</p>

but yeah I listen to sludge and… POST-metal. Drone is sometimes lumped with metal.<br>
Also fuck off for riffing on grindcore, listen to some Phantomsmasher.</p>

            <p>If anybody actually bothered to read the tab books on amazing albums like <span class="bbcode-i">Ashes of the Wake</span>, <span class="bbcode-i">Toxicity</span>, <span class="bbcode-i">Untouchables </span> or<span class="bbcode-i">Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam</span>, or bother to take months of vocal training to sing even a single one of those or let out a cathartic yawp, you’d probably see that Metal is a genre full of different regional scenes and vastly different sub-genres that has been evolving for years since the down-tuning of Jimmy Hendrix’s guitar or the likes of Black Sabbath and is one of the most complex genres out there, perhaps too diverse to even be called a genre, but one unified as a manner to creatively express the anger many feel on topics everyone knows such as the Iraq War (<span class="bbcode-i">Now You’ve Got Something to Die For</span>, etc.), or religious establishment (every black metal band ever). Whatever you fucking do though, don’t ever say metal isn’t music. Even half-assed Grindcore is music, although I could easily mimic the noise of that genre if I were to run myself over with a lawn mower as a friend drummed blast beats and another played a drop-C  guitar.</p>

<p>I get that feeling with songs that aren’t metal, so your point is moot.</p>
