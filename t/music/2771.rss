            <p>The “internet sharing” and “file sharing” you mention -is- piracy. The moment you send and/or receive music from or to other people, you’re a pirate. It’s simple as that.</p>
<p>Yes, music should be available for free so people can get the best for their money, but that way isn’t through sharing it with others. It’s through the methods I mentioned in my previous post (and the old school ways of playing mall gigs or release parties).</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s funny, I never even mentioned piracy. In fact you’re completely wrong in your character assessment there, I don’t believe piracy is the best thing that can happen to the music business. I was pointing out that it’s something that has always been there, even before the internet. If you read again you might see that I was mainly pointing out that the internet is free from the monopolization that is present in television and radio.</p>
<p>All of my CDs are genuine and bought with my hard earned money. I’m just one of those people who wants to get the best for their money. Most music I buy I’ve already downloaded and listened to via peer 2 peer beforehand. That way I know what I’m paying for and that what I’m paying for is worth paying for. The same rule of thumb applies to movies I buy, I only buy movies I’ve seen already, that way I know they’re good. Of course I don’t pirate movies, I borrow them from people or watch them on television or at the cinema. If they’re worth buying, I buy them.</p>
<p>You strike me as the kind of person who engages in heated arguments in youtube comments.</p>
<p>Read more carefully and don’t make assumptions.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Music is freely accessible. Fucktons of artists already put previews of their new albums (through flashplayers (like MySpace) or 30 second previews) on their website or YouTube. Listening to those things is my way of checking out a new band or new album, so I just go and buy the album if I like what I hear. So that argument is not a reason to justify piracy… Not even close. Also, in case you haven’t noticed, a lot of entertainment- and musicstores offer some form of service that allows you to preview an album… So yea, your point is moot… Very moot.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>See my previous. Artists and labels are already using the internet to freely distribute their music onto the public by means of preview. So they already use this as a great marketing tool. But what you’re saying makes no sense, again. Sure, bands can get attention and become popular a lot easier due to the internet, however, what’s the point of getting signed and releasing proper albums, when you can’t make a decent living out of it.</p>

Outside of the internet you’re only free to discover whatever easily marketable popular music that monsterous record labels like Sony and Warner Bros want you to.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well… for this as well, see my first point. You have your free music on the internet, you have the exposure because your music is on the internet, you can get acknowledged by getting your music on the internet. However! Free music ≠ p2p piracy of music. I, for one, think that the current system a lot of bands use (the previews/flashplayer thing) is just great. I’ve discovered a lot of bands this way and got to know some really good music… All without piracy. And if there’s artists and/or labels stuck up enough to not get previews and flashplayers out, then so be it, their loss…</p>
<p>I have no idea why I just wrote this down, because you seem to be the kind of guy that believes piracy is the best thing that can happen to the music business and that you just want their product for free, so this post won’t open your eyes anyway.</p>

<p>can understand peer to peer sharing is wrong cuz you are accessing something that is not freely available on the internet but instead a direct link to someones puter.  This I dont do.

            <p>Well that is the thing. I do own the music in vinyl version.  I assume this offers me the right to get it also in mp3, but is this thinking wrong?   :s hrug:</p>

<p>You bring up a very valid point ram and to be honest I am kinda clueless on what exactly is right or wrong on this.  At what point is it stealing or not stealing?  I can understand peer to peer sharing is wrong cuz you are accessing something that is not freely available on the internet but instead a direct link to someones puter.  This I dont do.  But what about when the songs are there on the net for download for free without a membership or without paying for it?  Sites like mp3raid, or bomb-mp3, or a dozen others.  If it is stealing then why are these sites up and running? Wouldn’t they be shut down for illegal activity? And what if I have all of the albums? Does that give me a special right to be able to download them from open sites such as those? Technically haven’t I already purchased a right to own it?</p>
<p>This is an honest question, and I wont mind honest answers.</p>

<p>Peer to peer is no different than downloading it from a website. If you’re downloading music (from anywhere) that you haven’t purchased, it’s ‘stealing’ (not in the strictest sense, but whatever), and so shouldn’t be done if you think it’s wrong.<br>
Unless it’s music that isn’t protected by copyright, of course.</p>
<p>If you own the music already, there’s nothing wrong with downloading it.</p>

            <p>I wonder… Why are you looking for Christian music in specific?</p>
<p>Surely, random rock songs about love and sadness etc are as good as random rock songs about Jesus H. Christ?</p>
<p>I can understand you not wanting to listen to the “roar the devil is a cool dude” metal, but stuff like Stevie Ray Vaughan and Fats Domino aren’t christian in theme, but are decent songs anyways.</p>
<p>Also: Christian Death Metal (lol)<br>
