    <description>Hey, my Steam copy seems to crash at launch. The screen goes black for a few seconds, and then I get sent back to the desktop. There seems to be no dump report created, and I&#39;ve tried re-installing, verifying game cache, and putting -windowed in the property settings. Not too sure what to do from here.</description>
