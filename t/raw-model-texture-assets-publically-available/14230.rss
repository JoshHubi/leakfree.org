    <title>Raw Model/Texture Assets Publically Available?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/raw-model-texture-assets-publically-available/14230</link>
    <description>Particularly looking for the smd/dmx/QC files for the face creation system, and the weapon view model arms. Are these (and/or any other pre-compile model files) available for public download/use? Would rather get them from the source than try to decompile things and hope they work right.

Would also be a big help to see how you guys make your textures with their raw files as well, help ensure things I make fit Black Mesa&#39;s style.

Anything you would be willing to part with would be greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>Not as of yet. It’s a logistical and legal obstacle.</p>
<p>Bard was talking about this a while back. The folder containing the source files for the Tau’s textures totals 4GB in size. Yikes!</p>
