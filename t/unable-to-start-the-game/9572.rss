    <title>Unable to start the game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unable-to-start-the-game/9572</link>
    <description>I downloaded blackmesa and at first everything worked fine. But since I easily get headaches and become nauseated from games with head bobbing and motion blur,  I wanted to see if I could turn it of and at the same time I increased the resolution.
After this, the screen went black as it usually does when u change the resolution of a game, but this stayed so I had to ctrl+alt+del and terminate the process.
I didn&#39;t think there was anymore to it and that i just had to keep playing on the lower resolution but now when i try to boot the game again it just closes as fast as I run it. help please :x</description>
