    <description>Hello! ¡ Hola! Salut! Shalom!

Black Mesa is looking for help in translating our script so that everybody across the globe can enjoy the story as well as the action.

Which one of you fine polyglots will step up to the challenge?

We will send you our .txt file upon acceptance, and we will gladly GIFT you a copy of the game after completion of your translation duties.

Thanks for all your support! The game would not have been possible without the amazing dedication from this community.</description>

            <p>So Xen probably needs translating too, right?<br>
If you want day 1 translations when the real Xen Update is out, it would amazing if the text files won’t reach the translators 3 days before launch.</p>

<p>I’m not sure they take any more volonteers but It’s worthing to ask.<br>
Don’t take attention to files in the old version… these translations were done very quickly in less than 24 hours… Which explains the massive use of Google Translate…</p>

Oh, that’s why then… Yeah, I spoke with the moderator of the portuguese subforum and he said that they were already with a team, so I decided to do it myself just for fun and to improve my english. I’m correcting and adapting the majority of lines that were released back in 2012, and making a simple mod to override temporarily the english version to portuguese. Until the Dev Team make the propper corrections to the files we can translate, like gameui and gameui_loading_screen.</p>
<p>This is my progress, if anyone is interested:</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m willing to translate Black Mesa to PT-BR (Brazilian Portuguese) ! Including CC, UI, MP, HEV Boot, etc (as provided in misc.vpk) I have plenty of time to work on the translations !</p>
<p>Here’s a sample:</p>
<p>“Tips”<br>
{</p>
<p>// En:<br>
“Glock Alternate Fire”<br>
{<br>
“description” “Alt-firing (right clicking) with the Glock doubles its fire rate, but is 6x less accurate. It should only ever be used at very close range.”<br>
}</p>
<p>// Pt-br<br>
“Disparo Alternativo da Glock”<br>
{<br>
“description” “Usar o modo de disparo alternativo da Glock (botão direito do mouse) dobra a taxa de disparo, porém é 6x mais imprecisa. Deve ser usada somente quando estiver muito próximo ao inimigo.”<br>
}<br>
}</p>

<p>Alright then, seems like there was a big issue about it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-s">Well, too bad, I wanted to be credited  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> .</span> just kiddin<br>
[/size]<br>
It’s still rather weird though that you need to use that separate website instead of simply posting here, but I guess Crowbar Collective have their own ways.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To clear things up: The developers never had the intention or did work on a translation (at least for the past free mod, correct me if I’m wrong) themselves, so a bunch of ambitious people, led by Jokerine, came together. They wanted translations badly and so decided to do them themselves. Because it was difficult or rather counterproductive to do so on these forums, a new forum was created. It’s a lot faster to communicate problems, fixes, suggestions etc. on an own forum instead of wooling through new posts or having 100 + people commenting on your every single translation here. A nice, private space, just for the volunteers, seemed more appropriate. So no, Crowbar Collective wasn’t in any part involved or active in the translations or on these “new” forums.<br>
For the Credit part: If you want to help translating, go to the forums, ask your fellow countrymen and become involved. If  Not all of the translators were credited in the first BM release either. To elaborate on this: The Black Mesa Dev’s as well as the translation teams never had any “fixed” members. People come and people go, that’s just Life. The communications between us translators and the Dev’s was mainly through Jokerine. To credit the translators in the first BM release was a nice way of showing appreciation to those active on the translations in the past. It’s up to the Dev’s if they want to include you or more future translators in the Credits of the Steam Retail.</p>

            <p>Alright then, seems like there was a big issue about it.</p>

It’s still rather weird though that you need to use that separate website instead of simply posting here, but I guess Crowbar Collective have their own ways.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for other languages, but we of the Italian team (2 translators) normally handle the Steam Translation Server’s translations (Dota 2, Steam, etc.), and we often also deal with outside projects (ex. Shadow Warrior), so not only we have the experience, but we also have people at Valve that can confirm such experience for us.</p>
<p>I know that a few of the teams are handled by fellow STS people, which should at the very least show a certain bar their quality.</p>

            <p>Yea, just to clear things up.</p>
<p>Jokerine is the lead of the current and long-standing translating team, if you’re interested in helping translate, please chat with them!</p>
<p>As Jokerine also pointed out, the updated captioning for the game isn’t ready yet, it’ll be ready within the next few months when the developer who is updated the english subs finishes up with the work.</p>
<p>Sorry for the miscommunication, something must’ve got … lost in translation. (Don’t shoot me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  )</p>

            <p>Ok, there’s something that needs clarification on that matter.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Translators are welcome.</span></span></p>
<p>“We”, as in the “The translators who are at work since 2011-2012”, just feel a little cheated.</p>
<p>If you want to translate:<br>
Go to <a href="https://bmtranslate.darkbb.com/f1-translation-subforums" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://bmtranslate.darkbb.com/f1-translation-subforums</a><br>
and look if the language you want to translate is already there.</p>
<p>Is the language you want to translate already there?</p>
<ul>
<li>yes - then just click on that and ask if you can join.</li>
<li>no - you can make a post here <a href="https://bmtranslate.darkbb.com/t13-applying-to-translate-updated" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://bmtranslate.darkbb.com/t13-applying-to-translate-updated</a> and just become the first to translate for your language.</li>
<li>yes, and it has a [√] in front of the name. Those language were already finished once, but you can still join them and help improve.</li>

<p>Okay, what? Yeah, sorry, but I am sort of managing the translations myself and we really need more clarification on this. I was told by Kevin Sisk that we’d be given the closed captioning files in a few months probably (would take a while, he said) and Joe Radak confirmed this. Just a few days ago we were discussing this very issue. And now, what? Like, what?</p>
<p>Are you looking for a whole team of new translators, or volunteers for languages that are not being translated yet? We really need clarification on this issue. I would rather not jump to conclusions, but if you’re going to look for a whole new team without even notifying us… well, that would be, like, super lame, considering how hard we worked on the first release with you guys and how long we’ve all been waiting for news about the new closed captioning file.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Pretty much so.</p>
<p>I  certainly don’t understand your current procedures. It seems that either<br>
a) you don’t know yourselves where you want to take things with the translation<br>
b) you Devs have internal communication problems<br>
c)  you have clearly problems communicating your plans and issues to the community</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m totally okay if you look for whole new translators, whether you think the first one sucked or you want to open the field of available translators, but us (first) volunteering translators waiting so long for a update on this issue and not getting any information until recently, we just feel a little bit cheated.</p>
<p>I mean we all gladly want to help, even without the nice gift you’ll be giving /have given to us (on my behalf, at least, thanks again for that !), but the way you are handling things now isn’t exactly the best to build confidence and work  together on equal footing.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We are working with Black Mesa Team since 2012, they even give us last Thursday Black Mesa Steam Keys to work with…<br>
Most of the translation are done but not implemented, that’s why you don’t see it on Steam neither in the files.<br>
For example, Xen is not in the files, that doesn’t mean nothing have been done…</p>
<p>Concerned translators will confirm but the actual German, Italian, Spanish, Norwegian and Finnish translations were done in 24/48 hours before the 2012 release.<br>
The translations are, in a result, not very good and were not tested in-game.<br>
That’s why we work months on good translations at the end of 2012 for every languages.<br>
We said “We” because we are considered official translation team of Black Mesa. We know the project and considering closecaptions, we know the bugs and we know the tasks to do.</p>
<p>For example, concerning French, the translation for the 2012 mod was 100% done.  Since the Steam release, they fixed a lot of bugs we pointed at and add some dialogs. If they fixed remaining bugs, we might have finished the translation in a few weeks.</p>
<p>The problem in every project, and here we have a good example, is communication. We had no informations for a long time or very few. That’s because, as you said, we are not part of the Crowbar Collective and they can’t give us too much informations.<br>
The frustration you saw upper is just we are scared that they forget about us despite the months of work we’ve done.</p>
<p>I hope someone from the Dev Team will clarify this situation.</p>

<p>Yes, it was done, and yes, you are unaware of what is going on.</p>
<p>He is (and we are) part of an OFFICIAL project, where the developers themselves sent us the proper translation files before the initial release. We did that, however, the Steam release captions uses a modified version, and they didn’t update us beforehand, so our work couldn’t be pushed to Steam. We are currently waiting for the new version, to update the translations and roll in a future update.</p>
