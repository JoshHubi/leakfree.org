    <description>Global Operations is a team-based first-person shooter that places you with spec-ops forces, guerilla, terrorist, and other groups as well. It is also multiplayer and is sort of similar to Counter-Strike. It came out way back in 2002. Ever played it? I found it to be pretty enjoyable. Someone tried to remake it on source, but being the nubs they are, they didn&#39;t finish.</description>
