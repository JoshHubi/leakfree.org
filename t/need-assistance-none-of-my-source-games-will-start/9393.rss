    <title>Need assistance - none of my Source games will start...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-assistance-none-of-my-source-games-will-start/9393</link>
    <description>...Including Source SDK Base 2007...

I&#39;ve uninstalled the games. I&#39;ve nuked the folders that they were in. I&#39;ve verified game cache. I&#39;ve defragged the games. I&#39;ve tried compatibility. I&#39;ve tried the following launch options: -32bit -autoconfig -novid. Nothing has worked. 

My Source games ran fine a year ago, but for some reason have stopped working. The &#39;Preparing to launch&#39; menu DOES appear, and the PROCESS shows up in the task manager, but nothing launches and eventually the process ends.

I haven&#39;t tried reinstalling Steam yet because I&#39;ve been holding out for another solution. Google searching and the Steam forums have not been helpful. I came here hoping that maybe someone here would have a solution.

Thanks to anyone who can provide assistance  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>Heisenberg might be onto something, though. I recommend using a full system scan with Malwarebytes’ Anti-Malware software.</p>

            <p>One day one of my mods decided to stop working, Goldeneye: Source, a Steam thread suggested updating and running HL2, and then try running the mod, this fixed it.</p>

            <p>Can you let me know of any recent changes? Maybe you have a conflict with something installed recently. Have you installed any rogue applications or bloatware? If you want us to help we need a bit more information about your system. How long ago did this issue arise a month? Surely you have played something withing the span of a year!</p>

            <p>I dunno how to fix it but I’m sure that if you aren’t getting an answer here, the Steam forums should be able to assist.  In fact, I suggest, if you haven’t done it already, post over there. Steam developers might even respond.</p>

<p>Before reinstalling Steam, try with uninstalling said game you’re trying to launch. And by delete I mean first deleting it on Steam and then go into the steamapps folder and delete whatever rests of the game Steam might’ve left. If that doesn’t work… Yeah, reinstall Steam.</p>

<p>Welp, nuking steam did nothing. No Source games will run after complete nuke and reinstall. Any other ideas? :S</p>

            <p>Try deleting clientregistry.blob from the main Steam folder, that usually fixes most errors.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work, all I can suggest is unfortunately reinstall Steam.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
