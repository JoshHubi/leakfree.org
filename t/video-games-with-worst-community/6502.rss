    <description>Self-explaining thread.
I&#39;ll start by saying CoD Black Ops, I haven&#39;t and won&#39;t play it, but the reason that is would be because the large majority of the players (atleast the ones I&#39;ve seen/met) think all other games are inferior, and are complete shit. I have an example that gave me an idea for this, too, I was wearing a Portal 2 shirt, and one kid (who everyone hates because he&#39;s a lying, cheating, and stealing idiot) walked up, and he uused his trademark, high IQ insult of &quot;Faggot&quot; and said the game sucked, I asked him if he had even played Portal 2, and he, being a liar, cheater, etc. of course said yes, So i called bullshit, and he, being a idiot decided to say, &quot;I&#39;m a game tester&quot; Despite being unable to name the release or the company thats making it (valve, of course) and the fact that it&#39;s incredibly unlikely seeing as we live in Indiana. I&#39;m not just ranting about some random idiot, he is an avid black ops player, and someone else is talking about a videogame, he interjects and calls it shit. Even if your talking about something that he hasn&#39;t probably even heard of like Contra, he interjected when a few of my friends were talking about it, and did his thing.

Well so far this has been almost half rant, but oh well, any ways post any games that you think have a bad reputation becuase of it&#39;s shit community, or a game with a shit community in general, and if you want to, examples.
(If someone else has already created a thread like this, tell me, and I&#39;ll remove it seems like something that would have already been made, but I couldn&#39;t find anything, so I went ahead)

tl;dr
post games with shit communities
EDIT: Back to lurking then, I&#39;ll come back to this eventually incase this actually gets something done.</description>

<p>L4D 1 &amp; 2 choose who you play with based on how you do in the game. If you’re good, you get put with good people. If you suck ass, or always take medkits and heal yourself, you get put with such people. (Gabe talks about this in dev commentary for L4D2.)</p>
<p>So technically the community you perceive the game to have is actually a reflection of yourself, and your own inability to cooperate…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Bull shit, I always play support - I help others on the team before myself, I have good trigger discipline, I rarely rush levels (lest there be good reason to do otherwise), I usually have the highest stats (except for ‘damage taken’ and ‘health/pills used’) and I usually give directions and such to the newbs. I’m usually also the most patient.</p>
<p>I only ragequit in <span class="bbcode-i">completely</span> hopeless cases.</p>
<p>Granted, I admit I’m not the best, or even within any circle of “elite” players, but I’m confident enough to say I’m good enough for most groups.</p>
<p>Continuous wipes of the first level while one idiots mic spams carameldansen, with another constantly searching for grenades for the sole purpose of throwing them with another idiot rushing ahead calling everyone else a faggot, while I’m trying to organize and help everyone else is <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> my fault. Hell, if you’re telling me you wouldn’t ragequit after half an hour of such a scenario, I’d call you a liar, and a bad one at that.</p>
<p>/rant. Yeah I admit, this struck a nerve.</p>
<p>To note, I usually hit ‘quickmatch’, allowing random chance to put me in a random scenario - most of which I usually do well in.</p>

            <p>That’s why I always preferred Battlefield to Call of Duty. Especially Bad Company 2, because you’re rewarded for helping your teammates in combat. And there is NOTHING in this world quite like a match in Battlefield 2 where everyone is in squads, using microphones, and you have a competent commander and everyone’s working together. It’s just absolutely beautiful.</p>

            <p>COD’s community IS the definitive worst though. It’s popular status has made it a sort of douchebag magnet. Monster/ Rockstar chugging fat white dudes with soul patches, jerseys, backwards caps, and a love for Blink 182 just can’t get enough of having the “hot new thing”.</p>
<p>Halo was that for a bit when H2 came out and it carried over to H3. These creatures can’t be satisfied by a game that only gets sequels released once every 3 years though. They need an annual douchathon. COD is that douchathon. I mean It comes out once a year, it’s got “ZOMG SO REALISTIC BROWN BLOOM GRAFIXXXXX”, it’s got a gameplay style that encourages you to be a complete fuckass to absolutely EVERYONE (even your teammates) by offering NO mutual gratification, AND it’s got constant backing of hacks like eminem (the douche’s lure) in the commercials.</p>
<p>COD is the perfect douchebag game.</p>

<p>I’ve always had a fascination with psychology, and it just interests me what causes such fetishes. Don’t have any ability to work it out, but I can wonder.</p>
<p>Meh, we should probably return to topic. I have to declare that CoD is worst when today I heard a person claiming that the phrase “rage quit” originated from it. I don’t care if I’m extrapolating one person’s views into an entire group, it was just that bad.</p>

            <p>I’ll just be blunt. Your fetishes don’t make logical sense to me, psychologically. I just can’t see what would inspire them. Doesn’t really matter, but it doesn’t fit into the view that these things are caused by some psychological factor. Meh, I’ll never know.</p>

<p>Halo has better visuals, though. Probably the least <span class="bbcode-i">brown</span> game franchise of the past 10 years.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Uncharted, Mafia, hell, even Bulletstorm has a shitload of color in it. They do the whole trick of leading you through brown for 10-15 minutes and then just throwing a huge, colorful vista at you. It’s beautiful.</p>

<p>Hey, we’re at least better than the guys over on the MyCrysis forums.</p>

<p>LOL CRYSIS HAS TEH BEST STORYLIEN AN DA VOIS ACTING IZZ SOO GUUD IT MAED ME CRIE.</p>
<hr>
<p>The largest collection of assoles (besides COD) is the CounterStrike community.</p>
<p>Second largest is the l4d (1, not 2) community. You see, because everyone that protested l4d 2 were a bunch of uptight humorless cock sucking bitches. When l4d2 came out all the fun people played that and all the assholes are playing l4d1.</p>
<p>It’s a shame too, because I do like l4d1 better than 2, but it’s just 98% tryhards over there. I can only play it with a full party of friends.</p>
<p>Also, speaking of tryhards… Armagetron has a pretty bad community. Most of you haven’t heard of it but it’s a free lightcycle battle game. Biggest collection of tryhard assholes on the planet too. I shit you not. The actual game is pretty decent though. The creator found a way to make a LC game actually playable by a human and not a robot with tourettes.</p>
<p>Halo’s community, while annoying, is perfectly benign. Especially now that all the fad humpers that played it before (like the one mentioned in the OP) all switched to COD.<br>
Actually the community in reach is considerably more enjoyable than Halo 3 because of the same set of events that split the l4d community. Long running fans couldn’t take the changes and got all crabby and started playing the shit out of the older title, making it damn near impossible to find a decent teammate because the moment you start up a game it’s just nothing but a bunch of crabby assholes who fear change.</p>
<p>Edit: I read Gears mentioned in the thread… It’s kinda complicated with them. I mean the online versus part of the community is fucking terrible but the coop community is awesome. They’re split about 50/50 too.</p>

<p>Thank you, and I can safely say the same to you</p>
<p>As for bad video game communities, I think I’ll mention the forums behind the PSP homebrew game CSPSP. I’m an active member there under the same username, and if you look at <a href="https://s4.zetaboards.com/CSPSP/index/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">their forums</a> you should be able to tell that its not exactly filled with great and interesting posts/members.</p>
<p>EDIT: There’s actually several threads about the state of the community in the off-topic section of the forums linked above, if you care to read</p>

<p>That’s a good one.</p>
<p>On a side note, I think the original quake 1 has one of the best communities in existence. Probably because of it’s old age and small size.</p>
