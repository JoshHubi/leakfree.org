    <description>Discuss Israel and Palestine, who&#39;s right, should they have gotten their own country, was that the right place for it etc.

This is a subject I know very little about so I&#39;m going to sit and watch the shitstorm this time  :stuck_out_tongue: .</description>

            <p>Ah - OK.  Thanks for making that clear I understand the meaning of your C&amp;P clearly now.</p>
<p>Your proposition is that the Jews are at fault for the situation in the Middle East because they started it. And you support this proposition with … The Bible.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>I’m happy we cleared that up, and as a gesture of resolution, I’ll join you in your internet forum debate cliches - what is that thing you crazy kids do?  Oh, right:</p>
<p>I’m just gonna leave this here:</p>

            <p>You deleted it in your response to me.  When you quoted me, you quoted me out of context, snipping out the reasoning, then snarked at not having reasoning.</p>
<p>And how it applies to today is that it’s tit for tat (and sometimes tit for two tats) shit.  Israel does something, Palestine responds, Israel responds, Palestine responds…ever escalating the violence.  It begins with someone being snippy, then someone retaliating then other side retaliating for the retaliation.</p>
<p>Originally, if the Bible is to be believed, those entering the Land of Canaan (that is, invading Canaan) drew first blood, as it were.  Who are the “first blood” drawers, according to the Bible?  The Israelis.  If we’re looking for fault, it lies there.</p>
<p>Both, however, are at massive fault for being immature children with weapons where real lives are at stake.  I’m not on either’s side.  I was just pointing out that Israel started this shit ages ago.</p>

<p>I don’t really have time right now to respond in any real way, but I’ll tell you this - I guess you might have to dumb it down even more for me, because I still don’t understand the point. I don’t understand how this is relevant at all to the Palestinian Problem or the Contemporary Middle-East region - I don’t see how it fits the context of the discussion.</p>
<p>Also, you keep saying that I deleted something, but I didn’t delete anything. I don’t know who you think I am, but I don’t have the power to alter anyone’s posts, and I wouldn’t even if I could.</p>

            <p>Sheesh.  My point (that you deleted) is that the Bible stated that they invaded the land we now know as Israel/Palestine, kicked out (or killed) all the people, destroyed their instrumentations of worship, and then divvied the land up to the invaders.  And the reason that was okay was that some evidence of child sacrifice was found.  Overkill much?  How much more simple can I make it?  Should I use Adventures of Dick and Jane to explain it like I would to a kindergartener?  :tired:</p>
<p>But, like I said, this is all academic.  Now Israel is stating that they have a right to the land and they have a right to oppress the Palestinian people.  And the Palestinians say they have a right to the same land and they have a right to attack the Israelis.</p>
<p>Girls, girls, you’re both pretty.  Can you both give it a rest?</p>

            <p>Whether or not Israel should have been created in 1948 is irrelevant, because as of right now it IS a legal state, and for that reason the Israelis have a right to fight for it. Legally speaking, Israel is in the right, and those trying to win the land back are in the wrong. Now, morally speaking, it’s pretty clear what your opinions are on that matter… but that is all they are: opinions.</p>
