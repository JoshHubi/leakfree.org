    <description>Has anyone bought it yet?  I think I&#39;m going to buy it later tonight when I get a chance.  I decided to wait on playing the first after I saw how awesome this one was looking.  From what I&#39;ve seen of it, this is probably going to be the best Source game graphically to be released as of yet.  That&#39;s beside the fact that it has such a unique story and game-play.</description>

            <p>There are 3 sightings of a ghost person. The original had 4.<br>
Spoilers:<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]At the beginning of map 2 you can see her going the left pathway. You can’t see her though if you look directly at her. The second sighting is at the part where you walk up to the broken house of jacobson. It’s standing in front of the door. The third sigting is at the last map on the hill.</p>

<p>I’ve been on Facebook too much and wanted to like this. Couldn’t agree more and I’m surprised the argument has come up more than once.</p>

</aside>
<p>I loved that about the game, I think I saw three or four in total. The maker has got a good eye for predicting and subtly controlling where the player’s view will be for a certain amount of time, and putting something small but noticeable in to further draw you into the atmosphere. It was brilliantly done.</p>
<p>Although ultimately I’m disappointed by the lack of exploration or interaction, I do think the care and craft that went into the product is apparent throughout and exceeds any other game I can think of. Even the dead ends were filled with carefully placed items that added clues to the plot.</p>
<p>I do wonder though, whether the lack of interaction was intentional, as though you’re not so much a person as a spirit of some sort wandering the island. The different narrative accounts (such as the letters to Esther and the dying explorer’s writings) as well as the open-ended climax support this, but the fact that you use a torch works against it. It did remind me of the Island in Lost however, due to the fact that dozens of people have been shipwrecked upon it, and the mystical nature of it.</p>

<p>Hey hey now, don’t be mean - I agree with him.</p>
<p>I will fully admit these people are excellent world-artists, and may even be very good poets and storytellers. These are all very noble accomplishments.</p>
<p>However, Dear Esther isn’t really a game. It’s about exploration, sure, but so are many movies. I just think it’s misleading to say it’s excellent game design, when they’ve just excelled at PART of what it takes to make a great game.</p>

            <p>I did have to pirate the game (I feel dirty) but it’s an amazing thing. I did not like the first one much because DAMN THE NARRATOR’S ACCENT GAH! But now, with nice subtitles and all, it’s a lot better. I kinda miss the possibility of using the console to walk permanently, and moving items around. But besides that, the narration gave me the chills, and the scary images that appear if you go underwater too long creeped the hell outta me :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>I would not classify Dear Esther as a game. It consists of holding the W button.<br>
I didn’t even have the patience to listen to the long rants of the talking guy. I entered sv_cheats 1 and noclip in the console and just admired DE’s graphics.</p>

            <p>Saw this admin comment about the game on the wiki page of TheChineseRoom.<br>
This page is one related to the new collaboration between the Amnesia and Dear Esther teams.</p>

I noticed while I was exploring the island, I found a fissure, that reminded me of Myst and Riven, covered by metal grate. It didn’t trigger any speech or event, but I was hoping to know if there was more to it than it seemed. I would love to know.</p>

Can’t possibly let slip anything about that before the new release. But you should check it out when you go back to the island for sure.</p>

<p>So just the graphics then?</p>

<p>Basically just the graphics.  There’s also remastered music and some new dialogue, but it doesn’t add much, save for one line, which [spoiler][color=black]implies that <span class="bbcode-i">Donnelly</span> was the one who was drunk, not Paul.</p>

            <p>Actually, I’d never looked at it that way, and Hyperbytes explanation seems more well rounded than mine. interesting.</p>

<p>sheesh, it was just a question, don’t have to get all defensive about it</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t really see how I came across as defensive. From your other posts it’s obvious that you would have a more categorical view of a game’s benefits than I think is relevant. The only way to communicate that is to explain it, there’s no succinct one sentence answer. That’s not a knock on your intelligence or taste, it’s just a highlight on how people perceive these things very differently.</p>
<p>Actually, I can see how the last sentence could seem defensive. I meant “you don’t have to like it” literally. It was just to emphasize the relativity, not to espouse the youtube attitude of, “if u dont lik it, dont watch it!!!”</p>

<p>That seems to assume that any benefit, concerning taste, that can be had from playing a video game is objective. There’s no measurement for it, it’s entirely conceptual how people interact with it. Definitions are a way of categorizing and dealing with reality so that we can successfully interact with it, they’re not hard and fast realities.</p>
<p>There is no platonic form of video games that all games aspire to. It’s a concept that can’t be solidified. The axiom of what makes a good video game is completely unsubstantiated and so open to being deconstructed by pieces such as Dear Esther.</p>
<p>All in all I think you’re trying to abstract it into pieces when the whole point of the package is for the whole experience. The different visuals change the perception of the poem, music, interactivity etc. and vice versa. I can definitely tell that my experience of the story was different. It may not be easy to quantify that, but I definitely had a totally other experience than playing the original. And I value that beyond any integrity that I feel is owed to an arbitrary definition of “video game”.</p>
<p>So you don’t have to like it or appreciate it. It’s just that there’s no objective case against it.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that they’ll ever get to a universal, objective definition, but one could probable get to one that is at least sensible.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I understand that people want to come to some kind of definite opinion concerning subjective media, and that’s a good thing. It facilitates discussion and growth, I think.</p>
<p>The main thing I’m trying to point out, though, is that the whole “ideal game” comparison is kind of a waste of time. It’s just a matching game with no point. It’s better to work off of the experience of playing the game, the cause and effect relationship. Obviously this game brings up a lot of interesting questions concerning interactivity, social conceptualizations of gaming, as well as its own autonomous narrative. To me, looking at personal reactions to those aspects is more worth while than questioning whether it matches up to an imaginary standard.</p>
<p>That’s ultimately a relative belief too, but I think it’s one that has more tangible results. The perfect game is an isolated idea that doesn’t really effect anything outside of itself. It’s like gaming in a vacuum.</p>
