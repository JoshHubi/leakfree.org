    <title>McCafee SecurityCenter - keep or replace?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mccafee-securitycenter-keep-or-replace/12582</link>
    <description>My sister&#39;s Dell laptop came with McCafee SecurityCenter preinstalled, with a little over a year&#39;s subscription.

I&#39;m wondering if I should remove it and replace it with something else, since all I ever hear about commercial anti virus software is bad things.
I feel like it is slowing down Windows and the internet more than freeware protection would.

If I should replace it, is Avast the best way to go, or is there something better these days?
I don&#39;t use real-time antivirus protection anymore :p</description>

            <p>Okay, so I’ll probably uninstall McAfee and install Avast, unless anyone has any other suggestions.</p>

<p>McAfee is garbage</p>

<p>LOL…</p>
<p>Believe me, I’m not talking about McAfee being a superior product, only that it doesn’t use near the amount of resources that MS does. Personally, I haven’t paid for an anti-virus since the 90s. Every one I’ve used has been free.</p>
<p>No AV program has all the answers for every virus in the world. New ones are invented literally every day. Using a reputable AV along with other tools like WOT, Malwarebytes, ad aware programs and common sense are your best defenses. Advanced tools like ccleaner are also great.</p>

            <p>And compared to something like Avast, is there any real difference as far as you know?</p>
<p>I’m not gonna bother unless it makes a difference, it’s not my own laptop after all <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I’d recommend getting rid of that and install a free AV like Avast or MS Security Essentials.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve had both McAfee and MS Security Essentials and found that MS uses a LOT more resources, and is a much heavier program than McAfee. I’ve found that eliminating MS Security Essentials makes a substantial difference in resource usage.</p>
