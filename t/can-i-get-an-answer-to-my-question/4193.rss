    <title>Can I get an answer to my question?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/can-i-get-an-answer-to-my-question/4193</link>
    <description>Hello. :smiley:  I am new to this forum. But you can see for sure.
I&#39;m actually from China, but currently lives abroad. But it is not Belgium, since you wonder. But due. my bad English, I decided to write up everything in Google Translate. So far it works great, thank you for asking.

But I have also just words in a way played Half Life2! : D
But I have a couple questions for you, thank you for it there.
The thing is that there is a lot of killing and such, and that&#39;s ok. But I have asked myself &quot;what if this really is real people, such as in the movie&quot; Gamer &quot;or similar?&quot; But I see at once that such thoughts are only silly and nonsense. Fortunately I&#39;m up for good at these mills joke. But as the seriousness: Why is not one bad woman throughout the game? If you do not call her Alberta who are with me through half the game, then. She is kind. I think. Maybe she really is evil, but it says nothing about the legend. And thankfully for that, I must point out, otherwise I had also killed her. And women should not kill. So it really answered the question. Funny how things twisting out, or what?

The funniest is really not all killing. I think the most fun in the game is the fact that the fight against things that are not real! It is just the snout witty! But so funny is it does not really. It is a sort of wonder at all the strange things to be found in the world. Take plankton whether that. They are small, tiny, but then eat hamburgers and other stuff and nonsense. It is because quite sad. But, as my mother always said, &quot;one should not cry over milk played,&quot; what now than it means.
So: The question I would ask!
How is it to not play the game?</description>

<p>Hello New to the forum. But you can not protect.<br>
In fact, I am from China but now lives abroad. But not as you think you are in Belgium. But the cause. My bad English, I decided to write all of the Google translation. Works well so far, the question thanks.</p>
<p>However, a few words you can play Half-Life 2. . D<br>
But I have some questions for you.<br>
Why die, I’ll a good thing for people. But I said: “This is a real person” game "as a movie will do, but just useless strange I want to buy. If you want I always plant, Alberta, and have fun, so lucky to read, why half of "Probably me, I have a game the poor women, the symptoms and the South China Sea, but Roh S, think about … the word is hard to say otherwise, I want to kill yourself and kill many women do not have the word of God the answer to a question Thank you, but it is more. Nothing, or what?</p>
<p>It is not unusual murder. The most interesting game and I was a fact, not fear, I think! Only the best day! But this is really interesting. All the strange world of surprises. Plankton, please. They are small but after eating a hamburger, and other devices, and a fool. Because it’s really sad. But as usual, meaning the game my mom crying milk, but all I know, he said.<br>
My question!<br>
What game?</p>

<p>However, some words to play Half Life2. :. D<br>
But since I have a few questions for you.<br>
What happens to die, that’s fine with him. But I said: “It’s a real person, if a film like” game “or what to do? But only want useless and strange thoughts. Read Luckily, because I always joke with plants, Alberta, if you play seriously, why half” game with me as I say, poor women, I think S is likely, but very bad for the symptoms and not say anything … Thank God I must say that otherwise kill themselves are killing women and therefore not many answers to the question, but it is strange. something or what is it?</p>
<p>Strange is not really murder. The most fun game and I think the real facts, not fear! Only brings is amazing! However, this is really interesting. All this strange world is like a surprise. If plankton, please. They are small, but a hamburger and other equipment and stupid after a meal. Because really very sadly. But as usual my mother, will milk the game, which means to cry and I said I should.<br>
Ask my question!<br>
How to play the game?</p>

I’m actually from China, but currently lives abroad. But it is not Belgium, since you wonder. But due. my bad English, I decided to write up everything in Google Translate. So far it works great, thank you for asking.</p>
<p>But I have also just words in a way played Half Life2! : D<br>
But I have a couple questions for you, thank you for it there.<br>
The thing is that there is a lot of killing and such, and that’s ok. But I have asked myself “what if this really is real people, such as in the movie” Gamer “or similar?” But I see at once that such thoughts are only silly and nonsense. Fortunately I’m up for good at these mills joke. But as the seriousness: Why is not one bad woman throughout the game? If you do not call her Alberta who are with me through half the game, then. She is kind. I think. Maybe she really is evil, but it says nothing about the legend. And thankfully for that, I must point out, otherwise I had also killed her. And women should not kill. So it really answered the question. Funny how things twisting out, or what?</p>
<p>The funniest is really not all killing. I think the most fun in the game is the fact that the fight against things that are not real! It is just the snout witty! But so funny is it does not really. It is a sort of wonder at all the strange things to be found in the world. Take plankton whether that. They are small, tiny, but then eat hamburgers and other stuff and nonsense. It is because quite sad. But, as my mother always said, “one should not cry over milk played,” what now than it means.<br>
So: The question I would ask!<br>
How is it to not play the game?</p>
