            <p>Read the article! Nothing insanely new, the 3 new pics were cool, forgot to read the little notes in the black and white one though.</p>
<p>I bet the update will be magnificent even with bugs!</p>

<p>thanks for the link. The images are actually Concept artworks for Xen, rather than actually Source renditions. But they look awesome nonetheless!</p>

<p>If you can get on their website they had 3 options and google play was one of them.<br>
Be aware they are Asses and have really aggressive anti adblock script’s running so you will need to disable all scripts on their website or turn off adblock.</p>

<p>I don’t get why more people aren’t freaking about this in the forums. Even if it’s just interviews and a few new screenshots or whatever, without a release date or anything like that, it’s already quite a lot.</p>
<p>Maybe it’ll get more traction around here once the November issue is officially announced at the PC Gamer site.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I posted this info (crediting you of course) over in the steam forums, minimal response.<br>
A magazine article is not what we want nor what we are waiting for, hint it’s 3 letters and starts with X and ends with N.<br>
I live in a small town and there is no place to buy a single copy plus I am not going to subscribe just for this issue.<br>
Hopefully someone will scan the Black Mesa and related Half-Life articles and dropbox a pdf. nudge nudge wink wink</p>

            <p>I don’t get why more people aren’t freaking about this in the forums. Even if it’s just interviews and a few new screenshots or whatever, without a release date or anything like that, it’s already quite a lot.</p>
<p>Maybe it’ll get more traction around here once the November issue is officially announced at the PC Gamer site.</p>

<p>Hopefully this is a very good sign about the state of the game’s progress! It would certainly lead to unprecedented internet rage if the Xen release had to be delayed again, so the fact that this is coming out suggests they’re very confident they will meet their winter deadline. (I am assuming this feature includes new information, interviews, etc. provided by CC in part to promote the upcoming release)</p>

<p>The devs missed one deadline is hardly earth shattering in the game development world.<br>
Besides, the internet experiences unprecedented rage over a different thing every hour.<br>
This is not Black Mesa’s first appearance in PC Gamer, but considering the fury that was created when Marc Laidlaw released a “genderswapped snapshot of a dream I had many years ago.”, i am sure it will help sell many copies of the magazine.</p>

            <p>Apparently PC GAMER Magazine is doing a feature about Black Mesa, with “exclusive access”?</p>

<p>I wonder if they’ll show more of Xen!</p>
