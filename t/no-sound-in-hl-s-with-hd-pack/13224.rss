    <title>No sound in HL:S with HD pack</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-sound-in-hl-s-with-hd-pack/13224</link>
    <description>I know that talking about HL: Source on a BM forum is a blasphemy, but I want to play through it just to see the slightly different experience.
The problem is, when I use the HD pack, reload sound for pistol and SMG (in this case M4) is not played, but it works fine with no HD. Verifying game cache didn&#39;t help. Any ideas?</description>

            <p>I’ve actually been wondering about this myself, is there really no way to manually fix this?</p>

<p>Well, it is available in options, and without it viewmodels and enemies look the same as HL ones.</p>

            <p>There are no HD sounds, it uses the default ones, so they are not blank, and they play normally without HD pack. The HD pack was already available in options when I downloaded all HL1 games from Steam.</p>

            <p>I can’t recall - is the HD pack native to HLS, or did you install a port from goldsource? If it was ported, it may be that the sound ques in the model were lost in the decompilation process or use an older channel format.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the HD sounds might just be blank. Do they play in a media player or editing suite?</p>
