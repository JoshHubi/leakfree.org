    <description>This thread is all about the things from history, that get you mad/angry/ticked/miffed/pissed/etc - from history. Things that have happened in the name of politics, religious twisting, &quot;evil&quot; (If I am allowed the term) men and women, natural events and so forth... What makes your blood boil because of the people who have blemished our history with this or that transgression? 

What choices have the morons in power, the demented working their will in the shadows, or otherwise, things in general, have transpired that cause you to short circuit?

Let&#39;s hear/see what makes you rage -</description>

<p>r, all that trouble to form Yugoslavia only to cause even more death to split the damned thing up less than 75 years later. &gt;_&gt;</p>

<p>Yeah… after Tito died things went down hill and the shit hit the fans ten years later. Only if the Serbs wouldn’t have been assholes  there would been no war.<br>
I’m pretty saddened that it doesn’t exist anymore. Now I don’t even know what I am anymore… Bosniak, Yugoslav or Montenegrin…</p>

<p>Not really, because the thing that they did to make you mad already happened and there’s nothing you can do about it. “It’s better to deal with the present and learn from the past than to get mad.”</p>
<p>It’s EASIER to not be mad about events in the distant past, because there’s nobody to be mad at, but equally nonproductive.</p>

<p>Claiming Mengele contributed to scientific progress means your opinions of historical figures are nonsense. Thank you come again.</p>
<p>Also no, the Dalai Lama didn’t say that unless there’s some sort of reliable source for it. Not that A) I’d think less of him or B  ) that necessarily means he’s “mad at” Hitler.</p>

<p>It’s also the same reason I don’t pay undeserved respect to people who are sons/daughters of a person who fought in  a war.</p>
<p>If you didn’t go through shit in history, then you don’t deserve to be compensated.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t agree with either of these because the actions of the past DO affect the present.  If you go out and spend all your child’s college fund on beer and prostitutes while your child is an infant, it does affect your child later in life.</p>
<p>Since it affects the present, I do get mad at it.  I guess, in a way, I can get mad at things that happened in the past.</p>

            <p>Maybe not so much history, but I hate anyone who’s picking sides of “who’s fault it was that the cold war happen’d” or some crap like that. Seriously, both sides where stupid for not just trusting eachother that no one was planning on launching those nukes first. Mistrust is one of the main reasons of war these days.</p>

<p>See, I’m one of those weird guys that doesn’t really get mad at what happened in history.  What I do get mad about is if we don’t learn from our mistakes in the past and continue doing things that were wrong then and are wrong today.  I see it far too often, a supposedly “moral” people doing immoral things for whatever reason (politics, religion, just plain insanity) and using the same old rhetoric from yesteryear.</p>
<p>But, then again, perhaps that’s off-topic but I don’t get mad at what happened in history.  To use a business phrase: It is what it is.  It shouldn’t have been that, but it was.  So, let’s learn from our mistakes.</p>

<p>I sort of agree, getting mad from stuff from history is exactly like those feminists who are mad since men from a while ago (not us) used to be douchebags to women (but not them). Or a Jewish person getting mad at a German person even though both of them didn’t go through any of the shit and the German guy’s political opinions is not anything like Hitler’s.</p>
<p>It’s also the same reason I don’t pay undeserved respect to people who are sons/daughters of a person who fought in  a war.</p>
<p>If you didn’t go through shit in history, then you don’t deserve to be compensated.</p>
