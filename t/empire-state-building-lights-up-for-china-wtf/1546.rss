            <p>Actually I think by now it’s pretty clear Bush WAS a dumbass who never knew what to say unless he managed to remember the scripts prepared for him (which was very hit and miss).</p>

<p>Yes there is a reason to panic for someone like this guy. He probably didn’t know what to say and he didn’t want to be shown as a dumbass in front of the planet(he wasn’t a dumbass for not knowing what to say,but at that kind of moments you feel like a dumbass).</p>

<p>Shock as in “holy shit my country’s being attacked! WhadoIdo? WhadoIdo?” or shock as in “My gawd they really are gonna pull this off - I just hope everything goes as planned and nobody fucks up, otherwise we’ll gonna be in serious trouble!” ?<br>
Can you tell the difference? You should take a look at his face when he was asked by a reporter about whether or not he had had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSwtR8b4WCE" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">prior knowledge about the attack</a>. I think, if this assumption was so ridiculous, he would have reacted a little different. But that’s just me. He looks more than guilty to me at this point. Panicking. And there would be no reason to panic if the assumption the journalist relayed to him was not at all true.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes there would. An untrue rumour can be just as damaging as a dangerous truth. Don’t you think you’d be a little concerned if someone basically accused you of complicity with a terrorist attack? You don’t think that would throw you for six a little?</p>
<p>As for the rest, Occam’s razor is my guide.</p>

<p>After all these years of unsuccessful terrorism, why have terrorist organizations still not figured out that if they threaten a state government, they will get exactly the opposite reaction of what they demand them to do?</p>
