    <title>Massive FPS drops on certain savegames</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/massive-fps-drops-on-certain-savegames/10289</link>
    <description>I ran into this issue a couple of times throughout the game but I didn&#39;t really reproduce it until the very end (because I could progress anyway).

Basically, at the very end, in the teleporter room, my FPS is fine, but if I save the game when the aliens are about to start spawning and then reload that save then my framerate is f***ed. It got to be quite annoying because when I died I had to revert back to the autosave and watch the whole teleporter start-up sequence again. I tried saving both from the menu and with a quicksave but it didn&#39;t have any effect.</description>

            <p>Hi,<br>
Same problems of “late precache”, game run smoothly on my i7 2600k / 6Gb of RAM / HD5850, but sometimes i’ve some freezes due to these, it makes me crazy :’(<br>
No tried Episode 1 or 2, or even HL2 main campaign (i’ve just reinstalled it for BMS <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ). Mod bugs of Source problems?</p>

            <p>I have this “late precache” problem too. The game hangs for a second at the moment a creature dies. It happens only once with each new enemy on every new level.<br>
btw HL2, EP1/2 run smoothly.</p>
