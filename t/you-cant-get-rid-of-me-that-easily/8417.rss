[quote=&quot;Comrade Tiki&quot;]
Started driving &#39;er in January, but I think she&#39;s still pimp-worthy.

She... is no more.

Someone going 65 (in a 35 mph zone) decided to go off the road into my apartment complex&#39;s parking area, at 03:45 in the morning last night.

He swiped one car&#39;s tail light,
totaled my trunk (rotating my car 80 degrees from how it was parked),
brought my car into the rear of a Mazda 6 (crushing that irreparably, too),
and continued into a fourth car, a full-size Buick.

That Buick was pressed into the minivan beyond it.


It gets better.

These cars were parked alongside the building. By hitting my beautiful car so ferociously, he sent my vehicle&#39;s front through a one-foot thick brick-&amp;-cinder-block wall next to my window. (I like to park where I can see my car from bed, you see.)

The bed was just inside that window, head to the glass. There is a very real possibility that I would have been killed if I had been in bed sleeping then instead of living a nocturnal lifestyle.

I might post some video to YouTube later.</description>

            <p>It sat comfortably on top of a warm computer overnight.</p>
<p>The warming sun of the new day drove the night’s bitter coolth away. The day’s miraculous heat allowed me to discard of the lizard without any guilt, at the wood and brush on the opposite end of the building.</p>

            <p>I caught an anole tonight. I think it came inside from the side of the building in order to escape the cold.</p>
<p>I was about to release it, but I made the mistake of rinsing my hands before doing so. The cold felt biting, and I didn’t have the heart to leave it helpless out there-- it was smart enough to come inside, so it doesn’t deserve to die of exposure tonight.</p>

            <p>Here’s a post for the curious. Photos from when I went to gather belongings from my car.</p>
<p>This looks familiar!! It’s pretty messy (but overall intact). Note the Tiki air-freshener hanging from the mirror.

<p>Uh, what’s wrong with the back-seat:[indent]<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span>[/indent]</p>

            <p>You were lucky Tiki. Stupid people doing stupid shit while made stupider by the influence of alcohol is one of the main causes of mortality around the world.</p>
<p>Stay safe bro and try to avoid getting in the way of stupid people.</p>

            <p>Jesus Christ, Tiki. I’m glad you’re still amongst the living. Is the whole car totaled or just the trunk? I hope your insurance is good to cover some of this, since the driver didn’t have any…</p>

<p>wow. If this guy wasn’t in the gutter to begin with, he’s certainly gonna be it now ._.</p>

<p>He’s just two years older than me, I realize your concern-- but he listed his “Religious Views” on Facebook as “Arizona Diamondbacks” so I have a feeling he wasn’t the next Socrates.</p>

<p>What’s gonna happen if that man is unable to provide you with the funds for a wall repair?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Fortunately that wall is important to the building, and condominium association, as a whole-- which is well insured.</p>
<p>Damages inside might not be given as much attention (I’m hoping the damage to the doorframe is covered)… but the exterior wall and window are accounted for.</p>

<p>I bet the driver just stepped out of his truck hammered and got the fuck outta there quick. He knew he was in deep shit and prolly fled the scene. and by fleeing the scene, I mean limping away from all the cars he totalled.</p>
<p>Did the driver stay at the crash or was he gone before everyone came to investigate?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He walked toward where he had crossed offroad in order to enter the parking lot, which brought him out of view of the cameras which recorded the accident,<br>
but he was was recorded walking back toward the complex (in a big curve) where a resident (on his way out to view the crash) spotted him.</p>
<p>After he passed this resident, he made a weird gesture… looking down toward his forearm and holding his fist in front of him (palm upwards)…<br>
which I loosely believe represents the realization of “fuck, I’m not getting out of this”.</p>
<p>He walked past the mailboxes and made a big circle back toward the truck (whose engine was somehow still idling). He stood to the side and explained that he was just a passenger, and tried suggesting that the real driver ran off after the crash.</p>
<p>Obviously not a very good alibi. A neighbor immediately noticed that the armrest between the passenger- and driver-seat was still down (which should have been lifted if a passenger were to have crossed over and gotten out of the vehicle on the driver’s side, which he’d’ve had to-- considering what remained of my car was on his passenger-side).</p>
