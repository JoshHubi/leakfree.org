    <title>Compatibility Question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/compatibility-question/2662</link>
    <description>On the home page there is a question that reads, &quot;What will I need in order to play?&quot; Followed by the explanation that one must have a game featuring the source engine. I recently bought Half-Life: Source, and I was wondering if that would apply as one of those games, even though the &quot;detailed list&quot; did not list it?</description>
