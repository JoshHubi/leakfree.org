    <title>When will Black Mesa come out?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/when-will-black-mesa-come-out/2505</link>
    <description>Now, now before you all go ape shit and start screaming &quot;When It&#39;s done!&quot;, this is a legitimate question, the FAQ says something like early 2010 or first quarter of 2010, I havn&#39;t played the first half life yet and I would like to play it now, however if black mesa will actually come out within the next 6 months or so I can wait and just play black mesa instead. Now if the developers actually think that they will be done by about summer this year, I&#39;ll wait, but is it just another random date, because if so I might as well just play it now.</description>

            <p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Not another one of these threads. There is no accurate prediction of when it will come out. My best guess is first quarter this year.  And asking random strangers online if you should play the original game or wait indefinitely for the game to come out is a little bit silly. Take some initiative and decide for yourself. I’d say just play it now instead of waiting though, you’ll enjoy it more when BM finally does come out.</p>

<p>If I were you I’d play the original first; it’s still a great game and you’ll be able to appreciate the re-imagining of the locations and all the hard work the team put in. I went through Half Life again recently, and am really looking forward to the remake.</p>

<p>Awesome first post, as opposed to the OP.</p>

            <p>Yes, it’s a random date. No, they won’t tell you when it will be released. We just assume it’s gonna be soon, because they were pretty certain that they can finish the mod before the end of 2009.</p>
