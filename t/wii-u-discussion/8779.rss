    <title>Wii U Discussion</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wii-u-discussion/8779</link>
    <description>Although I&#39;m sure most of the members of this forum are mainly PC gaming oriented which I am as well, but I enjoy a little sit down in front of the TV with controller in hand every now and again.

I figure the Wii U is Nintendo&#39;s venture back into hardcore territory, and I&#39;ll gladly welcome it. 

This threads primary purpose is for:

• General discussion regarding the console and it&#39;s games
• Release speculation for both the games and console itself
• Technical shit
• Whether you&#39;re interested in purchase or not
• News Articles regarding the console
• Etc.

I&#39;ll start with some interesting news. At last years E3, the controller was showed off and I thought it was generally great, but could be better. One of my worries has been fixed, they&#39;ve transitioned back to extended analogue sticks instead of the awkward circle pads showed at the show floor in June last year.

Also there&#39;s rumors of a Star Fox/Metroid crossover game in development by Retro Studios (Donkey Kong Country Returns/Metroid Prime Series). I&#39;m interested in that as well.


TL;DR: This thread is about Wii U[/SIZE]</description>

<p>Uh, no. The WiiU uses a GPU 2 generations or so ahead of the PS3’s.</p>

            <p>WiiU is going to encounter a lot of problems once next gen starts. The WiiU runs on pretty much the same graphics as the ps3. Once the next gen consoles get under way WiiU will be left in the dust because developers will be working on higher end products and I cant imagine that they will want to program the game to lower standards for the WiiU.</p>
<p>So just like the last Wii the only games that will be made are ones that really just focus on nintendo products.</p>

            <p>NintendoLand sounded like a hardware bundled showcase game in the vein of WiiSports to me.  I can’t really see a lot of deep content coming out of just twelve worlds made up of minigames. It wouldn’t be anything I’d buy into anyways. Odd way to close out a show to be sure.</p>
<p>Edit: Pikmin 3 is not going to feature online multiplayer co-op. Something to do with too many Pikmin onscreen at once.</p>

<p>But it may just be the case that an F-Zero, StarFox, or Metroid may not currently in the works, or that there is simply not enough content to show. Or perhaps Nintendo is focused on developing a quality product, that much like the BMS team, prefer to keep things underwraps until the game is basically finished. Why spend time on creating a demo build when you could be focusing on making the best quality product you can.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is pretty much how I feel about the conference as well. I gather from interviews that Retro themselves specifically told Nintendo that they weren’t to reveal anything about the game they were working on, and I would assume most of the core franchise games are either too early in development to share or not yet in development.</p>
<p>Not only that, but I get the impression they wanted to focus on what the Wii U tablet could do, and without a core franchise game being more or less complete at this stage (which is unlikely so far from console release) they couldn’t have given us anything more than “Hey, we’re making another one.”. Hype inducing, but not terribly productive. Announce whatever Retro is making between now and launch and the fans will hype it plenty with or without E3.</p>
<p>Personally, I see Pikmin 3 as a core franchise and, maybe I’m alone here, but I’m extremely excited for that one. Ok, so it isn’t the next Metroid game, but it’s been 8 years since the last one and people have been waiting for Nintendo to revive this franchise ever since.</p>
<p>They spent too much time on Nintendoland, and the 3DS lineup, while looking decent, wasn’t terribly well presented. The 1 hour showcase was really everything they told us during the 10 minute conference segment stretched out way too long. (Yay Luigi’s Mansion though).</p>
<p>Overall, an adequate, but not great conference. It accomplished what it needed to, demonstrating the Wii U potential, while hitting all the bases. Pikmin 3 for the core franchises, Arkham City for 3rd party support, and Wii Fit U for the casual market.</p>
<p>Announce anything hype inducing (Retro Studios) between now and launch, and I think they’ll do just fine.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was slightly disappointed with their press conference, and subsequently the 3DS Demonstration, as they could have pushed more core titles out for WiiU. Not necessarily all first party either. Nintendo’s conferences have a tendancy to leave one yearning for more because the potential is there. In fact, I think Ubisoft had a better WiiU showcase than Nintendo did.</p>
<p>But it may just be the case that an F-Zero, StarFox, or Metroid may not currently in the works, or that there is simply not enough content to show. Or perhaps Nintendo is focused on developing a quality product, that much like the BMS team, prefer to keep things underwraps until the game is basically finished. Why spend time on creating a demo build when you could be focusing on making the best quality product you can.</p>
<p>I trust Nintendo’s judgement, and I look forward to what they will present in the future.</p>

<p>Those are all excellent concepts, whether you’re joking or not. Though what I don’t get is why kids keep crying for GTA style Mario. That’s just a ridiculous idea that Nintendo would never buy into.</p>

            <p>Severely dissapointed with Nintendo’s Conference. Was expecting a new Retro game, Starfox/F-Zero, and Monolithsoft’s new game. At least Retro’s project seemed like a given. The “launch window” games look good; but add up the facts that they confirmed the black WiiU is a tease; all the first party games at launch (as well as third party probably) will be 720p and Pikmin is the only confirmed 60fps game(<span class="bbcode-b">Nintendo, why U no take advantage of the fancy hardware?!</span>); and finally that Nintendo will be super-filtering all communication in the “MiiVerse” leading to delays up to <span class="bbcode-b">thirty minutes</span> between messages, and I can’t get excited by the console.</p>
<p>They <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> dropped the ball this E3, and I’ll probably just wait until they have a good selection of games, and a colored version. I’m bored of black and white electronics, I haven’t had a colored gaming device since the Gameboy SP because I got pretty much all Nintendo consoles at launch and the PS3 Slim shortly after it came out. (I also have a hand-me-down 360 that’s a replacement of a launch console.) I think I’ll be fine waiting this launch out until something really worthwhile surfaces. It just sucks with such a powerful console they didn’t go all out and show at least <span class="bbcode-i">something</span> that couldn’t work on the other ones (I believe the leaked specs, so it really pisses me off that Nintendo doesn’t give a shit about using it properly before the next consoles show up. I mean how could NSMBU, Pikmin or “NintendoLand” possibly stress the hardware enough to warrant 720p30fps!? Even on current gen ie. Xbox and PS3 hardware!)</p>

            <p>One thing I thought was pretty cool is that Gearbox is using the pad as a motion tracker for colonial marines, so you actually look down at the pad to see the MT and read whats around you.</p>
<p>I mean it wouldn’t make me buy it, but still, it’s a pretty cool idea.</p>

            <p>The WiiU comes with the touch screen GamePad, so it doesn’t become an optional peripheral, but instead an integral part of the WiiU experience. Plus, it doesn’t look bigger than a Nook tablet anyways. They just keep putting it in small hands, so it looks huge.</p>
<p>Nintendo likes doing things different, whether it’s ahold idea, or not. Usually, it doesn’t they don’t turn out half bad. If you don’t Wii remotes (which I don’t see how that could be a bad) the new Pro controller is an excellent alternative, if not an unoriginal one.</p>
<p>With that being said, Nintendo’s press conference was rather disappointing. I was hoping for more I didn’t already know about. NintendoLand was cool, in a mini-game collection kind of way, but they should have closed with something bigger and more exciting.</p>

<p>for those developers too lazy or uninovative  to make use of the main screen.</p>

</aside>
<p>Honestly, the controller with a screen is my biggest turn off from the WiiU.  That thing isn’t going to be cheap, so I’m glad Nintendo has a cheaper alternative.  Use the Pro controller that came with your WiiU, buy some gamepads for when friends come over.</p>
<p>I’m still not excited about potentially having to buy a bunch of Wiimotes to go with a WiiU.</p>
<p>I’m still waiting to make up my mind on getting a WiiU.  The plain gamepad makes me more likely to get one, but I need more information before deciding.</p>
<p>Edit: I didn’t watch Nintendo’s press conference, so accidentally swapped the names of the controllers.  Oh well.</p>

            <p>Found this saying the Wiiu pro controller will be rechargeable via a usb cable.<br>

<p>Which makes sense since we saw the Wiiu gamepad connected to a similar cable at the E3 conference.<br>

<p>I was looking forward to both specs/battery life for the tablet. Like Maxey said, hopefully more info comes Tuesday.</p>

<p>I would assume that the GamePad (as it’s now officially called) as well as the Pro controller will be rechargeable via the console, a la Dualshock 3. Personally, that made the DS3’s battery life irrelevant when all you had to do was plug it back into the console to keep using it.</p>

            <p>Now that’s the kind if functionality that gets me excited for the WiiU. Graphics are secondary. I’m really looking forward to see how Nintendo finally embraces the online market. The 3DS was a step in the right direction, however WiiU is taking leaps and bounds. Sure, they’re a little behind in that department, but now they know they want to sink their teeth into both HD and full online integration.</p>
