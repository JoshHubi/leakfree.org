    <title>TF2 and HL2 content</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tf2-and-hl2-content/223</link>
    <description>Hi

Sometimes when I&#39;m mapping for TF2, I need to use something from the HL2 content. This might be a sound or a texture or model that TF2 is missing that the map is needing. The question for this thread is:

Do I really need to pakrat the HL2 content into the bsp so that the users who only have purchased TF2 can see/hear the non-tf2 content that originated from the HL2 files?


*TF2 = Team Fortress 2
*HL2 = Half-Life 2</description>

            <p>In Hammer, any textures sounds and models that are available (ie: you can see them and select them) you can use.</p>
<p>If you’re mapping for TF2 you will have all the HL2 textures and sounds available aswell. It seems counter-intuitive because HL2 stuff wouldn’t “fit” in TF2, but the Source 2007 gcfs are included with and shared by all Orange Box engine games for modders/mappers to use freely (portal, ep2, tf2, dod :s ).</p>
<p>Don’t ask for evidence, try it yourself.</p>

            <p>Is there any evidence to support this? That’s pretty much all I care about. And thanks btw.</p>

            <p>You can use HL2 content in TF2 freely without any problems. If someone has TF2 installed, they will have all the Source 2007 .GCFs installed aswell. Same applies to DoD:S, CS:S, Portal etc… You don’t need to add anything to the .BSP</p>

<p>I thought that (say, if you own Counter-Stike: Source I think you also get Half-Life 2 content, say props etcetera) but I cannot say that with any real certainty as I own Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source.</p>

<p>Well after just checking you can indeed use HL2 content in TF2, or Hammer’s special and it doesn’t actually work ingame.</p>

            <p>Extract the necessary files using GCF Scape, located here:</p>
<p><a href="https://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=25" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=25</a></p>
<p>Then use Pakrat to embed the files into your compiled map BSP file:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.geocities.com/cofrdrbob/pakrat.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.geocities.com/cofrdrbob/pakrat.html</a></p>
<p>It’s all reasonably self-explanatory.  It’s quite easy to test if your stuff is working too, either move your Half-Life 2 gcf files to another location but do not re-download them, or have some kind friend (who you trust) who does not own Half-Life 2 to test your map.</p>
<p>There are other utilities that can do this, but Pakrat is the one I found easiest to use.  There is no other way.</p>
