    <title>Problem with resolution</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-with-resolution/13456</link>
    <description>Hello everyone  :slight_smile: 
If I write today, it&#39;s for a problem I met on Black Mesa, a problem very annoying. By the way, I can&#39;t put the mod in 1920x1080 resolution !
It&#39;s very strange, I can only put it on 1280x720 :| And I have a powerful PC :
Intel Core i7
AMD Radeon R9 270
16 GB RAM

And my screen is full HD...

I need help to resolve this thing  :frowning:  Can you help me ?
Thank you and I see you later  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>My guess is you’re trying to use a 16:10 aspect ratio correct? Switch it to 16:9 - then you can change it to the optimal resolution for your monitor. Also, 16:10 doesn’t increase quality, it just allows certain games to support ‘weird’ resolutions like ‘1366x768’.</p>
