            <p>Good call, Leijonasisu, but it’s not only HP’s bloatware that does this, my thinkpad has the same feature, built in to the synaptics driver.</p>
<p>Look under the mouse options in your Control Panel OP.</p>

            <p>Lemmie guess it’s an HP laptop. You might have bloatware called “Touchfreeze” running. This disables the trackpad click for 2 seconds after a key is pressed, to prevent accidental clicks while typing. Unfortunately, this disables mouse clicking too – not ideal for WASD shooters.</p>
<p>Before starting the game, look in the taskbar for an icon shaped like a trackpad. It should be called ‘touchfreeze’ if you click on it. Exit the program.</p>

            <p>Hmm…you said primary attack starts working when you map it to a keyboard key…must be your mouse? If left mouse works in other games, I dunno then :\</p>

            <p>Im unsure what your problem is did you try setting to defaults? does this happen in any other source game? Also if i may help you I think you would have received more help if you put this in the “Help” Category, this is not a bug but a problem on your end. This should be moved to Help maybe you could PM a moderator or if they see this thread they may move it anyways.</p>
