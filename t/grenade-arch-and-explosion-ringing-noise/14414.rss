    <title>Grenade Arch and explosion ringing noise</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/grenade-arch-and-explosion-ringing-noise/14414</link>
    <description>I believe something is wrong with the way grenades are thrown, it&#39;s very hard to aim them. I notice when you look straight up and throw it, it goes far behind you instead of straight up. I believe there is something wrong with the grenade arch trajectory and this proves it.

The explosion ringing noise is a huge problem, it absolutely hurts my ears and I do not enjoy it. People who suffer from tinnitus are going to be caused pain by that noise. I hope the noise is completely removed, not lessened. I really want to dev team to understand that ringing noises should not be in video games, it actually causes physical pain for a lot of people, myself included.</description>

            <p>The next update features a huge UI update with more options, etc. I’ll ask a programmer how easy it is to make the ringing a toggleable option; on by default.</p>
<p>I’ve never understood why our grenade arc is the way it is. I’ll ask about it.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure you can turn off the ringing in settings, if I’m not mistaken. I may be wrong tho, I haven’t played the steam release yet.</p>

<p>Only on the Houndeye’s sonic blast.</p>
<p>Only thing I can think of in the meantime for this would be a mod to replace the sound, probably with a silent audio file. Unsure that the devs would ever flat out remove it, so this would probably be your best option.</p>
