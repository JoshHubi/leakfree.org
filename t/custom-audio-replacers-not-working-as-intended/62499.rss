    <title>Custom audio replacers not working as intended</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/custom-audio-replacers-not-working-as-intended/62499</link>
    <description>So with the new Xen update, I wanted to try it out again, but in the process of TRYING to get my client set up, it looks like there&#39;s something borked with the VPK system and using custom audio mods.

Case and point: Failed to load sound &quot;)weapons\shotgun\double.wav&quot;, file probably missing from disk/repository

I KNOW I built a file (that specific one), put it into my custom VPK and the game loaded it (a majority of the other sound replacers I fished out of my other clients work as well). It just won&#39;t play certain sounds and its getting on my nerves because I cannot find the cause of the issue.

I&#39;ve rebuilt the cache, checked out the manifest, and even gone through some other options at my disposal before posting here. So what gives, how do I get this working properly?</description>
