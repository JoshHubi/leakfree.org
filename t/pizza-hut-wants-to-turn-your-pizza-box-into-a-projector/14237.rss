Whether or not Plano, Texas based Pizza Hut truly invented the stuffed crust pizza could be an item up for debate until the end of time. But records will show that Pizza Hut probably just created the first interactive pizza box.

In a marketing effort that has started overseas, Pizza Hut has turned its pizza boxes into multimedia projectors [url=&#39;https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/7/8743741/this-pizza-hut-box-turns-into-a-movie-projector&#39;]as first reported by The Verge.[/url]
Designed by the ad agency Ogilvy Hong Kong, the pizza boxes features a cutout circle and a provided spy-glass. When the spy-glass is inserted into the cutout, the box is suddenly a homemade projector for any smartphone, blowing up the picture on your screen and onto a nearby wall.

Snapping a picture of a specific QR code will play a Pizza Hut promotional video to match the different types of films on each box.
The boxes are designed with artistic elements on the main display where normally a giant Pizza Hut logo would be placed. They’re called Slice Night (for horror fans), Anchovy Armageddon (for science-fiction), Hot &amp; Ready (for romance), and Fully Loaded (for an action flick).
The photos and details on the project were posted to [url=&#39;https://reedcollins.prosite.com/83415/6540513/projects/pizza-hut&#39;]the personal website of Reed Collins, Chief Creative Officer of Ogilvy Hong Kong.[/url]
In the marketing photos, the box is referenced as the “Block Buster Box” with the catch line “Because pizza and movies were made for each other.”
The boxes are being used in Hong Kong and the video posted to Collins’ personal page shows customer reaction via social media. The reaction in the promotional video was overwhelmingly positive, though that’s to be expected.</description>
