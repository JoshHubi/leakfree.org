    <title>Crash going down ladder in blast pit</title>

    <description>Hi,

I was really getting into BMS this time around,  as the last time I tried it ran poorly and had loads of errors, but this time all was going well with a brand new install.

Until I hit the ladder, after bbqing the blast pit monster.   I tried googling first but could not come up with much, except a report on a bug tracker that listed this as &quot;trivial&quot; and asking for a crash dump,  and a similar forum post I think that mentioned the issue.   I tried with and without flashlight.   No difference

I would [b]love[/b] to provide a crash dump,  but the game doesn&#39;t create one that I can find.   I searched the whole  Steam folder and subfolders inside it and found no generated dump files.

On the forums the location listed is also erroneous,  as the source sdk 2007 folder has now been moved into the  common  folder with all other games for some reason.    I don&#39;t know if this is why it doesn&#39;t generate a dump but thought I would mention it..

This is all I can provide

            <p>Hmmm alright, so it appears it was a setting in RadeonPro that was doing it.</p>
