    <title>shiny/white spots on characters skin</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shiny-white-spots-on-characters-skin/11309</link>
    <description>Hello. I know this is probably an old rendering error due to some messed up cvar and not really related to black mesa. Still, you guys seem to know a thing and two about the engine and cvars. So can you please have a look and tell me what i need to change in my autoexec to make the characters nice again please?

Here&#39;s how it looks like:

And here&#39;s the settings, sorry for swedish lang

And here is my specs:
Intel P4 2.66 @ 2.9ghz
Geforce 6800GE (asus v9999), unlocked pipes/vertex @ 430/1170
1GB of RAM, pc2700
XP 32bit.

I know it&#39;s old hardware, but I was so eager to play BMS so i had to throw this old chunks of hardware together and fire it up  :stuck_out_tongue:  Major stuttering on the Pentium 4, but after some tweaking it runs better.


Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>Ok so it’s no caused by the config. I removed the config and it’s still there. I also tried to reinstall the game but with no luck. I tried different texture and model graphics settings, medium etc… doesn’t help. Shaders on low didn’t help either. It’s strange, because when i first installed BMS and had no custom cfg file then i didn’t have this rendering error. Can something help me please?</p>
<p>Edit: It’s not caused by the graphics card being overclocked, I reset stock clocks and it’s still there.</p>
<p>Am using the 285.58 forceware drivers. Perhaps they are causing this. But if i recall correctly the white spots where there even on the latest drivers, I downgraded drivers because of square shadows issue.</p>
<p>I have really tried about everything. Something is holding the cvars/settings even after uninstalling/reinstalling BMS, am trying to figure out a way to really remove the game and the settings too. Cuz I didn’t have these rendering errors in the first place.</p>
