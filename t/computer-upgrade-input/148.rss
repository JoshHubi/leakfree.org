    <title>Computer Upgrade Input</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-upgrade-input/148</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m hitting that 3 year life cycle for my computer and am looking to upgrade some of my parts. Here&#39;s a note of what I plan on replacing:

ASUS M2N-SLI Deluxe AM2
AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ Windsor 2.2GHz
CORSAIR XMS2 2GB (2 x 1GB) 240-Pin DDR2

And this is what I&#39;m looking to upgrade to:

[url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131386&#39;]ASUS P6T SE LGA 1366 Intel X58[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115202&#39;]Intel Core i7 920 Nehalem 2.66GHz[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227424&#39;]OCZ Gold 6GB (3 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR3[/url]

Those 3 = $630

My question is, would I be better off going with the new i7 or sticking with something like this:
[url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115130&amp;Tpk=Q9650&#39;]Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650 3.0GHz[/url]
+ Whatever 775 mobo
+ Keep my current memory (add another 2 sticks)

Those 3 = $490

Future proofing isn&#39;t a huge deal to me, because usually a new architecture comes out by the time I upgrade my computer again. My budget is anything up to $650. I usually would be able to handle this on my own, but I made myself stay out of looking at hardware for the last 3 years after being short on cash.

I know that really no games take advantage of 4 cores entirely, so that makes me wonder if I can get away with getting the LGA 775 socket without having to worry about a performance impact and save a good $150 (but lose 2gb of RAM). 

Does anybody have some good info on this Q9650 vs the 920 i7 issue? I did a bit of googling and found that people say there is virtually no difference in gaming between the two in certain situations. I do use other productivity apps in my spare time, but honestly, either CPU will feel a hell of a lot snappier than my current X2 4200+. More than likely I&#39;ll be running a single GPU setup, and from what I understand that the Q9650 would be close to the 920 in that regard.</description>

            <p>The one problem I have with ATI cards is that I’ve never followed their counting system, and I don’t know how their cards stack up compared to their own or any nvidia cards. I know their 4850 is the top of the line, but no idea where it goes from there.</p>

            <p>Cool! Great Choice! Sweet motherboard too, you can upgrade the bios without even having to access windows, you can access the internet in the Bios with a browser called “Express gate”.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Final List<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103649" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">AMD Phenom II X3 720 - $139.00</a><br>

<p>Total cost = ~$479</p>
<p>Not too shabby considering a similar parts replacement build for the i7 would have costed me upwards of $900. And that’s without a new video card.</p>

            <p>AMD isn’t a bad option at all, but be aware that the chips aren’t necessarily equal just because they’re clocked at the same speed (even ignoring cache size). With Intel you generally get more performance at the same clocks, but with AMD you generally get higher clocks for less, so it’s kind of a toss-up. Barring costs I would go with an intel over  an AMD, but you should look at some specs and tests first.

            <p>Yup, no problem, glad to help. Here in Canada it’s even more of a difference, (over here the <a href="https://wintroniccomputers.com/wintronics/viewProduct.jspa?product=bf73088c1dba0193011f2ded949f0297" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Phenom II 940 is 260$</a> and for the <a href="https://wintroniccomputers.com/wintronics/viewProduct.jspa?product=bf73088c1c3abb1d011c7674705f001d" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Q9650 it’s 450$</a>)</p>
<p>If you’re planning to upgrade the video card later on, you could go with the M4A78 pro and wait till the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814103069" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">4850</a> or <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102801" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">4870</a> lowers in price even more (you can still use your card on that motherboard).</p>

            <p>Very interesting input there Joe… Definitely something I can consider and well within my price range. It’ll keep me from spending my saved tuition money for college, so that’s a plus… lol</p>
<p>To be honest… I don’t indulge in many video games. I’m confined to World of Warcraft (go ahead, throw your stones  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) And source engine games. Once and awhile I’ll go and pick up Crysis or some game based on the UT3 engine (which my current computer doesn’t have much problems with). Other than that, I browse the interwebs, run photoshop, dreamweaver, etc. while I’m designing/coding stuff. So the AMD solution sounds great to me. The extra RAM and more CPU power will really aide my multitasking, and perhaps leave me enough buying room for another LCD screen  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I would stick with AMD for the Price.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103471" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">AMD Phenom II 940 3.0Ghz</a> Think about it, 190$ versus 330$ same size and speed, better price. The only difference is the size of the Cache which frankly I wouldn’t pay 140$ more just to say I have 4 more megabytes.</p>
<p>You said you would be only using one video card, so one of these would probably be best:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131362" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Asus M4A78 Pro (For Hybrid Crossfire)</a> 100$</p>

<p>and for RAM</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227334" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OCZ 4gb combo (800mhz DDR2)</a> 46$ x2 = 92$ for <span class="bbcode-b">8GB ram</span></p>
<p>total: 382$ for ATI and Nvidia Setup, can’t beat that price for a 3Ghz Quad core setup</p>

            <p>So I’m hitting that 3 year life cycle for my computer and am looking to upgrade some of my parts. Here’s a note of what I plan on replacing:</p>
<p>ASUS M2N-SLI Deluxe AM2<br>
AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ Windsor 2.2GHz<br>
CORSAIR XMS2 2GB (2 x 1GB) 240-Pin DDR2</p>
<p>And this is what I’m looking to upgrade to:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131386" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ASUS P6T SE LGA 1366 Intel X58</a><br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115202" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Intel Core i7 920 Nehalem 2.66GHz</a><br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227424" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OCZ Gold 6GB (3 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR3</a></p>
<p>Those 3 = $630</p>
<p>My question is, would I be better off going with the new i7 or sticking with something like this:<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115130&amp;Tpk=Q9650" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650 3.0GHz</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Whatever 775 mobo</li>
<li>Keep my current memory (add another 2 sticks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those 3 = $490</p>
<p>Future proofing isn’t a huge deal to me, because usually a new architecture comes out by the time I upgrade my computer again. My budget is anything up to $650. I usually would be able to handle this on my own, but I made myself stay out of looking at hardware for the last 3 years after being short on cash.</p>
<p>I know that really no games take advantage of 4 cores entirely, so that makes me wonder if I can get away with getting the LGA 775 socket without having to worry about a performance impact and save a good $150 (but lose 2gb of RAM).</p>
<p>Does anybody have some good info on this Q9650 vs the 920 i7 issue? I did a bit of googling and found that people say there is virtually no difference in gaming between the two in certain situations. I do use other productivity apps in my spare time, but honestly, either CPU will feel a hell of a lot snappier than my current X2 4200+. More than likely I’ll be running a single GPU setup, and from what I understand that the Q9650 would be close to the 920 in that regard.</p>
