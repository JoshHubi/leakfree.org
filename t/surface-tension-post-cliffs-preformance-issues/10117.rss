    <description>The majority of the game for me has been pretty smooth sailing other than the odd crash, which makes this problem so much worse for me. Basically, any time I attempt to fight the soldiers and the tank here:

EDIT: Less dust in frame here-

[img]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1639&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1347763537[/img]

My framerate gets cut in half no matter my visual settings. At maxed out, I get around 8-12fps down from 30, and in the above picture, it drops to 12-24 from 60+fps with everything on low. I think the Abrams tank is the primary culprit, as well as the dust clouds generated when rounds impact. 

Of course, it&#39;s not just the framerate- those assholes have me dead to rights the second I can get in range to attack. This map was excruciating to play through in the original Half-Life and I can see you&#39;ve faithfully reproduced this level to be equally frustrating to play through. There&#39;s virtually no cover from any point, and the addition of hgrunts dropping explosive barrels in the canal zone makes it all the more impossible to survive on Hard difficulty. I&#39;ve died here about 20 times already, it&#39;s just ridiculous!

Although admittedly I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. The feel of this game, from the art direction to the level design, is just spot-on for Half Life. It&#39;s like playing it again for the first time. But yeah, so the fps here drops a ton because of the tank here.

</aside>
<p>What’s your definition of “maxed graphics”? Could you please specify the exact settings used (most importantly: AA level and the method used to set is - either by in-game menus and/or through nVIDIA CP; filtering used - was it default trilinear as set by the engine or something more fancy like AF 16x and so on)? Screenshot of the in-game advanced graphical settings dialog would suffices coupled with the detailed info on any setting you set/changed in GPU drivers control panel.</p>

</aside>
<p>RAM - OK. CPU - should be sufficient but isn’t really good TBH.<br>
GPU - that’s you problem most probably. It’s a pretty old chip and - what is worse - it is a mobile version of it. Fillrate won’t be enough to handle a lot of pixel-shader based effects or a lot of alpha-blended surfaces on the screen.</p>
<p>Examples of the things that GPU won’t be able to handle are the smoke clouds seen on the screenshot you posted. Lower output resolution, set shaders and shadows quality to “Low” - it could mitigate the problem a bit.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, yeah, that’s definitely weird. Make a habbit to go into console and turn on budget panel (sv_cheats 1; +showbudget) as soon as you hit an FPS drop,  posting screenshots with it is the easiest way to give devteam some hints about what had gone wrong. And, as a matter of curiosity, do you have vsync turned off? With the GPU like yours there’s no way to get acceptable FPS having vsync turned on.</p>

</aside>
<p>I hope you’ve got a savegame near the place where you experience this perfdrop? If so, then - to be on a safe side - save your current game and then open up in-game console and execute:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">disconnect
sv_cheats 1
+showbudget
budget_panel_height 900</code></pre>
<p>Now you should have a neat panel with a lot of stats displayed at the left part of the game screen. Load up a savegame and immediately open up in-game console, execute:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">notarget
god
ai_disable</code></pre>
<p>Then close the console and navigate to a place where you experience FPS drop. Take a screenshot and post it here. If longest bar showed among the graphs is next to “Dynamioc_Light_Rendering” - try executing the following commands at console and check if FPS goes to a normal levels:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">r_dynamic 0
r_dynamiclighting 0</code></pre>
<p>If among the graps longest bars are next to Static_Prop_Rendering and Other_Model_Rendering and also if there’s a bar of a noticeable length next to CViewRender::Render, try executing the following at the console and check your FPS level:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">r_WaterDrawReflection 0</code></pre>
<p>Next, if the longest bar is against Swap_Buffers try executing:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mat_viewportscale 0.25</code></pre>
<p>Now you should have game producing 4x smaller picture in size locate at the top left corner of the Window. Had it made the FPS level go noticeably up? If so - you’re experiencing insufficient fillrate problems (i.e. your GPU is unable to process the pixels at the high enough speed and thus you get low FPS)  - turn off AA (if any), use lower level of AF or even turn it off completely and fallback to the trilinear filtering. You should also consider lowering the resolution you run the game at and think about changing your GPU to something more powerfull.</p>
<p>If the longest bar you have is next to “Unaccounted” - check if fps_max cvar value isn’t set too low (chances are slim as you’d be getting low FPS everywhere in the game if have this one set too low) and then make sure you have no demanding tasks running at background (like disk defragmentors, web browser with a lot of Flash-based ads, youtube videos, e.t.c.).</p>
<p>Lastly, try executing the following at the console:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mat_stub 1</code></pre>
<p>You should get no game render output (i.e. black game screen except for menus) but what it important here is the FPS level you’d got in this mode. It should be really high (at 100+ range, possibly capped by fps_max). If not - you’re CPU bound and not GPU bound here, most probably due to some veird physics-related bug in BMS you had happen to hit.</p>
<p>Do undo all the changes you’ve done execute the following in the console:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mat_stub 0
mat_viewportscale 1
r_dynamic 1
r_dynamiclighting 1
r_WaterDrawReflection 1
notarget
god
ai_disable</code></pre>
<p>Please, report your findings to this thread so devs could track and fix this problem in future updates. Thanks.</p>
<p>P.S. And could you please also specify the hardware you use to play the game. Software configuration also would be useful to know, i.e. windows version and architecture (32bit or 64bit), drivers version and so on.</p>

            <p>The majority of the game for me has been pretty smooth sailing other than the odd crash, which makes this problem so much worse for me. Basically, any time I attempt to fight the soldiers and the tank here:</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>EDIT: Less dust in frame here-</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>My framerate gets cut in half no matter my visual settings. At maxed out, I get around 8-12fps down from 30, and in the above picture, it drops to 12-24 from 60+fps with everything on low. I think the Abrams tank is the primary culprit, as well as the dust clouds generated when rounds impact.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not just the framerate- those assholes have me dead to rights the second I can get in range to attack. This map was excruciating to play through in the original Half-Life and I can see you’ve faithfully reproduced this level to be equally frustrating to play through. There’s virtually no cover from any point, and the addition of hgrunts dropping explosive barrels in the canal zone makes it all the more impossible to survive on Hard difficulty. I’ve died here about 20 times already, it’s just ridiculous!</p>
<p>Although admittedly I wouldn’t have it any other way. The feel of this game, from the art direction to the level design, is just spot-on for Half Life. It’s like playing it again for the first time. But yeah, so the fps here drops a ton because of the tank here.<br>
