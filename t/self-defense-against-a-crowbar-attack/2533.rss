            <p>That is a very rigid crowbar defense, and I wouldn’t use that at all. Trying to stop the momentum of a crowbar strike is foolish.</p>
<p>I would avoid strikes until he had a really good follow through that I could find an opening to smother his striking arm against his body, and then strike him to the face with as many punches as it took to get him down.</p>
