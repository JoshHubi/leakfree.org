    <title>Anomalous Materials Elevator - Load skipping</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anomalous-materials-elevator-load-skipping/9575</link>
    <description>Hi,

the first time I played, I went out of the elevator that leads down to the test chamber a bit early. I landed safely, the elevator came to a halt, but the door did not open. I wasn&#39;t able to advance at that point. It looks like you can prevent the loading screen from triggering this way.
It&#39;s not a big issue, but I had to redo that &quot;getting the HEV suit&quot; part.

EDIT: Seems as if this has already been mentioned [url=https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=490738&amp;postcount=2]here[/url].

Apart from that and a few minor issues, this mod is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. I love the immersive athmosphere and subtle changes. The sound is good, the music is fantastic. The eastereggs are hilarious. The gameplay is pretty smooth and direct. Words can not describe what great job has been done. I am truly impressed.

Greetings,
Seth</description>
