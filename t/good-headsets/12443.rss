    <title>Good Headsets?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/good-headsets/12443</link>
    <description>Hi there,

Simple question. Does anyone know of good headset that has decently good mic sound quality? 
I&#39;m looking into doing some game commentary and &quot;Lets Play&quot;-ing, so it&#39;d need to be decently good at the least.

I&#39;ve googled things, but I&#39;m not very good at these kinds of things so I&#39;m not entirely sure what&#39;s good, or bad, or overrated, etc. 
My ideal price range is $80-110 dollars just to narrow it down (though if its like 120-130 thats fine too).

Thanks for any help/advice  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>Thanks for your ‘concern’, I’ll take what you’ve said into consideration, especially the part about getting good headphones, since I have noticed in my attempt at research that gaming headsets in general have much lower overall than dedicated only-headphones.</p>
<p>But yeah, I wouldn’t be upset or anything. Like I said, I talk during my games anyway, I just figured it’d be fun to record it and put it up,it’s not for fame or money. I work part time and go to uni, so I have arguably more important things to worry about than getting youtube famous.</p>

            <p>I don’t recommend a condenser mic unless you know what you’re doing and will be recording in a nice quiet space. Get a nice dynamic mic like a Beta 58 and a desk stand.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I recommended a condenser mic, any condenser mic is better than a headset mic.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what I use: <a href="https://www.apogeedigital.com/products/one-mac.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.apogeedigital.com/products/one-mac.php</a>, it’ll be useless to 99% of you on the account of it not having Windows drivers, but the internal condenser mic on that is great and the added ability to plugin a guitar and even a second external mic is just superb. There’s no lag, quality is great, I can pop it at the end of the desk and people can still hear me fine (albeit a bit roomy).</p>
<p>The headphones I use them with: <a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/digital-headphones-wireless-home-audio-rs-180" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en-us.sennheiser.com/digital-headphones-wireless-home-audio-rs-180</a></p>
<p>Great sound quality, no annoying cables to bugger me, no need to worry about batteries since the receiver station can recharge the headphones. The only slightly annoying thing is that I have to turn the volume of my speakers way up when I plug the headset into he control-puck of said speakers.</p>
<p>The speakers I use, by the way, are these: <a href="https://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/speakers/computer_speakers/companion_20/index.jsp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/speakers/computer_speakers/companion_20/index.jsp</a></p>
<p>And since you don’t expect anyone to watch your LPs and you’re just doing it as a way to spend time, go ahead. I just didn’t want you to get disappointed when your videos get 10 views (9 of which are by your friends or family).</p>

<p>Essentially, yes.</p>
<p>Thanks for the…1-2 suggestions about headsets. I’ll also look into headphone + seperate mic options as an alternative as well, just because why not expand my options.</p>
<p>As for LP’s. I know this forum is generally a bitch to get used to in terms of personalities, but I actually don’t give a damn whether or not people like them. I didn’t neccesarily ask for that.<br>
I’m not going to be screaming like a 12 year old girl when a spider touches her leg, nor will I want to get a job/fame out of it.<br>
It’s just a hobby to do, since I already talk to myself during gameplay, and I thought it’d be fun to just put it ‘out there’, even if like 2 people watch it and can relate.<br>
Don’t want to make it a big point or anything, so sorry for the mini-rant. It does get on the nerves though.<br>
It’s like when people ask about dog breeds and what they should get for their lifestyle and what people like more, etc etc. Then someone comes along and says “Don’t get a dog they’re a hassle”, or “Get cats theyre better”. Basically, offering opinions that weren’t really wanted/need for the topic.</p>

<p>I can relate to that, I understand you well.</p>
<p>If you have doubt for my suggestion, try watch this guy’s video.</p>

<p>So I simply went with the more expensive combination of having really good Sennheiser headphones (wireless) with an external condenser microphone. I use both the headphones and the microphone for playing guitar as well, so it was worth the extra cost.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree with this entire post. I personally am not a big headset guy.  I think just buying a mic and headset separate is usually the most bang for buck.  Plus when you have them independent of each other if one breaks its not as big a deal.</p>

            <p>I’ve had god experiences with Razer headsets, but they’re a bit expensive.<br>
Though honestly, you’re far better off just buying a mic and headphones separately if you want quality and for it to be inexpensive.</p>
