    <title>Source Recorder for BM?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-recorder-for-bm/10368</link>
    <description>There&#39;s a couple of things I want to record in game and when it comes to Source games, Source Recorder has always been the best.

For Black Mesa however, the standard H264 method doesn&#39;t work and I can only convert recorded footage into an image sequence. That&#39;s not too much of a problem considering I can throw those images into Virtual Dub. However, the images are TGAs which will absolutely rape my hard drive space.

Any solutions?</description>
