<p>Agreed. It also showcases the dub’s greatest advantage, making action sequences and scenes with unseen characters fluid. I watched 1.0 with subs and found the SEELE meeting really hard to decipher because all the voices sounded the same and I couldn’t tell who was talking.</p>

            <p>I’ve seen Death Note, it does have decent dubbing. Cowboy Bebop is… ok…   One Piece is like every other bland piece of crap.  I will agree with Studio Ghibli films.</p>

            <p>Of course, because you’ve seen every single US dub :hmph: . I hate it when people say that, that every single dub is poor. Maybe in the 80s but most of the dubs produced now (from reputable companies like Funi and Viz and the like) are excellent.</p>

            <p>it doesn’t bother me. most of it has to do with the fact that a lot of people who like anime do so because of their dislike of american cartoons, so the term cartoon has negative connotations for them.</p>

            <p>One Piece, in my opinion, has always been awesome but I’d say that right now it’s more awesome than usual. There’s a giant war going on against the strongest pirates and the Navy. You quit at that spot? That’s not very far into the series. And if you’re going to read any shonen manga you’re going to have to accept some bizarreness. Here’s a clip from one of the later episodes (which still isn’t very far). Spoilers though.</p>

<p>I had worried One Piece was going to go the way of Dragonball Z, but it seems to have been narrowly avoiding that route and pretty much remains the same as it was from the beginning.</p>

<p>I used to watch One Piece, and even read the manga for it…both seemed to start out fairly strong, with some mature themes…</p>
<p>But for me, it just seemed to all go downhill. Things started getting TOO wacky, enemies started getting TOO random. I quit watching the anime when it got to the guy who could eat things and turn into them.</p>
<p>You all seem to like it, though…did it get better after I quit?</p>

            <p>The comic isn’t making declaring them all bad, but more demonstrating how gaining mainstream popularity has affected them, Dragonball and bleach both started out okay at the beginning but steadily got too much into the “my powerlevel is bigger than yours! Wait, your powerlevel is bigger now? Impossible!” and Naruto went from using determination to find happiness amidst angst to just being straight angst. I had worried One Piece was going to go the way of Dragonball Z, but it seems to have been narrowly avoiding that route and pretty much remains the same as it was from the beginning.</p>

<p>Hint? This is the bloody fucking gospel.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s pretty easy to sum up. If you hate anime, then just take a moment and stop, and ask yourself something:</p>
<p>Have you ever actually watched a GOOD anime? Not the mainstream crap like Pokemon and Naruto and Bleach and DBZ that have long since thrown away any semblance of quality in order to appeal to the masses. I’ve enjoyed this stuff, but I’m not even going to try to argue that it’s higher quality than any other kids cartoon out there.<br>
I’m also not talking about the hyper pretentious bullcrap like neon genesis evangelion, Akira, Blue Gender, and even cowboy beebop to some extent either. They may be better quality, but it’s still full of so much shit it makes me choke sometimes.</p>
<p>The good stuff falls somewhere in between: Paranoia Agent is fucking awesome, Trigun is also awesome (which is probably why it’s constantly getting mentioned here), Howl’s Moving Castle is a strong contender which I’d even put above Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, the Oh My Goddess! OAVs are good but only get you 5 episodes, Ah My Goddess is kinda like a retcon of the series that draws more deeply from the manga, the first 5 seasons of Ranma 1/2 are pretty good though it doesn’t really escape the anime cliche’s at that much but it also was one of the older animes that was around before those cliches WERE cliches, History’s Strongest Disciple Kenichi is another one that has many cliches but still is enjoyable. Avatar: the last airbender is technically an american cartoon, but there’s some heavy anime influence there.</p>
<p>Most of this all boils down to the fact that while there might not be MUCH of a story to anime, there still usually is one. Most american cartoons typically have no overall storyline that would require an episode order, so no character growth, no characters coming in and out, and usually no sense of accomplishment as everything gets reset back to square one by the end of every episode.</p>

<p>Sorta like how in american cartoons when a character sees something surprising their eyes get big and pop out.</p>
