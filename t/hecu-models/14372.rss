    <title>Hecu models</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hecu-models/14372</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;ve been playing black mesa lately and I&#39;ve noticed something. All regular hecu marines have the same model, they all wear the gas mask and helmet. I remember there being many different models for the HECU, with night vision goggles, no gas masks etc.

The medics and commanders are fine though. They all look &quot;unique&quot;.
Thanks for reading



(Sorry if this isnt a bug but something done on purpose by the devs. Feel free to delete this thread if that&#39;s the case)</description>
