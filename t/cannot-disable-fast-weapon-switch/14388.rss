    <title>Cannot disable Fast Weapon Switch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cannot-disable-fast-weapon-switch/14388</link>
    <description>I go into &quot;Advanced&quot;  under Keyboard Settings, uncheck &quot;Fast Weapon Switch&quot;, click &quot;Apply&quot; or &quot;Okay&quot;, and then once I view the &quot;Advanced&quot; menu again, the box is some how [b]re[/b]-checked. If I leave the advanced menu and then re-open it without clicking &quot;Okay&quot; or &quot;Apply&quot;, it remains [b]un[/b]checked.

This wouldn&#39;t be something I&#39;d worry about if the weapon-selection graphic showed up on fast switching like it used to, but it does not.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, I&#39;m on the Public Beta build.</description>
