[b]What[/b]

A humorous remix of Black Mesa&#39;s &#39;Surface Tension 2&#39; track, where HECU marines and other Black Mesa characters narrate the proceedings.

[b]Why[/b]

When I was approaching the cliffs for the first time in-game via the tunnel where the jets go by in Surface Tension, nearby marines started randomly speaking in sequence to the music of &#39;Surface Tension 2&#39; for a few moments. After that I knew this had to happen, just more cohesively.  :wink: 

[b]How[/b]

All source material is taken from Black Mesa and its derivative sources (Half Life, Half Life 2). In other words, all material is &#39;authentic.&#39; I adapted existing work, but I didn&#39;t create anything that wasn&#39;t already there. All I did was modulate the voice audio in places and mix it in, and I remastered the track afterward. I didn&#39;t change the music at all outside the remaster.

[b]Legal[/b]

I make no ownership claims to any of this material. All source materials are the property of the Black Mesa Development and team and their respective owners.

[b]Permissions[/b]

Feel free to use this however you want, non-commercially. Just don&#39;t make any ownership claims that I haven&#39;t made and don&#39;t say you created it (unless you add to it or make a video or something).


Enjoy.</description>
