    <description>Unused Half life enemy?

A few days ago I was just being bored on my pc while browsing hl1 audio files.
when suddenly I found a map witch said: x. I clicked on it and I couldnt recognise the sounds. An unused beta/alpha enemy maybe? Im really curious. maybe you guys know what it is. (the location is: steam&gt;steamapps&gt;common&gt;half life&gt;valve&gt;sound&gt;x)</description>
