    <title>Server is changing level problem (srcds)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/server-is-changing-level-problem-srcds/9120</link>
    <description>I am searching for an answer for half year. so I geuees i try this forums too...

I downloaded hl2mp with hldsupdatetool and I use cmd to host my own server, but what ever game I try this problem applies for any source game...

If i use changelevel command ,server is changing level, but the loading text &quot;Server is changing level&quot; freezes for clients and they have to hit cancel, and rejoin the server !
It dose change the map, but ingame you have to rejoin, why is it doing this ?!

I tried to join not only from my host PC i tried it from my laptop and people on server confirmed it too.
No firewall, no antivirus.
I deleted all the addons sourcemod, metamod , and just reinstalled my windows 7 32bit</description>
