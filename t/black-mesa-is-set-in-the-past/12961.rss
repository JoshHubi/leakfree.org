    <title>Black Mesa is Set in the Past</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-is-set-in-the-past/12961</link>
    <description>Random observation, for what little it&#39;s worth - I find it slightly amusing how on playing through BM I realised what had been a near-future setting back when I first played HL was now &#39;alternative history&#39;.

I presume the devs were quite concious of this when making it.  Its all those bulky CRT monitors and beige boxes with 8-speed CDROM drives, mainly!  And no mobile/cell phones either!

Presumably these signifiers of a period setting will become more numerous as time passes and fashions and technology change - look at those out-moded MP5s!  Why did men in those days all have to wear those ridiculous ties?  Teleportation doesn&#39;t work like that!  Etc.

Mostly the age of computer games is indicated by their technical limitations, but I guess as with movies, it will soon start showing up in a more in-universe way.

(I note that the Lambda complex actually had flat panel monitors - bigger budgets there, I guess?)</description>

<p>I don’t think those got far past the concept stage, it was always officially planned to be the research station. The concept they changed was similar to what we have now, just much wackier and less serious. Also the scientists and guards weren’t on the same team. Originally the scientists fucked up, and the guards got mad and started killing them all, and the Marines jumped in to help (allied with the guards in this version).</p>

<p>I don’t think Islamaphobia matters when you’re fighting an alien empire for your rights to survive. Literally, the species is dead if they don’t fight, so I think they’re busy with other matters, like that. Besides, it’s likely any terrorists are either dead or stalkers, considering how the Combine treats active resistance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes sense if you think about it though. Black Mesa is a corporation, and a seemingly large one at that. Companies generally run their hardware and software for as long as it’s useful, unlike consumers who upgrade when something new comes out. Thus, CRT monitors and old Computers dotting the labs aren’t a sign that Black Mesa is set in the wrong time period, but a sign that the Black Mesa Corporation hasn’t upgraded this equipment yet, because it still does the job it was initially purchased to do, so there is no need to replace it. Newer computers can be seen in newer sections of the base, because newer computers were purchased for those areas as they became active, or because the older computers weren’t fit for the work they had in mind. As for cell phones, that can be handwaves by saying Black Mesa is in a desert and may not even have a signal. Cell phone coverage in 2003 was not nearly as good as cell phone coverage in 2013, which is what we’re thinking of when we hear “cell phone”.</p>
<p>The MP5’s were a design choice, an attempt to make a realistic version of the HL1 MP5. This version is reminiscent of the one from the film End of Days, but nonetheless is an MP5 featuring an M203 Grenade Launcher, like the HL1 version was. In actuality, the HL1 version was a generic MP5 with a sawn-off M203, while the viewmodel was an MP5-SD with a shortened M203. The more you know!</p>

            <p>It makes sense if you think about it though. Black Mesa is a corporation, and a seemingly large one at that. Companies generally run their hardware and software for as long as it’s useful, unlike consumers who upgrade when something new comes out. Thus, CRT monitors and old Computers dotting the labs aren’t a sign that Black Mesa is set in the wrong time period, but a sign that the Black Mesa Corporation hasn’t upgraded this equipment yet, because it still does the job it was initially purchased to do, so there is no need to replace it. Newer computers can be seen in newer sections of the base, because newer computers were purchased for those areas as they became active, or because the older computers weren’t fit for the work they had in mind. As for cell phones, that can be handwaves by saying Black Mesa is in a desert and may not even have a signal. Cell phone coverage in 2003 was not nearly as good as cell phone coverage in 2013, which is what we’re thinking of when we hear “cell phone”.</p>
<p>The MP5’s were a design choice, an attempt to make a realistic version of the HL1 MP5. This version is reminiscent of the one from the film End of Days, but nonetheless is an MP5 featuring an M203 Grenade Launcher, like the HL1 version was. In actuality, the HL1 version was a generic MP5 with a sawn-off M203, while the viewmodel was an MP5-SD with a shortened M203. The more you know!</p>

            <p>hl1 should be around 2003, and BMS did that time period lots of justice with the bluescreen textures and command line on the pc’s in-game, as well with the VHS tapes/players and old Sony TV’s seen throughout black mesa</p>
<p>the 7 hour war on the other hand kind of occured around 2010-ish, so society could’ve progressed before combine invasion at least to hl2’s point of 2023  (maybe combines drained the oceans so drastically westerners/americans/british could easily migrate to Ukraine/Odessa regions (since in hl2 the coast is called “little Odessa”), abandoning the resources of the west and having to make do with what they got in Ukraine and/or adopting combine weapons)</p>

            <p>Yeah. Never really occurred to me though it’s not all that surprising. The game’s supposed to take place in 200X (Which I would guess is maybe 2003? Something like that).</p>
<p>Hell, I’m not even sure of all the technological advancements we’ve made since then. The internet for sure, and computers have gotten smaller, and cells phones probably. But that’s about all that jumps to mind.</p>
<p>I wonder what all things got outdated as the time has gone by? For example, the computers they use in the AM labs are definitely dated.</p>

            <p>Random observation, for what little it’s worth - I find it slightly amusing how on playing through BM I realised what had been a near-future setting back when I first played HL was now ‘alternative history’.</p>
<p>I presume the devs were quite concious of this when making it.  Its all those bulky CRT monitors and beige boxes with 8-speed CDROM drives, mainly!  And no mobile/cell phones either!</p>
<p>Presumably these signifiers of a period setting will become more numerous as time passes and fashions and technology change - look at those out-moded MP5s!  Why did men in those days all have to wear those ridiculous ties?  Teleportation doesn’t work like that!  Etc.</p>
<p>Mostly the age of computer games is indicated by their technical limitations, but I guess as with movies, it will soon start showing up in a more in-universe way.</p>
<p>(I note that the Lambda complex actually had flat panel monitors - bigger budgets there, I guess?)</p>
