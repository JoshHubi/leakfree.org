    <title>Black Mesa is released!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-is-released/9488</link>
    <description>It&#39;s been a long time coming, and we had a rough start this morning, but it&#39;s out in the wild!  Black Mesa is released!  If you are having trouble with our mirrors on the main site, try the torrent, and help us seed!

More than anything, SPREAD THE WORD!  We are giving this all away to the community, but the best payment we can possibly get is that we get as many people to download and play this game as possible!  HELP US PROMOTE IT, EVERYWHERE!

Thanks guys!  Today is a good day!</description>

            <p>It WAS serving a place for discussion, but I can now see that it is less than useful and even though you know it’s already been released I can see why people might get overly excited by seeing new posts in this thread (honestly, you don’t think we’d make a new one to announce the next release?).</p>

<p>Why didn’t anybody post an update on Source SDK 2013 running Black Mesa Mod?</p>
<p>This will be my first time to play Half-Life series starting from the very beginning. That’s because I’ve been waiting for this Mod for so long since I heard about it in 2011.</p>
<p>Now as I’m about to start downloading it via Steam I heard about the 2013 single-player version of Source Engine. So… did anybody test it? Does it work without problems, or should I stick to 2007 version?</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">There wasn’t a need to post anything since it didn’t affect the game in any way.  If plays perfectly.  I’ve already been though the game several times so far, even posted a bunch of excellent desktop imagery and anaglyphic 3D versions of most over in my <a href="http://moddb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moddb.com</a> image gallery.  You won’t have any issues as long as you graphics card is strong enough and your drivers are up-to-date.</span></p>

<p>Stick to the 2007 base, the 2013 base won’t have the content that BM has to mount.</p>
<p>And just as a clarification, you mean download <span class="bbcode-i">just</span> the SDK base, right? Because BM isn’t on steam yet.</p>

            <p>It changes nothing for Black Mesa.<br>
Don’t search for the SDK 2007 Base on Steam. Go to you Steam Library &gt; tools tab and it’ll be in there.</p>

            <p>It is not the complete engine that you get as a Source licensee. It it still basically Source Mod SDK but they now host it on Github. Don’t get your hopes up. You still need the Source SDK Base stuff installed from Steam to run games (this includes the binaries like hl2.exe and a host of DLLs containing engine code that you don’t get to tinker with). The Mod SDK lets you build your own server.dll and client.dll. That’s it!</p>
