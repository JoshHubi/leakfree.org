<p>Well you wouldn’t nessesary have to play freeman either, I think in an open world game you would much more likely be a rebel of some kind.</p>
<p>The thing now though, is that no one at Valve who was an infuential part of Half Life is there anymore, so even if Valve were to bust out a new game, it wouldn’t be the same Half Life anyways.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s always good to try something new, but in this case I think it really isn’t necessary. It would just not really work as Half-Life was never meant to be such heavily RPG influenced, although being more open world would certainly be a good idea, focusing on exploration, as it has potential.</p>
<p>As about the player’s character, it would be interesting if the game had more SP storylines of a couple of characters (like campaigns system), featuring particularly those we have no idea what happened with, like Shephard and Barney.</p>
<p>There are many things they could try, these are just ideas (some better than others). But in the end it really is a big shame for the wasted potential for a great game that will never be made (also, it’s EP2’s 10th anniversary the next year. As we’ve heard nothing about the game by now, there’s no reason to believe we ever will). Just like you said, Valve isn’t what it used to be anymore.</p>

<p>Sell the franchise to Bethesda, I could wait 12 years for elder scrolls 6 if open world Half Life came out half way through the wait.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t know if Half-Life would work open-world. There is a set mission to do, I don’t think Freeman would be gallivanting around doing side-quests for random people.<br>
(This comment will probably be screenshotted and used in the year 2050 when HL3 comes out, proving me wrong if it’s open world)</p>
