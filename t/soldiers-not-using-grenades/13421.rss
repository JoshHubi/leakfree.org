            <p>Oh, and atop that, as long as we’re discussing needed AI fixes, I always hoped that the guards would have the same “dynamic interaction” combat abilities as Alyx, but seldom do I see any of these. The few instances I do see of guards struggling with zombies close-quarters, the guard merely shoves the ghoul back instead of doing any fun finishing moves. Even worse, oftentimes when these guards are fighting zombies or headcrabs, they don’t have a huge instinct to run to a safe distance before firing. Their encounters with Marines can be even more amazingly suicidal. I’m not asking our peers at the Black Mesa Security Force to have catlike reflexes, but I would love to see them willing to take cover and hide behind corners instead of just standing in a corridor slowly firing a Glock. I know that weapons are now mapper-defined, but I still think it’d be nice to see some guards choose an MP5, since at least it’s accurate in bursts.</p>
<p>These are just a bunch of nitpicky little details that I’d like to change, nevermind all the convar changes I try to make Black Mesa a little more like the semi-realism of Freeman’s Mind. At least, I think a few glock rounds should be enough to down a soldier, even if the nine-mils just hit him in the arm.</p>
<p>“UGUHHGH! MY ARRRM!”</p>

<p>Yeah, while I totally understand that it’s an attempt to keep them from blowing each other up, their hesitance to use grenades is pretty sloppy. All the flanking plus their instant reaction times (not to mention borderline hive mind mentality) just remind me of a more difficult take on the Combine from HL2. I’d love it if in the next release we could have more defensive behaviors, like taking cover and setting up a perimeter of an area instead of just running back and forth gunning at the player.</p>
<p>The grenade issue shows up a ton for me too, but it works in two ways. Soldiers rarely throw grenades, but are insanely adept at diving out of the way of my grenades, even if I’m tossing them up a maintenance ladder with their backs turned to me (looking at you, ST Abrams fight)</p>

<p>I agree completely. On a side note, does anyone know some good settings for the .cfg file to make them a little more bearable? I’ve been messing around with it for a while now but I’m not completely satisfied with the reaction times, etc.</p>
<p>But anyway, on topic, I HAVE seen some interesting ‘defensive’ behavior, sort of. In very specific areas, such as the first open firefight with the HECU in We’ve Got Hostiles, several of the marines would use pillars and hide behind them on purpose, peeking out of cover quickly after a few seconds to make a few shots at me, then hiding behind the pillar again. This happened a few times during my latest playthrough.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen, or at least noticed, the Marines do this kind of thing, so that was kind of cool. I’m still not really satisfied with the current marines, but that was nice to see.</p>
<p>They’re a little more bearable with the changes I made on the skill.cfg file.</p>

            <p>I think I notice them tossing more when there’s some vertical distance and you’re out of their line of sight.</p>

            <p>They do throw them, but it’s indeed very difficult to get them do it. I think they only do this if there is solid material between you and them and their path to you is blocked. For me, the best place to get the achievement was in We’ve Got Hostiles, try to break their line of sight by hiding behind some pillars and chances are they will throw a grenade.</p>
