    <title>Steam error</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-error/661</link>
    <description>Whenever I try to run steam I get this message:

&#39;&#39;Could not connect to Steam network.
Either the Steam network is currently not running, or your internet connection is down. Please check your internet connection and try again.&#39;&#39;
Wheb I press OK I get this:

&#39;&#39;Runtime error!

Program: C:\Program Files\Steam\Steam.exe

This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.
Please contact the application&#39;s support team for for information&#39;&#39;

Steam worked fine a couple of days go. I have never downloaded anything strange or edited steam in any way.</description>

            <p>It worked for me, but it’s more to help specific steam apps than steam itself.</p>

<p>I don’t know how that would supposed to help but I tried it anyway. It didn’t work. I think I’ll have reinstall then.  :-/</p>

            <p>You may try to delete the “ClientRegistry.blob” in your Steam executable’s folder. This usually fixes all problems. (You may have to type in your login and password again after doing this)</p>
