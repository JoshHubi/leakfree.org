I thought the hat will be found somewhere near the beginning in the game and that I&#39;ll have to transport it all the way through the game like the garden gnome in EP2, but it&#39;s located in crate in Lambda Core chapter. This would be much better and fun if we had to transport it ALL THE WAY, not just 5% of the game...</description>

            <p>Just finished a game, ye. Anyway, I took both hats along. There is proof:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Anyway figuring out how and getting them both through all those teleporters wasn`t that easy as it looks.</p>

            <p>What i did was enter the portals strafing and the hat close to the floor so it coudnt go flying so easyly but it was a pain anyways. When Steam version goes out i will use that save , to not go through that hell again. The hat teleporting issue was more anoying than the falling-from-the-car-gnome in EP2.</p>

<p>I can complete it without the hat no problem, but after dropping it about 20 times on the 1st platform and getting as far as 2nd platform once with the hat, 19 times without, I gave up.</p>

</aside>
<p>The second one is in one of the teleportation rooms in 247 puzzle (where you meet 2 scientists and a bodyguard) around some metal shelves over there. This hat looks identical to the first one, but you can’t unlock achievement with it.<br>
Well, even if the hat is found in multiple places, it would defeat the purpose of traveling with it through the whole game because you can just find it later.</p>

            <p>What about, say the area when you get knocked out? Unless they had some work around where it spawn there, an entire playthrough keeping an object with you wouldn’t be possible.<br>
I’d certainly be interested in it if they manage it, though. Little Rocket-Man was bullshit but it was a nice challenge.</p>

You know what, would be cool if instead of having that purple hat, you find the <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Ghastly_gibus" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ghastly gibus</a> of TF2.<br>
I don’t know if it’s possible, legal stuff etc…</p>

It’s unfair, you’re teasing us!<br>
Please…faster!</p>

<p>I thought the hat will be found somewhere near the beginning in the game and that I’ll have to transport it all the way through the game like the garden gnome in EP2, but it’s located in crate in Lambda Core chapter. This would be much better and fun if we had to transport it ALL THE WAY, not just 5% of the game…</p>
