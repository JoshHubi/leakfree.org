I sometimes sit alone at home playing games, but generally I&#39;d prefer going out and socializing, that kind of thing.

It&#39;s a good watch, kind of neat seeing someone come to a big realization like that.</description>

            <p>Thank you raw_bean, for injecting logic into this.<br>
And it’s funny to think of how much time the guy who made this video “spent.”</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As someone who’s barely touched a single game this year so far (a few brief hours to play through Mirror’s Edge and about two afternoons of World of Goo and Osmosis is the sum total, less than 8 hours probably) due to spending all my time socialising and getting to know my new special lady friend, I can stand up, hand on heart, and say that this video was a load of bollocks.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Games, schmames; ALL forms of entertainment and hobbies are the same, anyone that is lucky enough not to have to spend all their working hours working to survive spends the ones they have left on something they enjoy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mind-expanding or ‘worthwhile’ alternatives to such pastimes are not, for the most part, in any way intrinsically better. Reading War and Peace was listed as one example to do instead in the video, but although you may learn more history or be prompted to think a little deeper than from the average (but not EVERY) game, there’s nothing intrinsically ‘better’ about spending your time reading an acclaimed book as any other hobby. To refer to an example from the video, ‘I’ve read War and Peace’ is no more useful to put on a CV (resume) than an XBox achievement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you didn’t spend the time you spent gaming on games, I’d bet dollars to doughnuts you’d spend the time on something equally ‘worthless’ instead. The guy in the video lamenting all the chances and achievements he’s missed out on while gaming wouldn’t be any more likely to have achieved any of them if games weren’t around, he’d have just been lamenting whatever other hobby he’d entertained himself with instead. People are lazy. If you have time to yourself and there are fun things to do, who’s going to say ‘I must make sure I spend every minute on something I’ll look back on in years to come as being worthwhile, even if I’m bored shitless doing it now!’</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Bottom line folks, no matter how many languages you learn, how much art you ‘create’, what level of literary snobbery you achieve, you’ve got so many years and then you snuff it. Enjoy your time while it lasts however you prefer, and try not to regret a single minute of it. If that means getting out and sampling the world, raising a family, expanding your mind, or just getting really good at CS: S, really doesn’t matter shit all in the grand scheme of the universe: your life amounts to nothing important to anyone but you and a few other worthless humans either way.</p>

</aside>
<p>This, I like doing things outside (in the summer, Canadian winters… not much to do.) and I have some really good friends but socializing was and probably never will be my thing. Terrible stage fright, and given the choice between doing anything at home and going to a party, I will pick home any day.</p>

            <p>The one thing that pisses me off is that he blames video games for his addiction.</p>

            <p>I don’t really think my lack of social skills is the result of being a gamer. I just have a fear of social interaction with people I don’t already know, and as such tend to stay inside my “comfort zone”, as my school counsellor calls it. Gaming is just something to do, just like reading, which is not to say I should be doing as much of it as I do.</p>

            <p>People are constantly making choices. They choose the thing that they’d prefer. If someone prefers playing video games their entire life, then that’s what’s best for them. They’re enjoying life the most, not missing out.</p>
<p>With that said, I don’t spend much of my time at all playing video games =P</p>

Why the fuck should i be playing games or using the internet, I only used 14 years of my life and after seeing this Vid, I don’t wanna waste it all on The internet and games.</p>
<p>[color=’<span class="hashtag">#212121</span>’]well, maybe i do, but only on occasion.<br>

            <p>I think this guy should of emphasized more that he was a wow addict and that the bulk of the issue is due to MMOs. I will play Half-Life and mass effect 2 once and stop. I am anti MMO cuz the job of the devs are solely to keep people addicted. In Asia, they have already taken steps to cap people’s playtime in MMOs, how bout doing it everywhere.</p>
<p>I guess what I’m saying is, the problem isn’t games its online games and lack of disciple on the devs and clients part. Stick to games that have an end and you won’t go overboard.</p>

            <p>I liked it, I still have a social life but you have to think how many people play Warcraft and 2-3 make a level 80 account… I am glad he posted it because it is a wake up call for everyone whether they know it or not.</p>
