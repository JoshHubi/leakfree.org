    <title>Something I&#39;d like to share</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/something-id-like-to-share/3273</link>
    <description>Found this over at the SomethingAwful forums.

So this guy met a couple chicks on internet dating sites. True or not, this story is pretty funny. :3
[quote]
-Next girl is named Kayla. We talked for about 3 weeks over MSN and whatever before finally she asks me if I wanna meet that night at a local bar. Unfortunately, she wanted to meet on a night where I had to work the next morning at like 6:00am (used to work at a lovely ISP call center), so I told her I couldn&#39;t do it. She begged and pleased and begged until finally I gave in because, hey, she looked pretty hot.

I roll my rear end off the couch and get dressed, already half asleep, thinking &quot;this better be the bext drat date of my life&quot; as I struggle to find some clean socks.

I get there and notice her right away standing next to a chick friend. Hmm, ok, she brought a friend whereas I&#39;m alone. Whatever. So I go up to her and start talking, breaking the ice, and she looks at me and goes &quot;that&#39;s nice&quot; and turns around to her friend and keeps talking.

Unwilling (or unable) to take a hint, I just said &quot;well, do you wanna maybe go on the patio or something so we can talk?&quot;, she turns to me and just says &quot;we have nothing to talk about&quot; and walks away.

Alright, whatever, so I got blown off. It happens. I finished my drink and drove myself home. Oh, and I blocked/deleted her from my MSN and whatever before going to bed because I just didn&#39;t want to deal with her after that.

A week later she creates another MSN account and messages me, apologizing and stating that she was just having a bad night (oh ok) and asking if she can make it up to me. I say &quot;sure, tomorrow&quot;

I brought her to my place and watched her drink a bottle and a half of my Canadian Club Whiskey, and then she began to strip. Not one to miss an opportunity, I ran and grabbed my lovely cellphone camera and started taking pictures. I had her stand in various poses and take her pants off and all that fun.

Hell, I would post the pictures here just for shits, but I think that&#39;s bannable now or something.

The next day I emailed the pictures to my friends and emailed them to her as well. A week later when she realized that other people were seeing these pictures, I explained to her that her computer must have a virus and has become compromised and !!hacked!!. She believed me, and then asked if I&#39;d come over so we could talk about &quot;us&quot;. I just replied with &quot;we have nothing to talk about&quot; and deleted her.

            <p>I’ve yet to find one thread in these forums without an off-topic post.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think that if this were true (its probably not), then this is a cold thing to do. Sure, she was a bitch at the bar, but if you have nothing better to do then get revenge like this, you have some serious issues. Just… tell her over MSN that you were offended at the bar and have no intention of talking to her again.</p>

            <p>Found this over at the SomethingAwful forums.</p>
<p>So this guy met a couple chicks on internet dating sites. True or not, this story is pretty funny. :3</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>-Next girl is named Kayla. We talked for about 3 weeks over MSN and whatever before finally she asks me if I wanna meet that night at a local bar. Unfortunately, she wanted to meet on a night where I had to work the next morning at like 6:00am (used to work at a lovely ISP call center), so I told her I couldn’t do it. She begged and pleased and begged until finally I gave in because, hey, she looked pretty hot.</p>
<p>I roll my rear end off the couch and get dressed, already half asleep, thinking “this better be the bext drat date of my life” as I struggle to find some clean socks.</p>
<p>I get there and notice her right away standing next to a chick friend. Hmm, ok, she brought a friend whereas I’m alone. Whatever. So I go up to her and start talking, breaking the ice, and she looks at me and goes “that’s nice” and turns around to her friend and keeps talking.</p>
<p>Unwilling (or unable) to take a hint, I just said “well, do you wanna maybe go on the patio or something so we can talk?”, she turns to me and just says “we have nothing to talk about” and walks away.</p>
<p>Alright, whatever, so I got blown off. It happens. I finished my drink and drove myself home. Oh, and I blocked/deleted her from my MSN and whatever before going to bed because I just didn’t want to deal with her after that.</p>
<p>A week later she creates another MSN account and messages me, apologizing and stating that she was just having a bad night (oh ok) and asking if she can make it up to me. I say “sure, tomorrow”</p>
<p>I brought her to my place and watched her drink a bottle and a half of my Canadian Club Whiskey, and then she began to strip. Not one to miss an opportunity, I ran and grabbed my lovely cellphone camera and started taking pictures. I had her stand in various poses and take her pants off and all that fun.</p>
<p>Hell, I would post the pictures here just for shits, but I think that’s bannable now or something.</p>
<p>The next day I emailed the pictures to my friends and emailed them to her as well. A week later when she realized that other people were seeing these pictures, I explained to her that her computer must have a virus and has become compromised and !!hacked!!. She believed me, and then asked if I’d come over so we could talk about “us”. I just replied with “we have nothing to talk about” and deleted her.</p>
