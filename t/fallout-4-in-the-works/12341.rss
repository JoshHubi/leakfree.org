            <p>If you want threads locked (we don’t have time to read EVERYTHING and some threads/forums are priorities because of the likelihood of ‘disagreements’) then you’re best of using the handy REPORT button and we’ll look at this.</p>
<p>But you’re absolutely right in this case, nothing at all relevant going on in here now so I’ll lock it.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, this thread had all kinda potential to stay on topic anyways.  Fallout 4 annouced! Anything else? No? What discuss? Other fallout stuff.</p>
<p>I think its really fucking stupid when companies announce games that everyone knows they’re working but don’t have anything to show.  Its not even as though an announcement means anything since I’ve heard of plenty of titles that get announced and then never come out.</p>

            <p>Well, the thread no longer has a topic and has devolved into this.</p>
<p>I’d suggest locking it, but when was the last time that happened?</p>

            <p>I hope they add Iron sight and weapon customization to this one. Obsidian did it well in FO:NV and I felt it really added immersion.<br>
Not to forget is that I played FO3 for this first time this spring and I was dissapointed when there was no Iron sights. Mods fixed that though, together with faulty animation and higher textures.</p>

            <p>Theres a headbob command that lets you turn it down with a value (or turn it off), and most of the learning curve comes from avoiding anomalies and not rushing headfirst into firefights. Last year I played it through on master, and while I had trouble getting into it once it came out, once I got to some of the areas past the starter area I couldn’t put it down.</p>

            <p>^There are sprint mods for both FO3 and NV.  They’re a must as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p>While we’re sort of talking about Stalker, I’ve tried to start SoC twice now and just been spooked off by the learning curve each time.  Is it as bad as it seems from the tutorial?</p>
<p>Also, that fucking head bob.</p>

            <p>Considering Fallout is becoming more of a FPS lately<br>
All I want is a damn sprint button, hopefully affected by Agility and Endurance stats. And a more refined V.A.T.S. with more things that can be done with it, like ducking or being able to move using your AP, making combat a little more strategic.</p>

<p>Joking aside, I suggest you play the first game first. While rougher with animations and some other shit it does a much better job of introducing the player to the game mechanics and how the world works, and it’s overall a lot more memorable.</p>
<p>That’s not to say Call of Pripyat is bad, it’s great, and it has tons of upsides (like better side quests, world is a lot more open) but the first game has a charm about it that you don’t find in many others, and it really sticks with you, especially if you like atmosphere.</p>

<p>Yeah, I said CoP because I have no idea which of the games are supposed to be good or what.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the advice, though.</p>

<p>Stalker SoC is probably in my top ten of all time list (if I ever sat down and figured out what it was). It’s an amazingly immersive, super challenging, and very rewarding game. Just awesome. Except the last two hours of the “true” ending. That crap sucks.</p>
<p>It should scratch the Fallout 4 itch, then go straight through the epidermis and into deep bone tissue.</p>

<p>I hate accidentally picking up tankards or wooden bowls when I’m reaching for a coin purse.<br>
Or, you know, empty bottles or toy cars when I’m reaching for a box of bullets. Since this is the Fallout 4 thread.</p>

<p>This sort of thing would be less annoying if Bethesda’s recent UIs were better designed.</p>
