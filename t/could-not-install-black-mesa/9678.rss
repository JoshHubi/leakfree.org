    <title>Could not install Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/could-not-install-black-mesa/9678</link>
    <description>I am running windows XP, and during the set up of Black Mesa Source where I was to choose an install destination, I could not progress. Due to my C: drive being full, I tried to install in my D : and back-up E: drive, both of which had plenty of space. However the &#39;install&#39; button remains grayed out and I cannot progress. Help please?</description>

            <p>Hate to sound like an idiot, but how exactly do I use this program to extract my downloaded BMS files? And how do I extract it to sourcemods/BMS since that file doesn’t exist yet?</p>

            <p>The installer is basically a 7zip extractor. You can alternatively download 7-zip (free) and extract the game data from BlackMesa.7z to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS</p>
<p>I have no idea why the installer isn’t working (it didn’t work for me either) but that basically gets around it.</p>
