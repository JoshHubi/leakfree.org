    <title>COOP WORKS!!...but....with random crashes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/coop-works-but-with-random-crashes/10160</link>
    <description>step 1: download this player model [url]https://www.gamefront.com/files/cf_gordon/;3752526;;/fileinfo.html[/url]

step 2: extract the files to your steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS

step 3: go to your steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS\CFG directory and open listenserver.cfg with notepad and change it to look like this

sv_lan 0
maxplayers 4
sv_cheats 1
sv_region 255
mp_flashlight 1
deathmatch 1

step 4: right click on your Black Mesa shortcut in steam and click on properties and then set launch options and add this line without quotes

+exec listenserver.cfg

step 5: now download tunngle or hamachi and launch the game and open the console and type in the map you want to play(the game will transition to each map from then on, just like in single-player, or possibly crash)

example:  map bm_c1a0a     (right after the tram ride intro)

after be sure to type  ip &quot;type your hamachi or tunngle IP address here&quot;   without quotes

step 6: get your friends to download tunngle or hamachi and connect using the console (connect &quot;hamachi/tunngle IP here&quot; without quotes) now have fun!

            <p>Doesn’t matter anymore, the steam version now has official deathmatch support, which means working character models! Only now you can’t pickup objects, only crowbar them out of the way.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">        I would recommend getting that and using the console while hosting a match and switch to a single-player map and cooping that way. It crashes a lot less now, mostly only when you touch a barnacle’s tongue or when a scripted event goes out of order in the map, So you have to try and not skip(noclip) over any rooms, that mean even if you crash, play it over again, each time you crash and host the game again you can’t skip any rooms and places with explosions or npc’s trying to talk to you. If you die though THEN IT’S OK TO NOCLIP, you can respawn and noclip back to where you were at.</p>
<p>NOTE: IF you try and host a coop game directly through console in the steam version now before hosting a deathmatch game FIRST, it’ll make the npc’s drop dead half way through their speeches, still don’t know why, but just HOST A NORMAL DEATH-MATCH GAME FIRST from the menu and this shouldn’t happen anymore.</p>

            <p>Um… can anyone play co-op with me? All my Steam friends are either offline, busy, or don’t have the required programs and files and can’t download them.<br>
EDIT: Damn. It works, but none of my friends can connect.</p>

            <p>I have port forwarded a source port 27015 and 27020 does that mean I can connect using my external ip. It works for gmod and synergy servers so should it work for bms too?</p>

</aside>
<p>good to hear!, also if using sv_lan 0 and playing locally between computers tends to crash ALOT, try using hamachi or tunngle like I stated in my guide and make sure you change the servers ip to the one used by either of those programs, I have reason to believe it crashes less that way  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
