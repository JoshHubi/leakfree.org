    <description>Hello, I just loaded a game of Opposing Force and i noticed there was no sound. I checked the game&#39;s sound levels and they were fine. I checked my computer sound levels and they were fine. It even says that the speakers are registering sound but i&#39;m not hearing anything. Does anyone know how to fix this? :[</description>

<p>Turn your speakers on?</p>

</aside>
<p>I just figured out somehow the cable connecting to my speakers came lose. I dont know how this happened. It isn’t even a cable really. It’s like a small black box with a cable coming from the inside of it, running into the speaker port. Here’s a picture: <a href="https://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/mellin/arch671/winter2004/student/Morris/pics/A2-black-box-pic-2.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/mellin/arch671/winter2004/student/Morris/pics/A2-black-box-pic-2.jpg</a></p>
<p>Imagine that made out of plastic with a cable coming out of the hole in the side.<br>
It is also very heavy and was put in securely.</p>
