    <title>Controller vs. Mouse + Keyboard</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/controller-vs-mouse-keyboard/3075</link>
    <description>I find it damn hard to play with a controller when it comes to a FPS game(i dont own an Xbox but i play on my friends one). Why is it that people still use the controller? I find it slower than the mouse when it comes to looking around and specially when someones shooting at you. Do you guys do it out of tradition?  :stuck_out_tongue: 

Chill, im not ranting against controllers or people who use them, im just curious and i want to know why. Would you guys prefer to use a plug that allows you to play with a mouse and keyboard like [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9fzM6FlZRM&#39;]this[/url]? Or do you think the controller is more elite than keyboard and mouse?

Is the XFPS reliable and would u get instant reactions when using it?</description>

<p>I however would and do prefer a keyboard over a gamepad for racing games. I just have a much quicker reaction time with a keyboard then I do with a gamepad.</p>

</aside>
<p>Exactly. I find the same is true for analog movement, though obviously not as big of a deal as mouse-controller-aim, but that’s why I play gamepad + mouse is so I don’t lose either.</p>

            <p>Gamepads are good for <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> game types. RTS? Dear GOD no. FPS? Eh, without auto aim you’re fairly fecked. Fighting games? Go for your life. Racing games? Probably a tie with keyboard; go for a wheel for realism, but stay with either for playability. The only thing that irks me is when companies try using the gamepad for gametypes it was plainly not made for. RTS’s on consoles <span class="bbcode-i">do not work</span> for that very reason.</p>

            <p>I didn’t mean to start another never ending console vs. PC debate. I just meant that it is that if you do have a split screen game  on PC and multiple mice +keyboards it is much more difficult to find space for them as they are several times larger than a controller that you can hold pretty much anywhere.</p>

<p>I am prepared to get flamed, I actually prefer the controller over mouse and keyboard for all types of games apart from RTS. I find them much easier to use and keyboards have too many keys, you can press the wrong button all the time, and they are not very ergonomic.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I feel exactly the same.</p>
<p>I can play on both pretty well. However, I think I am on the only person who prefers a controller over a keyboard + mouse. Reasons:</p>
<p>1.All the controls are compact and easy to reach<br>
2.You don’t have to worry about pressing the wrong key(they all feel the same)<br>
3.For travel or going to a friends house it is easier to carry a controller<br>
4.To play multiplayer with friends find another controller or buy another computer<br>
5.In shooters change pressure on joystick on computer press 2 keys at once</p>
<p>In the end I can use both but if given the choice I would take a controller. Maybe its just that I grew up on consoles but I do play better on consoles than PCs.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I personally think it’s what you’re used to, or what your gaming habits started with.</p>
<p>For me it’s Keyboard &amp; Mouse for FPS games, Strategy games and some other select genres. For certain games though, a gamepad is the way to go because the game was <span class="bbcode-i">designed</span> for it i.e. Assassin’s Creed. Psychonauts was a whole lot easier too with my gamepad than with my mouse &amp; keyboard.</p>
<p>My friend too would agree, he bought the OB for his PS3 and prefers TF2 on the PC because he found it easier to aim(not to mention hardly any FPS issues, more content and less bugs).</p>
<p>For racing games, I cannot stress this enough, a <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">good</span></span> FFB wheel is needed otherwise you will not get the car correcting itself which can lead to crashing/spinning out. I went from Keyboard straight to FFB Wheel and the difference is amazing, it’s so much easier to race with the wheel than the keyboard/a gamepad.</p>
<p>For Flight Simulators, a joystick is a must otherwise you end up… ahem… unable to fly properly.</p>
<p>All in all, I think it mainly comes down to if the game was designed for a gamepad/joystick/steering wheel or keyboard and mouse. Some games just play better on a gamepad than a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>I expect to be flamed now :3</p>

            <p>Yeah I know you can reconfigure the keys, but I just find controllers easier to use and I like the analogue movement. I suppose it is the fact that I have used controllers for about 10 years and a keyboard for 1.</p>

            <p>You do know you can reconfigure the keys?</p>
<p>The only thing I prefer the controller for are fighting games. You can play them with the mouse and keyboard but since fighting games are mostly in 2D planes (for movement, not graphics per se) the mouse offers no real advantage, and the keyboard is just too unwieldy for the twitch combos.</p>

            <p>I am prepared to get flamed, I actually prefer the controller over mouse and keyboard for all types of games apart from RTS. I find them much easier to use and keyboards have too many keys, you can press the wrong button all the time, and they are not very ergonomic.</p>

<p>Yes, because it’s totally a problem with controllers when the whole damn controller is vibrating. :retard:</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>of course it’s not a problem with controllers. You hold a controller in your hand and so when it vibrates, your hand moves with the vibration and results in no relative motion between your hand and the controller. A keyboard rests under your hand with your fingers resting on the keys, so your hand isn’t going to move with the vibration which will result in relative motion between your hand and the keyboard when it vibrates.</p>

<p>How can you people say controllers are the best input device for driving games? Flight sims and racing games are best played using steering wheels and joysticks.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Certainly, but this is mouse+kb vs controller, so in the context of that comparison an analog gamepad will win out over mouse+kb, and as Siggs just pointed out, even including steering wheels and such, they still are generally categorized under specialty gamepads rather than mouse+kb.</p>

<p>Controllers really only have two kinds of game that they are exclusive to: Platformers and fighting games. I played the Matrix Path of Neo on PC, and I must say it felt incredibly awkward to use WASD to finish off combos.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just as Mouse only has 2 types of games that it is excusive to; RTS and FPS (NOTE: I still feel FPS is best played through combination of mouse+Gamepad NOT keyboard)</p>
<p>Just about every other game can be played interchangeably and is merely a matter of which you are more comfortable using.</p>

<p>I completely agree, but I classed steering wheels under controllers  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
