    <description>Great movie. Many possibilities, and many points of discussion.

*SPOILER ALERT* spoilers may be possible, so if you haven&#39;t seen the movie, read with extreme caution.

The only thing I wanted more out of the movie, were more trippy enviroments. The paris expose was great. loved every second of it. (But I guess I know that they had to keep everything looking realistic for the target...still. Wanted to see more of those paradoxes in action  :slight_smile: )</description>

            <p>That would hurt. A lot. But damn if that wouldn’t be good training and be as good as the real thing, then I don’t know what is. Imagine with all that compounded time, how much experience you’ll gain.</p>
<p>And while typing I just made a connection that dreaming = hyperbolic time chamber in dragonball z.<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> Only you can go deeper, and there are hyperbolic chambers inside hyperbolic chambers.</p>

            <p>He did mention that the shared dreaming thing was made so soldiers could practice on each other without having to worry about killing each other. I think that’d be pretty cool if we could do that in real life  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  .</p>

            <p>And for some reason I kept on thinking that he(the director) was also alluding to video games as a kind of dreaming for some reason…that scene with all those old people sleeping underground seemed to evoke a kind of Dreaming LAN party…maybe I’m reading too much into it, but it’s interesting to think of it that way.</p>

            <p>Yeah, more dreamscape like things would have been cool but the relative realism of the dreams I liked.</p>
<p>An EXTREMELY good movie, I’ve got to say. My favorite movie, actually. I’m a really big fan of multiple storylines and this movie played on that to the extreme. The time differences between each dream level made it a lot more enjoyable as well. I’m definitely getting the Blu-Ray when it comes out.</p>
<p>The ending was just holy shit. I’ve seen a lot of theories floating around on it too, one of which has to do with Cobb’s wedding ring.</p>
<p>Am I allowed to post spoilers in here?</p>
