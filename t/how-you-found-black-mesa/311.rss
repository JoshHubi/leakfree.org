    <title>How you found Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-you-found-black-mesa/311</link>
    <description>Tell us how you found Black Mesa in the first place. And maybe a date to go with it.  :smiley: 


Personally, I found Black Mesa when reading up about hacking techniques (I&#39;m just interested for you troll&#39;s out there). I saw that someone had hacked the Black Mesa website in an attempt to get some attention. I searched up Black Mesa, took a look and liked it. Then proceeding to forget about it for a year or so. I found it again in late 2007, and here I am.</description>

            <p>If it’s any consolation most of the members that have been here for a while are smarter than a large portion of my RL friends and I have spent a lot of time on my computer over the years so It’s probably a similar situation.</p>
<p>Though to be fair, I actually have been on my computer a lot less lately, a side effect of discovering the joys of actually having a life outside video games.</p>

            <p>Personally, I’m glad Catz is back. I like seeing the rest of the old forumites getting back together over common interests- namely the impending release of the mod.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, I’ve probably hung out with this forum more than my actual real life friends in terms of sheer time invested.</p>
<p>I know, I know, I need a life. Working on it. But it’s nice to have a set of vitriolic, boisterous friends I can talk to at any time on my computer despite being strangers scattered across the world. Heck, some of my irl friends call me by my net handle instead of my name sometimes.</p>

            <p>I like catz, but I have to admit the backlash against her around the time she left was at least partially deserved (although greatly exaggerated). Anywhooo… water under the bridge :d</p>

            <p>I think I was looking for midget porn and happened upon a link about HL source, and then something about a remake of the original HL with the source engine that was supposedly way better than HL source.</p>
<p>So a few clicks later I ended up on an earlier version of the forum and liked what I saw. In retrospect if someone had told me it would take this long to make I probably would of lost interest in it, but then I’ll have to wait for time travel to be invented so I can go tell my past self to keep looking for the midget porn instead of investigating that link.</p>

            <p>Google. I typed hardcore porn and this was the first thing to pop up. “Black Mesa Source” sounded pretty kinky. I clicked here, looked at some screenies, watched the trailer, and orgasm-ed the whole way. I was satisfied both physically and mentally.</p>

            <p>I came across the trailer using Stumble Upon.  That was late 2008.</p>

            <p>I wanted to make good Source maps in Hammer. That never really panned out for me, but during my many Google searches, somehow I wound up here.</p>

            <p>I think I found it browsing the Combine Overwiki’s list of mods. The icon for that section of the wiki is after all a Black Mesa screenshot and I think that caught my eye.</p>
