    <title>Trouble with 3Ds max, help?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/trouble-with-3ds-max-help/12321</link>
    <description>so I made a short Video using 3Ds max, I rendered the frames as JPG images, which I believe is better, instead of directly render in AVI format, anyway I loaded the Images into RAM player and exported the finished video as AVI format, now the problem is, the Video&#39;s is very dark and almost black, why is that ??

here&#39;s how the rendered frames look like &lt;----- the way I want them to be

and here&#39;s how it appears AFTER being exported from RAM player =\

            <p>but my seasoned designers, which are also my friends and colleagues, recommended me to render that way, so I won’t face any encoding error and waste render time, I’m quite satisfied with the rendered results, but that damn dark error what agitates me, is there any other program that works like the RAM player ?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@TehBoxNoob</span> oh I’ve seen that forum, the number of replies are quite promising, I bet I got more replies here than any replies combined in that haunted forum</p>
<p>edit: I fixed the Issue !! all I had to do was to uncheck the “Gamma\lut correction” from the render menu.</p>

            <p>Render directly to video (preferably uncompressed .MOV, then encode that one to whatever filetype you want).</p>
<p>You rendered to a compressed image format and then rendered those images to a compressed video format. This just can’t be good for video quality. Additionally, image color profiles don’t tend to coperate well with video color profiles.</p>
<p>So all in all simply render directly to video (if uncompressed is too big for you, a H264 codec format like MP4 will do fine as well).</p>
