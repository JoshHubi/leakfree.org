    <title>Will HL2 work on my system?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/will-hl2-work-on-my-system/6219</link>
    <description>Hey folks,

Well, today I got my copy of Counter-Strike Source, and I now want to get HL2 (yay for having Source for when BMS comes out!), since I finally have a computer that can run games.

However, I have a dilemma. I know absolutely jack about system specs. Ask me what the stuff written for system specs actually means and it&#39;d be like asking a cockroach to invent the next space shuttle.

As such, I know not if HL2 will work on my computer (and refuse to fall into the trap of presuming because CSS works, HL2 will work). So, is there anybody who can help answer my question?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers, forum.

<p>Yeah, but isn’t there something wrong the Breen animation in the citadel, right before the end? Among other things.<br>
Also, HL2 hasn’t been properly updated to the Orange Box engine (HDR only on some maps, for example), and that patch does it properly.</p>

            <p>To know if HL2 runs on your machine, we need to know how many ziggamaflops your CPU has. How many megamebits of RAM you have would also help.</p>
<p>Or, you could go to <a href="https://systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/</a> and see for yourself.</p>

            <p>If you’re going to play HL2 I recommend you use <a href="https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1093025" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> patch. Last I heard HL2 has some awful bugs at the moment, which that patch fixes. And it also updates the graphics to actual Orange Box engine standards pretty well. Although I haven’t tried it myself.</p>

            <p>AFAIK HL2 was updated to the Orange Box engine (the updated engine ManlyStump speaks of), but I’m not sure if its enough to play BMS when it comes out. There should be a list of games needed to play BMS somewhere on this site, though.</p>

            <p>CSS uses a slightly more advanced version of the source engine(2009 I believe) than HL2. So if you can run CSS you will be able to run Half-Life 2. The specs for EP2 are slightly more than that of CSS, and those of L4D are considerably more, so keep that in mind.</p>

            <p>You shouldn’t have any problem then! But bear in mind BMS runs on an updated version of the engine, and its specs will be closer to that of Episode 2 or Left 4 Dead.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback, guys, and Diabeetus, that site you directed me to told me that it will run with the system I have.</p>
<p>In fact, for a computer which was the cheapest I could pick up less than a fortnight ago (only $500), it has enough to run HL2 eight-fold times. That really surprised me.</p>

            <p>Well, since we don’t know your specs either, we can’t really help! You need to figure out the basics at least, go to the Start Menu and Right Click on “My Computer”, it should display the basic info like the CPU and the RAM you have.</p>
<p>But since my 9 year-old Pentium 3 DELL with 512 MB of RAM and a 64 MB graphics card can run HL2 on the lowest settings, and I assume that your computer is better than that, you will probably be able to play it just fine. Maybe you’ll have to lower the quality settings, but you’ll still be able to play it.</p>
