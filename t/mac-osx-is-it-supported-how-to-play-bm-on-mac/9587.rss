    <title>Mac OSX: Is it supported? + How to play BM on Mac</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mac-osx-is-it-supported-how-to-play-bm-on-mac/9587</link>
    <description>Well hello there.

I&#39;ve been waiting for so long to be able to play HL1 and I don&#39;t have a working PC, the console needed to play HL1, and my Mac can&#39;t handle windows until I get a RAM upgrade and an SSD, then I find out about this mod and I literally cried in happiness. Then I realize, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s a exe file to download this&quot;, and I immediately go to post this. So does anybody know if there&#39;s either a download for this that isn&#39;t an exe file, or a program to open exe files on a Mac. If so, PLEASE respond to this as I&#39;ve wanted to play HL1 since I found out about Steam and HL2.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>BEWARE: playing it in OS X is NOT officially supported. YMMV. if everything else fail you can always try bootcamp.<br>
BEWARE: graphics/cpu minimum requirements are very high i.e. I wouldn’t even try with integrated graphics.</p>
<p>the short version:<br>
install WineSkin, create a wrapper (I suggest using a CXG engine), install Steam in it, install &amp; copy SDK and BMS, enjoy!</p>
<p>the long version:</p>
<ol>
<li>install WineSkin from <a href="https://wineskin.urgesoftware.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wineskin.urgesoftware.com</a> and open WineSkin Winery</li>
<li>click “+”, select the latest “CXG” from the drop down list, “Download and Install”. I used “WS8WineCXG10.3.0”, but feel free to experiment.</li>
<li>from “Installed Engines” select the one you just installed, click “Create New Blank Wrapper”. if the button is grayed out, click on the “Update”, wait for the download and try again.</li>
<li>pick a name e.g. SteamWine, click OK, wait a bit, view wrapper in Finder (I’m assuming it’s going to be ~/Applications/SteamWine.app)</li>
<li>in Finder: control-click ~/Applications/SteamWine.app, select “Show Package Contents” from the menu, it should show a Wineskin app inside SteamWine, open it</li>
<li>download windows installer for steam at <a href="https://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi</a>
</li>
<li>click “Install Software”, “Choose Setup Executable”, browse to the SteamInstall.msi you just downloaded, click thru install. login in Steam, quit.</li>
<li>open again the Wineskin app inside SteamWine, click “Advanced”. make sure the “Windows EXE” field is set to “/Program Files/Steam/Steam.exe”. quit.</li>
<li>click “Install Software”, “Choose Setup Executable”, browse to the BlackMesa-Setup.exe you downloaded earlier (of course, from <a href="https://www.blackmesasource.com/download.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.blackmesasource.com/download.html</a>), click thru install. do NOT select “run black mesa”. ignore “Oops” dialogue. quit.</li>
<li>open ~/Applications/SteamWine.app. sign in Steam, go to “Library”, select Black Mesa, Play. it will ask you to install the SDK. next, next, wait for the whole thing to download.</li>
<li>done! play “Black Mesa”</li>
</ol>
<p>hope it helps.</p>
<p>P.S.: as far as I can tell <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bootcamp</a> is the only way to play BMS natively on your mac. for a limited time you can also get <a href="https://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/download" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Windows 8 release preview</a> for free.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have Black Mesa inside of my Steam library, I followed your steps, I downloaded Source SDK Base 2007, but the game will not launch when I click on play. Any ideas?</p>

<p>They’ve already done that. The free version will use that engine version, the paid version will use a more fleshed out commercial engine version.</p>

</aside>
<p>Bootcamp is a lot easier! You’ll have to reinstall the 2007 SDK Base and the mod, but that’s really not a big deal. I’ve been using Bootcamp since I bought my iMac and I haven’t had any major problems. This also lets you play plenty of other HL2/2007 based mods that don’t work on OSX. And pretty much any other game that isn’t OSX compatible.</p>
<p>If you’re dead set on playing BM on OSX and can’t get Wineskin to work, then you’ll just have to wait. And that’s if the devs even plan on porting it. I haven’t tried Wineskin, but I did manage to get it to “work” by fiddling with the gameinfo.txt file. While it does load (after <span class="bbcode-b">many</span> crashes), it’s too broken to play. With the release of SDK 2013 (which works on OSX), I hope they port it.</p>

            <p>SDK 2007 will not be available on Mac ever. Mods that want Mac support need to move to 2009. Whether or not BMS ports to it is up in the air at the moment.</p>

            <p>I’m both a mac and windows user, but I only have a mac desktop and a windows laptop. The other windows computer I have is to outdated for this game, which is used as an arcade machine. But seeing SDK 2007 not being on mac but 2006 and 2013 is makes me ponder why 2007 isn’t .</p>
<p>The only thing I seem to be getting from any source i just dual boot windows which is understandable. But I don’t know if my setup can handle that. I hope SDK 2007 becomes available for mac someday. most likely not, but hey there is room for hope.</p>

<p>BEWARE: playing it in OS X is NOT officially supported. YMMV. if everything else fail you can always try bootcamp.<br>
BEWARE: graphics/cpu minimum requirements are very high i.e. I wouldn’t even try with integrated graphics.</p>
<p>the short version:<br>
install WineSkin, create a wrapper (I suggest using a CXG engine), install Steam in it, install &amp; copy SDK and BMS, enjoy!</p>
<p>the long version:</p>
<ol>
<li>install WineSkin from <a href="https://wineskin.urgesoftware.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wineskin.urgesoftware.com</a> and open WineSkin Winery</li>
<li>click “+”, select the latest “CXG” from the drop down list, “Download and Install”. I used “WS8WineCXG10.3.0”, but feel free to experiment.</li>
<li>from “Installed Engines” select the one you just installed, click “Create New Blank Wrapper”. if the button is grayed out, click on the “Update”, wait for the download and try again.</li>
<li>pick a name e.g. SteamWine, click OK, wait a bit, view wrapper in Finder (I’m assuming it’s going to be ~/Applications/SteamWine.app)</li>
<li>in Finder: control-click ~/Applications/SteamWine.app, select “Show Package Contents” from the menu, it should show a Wineskin app inside SteamWine, open it</li>
<li>download windows installer for steam at <a href="https://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cdn.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi</a>
</li>
<li>click “Install Software”, “Choose Setup Executable”, browse to the SteamInstall.msi you just downloaded, click thru install. login in Steam, quit.</li>
<li>open again the Wineskin app inside SteamWine, click “Advanced”. make sure the “Windows EXE” field is set to “/Program Files/Steam/Steam.exe”. quit.</li>
<li>click “Install Software”, “Choose Setup Executable”, browse to the BlackMesa-Setup.exe you downloaded earlier (of course, from <a href="https://www.blackmesasource.com/download.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.blackmesasource.com/download.html</a>), click thru install. do NOT select “run black mesa”. ignore “Oops” dialogue. quit.</li>
<li>open ~/Applications/SteamWine.app. sign in Steam, go to “Library”, select Black Mesa, Play. it will ask you to install the SDK. next, next, wait for the whole thing to download.</li>
<li>done! play “Black Mesa”</li>
</ol>
<p>hope it helps.</p>
<p>P.S.: as far as I can tell <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bootcamp</a> is the only way to play BMS natively on your mac. for a limited time you can also get <a href="https://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/download" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Windows 8 release preview</a> for free.</p>
