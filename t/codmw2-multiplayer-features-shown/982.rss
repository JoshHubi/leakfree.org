<p>No, the height of the series was Call of Duty. It won game of the year as well and was around before all these console style Call of Duty’s that completely trashed the gameplay that made the original CoD so great. CoD4 was not bad, but it was not up to the standards of the original.</p>

<p>Halo didn’t go to hell (In fact, I’d call it a game of the year if 50% of all people weren’t dumbasses, leaving the other 50% divided up into 35% dickheads and the remaining 15% people who actually know how to play). For the subject of Sonic, those games don’t deserve to be mentioned. They weren’t just milking the series- they didn’t even try to make the games (unless you count the vomit-inducing dialogue, horrendous gameplay gimmicks and intentionally very-nearly-mentally challenged and deformed characters as effort). Halo however made decent games like Halo Wars, and the Call of Duty series had its own decent games that could be counted as milking ( but don’t forget those were developed by Treyarch). Infinity Ward has a consistent record for games that don’t suck or are mediocre in any way, shape or form. Their track record is just as good as Valve’s, I dare say</p>

</aside>
<p>True, but they’re just overpowered. It doesn’t take any skill at all to throw your 3 grenades randomly in 3 directions were people may be and get kills. The game should reward a little more thinking, like more carefully thrown grenades where you are fairly certain an enemy is. Less range or less power. In the game world, they should be less powerful than C4.</p>

            <p>Shit man. I hope the game looks that good and plays that well when it comes out. I wouldn’t be surprised if it got 20 game of the year awards just by looking at those trailers.</p>

<p>The game will most likely be as good as the first, but I won’t touch the game with a $60 game tag for my computer. I’ll take my chances not enjoying the game and go back in time to the games I already own.</p>
<p>Fun, but disappointed in price increase. PC games are now being bound to a higher price.</p>

<p>Welcome to my world bitch. Every XBox 360 game is $60.</p>
