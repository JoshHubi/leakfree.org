            <p>My god, the freewill AI is horrible. I was playing as a single dude who impregnated a girlfriend who lived in another house. A few days after the birth, I went over to the chicks house to see how the baby was doing, and she just leaves her lying on the floor! She only fulfils the very basic needs of the baby like changing diapers and feeding it. other than that, the kid is on the floor all night, while the mum is at work etc. Criminal negligence!</p>

            <p>I haven’t found any bugs. Apart from the fact when you try to click something, Like Buy Mode, the cursor has to be slightly to the bottom left side of the button to click it.</p>

            <p>Yeah, turns out that version wasn’t completely finished. You’re missing a town (there’s going to be 2 in the final game), but I think you can get that by registering the game.<br>
EA said there were a ton of bugs in the game, but I haven’t found any, they probably just said that to ward off people from downloading it early.</p>

            <p>Arrested Development <span class="bbcode-i">IRL</span> anyone?</p>
<p>Yes, yes indeed.</p>
<p>Never ever understood these games, I prefer the games that take me on the more fantastical adventures or situations.  “Life Simulators” are ridiculous.  Speaking of, what’s the word on The Sim’s movie?  Is that ridiculous idea proceeding with production?</p>

<p>Sims age fast, but in this game you can change the rate at which they age, I set mine to longer then average (live for 190 days). The normal is living for 90 days.</p>

Turns out I was wrong, I think they all age at the same time, but switching between families is much easier now.</p>

<p>Because controlling them is the fun part of the game.</p>

<p>One real shortcoming in Sims 2 was that if a child made a friend when he was young, as he grew up the friend would stay young (if he lived in another house that is). Made for interesting situations such as an 80 year old man having a 13 year old as a best friend lol. Has this been fixed in Sims 3?</p>
