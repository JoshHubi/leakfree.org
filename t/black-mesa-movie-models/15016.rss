    <title>Black Mesa Movie Models</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-movie-models/15016</link>
    <description>Hey guys.

I&#39;ve been experimenting with Source Filmmaker and found out that the current models in game don&#39;t have an automated phoneme set.  Other than having to painstakingly assign each sound a movement (and in turn assign the model phoneme expressions), I was wondering if anyone (Probably BM devs) had certain models they used to make the trailer movie?  As they say, &quot;Work smarter, not harder&quot; and it would be extremely helpful to have these models for my project.  I want to make an animated documentary on a map I&#39;ve been working on based on a little story I wrote and showed some friends.

Thanks!
