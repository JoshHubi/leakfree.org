    <description>so,i have a [url=&#39;https://support.gateway.com/s/PC/R/1015332R/1015332Rsp2.shtml&#39;]GT5676[/url] from gateway,and i&#39;ve hooked up a gts 250 and a 650 watt PSU,but i fear something else from my rig is bottlenecking it,as according to most sites the gts 250 is capable of squeezing 45 fps out of borderlands in 1920x1080 but i&#39;m only getting 15-20
thoughts?

            <p>Most test sites tend to use a better CPU than a first gen AMD phenom 9600. I don’t recall if Borderland is multi-threaded, so I’m not sure if that relatively poor clock for clock speed is going to limit you to 20fps. Still…I would figure the Phenom could handle the CPU side of things… Have you disabled the onboard video?</p>

            <p>Maybe gateway wasn’t the best choice for a computer? I remember when I had a PC from Gateway it was nothing but nightmares, I had to format at least 20 times, and it broke 2 months after warranty ran out.</p>
