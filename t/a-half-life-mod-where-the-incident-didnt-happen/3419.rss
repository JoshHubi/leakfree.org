    <title>A Half-Life mod where the incident didn&#39;t happen?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-half-life-mod-where-the-incident-didnt-happen/3419</link>
    <description>You would play the game as is, but the testing goes fine.

But, your allowed to go anywhere in the facility without it being dilapidated.

Wouldn&#39;t it be cool to see the facility that wasn&#39;t screwed the hell up by the incident?

What do you think?</description>

            <p>I think it would be a pretty cool idea, i mean i always roleplay by myself in anomolous materials, and i was looking forward to doing it again in Black Mesa, i mean i would download it if someone made a mod like that, i see no reason why i wouldn’t, i think it would be fun  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>How about half life: Snark Invasion!<br>
It would be like this: the incident takes place, but instead of teleporting all those different monsters, it would just be snarks. alot of snarks. a SHIT load of snarks. It would have a gameplay mechaninc where you earn points by killing snarks and use those points to upgrade your fort in order to survive long enough to be evacuated.</p>

<p>Yeah, but then you get the hivehand, and it’s all like “why is it so easy all of a sudden?!”.</p>

 Comrade Tiki:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>How about give the player an inventory, and throw the character into the role of Gus. After the incident, give Gus a few surviving injured coworkers and scientists and some cowardly human grunts. Scattered around the facility, some holed up in various places waiting for the incident to pass.</p>
<p>Allow Gus to accept small missions in return for looty rewards, like STALKER, as the player is able to explore vast portions of the alien-infested facility, but doesn’t stumble around Gordon’s completely monster-laden campaign too much.</p>
<p>Gus should have a variety of outfits to don, including a green jumpsuit with yellow helmet, an orange jumpsuit with white helmet, a labcoat, the scientist cleansuit, a security-guard vest and uniform, a human-grunt outfit (which allows him to not draw fire from hgrunts if he remains at range) (gas-mask optional), and most powerfully but also attention-grabbingly: an HEV suit (helmet found separately).</p>
<p>Numerous little caches of goodies, along with places the player could stash excess gear, would exist throughout the facility. Further into the game, the player may swap his hand-held flashlight for a head-mounted one, and eventually swap that headlight for some head-mounted NVG taken from a slain assassin.</p>
<p>Some little quests would pertain to loot taken from the animals themselves - - a snark nest, a houndeye’s corona, a bullsquid’s tentacle, an alien-slave’s shackle, an alien-grunt’s hivehand, a detached live barnacle… things of interest to the science community. Why, there could even be a physics-based puzzle in which the player must capture or cordon a headcrab for further study.</p>
<p>Other missions may be like what was found in Half-Life. Turn on some power, clear a place of aliens, get to a stranded colleague and escort him back to safety.</p>
<p>The player could exchange a sporting crossbow, taken from a security guard’s personal locker, with <span class="bbcode-i">an actual</span> tranquilizer gun… in order to sedate and capture some houndeyes. (Bam, I just linked Questionable Ethics with Apprehension, and <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> by using Residue Processing!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>
<p>When the player gets to a certain map, human grunts will have disappeared, citing some sort of pullout. A map some time after that will contain a location which is so heavily infested by difficult aliens, our hero should be heavily equipped with the best weapons and items in the game in order to stand a chance. Just beyond this anarchy on the surface is an industrial sort of rail transport system servicing Black Mesa, and after making minor repairs (our protagonist’s auspicious forte), the player may mount up on this small train to escape into the sunset.</p>
