    <description>Hi u all,

Since I ve istalled black mesa, Ive had problems, it doesnt run properly , and I dont know why. Im runnin the game with the recomended Config and the game gets lagged in each crowded scenes.Ive been playing Half Life 2 with full video features, and It was very fluent. But same config in Blackmesa and gets lagged every fuc**** time that I play. Maybe its due to that the game is not compatible with my hardware ? dunno
My pc Features:
Intel core 2 duo 3.06GHz
Ati Radeon HD 4600 (1Gb)
3Gb RAM

What could be the problem ? Even if a chose low graphics it runs shitty

thx for reading !</description>
