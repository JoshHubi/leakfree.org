    <title>Can&#39;t get off the train after arrival at the beginning</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-get-off-the-train-after-arrival-at-the-beginning/9595</link>
    <description>Good work, guys! Good old HL looking really great now.

But: after arriving at the beginning, there&#39;s no security man coming and letting me off the train. Waited really long... can&#39;t even start playing, though.

Thanks for answers!

[b]EDIT:[/b] wrote this at 1 am... read it one more time now and saw that it sounds like a crying angry sarcastic child. Sorry, wasn&#39;t intended. There&#39;s really a great work done... I think everything works just fine except of this stupid bug.</description>

            <p>I have the same pb but I can’t open “Option menu” on the main screen.</p>
<p>I’m sure there is a solution, perhaps under stream options for blackmesa game</p>

<p>But I can’t activate the console because I can’t open “Option” in the main menu. Can I activate the console in option under stream menu for black mesa?</p>

            <p>Got it… the game needs Source Development Kit to be installed. Because there were some weird probs with my Steam account, it wasn’t installed automagically until I got the acct back to work.</p>

            <p>Guys, the most straight forward temporary fix would be to go to the console, activate the cheats and then use no-clip.<br>
But try unninstalling Black mesa and installing again.<br>
To activate the console, go to Options -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Search for the key that’s used to open the console (change it if you have to) and bring up the console, in it type “sv_cheats 1” hit enter and then “noclip”.<br>
Get off the train and go directly into the airlock. Then write “noclip” again to get back to normal.</p>

            <p>Removing the spaces from the path name didn’t change anything. And I won’t install the game to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\SourceMods\BMS since C:\ is a SSD with only 4 GB free space left  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>In the console, the following error msg is repeated ca. 50 times:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=‘Red’]CSceneEntity Sci40_Scene unable to find actor named “Sci40”</span></p>
<p>Is Sci40 the sec who doesn’t come?</p>

            <p>Haven’t heard of that bug before. Did the game get installed into the sourcemods/BMS folder? (exactly like that?) Most of the bugs involving strange game behavior, missing textures, or other issues related to content are because of trying to install into a custom folder that is not the default folder listed in the installer.</p>

            <p>In HL1, the sec came at once… there were a few probs with lifts, but above this it worked fine at all. Strange that I have to meet this bug here first &gt; <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
