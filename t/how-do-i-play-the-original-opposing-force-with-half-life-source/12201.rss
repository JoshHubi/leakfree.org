    <title>How do I play the original opposing force with half life source?</title>

    <description>Hi, I apologize if this is the wrong section to post this in, but I really want to play opposing force.  I have the goty non-source version of half life with opposing force, but I would like to play opposing force via one half life installation.  Does anybody know a way to do this, or am I stuck with using the goty version and having two half life installs?</description>

            <p>A lot of people prefer HL1 over HL: S anyway. The port broke a few things, mostly scripted sequences.</p>

            <p>^ what he said. It requires HL1 to be installed to play properly. You have to download both clients. If you don’t have HL1 (non source) it’ll automatically download the files anyway, but you won’t be able to play the goldsrc client of half-life.</p>

            <p>Since Op4 is an expansion for HL1, and HL: S runs off of the source engine rather than the goldsource engine, you’ll need to install the original Half-Life in order to play Op4. Sorry.</p>
