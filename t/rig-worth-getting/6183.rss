    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rig-worth-getting/6183</link>
    <description>So I want to know what you guys think of this setup I&#39;m thinking about getting after my birthday next week.
And I already have an Hdd that will do the work so don&#39;t comment that I&#39;m missing one.

It is as follows:
CPU :AMD Phenom2 X6 1090T 3,2GHz BE
Motherboad: MSI 870A-G54 AM3
RAM: Corsair 16GB (4x4096MB) 1600MHz VENGEANCE
GPU: 2x PowerColor Radeon HD6850 1GB PCS+
PSU: Fractal Design Newton R2, 800W(modular)
CPU cooler: Corsair Cooling Hydro H50
Chassy: Lian Li Lancool PC-K62
DVD: Samsung SH-S223C 22X DL

(sorry that don&#39;t link but its from a Swedish site and I don&#39;t know if it can be viewed internationally)</description>

            <p>Just have to add that I retract any statement I may have made recommending the i5 750/760 or Phenom II x4 955. If you need an extreme budget build, the PII x3 for $75 is a great value, but if you’re willing to shell out for the x4 955 or i5 750, you might as well go the extra distance and go i5 2500k or wait for the Bulldozer processors to come out.</p>

            <p>After looking at motherboard reviews on a few sites I think the i5-2500K with the Asus P8P67 PRO motherboard and 4gb of DDR3 ram is now on my wishlist!</p>
<p>Does anybody know if the socket 1156 is significantly different to socket 1155 in terms of slots for aftermarket cooling? My cooler of choice at the moment has to be the Coolermaster Hyper 212 plus but obviously I can’t recommend this one anymore due to socket type.</p>
<p>EDIT - Nevermind, lol a quick google shows the 1155 mounting holes to be the same as the 1156 so the CH212+ should fit. I should really stop thinking outloud in posts!</p>

            <p>Unless you need the hyperthreading for things like video editing, the i5 2500k offers an AMAZING value and will probably be part of my next build, unless Bulldozer is even better.</p>

            <p>Interesting, well Im gonna wait and see if I can get my hands on one off these new SB chips.<br>
What do you think the i5 2500k or i7 2600k?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>A few things:</p>
<p>-6950 is a much better value than a 6970, and crossfired its amazing<br>
-i5 750/760 (if the latter is around the same price) is the OC’able gaming processor to get right now, but this may change with the new Sandy Bridge lineup and the upcoming Bulldozer architecture from AMD. If you want to stick with AMD, the 955 BE performs around the same as any thuban 6 core since most games take advantage of under 4 cores<br>
-ASRock has some high-quality motherboards for very good prices. I would recommend the 890FX Deluxe4 for a high-end AMD build, the 870 extreme3 for a cheaper AMD build, and the ASRock P55 pro for an LGA 1156 build.<br>
-As was said previously, unless you work heavily in photoshop and CAD, 16gb is an IMMENSE waste. Buy two 2gb ripjaws chips at 1600 cl9 with an i5 750 and overclock the hell out of it<br>
-Good choice switching to the corsair PSU, 700w should be enough for your system unless you plan on crossfiring a 6950/6970 ever. With the latter you need a 900w PSU, and with the former a good 800w should do, at minimum.<br>
-The Lancool is a good case, if you’re looking for the Lian-Li feel. Personally I don’t care for their cases, and feel that for the price the NZXT Phantom delivers superb value, plus it often goes on sale at $99 and its a full tower.<br>
-The H50 is a good low-profile CPU cooler, but if you want to cut down on cost and have a case with a lot of room the Hyper 212+ would perform very well. Even if you aren’t overclocking I suggest replacing the stock cooler, it will make the processor run under safer temperatures, obviously, and will cut down on noise significantly</p>
<p>Why some of your choices aren’t so good:<br>
-The MSI motherboard you have has had some nasty cases of VRMs burning a hole in your computer. While this is rare, its not a good idea to run power-hungry Phenom IIs on a motherboard with no cooling on the VRMs. The 870 extreme3 I mentioned does have a heatsink on them, plus it has x8 x8 crossfire rather than x16 x16 which will help at ultra-high resolutions, like in Eyefinity.<br>
-The crossfire 6850s offer great performance, but the PCS+ is a poor choice. The voltage regulator on it is cheap and does not allow software overvolting, if you’re planning on overclocking (which is what the PCS+ is technically designed for). Buy some ASUS 6850s, or a single 6950 for now and crossfire soon after. The 2gb framebuffer on the 69xx series will come in handy soon enough.<br>
-The insane amount of RAM and the other stuff explained above and in other posts</p>

            <p>It’s not that RAM speed doesn’t matter but that you will rarely find it bottleknecking your system due to lack of speed. It’s more likely a bottlekneck is a CPU or GPU.</p>
<p>RAM speeds and latencies are more important to those of us who overclock. The lower the latency and higher the speed generally the more room you have to overclock the CPU as you can adjust dividers (getting a bit complicated I know).</p>
<p>It’s not worth spending extra on faster ram. With DDR2 the difference between 800mhz and 1066mhz is negligable, with DDR3 the same between 1333mhz and 1600mhz or more. I believe Tom’s Hardware had an article about it.</p>

            <p>I have 64 bit windows vista home premium, since my computer has a quad core processor. I kind of just got into computer gaming so im a newb to the more technical side of gaming. I bought a 4850 and as of right now thats good enough for me to play tf2 and starcraft 2 on highest graphics os im happy, but other than that i dont use my computer for any other demanding work like modelling or anything. so i guess my 8 gigs are overkill. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> if the speed doesnt matter why do people always make a big deal about it?</p>

            <p>Looks like a good deal. Remember to get Windows 7 64bit rather than 32bit (that is if you are planning to run windows, there are other OS’s out there!).</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bahrbarian">@Bahrbarian</a>, ram speed makes little difference to performance, capacity is the biggest influence and anything above 4GB is usually overkill for most users. If you are doing a lot of extensive music producition, video editing, 3D modelling then the more the merrier.<br>
Are you running a 64bit operating system? If not then you are probably only using 3.3gb of the total 8gb as a 32bit operating system can only address that much.</p>

            <p>So… my question: i am not an elitist gamer or computer owner. I have 8 gigs of RAM, ddr2, clocked at 1066 or something like that. Is having that much that slow a waste? I bought a generic bundle off of newegg and didnt know much about Ram speed and all this that you guys are discussing? Tips or pointers?</p>

            <p>I would recommend:<br>
CPU - i7 950<br>
Mobo - A good LGA1366 motherboard<br>
RAM - 6GB (3x2GB) - 1600mhz, cheaper and no point spending extra for faster<br>
GPU - You are on the right track imo with multi GPU’s as it is generally cheaper for the same performance. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.co.uk/gaming-graphics-card-recommendation-upgrade,review-32078.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This article</a> is a good guide for what’s best for the money at the moment. Remember also that at the moment the reference 6950’s can be unlocked with a simple BIOS flash into a 6970. Many have had success but do this at your own risk.<br>
PSU - Never heard of the make you stated but be sure to get a good quality PSU. Good ones are Corsair, Coolermaster, OCZ, Antec etc. 500w+ should be fine for a single card, 650w+ for dual cards.<br>
CPU cooler - Unneeded unless you want to overclock, the cooler you suggest isn’t too good really for the cost. A Coolermaster Hyper 212 plus air cooler will be more than suffice if you wanted to overclock.<br>
Case - Provided there’s enough space for all components go for what you want.</p>
