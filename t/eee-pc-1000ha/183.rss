            <p>I got an MSI Wind. Great for uni work (except for programming), but not much else. Screen resolution can be annoying sometimes.</p>

            <p>I’m on a netbook right now, Acer Aspire One, I use it for college work and general internet browsing. Costs £200 for one with 100gb hard drive, £80 for an 8gb hard drive. Mine has linux on it, Linpus Linux Lite, it has a boot time of about 20 seconds.<br>
Graphical powerwise, it can emulate Steam (But it is slow as hell) and run HL at full speed.<br>
Has webcam, mic, wireless, two SD ports (One for HDD “expansion”, one for file i/o) I find those useful as I use my SD card loads for my Wii and phone.<br>
I recommend it to people who do not need to play games and browse the internet (Facebook people, msn people) I have friends with beast machines, but they only know how to download and run firefox and msn, they have to get me to install adobe acrobat! Such a waste of money when this is £200 and fills all their needs.</p>
