    <description>I have 5 mouse buttons and want to bind weapons to them but they don&#39;t seem to be recognized by the game. I have an Anker wireless mouse and want to bind the side buttons.</description>

            <ol>
<li>On steam games library open up properties for black mesa —&gt; startup paramters ----&gt; add “-console”.<br>
Launch the game and the console should appear.</li>
</ol>
<p>bind mouse4 “use weapon_”<br>
bind mouse5 “use weapon_”<br>
bind mouse6 “use weapon_”</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Alternatively check your mouse driver and see if you can assign another key to those mouse buttons.<br>
A key black mesa would recognize.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be great if the steam options menu would recognize it in black mesa.<br>
Are you having this problem only with BM?</p>
