    <title>Fallout New Vegas Optimization</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fallout-new-vegas-optimization/5789</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know how many will appreciate this thread but I think it will be useful.

I just purchased the new fallout new vegas and had some HUGE performance issues, slow frame rates mainly. So to combat these noticeable annoyances I was relived to find out others were having similar problems, and was able to dig up two performance boosting mods that (no joke) tripled my FPS! Hope this helps those of you who have experienced low and inconstant frame rates, even with higher end machines.

Enjoy, without stutter!

<p>The first one in the thread is the one I tried to use, but it caused me to crash repeatedly.</p>
<p>If you saw my other thread on how my sound quits when FONV exits, you’ll know that crashing is only made 10x worse because each time it happens I need to restart.</p>

            <p>I can actually relate to you ar d:<br>
I had the same problems, but thanks to your guides, new vegas is running a whole lot better.</p>
<p>And btw, my lappy far exceeds the recommended specs, and i heard it had something to do with memory leakage, and face rendering.</p>

            <p>If your being serious, Fallout NV recommended high settings for my PC</p>
<p>PC SPECS:<br>
Pentium D duel core 2.6 ghz<br>
Nvidia 9600 GT 1 gb memory<br>
4 GB of ram.</p>
<p>I exceed the <span class="bbcode-b">recommended </span> specs, so that obviously wasn’t the problem. In fact I lowed most of the settings such as antialiasing, anisotropic, water, shadow, and view distance since these settings don’t impact visuals all that much. Besides Fallout 3 ran fine on my PC, so all I’m saying is that any new technology they implemented in fallout new vegas severely hindered performance on <span class="bbcode-i">my</span> pc. Some are having problems most aren’t. Just posting for those who are.</p>

            <p>You could also run the game at the settings it sets for your computer by default/ on a computer that exceeds the bare minimum requirements to run the game.<br>
Just saying, if the game puts your settings on medium, chances are you’ll have crap performance on max… :3</p>

            <p>Pretty sweet dude. I haven’t really any struggle performance wise, but a few extra frames never hurt. I know a lot of people who get sluggish performance with this game, same with Fo3. Nice guides :3</p>
