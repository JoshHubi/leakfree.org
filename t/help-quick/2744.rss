    <description>Anyone know a good piano synth program for Windows under $30 or free? Open source projects are ok, too. (And preferred.) Being able to use the keyboard as a piano is helpful, too. I know how to play, so if it requires piano skill I don&#39;t mind.

Help quick, please! Need it soon!

All help is greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>Garageband, Logic Pro, Adobe Soundbooth (not sure about this last one, but probably through a plugin).</p>
<p>Edit: Oh wait, Windows. Dunno then (well, Soundbooth, still)… But just go buy an M-Audio MIDI controller for something like $120 or so and use its software.</p>

<p>Alright, I’ll check.</p>
<p>EDIT: Nope, not coming up with anything. It can import wavs, though.</p>
<p>RE:EDIT: It can, but there is a long, complicated, process to do so.</p>

<p>[EDIT]<br>
I just looked over the feature list, and the site says that it can mix/export the MIDI tracks to WAV, WMA, etc.</p>
<p>“Uses Windows Audio Format Converters to import/export WMA and other audio formats.”<br>
“Mix all tracks down to a single .WAV file.”</p>

<p>Yes, I know what a synthesizer is, I just don’t see what you want from SOFTWARE. Also, how did you figure Black Mesa’s forums would be a better place than google?</p>

<p>I’m looking for a synth-emulation program usable on the computer. There are lots out there.</p>
<p>Google brought up a decent amount of stuff, but it’s mostly stuff you have to buy, so I was hoping someone had tried a program such as this and could make a recommendation based on experience, as I don’t want to buy a bunch to find out which one is best.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks, Will! I’ll try that one.</p>
