    <description>I was planning on buying a HL pack from gamestop, (all 3 HL2 games,  HL:Source, Counter Strike:Source.) and  i was wondering if it will include the Source SDK if I register the CD key with steam. I currently don&#39;t have a credit card so I have to buy it retail, and i really want the SDK.</description>

<p>ahh… really?<br>
if you get a sourcegame like CSS you’ll get Source SDK base AND Source SDK base - Orange Box?</p>

<p>We are talking about two different things here!</p>
<p>To play Black Mesa, you need the Source SDK Base (Orange Box) component (not the SDK itself)!<br>
And this one comes with every bought Source game, regardless whether it uses the Orange Box version of the engine or not.</p>
