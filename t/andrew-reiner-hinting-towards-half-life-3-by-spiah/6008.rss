    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/andrew-reiner-hinting-towards-half-life-3-by-spiah/6008</link>
    <description>This what I found lately at steam forums:

[i]Andrew Reiner, executive editor of Game Informer is hinting towards big news for their February Issue cover reveal. He claims that there will be 5 game reveals in the issue, one being the cover story.

&quot;The most popular cover guesses are TES: V, Mass Effect 3, and Half-Life 3.&quot;
One Twitter user, LeonSmrgshboard asks Andrew whether or not the big reveal has been previously announced. Andrew tells him that &quot;It is a secret I have been keeping since 2009.&quot; Both TES: V and Mass Effect 3 were announced at the VGAs last night! And while I may be alone in this thinking, 2009 seems just around the right time-frame for HL3&#39;s development.

While Browsing Andrew&#39;s twitter I have come across some quite intriguing notes:

-Big news coming on [url]https://www.gameinformer.com[/url] tomorrow.

-@MrTissueBox We have 5 huge reveals in the next issue. You&#39;ll find out what they are soon!

-@LeonSmrgshboard I&#39;ve been keeping this secret since 2009. And you&#39;ll find out our cover soon enough.

Whether or not this is Half Life 3, I do find it interesting that Andrew mentioned it as a popular possibility. Plus, with 5 games being revealed, could this be our moment?

Discuss.[/i]

I know I’ve been awful at changing the subject of this thread, but I don’t want it going to hate. So back on topic.</p>
<p>I don’t really think this is Half life 3 on there. It’s a popular guess because everyone’s so anxious for the next installment of Half Life. In my personal opinion, i think people having been saying ep3, but the news companies prolly just mistook it for Half Life 3 when they saw that half life had a 1 and 2 version.</p>
<p>I’m seriously contemplating that the civilized world might end before ep3/half life 3 comes out (next installment).</p>

<p>Many valve employees have been saying that the future of EP: 3 is looking bleak, as the whole point of it being an episode is to be released quickly and easily. This is not the case anymore. Even if it comes out with an episode’s worth of content it will probably be called HL3.</p>

<p>… EPISODE 3, NO HALF-LIFE 3.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Many valve employees have been saying that the future of EP: 3 is looking bleak, as the whole point of it being an episode is to be released quickly and easily. This is not the case anymore. Even if it comes out with an episode’s worth of content it will probably be called HL3.</p>

<p>Jorma Kay, if we were to replace the “K” in your name with a “G”, it would be possible to re-arrange your name to say Major Gay.</p>
<p>Think long and hard about that.</p>

<p>Now, how would that be a bad thing? I would definitely not mind, seeing as the most and major members of our community are openly homosexual,</p>

You see, here in the wonderful utopia they call the Internet, there are no rules and no one to govern or dictate ehnehthin’.

            <p>Angry noobie.  I can’t see HL3 gettin a release pre Ep3.  May just be announcing it’s existence and setting a road map out for the future.  Not that there’s any point considering valves past history.</p>
