            <p>It’s safe to play games while downloading something, but i wouldn’t recommend doing a virus scan while downloading. I had my BF2 update removed by Malwarebytes because it was downloading. Malwarebytes thought that it was a trojan, and automaticly removed it. This was when i still had dial-up (25kbit/s)   :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>FYI, network traffic is prioritized and delivered via pieces of data called packets.  So if you’re downloading movies and playing an online game, you have (at least) two sources of packets - from the game, and from the downloading.  The protocol in place (such as TCP/IP) will determine the priority of each packet and when it gets processed.  Thus, some download utilities (BitTorrent or uTorrent come to mind) allow you to throttle bandwidth usage if the system is not idle, and you can also set your router to prioritize data at the router level (i.e. assign no more than 20% of bandwidth to torrent traffic); this is known as QoS (quality of service).</p>
<p>Just a little edification :-).  In short, you’ll get slowness but (shouldn’t) get corruption.</p>

            <p>If you’re playing online then obviously it will affect the download, as in making it slower, but i have never experienced a corrupt download.</p>

            <p>Generally it will slow the download as the game will be accessing the hard drive. But if you have a fast drive (eg 7200rpm) it might not matter too much</p>
