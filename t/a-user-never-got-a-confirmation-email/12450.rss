            <p>if he’s using hotmail, tell him to stop using hotmail, otherwise create a new confirmation email and if there is still nothing, check the spam folder</p>

            <p>Although it hasn’t been reported on the forums, I think there was a problem with the forum’s email host or email setup in the period april-july.  If your friend tried registering sometime in this period, that’s probably why he never received any confirmation email. However, this problem appears to have been fixed now.</p>
<p>Your friend could try one of the following things in order to activate his account:</p>
<blockquote class="indent">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Request another confirmation email by using this form: <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/register.php?do=requestemail" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/register.php?do=requestemail</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sign in with the account he previously registered, and change the email address in the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/usercp.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">user profile</a> to something else. A confirmation email should be sent out to the new address. He can then later change it back to the previously used email address (which would require another confirmation).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>[NOPARSE]EDITED TO ADD:[/NOPARSE] Like sersoft suggested below, check the spam folder or try using an email address from a different email provider.</p>
