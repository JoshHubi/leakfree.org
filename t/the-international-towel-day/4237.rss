    <title>the international TOWEL day!!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-international-towel-day/4237</link>
    <description>did you know that today (May 25th) is the international towel day?
:fffuuu::fffuuu:WAT?! NOWAY!!:fffuuu::fffuuu:
this day was invented by &quot;The Hitchiker&#39;s Guide To The Galaxy&quot; (a book by Dougles Adams, if you have&#39;nt read it yet, do it now!) fans, because the book mentions towels, and in fact, calls them to be the most useful object in the universe, and it being used in dozens of ways... 

so, that was some background info, now for the purpose of this thread:
besides talking in a nonesense way about the specific day, i would like to hear some stories from anyone celebrating the occasion...

for example:
today i went to school wearing 2 towels:
One was pink, and i wore it like a long skirt (don&#39;t worry, i wore it on a pair of Jeans...).
Two as a toga, and it was blue. (I didn&#39;t wore a shirt :3 )
 :smiley: 
and after the school i walked with it on the streets...
...and only got beated up twice... :frowning: 
...
so anyway, do you have any stories?
============================================
also,
i have a cool idead for a game!
let&#39;s think of a houndred uses for a towel!

1. for cleaning yourself (bscly)
2. for wearing as a hat in sunny places
3. for sitting on sands \ other shit and not getting dirty
4. for hitting someone in the butt (make it wet, and it&#39;s X100 pain, and fun  :stuck_out_tongue: 
5. for choking people that just - won&#39;t - stop - TALKING :fffuuu:

now you name it, from my knowing of this forum, you guys will find a way to make this AWESOME
^_^

BUT!
remember to use the numbers so it wont get confusing and shit...

and happy towels day, everyone!</description>

<p>Really now, International Towel Day? Either this guy’s hopped up on meth due to his hyper behavior (One can only assume) or he still thinks storks carry babies and drop them down into chimneys. The only way this topic could be more useless is if he posted absolutely nothing. Wow, I’m going to crank up my treadmill and run through the stress.</p>

</aside>
<p>Wow you fail so much it hurts…</p>
<p>I can’t believe nobody reminded me of this! I got home after school today and about 5 minutes before I had to leave for work I stumble across this thread and discover it’s towel day. I am very disappoint.</p>
<p>To add to my disappointment, yesterday at Barnes and Noble I asked the Customer Service lady to help me find the newest book “And Another Thing…” only to be told it wasn’t out until June. Got home to find that the hardcover version has been out for almost a month (in the exact store I was at according to B&amp;N’s website) and that’s the paperback that’s out in June… grrrrrrr…</p>

            <p>did you know that today (May 25th) is the international towel day?<br>
:fffuuu::fffuuu:WAT?! NOWAY!!:fffuuu::fffuuu:<br>
this day was invented by “The Hitchiker’s Guide To The Galaxy” (a book by Dougles Adams, if you have’nt read it yet, do it now!) fans, because the book mentions towels, and in fact, calls them to be the most useful object in the universe, and it being used in dozens of ways…</p>
<p>so, that was some background info, now for the purpose of this thread:<br>
besides talking in a nonesense way about the specific day, i would like to hear some stories from anyone celebrating the occasion…</p>
<h1>for example:<br>
today i went to school wearing 2 towels:<br>
One was pink, and i wore it like a long skirt (don’t worry, i wore it on a pair of Jeans…).<br>
Two as a toga, and it was blue. (I didn’t wore a shirt :3 )<br>
<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
and after the school i walked with it on the streets…<br>
…and only got beated up twice… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
…<br>
so anyway, do you have any stories?</h1>
<p>also,<br>
i have a cool idead for a game!<br>
let’s think of a houndred uses for a towel!</p>
<ol>
<li>for cleaning yourself (bscly)</li>
<li>for wearing as a hat in sunny places</li>
<li>for sitting on sands \ other shit and not getting dirty</li>
<li>for hitting someone in the butt (make it wet, and it’s X100 pain, and fun  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">
</li>
<li>for choking people that just - won’t - stop - TALKING :fffuuu:</li>
</ol>
<p>now you name it, from my knowing of this forum, you guys will find a way to make this AWESOME<br>
<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>BUT!<br>
remember to use the numbers so it wont get confusing and shit…</p>
<p>and happy towels day, everyone!</p>
