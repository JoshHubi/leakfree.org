    <title>Computer Won&#39;t Start(new issue)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-wont-start-new-issue/5268</link>
    <description>So i have a problem with my desktop computer(not the same computer as in my other issue).
It loads up Windows XP as usual, and when it is finished, the screen goes blank, and the computer restarts. 

There is also two red lights lit on the motherboard, one just below the graphics card and the other is beside the RAM.

Reinstall won&#39;t work, installation freezes at &quot;loading info file dmreg.inf&quot;.

No BSOD, and safe mode does the same thing.

Any ideas?</description>

            <p>Here’s a funny thing.  The system I just built (i7-930 with 6GB G.SKiLL RAM) had an issue where Windows 7 would go into standby, then BSOD immediately upon resume.  I memtested each stick individually for 10 passes, no issue.  Then I tried putting the machine into Standby with each stick one by one, and lo and behold, had a bad stick.  Wonder what Windows’ issue was with that stick, since memtest didn’t care.  RMA’d the kit, new set works fine  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>As for the OP, I would agree that the LEDs on the motherboard were probably there to begin with.  However, I would double check the one below your graphics card - that may indicate that you need to plug an additional Molex cable into the motherboard to supply additional PCI power.  My old Asus A8N-SLI had that feature.</p>

<p>Also, I bet you those lights were always there and you didn’t notice before because you weren’t looking.</p>
<p>Also, if the memtest comes up fine, and it still fucks up, try taking out the sound card/replacing it with some other one that works/putting one in and using that instead of onboard sound.  Just saying.</p>
