    <title>No HUD, cannot jump high enough, weird sprinting/crouching</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-hud-cannot-jump-high-enough-weird-sprinting-crouching/9782</link>
    <description>Amongst other things.

So I&#39;ve had the HEV suit for a while now, got a gun, and have been killed, with no HUD. I don&#39;t know how much ammo, health or charge that I have. This is universal, not just in one spot. I&#39;ve restarted, adjusted visual settings, all to no avail.

Also I have found out that I can not jump high enough to climb on top of certain crates in order to get to airducts/climb over pipes, etc. I simply can&#39;t jump high enough, I&#39;ve tried stacking barrels and anything I can, also to no avail.

And then there&#39;s the running thing, I can&#39;t sprint if I press shift while walking. I have to stop walking, press shift, then move forward to run.  

With Crouching, if I press ctrl while standing still, nothing happens, I have to move forward just a little bit to go into crouch.

All these happen through out the game, not at specific parts.  

If you need any more information, let me know.

EDIT: Subtitles also do not show up, for anything, CC or Dialogue.</description>

<p>I have. No dice. That would make sense, except that the crosshair is missing as well. I have messed with about every setting that seems possibly associated. Now I’m re-installing just to see if my file got corrupted somehow. Thanks for the help.</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue jumping, it hasn’t impeded my progress because I knew to crouch jump, but does anyone else feel like you have to use crouch jumping for a little too much? I mean I understand that it is used to get to certain spots and all that but I am finding a need to crouch jump just about every god damn little ledge, am I the only one?</p>

<p>I am having the same problem with no HUD. I tried this command (as well as variations on it) and it had no effect. Any other tricks up your sleeve?</p>

            <p>Well thanks guys for the crouch/jump thing, but I’d really like to know how to turn the HUD on again.</p>
<p>Is there a HUD? Or is it another ‘feature’ of HL1?</p>
