    <title>Clarification Of Sound File Name</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/clarification-of-sound-file-name/11866</link>
    <description>I was rummaging through the BM sound folder and found what appears to be an error in a file name, as follows:

At location &quot;BMS/sound/BMS_scripted/bunker&quot; is a file named &quot;bunker_esplode.wav&quot;. Is this correct or should it in fact be &quot;bunker_explode.wav&quot;?

The &quot;S&quot; and &quot;X&quot; keys are situated very close to each other on a keyboard, so I&#39;m wondering if this is just a typing error.

Thanks in advance for your clarification.</description>
