    <description>I have this scene, but whatever I do it turns out really shitty - no variation in shades and no shadows, even though I turned shadows on.  Render:

[url=https://img835.imageshack.us/i/brokenw.jpg/][img]https://img835.imageshack.us/img835/2985/brokenw.jpg[/img][/url]

The light fixtures overhead are a total of 27 (9 per fixture) omnilights within boxes with transparent material and self-illumination.  These, as well as a test spot light within the room, are turned on, but you can&#39;t even see a hint of the lights in the render.  Any ideas?  I&#39;m killing myself over this   :frowning:</description>

            <p>stupid question but do you have the individual lights set to cast shadows?</p>
<p>Ill tell you how todo it anyway, someone out there might benefit from this.</p>
<p>Theres 2 ways of turning on shadows. You can go to the modify —&gt; shadows, ‘on’ tickbox. The quick way to edit basic light settings is this.</p>
<p>click tools --&gt; light lister. Theres a catagory called shadows. Click on the tickboxes next to all of the lights.</p>
<p>Now i cant figure out how to make the cast shadows blury like the skylight does so your gonna have to find a tutorial for that.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure what render engine I’m using.  I just click the Render button and the pic pops up.  How do I check?</p>
<p>I also don’t think it’s the matter of self-illum.  For this render, nothing is self-illuminated, and there is a spot light aimed directly at the fixture.  However there is no shadows cast whatsoever on the plane.  “Cast shadows” was checked.</p>

<p>Any ideas?  Thanks again double-z.</p>

            <p>Something is definitely not right there! It does look like some light is coming through the boxes at the top.</p>
<p>I would guess that the boxes are blocking the light entirely. Right-click on a box and disable its shadow casting. This will allow the lights to shine through, but may not be ideal for what you are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Depending on which render engine you are using, self-illumination might do nothing more than brighten the texture, and not actually cast light.</p>
<p>Are you using scanline, or mental ray?</p>
