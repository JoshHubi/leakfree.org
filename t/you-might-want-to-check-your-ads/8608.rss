    <description>I just connected to the main BM site, and got a full page replacement ad from some company wanting me to fill out a 4 page survey. It replaced the BM page in the browser window, popped up a smaller box with a &quot;continue&quot; button, and had a loud voice congratulating me on being selected for this survey. I had to x out of the small dialog box before I could close the main browser window.</description>

            <p>IE9 has been fucking up for me lately. (Probably my suck-ass computer) So I’ve been using Firefox as an alternative. Works just as good as IE9 used to to.</p>

            <p>Nope, in fact I find other browsers slower (Firefox takes a good 20 seconds at least to load. IE9 is instant and has been since 7).</p>
<p>And as for rendering speed, I honestly don’t notice a difference.</p>
<p>I use multiple browsers to test sites, so I have compared them.</p>

<p>Yes, It does solve the problem on a person to person basis, but the site staff should still be alerted to this intrusive/obstructive advertising so they can still get ad-revenue from the uninformed masses who don’t use adblock.</p>
