    <title>Flickering in Main Menu &amp; Windowed Mode Bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/flickering-in-main-menu-windowed-mode-bug/14250</link>
    <description>Okay.
I just downloaded Black Mesa, and I&#39;ve opened it successfully once so far.
On the second startup, the &#39;Loading...&#39; screen does not appear, and the screen is black with flickering bits of what looks like the Main Menu and the background in the Main Menu screen. It seems I CAN click things in that state - since I somehow managed to click &#39;EXIT&#39; without seeing it - but without seeing anything, it&#39;s virtually impossible to start the game.

The second bug occurs when I use the -windowed command in the &#39;Set Launch Options&#39; in Steam or click on &#39;Run in a window&#39; in the in-game Options (which I did on my first startup). When I do this via the &#39;Set Launch Options&#39;, my status color changes to green for a sec, then goes back to blue. In-game, the screen turns yellowish for a moment then the game crashes.

Anyone else experiencing this problem?</description>
