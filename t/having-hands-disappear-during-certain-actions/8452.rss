    <title>Having hands disappear during certain actions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/having-hands-disappear-during-certain-actions/8452</link>
    <description>I think that in certain actions your hands when holding a weapon should disappear in these situations:
&gt; Collecting ammo
&gt; Charging your suit
&gt; Climbing a ladder
&gt; Pulling a lever
&gt; Pressing a button 
&gt; Opening and Closing a door
&gt; etc.

I hope to see this in the game because it seems a little more realistic that way.

Comment how good or bad this idea is if you&#39;d like.

Update: I thought this idea was pretty stupid also.</description>

<p>So a handgun that can break your wrist if you don’t know what you’re doing, an experimental weapon with a ton of kick, and a rocket launcher which typically needs two hands to steady are all wield-able with one hand.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I left out grenades and satchel charges, because you could probably actually use them one handed if you’re careful.  The rest I mentioned, nope.  Gordon has next to no experience with firearms.  No way he’s going to be able to pick any of those up and magically be able to use them with one hand without hurting or killing himself.</p>
<p>This idea may fit into other mods, but this mod is a remake of Half-Life.  Changes are being made where they would make sense.  Your suggestion would change the core gameplay too much, so doesn’t make sense.</p>

            <p>I posted a topic a month or so ago saying that hands should disappear in certain situations.</p>
<p>Note: This is should by optional and able to turn on and off in the options section. Also this should not apply to the Online Deathmatch since the gameplay is to faced paced.</p>
<p>I think that your hands should disappear in these situations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pulling a lever.<br>
Climbing a ladder.<br>
Activating something.<br>
Swimming underwater (able to use crossbow).<br>
Using Mortar.<br>
etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I Say that these weapons should not apply to the situations above because<br>
you can use them with one hand making the other hand avalible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crowbar<br>
.357 Magnum<br>
Tau Cannon<br>
MK2 Grenade<br>
Hivehand<br>
Snarks<br>
RPG<br>
Satchel Charge</p>

<p>At any rate, if you want hands to disappear during ladder climbs, OP, I recommend the following strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Black Mesa.</li>
<li>Decompile every map in the game.</li>
<li>Load up Source SDK.</li>
<li>Make a game config using BM’s fgd.</li>
<li>Load up the first map.</li>
<li>Make a point_clientcommand entity somewhere in the level.</li>
<li>Put trigger_multiple boxes on every ladder in the map.</li>
<li>Set each trigger_multiple to have outputs fired OnTouching and OnNotTouching, and have them fire to the point_clientcommand with a “Command” output, with the parameters being “impulse 200.”</li>
<li>Compile and test the map to make sure these work.</li>
<li>Do this for every map in the game.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It would be better to use the OnPlayerGotOnLadder and OnPlayerGotOffLadder outputs of the func_useableladder entity (assuming that’s the entity BM uses).  In any case, OP, yeah, get on that.</p>

            <p>It doesn’t fit because that’s not the point of the mod. I am already disappointed in some of the remolding of the game, with rooms and hallways being greatly changed. Half-Life 1 is killer because of its mix of atmosphere, game play and story line. The more you change structurally, the worse you will get. I was hoping just for a graphics update but I’m cool with some changes. Making the hands disappear in those instances wouldn’t be cool because it would change the already perfect game play of the original.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t even call those customization. It’s upgrades &amp; alternate ammo.</p>

            <p>The only two games in which I enjoyed gun-customization was <span class="bbcode-b">Resident Evil 4</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">Bioshock</span>; I really wouldn’t want to see it Half Life, though.</p>

            <p>You know there was nothing in the game that forced you to customize your gun.</p>
<p>And if anything, it seems like OP is the one who attacked first, since Maxey simply explained how it really doesn’t make sense to which the OP responded</p>

<p>Obviously so keen on defending his ridiculously brilliant idea.</p>
<p>And even if it is a great idea, there’d be no reason to implement something like this because it so radically changes the gameplay, and it would probably require reworking of other mechanics too that it just doesn’t make sense this far in development, whereas in a game like Crysis, they designed the game with those things in mind, not added them in after.</p>

            <p>Personally, I hate the gun customization from Crysis. The differences the different attachments made were really trivial or otherwise poorly balanced. I also don’t see how it could be done using the existing hud menu.</p>

            <p>Why not? the gun modifying would work in any shooter, you just have to be smart enough not to use it during a firefight, and there’s already a nifty hud menu that it could fit into.</p>
