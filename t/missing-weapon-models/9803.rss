    <title>Missing weapon models</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/missing-weapon-models/9803</link>
    <description>I have re-downloaded and re-installed Black Mesa twice, both times I used the checksum before installing. I have used r_drawviewmodels 0/1, with viewmodel_fov -1 to 100, but my weapon models are still missing. I have tried enabling, and disabling all of the options in the Black Mesa tab. I&#39;m using DX9, with recommended graphics settings(everything at max). My game is installed at C:\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS 

At the start of the game when I got the hazmat suit, I did see the hand animations if that counts for anything.

Anyone have any idea what&#39;s wrong?

            <p>Would really like to get this fixed, downloaded from another mirror, didn’t work. Found out if I try to shoot the crossbow, my game crashes.</p>

<p>I’m also having this issue, but it also seems to be keeping me from throwing grenades/satchel charges; when I click to throw, I hear a click sound but nothing happens. If I try to throw a satchel, I still see the detonator, but it doesn’t do anything if I right click except play the animation.</p>

<p>Yep, same thing happens to me too.</p>
