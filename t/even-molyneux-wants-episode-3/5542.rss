            <p>you know, i don’t get why so many people hate on peter molyneux. sure he always promises a lot and does not always deliver on all of it but he’s a very good game designer/ producer and ive loved all the games ive played by him. people like to bitch cause he has high expectations of his own shit or what? i mean he even admitted that he hated how fable 2 played and is working on fixing it(for fable 3). so i ask the black mesa community, why do you think people hate peter molyneux?</p>

<p>What I meant was, how has someone who is ~8 years old, who couldn’t have played any of the series before recently, been waiting for Episode 3?  It kinda pisses me off that this little kid who obviously hasn’t been waiting that long for the next game says “I can only wait a few more years” when myself and many of the people on this forum have been waiting since before this kid even knew what Half-Life was.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I played a few series and knew what I liked and wanted another and disliked and didn’t want before I was 8. And plus I am sure he obviously knows a lot for his age seeing who his dad is. And when I was that age I was way more anxious for things than I am now…I don’t know what he meant about the few more years thing though</p>
<p>And ughh I want Black and White 3 not another Fable.</p>

            <p>Yeah, my dad bought the original WON HL1 when I was 6 (I didn’t have my own PC then) and <span class="bbcode-b">I</span> installed it, set it up and played it first. My dad was rather amazed.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I was SEVEN when Half-Life first came out and I was really into it, so you can’t say much about that. Infact my 3 year old cousin plays CSS! He reaches up on his own and actually plays, he even knows the quick Q weapon switch… its amazing, I dont think it can get any younger than that.</p>

<p>Peter’s kid came off as a bit of a moron IMO.  Though it looks like he was ambushed.</p>
<p>How can an 8 year old (just a guess) be so into a series like Half-Life?  And how does he get off saying he’s been waiting a long time to play the next game, and he’s willing to wait a couple more years?</p>
<p>Peter should have just made the video himself and cut his kid out of the equation completely.</p>

<p>You have to take into account that a couple of years can be about half his lifespan so far. Children’s sense of time is a bit different.</p>

            <p>You shouldn’t be pissed off by this… let him say what he wants, he’s just a kid, and he probably legitimately does want EP3.</p>
<p>I don’t see what’s so rageworthy here guys…</p>

<p>What I meant was, how has someone who is ~8 years old, who couldn’t have played any of the series before recently, been waiting for Episode 3?  It kinda pisses me off that this little kid who obviously hasn’t been waiting that long for the next game says “I can only wait a few more years” when myself and many of the people on this forum have been waiting since before this kid even knew what Half-Life was.</p>

<p>How can an 8 year old (just a guess) be so into a series like Half-Life?  And how does he get off saying he’s been waiting a long time to play the next game, and he’s willing to wait a couple more years?</p>
