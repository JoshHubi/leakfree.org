    <description>In the beginning of the game, right after getting your suit and going down the elevator. bm_c1a0b at -1325.900024 1924.118652 -160.468750;setang 5.601017 -90.367661 0.000000

When the elevator is going down, if you jump off the edge and reach the door before the lift, the game will never load the next area and will leave you stuck outside the door only being able to explore up and down the ladder.


This highly confused me as to what to do, until I killed myself and rode the elevator the whole way down and realized it was a loading point.  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>
