    <title>Help with underclocking 670 FTW</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-with-underclocking-670-ftw/12448</link>
    <description>So apparently GPU overclocks could be causing the issues I&#39;m having with Metro LL and I want to try and revert the factory overclock I have on my card with a separate PrecisionX profile to see if it helps. I have no idea what I&#39;m doing though. Looking the card up gives me a bunch of clock rates but I have no idea how to go about changing values in PrecisionX to underclock it. If someone could help me with this I would appreciate it a lot.</description>
