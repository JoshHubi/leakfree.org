    <title>Bug report option</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bug-report-option/13836</link>
    <description>I was playing the steam version of BM yesterday and had a problem jumping on the hanging containers somewhere in the binging of the game...
Anyway.. since the game is not done and probably allot of bugs are yet to be found it might be a good idea to make a bug report option in the menu which saves where you are, where you look at and a place you can fill in a description?
That way everyone can be a play-tester.</description>
