    <description>[align=center][b]Cinematic Mod Re-Thoughted[/b][/size]
(Sorry for bad English not my native language) [img]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wcf/images/smilies/unsure.png[/img][/size][/align] [b]Summary[/b] : After I heard what people are saying things about cinematic mod, and yes I know it has horrible models, but personaly i think there is still hope for this mod and I alone gather models, textures, effects for this mod not to mention I&#39;m also remaking the whole music and change some of the scripts
(not to mention I have worked almost two years) to change the view of people about this mod. Still there is a lot of work to do and remember I&#39;m working all by miself to make this mod a real reinterpretation of Half-Life 2. And from what I done by now I&#39;m about 25%  to 30% done still there many things left to do. Wish me luck. [img]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wcf/images/smilies/biggrin.png[/img]

[b]By the way any sugestions will be noticed and replyed[/b]  :thumbup: [/size]

Ok guys here are some of my music please enjoy and please take note that this is kind of hard to make and there will be in parts as I progress:
-(Also there will be gameplay footage after I&#39;ve finished to create and place the soundtrack for specific  chapters  of the games)-
-(And yes there will be pics Dotard, but after I&#39;ve dealt with some scripting problems I&#39;ve encounterd)
[youtube.com/watch?v=ILaDyJtQ0Cw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILaDyJtQ0Cw)
[b] Song List[/b]:

00:00 song used for suit
01:06 song maybe used for airboat
05:05 song maybe used for nova prospekt ambush
08:02 I haven&#39;t decided to what chapter to use this song (any sugestions)
10:53 I haven&#39;t decided to what chapter to use this song (any sugestions)

Ok, here&#39;s  a summary of the things I will be  doing:

-(1) A [b]Half-Life 2 CM 13 Pack[/b] ([u]which consists of models, textures and effects done by the community, and a complete new soundtrack done by me, not to mention some scripting too[/u])

-(2) A [b]Half-Life 2 Episode One CM 13 Pack[/b] ([u]it&#39;s basically like the HL2CM13 Pack but with the requierd modifications for Episode One[/u])

-(3) And a [b]Half-Life 2 Episode Two CM 13 Pack[/b] ([u]it&#39;s basically like the HL2CM13 Pack but with the requierd modifications for Episode Two [/u])

[align=center]Update: Hello everyone, I have some news. First of all this project has to take a break for now because I have to take some exams, second of all I have some harware problems (I have to reinstall Windows and get a new power supply). The good news are that I can continue my work, and maybe next month I&#39;ll release a teaser trailer for the mod.[/align]


[align=center]Thanks for understaning and support.  :thumbup:[/align]</description>

<p>Oh sorry, i thought it is one song.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
I listen to first 3 minutes or so before my internet froze.<br>
I listened the rest of them know, the first 3 are calm and intriguing.<br>
While the last two are what i was looking for, a song for action.<br>
They would definitely fit while shooting the combine.<br>

<p>Well actually the first song will be used for the H.E.V suit while the other’s I havent decided yet and may need some retouch, but still I’m glad you like them  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  and Thank you for the support.</p>

<p>First of all, a pack may come out soon but i’m still trying to figure out how to deal with the scripts. Second of all I have about 103 song (just for HL2) to remake and I’ve olny done 30 not to mention there also the stingers, stil the pack is just for testing purpose and dosen’t  contain any music for now. (I forgot to mention this mod is For CM 13). And yes after I’ve finished to retouch some music I will post  an other video. Thank you for the support. :thumbup:</p>

<p>Wait so are you remaking models or using those from gamebanana instead? Cause 2 of your posts contradict. Also I think the soundtrack came out nice, sounds like something that would fit CM, but some parts of the songs get a bit repetitive. Good luck anyways.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>First of all the soundtrack is still a work in progress and those are  just some  samples I’ve chose from what I did. Second of all the some of the models  are from gamebanana while some are mine not to mention  I’m mostly editing textures and scripts because working with music is kind of hard ( it takes me 3 to 4 days to make a song and mostly is just editing).</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m glad you like them but what song are you talking about so I can make the changes to it, because there are about 5 in this video mostly a work in progress, except the first one (please specife the minutes ).</p>

<p>Someone that only tries to  re-mod it just because I like what the devs did with the enviroment, and not the models or copyrighted soundtrack from the batman movies… stil most of my work is on the soundtrack, but the models are from half life 2 comunity (ex: gamebanana,moddb and valves original models ).</p>

            <p>Yes, I do have some music  if you want.

            <p>Surely you mean Re-thought as Re-Thoughted isn’t even a word.</p>

            <p>Not interested until you post your pics. Would hope after two years of work you’d have something to show for it.</p>

            <p>[align=center]<span class="bbcode-b">Cinematic Mod Re-Thoughted</span>[/size]<br>
(Sorry for bad English not my native language) <img src="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wcf/images/smilies/unsure.png" alt="" width="" height="">[/size][/align] <span class="bbcode-b">Summary</span> : After I heard what people are saying things about cinematic mod, and yes I know it has horrible models, but personaly i think there is still hope for this mod and I alone gather models, textures, effects for this mod not to mention I’m also remaking the whole music and change some of the scripts<br>
(not to mention I have worked almost two years) to change the view of people about this mod. Still there is a lot of work to do and remember I’m working all by miself to make this mod a real reinterpretation of Half-Life 2. And from what I done by now I’m about 25%  to 30% done still there many things left to do. Wish me luck. <img src="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wcf/images/smilies/biggrin.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">By the way any sugestions will be noticed and replyed</span>  :thumbup: [/size]</p>
<p>Ok guys here are some of my music please enjoy and please take note that this is kind of hard to make and there will be in parts as I progress:<br>
-(Also there will be gameplay footage after I’ve finished to create and place the soundtrack for specific  chapters  of the games)-<br>
-(And yes there will be pics Dotard, but after I’ve dealt with some scripting problems I’ve encounterd)<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILaDyJtQ0Cw" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=ILaDyJtQ0Cw</a><br>
<span class="bbcode-b"> Song List</span>:</p>
<p>00:00 song used for suit<br>
01:06 song maybe used for airboat<br>
05:05 song maybe used for nova prospekt ambush<br>
08:02 I haven’t decided to what chapter to use this song (any sugestions)<br>
10:53 I haven’t decided to what chapter to use this song (any sugestions)</p>
<p>Ok, here’s  a summary of the things I will be  doing:</p>
<p>-(1) A <span class="bbcode-b">Half-Life 2 CM 13 Pack</span> (<span class="bbcode-u">which consists of models, textures and effects done by the community, and a complete new soundtrack done by me, not to mention some scripting too</span>)</p>
<p>-(2) A <span class="bbcode-b">Half-Life 2 Episode One CM 13 Pack</span> (<span class="bbcode-u">it’s basically like the HL2CM13 Pack but with the requierd modifications for Episode One</span>)</p>
<p>-(3) And a <span class="bbcode-b">Half-Life 2 Episode Two CM 13 Pack</span> (<span class="bbcode-u">it’s basically like the HL2CM13 Pack but with the requierd modifications for Episode Two </span>)</p>
<p>[align=center]Update: Hello everyone, I have some news. First of all this project has to take a break for now because I have to take some exams, second of all I have some harware problems (I have to reinstall Windows and get a new power supply). The good news are that I can continue my work, and maybe next month I’ll release a teaser trailer for the mod.[/align]</p>
<p>[align=center]Thanks for understaning and support.  :thumbup:[/align]</p>
