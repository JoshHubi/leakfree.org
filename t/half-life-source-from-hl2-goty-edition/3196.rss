    <title>Half Life: Source from HL2: GotY Edition</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-source-from-hl2-goty-edition/3196</link>
    <description>Hello, Forumites!  I debated placing this one in &quot;Half-Life Series&quot; but since this is a question about help or support, I placed it here.

I came across an old copy of Half Life 2...  It&#39;s the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; edition.  It says that it has Counterstrike Source, HL2: Deathmatch, and HL: Source as well as HL2.

My question:  I can&#39;t find how to install Half-Life: Source from the three discs that were in the case.  The only option I can find on all three discs is &quot;Install Half-Life 2&quot;.  I already have the Steam version of HL2 and I&#39;m dubious about installing that over the Steam version (I guess I could install it somewhere else) simply to get to HL: Source.

I don&#39;t want this to turn into a discussion about the pros and cons of HL: Source or your feelings on it.  I just want to know how to install it using the GotY edition.  Do I really have to install HL2: GotY to get at HL: Source?

Thanks!</description>

            <p>That’s kind of what I was afraid of.  I’ve asked Valve for a new key before on another game but they said that it would cost $10.  If that’s the case, then I might as well just buy it off Steam and be done with it.</p>
<p>Ah well.  It was a nice thought…</p>

            <p>Then i don’t think anyone can really help ya.<br>
Installing via disc’s will require a cd key, as will trying to register it with steam.</p>
<p>So basically your game of the year addition is worthless. :’(</p>
