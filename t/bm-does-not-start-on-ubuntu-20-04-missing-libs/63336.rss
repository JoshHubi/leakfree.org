    <title>BM does not start on Ubuntu 20.04 - missing libs</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bm-does-not-start-on-ubuntu-20-04-missing-libs/63336</link>
    <description>After upgrading to Kubuntu to 20.04 and BM to latest stable version as of now (unfortunately I upgraded both at the same time) BM does not start from Steam UI at all, and from bm.sh reports missing libraries. After manually installing some libraries, game progressed to main menu but still crashed on loading &quot;new game&quot;.
BM is supposed to contain all libraries it needs, (since it is 32 bit, and mostly run on 64 bin Linux) and so far mostly did (except old problems with libstdc++.so.6)
Following libs are missing:

libopenal1
libsndio7.0
libasound2
libtier0.so
libfontconfig.so.1
libfreetype.so.6
... and many more. Root supplied libraries with missing dependencies seem to be engine.so and vguimatsurface.so


CC, kindly fix it as a critical issue as that looks like is affecting everyone on Ubuntu 20.04 (these libs do not come preinstalled in 32 bit versions anymore?)

I keep losing patience downloading these libs manually, which seems to be your job, right?</description>
