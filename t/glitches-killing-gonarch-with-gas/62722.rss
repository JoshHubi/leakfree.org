    <title>Glitches killing Gonarch with gas</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glitches-killing-gonarch-with-gas/62722</link>
    <description>Trying to beat Gonarch with gas brought through Xen and teleported earlier in the level. After taking the left turn into the tunnel up to where the gas is activated for the final fight, sometimes the gonarch will stop at the entrance and fail to complete its animation and the game can&#39;t proceed. Sometimes it does complete its animation and seal the entrance to the tunnel, but then after activating the gas and killing it, I still won&#39;t be able to jump off the ledge from where that was done, invisible wall is still there.
