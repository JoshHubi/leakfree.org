    <title>Crash in the Half-Life 2 Awakening mod and the Portal 2 comic.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-in-the-half-life-2-awakening-mod-and-the-portal-2-comic/8017</link>
    <description>On page fourteen of the LAB RAT comic, on the table, next to the portal gun is a Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator/Gravity Gun. On the wall there is a health charger and a HEV charger. This, the gravity gun, proves that Black Mesa have been stealing things from Aperture. And that makes Half-Life 2 Awakening completley useless, since Mossman tell Shephard that they have a prototype of their latest research, the Gravity Gun. Also, in the down-left corner, there is a combine health panel, which proves that the combine found the Borealis and used some of its technology.

Also, on page 9 you see Chell&#39;s file. There is a lot of ones and zeroes, which can be transalated in to The Cake Is A Lie. Which makes three present Cake references in Portal 2: The above, the scrolling text on the monitors that can be transalated in to the cake recepie and of course, the GLaDOS Emergency Shutdown and Cake Dispensery door.</description>

            <p>It’s possible that the scanners simply transmit a map of the area with an icon for whomever it’s scanning and not an actual video/picture of what’s going on (unless it actually takes a photo) so Breen wouldn’t see what he was carrying.  Further, Breen didn’t really care too much at that moment because he had just captured Alyx and Eli and he relied on the soldiers to either capture or kill Gordon.</p>

            <p>I meant, we know he was watching Gordon inside The Citadel, and may or may not have been keeping tabs on him before he went inside.  Personally, I killed all scanners I came across, because of the chance of armor, but that doesn’t mean there weren’t scanners further off that were watching.</p>

            <p>Breen would no doubt have been, at the very least, watching Gordon’s progress through The Citadel.  Black Mesa invention or not, he knew what the gravity gun was capable of.  He would have shrugged it off the way he did because he’s a cocky bastard and was convinced he had won.</p>

            <p>Since when have comics been cannon anyway?<br>
I’ve seen so many comics which have contradicted the established cannon that I have learnt not to pay too much attention.  I think you should do the same. (I’m not speaking specifically about HL)</p>
<p>If it’s in the game then it’s cannon.<br>
If Gabe Newell tells me it’s cannon then it’s cannon.<br>
Otherwise, it’s not cannon.</p>

            <p>Gordon had no idéa what it was, but he could use it easyily. How hard is it to find a primary trigger? Breen probably thought that it was some sort of weapon and simply pressed the primary trigger, thinking that it could kill Gordon. And he didn’t even pause to investegate the Gravitygun, he said it with a laughing voice, like:<br>
“Was it nessecary to take that useless thing from him? Put it over there.”<br>

<p>So, if Black Mesa created the Gravitygun, why didn’t Breen know what it was up in the citadel when the Combine Elite showed it to him?<br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Easy explanation.</p>
<p>When they brought him the Gravity gun, he didn’t recognize it right away, because it was blue and glowing - “Oh, what’s this?”<br>
Then he looked more carefully and realized it’s just a Gravity gun. (a tool designed for handling hazardous materials). He didn’t know it was supercharged so he didn’t consider it a threat. - “Meh, put it over there.”</p>
<p>Easy right?</p>
<p>Also, when Judith betrayed him, he picked it up and used it to stop Gordon, which means he must have known how to use it from earlier.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I think we can all agree with Breen being the administrator of Black Mesa, right? So, as the administrator, he should be aware of all experiments that Black Mesa does, and all of Black Mesa’s devices. Right?<br>
So, if Black Mesa created the Gravitygun, why didn’t Breen know what it was up in the citadel when the Combine Elite showed it to him?<br>
“Oh, what’s this? Put it over there.”</p>
<p>And I can accept that the HL2 gravitygun was built by combine technology, because if Aperture builded it, then Black Mesa might have stolen the blueprints of the gravitygun, but never finished it, maybe they got hold of the blueprints right before the Black Mesa incident, Kleiner or Eli brought them out of BM and later made another one out of combine tech based on Aperture’s blueprints. I don’t think that Breen would have any intrest of blueprints anyways.<br>
About the test chambers; I can bet that we didn’t see everything of the old Aperture’s test chambers anyways, you saw more of them in multiplayer then you saw in singleplayer. There might have been more of them. And maybe they had some small chambers on the Borealis for gravitygun testing.</p>
<p>This brings me to another theory: The combine finds blueprints of the gravitygun, Alyx, Eli or Kleiner manages to steal the blueprints from the combine.</p>
<p>Kleiner having blueprints just like these in his lab just makes my theory stronger.</p>

<p>If this were the case, there would be no reason to not use the crowbar in close range.  Just because he has a full body exoskeleton doesn’t mean it makes him stronger.  I could see it being able to support it’s own weight, but not any more, for power efficiency’s sake.  That suit does a lot, so it doesn’t need to enhance Gordon’s strength.</p>

<p>This is taken from the CombineOverWiki: “The HEV Suit,[1], or Hazardous Environment suit, often called the “hazard suit” for sake of convenience, is a full-body hazardous materials suit developed at the Black Mesa Research Facility, designed for Black Mesa scientists to protect them from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt-force trauma during the handling of hazardous materials and to protect them from the effects of traveling to Xen as part of Survey Teams.”</p>
<p>The HEV suit does not make Gordon stronger. You must be confusing the Nanosuit from Crysis with the HEV suit from Half Life.</p>

            <p>But when you see anyone else use the gravitygun, they struggle like hell, and with the HEV suit it seems light as a feather. So my theory is that Aperture had HEV suits, doesn’t matter who made them, and used them for the gravitygun testing.</p>
<p>Sure, your theories of Aperture stealing from Black Mesa is also an option, that they stole the Gravitygun that BM didn’t have to upgrade their portalgun.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Seriously man, those are pretty far-fetched theories. Also, you don’t need an HEV suit to use the gravity gun. Remember the ending of Half-Life 2 and the beginning of Episode 2? There is no apparent reason, for the HEV suit chargers, to be in the Aperture Laboratories.</p>

It seems pretty round, white and shiny to me. Also, it’s a cube, so it can’t be completely round.</p>
<p>Maybe. But, as I said before, why haven’t they ever used it in the testing? It is a device that can pick and throw stuff at long distances. I’d say it has quite big potential for further testing.</p>

            <p>As I said before, the Gravity Gun never showed itself at black mesa either. And are the cubes white and shiny? Do they have round and smooth edges?</p>
<p>The portalgun that you use in portal and portal 2 is the later verision, this is the first one: <a href="https://www.google.se/imgres?q=early+portalgun&amp;hl=sv&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=596&amp;gbv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=KXkUSOkMME7lcM:&amp;imgrefurl=https://plus.google.com/106644679955512109359/posts/Jz4xd942x2p&amp;docid=8cYSjRxE_5YBmM&amp;imgurl=https://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/2011-04-22_00008.jpg&amp;w=1680&amp;h=1050&amp;ei=zg-5TtuAN6fU4QTa39iACA&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=371&amp;vpy=186&amp;dur=1326&amp;hovh=177&amp;hovw=284&amp;tx=197&amp;ty=82&amp;sig=110328232822049236094&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=101&amp;tbnw=161&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=16&amp;ved=1t:429,r:2,s:0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.google.se/imgres?q=early+portalgun&amp;hl=sv&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=596&amp;gbv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=KXkUSOkMME7lcM:&amp;imgrefurl=https://plus.google.com/106644679955512109359/posts/Jz4xd942x2p&amp;docid=8cYSjRxE_5YBmM&amp;imgurl=https://server.ericsbinaryworld.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/2011-04-22_00008.jpg&amp;w=1680&amp;h=1050&amp;ei=zg-5TtuAN6fU4QTa39iACA&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=371&amp;vpy=186&amp;dur=1326&amp;hovh=177&amp;hovw=284&amp;tx=197&amp;ty=82&amp;sig=110328232822049236094&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=101&amp;tbnw=161&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=16&amp;ved=1t:429,r:2,s:0</a></p>
<p>Does that seem edgy or round to you?</p>
<p>The Gravity gun being on the table might mean that they brought an early invention up into the new aperture to combine the quantum tunneling device with the gravity gun, to make the finished portalgun.</p>
<p>EDIT: The Gravitygun looks as old as the other devices from the old aperture, so they might just have created it before they builded the new Aperture.</p>

<p>EDIT: I could still point out that the gravity gun showed itself in Aperture before the Half-Life 2 time, which means Aperture had it first.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As somebody already pointed out, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the gravity is their invention. They could just steal it from Black Mesa and adapt that concept for the portal gun.</p>
<p>Also it seems like Aperture is really concerned about the design of their inventions. Everything has smooth edges and white shiny surface. Now check the design of the gravity gun on the table and the first aid and the HEV charger on the wall. (<a href="https://media.comics.ign.com/media/105/105745/img_8359703.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://media.comics.ign.com/media/105/105745/img_8359703.html</a>) It doesn’t really look like something the Aperture would made. It seems more like they are just trying to recreate it in their own way. That’s probably why Black Mesa is covered with all those chargers, while in Aperture Laboratories you don’t see it at all.</p>
<p>Also, if the Aperture had the gravity gun first. Why wouldn’t they use it in the testing, like they did with every of their other inventions? Why wouldn’t they use it’s full potential?</p>
