    <title>Why not Female HEV deathmatch model?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-not-female-hev-deathmatch-model/14172</link>
    <description>Hello.
My name is Luigi Rapetta and I am an italian fan of Half-Life and its remake. I would like to share with you a little suggestion for the DeathMatch.
I know several girls that love FPS games, like Halo or Half-Life itself. These my friends prefer to play those games with their SCI-FI armored alter-ego. They love the super soldiers of Halo, the Spartans, and mostly their armors. Now, I noted that in Black Mesa there is just a multiplayer model for the HEV suit, which is male. Because they are girls, they have been forced to play with the female scientist model. Obviously they prefered the HEV. Because of this, they have chosen to select the male HEV model, but they are not totally satisfied. It could be a nice idea to put a female HEV model in the game for the deathmatch. In the original Half-Life there was the Gina&#39;s model for the multiplayer, just to take an example.
Thanks for reading and I hope you approve this opinion.   :slight_smile:</description>

<p>I highly doubt that obese and noticably shorter scientists are using HEV suits. I always figured HEV scientists are mostly athletic:</p>

            <p>I have nothing against adding playermodels, but cant we just drop this social justice attitude where “female players now cant identify themselves with the game character”.<br>
Next thing is we need a black man in a HEV suit playermodel, isnt it?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While I agree on the “breastplated” part, I completely disagree on how it should look exactly same part. I don’t think HEV suit is a one size fits all type of thing. What if the scientist wearing it is shorter, taller, thinner or fatter? It is a protective suit, I think it would be custom ordered for the people that needs to wear one. (after all, you don’t pick scientists depending on the body type, thats just unrealistic and if you can’t fit the protective suit you are wearing, it is useless to you) Female version could be slightly different, just a bit slender and shorter.</p>

<p>Thank you =)</p>
<p>[edit:] <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/57734-rapfamily4/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@rapfamily4</a> I get what you’re trying to say - yet “girls play too” is a statement, not an argument. Kids (or well, teens) play the game too, yet you won’t see me ask to insert underaged characters in as playable characters. In fact, I would have adviced against female characters, had there not been female researchers at Black Mesa.</p>
<p>Basically, my point is: if you want true equality, you need to insert a very advanced character editor, rather than just set options, as otherwise there’s always a group that plays the game you’re not representing (skin color in particular). But let’s not get all Smooth Jazz Waluigi in here, I don’t want to ruin the mood. Considering female variants for the HEV suit is good enough for me for now - if the devs want to take it a step further, that’s up to them. [/edit]</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree with Crypt here, the BM version of the HEV suit -to me- doesn’t look like it’d be very comfortable for women with anything over a B cup. Mind you, I’m not saying women with B cup or less don’t count (I think my girlfriend would be very angry at me), but there’s a reason there’s not only different sizes but also different cuts in clothing between men and women. I can imagine something similar happening with the HEV suits.<br>
I’m not an expert model or animation artist, so I do not know how much effort it would take. And it feels kinda wrong to submit requests for something I haven’t even bought (yet!). But if possible, and if it’s not too much trouble, I’d love to see a slightly altered female HEV suit as well.</p>
<div class="sepquote">
<span class="smallfont">Edit:</span>
<br>
<br>
<p> P.S. I think “girls play games too” is indeed a horrible argument. “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/3/5/8153213/the-games-industry-is-wrong-about-kids-gaming-and-gender" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Your game would be more attractive to girls</a> and could improve sales if you cater to them more” is not, and is in my opinion a valid argument, although not the primary reason I support this idea. </p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I approve the idea to insert the parity of genders in videogames, and I consider “girls play too” a valid argument, but not from the point of view of the business, instead from the point of view of the social benefits. If I didn’t explain me well, try to remember the very old multiplayer games, where the customization of the player sets a male character as a unchangeable default. If you were a girl or a woman that wants to play as a female character, don’t you feel excluded? I don’t want to seem a moralist, but I want to explain this argument from the view of a <span class="bbcode-u">girl</span> that wants to play <span class="bbcode-u">as a girl</span>. In fact, not all the women wants to play as a female character, and not all men wants to play as a male character (the article that you posted is the evidence). If the minds of the developers of any videogame were more open to the diversity, they could find solutions to satisfy every person: males that plays as males, females that plays as females, males that plays as females and females that plays as males…</p>

<p>In fact I meant to put an HEV with female voice acting or change some anatomy parts in a minor way. I know that the HEV suit is unisex and I like it mostly for this.

</aside>
<p>In fact the HEV is unisex! It could be nice add a female voice acting to an other model that is wearing the (unisex) HEV suit. I just meant this at the beginning of the discussion, sorry for the misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I think there’s a noticeable difference in physique. Obviously you don’t want to make it look exaggeratedly feminine (the HEV suit often has that covered anyway), just modified proportions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with Crypt here, the BM version of the HEV suit -to me- doesn’t look like it’d be very comfortable for women with anything over a B cup. Mind you, I’m not saying women with B cup or less don’t count (I think my girlfriend would be very angry at me), but there’s a reason there’s not only different sizes but also different cuts in clothing between men and women. I can imagine something similar happening with the HEV suits.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert model or animation artist, so I do not know how much effort it would take. And it feels kinda wrong to submit requests for something I haven’t even bought (yet!). But if possible, and if it’s not too much trouble, I’d love to see a slightly altered female HEV suit as well.</p>

<p> P.S. I think “girls play games too” is indeed a horrible argument. “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/3/5/8153213/the-games-industry-is-wrong-about-kids-gaming-and-gender" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Your game would be more attractive to girls</a> and could improve sales if you cater to them more” is not, and is in my opinion a valid argument, although not the primary reason I support this idea. </p>

            <p>Last time I checked there is a distinct lack of female characters you can choose from.<br>
In conclusion this thread suggestion would be good for that reason amongst other reasons.</p>

</aside>
<p>Depends if you take that reason as stereo typical then yes it would be stupid.<br>
But its not males tend to take male character more likely to replace themselves in.<br>
Choosing one that either looks more like himself or choosing one that they like to be in their fantasies.<br>
The same goes for females.</p>
<p>Any game developer knows characterizing is part of the game.</p>

            <p>The original HEV design was actually looked pretty feminine in physique IMO. Nothing wrong with that, I just think it explains it.</p>

            <p>I would posit that the HEV suit is unisex so the model wouldn’t have to change.  But there is voice acting and it’s the male scientists’ voices.  Whomever does the voice acting for the female scientists could possibly provide the voice acting for female HEV’d scientists.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yeah, I think the HEV suit would look the roughly the same between genders.  Just put the female scientist heads on it? X)</p>

            <p>Well, personally I always envisioned that female HEV suits would be the same as the dudes’ ones. I never liked the “breastplated” or more slender look that a lot of games go for female characters, just doesn’t feel right to me for a suit of armour.</p>

            <p>Hello.<br>
My name is Luigi Rapetta and I am an italian fan of Half-Life and its remake. I would like to share with you a little suggestion for the DeathMatch.<br>
I know several girls that love FPS games, like Halo or Half-Life itself. These my friends prefer to play those games with their SCI-FI armored alter-ego. They love the super soldiers of Halo, the Spartans, and mostly their armors. Now, I noted that in Black Mesa there is just a multiplayer model for the HEV suit, which is male. Because they are girls, they have been forced to play with the female scientist model. Obviously they prefered the HEV. Because of this, they have chosen to select the male HEV model, but they are not totally satisfied. It could be a nice idea to put a female HEV model in the game for the deathmatch. In the original Half-Life there was the Gina’s model for the multiplayer, just to take an example.<br>
Thanks for reading and I hope you approve this opinion.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
