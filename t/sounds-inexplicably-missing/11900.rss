    <title>Sounds inexplicably missing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sounds-inexplicably-missing/11900</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just had a resurgence of a problem I&#39;ve had once before where, when playing games, only some of the sounds will actually play. Other sounds, oftentimes voices for some reason, are distorted or outright missing.

The last time this happened, the sounds only seemed to play from some angles; for instance, I could hear an NPC when they were next to me, but not when I was looking straight at them. I eventually managed to fix it by reinstalling my audio drivers (or, more specifically, uninstalling it and letting windows install a new one when it started troubleshooting. I think I was following instructions from somewhere), after which, I could get my headphones to work, but only when plugged into the rear jack, which is designated as being for speakers, not headphones.

It&#39;s just now started happening again while my little brother was playing CS:GO, which he just bought. He says that it crashed, and he shut it down via the task manager, at which point the problem mentioned above, or at least something very similar to it, started happening again. I&#39;ve tried the same stuff I did last time, but to no avail.

Does anyone have any idea what the problem is and/or how to solve it? Any help would be much appreciated.</description>

            <p>That’s not too bad, I used to use 2 mice since one of them had a broken right click and the left click worked, and the other mouse was the other way around.</p>

            <p>Just because I have a way around the problem doesn’t mean it’s solved. As it is, I no longer have a working mic, unless I wear two headsets at once.</p>
