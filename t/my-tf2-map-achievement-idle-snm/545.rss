    <title>My TF2 Map, Achievement_idle_snm</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-tf2-map-achievement-idle-snm/545</link>
    <description>[align=left][/align]Well, I made a TF2 map for a server to replace its stupid, generic achievement_idle map. It&#39;s called achievement_idle_snm (working title, it&#39;s going through an identity crisis and may be changed to a_i_arena, or a_i_orange) it&#39;s a basic TF2 idle map, but with fixes to each of the annoying things from it&#39;s predecessor. It&#39;s not in it&#39;s final yet, but the reason I&#39;m showing the BMS community this, is that I [u][b]need[/b][/u] testing done on it. I can only test it with one person on the map, and everyone I send it to says the same basic response, but I need critique, and I&#39;m entrusting you guys to give it to me by testing and replying here. Of course.

(Oh, and if you&#39;d like to post screenshots on what you find that is wrong and I should change, or that is good and needs to stay the same, it&#39;d be much easier than guessing what you&#39;re talking about.)

Thanks for the help, SNM.</description>

<p>^ All of that. And the last sentence I apply to idle maps as well now. That server could have people on it genuinely playing the game and having real fun, which was always the way I earned all my weapons anyway.</p>

<p>Then why even call it an idle map</p>

</aside>
<p>Although it’s geared toward fun while not idling, it’s still in it’s spirit, an idle map.</p>
<p>You can never capture the point, and sitting in spawn causes constant damage. As I said it’s meant to replace the generic Achievement_Idle map on a server that’s ran by some friends and I felt the Idle map they go to every night wasn’t fun to moderate/play, so I made a version I felt could house actually gameplay. maybe.</p>
<p>(it actually needs a lot of moderation, because there are people who trade achievements and the griefers that attack them, flamers, etc, etc.)</p>

</aside>
<p>To be honest, I do agree with you on the fact that achievement servers have ruined TF2, but VALVe didn’t help by making the only way to get powerful new weapons achievement based. So they made random, time-based unlocks, creating a_idle maps. But the point of idle maps having no gameplay is kind of wrong, when I first tried to get the Dead Ringer I used an Idle server, and it was a constant feud of RvB Idlers trying to claim the CP room (since the CP never really unlocks) before going idle again, so I thought I should make an arena styled map to allow a more pleasurable experience while not idling but remaining on the server.</p>
<p>Just think of it as a normal Arena/CP map, it actually is more geared toward that than just idling.</p>
