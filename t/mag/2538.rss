    <description>Anyone looking forward to this game? I just played the beta and even tho u can only play with up to 64 people, I have to say that things got pretty intense, I can&#39;t even imagine what its gonna be like with 256 people. Anyone who doesn&#39;t know, MAG stands for Massive Action Game. Its a PS3 exclusive coming out on the 26th and its a multiplayer FPS that boasts up to 256 people battles. Featuring huge maps, vehicles, huge selection of weapons, intense visuals, chain of command (squad leader all the way up to officer in command), robust leveling system, unlockables, extensive weapon upgrade system, and much more this game looks like it will take multiplayer FPS to whole new scale.</description>

<p>It’s pretty noticable. When I was attempting to get the Annual acheivment (4players finish the last level in Ghosts on Legendary with Iron Skull), someone would always veer off the edge of the cliff because the autoaim would steer your vehicle into enemy infantry.</p>

<p>If you get behind someone and start running after them, you don’t even have to move the joystick to keep your view on them.

<p>Pfch, default. I use green thumb, it’s for real men. Melee is tied to pressing the right stick down. Makes it a lot easier to aim and punch at the same time.</p>

            <p>I want this game to do well, but I was dissapointed in the trailers and demos I’ve seen of it. In a game with 256 players, gameplay should be realistic, but what I’ve seen seems very arcadey and run-and gun. Also, this one of the only games I’ve seen where the models and animations are so horrible that I might not play it.</p>

            <p>The only ps3 game i’ve ever wanted a pc port for. I mean it seems big at first and all but the way the showed even just the map shows, that although the map has 256 players you will only experience 30-60 of those at any given time.  But thats probably a good thing it’d probably get sorta spammy.  I also have a feeling map design is going to be very important for this game,  and some maps will be played a ton and others left to die a horrible death  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> .</p>

<p>EDIT: This just occurred to me. If you are going to make a game whose only distinguishing feature is that it supports a lot of people, then why would the demo support a lot less people? I feel like they are hiding bad gameplay when lots of people join.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>One thats not its only distinguishing feature it has loads more ive played the beta and it is fun, really fun, hard to play at first because its big and confusing but you relise it actually isnt. And Btw they have tested it with 256 players and it works fine, i didnt experience any lag and was very smooth. The maps are huge so its not just a spawn and die game. The rank system which enables commands and objective to be set for a platoon or squad is awsome too. In the beta it wasnt used much but that was only because it was beta and to give orders you need a high rank but the game wasnt playing for long so not many people could achieve that rank. I played COD6 and the BC 2 Beta and even though they are awsome games theres something about MAG that makes it enjoyable, i was sad when the beta ended  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> . i am so gonna get this game.<br>
And who says that there wont be enough players?? lol theres were too many people wanting to play the beta and actually theres are WAY more people with a ps3 now almost everyone i know thats a gamer owns a ps3 so thats not a prob. and woo this game experience and spec system is cool, and whoop vehicles too.<br>
i think this game is very realistic with its gameplay and graphics considoring the players it holds. I’ve only played one type of mode on the beta because i joined late but that was awsome and some of the other features look awsome too.</p>
<p>However i dont think all people will like this game, if you just like going off on your own and getting kills then sure you can do that but defies the point of the game to use teamwork which also means that everyone that plays this game should probably have a headset if they want to have a say in the orders  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  but you can still play it and ahve fun that way, i did  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> . When your together as a team and a bunch of guys have your cornered its awsome when one of your guys goes down and with give the medic covering fire while he revives and give him first aid and getting him back to your squad  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p>Anyway personally for me its pure epicness!</p>
<p>PS. COD and BC2 are awsome too no doubt about it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>that rarely happens though, but when it happens it is blatant and highly annoying.</p>
<p>CoDMW2 has disorientations from that at times (some enemy runs past you and you hit the knife, doing a 270 spin because of lock on).</p>

<p>The PC is without a doubt the best interface for FPS/TPS/RTS games, but I find the controller to work just fine. It depends on how well the developers make use of sensitivity options. Plus, there’s a “weak auto-aim” feature <span class="bbcode-i">(ie, not like GTA’s auto aim)</span> that makes aiming slightly easier.<br>
Halo 3, for example, pretty much has perfect aiming controls, and I’d say I’m pretty good at that game when I get into it.</p>

<p>i dont see what uncharted was all about, its a poorly developed TRU with a combat system that makes link’s awakening’s version on the gameboy respectable.</p>

<p>halo 3’s auto-aim was ridiculous, modern warfare 2 has some but not loads. can sometimes be annoying, when it comes to multiplayer all aim assists should be removed, but still its not unfair play if everyone has it. :retard:</p>

<p>I’m not a PS3 fanboy, but even I know that’s not true. Off the top of my head, Killzone was pretty big, as was the wonderful Little Big Planet. Don’t forget Uncharted either. I’m sure there are more, but I can’t remember them<br>
