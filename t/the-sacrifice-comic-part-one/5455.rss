            <p>After reading the comic I really hoped that valve would have included the Bikini Witch, but since they didn’t I’m a bit disappoint.</p>

            <p>Played it last night and loved it. It was disappointing at first because I started offline with bots. Jumped in to an online match with some mates and it became infinitely more fun. Really like the map layouts, although it is a little narrow and maze like.</p>
<p>Can’t wait to hit up Versus tonight!</p>

            <p>You’d think it could just read the L4D1 GCF and slot in the L4D2 weapons and etc, encourage people who only have L4D2 to buy L4D1.</p>
<p>I think I’ve decided to buy the PC version of L4D2.  I can’t play it yet, but it costs less than even one copy of the DLC on the 360.  And on the 360, you have to buy it twice if you want to play it in both games, which is dumb.</p>
<p>I’ll just have to convince my friends to get better computers when I finally trash and rebuild my desktop.</p>

<p>There seems to be an issue with the storyline from the comic and the storyline from the game… In the comic, the survivors raise the bridge, get on a boat, and get the hell outta there. In the Sacrifice DLC, The survivors raise the bridge and it cuts off there. In the Passing, they are… still hanging around the bridge? What? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As you can see in the comic they leave when the weather clears up, they already mentioned they were going to wait it out on the bridge for a bit as well. And I can imagine zoey has no problem helping other survivors do their thing as mentioned heavily by the comic and the game. And with the generator up to full gas they have the means to bring it back up and down for a good long while.</p>
<p>The end.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>yeah. seems like The Passing was from the L4D2 point of view while The Sacrifice is from the L4D1 point of view. Both stories converge in this one.<br>
Then you have the comic which ties in the blanks inbetween and fills in the back story somewhat. But the comic was also confusing they seem to jump back in time a lot.</p>

            <p>I will play this tomorrow or two days from now. Seems like it is impossible to create a new game from the lobby now since it can’t find a server to play on. Everybody tries to play it at the same time hammering Valve’s servers. But this is expected with every new big release from Valve.</p>
<p>I tried hosting it myself (I got 15/15 Mbps connection which should be more than enough) and two of the players had a latency of 200ms (ping). How they got into my lobby I don’t know.
