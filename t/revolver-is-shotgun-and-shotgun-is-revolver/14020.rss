    <title>Revolver is Shotgun and Shotgun is Revolver</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/revolver-is-shotgun-and-shotgun-is-revolver/14020</link>
    <description>I loaded the game after accidentally killing myself and was presented with an interesting change, the revolver and shotgun had changed some properties. My revolver fires normally, sounds like a normal revolver but upon inspection of bullet hit decals on walls and floors it appears to fire like a shotgun. Using the revolver on enemies shows me that the damage is like that of the shotgun not the revolver. Vice Versa for Shotgun. Single shot comes out of the shotgun and is revolver accurate.
I am using the &quot;More accurate shotgun&quot; Mod from the Steam Workshop by Kaleidiscoop. I don&#39;t know how this could affect the glitch but I think it could.
I was also presented with vortigaunt and some HECU models glitching into a single pose.

Will upload images and all that extra information soon but is had been a long night/day and I have work to do.</description>

            <p>Alright, I wasn’t able to recreate the glitch, but I did dig up my screenshots that show vortigaunts in odd poses and a HECU marine who couldn’t decide between being a liquid and a solid. It also shows the shotgun and the revolver and near the center of the screen is the decal the gun makes on the floor/wall. Single shot for shotgun and wide spread shot for revolver. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/UfuhI" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://imgur.com/a/UfuhI</a></p>
<p>EDIT: I found the glitch kinda fun until I remembered I used the shotgun more than the revolver and the ammunition for both did not swap or change in any way. I still only had 6 shots of the revolver, which acted like a shotgun, and 8 shots for the shotgun as a revolver.</p>

            <p>How odd.  The mod in question only modifies the spread values for the weapon_shotgun.dmx file and nothing else, and shouldn’t be affecting the revolver.  Try uninstalling the mod, reloading the save, and see if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>Alternatively, try starting a new game and see if the issue is still there.</p>
