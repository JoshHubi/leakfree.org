    <title>Occasional frameskip/lag spike/sound distortion thing on tram</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/occasional-frameskip-lag-spike-sound-distortion-thing-on-tram/9863</link>
    <description>When I&#39;m on the tram, I get these occasionall split-second &quot;lags&quot; that include audio distortion as well.

It seemed to have trailed off a little, but it seems like I&#39;m getting some occassional split-second frameskips.

I don&#39;t really know how to describe it, it&#39;s just that while on the tram, about 6 times throughout the game skipped for a split second and the audio static/stopped.

I&#39;ve never had this problem with any other game.

Anyone else experience this?

[u]EDIT[/u]: Someone else is experiencing this problem as well (not isolated to tram). See 0:46 of this video: [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx9TrETRg9c&#39;]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx9TrETRg9c[/url]</description>

            <p>Same, seems like BM is using a different program to process ingame audio because when I used to get stutter in HL1 the voice would continue where it left off, here it just skips over to where it would have been.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I get these very issues during the tram ride at the start of the game. Once the tram arrives at Sector C the issues cease.</p>
