    <description>Noticed the on ST,  first Abrams ai is a little wack. Once it drives in into the open and spots you, it will continuously  fire in the direction it last saw you . once you drop back down into cover it just keeps firing. Also If you attempt to circle behind it, it cant reorient itself to lock on you.

Second, is it just me or are the female assassins slower and a lot more lethal with the damage they inflect. Seems they  were just draining my health away to quickly.</description>
