    <description>Yeah, and currently I consider that person my twin or that I&#39;m his clone and I never even noticed it... Accidentally, I have the same profile photo as [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/57720-Nonimportantuser/&#39;]@Nonimportantuser[/url] and I really find it funny since I have a twin or master or whatever and I really think that would be a problem since he or all of you might mistook it a fabrication/plagiarism or what do you want to call it.

Could anyone share to me your experiences if you already had the same thing as mine?...</description>

            <p>If memory serves, he left the team after the initial mod release, as he had become tired of doing game development. I guess after he wasn’t part of the team, he didn’t feel any desire to stay active on the forums.</p>

            <p>Neither of you are creative enough to think of or create a mildly unique avatar so you use something by someone else that amused you, and you two happened to be amused by the same thing, and it’s BM related because this is a BM forum. It’s not too crazy. I think I had the same quote in my sig as someone else for a while.</p>
