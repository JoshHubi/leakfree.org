    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glduke-3d-and-jdoom-doomsday-under-win-7-ultimate-64bit/2839</link>
    <description>i don&#39;t get GLDuke 3D (error message that no duke.grp was found - but the duke.grp is in the right folder) to run and Doomsday has no sound under Win 7 64bit. i&#39;ve set them to compatibility mode already but this doesn&#39;t help.

maybe someone knows how to get them to run proberly under 7 64bit and could help me?</description>
