But i can notice the diffrence between 50 to 100, 100 to 150 and so on.</p>

            <p>Oh hey, someone mentioned some offer of HL2 <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> M for free so I did some checking and found this:<br>
<a href="https://steampowered.com/ati_offer1a/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steampowered.com/ati_offer1a/</a><br>
Not sure if it’s still valid since it doesn’t come up in any searches through the Steam store… someone wanna try it out and see if it’s valid?</p>
<p>EDIT: about ping… I’m not too impressed with my ISP, but none the less, it seems the only servers that show over 300 are in Russia, Thailand and Arab Emirates.  The ones I’ve seen that actually advertise being in Australia seem to ping &lt;250 for me.</p>

<p>I feel the same way.<br>
What the hell is with certain Europeans/Americans complaining about 300+ pings?</p>
<p>Anyway, I think we should find someone that could host a match of the higher voted games. Cameron seems a logical choice to me, but for some people the ping might be 500+ :fffuuu:</p>

<p>You must really play slow games, I don’t know if something is wrong with me but I can clearly see the difference between 50 and 100 ping. More than 100 I consider lag.</p>
<p>It’s not speed that’s affected, it’s timing, and it becomes increasingly delayed with high ping.</p>

<p>TBH, even though there is a <span class="bbcode-i">Gord<span class="bbcode-b">o</span>n Drive</span> near my house, the Gord<span class="bbcode-b">a</span>n sign in my sig is shopped - erm… uh, Gimped would be more accurate, I suppose.<br>
I always thought of HL whenever I saw one of the signs until I started hanging out here - now I always think of Gord<span class="bbcode-b">a</span>n.<br>
Thanks a lot, jerks :hmph::pffft:</p>

            <p>I still vote Sven, I am pretty sure about 99% of us already have HL1, so Sven is free like HL2DM.  If we do do Sven I suggest we play some of the good custom campaigns as the HL1 campaign, no matter how epic, gets old and is too long.</p>
<p>I hope we don’t choose TF2 of TFc, I’ve played and disliked both.</p>

            <p>HL2DM is a game that most (if not all) of us should have for free, so it would probably be the best option.</p>
