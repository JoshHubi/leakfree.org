    <title>Pointless Threads: Changing the English Language</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pointless-threads-changing-the-english-language/3370</link>
    <description>This is probably never going to happen, which is why I labeled it a pointless thread, but nevertheless fun to think about. 

Words like Colonel are impossible to read as &quot;kernel&quot; without being told that it&#39;s pronounced like that because the english language isn&#39;t phonetic.

Should the english language remove unnecessary letters, such as c and q, and replace them with k&#39;s, and such, and become a phonetic language?

examples: cat ---&gt; kat
              suck ---&gt; suk
              sex ---&gt; seks</description>

            <p>Lol, people though that England etc weren’t countries? Massive fail.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t really care if the English language doesn’t always make sense. If you’re going to bitch about languages not making sense, use one of those universal languages instead.</p>

            <p>That’s what shits me off about the British Isles. What exactly do you people call yourselves?</p>
<p>I just call Northern Ireland and England Britain, and everything else by their normal names. Screw this UK nonsense.</p>

            <p>Just to backtrack a bit…</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Hazzmat">

<p>Englishmen say metre, Americans say meter.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Aside from any accent, are you saying there really is a difference between pronouncing <span class="bbcode-i">meter</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">metre</span>?  Because as far as I know, I’ve never heard an Englishman pronounce it “mee-treh” or any other way for that matter.</p>
<p>But more on topic, I’ve always thought the English alphabet was terribly inefficient (at least the Americanized version)… but, I guess that’s what you get when a country is born of many different nationalities and borrows from many different languages.  It changes over time to suit it’s own needs, but I’ll be honest, things like “bouquet” changing to “bokay” is just laziness, imho. (ok, so bokay is far from “official,” but I’ve been seeing it for years and it ticks me off for some reason)</p>

            <p>Well, if we made every single language swedish, we wouldn’t <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> W, since not a single swedish word has W in it AFAIK.</p>
