            <p>One of my friends got a massively old Windows Millineum Laptop as a gift.  The only thing on the hard drive was a drawing of a guy with his dick wrapped between his legs and over his shoulder.  Wow, what a first post.</p>

            <p>That’s cool. I bought the 500GB hard drive after I found out about how inexpensive wintronics is, before I was using just an 80GB HD. Check it out the prices they have on hard drives:</p>

<p>The one I bought last year is now only 60$</p>

            <p>haha yeah.</p>
<p>I added <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=94066&amp;postcount=6" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the price list and the temperatures</a> under the photos, check it out.</p>
<p>Most of this was before I found out that there’s a Wintronic Computers in my area so if I would have known it wouldn’t have cost that much.</p>

<p>Well, the location the computer is in, it’s not all that bad really. I like the clean set up.

            <p>Now here are the photos of the mutimedia computer I built for 564$ in 2007</p>
<p>Motherboard (ECS 761gxM754) + CPU (Sempron 3400+)= 69$ (discount from usual 110$ because the Pentium 4 motherboard I bought failed and fried my processor)<br>
DVD drive = 30$<br>
Asus Geforce 8500GT Silent = 85$<br>
2GB of OCZ DDR400 RAM = 80$<br>
7.1 Channel PCI sound card = 0$ (gift)<br>
Floppy drive = 0$<br>
case and power supply = 50$ total<br>
Fans = 58$ in total.<br>
CPU cooler = 25$<br>
card reader = 30$<br>
fan grills = 5$<br>
spray paint (black and white) = 20$<br>
metal handles = 10$<br>
IDE Hard Drive swap = 17$<br>
500GB Seagate Barracuda SATA Hard Drive = 85$</p>

<p>With all those fans blowing the hot air out from the back and the side, the temperatures are:</p>
<p>Via Chipset 28C to 32C<br>
IDE 30C to 34C<br>
SATA 28C to 30C<br>
Sempron 29C to 35C<br>
Video Card 40C to 47C</p>
<p>So the computer will last a while since it’s cool and quite silent.</p>

            <p>I know!! that’s the uncool part of it, it’s messy.</p>
<p>I was given the hard drive cause the guy who owned the computer didn’t come pick up his stuff after a year of moving out so his friends threw everything out.</p>
<p>↓ Well the Hard Drive I copied these photos off of is 30GB so it’s probably from like 2003 or 2004.</p>
