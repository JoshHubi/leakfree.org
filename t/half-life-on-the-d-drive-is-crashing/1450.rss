    <title>Half Life on the D drive is crashing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-on-the-d-drive-is-crashing/1450</link>
    <description>So, long story short, I uninstalled Steam from the C drive (93 GB ), cleaned up the registry, and reinstalled on the D drive (80 GB ).  Half Life 2, EP1, EP2, and Portal all work fine.

Half Life...loads for a split second without the menu ever appearing (but you see the background image of Gordon with a shotgun) and then mysteriously crashes.  Ditto for Blue Shift.

However...Opposing Force works perfectly and *doesn&#39;t* crash.

Any idea what might be going on?</description>

            <p>The issue was the DEP.  I enabled it for Half Life specifically and now it works.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I don’t think I was entirely clear. The dreamcast version used a modified version of goldsrc, which wasn’t entirely compatible with the PC version. It’s similar enough that the maps mostly work, but different enough that there are several game-breaking bugs. At least, that’s what my sources tell me.</p>

<p>I don’t think that’s what happened.</p>
<p>The dreamcast runs windows CE, not compatible with win32 code, they probably had access to the GoldSRC source code and all they had to do is compile it again for PC (after making small changes).</p>
<p>Also, CS was released for the Dreamcast and I think it was by Gearbox, so it wasn’t <span class="bbcode-i">entirely</span> abandoned, also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbLL9JymQiM&amp;feature=related" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbLL9JymQiM&amp;feature=related</a></p>

            <p>Yeah, the reason steam BS is so buggy is that when the dreamcast version of Half-Life was cancelled, Gearbox didn’t bother porting the maps for Blue Shift over to goldsrc, they just ported the dreamcast version of goldsrc to the pc. When Blue shift was released over steam, rather than modifying the blue shift engine to work with steam or converting the maps to the PC version, they just packaged the maps with the original, Half-Life version of goldsrc. Which obviously didn’t work out so well. Blue Shift: Unlocked just ported the blue shift maps to the correct format.</p>

            <p>well, hl2, hl2dm, ep1, ep2, portal all have hl2.exe, but they run on different engines in the same way as Half-Life and op4 run on different engines. It’s technically the same engine I guess, but Op4’s is upgraded. Unless valve reverted to the original goldsrc for the steam version like they did with blue shift…</p>

            <p>Interesting.  In my Opposing Force folder is hl.exe just like Blue Shift and Half Life.  Assumed (incorrectly) that all three used the same engine.</p>
<p>Which…unfortunately doesn’t get me anywhere.  Anyone have any crazy or half baked idea that might get to the bottom of this?</p>

            <p>what is this? this sounds like exactly the setup I have. I use Vista, I’ve installed Steam on my D:\ drive and I’ve had no problems. I specifically run it in OpenGL too. Same for all the mods I run as well. All my goldsource games run fine too.</p>
<p>I’m sorry I can’t help more with what your problem actually is, but I can tell you it’s not any of that stuff.</p>
<p>the only thing I can recommend is first, through steam, select your half life game and delete local content, then go into your steamapps folder and delete your half life folder completely, then re-download it. Then check to see if it will run at all before you add any mods at all.<br>
I found that if I sometimes get a bad game download, it deals some file(dunno which one) that doesn’t get deleted when steam uninstalls the game.</p>

            <p>hmm. So it’s something with the hl1 version of goldsrc. try deleting whichever gfc has the engine in it and redownloading. Or maybe reinstall on the original drive to see if it works there?</p>

            <p>Verifying was the first thing my Steam support ticket suggested I do.  Didn’t help, unfortunately, but thank you.</p>
<p>I don’t know if there’s an issue with the hard drive, I doubt it.  It’s only Half Life and Blue Shift (and Half Life mods like Someplace Else) that are messing up.  Opposing Force works…anything on the Source engine works.  Several other non-Steam programs work.</p>

            <p>Right click on the non-working games from the Steam menu and select Properties, Local Files tab, Verify Integrity button to check the game files. Can’t believe no-one’s suggested this yet.</p>
<p>If you’re convinced that there’s something wrong with that hard-drive, run scandisk or some other disk checking software too (under XP right-click the drive, select Properties, Tools tab, Error Checking button, for example).</p>

<p>Yeah, I originally had saved my steamapps folder, but then after Half Life/Blue Shift kept crashing I just deleted it and tried to start completely fresh…didn’t help.  Bleh.</p>
