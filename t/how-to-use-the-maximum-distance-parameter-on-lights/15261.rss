    <title>How to use the &#39;Maximum Distance&#39; parameter on lights.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-use-the-maximum-distance-parameter-on-lights/15261</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been messing around with the &#39;Maximum Distance&#39; parameter to try to deal with those annoying &#39;lighting pileup&#39; issues on my maps, but it doesn&#39;t seem to do anything at all. Does anyone know what this is for? Is there a [i]proper[/i] way to use it? The Source wiki just repeats the FGD description &quot;This is the distance that light is allowed to cast, in inches.&quot;, which is less than informative.</description>

The Source wiki just repeats the FGD description “This is the distance that light is allowed to cast, in inches.”, which is less than informative.</p>
