<p>Maybe he isn’t a dumbass, maybe he’s a con man. I don’t think an idiot would be smart enough to attempt to sue a majorr company. But then again it’d take an idiot to try and sue a major company let alone over such a retarded complaint.</p>

            <p>Whether or not he has the conditions are irrelevant actually. He knew when he agreed to this contract (the one which we all agree to when playing a game online) that he had these conditions, and therefore agreed he would not do these things even though he knew full well he couldn’t. Even if he is physically incapable of keeping the contract, he still signed the contract stating he would uphold it.</p>
<p>Thus, whether or not he is incapable of holding it is irrelevant because he signed a contract fully claiming he could and would knowing full well he couldn’t.</p>

</aside>
<p>I definitely agree with the last one. You’ve got so many more degrees of freedom in the computer realm than the console realm (I still love my console, though). Though, if the article has taught us anything, it’s that this guy is a complete asshole, and he’ll probably fail on the computer as well.</p>

            <p>This is stupid and the guy isn’t going to stand a chance in court. When you agree to someone else’s terms and then turn around and violate them, you kind of lose your ability to sue someone for pain and suffering brought on by the loss of such services…especially if you bring it on yourself…</p>
<p>Basically this is like signing a contract saying “I won’t be an ass”, then being an ass and expecting to sue the person who offered you the contract.</p>

            <p>I’m surprised that there are people stupid enough, and apparently asshole enough, to take such an idiotic case to court. I especially love his attempt at using the Mature rating as a valid argument. Nobody in this country gives a shit about the rating system. Even then, the ESRB states that “game experience may change during online play.” With all the trash talkers, d-bags, and bullshit out there, all online portions of a game might as well be rated AO(for those of you who have seen the youtube videos, I hope you’ll agree with me here). The First Amendment aside, and considering the above, the only thing holding the networks together is the Online User Agreement, which this guy clearly violated. He therefore has no valid argument and, as such, should fuck off. I hope this guy gains some valuable experience from this encounter, and learns not to be such a douche in the future.  But I doubt that.</p>

            <p>Wow, this is just hilarious… It can’t possibly be infringing on his first amendment rights because he agreed to a binding contract. You would think people would actually take the time to think… but then again I suppose that’s asking too much.</p>
<p>I hope he doesn’t win. Nothing sickens me more than when someone who sues like this wins even though common sense itself says he should have lost.</p>
