    <title>How to copy HL2 via modding</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-copy-hl2-via-modding/12142</link>
    <description>So, I have a question. I tried to copy HL2 by modding it in SDK (2006), but it ended up making a mod of Episode 2. So I tried again, and Lost Coast. I don&#39;t want to start up a new game on my original because I just want to play around with cheats, but it seems to be proving rather difficult. Can anyone help me?

            <p>What he said. You’ll save yourself lots of time and effort if you just backup your saves, do your playing around, then put them back later.</p>
<p>The cheats won’t affect anything except disable achievements, but those are re-enabled when you disable cheats.</p>

            <p>Start a new game and delete the saves when you’re done then. That’s what I do.<br>
All that extra time and effort seems pointless if you just want to play with cheats, they’re not gonna permanently fuck up your copy or anything.</p>
