    <title>Lambda Core finale crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lambda-core-finale-crash/11991</link>
    <description>Hello,

Firstly thanks alot for the mod. Its absolutely amazing and definitely worth the wait. I spent most my evening yesterday playing through it and this morning have made it to the teleporter in Lambda core. Sadly I am now unable to finish the mod since it keeps crashing =( 
The crash occurs shortly after the Controllers teleport to try and prevent the activation of the device. 
I&#39;ve had several crashes before but this is the first one that hasn&#39;t been solved by a game reload. Please help!

I&#39;ve included the MDMP with this post.

I&#39;m playing the mod on an Alienware M14X laptop running Windows 8.
