    <title>I&#39;m Saving Up Money To Move To Palm Beach, Florida</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/im-saving-up-money-to-move-to-palm-beach-florida/14594</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t want to deal with winter anymore. Last year just sucked away my endurance for cold and snow. And yet hear I am, still in New Jersey, it is cold out, it is snowing, and I don&#39;t want to deal with it anymore. I have approximately $7,000 in the bank right now, I owe my mother $2,000, and I figure I need a good $15,000 to be able to start a new life down the coast/ I save between $500 to $600 a month, so in around 20 months I will be moving away, and so I keep chanting to myself, just $10,000 more and I can move to Florida. Just $10,000 more and I am moving to Florida. Just $10,000 more...

I did a little bit of research, and am continuing to do more. An average two bedroom apartment was almost affordable, and I only need one. Plus I saw a job listing a few months ago offing more money than I make here in Jersey for the same work I am doing now. So things don&#39;t look so bad from up here.

I just need to save up for the moving costs.</description>

            <p>I finally got a call back from an architectural firm in Florida. I should have an interview with them at their office here in Jersey just outside of Philly in the next couple of weeks. Here’s hoping it’s a good fit and I can earn a living wage…</p>

            <p>On Monday I informed my boss of my intentions to defect to Florida. He offered to set up a remote office for me down there so that he could start another house in Jupiter, in addition to the one that we are about to build in Boca Raton…</p>
<p>But I don’t think I can work like that again, as I already did it for around 15 years before working for him. I would rather be in a full office with coworkers in the same room as me.</p>

<p>I live on the south coast of England and man it’s not exactly cheap, in actual fact if you can commit it’s cheaper to buy a house then throw all the money out on rent. you’re looking between (area dependent) $250000-$480000 for a pretty standard 1-3 bed house for the average joe.</p>
