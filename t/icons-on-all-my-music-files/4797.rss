    <title>Icons on all my music files!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/icons-on-all-my-music-files/4797</link>
    <description>Since today, all of the sudden all my music files (in Tiles View) have this little icon overlay. It&#39;s on every music file in every folder and it&#39;s annoying as hell.

I haven&#39;t changed any of my folder setting and I don&#39;t know what could&#39;ve caused this. does anyone know how to restore it to its original state with no icons?</description>

            <p>The files are all on my HDD (both internal and external), and like I said, they’ve now changed to the Winamp icon in the lower right corner.</p>
<p>Still, it used to be icon-free, and I have no idea why it changed all of the sudden.</p>

            <p>Try disable Windows media player network sharing?<br>
(That might fix the network icon on audio files, as for catz other thread, no idea)</p>

            <p>Is the file on a flash drive or something? or is it actually on your hard drive?</p>

            <p>It looks to me like Windows thinks your files are on a network drive.<br>
Maybe there’s a registry key that’s corrupt (?).</p>

            <p>I got nuthin then.  My problem was trying to figure out the official word for what it represented. Once I figured out it was the “overlay arrow” I was able to google it and fix it.  Is it a sort/view kinda thing?</p>
<p>EDIT:  Is this music waiting to be written to cd?</p>
<p>Here is a list of overlay icons that come with Windows 7.<br>
Small arrow: This is the shortcut overlay.<br>
Lock icon: This means that you have a private item in a non-private directory. This indicates that it is a file or folder with special permissions  &amp; that the user is restricted from performing some operations on that file or folder.<br>
Downward pointing blue arrow: This is the “to be written to CD” overlay.<br>
Pair of green swirly arrows: This means that the item is available offline.<br>
Gray X: This means that the file has been archived to tape and will take a very long time to access.<br>
Shield: This means that the program requires elevation to run and that a UAC prompt may appear.</p>

            <p>Well, after rebooting the icon changed to a small Winamp icon in the lower left corner. But they never had any icons on them before, it defeats the whole purpose of having music files with album art.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to revert the Tiles view so they have no icons anymore?</p>
<p>Catz, that’s only for the shortcut arrow, not regular icons. But thanks anyway  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>oh hai! I just had this issue too.  Try installing “UltimateWindowsTweaker” and then tell it to turn off the overlay arrow.</p>
