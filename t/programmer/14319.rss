1. A willingness and ability to communicate via VOIP software (like Skype). 
* Must have strong command of the English language (both via text and verbally).

1. Past experience with or willingness to work on a large team.
1. Willing and able to start [b]immediately[/b].

We give [b]strong[/b] preference to candidates that have the any of the following skills in addition to the above:
1. Experience with the Source Engine.
* [i]Seriously: If you know Source, [email=jobs@blackmesasource.com]apply[/email].[/i]

1. Experience with any game engine.
* [i]Doesn&#39;t have to be Source.[/i]

1. Demonstrable prior experience in game development.
* [i]This can be an unreleased prototype, a shipped title, anything that shows you know what goes into making a game.[/i]

[b]Note:[/b] This position involves compensation for work. Should we decide to move forward with your application, a skills test will be administered to determine competency.
