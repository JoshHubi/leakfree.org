            <p>2 things to try first:<br>
-Plug your speakers into a different source, like a CD or MP3 player. Do they still crackle?<br>
-Try plugging headphones into your soundcard. Any crackling?</p>
<p>This will give you a nice starting point so you know where the problem is  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>they aren’t that old, it’s the Logitech X-530 5.1 speaker set with extension cables, which are probably the problem.</p>

<p>If you mean electrical extension, try sticking a ferrite bead on the cable</p>

            <p>I get a distinct crackle from my PC speakers when I touch my mouse and drag my foot on the carpet. That one is making me nervous. It is a new phenomenon.</p>

<p>Your speakers aren’t shielded properly, if they’re old a new set should solve that problem  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The last time my speakers were crackling was from the sound card kicking the bucket. Of course it goes without saying that if there is a lot of dust in the PC case that might also contribute to the problem. I would however try rolling back the drivers first to see if that was the problem.</p>
