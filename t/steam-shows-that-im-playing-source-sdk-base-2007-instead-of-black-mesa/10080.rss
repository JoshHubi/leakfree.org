    <title>Steam shows that I&#39;m playing Source SDK Base 2007 instead of Black Mesa.</title>

    <description>I&#39;m having a small issue. Steam is displaying &quot;Source SDK Base 2007&quot; instead of Black Mesa as the current game I&#39;m playing. Is this normal?
I&#39;m able to launch and play the game normally (downloaded it from torrent).</description>

            <p>It said Source SDK Base 2007 for me first time I launched it directly after install. But after that first round, restart your steam and the game “Black Mesa” should appear in your library (game list). If you launch that it should say “In-mod Black Mesa” as steam status.</p>
<p>As a side note, game time played will be recorded on your profile when it’s Source SDK Base 2007. Not when playing the In-mod, as it’s not Steam official yet.</p>
