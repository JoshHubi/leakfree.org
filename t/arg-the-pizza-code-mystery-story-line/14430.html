<p>Gunsrequiem</p>
<p>[spoiler]</p>
<p><a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Storyline" data-bbcode="true">https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Storyline</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Please note before you read this that this is simply my take (Gunsrequiem) on the entire Pizza Code Mystery story, and is not something that should be considered set in stone by any means.  Hopefully, by highlighting some key points and putting my personal spin on them, it will incite some ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So, without further ado, here it is:</span></p>
<p>I think it has become rather obvious that Dr. Horn set up the HALOS project in the X01 and X02 rooms of the BMRF.  As we can see from the letter on Welsh’s website, only Dr. Horn, Paul Bottomley, and perhaps Dr. Junek had access to the HALOS project.  Furthermore, Horn was using the lab budget to buy pizzas and fund the project.  In an attempt to get back at Dr. Horn, Welsh and some of his buddies decide to play a prank on him by taking his pizzas and hiding them throughout the facility.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, however, it’s important to understand what we can about the HALOS project.  It is definitely some sort of artificial intelligence–we can derive that from a number of sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120924002541/thepizzaisalie/images/thumb/5/51/C0a1x_labboard_am1.jpg/1000px-C0a1x_labboard_am1.jpg" data-bbcode="true">whiteboard</a>      in “Anomalous Materials” that has a note directed to Paul      Bottomley that asks him to call J.D. Marcel on ext. 1187-463 about the      Niobium-5 that he needs for that “AI project ‘thing’”.  It      is signed “Dr. Montero”</li>
<li>The <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Tempus_omnia_revelant" data-bbcode="true">Tempus omnia revelant</a> page added to the      wiki has a section that shows a report with the author as {HALOS      AUTOMATED}</li>
<li>The      messages sent out by “someone mysterious” are probably partially      sent out by the HALOS AI, particularly because of the way they are      worded.  They sound very machine-like and inorganic.<br>
That said, the HALOS project is definitely a very crucial entity to Dr. Horn, and it seems as though the HALOS system is still in contact with Dr. Horn after he “escaped” the BMRF.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what about the relationship between Horn and Welsh?  Well, apparently Horn got pretty pissed off that Welsh was taking his “misbegotten goods”, as we can see from the image attached with the wiki page that Horn scribbled all over in red.  He writes, “Stone will pay” and “Steals it, eats it”.  Either Horn really loves his pizza, or he is pissed that his secret funding is a bust.  My money’s on the latter.</p>
<p>When all hell breaks loose in the Black Mesa facility, Horn gets out.  Paul Bottomley is dead (or is he?), probably killed by the military.  Everyone else is running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Horn knows he’s the last man standing that can continue the HALOS project–so, what does he do?  He activates the AI project, basically giving it the option to fend for itself.</p>
<p>This is where the IRC chat clues come into play.  I believe these are coming from someone in an attempt to give Horn directions and aid him in setting up another HALOS site.  The second IRC chat clue points him towards Niobium, a vital ingredient for the HALOS project (as we saw on the “Anomolous Materials” whiteboard).  The third clue states that the 41Nb was recovered and that the HAFB was compromised.  Perhaps this is Horn sending this message to the secretive individual that sent the first message.  However, it’s important to note the Tempus omnia revelant wiki page that mentions “…Sending MINDAT via HAFB”.  Either Horn or the HALOS AI was sending mineral data via the Hollomans Air Force Base.</p>
<p>In the same clue that identifies HAFB as being compromised, the message identifies the White Sands Missile Range as “no longer viable”, then suggests that the message’s receiver move to the main site.  The next IRC chat message then states that access was detected at the personal site, the security therefore compromised.  It identifies the HALOS project as being under threat, then states that the site is offline as a response.  There was an embedded message as well:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">prime site compromised return bmrf login halos</span></p>
<p>The next message definitely appears as though it arises from an AI, for it is in all caps and is attempting multiple methods of attack–it also appears to be attempting to connect to Horn, as it says, “ATTEMPTING CONNECT TO USER H . . . .”</p>
<p>Finally, we are left with the message left for Dr. Horn (by whom?) that reminds him of the password “BENALOHPAILLIER” in case of emergencies.  And, as we know, there has obviously been a serious emergency.  It also says, “You should bring pizzas”, which means that the person (or thing) sending this message was part of the original HALOS project at BMRF, which then identifies why Horn had to buy so much pizza.  Whoever was helping Horn with the HALOS project seemed to love pizza, which makes me wonder if the strange messenger is in fact Paul Bottomley.  They were working together at BMRF, so it makes sense that it would be Bottomley.</p>
<p>And then we come to the latest clue.  It appears to be sent by the HALOS AI, stating that the primary site is offline and the primary servers are overloaded.  It then mentions that a user activation is required–PASSCODE INPUT FOR SITE ACTIVATION REQUIRED, and the final test pattern has been set.</p>
<p>So, alas, this is where we stand.  BMRF is toast, completely annihilated by the combination of forces Gordon Freeman had to deal with.  Horn is on the run, perhaps holed up in some remote location attempting to get back into the HALOS AI program, or even attempting to reroute it to his current location.  The message left by Bottomley about bringing pizzas suggests he is still alive and still in contact with Horn.  Welsh is holed up somewhere too, because he is responsible for the first IRC chat clue.  Either that or it was sent before the onset of the BMRF massacre and he is now toast because of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve done the best I can to provide some sort of narrative, and even if it’s completely wrong (which I’m sure a good chunk of it is), I hope it will still spark some fresh lines of thought.[/size][/spoiler]</p>

<p>Summary of Clues: [/size]</p>
<p>When we first discovered the codes, we noted that there were four codes to be found.  These codes were set up by Dr. Horn, which led us to realize it was Stormseeker (Chris Horn) setting up the majority of this.  The primary code D, the one that led to the last digits needed for the “thepizzaisalie” site, was directed to a <span class="bbcode-b">Dr. Bottomley</span>, who has since been identified as one of Storm’s friends.</p>
<p>There were also a couple of IRC clues given prior to the solving of the other web-based clues.  These were:</p>
<ol>
<li>The IRC      clue “editing” the Konami Code cipher (Code A), although it has      been hinted that the original form “bon ami” was intentional,      for it means “good friend”.  This chat clue also states,      “Don’t let him find us–Dr. Welsh”, suggesting that Dr. Welsh      was a key player in the ARG, as well.  We found out later, via      Welsh’s profile site, that this <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> the case.</li>
<li>The second      IRC clue that first mentions coordinates:</li>
</ol>
<p>N38°57’8.05" W77°8’44.82".Solution two ignore loc data N32°52’50.77" W106°20’49.40" not buried at initial loc, fly here.Travel 14.16 miles east we transferred the niobium there.Await further instructions.<br>

Now, we have no idea who these messages are being sent to, but we can speculate that they originate with Dr. Horn because they mention the missing / hidden X01 and X02 rooms.  They also mention the HALOS project which has become synonymous with Dr. Horn’s later clues.</p>
<p>After discovering the website and solving the binary puzzle, we then began getting web-based puzzles.  These began with this puzzle, that turned out to be Base 64 with a Navajo message inside of it, which then needed a Playfair cipher to finish it off:</p>

<p>We may be stuck here, but I think we have all the information we need.  We have a login and a password, and I don’t think the password is a direct key to the actual cipher, but should simply be used to access the HALOS site, whatever that may be.  We seem to have overlooked the other clues, and I think we need to put them together to make this next big leap and pass through the gate to the next portion.  With this in mind, maybe we need to look at other possible sites / links that have previously been added or left undiscovered.</p>

<p>For some reason, “he” is not in bold, while the other letters are in both italics and bold. And, if you look closely, there are some letters in the text that are in bold but not italics, they seem to spell out “Is AI”.</p>
<p>On one of the <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/File:C0a1x_labboard_am1.jpg" data-bbcode="true">whiteboards</a>, there’s a note from Dr. Montero about Dr. J.D. Marcel needing Niobium 5 for “that AI project ‘thing’”.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“It is one thing to communicate with something mysterious but it is quite another to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether it understands the same concept of reason that we do.” </span></p>
<p>This quote seems to combine two layers of meaning in a brilliant way. First, it might say something about whatever it is that’s “watching this all from the shadows”. Secondly, as Primadog noted, this quote is from a Star Trek TNG episode titled “Justice”. From the story clues so far, we know that someone (or something?) wants Dr. Welsh and Dr. Stone to pay for something they did. In other words, you might say he (or it?) is seeking justice.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/File:C2a4x_labboard15.jpg" data-bbcode="true">“budget” whiteboard</a> there’s this note:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Note: Specimen Transfer Monday 09:00 Lambda Complex =&gt; Platform 2 <span class="bbcode-u">Lower Section</span> - Biodome – </span></p>
<p>Under it, a note of warning:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Be aware, location is still under construction - wear a hard hat! </span></p>
<p>If these two clues are related, they seem to suggest there’s some sort of construction work (expansion?) going on in the lower levels of the Biodome Complex. If we consider the ethically questionable research being done in the Biodome Complex, we could very well call it some kind of hell. What is this work currently under way in the sub levels of the facility? Could this be what the tenth circle symbol is hinting at - a new level of hell in the lower sections of the Biodome Complex?</p>

<p>About the taco shack: I’m not sure if it means anything, but the fact that you can only reach the shack through a portal, could be a clue. Also, on the table outside the shack, there are three plates and three forks, on the ground there are three soda cans. Inside the shack, there’s a plate with three tacos and there are three soda cans in the trash can. This might suggest that Dr. Horn had a meal there with two of his colleagues (possibly Dr. Bottomley and Dr. Junek?) while privately discussing the secret project (HALOS?). The shack also seems well connected to the outside world with the two satellite dishes on the roof. But then again, this could just be an easter egg with no relevance to the ARG.</p>
<p>About this quote (also from the 1001085139140914 file):</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“When you’re building a cage for Satan, you don’t ask him to wait around whilst you put the doors on.” </span></p>
<p>I’m wondering if Dr. Horn could be talking about a “cage” for the AI here?</p>
<p>There’s a concept for an artificial intelligence called an “Oracle AI”, which is a kind of a “boxed” AI, designed for answering questions, with no networking capabilities or connections to the outside world, except for a simple human interface. The idea is to create a “friendly” AI that is safe to use and operate, by limiting the AI’s ability to reach and/or expand beyond its confines and do things we don’t want it to do.</p>
<p>Perhaps “Satan’s cage” is an allusion to this concept. The AI could have been active and running for quite some time before they had finished installing it in its intended operating environment. Maybe they needed to keep it busy with a complex problem while they finished the installation. But something didn’t quite go according to plan, possibly due to something Dr. Stone and Dr. Welsh did. Instead, the AI turned its focus on the scientists, observing them and the environment.</p>
<p>But I have no idea how the pizzas could fit into to this scenario.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT 2:</span></p>
<p>Maybe Dr. Horn was using pizzas as part of a reward system for the AI. In order to train the AI and keep it goal oriented, he needed to introduce a reward system. At the same time, the AI could have been given the capability to grow and expand its own circuits by consuming raw materials like Niobium. Furthermore, in an attempt to give the AI human like characteristics he introduced the concept of food in the form of pizzas. But the real sustenance was primarily Niobium, so he had to season the pizzas with Niobium salt. He referred to these specially prepared pizzas as “grilled pizzas”. Every time the AI successfully solved a problem or completed a task he gave it, he would reward it with a “grilled pizza”. Hence the phrase “congratulationsyouwonthePIZZA”, it was not meant for us, it was in fact meant for the AI.<br>
However, the minute Dr. Stone and Dr. Welsh decided to steal all of Dr. Horn’s “grilled pizzas” with the Niobium, they unwittingly set in motion a chain of events that quickly spiralled out of control.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">I dont have time for full writeup, but what if the AI is doing some sort of paperclip optimization, but with the Pizzas. Ordering tons of pizzas. </span></p>
<p>Yes, the dreaded <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer" data-bbcode="true">paperclip maximizer</a> problem.</p>
<p>I can imagine a scenario where this could have started with something innocuous, and then escalated out of control.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>While working on an active prototype version of the AI, priming and testing it for its intended purpose, Dr. Horn could have fallen for the temptation of using the AI as his personal aide, so to speak, so he could work more efficiently. One of the tasks he gave it was to order a pizza for him once a day. But then one day, Security Officer Sisk ate one of Dr. Horn’s pizzas. The next day, Dr. Stone stole one of his pizzas. The AI somehow sensed that pizzas were disappearing and adapted to this situation by increasingly ordering more and more pizzas. And thus, a “pizza maximizer” was born.</p>
<p>While Dr. Horn was trying to correct the problem and get the situation under control, Dr. Stone and Dr. Welsh started their campaign against Dr. Horn, and prevented all pizzas from being delivered to Dr. Horn’s lab. The AI would now completely lock itself into this “pizza maximizing” loop, and the situation would get completely out of hand. The AI would start exhibiting unpredictable and dangerous behaviour, and the health and safety of the other scientists and employees working in the facility would be at risk.</p>
<p>The problems with the AI would now have posed a serious threat to the HALOS project, and Dr. Horn would blame his “malevolent” colleagues for turning “a minor glitch” into a serious setback for the project. The HALOS project seems to be very important to him on a personal level, and that is probably why he swore he would pay them back for what they had done.</p>
<p>This scenario, however, doesn’t explain why the pizza is a lie. Unless the lie is referring to Dr. Horn not admitting he made a mistake when he used the AI as his personal aide, which caused the problems to begin with, and then tried to cover it up and proceeded with the project despite the problems with the AI. I’m not sure if this is the right story, though.</p>

<p>We know Dr Horn escaped from BMRS, then who sent out this message? Is it the AI? If it isn’t (assuming the AI was offline during this message), then who’s left alive in BMRS to message Dr Horn? Bottomley? Welsh? Freeman himself?[/i]</p>
<p>I can’t say I have a good idea exactly who sent out this message, but to me it looks like it could be someone coordinating the HALOS project, or someone in the field, who recovered the Niobium supplies and transferred it to the new site, where the HALOS project were going to be set up. Note that this message is not from an “unknown source”, while most of the other messages are, except the HALOS file, which is from a “classified source”.</p>

<p>This pizza baker must have made a sizable profit during the time these events took place.</p>
<p>Dr. Bonami?</p>
<p>Looking back at the <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Code_A" data-bbcode="true">Code A</a> message, if it was not incorrectly enciphered, then who is this Dr. Bonami? Yes, it was a hint to do the Konami code, but what if Dr. Bonami is part of this story?</p>
<p>We know that Dr. Welsh was complaining about the endless lists of tasks to complete that Dr. Horn was handing out to him and Dr. Foreman, and we can find one example of such a list on Dr. Foreman’s desk. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that Dr. Horn would also have given the AI various tasks to do if he saw fit to do so, even if these tasks were not directly related to his work (like ordering pizzas). But maybe Dr. Horn developed some sort of relationship with the AI. With the mounting friction between him and his disgruntled colleagues, it is not unlikely that he would come to consider the AI to be his only trusted friend and colleague. And so, he would call the AI by the name Dr. Bonami, or maybe vice versa.</p>
<p>This, of course, assuming the AI was already an active entity from very early on in the story.</p>

<p>I think a problem we’re all struggling with in this ARG, is that it isn’t at all clear exactly who (or what) is doing what. This makes it difficult to make sense of what’s going on in the story, without being creative in order to fill in the blanks. But coming up with “credible” ideas that fit all the evidence, seems to be rather difficult. But I suppose that’s part of the challenge.</p>

<p>[i]The message on stormseeker’s site (terminal page) says:<br>
“I have long suspected that there was something stRange going on during the development of this facility. The unexplained disappearances, misappropriation of funds regarding cheesy oven-baked bread products and an ominous feeling that something is constantly watching this all from the shadows, Have added up to create something that needs solving, and sOlving fast”</p>
<p>If we run under the idea this is Dr. Horn (reasonable,) it almost seems as if Dr. Horn is not ordering them the deaths nor the pizzas, although this contradicts other evidence. But then who is? And what unexplained disappearances? Dr. Stone? Are we instead looking for Dr. Stone or his killer? What would be Dr. Horn’s motivation for offering <span class="bbcode-u">a reward</span> to those who compromised the security and knowledge of his secret lab(s)? It doesn’t make sense.[/i]</p>
<p>I’m just playing with an idea here; it almost seems as if there are two versions of Dr. Horn at work here, sort of like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde case. One is good, the other evil. One loves tacos, the other is obsessed with pizzas. When Dr. Horn is himself, he has no recollection or memory of what his alter ego has been doing. But he soon realizes that something strange is going on, and proceeds to investigate the matter. Maybe “the good” Dr. Horn is able to sense some of what’s happening to him on a subconscious level. This would feed his paranoia and his ominous feeling that something is watching it all from the shadows. He can’t trust anyone at the facility, so he enlists our help.</p>
<p>If this is the case, it might explain some of the contradictory evidence. But why is Dr. Horn then suffering from this split personality disorder? Could it be that he’s a victim of mind control exerted upon him by the mysterious AI we’ve been hearing about, or some other entity, to be used as an instrument for some ulterior purpose?</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">(And a side note - the wiki says P. Bottomley is Administrator, but according to the “lists” journal note found on Welsh’s resume image, Dr. Montero is the main administrator…not Bottomley.</span></p>
<p>Outside Dr. Bottomley’s office there’s a sign that says “Dr Bottomley, Administrator”. His office is located in the Biodome Complex, which houses the Advanced Biological Research Lab, where we find Dr. Horn’s office and labs. Presumably, Dr. Bottomley is Administrator of the Advanced Biological Research Lab. So, it looks like Dr. Montero could be the administrator of the entire Black Mesa Research Facility (although in the original Half-Life series, the Administrator was a character called Dr. Breen.) Also, note that Dr. Montero is an in-game character named after Carlos Montero, who is the project leader of the team that is developing the Black Mesa game.</p>

<p>This says to me that <span class="bbcode-u">Dr. Marcel</span> is the one building an AI ‘thing’ (<span class="bbcode-b">not</span> anyone at the BM facility,) which research into the TV show Bugs shows is correct, i.e. Cyberax…<span class="bbcode-u">NOT Dr. Bottomly OR Dr. Horn…</span> The second part of this season’s cliffhanger was called “A Cage for Satan” which I believe is where the quote is from.

<p>Next, the extension of “1184.463” left for JD Marcel does not look like any extension I’ve <em>ever</em> seen in any phone system… it DOES look like something <span class="bbcode-u">computer related</span> though, although I can’t think what off the top of my head. It could also possibly be part of a Lat/Lon location, but finding where the divisions are might require a bit of sleuthing - although we have another L/L where we’re told the N5 has been moved to - <span class="bbcode-u">something we REALLY need to look more into…</span>[/i]</p>
<p>It seems as if the story in this ARG has been largely inspired by the season two story arc of the TV show Bugs. I haven’t seen the show myself either, but I’ve skimmed through some of the episode synopses/recaps found here: <a href="https://www.episodeguide.us/bugs.html" data-bbcode="true">episodeguide.us/bugs.html</a>. Episodes of interest are 2-7: “Schrödinger’s Bomb” and onwards. I found references to Niobium 5, Niobium 5 processors, a malevolent AI called Cyberax, which seemed to be able to take control over some part of people’s minds by means of some kind of headset. There are also references to something called the Technolopis Tower. Apparently, the character Jean-Daniel Marcel, who was a villain, desperately needed to procure Niobium 5 in order to finish his dream project–the Technopolis Tower–in time. I’m wondering if HALOS might be something similar to this Technopolis Tower.</p>
<p>The 1187-463 extension is also a reference from the show. 1187-463 was the prison cell number in which the character Jean-Daniel Marcel was incarcerated.</p>
<p>Reading some of these synopses piqued my interest, and now I’m actually considering ordering the complete DVD box set, LOL.</p>

<p>“ComLabs Test Initiative” raises some questions. What is it? Is it part of the story? Or, is it a reference meant to hint at something?</p>
<p>If we look at it in the broader context of the story, and also considering the fact that “HALOS DEPT” suggests that the HALOS Project has its own department, “…ComLabs Test Initiative - HALOS Project” seems to hint that the scale of the operation associated with the HALOS Project by far surpasses that of a secret side project in some lab at the BMRF. But if the “ComLabs Test Initiative” is significant in the story somehow, then is the ComLabs Test Initiative a part of the HALOS Project, or is the HALOS Project a part of the ComLabs Test Initiative?</p>

<span class="bbcode-i">Actually, come to think of it, we haven’t been looking much into ways the ARG might be referencing 2001: A Space Odyssey. We already have a few Portal references scattered around. I know the movie fairly well, but so far nothing that ties back in to the ARG comes to mind. Maybe someone else has picked up on something though?</span><br>
I haven’t read the <span class="bbcode-i">Space Odyssey</span> novel series by Arthur C. Clarke, but maybe there could be influences coming from there. For example, on the wikipedia page about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith_(Space_Odyssey)" data-bbcode="true">monoliths</a>, this paragraph in the section describing the origins of the monoliths is particularly interesting:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">As described in Clarke’s novel, the Firstborn discovered later how to transfer their </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness" data-bbcode="true"><span class="bbcode-i">consciousness</span></a><span class="bbcode-i"> onto computers, and thus they became thinking machines. In the end, they surpassed even this achievement, and were able to transfer entirely from physical to non-corporeal forms – the “Lords of the Galaxy” — omniscient, immortal, and capable of travelling at great speeds. The Firstborn had abandoned physical form, but their creations, the monoliths, remained, and these continued to carry out their original assignments.</span></p>
<p>The number of references seen in this ARG is truly amazing. However, some of them may be incidental. We have to keep in mind that the topics touched upon in the story are very common in science fiction literature, movies and games, and there will be linkages and influences going in all directions.</p>
<p>As for figuring out what HALOS is, I think the problem is that there are too few facts in the clues about what it <span class="bbcode-i">is</span>, exactly, and what its purpose is. As a result, there will be too many different theories. One thing seems for sure, though: It appears to have something to do with an artificial intelligence. In any case, I think it’s time we created a page about HALOS on the wiki, so we can start to collate what we <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> know about it.</p>
<p>On the topic of things overlooked, one thing that I feel has been completely overlooked, is the contents of the Code D message (or the Bottomley message). How does that fit into all of this? Was its purpose only to give us the final piece of the number sequence that formed the password to Dr. Horn’s password-protected area, and the rest of the message was just random fluff? Or, does the message hold an important clue about the beginnings of the story, what started it all? Here’s a more readable version of it with punctuation inserted:<br>
[i]It has come to my attention that research into potential alternative bridging methods may be supported by the inclusion and application of the Laser Optronic Linear Inducer Array to act as an axis modulator for regulation and focusing. An unknown energy form was detected whilst investigating this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Please use Code D 0914 to complete the sequence on my site.[/i]<br>
I, for one, am very curious about what this mysterious <span class="bbcode-i">unknown energy form</span> might be. What if this energy form was the signature of some type of lifeform, an <span class="bbcode-i">intelligent</span> lifeform. Something that came from Xen, and lived inside Xen crystals, in other words, a crystalline entity of sorts. If that is the case, then maybe HALOS was designed to be a vessel to harbor this lifeform and harness its powers and abilities. This idea would fit well with this quote from the 1001085139140914/grilledpizza message:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Dr Marcel was right when he said, “When you’re building a cage for Satan, you don’t ask him to wait around whilst you put the doors on.”</span><br>
A thing that goes in favor of this theory, is the fact that in the <a href="https://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Brothers_(episode)" data-bbcode="true">Star Trek TNG s04e03 episode</a>, that was referenced in the <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Monitors#Dr._Sezen.27s_computer_monitor_.28Steam_release.29" data-bbcode="true">Awesumz document</a>, there is a reference to a sinister <a href="https://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Crystalline_Entity" data-bbcode="true"><span class="bbcode-i">crystalline entity</span></a>.</p>
<p>As I am writing this, I am realizing that this theory may be contradicting the idea that we are dealing with an artificial intelligence, as this crystalline entity might not be artificial to begin with. However, by creating a machine that exploited and harnessed the powers and capabilities of this energy form, this lifeform, the end result would be something that might be called artificial.</p>
<p>And there you have it: yet another theory about what HALOS might be…</p>

<p>June 22[sup]nd[/sup], 2013</p>
<p><a href="https://thepizzaisalie.blogspot.com/" data-bbcode="true">https://thepizzaisalie.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>The question exists:<br>
“What <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">is</span></span> the pizza?”</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the      pizza a code word for something else?</li>
<li>Is the      pizza a vehicle for smuggling in a Niobium isotope or derivative?</li>
<li>Why do the      Pizza boxes have the symbols for electronics?</li>
<li>Is the      pizza a cover-up for funding a secret lab within the facility?</li>
<li>Is the      pizza the only food certain aliens can stomach of food from this world, or      the one they prefer?</li>
<li>Is the      pizza a bribe to otherwise cooperative otherworldly creatures not to eat      the lab equipment, or worse, the scientists themselves?</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason we must question the pizza is because things don’t add up.<br>
First, it’s very unusual for any kind of food (other than perhaps food for lab animals) to be included in the budget for a facility. Usually this would be accomplished by allowing spending accounts for employees. Also, according to the overhead announcement in the beginning sequence, because of the nature of substances used in the facility, no food, drink or tobacco is allowed to be consumed within the facility… so pizza is taboo anyway, unless perhaps it’s for the lab experiments…</p>
<p>According to notes on white boards and one of the clues, the pizza was 10% of the budget. This, for a facility the size of Black Mesa, is a significant amount. Likely hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more. This also makes it extremely doubtful that whatever the pizza is, the Administrator Dr. Montero was unaware of it. (In the “lists, lists, lists” message on Welsh’s site, it says that Dr. Montero is the main administrator.)</p>
<p>In the message located at <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Terminal" data-bbcode="true">https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Terminal</a> the author asks us to solve a mystery of <span class="bbcode-i">“unexplained disappearances, misappropriation of funds regarding cheesy oven-baked bread products and an ominous feeling that something is constantly watching this all from the shadows.”</span> Various letters throughout the message are capitalized out of sync, and spell out “DR HORN” implying this mysterious benefactor is our mysterious Dr. Horn (Chris “Stormseeker” Horn) It was Dr. Horn as well who gave us our very first IRC message, which was “The Pizza Is A LIE!” (again, oddly capitalized…)</p>
<p>Later, when Stormseeker PMed one of the game group about a non-ARG-related web site, as an additional clue (which apparently was only found in retrospect, implying we’re really dense,) the capital letters of his entire message spelled out “SECOM” which was the lost cipher type needed for Code D which the group was stuck on at the time. Really? Were we so oblivious he felt we needed that? We <em>must</em> be missing so much… This also implies we <em>really</em> need to watch what Stormseeker says very closely…</p>
<p>Right, pizza.</p>
<p>Also on the “budget” whiteboard, the notes and pie (pizza?) graph on the left details the budget in one, unified handwriting. In the first group of questions under the heading “problem” two of the questions are “What are they hiding?” and “What is the gman telling them?” This leads us to the conclusion that the author of these notes is not privy to the secrets of the others (so not likely Horn, Bottomley, and possibly Junek.) Within the <em>second</em> group of notes written in the same handwriting however is the note “cancel anchovies for pizzas (too many complaints.)” This further implies that the author is also the person who orders the pizzas. Since eating in the facility is forbidden, (and even if people are ignoring the restriction,) who is complaining?</p>
<p>So far, the clues and notes <em>do</em> seem to point to the idea that the pizza is intended as just that - pizza. It’s not a code for something else, and the various boxes of pizza all over the facility seem to back this theory up. WHOSE pizza it is however has not been established. Dr. Welsh’s journal says “I got a call from Dr Stone over in Sector C, and he thinks Dr Horn has been misappropriating funds from the lab budget to buy pizzas with, and fund some secret project we don’t have the access levels to get at…We have a plan though to get back at Dr Horn, we’re going to steal all his misgotten goods, and hide them throughout the whole facility, he’ll spend months looking for them.” The term “misbegotten goods” does not directly specify the pizzas, but since we’re finding them throughout the whole facility, it’s a reasonable connection. Although it brings up the question of the electronics symbols on the pizza boxes. Perhaps the pizzas are being used to smuggle something <em>else</em> in, and by hiding the pizzas, the electronics - Dr. Horn’s “misbegotten goods” - are being hidden as well…</p>
<p>We must also recognize Dr. Stone <em>EXISTS</em> and is ALIVE in Sector C (or was as of September 10th)… He is also the originator of the idea that Dr. Horn is misappropriating funds, and the secret project and the pizzas were equally implicated. Yet Dr. Horn himself mentions baked goods with cheese and asks us to solve this mystery. Again, this doesn’t make sense - why ask people to discover your secrets? In addition, if the pizzas are budgeted in (10% no less!) how much more would you need to misappropriate? Must be one big damn project, or a LOT of pizzas!!</p>
<p>Perhaps Doctors Horn and Bottomly have opened up a Pizza venue on Xen and are using the transport device in the secret lab to deliver them to their Xenian customers? LOL  If so, it appears the Xenians don’t like anchovies any more than I do. They may, however, like it “grilled.” <em>evil grin</em><br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">New Life</span></p>
<p>Hi all…<br>
My name is Gameblossom, and I spent three days last month reading from post 1 to now…my hubby and son thought I was nuts. I’ve tossed Guns a couple of PMs but now that my posting has been approved, I wanted to say hi and share some of what I’ve got so far.</p>
<p>Most of my insights come from what <em>I’d</em> say is an outside perspective - my 23 year old son James is the half-life player, not me. I tried to get him interested in BM and the ARG, cause he really likes these kinds things, but so far he’s pretty absorbed in other RL things, he just got a new job and a fairly new GF. But since I’ve never played HL/HL2, I keep having to ask him questions. I finally installed Steam and BM after I had asked him about the 45th question, and he grumbled at me “Why don’t you just load it and play it?” (Of course then he had to show me the keyboard mechanics, I’m WAY too used to Blizzard games and keep trying to walk with my mouse instead of the WASD keys. I’ve made it to outside though!)</p>
<p>Anyway, like I said, I kinda think most of my perspective as a non-player gives me a little objectiveness, and hopefully some insight. I’ve been slowly trying to write my thoughts and ideas (as they are SO-FAR - by NO means am I complete with all my hand-scribbled notes yet! LOL) I’ll also be adding my notes as I go, and I’m not saying any of it is going to be terrably organized - I have Adult ADHD, so my brain doesn’t always whiz by in the most organized fashion…lol</p>
<p>Anyway… As I decipher my own notes, some things <span class="bbcode-u">didn’t add up…</span><br>
(And a side note - the wiki says P. Bottomley is Administrator, but according to the “lists” journal note found on Welsh’s resume image, Dr. Montero is the main administrator…not Bottomley.</p>
<p>The whiteboard with the note about J.D. Marcel says “Paul - can you call Dr. JD Marcel on ext 1187.463 about the niobium 5 <em><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">HE</span></span></em> needs for that AI project ‘thing’ - Dr. Montero” (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>This says to me that <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">Dr. Marcel</span></span> is the one building an AI ‘thing’ (<span class="bbcode-b">not</span> anyone at the BM facility,) which research into the TV show Bugs shows is correct, i.e. Cyberax…<span class="bbcode-u">NOT Dr. Bottomly OR Dr. Horn…</span> The second part of this season’s cliffhanger was called “A Cage for Satan” which I believe is where the quote is from. However… <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">is it possible that the docs of the BM secret project traded N5 for JD Marcel’s technology, and are using it on aliens in the secret labs in X01 and X02, controlling them?</span></span> I haven’t seen the show, so I don’t know what cyberax did to people…</p>
<p>Next, the extension of “1184.463” left for JD Marcel does not look like any extension I’ve <em>ever</em> seen in any phone system… it DOES look like something <span class="bbcode-u">computer related</span> though, although I can’t think what off the top of my head. It could also possibly be part of a Lat/Lon location, but finding where the divisions are might require a bit of sleuthing - although we have another L/L where we’re told the N5 has been moved to - <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">something we REALLY need to look more into…</span></span></p>
<p>Next, on the “budget” whiteboard, there are some questions written <span class="bbcode-u">all in the same handwriting.</span> Two things stick out. One, the person <span class="bbcode-u">writing</span> is asking <span class="bbcode-i">what is being hidden</span>, and what the gman is telling “them” (whoever “them” is.) Two, farther down, a note (to himself?) to cancel anchovies on the pizza because of complaints. This <span class="bbcode-i">implies</span> that the <span class="bbcode-u">person who is questioning the funding is also ordering the pizzas!!</span> And complaints by whom, since this person is obviously not freely sharing with the guards and most others? Another thing we keep forgetting to take into consideration is our character, Dr. Gordon Freeman - one of the three people who established the facility, was in on the goings-on in the lab - we may find WE are the villain and just don’t remember it! And why were WE the one that got sent into that chamber instead of some lower-paid lacky? None of the other primary players were doing grunt work… was someone trying to kill US?</p>
<p>The message on stormseeker’s site (terminal page) says:<br>
“I have long suspected that there was something stRange going on during the development of this facility. The unexplained disappearances, misappropriation of funds regarding cheesy oven-baked bread products and an ominous feeling that something is constantly watching this all from the shadows, Have added up to create something that needs solving, and sOlving fast”</p>
<p>If we run under the idea this is Dr. Horn (reasonable,) it <span class="bbcode-i">almost</span> seems as if Dr. Horn is not ordering them the deaths nor the pizzas, although this contradicts other evidence. But then who is? And what unexplained disappearances? Dr. Stone? Are we instead looking for Dr. Stone or his killer? What would be Dr. Horn’s motivation for offering <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">a reward</span></span> to those who compromised the security and knowledge of his secret lab(s)? It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Another thing - Stormseeker (we assume, which is <span class="bbcode-b">bad,</span>) originally popped into the IRC room as <span class="bbcode-u">“Dr. Horn”</span> then popped out. Ever since then, it has NOT been Dr. Horn, but <span class="bbcode-u">“Watcher”</span> who we <span class="bbcode-b">CAN NOT CONFIRM is Dr. Horn!</span> Given the kind of subterfuge we’ve seen from Stormseeker and his co-horts so far, I seriously suggest this is for<span class="bbcode-u"> a definite reason</span> - it’s just too obvious.</p>
<p>Someone had found a “lego man” and then later there was a comment about needing a 32-bit code -which made me think of old 32-bit graphics…like perhaps a minecraft-looking “lego man.” I think someone should decompile/look more at the graphic of the lego man if someone can find it. Just seemed of note.</p>
<p>Something I think we ALL need to remember about the IRC codes - once the code is <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">decoded</span></span> all the information contained within it is suspect, even the IP addresses, seemingly machine codes, and anything else. The coded part may <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">look</span></span> like normal messages, but it’s <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">constructed</span></span> to look that way by Stormseeker and his friends, and would be very easy to overlook something staring us in the face.</p>
<p>In IRC message 2, we again see the <span class="bbcode-u">“<a href="http://dslgb.com/">dslgb.com</a>”</span> but this time it’s from .177 instead of .164 - Watcher gives us the code three times before, then says ‘ignore IRC error - incoming message.’ Then all the same codes as before plus one grouping of code, says “add” and “end message” and logs out. Was the “ignore IRC error” meant as a sincere drop in character, or a red herring? What does “add” mean? To add all the lines together? (And I know the final outcome was the 4 Lat/Lon codes. There’s way more to those too!!)</p>
<p>I think we’re missing a <span class="bbcode-u">LOT of obvious things</span>. It’s got to be driving Stormseeker NUTS, as we’re probably looking in these obscure, harder-than-they-have-to-be places and missing what’s right in front of our faces. This is even more emphasized by him saying someone is close, and we’re still sitting here looking like cocker spaniels in front of a speeding car asking “what’s runned over?”</p>

<p>We know what the cake is, we have an idea of the Pizza, wonder what the bucket of chicken is about? And The Location??? I’ve noticed pictures of Airstrips all over the place, not the least of which is the ones in the secret shack. And did anyone notice that backwards in the window of the secret shack in the layer-removed version it says “secret code” or something like that? (I tried to find the pics again, but couldn’t.) I really <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">really</span></span> think we need to look at the taco shack more. One of the uses of Niobium (which as also called “mithril” by the way…) is in making pipes, and there’s a invoice on the board in the taco shack and from what I could see it looked like a very large shipment of pipes… a covert way of getting a Niobium supply?</p>
<p>OK, those are it right now… but I felt they were important based on the running assumptions of the group at this point. They put serious kinks in our reasoning, and means we re-evaluate some assumptions… of which re-reading the forums, there are a LOT of…</p>

<p>There is a long-standing that Niobium was being smuggled in on pizzas and used to build an AI called HALOS. While this would explain the large portion of the budget being spent on pizza, it doesn’t explain why the Niobium was being smuggled in the first place. The use of Niobium in the construction of an AI is established in whiteboard c0a1x_labboard_am1. However, from the same whiteboard, it can be inferred that Dr. Montero, often noted as an administrator, was aware that Dr. Bottomley was in possession of Niobium. Why, then, were measures being taken to smuggle it in?<br>
My theory is that the Niobium was initially being used in the development of the Tau Cannon. After all, the usage of Nb alloys as a superconductor is often linked to its use in particle accelerators. This would explain why Dr. Montero was aware of its presence in the Biodome. However, if Nb can also be used in an AI, and Dr. Horn and Dr. Bottomley were secretly using for this purpose, they would need a way to smuggle in additional Nb so as to avoid detection. This is why they used pizzas. A stockpile of pizzas, while strange, would seem much more innocent than a stockpile–or worse, unexplained disappearances–of an element often used in jet engines (see C-103 alloy) and currently being used in the Tau Cannon, the destructive power of which we are all familiar with.<br>
This theory doesn’t replace the long-standing one, but rather acts to fill on some of the gaps, and make use of the clues which have been provided.</p>
<p>Second, understanding the significance of the pizzas, what is the implication of their theft by Dr. Stone and Dr. Welsh? Whiteboard c2a4x_labboard1 already shows Dr. Horn’s frustration regarding one of the security guards taking and eating the pizzas. This is understandable, because it would mean that more pizzas would have to be ordered to replace the Niobium. But consider what would happen if someone made a concentrated effort to steal and hide as many pizzas as possible. Recall that the events of Half-Life 1 take place in May, while the diary entry from Dr. Welsh mentioning the plan to steal the pizzas is dated in either September or October, depending on what format was used for the date. Since we are still able to find countless pizzas scattered throughout the facility, and the large contribution of pizza orders to the Biodome budget, as well as their continued theft (see whiteboard c2a4x_labboard15). is still being seen as an issue, it would appear that this has been going on for several months–almost a year, in fact.</p>
<p>If something about the previous statement seems strange, that is because it should. According to the evidence presented above, Dr. Horn had been continuing to smuggle in Niobium using pizzas right up to the events of HL1. However, this seems to contradict IRC clues 2 and 3, which points to the recovery of Niobium at Holloman Air Force Base, and the subsequent continuation of project HALOS thereafter. I have several theories regarding this, but they are mostly speculation.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">March 15[sup]th[/sup], 2015</span></p>
<p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/13735-ARG-The-Pizza-Code-Mystery/?postID=603538#post603538" data-bbcode="true">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/13735-ARG-The-Pizza-Code-Mystery/?postID=603538#post603538</a></p>
<p>What if the intent of the appearance of test pattern was simply to lead us to reexamine that line from the HALOS file?</p>
<p>In context, it appears after the queries for user activation and passcode. In other words, where someone would logically use the login credentials from IRCs 4 and 5. This would mean somebody reactivated the “site.” Perhaps, the test pattern was a literal “test” of the “pattern,” like testing a program. In other words, it was a test of the HALOS system.</p>
<p>We’ve always thought of HALOS as a mysterious, silent observer, waiting maliciously in the shadows. But we are ignoring the clues regarding the AIs original purpose. The use of Niobium, and the label on the doors to the X01 and X02 labs, “Macroscale Quantum Systems,” suggest HALOS was intended to be a quantum computer.</p>
<p>Within all this emphasis on ciphers, and a test pattern that involved encrypted data, I would suppose HALOS was meant to be a code breaker. Then, the hex code was its final test.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to make of this theory, but maybe we need to start asking questions like who reactivated HALOS and why? More importantly, were they testing HALOS’s functionality, and did it work? Lastly, if it was a test, with a known plaintext, what might the tester use, either for the key or the plaintext?</p>
<p>EDIT: One more thought. If HALOS is indeed a quantum computer, designed to break most modern encryptions in a reasonable amount of time, try combining this with the other portrayal of the AI, that of the observer, the analyzer. Traffic analysis, timing attacks, asymmetric cryptosystems like Benaloh and Paillier, and cascade ciphers. If someone were designing the ultimate code breaker, I would imagine they would test it against the ultimate code. “Tempus Omnia Revelant,” initials TOR. The Onion Router, named for its multilayered encryption, and considered the holy grail of encrypted communication.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree with efforts to clarify the story. <span class="bbcode-b">Storm keeps suggesting that would help us.</span> And, considering this is the guy who expanded the QE chapter to being on of the highlights of the Black Mesa mod, and <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Questionable_Ethics#Redesign_History" data-bbcode="true">showed his work</a>, I’m disinclined to leave gaping plot holes or write off several pieces of the story as just outside references.</p>
<p>J.D. Marcel, for example, may not be just a reference to a 90s BCC show, but also a researcher at Black Mesa who wanted to get in touch with Bottomley, administrator of the Biodome labs, in order to get Niobium for an AI project. I made a post about this a few weeks ago. From this interpretation, I was concluded that Niobium was already in use at the Biodome, probably as a superconductor for use in particle accelerators like the tau cannon. It also has other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium#Applications" data-bbcode="true">applications</a> that might make it suit the needs of Lab D Optronics. This was also how I was able to establish a stronger connection between Niobium and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing#Developments" data-bbcode="true">quantum computer</a>, rather than a standard issue sci-fi supercomputer.</p>
<p>I concluded that Horn and Bottomley were smuggling additional Niobium into the Biodome to work on a computer to house the HALOS AI. To avoid questions regarding why they needed so much Niobium, they hid their actions using pizza. Hence, “the pizza is a lie.” Either they bought Niobium and wrote of the expenses as pizza orders, or they literally smuggled the Niobium in with the pizzas. I’m inclined to go with the latter theory, silly as it is. It would help rationalize Horn’s anger over any theft or unauthorized consumption of the pizza. It also matches <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Dr_J._Welsh" data-bbcode="true">Welsh’s diary entry</a> with the theft mentioned on the budget whiteboard, which was attributed to Dr. Stone, and the text below the grilled pizza image on <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Stormseeker%27s_Website" data-bbcode="true">Storm’s website</a>.</p>
<p>My remaining questions are about what happened next.</p>
<p>Who are “they” from the grilled pizza text? What exactly did they steal, and where are they hiding? <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/IRC_clue_1" data-bbcode="true">IRC Clue 1</a> points at it being Welsh, but the message could be interpreted as them asking Horn to not let some other entity find them.</p>
<p>Who was behind the acquisition of Niobium and the continuation of the HALOS project mentioned carried out in the other IRC clues? What was the result of their efforts?</p>
<p>How did Horn go from the vengeful man who wrote the grilled pizza highlight text to the man who wrote the <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Tempus_omnia_revelant" data-bbcode="true">Tempus omnia revelant</a>, with the hidden message that seemed to warn us about an AI that is watching us?</p>
<p>I also can’t shake the feeling that our progress in the ARG is a driving point of the story, since HALOS.txt only appeared after possible login credentials were found in<a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/IRC_clue_5" data-bbcode="true">IRC Clue 5</a>, and possibly 4. Also, <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/IRC_clue_4" data-bbcode="true">Clue 4</a>, which came out right after the /thepizzaisalie extension was accessed, mentions an access being detected to a personal site.</p>
<p>Also, on that note, who might have put HALOS.txt there, and possibly reactivated the AI?</p>
<p>Any thoughts?<br>

<p>I’m glad you brought up the members of the staff, because it closely relates to that theory I’ve been working on. I’m still hammering out the details, so I would greatly appreciate your input. And please, try and bare with me. As a general rule, please reference <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/SearchResult/64356/?highlight=" data-bbcode="true">posts by 0418_08151814</a>, as well as any relevant pages on the wiki as necessary in order to better understand this theory.</p>
<p>The current, widely accepted theory places Dr. Horn (and Bottomley) on one side, and Dr.s Welsh and Stone on the other. Supposedly, Horn was working on a superconductor based supercomputer, probably of the quantum variety. Welsh and Stone made off the absurd the amount of pizza Horn had been ordering, and which was somehow connected to the project. Now, Welsh and Stone are supposedly in hiding, being pursued by Horn.</p>
<p>While the above theory has its merits, it falls short on a few key details. Namely, our own involvement in this mystery. The text of Code A informs the reader that four codes have been hidden. Together, these codes grant access to a site. The message also advises the reader to “Do Konami,” of course, the original message had a typo in it. Following the hint to “Do Konami” led us to <a href="https://terminal.blackmesasource.com/" data-bbcode="true">this.</a> As has been noted before, the improperly capitalized letters spell out “DR HORN,” implying this too is a message from him. The “To: Bottomley; From: Horn” implied by the underlining of the names near Code D in-game, matching the format used on other whiteboard notes, further implies that it was Horn setting up these clues. Lastly the above site encourages the reader to continue investigating the mystery.</p>
<p>The problem is rather clear if you try turning the chessboard around. Based on the clues presented–or rather, the fact that they exist and were set up by Horn–it doesn’t make any sense for Horn to be behind this. Rather, Horn seems to be on our side, providing us with cryptic–often encrypted clues–to point us in the right direction, as well as tell us what he knows. Were he the primary antagonist, this would be the equivalent of sealing his own demise, since anyone in the Biodome could have found these clues, accessed the site, and found grilledpizza.jpg and its associated text. The same inconsistency is present for the TOR page, which–despite drawing from other sources–was created and placed on the wiki by Dr Horn. <span class="bbcode-b">Based on this, I conclude that Dr. Horn is on our side, to the extent that he wants this mystery solved in some form.</span></p>
<p>This is just the starting point of this theory, so please look this over for now. The next portion involves the IRC Clues, which Storm (as 0418) implied were story related and did not contain hints to solve any ciphers–most likely including HALOS.txt</p>
<p>Let’s now take a look at the IRC Clues. They key questions around these are not only what the message is, but who sent it and why. It has been theorized that messages originally appearing on the IRC may be intercepts, or otherwise forwarded versions of previous messages. Thus, there may exist multiple sets of senders and receivers.</p>
<p>The first is a garbled message correcting the error in Code A, as well as including “Dr. Bon Ami is not Ami,” and “Dr. Horn Don’t let him find us Dr. Welsh,” phrases of dubious punctuation, phrasing, and ultimately unclear intent.</p>
<p>Setting aside the possible interpretations, let’s turn to IRC Clue 2. This is written in the form of the ending of K2 from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos#Solution_of_passage_2" data-bbcode="true">Kryptos</a>statue, making use of very similar coordinates on the first line. Combining this with IRC Clue 3, this appears to be part of a story regarding the transfer of Niobium via Holloman Air Force Base to a primary site, after which project HALOS was stated to be underway. However, Clue 2 also includes a message given by unusual capitalization. “NOTE WELSH,” probably referring to Welsh’s diary entry, connecting him and Dr. Stone to the theft of Horn’s “misgotten goods.” [sic]</p>
<p>What I find particularly interesting regarding Welsh’s note is the file-name of the image. Decode the binary, it gives evidence that Dr. Welsh was aware that “the pizza is a lie.” Only Welsh, Horn (from the IRC) and the sender of IRC Clue 6 are believed to know of this phrase with sufficient knowledge of its underlying meaning.</p>
<p>Here’s where things get technical. Normally, a proper mystery would avoid hard science, but, in light of the setting, I believe an exception is justified in this case.<br>
(Warning: long, sciencey stuff ahead)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing" data-bbcode="true">After</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect" data-bbcode="true">extensive</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_quantum_computing" data-bbcode="true">research</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-II_superconductor" data-bbcode="true">on the</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium#Superconducting_magnets" data-bbcode="true">material</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_optical_quantum_computing" data-bbcode="true">referenced</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_quantum_computer" data-bbcode="true">by the whiteboards,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_quantum_computer" data-bbcode="true">as well as</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography" data-bbcode="true">general information</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" data-bbcode="true">regarding</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" data-bbcode="true">quantum computing</a>, trying to link things to what appears on the whiteboards, I have reached a stunning conclusion.</p>
<p>There are, in fact, two sectors at the Black Mesa Research Facility visited over the course of Freeman’s journey that lend themselves to achieving quantum computing through a variety of means.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Sector_E_Biodome_Complex" data-bbcode="true">Sector E</a>, which features cryogenics labs in both Biodome Lab B and the lower levels visited in Apprehension, thus offering temperatures low enough for superconducting quantum computers. Sector E is also home to the laser optronics Lab D, which lends itself to quantum computing using a different mechanism. (There is also the nano-fabrication labs in Lab C, but we never got to see it)</p>
<p>The second is <a href="https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Sector_C_Test_Labs" data-bbcode="true">Sector C</a>, which also contains some cryogenics areas (probably related to the Supercooled Laser Laboratory) as well as enough spectroscopy equipment to detect all sorts of quantum phenomena. This equipment would also likely contain some superconductors as well, It might even be capable of detecting isotopes of a certain element that may or may not be hidden in the vicinity of a pizza box, but I fear I might be getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>There are a few elements linking these two locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both      Sectors actively received specimens taken from Xen by the Lambda Team</li>
<li>The staff      personnel often stayed in contact with each other, with phone extensions      written out on whiteboards<br>
For now, let’s focus on the second point. As some may have noticed, there is a certain member of the Sector C staff who has significant ties to Sector E. Dr. Anthony Stone, who’s name appears on a locker in Sector C, was also one of the founders of the Biolabs, along with Horn, Welsh, and Foreman. (I understand they built the map IRL, but try and think of things in terms of the story)</li>
</ul>
<p>These pieces of information, in light of Welsh’s diary entry, give way to some very strange theories.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">March 20[sup]th[/sup], 2015</span></p>
<p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/13735-ARG-The-Pizza-Code-Mystery/?postID=604925#post604925" data-bbcode="true">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/13735-ARG-The-Pizza-Code-Mystery/?postID=604925#post604925</a></p>
<p>Superconductors aren’t the only way to build a quantum computer. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_optical_quantum_computing" data-bbcode="true">Optics work just as well.</a>Which begs the question, why would Dr. Horn go to such great, and admittedly rather silly, lengths to build a supercomputer on way when he was literally just a few feet away from a stockpile of materials to build one another way? And judging by his assumed friendship with Bottomley, the Biolabs administrator, and how he seems to throw his weight around in the note from Welsh’s diary, I don’t think he would have any trouble using such equipment for a secret project.</p>
<p>We may have made a slight miscalculation in our story theories thus far. I’ve got some theories, but I’m still trying to formalize them.</p>

<p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/56302-JohnNotJohn/" data-bbcode="true">@JohnNotJohn</a> - <span class="bbcode-i">I’m not going to quote that whole thing (there’s enough scrolling as it is), but there’s one thing I’d like to point out: the idea that Dr. Horn is asking for our help in solving these mysteries does not mean he is on our side, per se. He might just be using us instead. He seems rather… focussed? Determined? </span><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Obsessed?</span></span>[i]</p>
<p>In fact… if I understand the story so far correctly, I think we might have to pick a side. Do we help Dr. Horn with taking revenge on Dr. Welsh and Dr. Stone and progress on his HALOS project, or do we help Welsh and Stone (and others?) in getting out of there safely? Those two sides seem rather conflicted. If we help decrypting messages with HALOS, we undermine the safety of Welsh and Stone. If we help those two get out, they might be able to stop Dr. Horn / HALOS from a safe place.[/i]<br>
The problem is I don’t know if this understanding of the story is correct. This theory of a deranged Dr. Horn pursuing Welsh and Stone has been around for years, and yet Storm kept hinting at looking into the story, seemingly suggesting things we already knew. That’s why I’m looking into all these points: to see if we made a mistake somewhere.</p>
<p>The “ominous feeling that something is constantly watching this all from the shadows,” and the tone of a great deal of the TOR page makes me think that not only is HALOS already online, but Horn himself is afraid of it.</p>
<p>Earlier, when you bought up that article about the impact quantum computing would have on cryptography, it occurred to me that the ciphers that have been used tend to be those more-resistant to being cracked by a quantum computer. This leads me to believe that the person sending the messages is already aware of HALOS, and fears what it is capable of. This was right after I had done all that research about potential technologies behind quantum computing.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve had this strange theory in my head that there is another explanation.</p>
<p>Originally, when we accessed what I assume to be Dr. Horn’s site, we found that message with grilledpizza.jpg where he believes Welsh is behind everything. Later, a month after the discovery of HALOS.txt, the Tempus Omnia page appears on the wiki, with the Lies.jpg mentioning Dr Stone. Since photos of Horn, Welsh, and Foreman appear in QE, and Bottomley seems to have been executed by the HECU once Freeman arrives, I would have to guess that Stone is the one in the picture. This means that at some point, Horn turned his attention from Welsh to Stone.</p>
<p>That is when I remembered the strange phrasing of IRC Clue 1: “Dr. Horn Don’t let him find us Dr. Welsh”</p>
<p>That could be interpreted as Dr. Welsh telling Dr. Horn not to let someone find them. In other words, Horn and Welsh could be on the same side.</p>
<p>Consider this: Welsh went along with Stone, believing they were playing a prank on Dr. Horn by stealing his pizzas. But in actuality, Stone was stealing the Niobium to use for himself. To use the image from the Tempus Omnia page, Pizza : Niobium : : “Steals it; eats it” : “Steals it; uses it”<br>
Stone stole not only the niobium from the pizzas, but HALOS as well, and then set about acquiring a large amount of Niobium in secret, trying to complete HALOS. This is what happened in IRCs 2 and 3. It’s possible that Dr. Junek could have been in on it, granting them access to the classified labs.<br>
Ultimately, Stone succeeded to some extent, and HALOS was brought online.</p>
<p>Then, Welsh figured out what was going on and tried to warn Horn. Perhaps he was the leaker mentioned in IRC 3. He either purposefully or unintentionally compromised the security of Stone’s HALOS computer, activating its automated function to send a warning message to Dr. Horn. This is what happened in IRC 5.</p>
<p>I know it’s a crazy theory, but sometimes we need crazy theories. They make for better stories.</p>
<p>EDIT: It’s almost like you half-ninja’d me at the last second.</p>

<p>As for story, while I still believe the websites and terminals are for a later part of the ARG (“<a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/BMRF.us" data-bbcode="true">This unlocks at the start of the end</a>”), at least some the <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/KXBM.net" data-bbcode="true">Base64 filenames</a> (and morse) seem to be storyline clues. Perhaps to push us back on track. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fat lot of      good that Ph.D does me now</li>
<li>I’ve been      waiting here for ages, hoping someone would come along!</li>
<li>Get us out      of here before those military drones find out where we’re hiding</li>
<li><span class="bbcode-b">        DE AI5BM AI5BM AI5BM BLACK MESA RESEARCH FACILITY      BIODOME LABS. TRAPPED, NEED RESCUE. EVAC ZONE NOT SAFE. MILITARY HOSTILE       K</span></li>
<li>I can see      you already know a great deal more than any one man is supposed to.</li>
<li>The      science team has been tracking your progress with the Black Mesa security      system. Unfortunately, so is the military.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, note: “where <span class="bbcode-u">we</span>’re hiding”, suggesting there’s multiple people (or entities), but also “<span class="bbcode-u">I</span>’ve been waiting” which suggests there’s only one person. The morse code’s specification of “biodome labs” suggests that’s where they’re hiding. Unless the morse code was not <span class="bbcode-b">sent</span> by whoever wrote the other messages, but <span class="bbcode-b">received</span>: remember, the source has a message saying “Get away from there, Freeman! I’m expecting an important message” (not in Base64, though). In that case, we don’t know where the source of the other messages is, nor who sent the morse code.</p>
<p>Additionally, “Fat lot of good that Ph.D does <span class="bbcode-u">me</span> now” reminds me of a screenshot I came across. The portrait of Dr. C. Horn on the wiki main page is found in-game next to his framed degree, correct? I bet he’s not the only researcher there with a Ph.D, but it might be a hint. If it really is him, it suggests Dr. Horn is one of the people hiding out in the biodome labs.</p>
<p>Also note that the first and third of the quotes I mentioned above are apparently the only two without a . (or ? / !) at the end out of all the Base64 names. I checked a few and it seems this was not just a wiki editing error. It might be nothing, or perhaps it suggests they’re written by someone other than whoever (whatever?) wrote the other messages.</p>
<p>The line about knowing “more than any one man is supposed to” seems meaningful, somehow. You’d think for someone in dire need of help, and seemingly asking him for help, knowing more about the situation would be a good thing. This message doesn’t sound like whoever wrote is it all too happy with it, though.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the last line above (about the science team and military both tracking progress) reminds me of the “<a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Tempus_omnia_revelant" data-bbcode="true">something is constantly watching this all from the shadows</a>” line. You’d think both the science and military would be addressed with “someone” rather than “something” though, so I’m not sure what to make of this.</p>
<p>So yeah. In short: I’m trying to push this whole storyline thing because it seemed to have been important once (over 2 years ago) and never seemed to have led anywhere. That makes me believe it’s still on our to-do list. On the other hand, I hope all these old hints from Storm are not outdated and he’s gone off into an entirely different direction, because we got too stuck and made no progress, or whatever (after all, the websites seem to have been “unlocked”, in a way?). In that case: I’m sorry? =3<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">I, for one, am very curious about what this mysterious unknown energy form might be. What if this energy form was the signature of some type of lifeform, an intelligent lifeform. Something that came from Xen, and lived inside Xen crystals, in other words, a crystalline entity of sorts. If that is the case, then maybe HALOS was designed to be a vessel to harbor this lifeform and harness its powers and abilities. This idea would fit well with this quote from the 1001085139140914/grilledpizza message: </span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Dr Marcel was right when he said, “When you’re building a cage for Satan, you don’t ask him to wait around whilst you put the doors on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">A thing that goes in favor of this theory, is the fact that in the </span><a href="https://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Brothers_(episode)" data-bbcode="true"><span class="bbcode-i">Star Trek TNG s04e03 episode</span></a><span class="bbcode-i">, that was referenced in the </span><a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Monitors#Dr._Sezen.27s_computer_monitor_.28Steam_release.29" data-bbcode="true"><span class="bbcode-i">Awesumz document</span></a><span class="bbcode-i">, there is a reference to a sinister </span><a href="https://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Crystalline_Entity" data-bbcode="true"><span class="bbcode-i">crystalline entity</span></a>[i].<br>
As I am writing this, I am realizing that this theory may be contradicting the idea that we are dealing with an artificial intelligence, as this crystalline entity might not be artificial to begin with. However, by creating a machine that exploited and harnessed the powers and capabilities of this energy form, this lifeform, the end result would be something that might be called artificial.</p>
<p>And there you have it: yet another theory about what HALOS might be…[/i]</p>
<p>Just spitballing here, but between this post and the works of Adam Foster, I’m starting to think that maybe HALOS isn’t technically the entity itself - maybe it was designed to be a computer system, but ended up being some sort of container for an energy-based intelligence, whether by design or purely by accident.</p>
<p>So, it’s not an <span class="bbcode-i">artificial </span>intelligence, so much as an artificial body for an<span class="bbcode-b"> existing natural</span> intelligence. Could be the LOLIA’s “bridging” experiment caused this being to be sucked from another dimension to ours, and then into the monitoring equipment or something.</p>
<p>Or perhaps HALOS actually contains the consciousness of Dr. Horn, and all these strange messages are his way of trying to draw attention to his plight.</p>

          <p>This personal story line creation is due, in large part, to those who have contributed their thoughts previously.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Niobium thoughts:</span></p>
<p>We know that niobium is used in the creation of quantum computers and that Dr Horn was sneaking it in but why? He should be able to order as much as he needed for “that AI thing” If Dr. Horn actually needed Niobium for the TAU cannon then there’s no reason he couldn’t have ordered it for that project too. Why then is he sneaking Niobium into the facility?</p>
<p>Black Mesa’s incident took place in 2006. This is determined by the December calendars throughout the game showing the dates. Sunday, December 3[sup]rd[/sup] only occurred in 2000 and in 2006. A poster appearing in the Taco shack is dated 2006. Why is that important? Well it seems that there was a <span class="bbcode-u">dramatic</span> price hike in the commodities market in that decade and that the largest percentage spike occurred in 2006. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_commodities_boom" data-bbcode="true">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_commodities_boom</a></p>
<p>Niobium isn’t an expensive item. Today it sells for around $20 a pound. So, placing orders for Niobium wouldn’t have been a large expense. So why would Dr. Horn sneak Niobium into BM? Throughout the year(s) he’s ordered Niobium and all of a sudden he starts noticing that every time he orders it he is having to pay substantially more than the last time, even if it’s only been a few days! When he asks his supplier, he’s told that there’s a significant price spike in the commodities market and pricing is escalating dramatically, almost daily. This gives Dr. Horn a great idea. What if he sneaks Niobium in, has BM pay for it and then he resells it himself making tons of money by doing so? Now, where could he possibly sell it? Well, guess what? Holloman Air Force Base, in actuality, is a buyer and seller of metal commodities, including Niobium! <a href="https://scrapmetalpricesperpound.com/scrap-copper-prices-per-pound-in-city-holloman-air-force-base" data-bbcode="true">https://scrapmetalpricesperpound.com/scrap-copper-prices-per-pound-in-city-holloman-air-force-base</a>  He can make a fortune and no one would be wiser. This would also account for the TERMINAL message <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Terminal" data-bbcode="true">https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Terminal</a> where it talks about the <span class="bbcode-i">misappropriation of funds regarding cheesy oven-baked bread products.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Pizza Thoughts:</span></p>
<p>Dr. Horn would place his “order” for pizzas and the Niobium would be sneaked in as the round disc that the pizza rests on inside the box. He would allocate the expense on his budget by listing part of the expense as pizzas and part under his ‘Lab D’ expenses.Hence, the reason why the Lab D budget has reached ‘unacceptable’ levels as indicated on the whiteboard. <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Whiteboards?file=C2a4x_labboard15.jpg" data-bbcode="true">https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Whiteboards?file=C2a4x_labboard15.jpg</a></p>
<p>Now, why is there such a huge increase in pizza expenses?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">HALOS thoughts:</span></p>
<p>We know that Dr. Horn was working on ‘that AI thing’ and that Niobium was being used in its development. Niobium is a necessary ingredient for construction of Quantum Computers. So, we can assume that he was actually developing a Quantum Computer AI. He now begins testing this new creation by giving it a simple task, ordering pizzas. It’s a simple task that, unforeseen by him, results in his creation becoming a Paperclip Maximizer <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer" data-bbcode="true">https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer</a> as initially mentioned by user quatrro <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/13735-ARG-The-Pizza-Code-Mystery/?postID=538400&amp;highlight=paperclip#post538400" data-bbcode="true">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/13735-ARG-The-Pizza-Code-Mystery/?postID=538400&amp;highlight=paperclip#post538400</a></p>
<p>The AI continues ordering more and more pizzas, because more and more pizzas are ending up missing. The AI is simply doing its job. Unfortunately, it’s gone into Paperclip mode! The orders have grown so large that the budget pie chart now actually has pizzas listed as an expense! <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Whiteboards?file=C2a4x_labboard15.jpg" data-bbcode="true">https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Whiteboards?file=C2a4x_labboard15.jpg</a></p>
<p>The AI has gone out of control and Dr. Horn can’t stop it.</p>
<p>Once the resonance cascade begins, Dr. Horn turns to yet another Aperture Science stolen creation. He either finds Dr. Bottomley shot in his office or he shoots him himself in order to plant his personality core into his AI creation and hopefully, regain control of it.  His Quantum Computer AI has now become HALOS, Black Mesa’s equivalent of GLADos . Aperture Science implanted Caroline’s personality core into their AI and Dr. Horn has implanted Dr. Bottomley’s personality core into his quantum computer.This is his ‘cage for satan’ <a href="https://www.thestormseeker.com/thepizzaisalie/1001085139140914.html" data-bbcode="true">https://www.thestormseeker.com/thepizzaisalie/1001085139140914.html</a></p>
<p>Remember  Bottomley’s post? <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/13735-ARG-The-Pizza-Code-Mystery/?postID=506172#post506172" data-bbcode="true">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/13735-ARG-The-Pizza-Code-Mystery/?postID=506172#post506172</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“I’m Paul Bottomley (for my sins in a past life, no doubt), a friend of Chris’s and was once shot in the head for science. I was planning to create some kind of short story about how “I” survived the BM incident through the clever use of cloning. It wouldn’t have been related in any meaningful way to Stormseeker’s magnum opus” </span></p>
<p>He ‘was shot in the head for science’. He survived the BM incident through the clever use of cloning and notice when he uses the word ‘I’ that it’s in quotation marks. Why would he do that? Is it because he is no longer the Bottomley “I” but rather the HALOS “I”?</p>

          <p>You see, I think it’s different. I think HALOS is simply an AI Dr. Horn was trying to create, but when the resonance cascade happened, Dr. Horn was forced to escape the facility. Now that the Resonance Cascade has passed, he’s been trying to regain control and transfer HALOS over to a different site. The IRC Clues were part of the transmissions meant to do such a thing, most likely being leftovers from transmitting the entire computer system over. The current HALOS Code / 752 hex code is a part of that as well. Since Dr. Horn probably doesn’t have the tools to decode these transmissions so easily, that’s why he wants us to decode them.</p>
