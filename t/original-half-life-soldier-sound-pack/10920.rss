    <title>Original Half-Life Soldier Sound Pack</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/original-half-life-soldier-sound-pack/10920</link>
    <description>Hi everyone!
I have to admit Black Mesa is one of the best mods I&#39;ve ever played and particularly an honor to my favorite game of all time!

With all my excitement, after completing the game, I decided to bring the original soldier sounds from Half-Life (radio, dialogues, etc) to the mod and started experimenting.. Now its finished and I would like to share it with you! Tell me what you think!

All sounds used for edit are Valve corporation copyright

<p>“Distortion” technichally is a function on most amplifiers and some effect pedals which gives guitars (or other instruments) a more grungy “rock” sound. So yeah of COURSE there is distortion.</p>
<p>You need to define your terms better.</p>

</aside>
<p>wow, such ignorance!<br>
Distortion has another meaning when it comes to sound engineering.<br>
Have any of  you heard the concept of “Compression” in music?</p>
<p>check this :<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Magnetic#Criticism_regarding_production" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Magnetic#Criticism_regarding_production</a></p>
<p>just follow the links that have “distortion” “compression” etc.<br>
Few examples of compression in music is Metallica’s Death Magnetic and Iggy Pop’s Raw Power. Especially this last one. You will fully understand the concept of “Distortion” once you hear tracks from this album (please search only the 1996 version. The olders one are MUCH Better and don’t have distortion).</p>
<p>As for the pack, thank you mate! Really something i was looking for. This is the only voice files that i think are a bit inferior in that AWESOME remake!</p>

            <p>hi, thanks for your good words</p>
<p>I don’t know about the whole soundtrack dude…<br>
You can still decrease music volume or even disable it, but to me it was not that disturbing, actually i found it pretty good</p>

<p>False. I downloaded the soundtrack as well, played it on my iPhone and on my Polk Audio sound system and there’s definetly distoriton in some of the tracks.</p>

<p>I just signed up to this forum to say this:</p>
<p>Brilliant work my friend! this is EXACTLY what I was looking for. The new voice acting is great, but the original commando sounds were far superior to the new ones.</p>
<p>Is there a chance you can upload another pack with the original HL1 music? Make no mistake, I think the new soundtrack is fantastic, but it seems they exported the songs with the volume too high and there is distortion in most of the tracks.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
