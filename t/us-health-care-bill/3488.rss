    <title>US Health Care Bill!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/us-health-care-bill/3488</link>
    <description>This isn&#39;t so much for debating about health care (although it&#39;s unavoidable). I&#39;m starting this thread because you can watch the vote right now on CSPAN.
Basically, if the House of Representatives passes this vote, we as Americans get some basic health care reforms that we&#39;ve been waiting 3 decades for. There&#39;s also most likely going to be a minor riot on the national mall as a few thousand teapartiers pitch a hissy fit that the vote didn&#39;t go their way.
 Check it out.

<p>Oh please, they didn’t know they couldn’t afford them. If you only ever bought a house that you could afford outright, nobody would buy a house until they were 60 and would end up living in a box.</p>
<p>They were openly deceived by the banks trying to con them out of more money. When they defaulted, the banks repossessed their house and tried to sell it. However, because that was happening on such a massive scale, the price of houses plummeted, meaning that the house didn’t raise enough money to cover the bank’s outstanding debts. Hence, you get a simultaneous crash of both the financial and housing markets.</p>

            <p>It’s in massdebating, of course! But don’t worry about it, this thread is /thread pretty much since health care is as reformed as its going to get in the near future. Although there’s talk amongst congressional liberals of a second round of reconciliation bills to create a public option. Will bump with more info as it arrives.</p>

<p>You do know that many fiscally responsible people were hurt by this too, right?  When suddenly their $1200 mortgage payment became $2200 virtually overnight, right?</p>
<p>The “bad loans” were a very small part of the meltdown by the way.  But, evidently, in some people’s minds, it was the ONLY reason it happened.  The biggest reason for it (and I’ll continue this in another thread if you’d like):  Investors buying mortgage-backed securities and selling them.  It wasn’t that foreclosures were happening.  It’s that the investment companies relied on mortgages staying afloat to keep them in business, so they gave sweet deals to foolish buyers, then when they couldn’t follow through on these deals, raised the costs on the foolish buyers, and the buyers could no longer pay, so the investment company was forced to foreclose…hurting their business because now there are securities out there with nothing to back them up.  So, now the investment company goes out of business, hurtling the economy towards the toilet.</p>
<p>Yes, the buyer was foolish, but that’s only one small piece of the puzzle.</p>

            <p>This definitely deserves its own thread (see: my econ 101 thread) but probably not until after Easter Recess when there’s actually a financial reform bill to discuss.</p>
