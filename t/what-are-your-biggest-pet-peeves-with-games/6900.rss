    <title>What are your biggest pet peeves with games?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-are-your-biggest-pet-peeves-with-games/6900</link>
    <description>As the title says, share your biggest pet peeves with games today.

Remember, this is pet peeves, as in small stuff that&#39;s not a big deal but it just annoys you.

This is [u][b]NOT[/b][/u] a thread to talk about major issues like paying for DLC or Console vs PC/other console or some other bullshit like that.

So, a big pet peeve of mine is console related, specifically with the PS3 but I bet the 360 and Wii also have this issue, but I find it a bit annoying how console games these days do not let you exit the game from the main menu and instead you have to close it by pressing the Home button and closing the game from there.

I mean, really, why hasn&#39;t this been implemented yet?</description>

<p>The m60 and all them are pretty shitty guns. They take days to get a kill, they’re really inaccurate and they take an hour to reload. Really the only thing they’re useful at is flanking a swarm of enemies and killing them from close range. You really need to get a big drop on someone to kill them with a LMG, otherwise they just turn around and kill you first.</p>
<p>The good guns are things like the abrakan and the ump.</p>

            <p>Where do I start?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Publishers charging full price for half a game. In the age of lazy developers using multi-player as a crutch, a new pricing model is needed. If you are going to release half a game, release a version stripped up multi-player and vise versa. I don’t do multi-player so I almost always wait until the price drops to a reasonable level. Crysis 2 is the first game I have bought at full price since being burned by COD 4 but then again, I got a $20 pre-order credit plus pre-order pricing. The same with Portal 2 and Fear 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of auto-save. Look, I have children and other responsibilities. I often time need to needlessly replay sections of games after being forced to quit during the middle of a section. Doesn’t need to happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First person shooters without the ability to go prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endlessly spawning bad guys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Games that should be great but aren’t because of console limitations. Biggest offender, Crysis 2. You could see it by playing it. This games should have been the greatest game since Half Life 2. Even though it was clearly developed for the PC and ported to consoles, far too many compromises were made which turned what should have been an all-time great into a merely above average first person shooter.</p>
</li>

            <p>Reading Lost one and Toltuk’s comments reminded me of something that has been bugging me lately in Modern Warfare 2, getting called a cheater when there are no cheats whatsoever. Apparently using a minimap, UAV, a decent pair of headphones, and some common sense to figure out exactly where people are is enough for some to call you a cheater the for the whole match instead of playing the damn game.</p>

<p>Oh god don’t I know it. I don’t remember when this was but I was DPSing for a tank in WoW once, and he said he liked to pull big. I was playing druid feral at the time and was around early 30s. Back then skills pulled threat not forms or stances or whatever. And when he pulled too much for us to take down quickly, I jumped into my bear form and started spamming my AoE to do as much damage as possible. From then on he kept trying to tell me how to dps. I didn’t have an AoE for cat form so I made due with what I had. Finally got sick of it, and went to leave when the guy ran straight for the final boss in the final room before clearing the side rooms, and pulled everything that was left. Killing the group. I jumped ship before I got killed.</p>
<p>Kids think they know everything. Theres more than one way to play games, and people fail to realize this. Just because you found one way, doesn’t mean everyone has to follow that way. Thats like going into a maze and someone goes “Theres an easy way through!” And starts breaking down the walls to the other side, ruining the maze for everyone else that wants to do it themselves.</p>

<p>Haven’t played brothers in arms series.</p>

            <p>When 12 year olds play games not meant for their age group. IE: Call of Duty. World of Warcraft. ect.</p>
<p>When a game doesn’t tell you what to do, of if they do it’s very vague. IE:FlyFF where they tell you to go talk to this guy but they don’t tell you where they are, or they tell you to kill 15 of something but they’re in such a remote place you spend hours looking for them.</p>
<p>When people try to be your own personal DJ over Vent, or what ever voice communication system. If you’re going to listen to music while you play games thats your perogetive but don’t force people to listen please. &gt;&gt;</p>

            <p>Games that take too long to be released. :fffuuu:</p>
<p>In all seriousness, it sucks when games only take a few seconds to pass. Happens almost all the time nowadays. There exists new games that are fairly difficult and time taking. Like World of Warcraft… Just kidding once again. Demon souls is a good example though.</p>
<p>I still enjoy these new games of course. It’s good to play the older games when you’re in the mood for it.</p>

<p>Well, every time you fight him up until the last form of the final battle (when he’s in the robot thing) were kind of difficult, and the very first fight, when you take Colette to the tower, is pretty much impossible. His very last form is pretty weak though, which is kinda disappointing. Even more so if you were doing all the side quests, which would mean you would have to fight through the cursed book and defeat Abyssion for the cursed weapons quest. In comparison to Abyssion, Yggdrasil/Mithos is a cake walk.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s right. I forgot about the robot thing after the first stage of the fight. And for the side quest thing, Sword Dancer? God damned impossible 2nd or 3rd time around.</p>
<p>Anyways, my biggest pet peeve gaming wise is probably not the games itself, but more the people who consider themselves hardcore gamers because they play to much CoD. I ask, “What do you think of Half-Life, then?” They respond, “What-Life?” How about classical Mario or some Tetris? “They’re both retarded wannabe CoDs.” You heard it from the experts of the gaming industry, every video game in existence and maybe even hands-on physical activity games are just wannabe Call of Duty games.</p>

<p>That’s kind of another pet peeve of mine from RPGs - having side bosses that are way harder than the last boss. Seems dumb story-wise, but I suppose from a gameplay aspect I understand why they put them in there.</p>

            <p>-mandatory control calibration right when you start the game (i.e. Halo CE)<br>
-press-the-button-quick-before-it-stops-flashing sequences (ps2 loved these)<br>
-how the player can take ridiculously high amounts of damage without dying (a grenade within 10 feet should be an automatic death)<br>
-instant health packs (it should take time to heal, more of a penalty)</p>

<p>I also get annoyed at sub-par animations for a game, where things clearly don’t look too good in motion, like poor weapon animations.</p>

<p>ME TOO! One of the first things I look for in a game is animation, I’m assuming you just looooove COD weapon animations <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>3rd is the idea of reload. Most games these days whether they say sim or realistic still have that.  Total number shots left game mechanic.<br>
and in combination of this.<br>
reload often you dont want to run out of ammo in the middle of a fight.<br>
WHICH WILL HAPPEN.<br>
So now me and others (don’t know about any of you guys, but still others as well) have been trained to reload after every shot. heck we reload while still shooting at someone.<br>
Its just so damned insulting. that they have this quote in so many games now.  It adds insult to injury.  they just need to make it to where you can only reload after you have A. Emptied out the magazine.  OR B. have 3 shots left.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Um, that’s not up to developers to fix, you need to fix that with yourself, I am also one of those people, I reload after each kill, except in BF2 or games that also have that reload system.</p>

<p>In real life you would not be dropping magazines unless they were empty. Tactical ammo conservation dictates that you hold on to them until you are out of full magazines, then you start using the partial ones.</p>
