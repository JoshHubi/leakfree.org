    <title>Classic HECU voices in black mesa?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/classic-hecu-voices-in-black-mesa/62966</link>
    <description>Anyone know how to revert the HECU back to their old voices? I really don&#39;t like the new ones they sound really lame imo. The only mod I can find on the internet that does this is on the workshop and it is broken. Which is bizarre to me you would think there would be lots of mods that do this. Anyone know?</description>
