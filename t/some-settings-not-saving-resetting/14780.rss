    <description>If i turn on God Rays for example and leave the game, it switches back to off once i start it again, cloud steam sync is enabled.
Also lot&#39;s of textures in the game look very low res, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s my issue or if that&#39;s just the way it is and I just didn&#39;t notice before.</description>
