    <description>Okay, I know I just posted recently that I loved the Surface Tension Uncut addition to Black Mesa and I know that the uncut version of &#39;On A Rail&#39; is coming soon. My only question/guess is what comes after that and there are basically 2-3 things:

1. The Xen levels are next
2. Some new Multiplayer Maps are developed
3. One of the Half-Life Anthology&#39;s (Blue Shift/ Opposing Force) gets announced as being remade. I would include &#39;Decay&#39; but since that was for PS2 and not PC I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be made.

These are guess&#39; I am making and at the same time questions as to what the next step after On A Rail Uncut is added in the next update. The main question is what are you guys going to do after the On A Rail Uncut update?</description>

<p>I have been following Black mesa since 2006. I know what to keep in mind. This was a question for  the  developers.  The question is part of my twice  yearly inquiry into the release of Xen</p>

            <p>All the talk of refined content and  level reduxes is all well and good, But where is Xen? Is there any chance it be released this year? After 10 years of following this mod and paying for the early release, It seems that everything else gets worked on save the completion of the game. An unreleased complete game, 2 seperate  partially released builds  and now level updates.   I know the developers will never release the internal release calendar for the Xen parts, but how about throwing us a bone and  releasing the  2009 complete build with all of it’s 1 to 1 remake flaws?  I am sure the Xen in that release pales in comparison to what is being diligently worked on, but it would be something to hold us over during  the rapidly approaching half decade between game halves.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s currently broken, and unlike the version of Surface Tension Uncut that the retail version has, it’s not official.<br>
The<span class="bbcode-b"> official </span>version of STU was built from the ground up by Chon and the rest of the team <span class="bbcode-i">after</span> he was recruited to the team, and is not the same as the “mod” version of STU. On a Rail Uncut is not going to be getting this same treatment. It will not be updated, it will not be integrated into the official build of the game.</p>

<p>Um… lol. This post is… impressive, at the very least.</p>
<p>So, first things first: There is (and likely won’t be either) no OaR Uncut. The team has stated that there will be no more Uncut chapter updates after STU was out. By now, STU is and will be the only one. If it is to ever happen, it will be after Xen.</p>
<p>There will also be no OP4/Blue Shift/Decay/whatever HL remake you want made by CC. For BS and OP4 re-imaginings see Tripmine Studios, with Guard Duty (BS) and Operation Black Mesa (OP4): <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/operation-black-mesa" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moddb.com/mods/operation-black-mesa</a> <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/guardduty" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moddb.com/mods/guardduty</a></p>
<p>Or, BMI, which is being developed by only one person, using BM’s content. It looks very promising: <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-insecurity" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-insecurity</a></p>
<p>As about the MP side, Chon (textfamguy) mentioned that he’s working on some new MP maps, but nothing major to say about them yet.</p>

            <p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but On A Rail isn’t going to be “uncut”. The way it is in BM is the way the team intended it to be. (Unlike Surface Tension, which had to be shortened in the original release due to the lead designer for the chapter leaving the team due to real-life concerns.)</p>
