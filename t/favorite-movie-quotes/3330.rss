    <description>What are they, and why?

[indent]&quot;[i]Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking big television, choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers. Choose good health, low cholesterol, and dental insurance. Choose fixed interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. Choose leisurewear and matching luggage. Choose a three-piece suit on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourselves. Choose your future. Choose life... But why would I want to do a thing like that? I chose not to choose life. I chose somethin&#39; else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you&#39;ve got heroin?[/i]&quot; [b]- Mark Renton [Ewan McGregor][/b] in [u]Trainspotting, 1996.[/u][/indent]

I love it, because it just describes how pathetic the average-guy&#39;s life can be so miserable, even from a heroin-addict point of view.

[indent]&quot;[i]Warning: If you are reading this then this warning is for you. Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don&#39;t you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can&#39;t think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it? Do you read everything you&#39;re supposed to read? Do you think every thing you&#39;re supposed to think? Buy what you&#39;re told to want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you&#39;re alive. If you don&#39;t claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned&quot;[/i] -[b] Tyler Durden [Brad Pitt][/b] in [u]Fight Club, 1999[/u][/indent]

I like this one because it is pretty unusual for a pre-movie Warning, don&#39;t you think?</description>

<p>but yeah. Here’s mine.</p>
<p>Pee-wee: I wouldn’t sell my bike for all the money in the world. Not for a hundred million, trillion, billion dollars!<br>
Francis: Then you’re crazy!<br>
Pee-wee: I know you are but what am I?<br>
Francis: You’re a nerd!<br>
Pee-wee: I know you are but what am I?<br>
Francis: You’re an idiot!<br>
Pee-wee: I know you are but what am I?<br>
Pee-Wee, Francis: I know you are but what am I? I know you are but what am I? I know you are but what am I? Pee-wee: Infinity!<br>
Francis: No, I’m not.<br>
Francis, Pee-Wee: You are! No way! Knock it off! Cut it out!<br>
Francis: Shut up, Pee-wee!<br>
Pee-wee: Why don’t you make me.<br>
Francis: You make me!<br>
Pee-wee: Because. I don’t make monkeys, I just train 'em.<br>
Francis: Pee-wee listen to reason.<br>
[Pee-Wee cuffs his hand around his ear in a listening motion]<br>
Francis: Pee-wee!<br>
Pee-wee: Sh! I’m listening to reason.<br>
Francis: Pee-wee!<br>
Pee-wee: That’s my name, don’t wear it out.<br>
Francis: Remember the first time I saw your bike? You came riding past my house and I came running out to tell you how much I liked it even way back then?<br>
Pee-wee: I love that story.<br>
[jumps on bike and pedals away]<br>
Francis: You’ll be sorry, Pee-wee Herman!</p>

<p>-Snakes On a Plane (TV censored version)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I had to hear that one for myself - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1uaGtScNlE&amp;feature=related" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">oh god, it’s true</a> :fffuuu:<br>
(I think I just found my new favorite <span class="bbcode-i">monkey fighting</span> quote.)</p>
<p>That said, my previous favorite quotes were from <span class="bbcode-b">Army of Darkness</span>:<br>
[i]<br>
* All right, you primitive screw-heads, listen up! See this? This… is my BOOMSTICK!!! - [continuing nonchalantly] - It’s a twelve-gauge, double-barreled Remington. S-Mart’s top of the line. You can find this in the sporting goods department. That’s right, this sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Retails for about $109.95. It’s got a walnut stock, cobalt-blue steel, and a hair trigger. That’s right… shop smart: shop S-Mart… YOU GOT THAT?!?</p>
<pre><code>* It's a trick. Get an axe.

* First you wanna kill me, now you wanna kiss me. Blow.

* Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.[/i]</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>CAN YOU COUNT SUCKERS? I say the future is ours, if you, can count… Now look at what we have here to day before us:<br>
We’ve the Saracens sitting next to the Jones Street Boys. We’ve got the Moon Runners, right by the Van Cortlandt Rangers! Nobody, is wasting nobody. That, is a miracle. And miracles, are the way things ough to be.<br>
You’re standing right now with 9 delegates, from a hundred gangs… and there’s over a hundred more. 20 000 hardcore members counting affiliates, and 20 000 more unorganised, but willing to fight.<br>
Sixty thousand soldiers…<br>
Now there ain’t but 20 000 police in the whole town! Can you dig it?<br>
Can you dig it?<br>
CAN YOU DIG IT?!?</p>
<p>One gang could run this city. One gang. Nothing would move without us allowing it to happen. We could tax the crime syndicates, the police. Because we got the streets suckers!<br>
Can you dig it?</p>
<p>The problem in the past has been the man turning us against one another. We have been unable to see the truth because we have been fighting for ten quare feet of ground. Our turf. Our little piece of turf… That’s crap brothers! The turf is ours by right because it’s our turn.<br>
All we have to do, is keep up the general truce. We take over one borough at a time! Secure our territory.<br>
Secure our, turf.<br>
Because it’s all our, turf!</p>

            <p>“A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it. Fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet.

            <p>Kelly: Well Oddball, what do you think?<br>
Oddball: It’s a wasted trip baby. Nobody said nothing about locking horns with no Tigers.<br>
Big Joe: Hey look, you just keep them Tigers busy and we’ll take care of the rest.<br>
Oddball: The only way I got to keep them Tigers busy is to LET THEM SHOOT HOLES IN ME!<br>
Crapgame: Hey, Oddball, this is your hour of glory. And you’re chickening out!<br>
Oddball: To a New Yorker like you, a hero is some type of weird sandwich, not some nut who takes on three Tigers.<br>
Kelly: Nobody’s asking you to be a hero.<br>
Oddball: No? Then YOU sit up in that turret baby.<br>
Kelly: No, because you’re gonna be up there, baby, and I’ll be right outside showing you which way to go.<br>
Oddball: Yeah?<br>
Kelly: Yeah.<br>
Oddball: Crazy… I mean like, so many positive waves… maybe we can’t lose, you’re on!</p>

            <p>Two good ones from a fantastic movie:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">What? No. We can’t stop here. This is bat country!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers… Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get into locked a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we’d get into that rotten stuff pretty soon. </span></p>

            <p>Evil: “I have understanding.”<br>
Robert: “Understanding of what, Master?”<br>
Evil: “Of digital watches. And soon I shall have understanding of video cassette recorders and car telephones. And when I have understanding of them, I shall have understanding of computers. And when I have understanding of computers, I shall be the Supreme Being. God isn’t interested in technology. He knows nothing of the potential of the microchip or the silicon revolution. Look how He spends His time: 43-species of parrot. Nipples for men!”<br>
Robert: “Slugs?”<br>
Evil: “Slugs?! He created slugs?! They can’t hear. They can’t speak. They can’t operate machinery. I mean, are we not in the hands of a lunatic?  If I were creating a world, I wouldn’t mess about with butterflies and daffodils; I would have started with LASERS!  8:00!  Day one!”  *ZAP!<em>OOH!</em>  “Sorry.”<br>

            <p>I pulled this quote from the movie ‘NAKED’ by Mike Leigh, I recommend watching it.</p>
<p>Louise: So what happened, were you bored in Manchester?</p>
<p>Johnny: Was I bored? No, I wasn’t fuckin’ bored. I’m never bored. That’s the trouble with everybody - you’re all so bored. You’ve had nature explained to you and you’re bored with it, you’ve had the living body explained to you and you’re bored with it, you’ve had the universe explained to you and you’re bored with it, so now you want cheap thrills and, like, plenty of them, and it doesn’t matter how tawdry or vacuous they are as long as it’s new as long as it’s new as long as it flashes and fuckin’ bleeps in forty fuckin’ different colors. So whatever else you can say about me, I’m not fuckin’ bored.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>^This. Pretty much ever line in Pulp Fiction is gold. Also</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000619/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pumpkin</a></span>: The way it is now, you’re taking the same risk as when you rob a bank.  You take more of a risk, banks are easier. You don’t even need a gun in a  federal bank. I mean, they’re insured, why should they give a fuck? I  heard of this one guy, walks into a bank with a portable phone. He gives  the phone to the teller, a guy on the other end of the line says, we’ve  got this guy’s little girl, if you don’t give him all your money, we’re  gonna kill her.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001625/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Yolanda</a></span>: Did it work?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000619/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pumpkin</a></span>: Fucking-A right, it worked. That’s what I’m saying. Knucklehead walks  into a bank with a telephone! Not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fucking  phone. Cleans the place out, doesn’t even lift a fucking finger.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001625/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Yolanda</a></span>: Did they hurt the little girl?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000619/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pumpkin</a></span>: I don’t know, there probably never was a little girl in the first place.  The point of the story isn’t the little girl, the point of the story  is, they robbed a bank with a telephone. <span class="bbcode-b"><br>
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001625/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Yolanda</a></span>: You want to rob banks?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000619/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pumpkin</a></span>: I’m not saying I want to rob banks, I’m just illustrating that if we  did, it’d be easier than what we’ve been doing.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001625/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Yolanda</a></span>: No more liquor stores?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000619/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pumpkin</a></span>: What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more liquor stores. Besides,  it ain’t the giggle it used to be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores  these days. Vietnamese, Koreans, they don’t even speak fucking English.  You tell them, empty out the register, they don’t know what the fuck  you’re talking about. They make it too personal, one of these gook  fuckers is gonna make us kill him.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001625/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Yolanda</a></span>: I’m not gonna kill anybody.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000619/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pumpkin</a></span>: I don’t want to kill anybody either. But they’ll probably put us in a  situation where it’s us or them. And if it’s not the gooks, it’s these  old fucking Jews who’ve owned the store for fifteen fucking generations,  you’ve got Grampa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking  Magnum in his hand. Try walking into one of those places with nothing  but a phone, see how far you get.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Aldo Raine</a></span>: [<span class="bbcode-i">a smack is heard offscreen</span>] Here that? That’s Sgt.  Donny Donowitz. But you might know him better by his nickname. The Bear  Jew. Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you gotta have heard of the  Bear Jew.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0759898/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sgt. Werner Rachtman</a></span>: I have heard of the Bear Jew.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Aldo Raine</a></span>: What did you hear about him, Werner?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0759898/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sgt. Werner Rachtman</a></span>: He beats German soldiers with a club<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Aldo Raine</a></span>: He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat is what he does. Now,  Werner, I’m gonna ask you one more goddamn time, and if you still  “respectfully refuse,” I’m callin’ the Bear Jew over here, and he’s  gonna take that big-ole bat of his, and he’s gonna beat you to death  with it. Now take your wiener schnitzel lickin’ finger and point out on  this map what I want to know.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0759898/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sgt. Werner Rachtman</a></span>: Fuck you.<br>
[<span class="bbcode-i">pause</span>]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0759898/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sgt. Werner Rachtman</a></span>: And your Jew dogs!<br>
[<span class="bbcode-i">the Basterds all laugh</span>]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Aldo Raine</a></span>: Actually, Werner, we’re all tickled to here you say that. Frankly,  watchin’ Donny beat Nazis to death is is the closest we ever get to  goin’ to the movies.<br>
[<span class="bbcode-i">Calling offscreen</span>]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Aldo Raine</a></span>: DONNY!<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0744834/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Sgt. Donny Donowitz</a></span>: [<span class="bbcode-i">From offscreen</span>] Yeah?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Aldo Raine</a></span>: We got a German here who wants to die for his country! Oblige him!</p>
<p>And finally</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Aldo Raine</a></span>: You didn’t say the goddamn rendezvous was in a fuckin’ basement.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1055413/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Archie Hicox</a></span>: I didn’t know.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Aldo Raine</a></span>: You said it was in a tavern.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1055413/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Archie Hicox</a></span>: It is a tavern.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Lt. Aldo Raine</a></span>: Yeah, in a basement. You know, fightin’ in a basement offers a lot of  difficulties. Number one being, you’re fightin’ in a basement!</p>
<p>Tarantino is a genius when it comes to writing dialogue.</p>
