    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/just-out-of-curiosity/4017</link>
    <description>Not trying to be troll bait or anything. 
But when the team announced a 2009 release, I would assume that meant the release, at the least, wouldn&#39;t be too much later than early in the new year.
Or was the 2009 mark just pulled out of nowhere as a.... motivator for the team? rather than a.... marker of when things &#39;could&#39; have been completed, theoretically.
I only ask so I know whether I should hang a lot incase it wasn&#39;t just a motivator and release is soon, or if I should sleep many more hours a day.

I&#39;m generally a lurker, just one of those questions that floated around in my head.</description>

<p>I guess what I am trying to say is, if you want to lurk then lurk. If you wanna get some sleep, GET some SLEEP. If you wanna check in once a month then check in once a month.  <span class="bbcode-b">Make it a quarterly thing if that is what will help you keep your sanity</span>.  In the end, the developers really do need some space to get their stuff done.</p>

<p>If you’re not being sarcastic, then yes, it does. Thank you. It gives me the feeling of reassurance, not a flood of my own assumptions.</p>
<p>This community is a bit uneasy when it comes to questions about the mod’s progress. Can’t we all relate to our own experiences of curiosity?</p>

            <p>Personally i don’t care how long it takes for the mod to be released because I’ve only been watching it about a year. What I really hope they release with it is the Co op which in my opinion would be the biggest thing of ALL TIME. But before i get trolled i also don’t care if their is or isn’t co op it would just make it that much better for me.</p>

            <p>I’d imagine a huge part of the reason the development ran on so long after December 2009 and there hasn’t been much apparent activity, is because a lot of the developers are school or college going ages and it’s exam season.</p>

            <p>Once I made this Flash platformer game. It started out as a simple little project with like one bigger level. Then it soon became something like 24 levels, and I kept adding more and more features to it. Then I felt like it was finished and that it was awesome. All this took me like 1 month. Then I decided to add a new feature, and later I added 3 difficulty settings. This all took 3 more months. Then for 1 month I felt that I don’t know what else to add to it but that it’s not really finished yet. Then after like 2 months of not knowing what to do, I added a couple of things and I decided it was probably finished. I never felt like it was finished, I just got to releasing it eventually because I ran out of ideas to add. When you’re programming, or creating something as complicated as a computer game, stuff can get so damn unexpectedly delayed that it’s hard to imagine! It’s not like a building, when you say “oh yeah we need to add some doors and windows and paint everything, should take 6 weeks and we’re done.”, it’s more like “we have no freaking idea how far we are into this right now!”. I don’t know about the developers here, but I’m sure they feel like they don’t really know what “finished” really means and when you can say that something is “finished”. It’s difficult to oversee a project of such complexity. I imagine that the mod is in pretty good shape now, probably many of us would say “oh that’s fine I could play that, just release it already!”, but after so many years of work, the developers want to make sure it’s totally perfect. There’s no finish line or mark that tells you something is at 100%.</p>

<p>EDIT: Wasad, do you mean it’s nice to see they’re working on Xen, or do you mean it’s nice to see they’re working.</p>

<p>Well, im glad that they are now working on XEN. I guess it’s really hard because its another gameplay and crazy design. Must be hard work but i hope everyone is having fun while creating this chapter.</p>
<p>I suppose, Xen is a big part where the developers can implement more of their own stuff than on earth. It is totaly diffrent to everything else in the game. After such a long developing time, it must be a great feeling to work on xenian details!</p>
<p>Every screenshot in of the media shows what we can expect. I remember me back in time,  playing HL first time and jumping into the Xen Portal without knowing whats waiting behind the Portal. It stunned me. I stand on the platform and it was amazing. I totally loved the skybox and everything on xen.</p>
<p>Hope the developers got the same feeling, while completing Xen. Seeing Everything growing alive. Thats why im happy  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>pewpew pew</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t care how long it takes as long as it eventually gets released at some REASONABLE point in time.</p>

<p>Haha, and what’s sad now, is that, nobody can say something like “Cool can’t wait to see it”, because they’ll assume we are assuming it’s near finished and be released within the month.</p>
<p>Cool, can’t wait to see it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Anyway, that doesn’t say anything about progress, I’ve worked on small things and actually started near the end. Long as it’s done soon I couldn’t care less…</p>
<p>Now you have me thinking about how Xen looks…</p>
<p>EDIT: Wasad, do you mean it’s nice to see they’re working on Xen, or do you mean it’s nice to see they’re working.</p>
<p>I think most’d say it’s nice to see they’re working… Too many “it’s dead” stuff…</p>
