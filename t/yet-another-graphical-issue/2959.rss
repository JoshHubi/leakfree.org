    <title>Yet Another Graphical Issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/yet-another-graphical-issue/2959</link>
    <description>Ok, so some of you may remember the thread I made a while back asking for help to fix aliasing in Unreal Engine 3 games (specifically, Mass Effect). The basic impression I got from the answers was that there was no way to fix the aliasing satisfactorily while using Directx 9.0c. Well, now I&#39;ve purchased Windows 7 (which I&#39;m pretty sure has Directx 11 built into it). What I&#39;ve been trying to do is to turn on deferred shading or whatever in Mass Effect, but I can&#39;t seem to do it. Could anyone tell me how to do this (or, if I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, some other way to fix this aliasing)? Thanks!

-I hope this will be the last Help and Support thread I trouble you all with :retard:.

EDIT: I would also like to be able to do this in/for Mass Effect 2 as well.</description>

            <p>I know my card does not support Directx 11 features, and I know the game doesn’t. I’m not very knowledgeable in this field, but I know the game isn’t supposed to run like this. I was last told on this forum that the problem lay with Directx 9.0c. I’m pretty sure I can run Directx 10 features with my card, which I believe are included with 11 (otherwise they would make it possible to find the damn thing to install). I was told about deferred shading before, and I want to figure out how to use it (or program it, or whatever).</p>
<p>EDIT: My card runs everything on the highest settings splendidly, the aliasing is annoying and in order to force conventional aliasing on the game, I sacrifice a lot of FPS. I don’t want to sacrifice FPS (or at least not that much).</p>

            <p>Just to make it clear, buying Windows 7 doesn’t automatically give you DirectX 11 benefits if your video card doesn’t support the extra features. I’m not sure what you were hoping to accomplish, because the game itself only supports DirectX 9.0c, so getting Win7 with the newer version of DirectX doesn’t change anything. The only thing I could think of, since I don’t really know the nature of the original problem, is that your video card isn’t powerful enough to crank up the higher detail settings.</p>
