            <p>experienced this too, unless you behave properly in this elevator and exit straight away, you break the flow and get no loading</p>
<p>what i did was go down the ladder to explore below, afterwards going to the sliding doors would not trigger the next loading screen, had to quick-load and behave properly in the elevator</p>

            <p>it seems as getting stuck is possible with most double automatic doors in this mod.  XD</p>

            <p>Same here. I jumped like crazy with crouching and got away somehow.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>You can get stuck in other elevator as well. After explosion, went to the first elevator (rotating one), pushed a button and just when it started to move I walked into the exit of that elevator. Got hit (lost 1 energy point) and it got back to starting position. Had to reload.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Was just about to post this.</p>
<p>What happened: I dropped down from the edge of the elevator while the elevator was moving, result: “loading” screen didn’t come and I was unable to go through the door that is supposed to open.</p>
<p>How I fixed it: I loaded from previous save, didn’t exit the elevator until it stopped, loading screen appeared, the door opened and I was able to continue.</p>
