    <title>Black screen when shot at!!!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-screen-when-shot-at/10605</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

I&#39;ve been playing with almost no bugs, but since I started I&#39;ve had a bitch of a problem. Every time I get shot or hit the screen flashes black, wich means Igo blind for a couple of seconds!!! You can image how frustrating this is in a firefight!!!
Can anyone help please?

Cheers</description>

<p>I tried both. Didn’t work. The DirectX entry on the console froze the pc.<br>
Thanks anyway!</p>

<p>In video options put shadows effects and reflections on lowest, and dxlevel probably didnt freeze you have to wait up to 5 minutes for it to reload the textures</p>

            <p>Videocard is most likely what causes your problem.<br>
If is basically greatly stripped version of Radeon 9700 with next to none onboard memory available for texture storage (usually it comes with 32Mb VRAM which is hardly enough for framebuffer needs, so textures are stored into into main RAM instead and are accessed using AGP/PCIex GART techniques). You should try to follow the same advice I give here to another person with the videocard from that age:<br>

<p>You should also took a look into <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14063" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">FAQ Question 6</a> for details on how to check/switch dxlevels and you should also consider setting texture details and model details to “Low” to conserve as much system bus and memory bus bandwidth as possible.</p>

<p>I know it belongs in a museum, but with the exception of Portal2 it never gave any problems with source games (Half-Life2, episodes 1&amp;2 and Portal).<br>
Actually, aside from the gltches I’ve posted here Black Mesa was running well and looking good!</p>

<p>Thanks, that did it, only I just ran into a bigger problem!<br>
I’m on the “power on” portion of the game. In the room where the Xen blow themselves up after teleportation, I run across the room and as soon as I reach some steps everything goes black!!! I can still see the hud, I hear myself walking but I can’t see a thing.<br>
I’ve lowered everything (even resolution, to 800X600) and the only thing I got was the ability to see a flash of the game, kind of red tinted, when I shot a weapon.<br>
I’ve also restarted the game, my pc, everything!!! I don’t know what to do… again!</p>
