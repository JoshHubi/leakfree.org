    <title>Worst Mainstream Video Games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/worst-mainstream-video-games/6052</link>
    <description>Games that are mainstream and high budget that you thought were shit.

It&#39;s a pretty close one between Halo Reach and Black Ops for worst mainstream game of the year. Black Ops is plagued with glitches on the pc version and boring on any system. Halo Reach has far too much emphasis on semi-auto guns with little gameplay variety, few positive changes from previous Halo&#39;s, a lot of shitty custom game modes, a shit engine that can&#39;t draw player models even at medium distance and too much aim assist/bullet magnetism. Oh and very very very shittily made maps.

Anyone have some good candidates for 2009?</description>

<p>Hate the direction these games went.</p>

<p>Most recent game I was hyped up for, there is no multiplayer only 1v1. I don’t know how much time I put into SC: DA’s multiplayer but it was a lot.</p>

<p>This. I played this after being very sceptical of a friend’s recommendation, and it was absolutely fantastic. Like, brilliant. So very, very camp, but very much in the spirit of the original movie.</p>

            <p>I am late on this one but might as well…</p>
<p>Halo is a rip-off of the Ringworld books.  and the gameplay was nothing new for pc gamers.  Final Fantasy XIII…what crap.  Lost all of the spirit of the original series.  Tron Evolution…love Tron, hated the Prince of Persia rip-off it inspired, much rather play Tron 2.0.</p>
<p>There’s many more, but The biggest disappointment was Jericho.  What fuck up took Clive Barker’s (Hellraiser, Candyman, Lord of Illusions) ideas and turned them into this unoriginal shooter?</p>

<p>The enemy barks were so annoying. They were a bunch of whiney bitches. I couldn’t stand listening to them, or combatting them. It just didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>The puzzles were a pain in the ass. They weren’t well thought out, and a couple of them were completely nonsensical. The one with the death pit was annoiying as all hell and that last one with the mini-game to diffuse the bomb was terrible.</p>
<p>The vehicle sections were awful. Bad controls and terrible combat. I never enjoy sections where I need to depend on NPCs for my driving or my shooting (the jeep section).</p>
<p>The guy chattering in my ear the entire time was a cock-bite even before the “shocking twist”. “Parker, you have to do this! Parker, you have to do that! the minors are dieing and you are their only hope!” Half Life had a similar problem, but they were more like, “Gordon, we need your help,” instead of “Gordon, it has to be you doing everything!”</p>
<p>And the “stealth” section was one of the worst implemented ever (Return to Castle Wolfenstein has the worst(both of them), for those wondering), and didn’t belong there in the first place. I can’t stand sections like that.</p>

            <p>It worked in the GOOD red faction games.</p>
<p>Not saying guerrilla was bad, it was just not RF.</p>
<p>RF:G is to RF as RE5 is to Resident evil. Not bad, just not good enough and not in the spirit of the franchise.</p>
<p>Oh, but that’s nothing compared to Red faction: battlegrounds.</p>

            <p>I don’t know if I’d like it linear. My favorite part of RF:G was driving to a mission and then spontaneously deciding that the building nearby displeased me so I just rammed it with my truck. It needed the open world for me.</p>

            <p>In RF, they had some walls that you could blow a few inches off of, but couldn’t go deeper than that unless you got creative and had a whole lot of satchel charges/rockets.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t mind a linear FPS with destruction like RF1 had.  I know it wouldn’t work too well in a free-roam game, but it would be cool if they tried it and pulled it off well.</p>

            <p>Not really, becuase then you have to limit, much more, what can be destroyed by the player. To make sure they don’t go somewhere they’re not supposed to.</p>

            <p>Yeah. No one wants Fracture’s jello ground. It could be possible with Voxels, but that doesn’t solve the NPC problem. I just want an FPS red faction with all the destruction features.</p>
<p>Maybe making it linear will allow them to have more applicable destruction?</p>

            <p>I’d like to see that in the new one, but I’m afraid it just wouldn’t work. Making an open world that can be totally destroyed while maintaining NPC movement is next to impossible, and then there is the question of making the destruction look semi-believable.</p>

<p>The new Red Faction game…</p>

<p>Unless Armageddon lets you change the terrain, then no.  Guerrilla had great destruction physics for buildings, but that was it.  In the original game, you could destroy almost anything in any level, not just buildings.</p>
<p>I want realistic destruction of the terrain as well as buildings.</p>
