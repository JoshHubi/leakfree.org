    <title>Setting a body to move in a river?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/setting-a-body-to-move-in-a-river/15178</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working on a map for my mod and I wanted to have a sequence where the player comes upon a body washing down an aqueduct. However, my original plan (to parent the body to a func_tracktrain) is impossible since prop_ragdoll cannot be parented. Is there a way to move a physics object on a very specific path without affecting the player? Thanks for any insight! &lt;3</description>

            <p>Try using a trigger_push either with the flags set to exclude players (or, if you really want <span class="bbcode-i">only </span>the body to move, a link to a filter entity).</p>
