<p>Well no shit Sherlock, I said they weren’t being textured by me in this thread, or was it the thread before the forum collapsed?</p>
<p>It’s one of the advantages of having a texture artist on a development team, and I CAN texture and UV unwrap, I just choose not to because I can’t be bothered too.</p>

<p>No, I’m saying you suck so much at modeling that your models can be considered racist, even if that wasn’t the intention.<br>
