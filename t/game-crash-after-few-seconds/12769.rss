    <title>game crash after few seconds</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crash-after-few-seconds/12769</link>
    <description>I am getting &quot;hl.exe has stopped...&quot; error after a set period of time upon launching the game, no matter what I do during those few seconds. I can start a new game, browse the menu or simply do nothing but after about 15 secs the game will crash. Like some kind of time bomb. :&#39;( Please help someone! I REEALLY wanna play this....

I&#39;ve attached the last crash dump.
