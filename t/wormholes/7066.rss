    <description>[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw6JIB3pM2o&amp;feature=feedf&#39;]Nottingham University on wormholes. (Specifically Portal 2&#39;s)[/url] Be sure to watch the video responses as well. It&#39;s about 30 minutes all together.

I found it all very interesting, and honestly had never known that Einstein actually found a way to create a wormhole (Einstein-Rosen bridge,) that worked. (But was so unstable that not even a ray of light could pass through.)

Posting this half way through the first video but I&#39;ve found it pretty cool so far so I thought I&#39;d share it.</description>

            <p>My only issue with the video is that they fixated on the “wormhole” method of traversing a distance. There is a poster in the older sections of Aperture that mentions the “Aperture Science Quantum Tunneling device”. Quantum tunneling is (if I remember correctly) a different method of moving an object from one location to another than “wormholes”. Quantum tunneling is an effect we can see in use (look up tunnel diodes), and could be another method of creating portals without the feedback loop effect, if it could be “ramped up” to work in the world of classical physics.</p>

            <p>I think he wants to spray out that our sense of reality can differentiate between wrong and right in terms of physics. If we didn’t have any recoil animation or a very bad one it would feel wrong somehow. But only because we know that any gun has a recoil. We never made experiences with portals and our mind makes a lot of things up e.g more heavier stuff won’t fall faster. So everything I just wrote is totally false.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don’t know if he knew it was prebaked.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>As soon as I saw the word wormhole I immediately thought of stargate. Of course that’s not where the word came from, but it’s what sticks out most in my mind.</p>

            <p>Yes it was quite interesting, I always find things like this interesting.  I like the discovery / science channel.  Perhaps we should have a thread of just these types of videos / things.</p>

What was finally explained to me was the screeching noise in microphones. lol</p>
