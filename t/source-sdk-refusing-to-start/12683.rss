    <title>Source SDK Refusing to Start</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-sdk-refusing-to-start/12683</link>
    <description>Hello, there.

Getting straight to the point, me and a few other team members have been having trouble getting the Source SDK to start. Launching through Steam brings absolutely zero results, without even bringing up the &quot;Preparing to launch...&quot; window. I&#39;ve also tried launching manually through Win+R, as well as the individual tools in the folder, also non-working.

We&#39;ve all reinstalled and/or verified the cache both the SDK as well as the bases to no avail. We suspect it&#39;s due to Valve&#39;s updates (as usual) but can&#39;t be sure. Any ideas?</description>

            <p>Well this is strange. I was able to open the Hammer Editor from Source SDK just now.</p>
<p>Edit: Seems like compiling works as well.</p>

            <p>Someone posted this on ModDB. I can’t test it myself right now, but if someone else is willing to try it, post results!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Update Source SDK Base 2007 to Steampipe.<br>
Extract the HL2 VPKs to the root common/Half-life 2/hl2/ folder.<br>
At common/Half-Life 2/hl2/bin folder, configure the GameConfig.txt with your mod, changing GameExe and GameExeDir to the Steampipe Source SDK Base 2007.<br>
Add the following to your gameinfo.txt:</p>
<p>game | all_source_engine_paths | hl2/hl2_textures.vpk<br>
game | all_source_engine_paths | hl2/hl2_sound_vo_english.vpk<br>
game | all_source_engine_paths | hl2/hl2_sound_misc.vpk<br>
game | all_source_engine_paths | hl2/hl2_misc.vpk</p>
<p>platform | all_source_engine_paths | platform/platform_misc.vpk</p>
<p>(Join the “|” because ModDB doesn’t allow me to put them together).</p>
<p>This will make work again your tools (Note: the VGUI model select will make crash Hammer at open, so switch to another game configuration every time you want to place props).</p>

            <p>Guys, verify Source SDK’s cache now! It will put in some new files in the sourcesdk folders and we will be able to use it again.</p>
<p>Edit <span class="hashtag">#1:</span> Delete the sourcesdk_content folder from youraccountfolder after Source SDK is updated. It is no longer needed as it is now integrated into the sourcesdk folder. Edit: Actually, delete that too and uninstall and reinstall Source SDK. It’s now part of SteamPipe.</p>
<p>Edit <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> [COLOR=‘Red’]For some reason, I can’t compile any captions. I keep getting this error when I attempt to do so: “Can’t find steam app user info”. I don’t know what to do to solve this issue. Never mind. I figured out how to fix it. This is the solution I used: <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Can't_find_steam_app_user_info" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Can’t_find_steam_app_user_info</a></p>
<p>Turns out it also works for the SteamPipe version of SourceSDK.</p>
<p>Edit <span class="hashtag">#3:</span> Because it’s now in the common folder instead of the youraccountname folder, I made a reconfigured version of the gameconfig file for Black Mesa. Here’s how it should be configured now (I think):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"Configs"
{
	"Games"
	{
		"Black Mesa"
		{
			"GameDir"		"c:\program files\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS"
			"hammer"
			{
				"GameData0"		"c:\program files\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS\bms.fgd"
				"TextureFormat"		"5"
				"MapFormat"		"4"
				"DefaultTextureScale"		"0.250000"
				"DefaultLightmapScale"		"16"
				"GameExe"		"c:\program files\steam\steamapps\common\half-life 2\hl2.exe"
				"DefaultSolidEntity"		"func_detail"
				"DefaultPointEntity"		"info_player_start"
				"BSP"		"c:\program files\steam\steamapps\common\sourcesdk\bin\source2007\bin\vbsp.exe"
				"Vis"		"c:\program files\steam\steamapps\common\sourcesdk\bin\source2007\bin\vvis.exe"
				"Light"		"c:\program files\steam\steamapps\common\sourcesdk\bin\source2007\bin\vrad.exe"
				"GameExeDir"		"c:\program files\steam\steamapps\common\half-life 2"
				"MapDir"		"c:\program files\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS\maps"
				"BSPDir"		"c:\program files\steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS\maps"
				"CordonTexture"		"tools\toolsskybox"
				"MaterialExcludeCount"		"0"
			}
		}
		"SDKVersion"		"3"
}</code></pre>
<p>If you installed Steam in a different location, please edit this to how it was configured.</p>
<p>Edit: For some reason, the Hammer Editor won’t open when I click on it from Source SDK.</p>

            <p>And to think that VALVe could maybe run the SDK at least once after they “patched” it. But no, that’s too hard for their fingers.</p>
<p>They need to look at everything from every perspective… and document the update changes.</p>
