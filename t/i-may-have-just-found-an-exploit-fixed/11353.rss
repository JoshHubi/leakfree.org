    <description>I was stuck on the bit of Residue Processing right before you get to Questionable Ethics. The part where you came in through the conveyors, and there&#39;s the swinging platform you need to manipulate with the lever. How are you supposed to solve that, because I&#39;m 99% sure I brute forced it into a very exploited solution.</description>

<p>This should be in the bugs thread it may be moved; However, tell us how you think its an exploit show us a screenshot/video. Im not sure how this could have been exploited.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know. I’m asking here because I’m not sure how it’s supposed to be solved, I’ll go look up a video on it though.</p>
<p>Haha, Okay. I didn’t even see the switch that opens the gate! Let me save and go back to where I was to get some screenshots of what I did.</p>
<p>Alright, here’s the story so far. I started here.<br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/vLjcm.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/vLjcm.jpg</a></p>
<p>The belt I’m on goes away from the hole, and you have to crouch to get in. However, if you crouch jump repeatedly you can get under the lip, and then do it again to come out on the other side.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JBbVm.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/JBbVm.jpg</a></p>
<p>Doing that puts you in this room.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/M0iJj.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/M0iJj.jpg</a></p>
<p>Edit: I played through it normally and found out it’s pretty normal from this point on.<br>
Once you’re in this room, you go and jump to the left on the belts below, which puts you here. You grab a barrel and put it on the belt.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/YVzzx.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/YVzzx.jpg</a></p>
<p>The barrel goes forward and trips the first mine.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/sYEwy.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/sYEwy.jpg</a></p>
<p>The barrel goes forward and trips the SECOND mine.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/RCqW9.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/RCqW9.jpg</a></p>
<p>And then I fell off the next part, so I have to go get more screenshots.</p>
<p>Edit: Con’t. I’ll be moving this to bugs in a second, copy pasting this essentially.</p>
<p>This essentially puts you in this room.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/GfSQ5.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/GfSQ5.jpg</a></p>
<p>You go across the pipes to the other side, end up here.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PjO0r.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/PjO0r.jpg</a></p>
<p>Jump up, ride the elevator, end up here. (I assume this is where things become normal.)</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/HpfIJ.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/HpfIJ.jpg</a></p>
<p>Jump to the side, find this hole.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/eStaK.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/eStaK.jpg</a></p>
<p>Go down, find this. Ride the belt.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Bq84U.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/Bq84U.jpg</a></p>
<p>End up here<br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/v9gwD.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/v9gwD.jpg</a></p>
<p>Shoot a few barnacles, spot the ladder, climb it.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/qGUv6.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/qGUv6.jpg</a></p>
<p>Find this door, loading screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3GrLg.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://i.imgur.com/3GrLg.jpg</a></p>
<p>And from then on I don’t need to go on. Long story short, If you crouch+jump you can get through belt gates going the wrong way.</p>
<p>Edit: Actually, mod, can you just move it to bugs so I don’t have to flood any more?</p>
