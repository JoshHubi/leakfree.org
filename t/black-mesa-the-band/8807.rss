    <title>BLACK MESA - THE BAND</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-the-band/8807</link>
    <description>Hello all.

I&#39;ve been a follower of the mod for some time now, but have never posted on these forums before. I&#39;m a music student studying in Essex, UK, and with my fellow college band mates we have performed under the name &#39;Black Mesa&#39; for almost a year now.

Our music is largely unconnected with the Half-Life series, although we do have a song titled &#39;Headcrab&#39;. We hoped that you guys might be able to indulge in our auditory wares. You can watch a whole set of ours that we performed recently here:

[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXiGg7ZjIyk&#39;]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXiGg7ZjIyk[/url]

We&#39;d love to know what you think. All criticism welcome! As musicians we need to know what we can improve on  :slight_smile: 

You can find us on facebook here:

[url=&#39;https://www.facebook.com/Black.Mesa.Band.Page&#39;]https://www.facebook.com/Black.Mesa.Band.Page[/url]

And on our website here:

[url=&#39;https://black-mesa-band.webs.com/&#39;]https://black-mesa-band.webs.com/[/url]

P.S - I ought to mention our genre of music (although I dislike labels). We have melded Progressive Metal, Rock, Funk, Jazz and Rap together. Or something to that effect!</description>

<p>Music nowadays is so diverse and bands so unique there’s really no way to give any feedback whatsoever, it’s all subjective. While I like experiments with multiple themes in one song, others call it a cacophony. That and the lack of any musical education keeps me from expressing my thoughts on a level deeper than the usual ‘like/don’t like’. Nevertheless, you’re welcome, I guess.</p>

<p>Thanks. This is actually an interesting selection. While it does make perfect sense, I must admit, there are some names I didn’t quite expect.</p>

<p>No sweat. You’d never guess, I know, but I’m not short on patience.</p>
<p>P.S. Good thing you included that P.S. in OP. I’m used to seeing electronic music posted here almost exclusively so I was about to skip the thread. I actually did a double take at that last line.</p>
