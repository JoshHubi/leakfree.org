*Faps with other hand*

[b]Disregard this post by myself, I no longer want to see the Cremator in EP3 but I do want to see your opinions on the matter.[/b]</description>

<p>I have had a change of taught, after seeing the comments for this thread I no longer want to see the Cremator return, but I do want to see something new and , as some people already suggested, darker enemy. Possibly a Super Elite Soldier. :freeman:</p>

<p>Shephard.</p>
<p>Minus the ‘Super Elite’. Because, if he were the enemy, then VALVe can make another game (like OF) where you take control of Shephard. Which, because you are a human, will make the Shephard in the main game seem like a Super Elite Soldier… because it isnt mindless code working the guy (technically).</p>
<p>This makes sense in my head… so… lets pretend we’re all there for now.</p>
<p>intoooblivion and dias… i have to say… its been a while since a forum has made me cry from laughter.</p>

<p>I’ve watched that before, and good lord it’s long-winded, wordy and dull. If it’s a good sample, then the one thing you can definitely say about the ‘beta storyline’ is that it was way overwritten, and Valve did a great job paring it down the minimalist awesomess that it eventually became.</p>

<p>They don’t even do anything. They’re coded to shoot lasers at you, which they only do in episode 1, beyond that, they just stand around and make fart noises.</p>
<p>I like how in missing information, they’re fucking pissed.</p>

<p>Yeah because the anon leak and raising the bar were definitely the only things out there. :^/<br>
Face it I know more about the beta than you do.</p>
<p>Anyway that whole sequence of the original teleport scene is on my channel, you should watch it and educate yourself.</p>

            <p>I never really thought of them (after reading raising the bar) to be enemies, but basically street cleaners, they show up after a fire-fight and get rid of any bodies. Just kind of NPCs you don’t want to mess with.</p>
<p>Like metro cops at the beginning of the game. Sure, you can induce them into beating the shit out of you, but why would you want to if it’s just going to slow you down? Also, yeah, I did it too, get them to chase you, then book it away from them and barely escape.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>You fail dias.</p>
<p>The original storyline was much darker in story, not just luminescence.</p>
<p>The combine had a brutal propaganda campaign, created arcade games for children which were actually just remote murdering devices, children were set to work in slave factories bulding cremators and other killing machines, and the citadel walls were literally eating the city consuming everything, much more so than in hl2.</p>
<p>The combine were replacing the air with unbreathable gasses, stealing the earths resources and draining the oceans.</p>
<p>Breen found his way to immortality by being a head in a jar, Alyx was brutally murdered by Breen towards the end of the game, the wastelands were filled with xenian creatures and portal storms, resistance was mopped up and the bodies were basically deleted, and the stalkers were set loose on the city with their scythe like arms and laser eyes.</p>
<p>You fought huge synths from the 7 hour war, the half human half machine combine guard, the absolutely merciless combine assassin, the brutal combine elite with active camouflage, kliener dies in the teleport mishap, the rest of the resistance has to hole up in the farthest reaches of the world, the arctic, and is then assaulted by a huge combine army.</p>
<p>And that’s just part of it.</p>
<p>EDIT: The only elements which were silly were maybe the manhack arcades and the breen in a jar.</p>
