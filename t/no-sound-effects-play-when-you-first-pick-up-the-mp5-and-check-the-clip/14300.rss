    <title>No sound effects play when you first pick up the MP5 and check the clip</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-sound-effects-play-when-you-first-pick-up-the-mp5-and-check-the-clip/14300</link>
    <description>Like the subject says, there are no sound effects that play during the animation when the MP5 clip is removed and re-inserted. I&#39;m assuming this is the animation that happens when you first get the MP5.

Also, the muzzle flash is a little underwhelming as is the actual firing sound effect.</description>
