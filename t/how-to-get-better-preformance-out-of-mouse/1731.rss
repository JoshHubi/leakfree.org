    <title>How to get Better preformance out of mouse</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-get-better-preformance-out-of-mouse/1731</link>
    <description>Arggg, I just cant get a good mouse. For starters, I have the old fashioned mouse with the ball in it. It belonged to those OLD compaq presario&#39;s that ran windows 98. The one im using does not have a scroll wheel. And right now, it sucks. Eggs. Recently I found my self a wireless optical reader mouse...but it stops working every 10 seconds. So its an inconvenience when someone walks in and I cant close out the porn tab im looking at.

So I said &quot;fuck it&quot;. Now im back to using that old mouse and it sucks even harder. Its very slow when moving, its a big fail when it comes to gaming. Any tips on cleaning out the ball to make the mouse more efficient?</description>

            <p>While I would (heavily) recommend upgrading to an optical/laser mouse, I do have some tips.</p>
<p>As stated by Kaveros, you should do a good cleaning of your mouse. First, open the ball cover on the underside. There are likely 3 wheels inside. Two of them are for the X and Y axis. The third is simply to give support to let the ball move freely. Remove the ball, and take a Q-Tip or toothpick and pick off the dirt and gunk that has accumulated on the rollers. If you need to, hold them still with a finger while using the other hand for the cleaning tool. Once you have the rollers clean, make sure you also clean the ball (as stated above) to stop more debris from accumulating in the mouse, and also clean the feet of the mouse. There are probably 3 or 4 on your mouse, and you want them to be clean so that there is less friction between your mousepad/desk and the mouse itself.</p>

            <p>Mice with balls.</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of wireless mice cause I haven’t had good relationships with them in the past, but I got a GE optical mouse and its perfect for me.<br>
I never use the page up/page down buttons or the left to right scroll, but its there if I ever decide to use it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Holy shit, ball mouses still exist?</p>
<p>Anyway yeah uh…  There should be a round cover around the ball, turn it like a quarter turn and it should pop off and let the ball fall out.  You should see at least 2 tiny little wheels in there.  Clean all the dirt and shit off of them.  Make sure the ball is clean too while you got it out.  Can’t play with dirty balls…  Then pop that sucker back in there.  You’ll have to repeat the process every so often though, and your resolution is going to suck goat nads.  You’re better off grabbing a Logitech G9 or something.</p>

<p>First unscrew it, clean all the crap out. If the mouse keys don’t click easily enough try putting a small strip or two of paper on the buttons before putting it back together. Then adjust your computer/game mouse sensitivity setting.(write down what it currently is first.)</p>
<p>If you think that’s bad, I once played a game of TF2 while only being able to look up, down and left. Sadly I didn’t suck much worse then I usually do.</p>
