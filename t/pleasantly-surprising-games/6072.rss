    <description>Games that you thought would be balls but turned out to be pretty fun.

Batman Arkham Asylum. I&#39;m distrusting of ANYTHING that is a spin-off of a popular movie franchise as they are usually just spat out very quickly with the hopes that people liked the movies so much they&#39;ll buy the game regardless of its quality. Arkham Asylum, however, is definitely up there as one of the funnest games I have ever played. The combat system was lots of fun, the acrobatic exploration wasn&#39;t overdone as in TRU, it was tons of fun to go searching for Riddler&#39;s tricky riddles and hidden trophies and the characters were humorous interesting and to a certain extent believable.</description>

            <p>I preferred FO3 to New Vegas to be honest, something most people show surprise at when I tell them. I just think the atmosphere is much better, not to mention the story and the ending. New Vegas was a brilliant game, don’t get me wrong, but my expectations were really high from FO3 and it didn’t really live up to them. Didn’t stop me from putting 130 hours into it though.</p>
<p>Pleasantly surprising games…I would say Skate in want of a better example. I played the Tony Hawks games since they started coming out, and I thought the series was getting stale…I did think Skate would just be a poor Tony Hawks clone, but I was really(and pleasantly) surprised.</p>

            <p>New Vegas is a good one, but I was more surprised by how much I liked Singularity, especially since I didn’t care for Raven’s Wolfenstein reboot.</p>
<p>Singularity’s campaign was probably the most fun I had in a single player FPS this year.</p>

            <p>The Simpsons Game, bought it preowned for a fiver as a Christmas present for my gf, but it was actually a decent enough game in its own right. Only problem is, it’s turned my gf into an Achievement whore, she’s banned me from the 360 until she gets at least half of the achievements on all of my games and/or reaches 2000G.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>How in my God’s name could you possibly think Hot Pursuit would be a surprise? :mono:</p>
<p>We all knew it would be good, considering Criterion was in on it and sent it back to its roots. Who the hell are you again?</p>
<p>Hmm, a game that surprised me? Mirror’s Edge kind of did.</p>

<p>It’s pretty fun, but it has far far too many time trails. Hot Pursuit is about bashing the shit out of other cars forcing you to play tons of events that are nothing but getting from point A to point B kind of defeats that purpose.</p>

            <p>It’s not “great” in the same sense that HL2 has good characters, but it’s very fitting and B-movie style. At least it’s not absurdly serious, and fits more with 6 friends having fun in a server than 6 survivors desperately shooting horrifying monsters.<br>
I think of Aquaria: A game I got as sort of an extra in the original Humble Indie Bundle. Now, having finished it, I think it’s on the same par as Braid.<br>
Also, King’s Bounty. I didn’t know what to expect, and it turned out reminding me of Heroes of Might and Magic, but without the base-building aspects or timing your attacks RTS-style.</p>

<p>Turns out that’s exactly what it is, albeit an incredibly entertaining little game with a handsome art style, vigorous gameplay, and great voice acting. It’s one of the better FPSers of our time.</p>

I heard SO MANY bad things. I got it on STEAM for ~$1.50 a year or so ago. It is one of my favourite games. A great atmosphere. Took a bit to get into it, but it was well worth it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Track Mania Nations Forever</span><br>
Free racing game with tracks straight out of a Hot Wheels kit (<span class="bbcode-i">loops, jumps, etc.</span>). Great fun timekiller.</p>

            <p>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. I rented it assuming it was just another piece of shit game. But the Brillant voice acting and facial expression got me excited. And the first level was enthralling. The short comedy was fast and sweet - it got me to giggle. The ending was phenominal, but was out of place. It did’nt make sense, but if you pretend it did, than the ending blew you away. Thing about the ending is, it is awesome to pull one of those endings for a game where you are so sure of good v.s. evil, but it did’nt make sence in a way. You people who played it should understand why it was strange…<br>
The ending literally made me tear up because of how good the writing and acting was in it. Great game, good upgrades, good character relationships/voice acting/facial expressions/ etc, and fun as balls gameplay. 5/5 Get it.</p>

            <p>Not sure if this counts, but this game pleasantly surprised me when I got it free from the App Store:</p>

<p>Especially the Christmas version where the little guy rings a bell every once in a while or puts on antlers…  D’aww…</p>

            <p>I just remembered Spelunky.  It’s very old school, can be very difficult at times, and is pure fantasticalness.  I highly recommend this game, just google it.  It is a free game!</p>
<p>When you die you have to start over, however your progress is sort of saved in a unique way.  I don’t want to spoil it.</p>
