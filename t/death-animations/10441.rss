    <description>Hi, I&#39;m loving black mesa thanks so much for making it.  :smiley: 

After seeing Icky nom that scientist in Apprehension I couldn&#39;t help but wonder about death scenes. This would mean that if Gordon is on low enough health, say to get killed with the next attack from the enemy, that a special death animation would play instead of Gordon just dieing. For example with a Headcrab it could be that when the player is on low health the Headcrab will jump at Gordon and latch onto his head &amp; with Gargantua it could be that Garg lifts up Gordon and bites of his head, Sven co-op style. I really think that implementing something like this would enhance the game-play heaps as just falling to the floor can get a little boring.   

What do the rest of you think about this?</description>

            <p>This would be really cool, but it sounds very difficult to do, considering the Source game engine is quite dated now.</p>

            <p>Headcrab was already attempted, sort of. No one liked it though, but it was used more frequently than you’re suggesting. It wasn’t used as a death animation but a sort of QTE.</p>
