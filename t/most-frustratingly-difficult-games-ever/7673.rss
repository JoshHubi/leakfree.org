        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Jet Force Gemini was pretty rough to get the final ending, though maybe that’s just because of the age when I played it. Looking back though, I’m surprised that as a kid I had the patience and determination to find and rescue every freaking tribal on every planet. Probably the first game I ever clocked more than 20 hours on one save.</p>
<p>Also, any strategy game on a difficulty above normal or easy. It’s like there’s no way to make the AI moderately progress in difficulty from one difficulty to the next. I’ll play on one difficulty and win easily, so I think, “Oh, that was too easy, I’ll go on to the next difficulty for more of a challenge.” And then I get raped 2 minutes into the game, before I’ve even built a barracks. It also seems like the difficulty increases exponentially with the amount of enemies you have, probably because the computer can efficiently coordinate with itself.</p>

I never progressed beyond stage 3 on that game, on easy.</li>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Alone in the Dark.</span><br>
Goddamn Central Park driving level. After I finished that sequence I never went back to do it again.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Battletoads.</span><br>
That freaking level where you have to dodge barriers while flying. Managed to pull it off (on the GameBoy version) once or twice. So frustrating that I never want to do it again.</p>

<p>N as in the flash game Ninja?  I love that game <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> spent many hours of CAD class in high school playing that (after classwork, of course :-D).</p>
<p>Also yeah Far Cry is pretty tough.  Xray vision, super damage (eat through your health and armor in 2 hits), etc.  Fun game though.</p>

<p>Yeah, on the hardest difficulty they have x-ray vision or something. Last time i played I tried it on there and every time I snuck behind a tent they could see me and shoot perfectly at me through the tent walls.</p>

<p>Didn’t even feel like lowering the difficulty after that it was so annoying.</p>
