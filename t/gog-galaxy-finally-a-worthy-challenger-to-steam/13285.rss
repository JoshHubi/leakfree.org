If they keep the promises they make in this video, this could be a really cool client. I wonder if Cross Play could extend to friends lists in other clients like Steam or Origin? (Highly unlikely, but I&#39;d love it if they could do that.)</description>

            <p>At first, I wasn’t too interested because I don’t use GOG. I only got it to get the free Fallout games, which I haven’t even played. This cross-play intrigues me though. Very cool idea. Honestly don’t know what I’d buy though, except maybe System Shock 2, but I can get that for $2.50 on Steam Sale. On that topic, if anyone’s played it, would you recommend the Steam or GOG version of SS2?</p>

            <p>Hey, Origin is pretty good too. They just have a pathetic selection of games.</p>
