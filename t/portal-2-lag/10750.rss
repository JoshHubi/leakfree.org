    <description>I got Portal 2, and in the main story areas with the giant GLaDOS chamber and things like that. I looked up the system requirements, and technically, I have the proper video card memory and CPU speed and stuff, but it still lags in the large areas. I only have an integrated graphics on the CPU. Is that what&#39;s causing it?</description>

            <p>What do you mean “technically” meet the requirements? I think it says in the requirements that integrated anything is below the requirements.</p>
