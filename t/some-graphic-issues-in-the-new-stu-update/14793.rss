    <title>Some graphic issues in the new STU update</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-graphic-issues-in-the-new-stu-update/14793</link>
    <description>I have play through the whole game when the STU update is released, and then I found some little issues in the game play.
I hope that someone else can confirm it by rnter the game, so the devs can know that these are really bugs, not my own problem.

2.Look at what i have circled on the xenslime, it seems most like missing textures.(Though it is warped, but you can easily find that this is the PURPLE/BLACK)
I have watched the pictures that [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/34174-bkdale86/&#39;]@bkdale86[/url] had shown to us carefully in the BMMIP2.4 again, the reflection of xenslime in his pictures is not like this screenshot , and the red light besides it is strange, too. I don&#39;t know if it is the right reflection he wants to make
PS: Almost all the xenslime in the whole game have this problem, so I think that there must be something losing on this new material, maybe the light reflection, hope someone enter the game by himself to confirm this.

There are some other problems, but they don&#39;t appear each time, it happens occasionally.
1.The turret in the cliff battle in ST will sometimes disappear, both with its sensor (the red beam on the rock is disppeared, too)
2.The models of Human grunt and Alien grunt in SP map bm_c2a5h sometimes have a error, they look like broken and twisted by something
3.The developers have told me that crossbow bolts are using different models, they are green in SP and another color in MP, but I have found that in the MP, the bolts you shoot out is still the green ones, whether you use right shoot or left shoot, they are all green.

These are issues I&#39;ve found out in the gameplay. Hope developers can confirm and fix them.</description>

            <p>Please don’t start new threads when there are several already for bugs. As for the slime the renders I posted were not from source with the exception of 1. Also they were from an shot with no cube map reflections applied, plus the iridescence effect will render different in game. It’s  not an error.</p>
<p>The sensor goes away when you kill the turret.</p>
<p>Unsure if you are referring to weird ending of the bodies from ragdog physics or what.</p>
