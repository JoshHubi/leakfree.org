    <title>Halo CE Product key</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/halo-ce-product-key/13386</link>
    <description>Okay, yeah I know, this sounds beggar-y, but I really want to play Halo Custom Edition. I had a PC case around here somewhere, but I misplaced it and can&#39;t find it. Can someone PM me their product key? Thanks!
EDIT: Never mind, I found one. Can a moderator lock this thread, please?</description>
