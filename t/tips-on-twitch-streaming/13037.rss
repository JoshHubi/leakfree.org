    <title>Tips on Twitch streaming?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tips-on-twitch-streaming/13037</link>
    <description>I recently got a Twitch.tv channel and would like to stream some content on it- possibly a live, microphoned playthrough of Dark Souls so the internet can hear me scream obscenities at the game live. Or not.

Previously, I&#39;ve been using NVIDIA&#39;s ShadowPlay to broadcast to Twitch, but the resulting video gets all Yakety Sax on me and the content plays at double speed. I like ShadowPlay because of it&#39;s small performance impact and decent quality for saving videos to disc, but the Twitch connectivity is absolute crap. 

So to you, I put the question: Which software would be good for Twitch streaming, and what sort of stuff should I consider streaming?</description>

            <p>A friend of mine told me something about being able to use another computer to handle the stream and to send audio/visual data to it. Streaming games directly from my computer has resulted in often undesirable quality streams, so I would like to offload this to my laptop if possible. How would I go about doing this?</p>

            <p>Okay, took you guys up on it and installed. Any recommended settings? I’d like to get at least 720p quality out of it if possible.</p>
<p>Also, does this require a capture card?</p>

            <p>Like Crypt said, OBS is the best I’ve found for my limited streaming and completely free.</p>

            <p><a href="https://obsproject.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">OBS Masterrace</a></p>
<p>I haven’t used many different programs to stream, but out of the few I have, OBS is my favorite as it’s simple to set up and use.</p>
