    <description>I&#39;ve played this mod before, it&#39;s gone under a significant overhaul with Chapter one being released, thought I would spread the word around.

            <p>The mod looks good, but why are the promotional pictures so overly unabashedly terrible?</p>

            <p><span class="mention">@Fong</span> Just finished it tonight after playing it for so long. It’s a lengthy mod, one of the longer ones I played (Black Mesa included), but well worth the time and effort put into it.</p>
<p>Definitely worth getting and playing at least once. Won’t spoil it for anyone, but let’s just say its systems are very cleaver. And the story line’s pretty good. The Dialog is great, although the choreography accompanying some of the characters could use some work.</p>
<p>Zombies are decent, but some of the animations are off.</p>

            <p>Finished it day ago, I am far surprised by the length of the game and how amazing the character are.</p>
<p>They dialog and reaction is very lifelike.</p>
<p>I am also sad for many character who died.</p>
