    <title>AI/framerate issue with assassins</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ai-framerate-issue-with-assassins/10628</link>
    <description>When I first reached the surface (where you first encounter assassins) the game dropped down to about 5 fps when looking towards the center of the level, maybe 20 fps looking away. I noticed the assassins were being very passive and seemed more interested in jumping around randomly than attacking me.  I finally managed to kill one, and instantly my framerate jumped up to 40+.  The other times I encountered assassins, my framerate dropped a bit but nothing like that.

Has anyone else encountered a similar problem?</description>

            <p>I had the same exact issue in that part, right where the security guard gets killed by the assassin. Restarting the game fixed it for me.</p>

            <p>I had a similar issue in the same place, except it wasn’t the assassins that caused it. The frame rate would drop drastically (like to &lt;5 FPS) any time I’d face towards the center of the big room with the helicopter in it. If I was facing a wall away from the center or if I was outside the room, the frame rate would return to normal.</p>
<p>What fixed it for me was flipping the switch to open the door. The second I hit it, the frame rate returned to normal.</p>

<p>Yeah, i have the same issue and I have a theory. I have the torrent version, and maybe somewhere in the torrent it messed something up. Because i have a pretty awesome machine, i don’t think it’s my computer.</p>

            <p>I think it would be more likely that it would have something to do with you going outside into that particular area. Than the assassins.</p>
