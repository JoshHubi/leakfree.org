Haven&#39;t tried it yet but it&#39;s available for Steam, so I&#39;m downloading at the moment.

Has anyone played this yet?</description>

            <p>Downloaded the game, it is kinda cool, i got really quickly tired of it, and it sucks that you can’t put it on pause and ALSO make the oxygen timer pause.</p>
<p>And it’s the SLOWEST game i have EVER played.</p>

            <p>I still hold that there’s a difference between using electric energy to combine atoms and derive the O2[/SIZE] compound and using electric energy to <span class="bbcode-i">create</span> either an atom or molecule. After all, it didn’t say, “The distributor powers the life-support system, which creates breathable oxygen from a compressed supply,” It said, “…Life support system, which creates oxygen.” I think it could have been worded better, is the point  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Interesting game, though… I really wanted to drive into one o’ those infamous craters, but there were so many invisible walls…</p>

            <p>…<br>
There’s nothing noncomputational about creating breathable oxygen (O2[/SIZE]) from the non-oxygen carbon dioxide. But I can see how you’d be confused by having <span class="bbcode-i">oxygen</span> refer to both the element and the standard compound.</p>

            <p>What are you people talking about? There is audio. Check your options and make sure realistic sounds is disabled as it was by default for me. I get sounds of robots moving, footsteps, cords rustling, beeps and boops, breathing and music.</p>

            <p>I don’t know if the matter of seasons has ben cleared up, and I don’t really care.</p>
<p>Yes, technically the tilt of the earth makes one hemisphere closer to the sun.  But this is <span class="bbcode-i">negligable</span>.  It makes no difference in temperature whatsoever.</p>
<p>The culprit for varying temperatures is the angle in which the light strikes the earth.  Let’s look at the poles for a bit.  Cold, desolate.  Yet in the summer the sun never sets.  Why don’t the poles melt?  The answer is the angle at which the sun strikes the ground.  At the intense angle of the poles, most of the heat simply glances off the ground, never to be absorbed.  In short, the greater the angle, the less light is absorbed, and the more light bounces off.  This is why the equator is so warm.  There is nearly a 90 degree angle between the ground and the sun.  This is also why noon is the hottest part of the day: the sun is directly overhead at that time.</p>
<p>Now, as the earth tilts during seasons, the angles at which the sun strikes the ground are altered.  Right now, the angle at which the sun hits the earth is closer to 90 degrees at the northern hemisphere than the southern.  So the northern hemisphere experiences summer, whereas the southern experiences winter.</p>

            <p>To make this game interesting to the eyes of the public we need something that relates to them. How about the average blue collared american?</p>

            <p>What baconeggs means, I think, is that axial tilt causes sunlight to hit the surface at a different angle, and <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> causes seasonal changes.</p>
<p>So it’s x causes y causes z, not x causes z.</p>
