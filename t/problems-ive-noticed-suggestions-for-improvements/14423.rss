        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The odd thing regarding the tie glitch is that it did not exist for me in the mod version of Black Mesa. Some people reported experiencing the issue in the mod version <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/14960-Those-ridiculous-ties-hovering-slow-tie-glitch/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">back in 2012</a>, but I didn’t experience it until I tried out the Steam version this year (I first played Black Mesa sometime in the first third or so of 2013). Did the Black Mesa team somehow fix the issue before it resurfaced in the 2015 update? I wonder why it didn’t occur for me until I tried out the Steam version? All of that said, while it isn’t a huge issue by any means, it is distracting enough that I think I will wait for a bug fix for the tie glitch before switching from predominantly playing the mod version to playing the Steam version (mostly because it affects pretty much every scientist in the game).</p>

<p>very nice feedback. One more thing that I did not like (but it’s surely not very important) is that you can not schoot / hit friendlies. I know that it’s not correct to teamkill… but it was nice to see scientists panic in the original (because sometimes it looked and sound somewhat funny). Also when you accidently attacked a teammate, they turn against you and maybe make you fail the game (because he became your enemy and won’t open any door for you)… I think it adds a lot of atmosphere and confidence to the game when everything you do has consequences. I also missed some of the old strange and humorous voice lines.</p>

<p>Well, you <span class="bbcode-i">can </span>shoot and kill them, they just won’t flee or change personalities. Even in HL1 the scientists would flee, cower, and refuse to help you, and the security guards would just shoot you. So I agree, I wish there were panic and hostile reactions too. I also wish Gordon didn’t lower his gun when the crosshair is over a friendly NPC if you can just shoot them anyway.</p>

</aside>
<p>The game may receive an update to include these features as well (my guess / hopefully).</p>

            <p>Yeah, having friendly fire opens up a lot more tactical decisions- you can’t just go into We’ve Got Hostiles and unload revolver shots into every living thing you see.</p>
<p>However, I cannot recall anyone suggesting it be removed…?</p>
