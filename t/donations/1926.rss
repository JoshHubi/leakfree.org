    <description>I do appeciate that you release your mod for free, but i think you really should have an optional and [u]reasonably[/u] big &quot;Donate&quot; button on the download page of the mod when it is released. Also a small link on the bottom of pages wouldn&#39;t hurt?

You could use the money to set up a trust fund in order to encourage others in makeing free, high quality, long term projects like BMS. Or just to maintain servercosts.
I don&#39;t really care what you use it for, I WILL DONATE as in appreciaton of your dedication.  :slight_smile: 
Even if it goes towards a beer for the devs.  :rolleyes:</description>
