For those of you who aren&#39;t aware of Burzum, he&#39;s one of the original &quot;Black Metal&quot; artists from Norway. He just got out of prison recently after serving a 14 year sentence for murder and (I think) burning churches. 

I haven&#39;t listened to that style of music for some time, but his new stuff is surprisingly listenable and strangely relaxing. Anyway, &quot;Black Mesa&quot; reminds me of &quot;Black Metal&quot; so here you go, enjoy.</description>

            <p>I like this “one man band” thing Burzum has.</p>
<p>Imagine some black metal fag sitting there with white facepaint, black eye shadow, long greasy black hair, banging the shit out of the cymbals between his knees, double-bassing the bass drum, shredding the guitar and rocking the harmonica.</p>
