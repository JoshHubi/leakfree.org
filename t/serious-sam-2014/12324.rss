&quot;Not sure if there are any Serious Sam players here...&quot;

&quot;Humble Bundle added Serious Sam recently, it included this image and stated that all the funds earned from the SS bundle will go into the development of next Serious Sam game, which will be &quot;the craziest and greatest Serious Sam game ever&quot; and will come out in 2014.&quot;

            <p>I think half the charm of SS3 was that it was ridiculous SS gameplay with a realistic aesthetic. Like, it’s a game based on a hypothetical Serious Sam: The movie. I’m into it.</p>

            <p>2 is ok. The action is what you would expect from their games, the weapons are fun, and the level design is decent. The biggest problem people have from the game is that it is too cartoony, but I think they all are cartoony, so that doesn’t bother me.</p>

            <p>All the games are still in that Humble Bundle, and somewhere around $5 gets you all of them. I’d say start from the beginning, though 3 is a prequel. Just play TFE, TSE (either classic or original) and then 3. I heard that 2 is pretty bad and even Croteam doesn’t like acknowledging it.</p>

<p>If by reboot to make things better and relevant you mean reboot to homogenize and remove originality from a series than yes that is common of late.  I’ve been meaning to get around to playing the serious sam games.  Think I should play the newest one when it comes out or start from the beginning or what?</p>

            <p>Croteam needs to step back and look at what they’ve released so far. Utilizing their newest game engine, they should take the best parts of SS1-2-3 based on public/community/industry feedback, and meld it into SS4. They should take the setting/story and put it in arch enemy Mental’s backyard. If that means futuristic/outer space environments, then so be it. These desert/ruins/forest locations are really wearing thin. So are most of the enemies.</p>
<p>Just after SS1, parts 1 and 2, were released, I remember someone posting leaked screenshots where Sam was in a futuristic building/spaceship and he was battling robots!. That’s be cool, but why do I get the feeling that if they did this, he’d be fighting mechanized versions of the existing enemies (might still be cool).</p>
<p>==================================================</p>
<p>@ Ibanez, there’s a high probability that there’s another Painkiller on the way, or something similar. That’s another franchise that needs a major refreshing, as it’s also becoming predictable/repetitive/stale.</p>

<p>Being a chowderhead does not necessarily make you a slovak, just in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>In other news, I agree with Theegoatpig to an extent, though I think I like the first encounter best simply because I grew up with it. If I were to chose to play SS3 or the Second Encounter it would totally depend on the day and mood I was in. I never really played 2, I saw it at my cousin’s house once. lol</p>
<p>Oh another interesting thing I noted, the games seem to get less “serious” the further they get in the storyline. SS3 in my opinion was the most serious of the set, and the little bit of SS2 was so weird I just can’t even say what about it.</p>

<p>I was told that Serious Sam 3 cost about $500,000 to make so it’s not like they’re blowing a bunch of money on these games and they’re just simple and fun. They’ve already made $350,000 from their Humble Bundle and it’s still going so they’ll probably throw maybe $500,000 into it from their own money for the next game.</p>

            <p>Generally it’s the publisher who decides these things (look what rumors say about Prey 2) either way, it may or may not be good, we will see. Better not to get excited too soon. Other than a promise of “craziest and greatest” we don’t know anything yet.

            <p>Not to mention variety is the spice of life. If everyone decided to try to make the same damn game over and over again, the whole industry would crash. Things are bad enough with developers competing to get some of the CoD pie.</p>
<p>Persona 4 would be considered catering to a niche, as well (hardcore, traditional super hard JRPG), and that game got very high marks and sold strongly despite being released on the PS2 very late in it’s life cycle.</p>

            <p>Some people like to make games for fun and for love of videogames. Besides, Croteam is still around, so I guess they had enough sales to stay afloat.</p>

            <p>It’s a niche game made to scratch a specific itch for mindless horde shooting, it was never planned to compete directly in the mainstream market, so huge sales and godlike scores are never expected in these types of games.</p>

<p>I’m here for your amusement. By not popular anymore I meant the meta scores and sales not too good for SS3. The last game was the very same thing as those before it, just with better graphics.</p>
