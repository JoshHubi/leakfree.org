<p>I just don’t get it. I mean, fine if you want to have early education in music (whether it be a classical instrument or a new one like DJ equipment, synthesizer or be it actual software), but this just seems to me like a trend for rich fuckers to show-off, like designer clothes for the little ones or something. If you want to fuel your kids creative channels, give them some pots and spoons and let them have a little fun. I bet they get the same sounds as scratching over vinyl or randomly hitting keys or turning controllers :retard:</p>

<p>My thoughts exactly. It’s not that stupid in and of itself, but in practice it ends up being bullshit.</p>

            <p>i don’t see how this is anything but a 21st century equivalent to teaching your offspring to operate a vcr or a grand piano. Y’all crumb bums are just mad because you associate djs and turntables with cultures you don’t approve of. Somewhere in the back of your brains you think introducing them to this tech will make them bad spellers. xenophobic fucknerds</p>
