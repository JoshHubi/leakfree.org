    <title>&quot;Happy Holidays&quot;...PC or not?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/happy-holidays-pc-or-not/6033</link>
    <description>I just have a quick question.  Is it politically correct or politically incorrect?  After all, it appears that more people get upset over the term &quot;Happy Holidays&quot; than &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;.

Should we say &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; so that we don&#39;t offend people?  And, if so, at what point is it PC to be politically-incorrect?</description>

            <p>Start - on topic</p>
<p>I thought I’d hop in with my opinion… Overall, I’ve never heard anyone complain about that when I said “Happy Holidays” or otherwise.</p>
<p>The majority of this lies around what’s politically correct on this? I’m agnostic, yet I still celebrate Christmas. Not the religious part of it mind you, but the meaning of the majority of the holidays in this month: the concept of communing with those you love, family, friends, etc.</p>
<p>I don’t get how people would be offended by saying “Happy Holidays” to someone. As it applies to the whole of religions, not just one.</p>
<p>End - on topic</p>

<p>@ Fancy –</p>
<p>Over all, Fancy, I don’t see anything worth reading in your posts. It’s cluttered with rage, names, and cussing that doesn’t need to be there. Act like an adult and maybe people will take to your point to heart instead of getting irritated over it, and reading the peoples posts will strengthen your arguments, I assume you’re about 20+, as such should maintain a level head.</p>
<p>I see nothing out of Garth’s or Dino’s posts that suggests them being the “ultimate authority” on anything, quite the opposite in fact. You on the other hand…</p>
<p>I get what you mean behind your posts though, thanks to a few level headed people… my stance is yes, “Happy Holidays” is politically correct. The minority as usual is really doing nothing but bitching about it. Which is why I have a tendency to ignore that and focus on the main subject of the majority.</p>
<p>TL;DR: You should consider keeping a level head, not cuss, and actually use the god given skills of argumentative conversation. It works wonders for people to come to your point of view.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/sersoft">@Sersoft</a>: That’s from a great standup routine by Jim Gaffigan. Check it out, it’s hilarious.</p>
<p>Hey, sorta jumping in here.</p>
<p>I think the problem will never be which greeting we choose to use during this particular time of year, but people’s reaction to it. I work over-the-phone tech support. I’ve heard everything this month when people disconnect from calls.</p>
<p>“Happy Holidays.”<br>
“Merry Christmas.”<br>
“Well OBVIOUSLY you can’t help me.” <em>click</em></p>
<p>But seriously, I have never taken offense. It’s not really the words that come out of their mouths as much as the purpose behind them. Somebody wants to wish me a happier than average weekend. The only people who would take offense to this are those with a militant agenda.</p>
<p>Nothing is going to ever be ‘PC’ to these types of people. There is their way, and there is everything else and how wrong it is.</p>
<p>My point is Happy Holidays is as good as we’re going to get it. There will always be bad eggs. No point changing what works to stroke the egos of a few opinionated militants.</p>

            <p>It’d be the best if you change the words in your greeting phrase, e.g. " Greeting Marshall! have a nice holiday ," not to add significant one(Christmas, Hannuka, or Quanza), in order to avoid one’s rage.</p>
<p>I ain’t about to object the word “Happy Holidays”; just wanna try some other else ( it’s no need to use the same word to everyone you pass by, isn’t it?)</p>

            <p>I say “Happy Holidays” if I don’t know what holiday someone celebrates.  If I know what holiday they celebrate, I say the proper greeting for that person (Merry Christmas, Happy Hannukah, Happy Kwanzaa, etc).  It’s just easier.</p>
<p>And I say it when I know it pisses someone off because it only pisses off those that claim the mantle of “political incorrectness” whilst hypocritically being “politically correct” themselves.</p>

            <p>Dino: Maybe the school, not the complaining person(s), thought it would be better to just do away with the store entirely than cause a fuss.</p>
<p>In Washington State, there were Christmas Trees put up in the Seattle airport.  Then a Jewish family complained that there were no Hanukkah decorations and sued the airport.  Instead of changing it to a “holiday display”, the airport thought it would be better to just not do anything for the holidays.  Of course, that, too, drew complaints.</p>
<p>But remember, this is being put on by the school, not by the kids, even if it was the kids’ idea.  If a child wants to pray to Mecca, he/she shouldn’t be disallowed from it, but the school should not put it on.</p>
<p>Unless you think there would be no complaints about the school having a prayer session including a “call to prayer”.</p>
<p>And I celebrate Christmas, too.  Got a nice 7 foot tall Christmas tree in my house with a cute little train going around the base.  And a bunch of wrapped presents under it.  Can’t wait!   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’d say Happy/Merry Christmas regardless, offending someone is just a bonus and someone who is offended by such thing to respond back in a manner of feeling offended in my book would be rude.</p>
<p>Besides, I am Atheist, I only do the whole Christmas thing because it’s an excuse to be with my family/friends and get/receive gifts.</p>

            <p>someone doesn’t have to protest and raise a huge fuss to be offended. and whether they’re offended or not, it’s still nicer to include as many people as possible. you’ve all got serious issues if you’re arguing against including more people in holiday greetings.</p>
<p>again, there’s literally NO REASON NOT TO. so i’m not seeing the issue at all.</p>

<p>Ok, I said people who were OFFENDED were in the extreme minority, not people who don’t celebrate Christmas.</p>
<p>And ok, while maybe I can understand how a public school system which is technically a branch of the government shouldn’t name it after a specific holiday, there is NO REASON it couldn’t be called a “Holiday Store” instead. (Make sure to go back and read the full story if you haven’t in my first post, don’t go off the bits and pieces you’re getting.)</p>
<p>Edit: Daniel, I’m really more upset about the fact that the family wouldn’t’ even keep it as a “Holiday Store”, no longer affiliated with a specific religion, but instead demanded the store be removed in it’s entirety because it USE to be the Christmas store.</p>

            <p>Remember, Dino, the public school is run by the government and shouldn’t really be getting involved in religious stuff anyway.  If they do, they do it because no one complains.</p>
<p>However–<br>
There’s nothing saying that private people can’t hold any Christmas thing they want.</p>
<p>The people that complain the most about Christmas are, in my experience, Jehovah’s Witnesses and, to a lesser-extent, Jewish people.  I’m talking about individual people, not the religion at large, by the way.  I haven’t met a single atheist that has had a problem with Christmas celebrations but point out that the Constitution says that government and religion should be separate and, just because it was mixed in the past doesn’t mean that it should in the future.</p>
<p>Remember, this isn’t kids in school doing Christmas stuff, it’s the government doing Christmas stuff.  Try to imagine the government doing other religion’s stuff, such as, dare I say it, Muslim stuff, and getting kids to get down on their knees and pray to Mecca?  Do you think there would be no complaints?</p>

            <p>But the people who are offended by something so trivial are an EXTREME minority and, in my opinion, don’t have the right to take away the rights of others simply because they’re a little annoyed.</p>
<p>I reference back to my original “Christmas Store” example, which I still stand was completely unfair and that the family that demanded the store be removed entirely, even after the compromise, were in the wrong.</p>
<p>Also, it’s Freedom <span class="bbcode-i">of </span>Religion, not Freedom <span class="bbcode-i">from </span>Religion.</p>

            <p>i didn’t say they SHOULD be offended. the fact is that some people ARE, and if you can change one phrase in your vocabulary to avoid offending them and including even more people at the same time, why in the hell shouldn’t you?</p>
<p>and saying someone has rights is just as bad as saying someone doesn’t have rights.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">oh.</span></p>
