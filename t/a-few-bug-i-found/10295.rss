    <title>A few bug I found</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-few-bug-i-found/10295</link>
    <description>First of all, amazing work you did with Black Mesa. It was soooo nostalgic, and yet fresh... I was waiting for it for 4 years now, and it was worth it. So kudos to you all. 

But there were some glitches, and such - not frustrating ones, mind you - which were a little out of place. I just finished the game, and maybe I forgot some of them from the earlier levels.

So when I restarted the game yesterday (after I played the day before) the loading screen was missing or something:

[url=&#39;https://kepfeltoltes.hu/view/120916/snapshot0002_www.kepfeltoltes.hu_.jpg&#39;]Link1[/url]
[url=&#39;https://kepfeltoltes.hu/view/120916/background100000_www.kepfeltoltes.hu_.jpg&#39;]Link2[/url]

At the level, Surface Tension, where there&#39;s the room, with the bombs and the laser mines, that one mine, that is on the box stays there in the air, after the box is destroyed. (if I remember correctly, only one side of the box should be crashed.

[url=&#39;https://kepfeltoltes.hu/view/120916/bm_c2a5e0003_www.kepfeltoltes.hu_.jpg&#39;]Link2[/url]

The other glitches I found:
- When I picked up the Hivehand, it was slightly off place. I saw Freeman&#39;s hand, like he was holding it, but the Hivehand was a little bit left to that.

- In the Teleport Chamber at the end of the game, the first time I played it, it was really smooth. But I died, and reloaded a save right before the doc initated the sequence. After that, the whole scene lagged as hell, if there were more things on the screen, then walls. (I have a quad core, 4 Gb ram, and a GeForce 560GTX, so the problem is not within my machine  :wink: )

- The Controllers in the and seems to take damage randomly. Sometimes they die from one Magnum shot, and sometimes I deplete 40 energy from with the Gluon Gun. And I aim for the head. Allways.

- Much of the music in the game seems to be badly equalized, or something, because there&#39;s too much treble, or bass, my speakers crackle at most of the quicker ones, and when there&#39;s high tunes in it. I listened to it most of the week on my mp3 player, and headphones, and I noticed these that time too, but not as much as in game.

- In the tripmined room, when I crashed a box, and the pieces went flying in the vicinity, crossing the beams, I thought I&#39;ll die, but nothing happened. While it&#39;s not completely immersion breaking, it does seems a little out of place. Maybe the boxes could collapse inwards, if destroyed by the crowbar, or something...

Other than these, I can&#39;t remember any more bugs.

I really enjoyed the game, and can&#39;t wait for the &quot;Episode One&quot;, Xen. 

Oh yeah, on a side note: The old music in the On A Rail, rocket launch part was much more better, then the final one. Maybe it&#39;s just my taste, and it&#39;s easy to replace. I just thought, I might mention it.  :slight_smile: 

So, awesome work guys. I really looking forward for Xen. ^_^</description>

<p>Nem manuálisan bontottam ki, nem vagyok annyira láma.<br>
A legtöbb zene az tetszett, csak ott az a rész az szerintem jobb volt a régi verzióban, mint ami a kiszivárgott videóban is van.</p>
