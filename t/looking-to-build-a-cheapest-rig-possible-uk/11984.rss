    <title>Looking to build a cheapest Rig possible (UK).</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-to-build-a-cheapest-rig-possible-uk/11984</link>
    <description>Has to run MechWarrior Online (Crysis 2 engine with a few extra features) with stable fps and so that it is nice to look at.
Not planning to get a big screen - maximum I need is 1360x768.
Say, I want to spend 250-300 pounds - no more, less is very much welcome.

Suggestions on up-to-date (up to 1 year old) components? Has to be cheap and in stock/be available.

P.S. &#39;*The* cheapest rig possible&#39;. I derp a lot lately.</description>

<p>I heard that AMD is coming out with CPU’s that have a 7850 or similar built in. With the APU thing they are aiming to become even more affordable than intel for cheap performance with minimal amount of parts.</p>

<p>7850 as in radeon? I gonna have to look in to it. Likely It’ll be a bitch to cool though. And will require a bigger PSU.</p>
<p>P.S. the tech is called AMD Fusion. Looks interesting and says that it doesn’t need much power.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em><br>
I do not require 60fps @ 2K resolution and 8x FXAA. All I need is stable 25-30fps at 1366x768, not necesserily maxed out.<br>
Thought it was clear, but as always, there is some unhelpful smartass who absolutely has to crack a derp joke.</p>
<p>Pounds aren’t US dollars if you didn’t realise.</p>
<p>Funny thing is - a simple google search brought out this:<br>
<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing/pc/can-a-300-gaming-pc-compare-to-a-3000-one-1071338/3#articleContent" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.techradar.com/news/computing/pc/can-a-300-gaming-pc-compare-to-a-3000-one-1071338/3#articleContent</a><br>
and this:<br>

<p>All I’m asking for is if there are any up-to-date equivalents of the same shit, since most of the stuff there is either discontinued or hard to find.</p>

            <p>Getting AMD and ATI hardware is prolly my best advice, since they’re cheaper than Intel and Nvidia stuff.</p>
