    <title>Blast Pit - Tentacle Monster, possible issue.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blast-pit-tentacle-monster-possible-issue/10510</link>
    <description>Hi.

I&#39;m loving the game so far, can&#39;t praise it highly enough. I just have one possible glitch that may need to be addressed.

I say &#39;pssible glitch&#39; as this may actually be a deliberate change to the game mechanic in order to make the game harder, if that&#39;s the case please ignore this post, I&#39;ll just have to live with it or use God mode.


Basically, the tentacle monster in Blast Pit behaves very differently than the one in the original game.

In the original throwing a grenade would distract the monster. 

If the player has not made any sounds for a while, the monster goes into a &#39;quiet&#39;, passive mode allow you to sneak around it in relative safety, using crouch, making the whole thing far less frustrating.

In Black Mesa. A grenade will sometimes distract the moster for a second or two, but not always. I&#39;ve noticed that at least one tentacle generally seems to keep on randomly smashing the ground where the player is regardless of actions. 

Lobbing a grenade from above causes the monster to retreat into the pit for a second or two, which at least gives me a chance to leg it, but when on the same elevation as the monster (on the ground floor) using the grenades is not particularly effective as the monster is not properly distracted.

Unlike the original Half Life, making no sound, and going into &#39;stealth mode&#39; by crouching has absolutely no effect on the tentacle monster; thus the only real way to get round it is to lob a grenade or two, hope for the best, and sprint round as fast as possible, hoping it doesn&#39;t land any hits. 

I found this largely to be a process of trial and error, and rather frustrating to play - loading and reloading until I could survive the run to the door.

Thank you.</description>

            <p>Grenades don’t hold their attention for very long. The trick is to throw grenades about every two seconds. Yes, the BM tentacles aren’t as predictable as the half-life ones.</p>
