    <title>White screen (menu, in-game)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/white-screen-menu-in-game/12111</link>
    <description>Hello, I`ve happened to encounter a problem: game menu is completely blank, although it seems to work (I`m able to start or quit the game).
My PC specs do match minimum system requirements, plus I`ve installed the game correctly.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance.</description>
