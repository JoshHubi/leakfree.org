    <title>Black Mesa 3-D</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-3-d/10775</link>
    <description>Hey there, I want to let those who enjoy Black Mesa that there is a way to play it in absolutely STUNNING 3-D. There is a free program out there, called IZ3D, that will take compatible games and allow you to play in several 3-D formats.
here is a link

to view in a mode other than Anaglyph ( traditional red/blue ) you have to select full install, and while it is a trial of the other formats, there is probably a way around it as they have discontinued licence distribution. I was able to use the side by side option to view on my LG cinema, but a standard monitor will still display Anaglyph. since black mesa is built on source it works with the program!
enjoy!</description>
