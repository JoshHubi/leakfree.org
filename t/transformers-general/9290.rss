    <description>I did a search for a Transformers general thread, and found none. Decided it should be time to make one, especially since Fall of Cybertron just got released.

So, how did you get into Transformers? Who&#39;s your favorite? Autobots or Decepticons?

I got started when I was little, like most. The series I grew up with were Armada and Energon. Stopped watching once Cybertron came around.</description>

            <p><em>NOTE:  Entire Transformers G1 cartoon series are on Netflix</em></p>
<p>I watched the original G1 Transformers when I was a teen.  I was too old for the toys, but the cartoons I thought were cool.  Transformers the Movie was good except for the part where Optimus Prime died.</p>
<p>The cartoons that came out after the movie…some were ok, but the ones that covered the return of Optimus were so riddled with continuity errors it was ridiculous.</p>

<p>My earliest memory of Transformers was the 1986 movie.  I’ve watched the original cartoon entirely, and I must say, it sucks.  It would have been awesome if I’d seen it as a kid, but now?  The movie holds up fine, but not the show.  I’ve watched a few of the shows between the original and the stuff now, and my favorite was probably Beast Wars.  The story, I thought, was very good, but I wish they expanded more on some of the little things, and ignored some of the bigger things they focused on.  Transformers Prime is also pretty good.  I haven’t watched any of season 2 yet, but season 1 was good.</p>
<p>From what I’ve seen trying to go back and watch the Unicron Trilogy, it sucks pretty hard.  Then again, the DVD releases were dumb and skipped a ton of episodes, and I don’t want to search for torrents for something that bad.</p>
<p>My favorites are the Constructicons (G1) and Dinobot (BW).</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, I kind of agree with you. Most of the Transformers series did suck, and it’s the nostalgia that makes people love them.</p>
<p>But it’s nostalgia that cannot be ignored.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
