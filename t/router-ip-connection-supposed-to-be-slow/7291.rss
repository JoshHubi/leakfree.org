    <title>Router IP connection supposed to be slow?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/router-ip-connection-supposed-to-be-slow/7291</link>
    <description>When I&#39;m trying to connect to my router&#39;s IP, is it normal that there&#39;s a 20-30 second delay on anything I do in there (initial connection, login, configuration, etc)? This kind of local connection should be instant, no?

I&#39;m asking because the local network here has been acting crazy lately. I used to be able to transfer files from my Mac to my PC at 10-11MB/s, but now that&#39;s at 1-2MB/s. The internet connection also dies for a minute or so every now and then.

So those things combined with the slow IP connection, leads me to believe that the router (D-Link DIR-615) might be broken, no?</description>

            <p>+1 on factory default or firmware update/re-install</p>
<p>Sounds like a malfunctioning router. Either caused by interference or it just being a crappy router. Many of them will just die after a while and start dropping connections, chopping packets, or constantly resetting. A total reset can prolong the life if it is the router acting up. (as well as flashing dd-wrt if supported) If you fear it may be outside inference check the signal to noise ratio. Most competent routers will have that stat some where in the administration panel.</p>

            <p>Well… i know what makes it slow. If you use a Mac, i know what to do. I had dropbox on and it was DLing games from steam at 200-300 KB/s, but when i turned it off, it became to be on 2MB/s, like usual, even up to 3MB/s. This really helped. So i guess turn off some  programs first.</p>

            <p>Unless you’ve done it already, you should try to reset to factory default…This usually does the trick.</p>

            <p>I rebooted the router when it happened again an hour or so ago and that seems to have fixed it, but I doubt it’ll be permanent… Considering I’ve rebooted it before to no avail.</p>
<p>Signal is fine and I doubt there’s some<span class="bbcode-i">thing</span> causing interference seeing as it was fine for months and only started happing around the beginning of April. And as far as some<span class="bbcode-i">one</span> goes, the only people close enough to cause interference are my direct neighbors, and both are near fossilized.</p>

            <p>try restarting.<br>
Is signal any good?</p>
<p>Maybe something (or someone) causes interference.</p>

            <p>It’s a hybrid router and the delay happens on either wired or wireless. When wireless, it is indeed secured.</p>
<p>The delay happens on other computers on the network as well, and as far as I’m aware, there aren’t any IP conflicts.</p>
<p>I should add that the delay doesn’t always manifest. Right now I can connect to the router just fine, but in an hour or so it could be slow again.</p>

            <p>That’s wireless? Check if no one else is connected to your router and eating your internetz. Make sure you set a secure encryption, and change the keys if needed.</p>
<p>If you’re only trying to connect wireless, try with an ethernet cable.</p>
<p>Maybe make sure there aren’t any IP conflicts on your local network.</p>
<p>The slowness appears on all the computers of the network?</p>
