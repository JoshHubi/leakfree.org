    <description>If you guys have not taken a look at the top 10 mods on ModDB yet, there is a mod called School Shooter : North Amercian Tour yada yada... Now im not complaining about the mod because of the whole, yeah teach kids its cool to shoot up a school, no people who do that are just mentally fucked and use games as an excuse. The whole idea these 2 morons have is just whats, plain stupid. They are adding into the game actual guns that were used in infamous school shootings, and thinking thats cool. Its disturbing, think about it, these were guns used by mentally fucked up people that have killed innocent students, and these guys are using it as entertainment. I know this mod will be taken down soon, but these guys, whether its a troll mod or not, are fucking stupid. Take a look for yourselves.

<p>It’s out of 1000, broseph…The highest score on youtube is 739 points, 1000 points being a perfect recreation. The developer actually offered a cash prize for the highest score when it was released, one source says this ended up being 780.</p>

<p>the point of JFK reloaded is to highlight the ridiculousness of the commonly accepted conspiracy theory that there was only one assassin.</p>
<p>the point of columbine simulators is to highlight how hip and edgy the kids who made the game are and maybe for emo kids to live out their revenge fantasies.</p>
<p>I don’t find either one offensive but I do find people who make columbine simulators dumb and probably deserving of their repressed social status. If you want to be hip and edgy, try making an 11-9 sim.</p>

</aside>
<p>Wait, what? I’m pretty sure it’s possible to get a 100 score in JFK Reloaded (ie, perfectly simulating the real event). And this, obviously, when you’re just one guy.</p>
<p>And I don’t know if anyone here ever played Super Columbine Massacre RPG, but it was very different from the name; it was actually pretty mature about its subject matter, and even had some analysis about what would lead someone to those actions. Heck, I think it’s safe to say the author didn’t want you to “enjoy” it like you would most games. I recommend you watch the trailer if you have the time:<br>

<p>i just read a comment that was posted an hour ago…</p>
<p>he does have a point, you could really use this to show what the kids go thru to make them snap, and feel that this is the only way to finish it. stop violence with extreme violence.</p>
<p>also, i’d like to point out. you can’t go on and say this mod is horrible, it’s killing innocent people! then go and play GTA, you have the opportunity to kill innocent people. judging from the screen shot, they didn’t model teenagers. they used the civilian models from HL2. Rename the mod and people will stop complaining.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That is actually a brilliant idea. Sure it’s not PC and is offensive, but it seems like it HAS to be done. It could even be used as an official evaluation tool for kids that may or may not be troubled.</p>

            <p>the point of JFK reloaded is to highlight the ridiculousness of the commonly accepted conspiracy theory that there was only one assassin.</p>
<p>the point of columbine simulators is to highlight how hip and edgy the kids who made the game are and maybe for emo kids to live out their revenge fantasies.</p>
<p>I don’t find either one offensive but I do find people who make columbine simulators dumb and probably deserving of their repressed social status. If you want to be hip and edgy, try making an 11-9 sim.</p>

            <p>I do not believe they were trying to rebuild the school, that WOULD get them tracked down and arrested. The only thing they were trying to rebuild for this was the weapons used by school shooters. Heres what I was looking for earlier that they had put in their description.</p>
<p>You decide to arm yourself with the exact same weapons as a previous school shooter such as; Eric Harris’ TEC-9, Dylan’s sawed-off shotgun, Seung-Hui Cho’s akimbo pistols, Nevada-Tan’s…box cutter?</p>
<p>Now that JFK game, I dont find that offending, a bit messd up yes, but I dont take that seriously. Especially since they used the <em>Its teaching people how to be an assassin</em> BS, because thats bullshit…</p>

            <p>as a kid from Colorado who currently is in his senior year of high school and goes to columbine high i fell i must point out a major fact:</p>
<p>that school looks nothing like the fucking school i go to. none of the hallways are right looks stupid.</p>
<p>as for the content. its just shock value kids looking for attention.  someone should point out to them that they have been beaten to the punch for a shock value game: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFK:_Reloaded" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFK:_Reloaded</a></p>
<p>p.s. i got 725/1000 anyone care to beat my score??? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>everybody who’s offended by this, grow the f*ck up. IT’S A GAME. so what if they’re trolling? oh well.</p>
<p>what’s wrong with making a mere simulation of killing people who are armed and shoot back? nothing, you say. what wrong with making a mere simulation of killing people who are unarmed? everything, you say. Just because of the circumstances.</p>
<p>yeah, it’s a shame that people were killed by maniacs who thought it would be funny/cool and these guys are putting it in a game (trololo), but isn’t it also a shame that big companies make games about killing people like terrorists which actually happens?</p>

            <p>I guess i’ll lay off this topic then, considering that I guess this is just based off of opinion. I guess I looked at this mod and figured it was fact that it is sick in the head to think its funny, or at all enjoyable. Some people need to take their heads out of the asses and look at the main reason why it is dumb to even do this. Its not the name I care about, its the ideas they have. Using weapons that were actually used in school shootings as if they were used by a hero. This is the description.</p>
<h1>A weapon loadout system based on 4 real-life spree killers.</h1>
<h1>13 brand-new fuckin’ weapons based on the weapons used by the aforementioned 4 spree killers, these will all be pain-stakingly modeled by one of our best (and probably only modeler), [NAME REDACTED].</h1>
<p>Its a joke to them…</p>

            <p>This mod is clearly just some idiots trying to do something provocative to upset people because they think it’s funny or cool (like HPN). Just ignore it and when they realize nobody cares they’ll give up and go back to listening to crappy screamo music.</p>
