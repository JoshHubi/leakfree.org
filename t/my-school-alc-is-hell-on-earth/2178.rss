    <title>My school ALC is hell on earth</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-school-alc-is-hell-on-earth/2178</link>
    <description>My entire school is a mad house because of the way the other students never listen to the teachers or that the fact that countless windows have been broken, a cabinet has been spray painted, they swear as if no one cares, they put hand sanitizer in the fish tank and killed some of the fish, they pull out their cell phones or Ipods and listen to rap ON FULL VOLUME while the teacher tries to give them answers they missed, they throw pencils and coins that have hit me about 50 times, almost all of them talk about getting stoned and getting drunk, they laugh when the biology teacher says anything about sexual reproduction of animals,and the worst thing is that they are 17, 18, and 19! But another annoying thing is that they act like 3-year-olds when they get their cell phone taken away for the school day.

And I am the only one that seems normal in that school and I&#39;m 15!
Does anyone else have a school like this? (But I doubt it :meh :slight_smile:</description>

<p>Haha! I love you.</p>
<p>Anyway, when I was at school my RE teacher (who was a vicar) had a student put window cleaner in his drink, he ended up in hospital. And I still don’t think mine was that bad.</p>

<p>Oh! speaking of spiking drinks, one of the students tried to put alcohol in the oldest teacher’s coffee ( Mr. Nesse or Phil) but Phil caught him and the bad thing is Phil is like 60-70 years old</p>

            <p>Hah! That reminds me of a small conversation between me and a pupil (I am an after-school-teacher). The student was constantly interrupting class and annoying the other two students, when I silently, with a lowered voice, asked him:</p>
<p>“Hey Billy (name changed for anonymity), do you possibly have a problem?”</p>
<p>Billy: “No, Sir?!”</p>
<p>I faced him and stared right into his eyes:<br>
“Maybe you want some?”</p>
<p>His gaze was priceless!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>English teachers are the one type of teacher who should always be able to control the class if they are any good. They are usually the people with skills at drama in my experience, but they should be able to control a class. Think of the witches in Terry Pratchet as an example, able to hold people steady and keep them quiet just with their voice. English teachers should be able to do the same thing (although maybe with a bit less skill than the witches  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ). Then again maybe I just had very good english teachers.</p>

<p>Besides hating people who pick up on punctuation on a molecular level, I think you can let him off if he can’t hear his teacher in English  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I went to state school, but over here a public school is a private school, so it can get a little bit confusing. It wasn’t too bad, and by the time I got to 6th form most of the idiots had left. I’m at university now, and as people have said, everyone wants to learn there (who wouldn’t at £3,000 a year)</p>
<p>My advice is just do the best you can. Its a mature attitude to take an interest in your education. As you move up through the school they should thin out a bit, but I’m afraid I’m not too sure on how the American education system works (over here you move up every year, but get sorted into ability groups)</p>

            <p>My high school was like that, but to a slightly less degree. The weird thing was it was a rural school, well on the outskirts of the nearby city. Thankfully I’m at a university now, where there are very few idiots like that.</p>

<p>hoo boy, small town high schools…just as bad as inner city high schools in their own right, IMO (I’ve gone to both). although i’m not sure if the purpose of this thread is simply anecdotal, or trying to spur some conversation about societal issues, so i guess i’ll take a step back</p>

            <p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: Dude, I’m so sorry that you have to be put in that environment. I know many kids at my school that would go so well in that school and do not belong at the school that I’m currently at. Just stay strong, man. If you fall to peer pressure then you’re worse then them. Don’t let it get to you, and you’ll be alright. Be sure to go to a nice university  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>My entire school is a mad house because of the way the other students never listen to the teachers or that the fact that countless windows have been broken, a cabinet has been spray painted, they swear as if no one cares, they put hand sanitizer in the fish tank and killed some of the fish, they pull out their cell phones or Ipods and listen to rap ON FULL VOLUME while the teacher tries to give them answers they missed, they throw pencils and coins that have hit me about 50 times, almost all of them talk about getting stoned and getting drunk, they laugh when the biology teacher says anything about sexual reproduction of animals,and the worst thing is that they are 17, 18, and 19! But another annoying thing is that they act like 3-year-olds when they get their cell phone taken away for the school day.</p>
<p>And I am the only one that seems normal in that school and I’m 15!<br>
Does anyone else have a school like this? (But I doubt it :meh <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
