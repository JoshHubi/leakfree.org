    <description>I bought Crysis Maximum edition when it was on sale for $13.59 on steam. My hardware set up has run crysis just fine on medium (it runs ok on high too, but the cut screens get choppy on high so I leave it on medium). I never had a problem with it until I got to the aircraft carrier and had to fend off the first wave of aliens that came in. The game kept crashing through the battle at different time intervals. I figured my system was just getting overtaxed by it, so I turned all the settings on low and played it again, but the sky was multicolored and the game still crashed. I changed the settings back to medium and the sky remained multicolored for the next several times I loaded it. So I just tried to get through it the best I could using F5 to quicksave often. I finally got through it, and made it through the entire ship without a real problem. When I came back up and the alien exosuit climbed up on ship, warped into the sky and then warped underneath the deck, and the game continued to crash often. The only way i had to beat it was to walk over to where the radar said it was and try to get it to grab me through the deck at which point the top of the unit would appear above deck where I could shoot it, and used F5 often. I essentially did the same again when the final battle on the ship occured. 

  Through all of this, I have changed my settings, restarted my computer, check to see if my system was running too hot, and installed the latest drivers for my video card. Nothing seems to work. 

So I moved on to Crysis Warhead. That game has run just fine on its medium equivalent, until I got to the hovercraft chase scene. The first time I played through that area I had no problem, but I died and when I came back everything was completely transparent except the ground and the shadows. I tried to load it on a much earlier save, and it is still transparent. I have since restarted my computer, checked to see if my system is again too hot, and changed the graphic settings. Nothing helps. Does anyone have any ideas?

            <p>I had the same problem, to fix it go to the steam games list, right click on crysis and select properties, then click on set launch options and put “-dx9” in the box</p>

            <p>You can force the game to run in windowed mode at a lower resolution to keep your HD, etc (I use a vanilla copy and it doesn’t crash for me, I guess that’s because I’m using DX9 not 10).</p>
<p>It sounds like there are too many entities for the game engine to handle in DX10 so the engine crashes. I don’t know how, you might want to figure out a way to reduce the entity count. Just a thought.</p>

            <p>Assassin, My brother reccomended me turning my game resolution down (my native resolution is 1680x1050) and when I did almost all the problems cleared up. I still crash on the ship quite a bit, but I’m just happy that its not extremely bugged. Who would of thought that the ingame resolution affected so much?</p>

            <p>Im sorry, but people have had problems in those places.<br>
You can try to repair the installation, but likely youll have to uninstall reinstall. Backup your game data through steam and slap your save games back in the folder when youre done.</p>
<p>If you want the game to run better, I have spent much time tweaking it. See my sig.</p>
