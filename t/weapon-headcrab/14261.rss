    <title>weapon_headcrab?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weapon-headcrab/14261</link>
    <description>So playing around in game files as I often do, I stumbled upon weapon_headcrab, which upon picking up your screen gets blocked and you&#39;re damaged over time as a headcrab screams at you until you hit attack, where upon you throw the headcrab off of yourself. Sadly, the screen blocking effects [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/id/sagejfox/screenshot/450706892979132437&#39;]are missing[/url]. Does a dev happen to know what material path that it&#39;s supposed to use?

Would love to have it working if not just for the novelty. Could see it used in a zombie gamemode maybe,  in a custom SP level/campaign somewhere along [url=&#39;https://youtu.be/wtIp8jOo8_o?t=1m36s&#39;]these lines[/url], or have a chance of happening when attacked by a headcrab, as seemed to be the original purpose of it.</description>

            <p>I believe this is from an old game mechanic where ingame headcrabs could attach to you just like in the benson trailer, I think it was going to be used for the hard difficulty but was removed, though I do wonder if it will be implemented again.</p>
