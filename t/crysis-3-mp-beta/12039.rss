    <title>Crysis 3 MP BETA</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crysis-3-mp-beta/12039</link>
    <description>Anyone played this yet?

Highly unimpressed. Poor level design, unbalanced weapons, poor upgrade and &#39;perk&#39; system.

Added to that the general &#39;feel&#39; of the game just feels terrible. Sure it looks good, but clearly graphics don&#39;t make for a decent game.

I realise this is supposed to be a BETA, but nowadays that&#39;s just tactical talk for demo, creating the false idea that the final product will be better.

Honestly I just can&#39;t seem to find anything to like about it. The fact they&#39;ve actually given cloak and armor their separate energy pools is just beyond pathetic. Clearly this is yet another sign of dumbing down games for the idiot crowd. Christ, one of the starting &#39;perks&#39; automatically turns your armor on when your being fired at.

Will be renting for the SP as I&#39;ve always enjoyed them, shame they haven&#39;t got the multiplayer right [i]again[/i]. Honestly it&#39;s basically Crysis 2 with a few upgrades, and they aren&#39;t well done in the slightest, to the point that they actually detract from the game.</description>

            <p>I remember seeing a couple of those low-end configs back when I had a shit computer, but I haven’t actually looked in years, and the forum that most of them were on was changed so much that I’d imagine they’d be buried pretty deep unless they were updated a little while ago.</p>

            <p>So, this seems like a semi-appropriate place to ask…</p>
<p>Does anyone happen to know where I can get a config for Crysis 1 that’ll improve performance? I understand that they can make a huge difference but I’m having trouble finding one that seems appropriate for a lower-end system, rather than just “MAXIMUM GRAPHICS”.</p>

            <p>yeah, they sold it like it was gonna be a Mirrors Edge shooter with a nanosuit and Crysis 1 sized maps, but it ended up being a corridor shooter with really thick corridors.</p>
<p>I’m getting the feelings that these maps are built more like Halo style arena maps with lots of paths that go in circles around a bigger fighting area. It’s a decent compromise, but still. I want to snipe from the high ground and watch stupid ass AI run for the wrong side of cover–well, I don’t want that. I can play Crysis 1 for that. What I do want is a Crysis game that lets you breathe again. I guess we just have to wait till the next generation of console hardware for Crytek to feel safe enough to tackle that experience.</p>

            <p>Definitely agree, one of the main things that annoyed me is when people would say CRYENGINE3 IS CONSOLIFIED LOOKS LIKE SHIT CRYENGINE 2 WAS MUCH BETTER</p>
<p>Cryengine 3 is fucking Cryengine 2 with more features, just because Crysis 2 didn’t make the most of the engine doesn’t make the engine worse then the predecessor.</p>
<p>On the topic of Crysis 2, I didn’t dislike the game for being in a city, but rather that it was <span class="bbcode-i">so much god damn wasted potential.</span> They showed the early footage and I was pumped because it seemed like it was going to be an open-ended game like C1 but in a city, and that was exciting because there were possibilities to have the player climb buildings, scope out an area, then jump off and execute his plans - it just seemed like such a great way to make Crysis different while keeping what made it good the same, but instead if turned out to be a bunch of scripted events with little areas where you could sort of choose what to do.</p>
<p>I’d say the one thing that really made me hope for that was in the alpha footage in a segment that I can’t seem to find, where they showed the player jumping off of a giant building and landing on glass (the glass cracked) and surviving. It just could have been <span class="bbcode-i">so awesome</span></p>

<p>Crysis 1 had niche looks. It mostly just looked good because of the choice of environment and the motion blur  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>You try to build anything but a jungle in CE2 though… Prepare to vomit.</p>
<p>Cryengine 3 is shitloads more flexible and Crysis 2/3 (more 3) proves it by juggling amazing looking vegetation and amazing looking inorganic environments. Crysis 2’s human models/ facial animations were a bit ghastly though. The god awful ‘The Room’ tier voice acting didn’t help. Crysis 3 more than rectifies this. Psycho looks fucking amazing. Fat jokes aside, this is one of the best looking videogame characters I’ve ever seen. If the guy who’s doing his voice/ facial work is who I think it is (Charlie from Uncharted 3/ Bald racist dude from the last Rambo film) then his performance is going to be top tier as well… assuming the vocal directors aren’t out on break during the whole duration of the game’s production this time. Seriously though, I want Crysis 1 with Crysis 3’s vegetation physics and wind simulation… and caustics…</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PTs-KtzlXc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">not-quite-on-topic-but-closer-to-topic-than-before</a></p>
<p>I like the look of these seph more than the Crysis 2 guys. Why do they still have that stupid ass pause where the blood explodes out of them a second after you actually shoot them?</p>

            <p>People overestimate Crysis’ graphics. Yeah, it looks amazing for a game from 2007 and still holds up well today but it is starting to show its age and there’s a lot of places that look pretty bad. I wish a game comes out soon that is so far ahead that it replaces Crysis as the game people say is the best looking ever so people will stop bringing it up in arguments about graphics.</p>

<p>The indoor areas were mostly a by-product of CE2, that engine was without a doubt, <span class="bbcode-i">complete shit</span> for indoor spaces. It took the best mappers loads of effort to make a presentable indoor space and they usually used a lot of tricks to do it, and I absolutely hated that about it because it took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBChb6kxKuw" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">a lot of tweaking in CE2 for indoor stuff that ended up looking mediocre</a> while it didn’t even take that much on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pQtHuGeCTQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">CE3 to make something that looked really cool</a>.</p>
<p>I’m honestly surprised the Core level with no gravity looks as good as it does, it was probably the only good looking indoor setting on that engine.</p>

</aside>
<p>I was really hoping for that as well, and on top of that unless you force AA through the control panel for Crysis 1 the game has no AA that works on transparency objects which wouldn’t be a problem if it wasn’t <span class="bbcode-i">3/4ths the game’s graphics.<br>
</span><br>
Problem is the forced TSAA runs like shit too.</p>

            <p>Nah, I agree about that.</p>
<p>I’m just pissed that they tried way too hard for “realistic” AI and ended up with a bloated system with too many moving parts that broke too easily. Player feedback is kinda halfassed too since no one seems to react to being shot until they’re on the ground.</p>

            <p>To me, their outdoor areas were just beautiful to look at. I can see enough of the city by looking outside. It seems that our reasons for liking one or the other are the same; you’re used to an island atmosphere, I’m used to a city atmosphere, and we each find that boring.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, could someobody please explain to me what is considered so bad about its SP campaign? Open world gameplay with natural borders (mountains, water) that didn’t make me feel constricted in the least, as well as countless possible approaches to the missions.</p>
<p>I will admit, though, everything after (and including) the no-gravity levels kind of went downhill.</p>

            <p>Maybe I’m jaded to it because I lived close to the coast of Kenya for two years and always went to the beach. Crysis’s look is boring as fuck to me. It should bring me feelings of nostalgia, but nope. Just “meh, been there.” The fact that it’s merely a 2007 (though top tier) approximation doesn’t help either. It all falls apart when I get to interiors though. Crysis 1’s indoor areas were ugly even when the game was fresh.</p>
<p>As for Crysis 2 and 3… as grey as they are, they’re physically impossible (or at least improbable) spaces for the most part. Much more interesting to me personally. Plus the indirect lighting makes everything better. What I’d really love is Crysis 1 ported to the Crysis 3 build of Cryengine 3.</p>

            <p>Crysis’s art direction was basically:</p>
<p>“hey, you know that thing you see when you look through a window?”<br>
“reality?”<br>
“yeah, let’s imitate that.”<br>
“fine, whatevs”</p>

            <p>Crysis 2 looks and plays like shit and Crysis 3, from my time playing it, looks even shittier.</p>
<p>Crysis 1 was (and still is) one of the most fun games I’ve ever played. Fuck the general consensus, its gameplay, art direction and visuals in general are STILL above anything I’ve ever seen. I’m just so sick of boring gray buildings and so far the Crysis sequels have delivered just that.</p>
<p>*I know Crysis 3 sp hasn’t come out yet but the rehashed mp from Crysis 2 doesn’t leave me hopeful for any drastic changes</p>
<p>**Mad props to the Crysis 3 animators though, jumping on stuff and navigating the map is extremely fluid. The only good thing about it so far.</p>
