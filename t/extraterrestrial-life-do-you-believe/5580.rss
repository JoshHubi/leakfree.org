    <title>Extraterrestrial life: do you believe?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/extraterrestrial-life-do-you-believe/5580</link>
    <description>Pretty straightforward topic, do you believe that there is intelligent life in other planets?

Do you believe that they come regularly to our planet to check out on us and even experiment on us?

Do you think the SETI program will ever find what they&#39;re looking for?

My stance on this is &quot;see it to believe it&quot; but I can&#39;t agree with the notion that in all of this huge, possibly infinite, universe, we may be the only intelligent beings.</description>

<p>The Savannas of Africa weren’t always savannas. At the time when our species started evolving from our common ancestors with the shimpanzees and bonobos, the area where there are savannas today was mainly covered with flooded rain forests.  At least that is what I read in a book about the theory of evolution. Fossil evidence has disproved the theory that our human brains and senses evolved in a sort of “training process” in the savannas of Africa, where we had to learn to survive in a hostile environment full of predators and their ideal cover (high grass, etc). Because there were no savannas in Africa at that time.</p>
<p>I am not sure whether the exact time period was mentioned, though. Whether it was 4 million years or more, I cannot say. Don’t have the book here any more, had to bring it back to the library.</p>

<p>According to Walking with Beasts, 4 millions years ago the forests were turning into Savannas and the overall fauna was very similar to what we have today, with the exception of the Ancylotherium, Dinofelis, Deinotherium (though this one isn’t too different, and of course our ancestors, Australopithecus.</p>

</aside>
<p>Earth climate is changing over and over again, so it’s very likely that Savanna occurred more that once in Africa in the past million of years… Which doesn’t change the fact that we can only guess how the environment of early humans looked like.</p>

            <p>Nope, I just read too much. My wife’s worse; she can speed-read a standard paperback novel in about 4 hours, and recall about 90% of it. Our bookshelves rival some small-town libraries.</p>
<p>Doesn’t help that I remember debating this topic (the possibility of non-organic life) with friends when I was in 5th grade. I was one of those kids that tended to skew grading curves.</p>

The only time we’ve seen examples of environments with liquid water that don’t wind up with something living – even just single-cell organisms – they’re totally sterile, and even then it tries to happen anyway.</p>
<p>Astronomers recently <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11710-goldilocks-planet-may-be-just-right-for-life.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed the presence</a> of a planet sitting right in the center of the ‘Goldilocks zone’: not too hot, not too cold. If that planet also has liquid water in any amount, the chance of it having some form of life (the way we define it) is pretty high.</p>
<p>Sci-fi enthusiasts will happily point out that there’s the possibility for something other than plants and animals to develop consciousness and sentience, and could therefore be considered ‘alive’. I don’t think it’s unfeasible to consider that something might be out there that’s self-aware, but inorganic, or even lacking a physical form.</p>
<p>Until we actually run into something like that, all we really have as a reliable model is what we see every day.</p>

            <p>I hope that this isn’t incredibly stupid but it’s something I’ve never understood. I always hear that water is necessary for life and stuff like that but wouldn’t it be possible to have life without it? With how large the universe is you’d think it’d be possible for other forms of “life” to exist without water.</p>

            <p>Animals can survive in the wild despite a lack of much intelligence because they have other things to help them survive. Animals that learn things have intelligence, like that bear.</p>
<p>Yes, humans used to be able to survive without intelligence. Then they involved to be more intelligent and started taking over the world.</p>
<p>A decrease in population is not absolutely necessary for a mutation to spread. If a mutation is beneficial and increases chances of survival it can cause an increase in population instead of requiring a decrease.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t know how that relates to my post. My point was that a lot of animals aren’t as intelligent as humans and despite that they are able survive in the wild. And yes, a lot of animals need to be taught certain things to survive, unless you are telling me that a bear raised in captivity could do something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-g8TO9LJ1c" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> when released into wild.</p>

<p>All these examples are shit. Animals live in a suitable environment because they wouldn’t be living there if it wasn’t suitable. If the environment changes enough the species will either go extinct or adapt to the environment through evolution.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Primitive humans MUST have lived in some environment, so it’s logical that there must have been an environment suitable for not-so-intelligent humans in the past. People have no fur so it’s also logical that they must have lived in a warm climate, preferably rich in food - in that case a subtropical climate suits well, and Mediterranean one even better. I also remind that according to studies our intelligence came AFTER our physical appearance. You can’t fight with logic.</p>

<p>And if the environment doesn’t change, evolution will also occur, which means that evolution doesn’t need environmental change.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Any evidence to back up your claim? My reasoning goes as follows: you need to reduce the size of a population in order to make the mutations more likely (reduced genetic pool) and allow for the mutated individuals to compete with non-mutated ones. Change of the environment in most cases leads to reduction of the size of a population, so, as a results, change of the climate triggers the evolution.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, so? I only presented my own opinion, that people would be able to survive in the wild in a suitable climate even if we hadn’t got a superior intelligence to other animals. I’ve never said that we would be as numerous as we are now. The basic role of the evolution is to prevent extinction, so we haven’t evolved just to make our life easier.</p>
