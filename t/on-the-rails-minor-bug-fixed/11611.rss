    <description>Bug description: Train&#39;s physics fail
Bug location: C2a2a; The train elevator.

How to recreate bug: Simply save the game WHILE Freeman is currently &quot;using&quot; the train&#39;s speed controller. Load the game, and press up. One or both of these effects may occur:

- Freeman falls down, passing through the elevator&#39;s floor and into the floor below.

- The train gets stuck in midair, as shown in the screenshot.

Odd bug, but at least it&#39;s a bit funny to see the physics fail.</description>
