This lighting issue seems to happen every time there&#39;s a dynamic light that&#39;s supposed to be switched on, like the fire that gets switched on by the valve in Apprehension or this fire that starts when all the explosive crates explode in Power Up.  The light doesn&#39;t actually appear until I save the game and load a save where the light is already supposed to be on.</description>
