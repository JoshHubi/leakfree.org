    <title>IDE 40 pin cable</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ide-40-pin-cable/4937</link>
    <description>I have one of [url=&#39;https://img691.imageshack.us/img691/9423/dsc00620mv.jpg&#39;]these[/url], and I want to open it up. I&#39;m making a 40-pin to 44-pin ide adapter. My problem is that I can&#39;t get the 40-pin cable open to get at the individual wires. How could I get at them?
Sersoft, I&#39;m looking at you, I think I remember you saying you did something similar before.</description>

            <p>Sounds like you are making a cable so that you can put your 2½" laptop drive on your 3½" controller in your PC, that is trickier than you might think as the extra 4 cables are power, if memory serves, so you need to know exactly how to power that (I sure don’t), if this is the case you are better off with a 15 dollar USB case for 2½ inch drives…</p>
<p>Anyway to get to the cables the easiest way should be to pry off the head as isaac mentions, otherwise you need to cut the cable and clear off the rubber coating manually with some tools.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>Can’t you pry off the blue head?</p>
<p>I can’t be too much help here, but just for information’s sake, how are you going to turn it into a 44 pin adapter? Are there some wires from the 44-pin that are unneeded?</p>
