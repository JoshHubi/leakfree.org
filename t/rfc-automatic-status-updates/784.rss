    <title>RFC: Automatic Status Updates?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rfc-automatic-status-updates/784</link>
    <description>Just a thought, and not sure how useful/wanted it&#39;d be anyway, but how useful would it be to put somewhere some output from SVN showing when the last checkin was, to keep people happy that things are still progressing?

Seems like something like that is relatively easy to implement (crontab/scheduled task to poll the SVN repository semi-regularly and output to a text file that the website can pull from)...

I&#39;m thinking this might avoid or at least reduce the posts about the lack of recent updates on the site, while not actually giving anything secret away.

Another thought along this line is an output of the number of open issues in the issue-tracker, tho that might be a little more on the nose (and also a little more like a countdown-to-release...)

Anyway, RFC...</description>

<p>Given that the devs do not like to release any kind of information about who’s working on what and which parts of the game are complete, I doubt this will happen.</p>

</aside>
<p>I didn’t mean it to include any of the who or what, just the when (or in the case of the latter idea, just the count and a last-updated).</p>
