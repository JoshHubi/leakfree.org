            <p>I know several supposedly full-screen effects are actually locked at a 4x3 aspect ratio. I made a thread about <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=13053" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the shotgun not shading past a line</a> where a 4x3 rectangle would end on my 16x9 monitor, so I’m thinking this has something to do with it.</p>
<p>I’d say, if you’re messing with resolutions, try different aspect ratios. Specifically, see if it works at 4x3</p>

            <p>At least it is now known that messing with quality settings and screen resolution allows to workaround the problem for some people. My suggestion to people who are still struggling with this is to keep on trying with different quality and resolutions.</p>
<p>What to change at a first place: HDA None/Full, shadow details low/middle/high, models detail low/middle/high, texture detail low/middle/high, water details l/m/h/ and so on.<br>
Yep, it’s a lot of trial and efforts but chances are in the end you would be able to continue playing.</p>

<p>Ok heres a new update for all of you trying to pass the level on blast bit.  when you walk down the ladder and it says loading and crashes but i have seem to fixed it. its not really fix but it works if your resolution is higher then 1280x720 it crashes but soon you put your resolution to 1280x720 it works fine for me it did for me i hope this helps. this is temporary till the developers fix it but im so happy i can continue with the game.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  heres picture of it not great as i need to re install fraps but it will do ok bare with me i just tried to continue and its just died i will see witch resolution to confirm to pass that level now</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Crashes:</span><br>
Every time the game crashes, it will create an <span class="bbcode-b">MDMP</span> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">minidump</a>) file in your <span class="bbcode-b">SteamApps\username\source sdk base 2007 folder</span>.</p>
<p>Your crash will be the newest entry in that folder. If you attach the file to your report, it will help us track down and solve the issue.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Attach the minidump file in another post, so that hopefully the developers will have a look at it.</p>
