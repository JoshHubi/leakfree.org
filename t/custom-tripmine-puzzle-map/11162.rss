    <title>Custom Tripmine puzzle map</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/custom-tripmine-puzzle-map/11162</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I recently made a speedrun video for the tripmine puzzle in this [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14384&#39;]thread.[/url]

And I decided rather than continuously improving my time in that tripmine puzzle, I would just make my own tripmine puzzle map.

I&#39;ve started by drawing a sketch of the first floor of the tripmine puzzle. I plan to add another, but I haven&#39;t drawn it yet.

(I photoshopped the image a little for better visability)

Now, I haven&#39;t actually drawn the placements for the actual tripmines, as you can see, and am just working on getting the initial structure down. I have started working this into hammer, but its not ready to show off yet.

I would like to receive constructive criticism for what I have shown so far and maybe some ideas to add.

The map flows as follows: Player spawns. Player can either enter ventilation system to his right, or head down the hallway(where there are tripmines). If player heads down the hallway, player will be greeted with a doorway at the bottom of stairs or can continue down the hallway and break the windows by the locked door at the end of the hallway. The power is off. Player must navigate through tripmines in a dim lit room with only windows as light source to the powerswitch(located in power room bottom right in sketch) Once player restores the power, player will be able to see better and can progress to the floor below via the elevator in the middle.</description>

            <p>Heh, just please-please-please try to map more efficiently / less demanding than the Black Mesa tripmine map! My framerate really suffered in there! Upsize some textures and keep the props simple!</p>
<p>Then cram as many lasers in as you can. Maybe try some at non-perpendicular angles.</p>
