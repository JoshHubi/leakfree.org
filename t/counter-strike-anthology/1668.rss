    <title>Counter Strike Anthology</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/counter-strike-anthology/1668</link>
    <description>I bought said title above retail. It stated at the steam store that it would include Day Of Defeat. However, when I activated it, I only got CS, CS: CZ + DS, Ricochet and Deathmatch classic. There was no Day of Defeat. Are the retail packages like this? Please help. 
Thanks.</description>

            <p>I’m guessing they wont give it to you because…it’s not part of the package deal you bought? From a quick search there is a difference between the CS Anthology package and other package deals which include other Source games.</p>

            <p><em>sigh</em> They replied again. They said I got the E- Club (Malaysian) Version, so I will not get Day Of Defeat.<br>
It’s unfair! I pay just as much for an inferior product.<br>
What is up with them?!</p>

            <p>Well, I’ve been waiting for 2 days. Steam hasn’t responded.<br>
But the guy who got DoD:S for free gives me hope.<br>
EDIT: I got a reply. Damn Steam isn’t giving me what I wanted.</p>

<p>Yeah, but you don’t need to buy it alone on retail. Just buy the Counter Strike Anthology and then buy Counter Strike: Source to compare and contrast the two games.</p>

            <p>The retail game that he bought is called Counter Strike Anthology. The complete Counter Strike Complete Pack that you’re talking about, Mangled, is only on Steam. The only other Counter Strike game that you can get at a retail store is Counter Strike: Source. The rest of the CS stuff is available only on Steam.</p>
