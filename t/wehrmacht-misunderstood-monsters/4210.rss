    <title>WEHRMACHT: Misunderstood Monsters?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wehrmacht-misunderstood-monsters/4210</link>
    <description>There seems to be a rather extensive fan club of the wehrmacht here that borders [i]holocaust denial[/i], so i thought i&#39;d set things straight and give a more balanced presentation of those good ol&#39; boys of yore that you guys seem so fond of. 

A list of the atrocities committed by the Wehrmacht.

[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht[/url]

heres a couple smidgens:
[quote]
[b]Mass rapes[/b]

Rapes were committed by Wehrmacht forces on women and girls during the Invasion of Poland.[4]

Rapes were also committed against Polish women and girls during mass executions carried out primarily by the Selbstschutz, which were accompanied by Wehrmacht soldiers and on territory under the administration of the German military; the rapes were done before shooting female captives.[9]

Szymon Datner, Polish-Jewish communist and former partisan, asserted, thousands of Soviet female nurses, doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured during the war, and often had been murdered afterwards.[10]

The Wehrmacht also ran brothels where women were forced to work.[11][12] Ruth Seifert in War and Rape. Analytical Approaches writes: &quot;in the Eastern territories the Wehrmacht used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women - and other women as well - with the words &quot;Whore for Hitler&#39;s troops&quot; and to use them accordingly.&quot;[11]

The OKW was aware of the problem and urged to preserve the army’s credit. A soldier who committed a rape, and who was subsequently discovered to have and court-martialed, was usually convicted to four years of prison.[13] The German penal code was also valid for the soldiers in war.[14]
[/quote]
they just happened to be there! 
[quote]
[b]Invasion of Poland[/b]
See also: Częstochowa massacre

Wehrmacht units killed thousands of Polish civilians during the 1939 September campaign through executions and terror bombing of cities. After the end of hostilities, during the Wehrmacht&#39;s administration of Poland, which went on until October 25, 1939, 531 towns and villages were burned, and the Wehrmacht carried out 714 mass executions, alongside mass incidents of plunder, banditry and murder. Altogether, it is estimated that 16,376 Poles fell victim to those atrocities. [COLOR=&#39;Yellow&#39;]Approximately 60% of these crimes were committed by the Wehrmacht.[3] Wehrmacht soldiers frequently engaged in massacres of Jews on their own rather than just assist in rounding up Jews for the SS.[4] In the summer of 1940, Reinhard Heydrich, the chief of the Reich Main Security Office (including the Gestapo) noted that &quot;compared to the crimes, robberies and excesses committed by the army (Wehrmacht), the SS and the police don&#39;t look all that bad&quot;.[5]

waitaminnit, they don&#39;t sound so smallfry after all! sounds like someone&#39;s grampa has been feeding them lies and &quot;enhanced&quot; truths.

well gosh, I&#39;m curious as to what all of the Wehrmacht fanboys have to say about all this.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>i wonder why the topic were called “Wehrmacht” - the hitler era was from end of WW I to the end of WW II, and it wasn’t only the “Wehrmacht”, it was also the SS and the GESTAPO. .</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The topic is about how much blame the German armed forces recieved for their actions. The SS and Gestapo were unquestionably the stereotyped Nazis.</p>

            <p>I agree. It’s only that it was full of disgusting characters (except the women - and maybe the French man at the beginning, he was just a poor sod) and extreme brutality. I said it was hard to swallow (for me at least), not that it wasn’t awesome.</p>

</aside>
<p>no, i served at the german airforce, and nobody from my comrades and me were nazis. a nazi is just a stupid rassist who has nothing in his head, is too lazy to work and just drinks alcohol and fights people that are not white or their color and uses drugs - just stupid these people are. here’s more about that shit:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism</a></p>
<p>i wonder why the topic were called “Wehrmacht” - the hitler era was from end of WW I to the end of WW II, and it wasn’t only the “Wehrmacht”, it was also the SS and the GESTAPO. but the rassism itself (for example the anti semitism with the jewish people started a few hundred years ago) is much older and today the problem is in USA or other countries much stronger than in germany. here in germany when it’s parliamentary elections for the Bundestag only a few people (a not important number) vote the national socialism party and there are even no more much of them left - and this is good, hope there will be no more partys like this in the future.</p>
<p>so i would confirm what you’ve asked: it’s a worldview that someone has, regardless of the uniform.</p>

</aside>
<p>No doubt, but it kind of disproves the claim that simply joining the Wehrmacht during the reign of Hitler automatically turns you into a “Nazi”.  I’m sure that there were honest-to-god Nazis in the Wehrmacht but I’m also sure that there were many that simply joined because they were forced to.</p>

<p>Probably those on these boards that had/have relatives that served under the Wehrmacht during Hitler’s reign and said something like “My grandfather wasn’t a monster, he was a German that happened to be in the army at the time”.</p>
<p>Ballsopt here is telling those people that their grandfather was a monster and a rapist because he was in the Wehrmacht.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>that’s bullshit… my grandfather also served for the wehrmacht. if he didn’t served, they had killed him. nobody had a choice at this time - it was the same for everyone. the only choice was: follow Hitler or get killed. my grandpa was gone in english war captivity - he had a much better life there compared to be a german soldier. and he got something to eat!</p>
