    <title>Choosing an MP3 Player</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/choosing-an-mp3-player/7163</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve had an iPod Video for quite a few years and feel like getting a new mp3 player. At first I was looking at [url=&#39;https://www.cowonglobal.com/product_wide/COWONS9/product_page_5.php&#39;]this[/url]  and it&#39;s pretty much perfect for what I want to do. The only problem is  that it only comes with 32 GBs of memory which is smaller than I would  like. I&#39;ve started looking into getting [url=&#39;https://www.cowonglobal.com/product_wide/COWONX7/product_page_4.php&#39;]this[/url]  one which has a giant hard drive and pretty much the same features as  the previous one. It is a little larger than the iPod video that I have  though. Each of these seem to have a downside to them. 

Now, can anyone suggest any mp3 players that have similar features to  the ones I posted but are relatively small compared to them? Also if  possible I&#39;d like to be able to get onto the internet using it but  that&#39;s not necessary.</description>

            <p>Wow. Cowon seems to be amazing. I think I’ll be getting the J9 or whatever they decided to call it.</p>

            <p>Okay so I got the Cowon X7 and am listening with the earbuds that came with it and I am amazed, AMAZED, at how good it sounds. Much better than the iPod that I had before. Glad I got this one. I can’t even imagine the quality with high quality earbuds/headphones.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow I just went through a few of the effects. Mind=blown.</p>

            <p>ha I have recommend the COWONS9 to everyone, funny that some one finally starts with it. I don’t have one my elf (would like to) but the think has unbeatable audio quality and styling. Also COWON have released the OS source files and can be edited using adobe flash so you can make the interface look and work however you want. But yes, the locked storage is a downside.</p>
<p>As for bit rates and file formats FLAC is unnecessary. In numerous blind tests most people cant tell the difference between 192 and lossless. Also many self proclaimed audiophiles couldn’t consistently tell apart 256 and lossless (let alone 320).</p>

            <p>Well the mp3 player itself has a bunch of effects for audio, that’s what I was talking about anyway.</p>
<p>Edit: Also as far as I know iPods don’t support AVI video and it’s a pain in the ass for my to convert it.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Also the one I’m thinking of getting has radio too.</p>
<p>One more edit: Also 103 hours of continuous music play holy shit.</p>

            <p>I’d think a decent quality (320) mp3 would be sufficient, that’s what I like my music at. What I’m saying is, flac compatibility isn’t really something I’d concentrate on.</p>

            <p>I have never used that type of file to my knowledge. And yeah I’d like to get as high quality sound as I can and I’ve read a lot of reviews saying that the sound quality is incredible. I wouldn’t call myself an audiophile but I’d like having the effects  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  .</p>

            <p>Well it sounds like you like high quality sound, do you need it to be capable of playing FLAC? I know some people have problems with how much space it takes up.</p>

            <p>The thing attracting me to the ones that I posted were those effects for the audio. I don’t have any particular need for the apps on an iPod touch so. And I’m mostly going to use it for music but I may put a few videos here and there on it.</p>
<p>Plus both of the ones I listed have a note taking thing, a calculator, and can read text files and other document files and stuff.</p>
<p>I don’t particularly have a budget but $300 is probably the upper limit of what I’d like to spend, the one I’m looking at the most is about $285.</p>
<p>Also I’d like other suggestions besides iPods  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  .</p>

            <p>Yeah if you need more than 64 GB, get an iPod Classic. If 64 GB is enough, iPod Touch. Not only is the Touch an awesome MP3 player, you also have the internet and basically any other app you could imagine.</p>

            <p>Ipod touch? Haha, you knew you were gonna hear it, the mic is astounding on the touch, and inter webs is nice, theres even a remote desktop app. I’ve used it to cheat on all kinds of tests. I recommend that but you haven’t stated a budget.</p>
