        <title>Official Gears of War 4: Judgement Trailer</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[k3nny1550]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What, you mean when [color=black]Tai blows his face off with a shotgun and Dom’s wife is found in an alien Iron Maiden?</p>
<p>Those scenes never got to me at all. Marcus and Dom never felt like relatable characters to me. The reason Gears 1 worked for me was because it was more about Sera, the planet, and how absolutely fucked up of a place it was to live. You had scenes with the Stranded, showing their terrible living conditions. All the streets are torn to shit, immulsion plants lay abandoned. [color=black]The Fenix mansion lies abandoned in ruins, destroyed further when the Locust track Delta Squad there. Fenix’s character more or less took everything in stride. I mean, when [color=black]Carmine takes a bullet to the face in the first game, about the only thing the Gears have to say for it is “[color=black]Carmine. Shit.”</p>
<p>Marcus, as a leader, obviously has to keep a lot of his emotions in check to effectively run Delta Squad, particularly after [color=black]Kim bites it. But you never really see him as anything other than an ex-con meathead kicking ass on the battlefield. He doesn’t really have any kind of moments where you see the crazy internals of the character burst forth. You don’t get any scenes like Max Payne losing his shit in drug trips or Shepard confiding in a squad member close to him about his own insecurities. None of that shit, says Marcus. We have Locust to kill. Which works for a while- I still find Gears 1 to be a lot of fun. But when Dom bitches about his wife throughout half of game 2 constantly, it’s completely fucking ham-fisted. It doesn’t have any kind of subtlety to it at all; it just feels like it’s there to stop fanfic writers from writing gay sex scenes between the members of Delta Squad. A saving throw from the author saying DOM’S NOT GAY FUCK ALL OF YOU, despite how the achievements in the first game actively played this up a bit (“I Can’t Quit You Dom,” anyone?)</p>
<p>I’m not saying that Gears has to bog itself down in nine hours of cutscenes like a Metal Gear game- I just wish there was a little depth to these characters. The only mention of Dom’s wife was a very passing mention in game 1 when Delta visits the Stranded camp. The little things like that are great- they’re hinting at these guys being people, rather than just an effective alien slaying squad. Stories about Cole’s thrashball games and their effects on people gave some pretty funny moments in the game as well, but you don’t see Cole running around saying he misses his ball playing days constantly. Because if that happened it would just feel too ham-handed and go from a character trait to an audience ear canal irritant.</p>
<p>[color=black]Tai’s bit with the shotgun just came out of nowhere, like it was the game trying to be dark and poignent. If it had been one of the original Delta Squad going batshit instead of some one-off for game 2, the scene would have had more impact- you’d get that these guys are really tightly wound, and prone to snapping at any time due to the desperate situation they’re in. As is, they don’t really work on any dramatic level for me. When I play a Gears game, I’m inherently disconnected from the narriative. I love the art style, the combat is well designed, the cinematography is pretty good at times, etc. but I can’t connect with any character in the series. There’s just not enough to work with. The hints dropped about Marcus’ trial never really turn into anything coherent. We never get to see any of it, and it never really feels relevant to anything in the story. Conservation of detail, it seems, is somewhat of the culprit here.</p>
<p>Compare to Max Payne 3, where they manage to make a series in-joke <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci3rITTD8rU&amp;feature=related" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">into something almost beautiful.</a></p>

<p>Yes…?  Which led to one of the most gut-wrenchingly emotional moments in video gaming I can think of.</p>

            <p>maybe its just me but gears has always rubbed me the wrong way… it seems way to much of a bro game with just a bunch of puffed up meat heads shooting guns… nothing spectacular gameplay wise, and story is a bit lacking… nothing really creative from this series imo</p>

            <p>I heard PCF were working on this now, and that BS2 was cancelled.</p>
<p>Such a shame, but maybe PCF will make GOW much more awesome!</p>

            <p>It will be. It’s the story about how Baird went from top dog in his squad to the guy that always gets told to shut up in Marcus’s.</p>
<p>Probably a sad story.</p>
