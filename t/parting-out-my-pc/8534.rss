    <title>Parting out my PC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/parting-out-my-pc/8534</link>
    <description>So at the end of this month my computer (Actually just the Hard Drives) is going into storage for a very long time. I decided I would try to part out what I can and I am giving the Black Mesa Community first dibs before I post on Craigslist because I like you guys soooo much.

    I have 2 8800 GT eVGA video cards with 512 Megs of GDDR3 RAM.

    A Cosmos Cooler Master computer chassis 

    A  MSI Platinum K9N Motherboard with the AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 6400+ 2.00 GHz 

    I have a Creative SB X-Fi Sound Card.

    An Enermax PSU with (I believe, will double check later) 600W max specs. (The Enermax PSU is a great PSU. I&#39;ve had it since 2005 when I built my first computer with it. No signs of failing what-so-ever. I would never buy anything other than Enermax.) 

    There are more parts but I can&#39;t think of them off the top of my head right now. I will add pictures, prices, and more detailed specs tonight or tomorrow but no later than tomorrow. Feel free to make offers via PM... First come first serve...

   Also, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m allowed to sell on these forums. I figured I&#39;d apply myself to the rule that &quot;It is better to ask for forgiveness than it is for permission.&quot; 

****Note****
  All parts but the Enermax PSU I bought in December 2007. I have NOT overclocked ANY parts for the purpose of a long lasting life because I am not rich and couldn&#39;t afford the parts breaking down for the sake of better performance.</description>
