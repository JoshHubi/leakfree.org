    <title>[SUGGESTIONS] Gameplay tweaks and so on...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestions-gameplay-tweaks-and-so-on/13956</link>
    <description>I have a few suggestions and hopefully you guys can tell me what you think in the replies section or make your own suggestion. It would be nice if we can combine all future suggestions in one post like this.

1. Make the crowbar a little slower, it seems way too over powered with its attack rate.

2. Add AUX Power like in Half Life 2, it seems unfair that you can sprint forever and some areas are made a lot easier because of it.
*Underwater Breading should drain AUX power
*Sprinting should drain AUX power
*Flashlight should drain AUX power

3. Nerf the hivehand, it is way too overpowered in multiplayer, my suggestion is to make it harder to track people with the hornets the gun fires.</description>

            <p>Maybe the flashlight only should drain the AUX power? Who the hell even uses the flashlight? (unless there are dark areas in Xen) So yeah I disagree too that it should drain power.</p>

<p>That is a known bug apparently, and is going to be fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, just no. The original half-life did not have this crap, so Black Mesa will not have it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing to say about it.</p>
