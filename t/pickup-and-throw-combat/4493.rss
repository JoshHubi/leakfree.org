    <title>Pickup and Throw Combat?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pickup-and-throw-combat/4493</link>
    <description>I think it would be interesting to see how you could include the pickup and throw into a combat situation. Imagine it, a Headcrab is coming towards you but you pick up a rock or other piece of debris and throw it at it! It would of course not be as powerful as a weapon and the strength of the throw wouldn&#39;t be as good as the Gravity Gun but it would enable combat situations similar to using the Gravity Gun. Plus it would be pretty realistic. (If I were to pick up a large rock and throw it a soldier, I&#39;m pretty sure it will hurt him regardless of any armor that he has that&#39;s made to stop bullets) It would be an interesting way to use the new physics engine.</description>

<p>Besides, you need the long jump module for further distance, so increased strength its not inherent in the suit.</p>

            <p>I guess the HEV suit does give you the strength to pick up enemies like it was nothing. It’d be cool to be able to corner an enemy against a railing, and just pick them up and throw them off XD.</p>

<p>But damage from a large cardboard box would be less. My point is that the source engine already calculates physics damage &amp; does so more accurately than we’re describing.</p>

            <p>seems a bit odd to reset the timer<br>
you probably did it because it would be almost impossible to pick up a grenade without it blowing up in your face, but I think that would probably add to the rush</p>

            <p>Fuse time is 2.5 seconds.<br>
Picking up the grenade with the +use key will reset the timer to 2.5 seconds under two conditions.</p>
<ol>
<li>it was the first time the grenade was picked up</li>
<li>the timer was less than 2.5 seconds</li>
</ol>

            <p>So I was right and wrong. Correct time, wrong person.<br>
But wiki doesn’t really help me here. That quote is from way back. Almost 2 years ago. Hence why I’m <span class="bbcode-i">hoping</span> (I can’t really know for sure) it still is that way.</p>
<p>Or are you telling me, that everything in the wiki is up to date and correct?</p>
