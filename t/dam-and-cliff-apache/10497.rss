    <title>Dam and Cliff Apache?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dam-and-cliff-apache/10497</link>
    <description>Are they supposed to be the same helicopter, or completely different ones in the mod?

 I could&#39;ve sworn they were all supposed to be the same helicopter in the original game, hence the RPG signifying you could finally beat that damn thing that&#39;s been tormenting you all that time.

 I did initially think the same for black mesa (I purposely avoided killing it on the Dam with the Tau for this reason), but since you give so much Tau ammo on the Dam and you [i]can[/i] kill it and you [i]can[/i] do the same in HL1 - I&#39;m not so sure, I thought it was just an oversight that you could kill the Apache with the Tau in the original. 

Or is it supposed to be a situation where both apply (I noticed the heli actually flies away if you leave it be in BM) where if you don&#39;t kill it, the boss fight &quot;is&quot; the same one, and if you do kill it, the boss fight is supposedly a new one?</description>

<p>In the original, I always destroyed the one at the dam with the tau cannon the moment it showed up.  It takes two charged shots on hard.  Ditto the one that comes at you after you’ve gone through the bottom of the dam and climbed up into the area where the storm drain leading to the cliff is.</p>

</aside>
<p>You realise that a crapload of gunships weaken the antagonizing and make cliffside boss battle less significant?</p>

            <p>I shot it with an infinite ammo gluon gun and it just kept hovering in place while i shot it. It flies off if you stop shooting it, so i’m guessing you can only kill it if it happens to be in that position.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure it just flies off. I drained 3-4 charged tau shots onto it and still didn’t trigger an explosion.</p>

            <p>If you “kill” the dam Apache, it bursts into flames and flies off, like in Water Hazard in HL2.</p>
