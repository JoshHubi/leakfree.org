    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shepards-role-in-the-next-installments/8707</link>
    <description>Personally, I think Shepard should return in half-life 3 or episode 3 ( whatever you want to call it)

I don&#39;t think I could conjure up a viable reason for Shepard joining Gordon  but I think that it would be good to flesh out Shepard&#39;s personality and story. I genuinely think  Valve could create a good character out of him.




but that is  just my opinion. how do you think Shepard should fit in? do you think he should be part of  Gordon&#39;s story at all?  Discuss</description>

            <p>I can see Shepherd being brought back, although not out of any particular love for the character, and not as a protagonist.</p>
<p>Gordon’s been freed from the G-Man’s influence by the Vortigaunts, so it looks like the G-Man has lost his primary agent on this world. I don’t see him as having the power to directly alter things, he can merely influence others, sometimes subtlety, sometimes in a more manual, mind-control-like way as he did with Alyx. It makes sense that he’d now be using his other assets to strengthen his position, which will probably bring him into conflict with Gordon and the Vorts.</p>
<p>I can see him using Shephard as a human agent whose function is to appear at the worst possible times and mess up Gordon’s plans as much as possible, and who Gordon has to kill at some point. It’d be a nice call back to Half Life having to fight a HECU soldier, and offer an interesting parallel considering Gordon was also once one of the G-Man’s agents, although I admit it might seem a bit random to people who haven’t played Opposing Force. This is the only way I can see Shepherd returning, since he’s currently under G-Man’s control, and as it doesn’t look like the G-Man will be having much of a positive role beyond this point, I don’t see how Shepherd could emerge a protagonist from that.</p>

            <p>Sorry, there’s so many Shephard and Shepherd spellings that I get confused. But yeah, I think its with an ‘a’. And I also think that the reason lots of Half-Life fans are so interested in his return is because he’s the only one from the Black Mesa Incident who we haven’t had any word on. (Except Cross and Greene, but I don’t see too many people caring about them much). But I think that if they reinclude him in the Half-Life Universe, it should be his own game. Otherwise, it would take away from the personality that the player gives him. I think that’s part of what makes him so popular. I know that I approach all the games in the anthology differently, depending on the character. Maybe I’m just weird. (duh)</p>

            <p>Personally, I preferred the level design in opposing force. I also enjoyed fighting Xen aliens, Black Ops and Race X alongside other marines. However, the protagonist had little to do with anything, just being a couple of hands in front of the screen for the most part.</p>
<p>If I were to choose one of the protagonists though, I would still choose Freeman. Adrian was a generic gas masked grunt. Freeman slaughtered countless Adrian Shepherds.</p>
<p>How many Gordon Freemans did Shepherd kill? Eh?</p>

            <p>I’m thinking production for a game with Shepard. When Half-Life 2 was in production, Valve tried their absolute hardest to keep the poject a secret. Except for a few leaks, I’d say it was  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Anyways, what I’m saying is that they may be doing the same thing here. Shepard reached popularity they didn’t expect and now they could be working on a project that’d be centered around him or include him. Not saying it could be Half-Life 3 or Episode 3, but you never know.</p>

<p>I understand your point.  It does work better for Valve with the expansions being non-canon.  I’m not arguing with you on that.</p>
<p>They did pull two significant points out of them to use as canon, though.  Making the point that the name Barney has been around before Half-Life has nothing to do with anything in this thread.</p>

<p>Subject: B. Calhoun.</p>
<p>For HL2, they decided that, at the very least, the Barney banging on the door at the beginning of Inbound is indeed <span class="bbcode-i">the</span> Barney, and that his last name is Calhoun.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You completely miss the point I was making.</p>
<p>The idea of a guard man named Barney existed to some degree already in the original Half-Life game and probably goes back even further in time to the very first drafts for characters and story arcs. But that’s not what’s of interest.</p>
<p>From a designer’s point of view the addons with regards to content are so loosely connected to Half-Life 2 that it seems like the developers at Valve don’t care much at all of what happened in the extensions of Half-Life 1. Now I understand that there was never a complete master plan for the Half-Life universe. Only a few concretes ideas for characters, locations and key elements existed. The rest of the universe remained in a draft state. Vague ideas existed but none of these were formulated and concretised as long as you are not even close to encounting them at your current stage of development. In design it’s sometimes better just to know the direction your heading to and make decisions about which path you’re going take just before you are about to encounter them. This way maximum freedom and creativity is given to the developers, spontaneous ideas can be included into the product and much more important fundamental design flaws (sc. big bangs) are less likely to appear (which actually pose a key problem in ‘master plans’). In this sense also the addons were developed. The Gearbox developers were given some info on key story (eg. Shepard is soldier, Black Mesa is about to get nuked, Shepard gets detained) elements to be included and the rest was pretty much up for themselves to be created. And that’s exactly the sad part. The story arcs and characters which were actually done by Gearbox self have no further influence or representation in Half-Life 2 or any of the episodes.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t mind a Half Life 2: Opposing Force. Shepard added more to the Half Life Universe then a bunch of jumping puzzles. Now, I know Gordon is totally awesome and would beat Shepard in a fight, but that doesn’t mean Shepard can’t have the title of vice butt-kicker. They don’t have to tie it in completely, because that would be hard, but I think that it could make for an interesting plot twist.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why do people equate Gearbox’s good level design in Opposing Forces with Shepard being a character worth revisiting?</p>
<p>Shepard didn’t add anything, he was just another silent and even  faceless character, which gives him even less of a personality than  Gordon.</p>
