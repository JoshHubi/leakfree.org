    <title>My brother&#39;s new 360 Slim is freezing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-brothers-new-360-slim-is-freezing/6082</link>
    <description>My brother got a new 360 slim for Christmas today.  I transferred over his stuff via USB and he played the shit out of it for a good hour or so.  Then my cousins came over and we continued to play the shot out of it.  After a few hours, though, it started to freeze.  Now it won&#39;t play for more than twenty minutes.

Is it possible the son of a bitch overheated on the first day?  We have it placed horizontally on a glass shelf, with plenty of space above and next to it.  I did place my hand on it and felt it was borderline hot, but I guess that means the fan is working and blowing the hot air out. 

Any ideas?  Laser error?  Just a faulty model?  Will another model actually work?</description>

<p>i’d say it’s a pretty smart business strategy to make them break so often if the kids are gonna keep buying brand new ones</p>
<p>the fault lies within the stupidity of the customers, not the company</p>
<p>i’d never re-buy a console, like ever. but hey i’ve never had a newer console since my old saturn (which still works perfectly)</p>

            <p>Yes I know that the Ps3 is less likely to break, but still its the only console that have broken for me, my NES, PS1, gamecube, wii and 360 (2nd hand) are working like a charm. And i probably had less than 20h of total playtime on the ps3.</p>
<p>But I guess I just had some bad luck.</p>

            <p>Well no, he <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> right. The average Wii gamer is a casual gamer who doesn’t play for extended amounts of time like the average gamer for the PS3 and 360 are. But Microsoft is always in such a rush to put out products that they never actually make sure it’s built well. The original 360 had major reliability issues, as well as this new one. PS3s have failures, but as has been stated, it’s not really a huge thing because like Daedalus stated, electronic hardware WILL fail after a lot of use, but the PS3 is actually built fairly well. The only reason a lot of people use the 360 over the PS3 is its game library, and now the PS3 actually has a pretty awesome library, so now it’s mostly brand loyalty, and they don’t want to shell out $300 for another console. It’s kind of ridiculous, considering the amount of bullshit most 360 owners go through.</p>
<p>I’ve seriously had my friends tell me about the number of 360s they go through, AND THEY STILL USE THEM. It’s fucking retarded that you would go through so much for a console that IS going to fail because the company that manufactures them is too fucking stupid to actually make sure that their product is built to last.</p>

<p>Yeah, every electronic device can fail. The difference is that the chance that a PS3 will fail is within the normal failure rate of electronic devices. The 360…not so much.</p>
<p>I have a PS1 from 1995, a PS2 (Silver slim), a PSP and a PS3 and non of them have ever failed for me. All of them are still working perfectly.</p>

            <p>Yeah my friend still has the 1st gen xbox (they waited in line at best buy) which is used almost every day since, always with new games (he gave it to his younger brother) and it never fucked up once, actually the DVD player committed suicide and had to be replaced, that’s how old it is.</p>

            <p>from the sound of all your faggots 360s they’re all made of dicks. Mine has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It has overheated once. But that was because it was a hot day and there was poor airflow.</p>

            <p>Got a new one.</p>
<p>This one momentarily switched to a checkerboard pattern which went away upon restart.</p>
<p>Maybe the way the 360 is placed on my shelf <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> problematic?</p>

            <p>That is why I don’t own a 360 anymore, they are just the crysler sebring of gaming. Unreliable would be an understatement. If you want a “good” console, get a PS3, but if you really like the 360 controller better, buy this magical device called the cross battle adapter by XCM &amp; it works. The sweet feeling of a 360 controller on a PS3 playing Uncharted &amp; Ico is amazing, may include grief &amp; feeling a bit sly, but its epic nonetheless.</p>
<p>Or you could just get a gaming rig like the others mentioned, I just prefer the game pad over the mouse &amp; keyboard for some reason.</p>
