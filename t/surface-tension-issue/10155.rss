    <title>Surface Tension Issue?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/surface-tension-issue/10155</link>
    <description>I should still be in Surface Tension, so here&#39;s the problem I found:

The section with the dropship and the alien grunts, I stayed in the tunnel and kept killing soldiers as they ran down into the tunnel.  Eventually, as I made mistakes and died, my save files stopped loading and I had to force quit Black Mesa in order to exit the frozen loading screen.  I think that, because the dropship seems to generate an infinite number of soldiers, the amount of bodies eventually corrupted the save files.

My fix:  I simply rushed out, shot the dropship down with rockets and proceeded as normal.</description>
