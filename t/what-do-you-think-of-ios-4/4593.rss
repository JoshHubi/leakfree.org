    <title>What do you think of iOS 4?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-do-you-think-of-ios-4/4593</link>
    <description>Okay, discussion thread for you that have installed iOS 4 on you iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad. The update was released yesterday.

How well did you think Apple implemented the new functions? What functions do you miss? If you have device that cant run all the functions, what do you think of it? What do you think Apple should have included for 2nd generation devices?</description>

            <p>Well, guess I was wrong with the trademark bits, but the original point still stands. Apple is licensing the names from Cisco.</p>
<p>And Apple still either uses “Mac” in front of everything, or “i”, since “MacPhone” just sounds downright retarded, the other option was “iPhone”. iPhone happened to be owned by another company, so they decided to license the name. Then they needed a name for the iPhone OS (instead of “iPhone OS”, obviously), and since “MacOS” already exists, they went for “iOS”, that happens to be owned by the same company, so they license that name as well.</p>

<p>Get real! LMAO! Cisco have used IOS “Internetwork Operating System” since the early 90’s before “i” anything especially the iPod! I started working with Cisco at ver 10 of IOS in 95!</p>
<p>And they got “iPhone” when they acquired Selsius Systems for their VoIP solution in 2002!</p>
<p>And I’ve heard… “dont quote me” that a ladies sanitary “Panty Liner” company is claiming ipad too…</p>

<p>Well at least they asked this time… they usually take first and ask later - or argue the toss it was theirs all along… kinda lacking the imagination that everyone seems to think apple has a heap off thou! how can it be Cisco skanking apple? If you want to use something that belongs to someone else you have to pay for it… simple.</p>

<p>Also, it was Cisco that trademarked the name “iPhone” and “iOS”, the moment it became clear that Apple likes to put an “i” in front of their products. They never did anything with the trademark, their sole purpose was to force Apple into a corner, and they succeeded. The silly part is that they automatically lose their trademark if they don’t do anything with it themselves for a certain amount of time. Unless that law only applies to Europe :&lt;</p>
<p>This is the exact same as URL-hoarding. Companies just register certain URLs that have a high chance of being used at some point, so they can sell it for a lot more money than they originally purchased it for (belgium.be is/was owned by a Dutchman, for example).</p>

            <p>Having only an iPhone 3G (no S), I don’t benefit from all of the new features so I guess my favourite so far has been the introduction of folders to store apps in. I had something like 5 screens of apps which are now in one page of folders. I think the other improvements will grow on me. Not sure about the 5x digital zoom though, it’s not exactly good.</p>

<p>There already is. Redsn0w .95 beta. Im running it on my 8gig iTouch 2g. For some reason apple disabled home screen wallpapers and multitasking for the iTouch 2g when it can clearly run it (Jailbreaking iOS 4 enables those two features for the iTouch 2g).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The reasoning I saw on another website actually made sense; Apple is all into providing a completely perfect end-user experience. Having a bunch of features that don’t run as well or not at all destroys that experience. From what I’ve heard, it <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> multitask, just not as well, so for those people its better to not have the feature than having a deal breaking mixed in with the other cool stuff they introduced.</p>

            <p>They didn’t allow custom wallpapers for anything older than the iPhone 3G because the animation of the icons on a custom background wasn’t smooth enough.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>

<p>Anyway, iOS4 works like charm, loving the neat little features they added, but it really isn’t all that different than the previous OS… Then again, I haven’t had the chance to test multitasking, but I’m not even sure if the latest gen iPod Touch supports that.</p>

            <p>Doesnt the redsn0w beta only run on Mac? Also, is it untethered?</p>
<p>It is stupid that apple removed custom home screen wallpapers! I mean, why? It doesnt use any resources on the device!</p>

            <p>There already is. Redsn0w .95 beta. Im running it on my 8gig iTouch 2g. For some reason apple disabled home screen wallpapers and multitasking for the iTouch 2g when it can clearly run it (Jailbreaking iOS 4 enables those two features for the iTouch 2g).</p>

            <p>Okay, discussion thread for you that have installed iOS 4 on you iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad. The update was released yesterday.</p>
<p>How well did you think Apple implemented the new functions? What functions do you miss? If you have device that cant run all the functions, what do you think of it? What do you think Apple should have included for 2nd generation devices?</p>
