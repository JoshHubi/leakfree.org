    <title>popcap games keep crashing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/popcap-games-keep-crashing/3367</link>
    <description>Every time I try to start a popcap game a windows message pops up telling that me popcapgame1.exe won&#39;t work anymore. It&#39;s all the same with Peggle Deluxe, Peggle Extreme and the Plants vs. Zombies Demo.  :frowning: 

I tried to run Peggle in XP compatibility mode, as admin, with visual styles etc deactivated and in 640x480 resolution and several combinations of those options but it was always the same windows error... of course I also tried reinstalling it, Peggle Extreme and Plants vs. Zombies were downloaded after I noticed that Peggle didn&#39;t work anymore.

btw, i run Windows 7 x64. Can&#39;t remember if I had it already running on this pc but I think so.

Did Anyone have any similar problems or any more ideas what to do?

Edit: I also tried validating the game cache and defragmentating the game files, wasn&#39;t of any help either</description>

            <p>I just found the solution to my problem and thought I’d post it just in case someone having the same problem stumbles upon this thread.</p>
<p>The correct translation of the error message would actually be “popcapgame1.exe has stopped working”. After a quick search for this phrase on google I found a link to the <a href="https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=856471" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Steam Forums</a>. The solution was to deactivate the ingame overlay in the game’s settings</p>

            <p>I tried that with Peggle Deluxe. I deleted all the game files via steam and then downloaded the game again but it was still the same error message :\</p>
<p>btw, I just bought Batman Arkham Asylum and I also get an error message when trying to launch it but that might also be some other kind of problem…</p>
