    <title>Terminator – What would you do with the franchise?</title>

    <description>Terminator – What would you do with the franchise?

Since Cameron jumped off the ship and MGM (Was it?) decided to rape the franchise for all the money it was worth, Terminator hasn’t been doing too well but if you was to get the rights to make a terminator film what would you do with it?

Here are some of Joss Whedon’s suggestions to inspire you…
1)	Terminator... of the Rings! Yeah, what if he time-travelled TOO far... back to when there was dragons and wizards? (I think it was the Dark Ages.) Hasta La Vista, Boramir! Cool, huh? &quot;Now you gonna be Gandalf the Red!&quot; RRRRIP! But then he totally helps, because he&#39;s a cyborg and he doesn&#39;t give a s#&amp;% about the ring -- it has no power over him! And he can carry it AND Frodo AND Sam AND f@%&amp; up some orcs while he&#39;s doing it. This stuff just comes to me. I mean it. (I will also offer $10,000 for the Lord of the Rings franchise).
2) More Glau. Hey. There&#39;s a reason they&#39;re called &quot;Summer&quot; movies.
3) Can you say... musical? Well don&#39;t. Even I know that&#39;s an awful idea.
4) Christian Bale&#39;s John Connor will get a throat lozenge. This will also help his Batwork (ten grand for that franchise too, btw.)
5) More porn. John Connor never told Kyle Reese this, but his main objective in going to the past was to get some. What if there are a lot of future-babies that have to be made? Cue wah-wah pedal guitar -- and dollar signs!
6) The movies will stop getting less cool

How about a terminator that travels back to the black mesa incident to kill G-Man... Not a great (Or even good) suggestion but you get the idea</description>

            <p>one word… remake, lets make it darker YEAH and have a new twist on the orgin story OMG money! Oh wait thats a terrible idea, didn’t you hear me I said money! MONEY!</p>
<p>How about a Terminator film where all the mo fo’s who were responsible for Terminator 3 are hunted down and terminated</p>
<p>Or do what Jason did… Terminator In Space!</p>
<p>Or what about a film where someone reprograms a Terminator to go back to World War 2 and kill Hitler (Not when he’s a kid or his mom, the Hitler at the height of his power), one terminator, thousands of nazis, one hitler ='s Cinematic Gold</p>
<p>Or and this is my last suggestion Terminator in the middle east hunting Bin Laden</p>

            <p>It was good that Sarah Connor chronicles ended. It had a lot of awful episodes during its second season. On commercial television it is hard to do a show with integrity. There is always the need get as much out of a thin script as possible so they can earn a lot of money on it.<br>
You see this with a bunch of shows on television. Except shows on cable networks like Showtime and HBO. Their shows are of a much higher quality because they don’t got ads. People actually pay for their TV there.</p>
<p>Then again I don’t believe you can get much more out of the Terminator franchise. I rather see new IP than some rehash of Terminator.</p>

            <p>I would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Smack MCG upside his frikkin’ head, T: S was a terrible film and I’m ashamed to share a birthday with that crappy movie’s release date</li>
<li>Re-make the first one making perfectly sure that Batman Doesn’t play the role of John Connor and That the guy playing the role of Kyle Reese isn’t Jumping between sets (anyone else notice Kyle’s freshly-cleaned hair in that evening scene?)</li>
<li>Make Damn sure any Terminator movies taking place after “Judgment day” don’t have Skynet going after <em>gasps</em> spoiler alert, Kyle (WHY MCG, WHY DID YOU MAKE SUCH A GODAWFUL plothole?)</li>

<p>They pretty much have to, what else are they going to do? But it’s all Arnold-based lines, there’s only so much you can do with “I’ll be back” before it gets repetitive. On the other hand, lines like “For FUCK’s sake, man, you’re amateur!” and “you and me, we’re fuckin’ DONE professionally!” have tons of applications for various scenes that could come up.</p>

<p>They pretty much have to, what else are they going to do? But it’s all Arnold-based lines, there’s only so much you can do with “I’ll be back” before it gets repetitive. On the other hand, lines like “For FUCK’s sake, man, you’re amateur!” and “you and me, we’re fuckin’ DONE professionally!” have tons of applications for various scenes that could come up.</p>

            <p>T3 and T4 suffered from the lack of the memorable catchphrases that made T2 so great. Fortunately for the franchise, Christian Bale’s on-set rage provided them with a plethora of made-to-order catchphrases for the next film. I will be sorely dissapointed if this isn’t referenced.</p>

            <p>Apparently the co-writer of the second movie has a great script. I am not sure, but if he was in anyway involved with the second movie, he should be taken seriously. Very seriously.</p>
