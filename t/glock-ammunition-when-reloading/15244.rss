    <title>Glock Ammunition when reloading</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glock-ammunition-when-reloading/15244</link>
    <description>Hello, I don&#39;t know if it has already been adressed, but I just realised that the ammo when reloading with a non-empty mag is wrong. On the real Glock 17 you&#39;re able to fire 18 bullets when you put a new mag while there&#39;s a round in the chamber, and in the &quot;non-empty&quot; reloading animation, that extra bullet is not removed, so you should have 18 rounds, but instead, a bullet vanishes and you have 17 rounds again. (sorry for the broken english, i&#39;m not familiar with firearms terms)</description>

<p>I’d be a neat detail if it worked like that, but it might also confuse non-gun people if the weapon sometimes has 17 rounds and sometimes 18</p>

</aside>
<p>I know guns only from games and movies and something like that would really confuse or annoy me. Sometimes I’m even so tired of reloading the weapons that I occasianally wish there was no reloading at all, like in Doom or Quake. But that would feel wrong in Black Mesa or other Half-Life games.</p>

            <p>It’s a really minor thing and not really worth implementing when HL1 and 2 don’t do it either. I’d be a neat detail if it worked like that, but it might also confuse non-gun people if the weapon sometimes has 17 rounds and sometimes 18.</p>
<p>Fun fact though - while in development, HL1 originally had Glock reloads work like that, close enough to release that the Day One demo still has the functionality in playable form.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I know it’s nitpicking, but now that I’ve noticed it, it really bothers me <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Whilst it would be cool if the developers implemented wet and dry reloading (the animations are already there), it is not a feature that is of high priority.<br>
Barely any games do this sort of reloading, so I’m guessing the developers will ignore this and work on more important things, like finishing Xen and improving multiplayer movement.</p>
