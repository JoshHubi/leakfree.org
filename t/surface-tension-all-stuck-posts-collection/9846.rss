    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/surface-tension-all-stuck-posts-collection/9846</link>
    <description>Hello, I want to say first that you&#39;ve done a very great job in about every aspect (except maybe marines damage/reactivity) on this remake.

I&#39;m stuck here :

[url]https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/1135162003816012730/4187781840F262EA975033C80D6C7E7EAC5CA127/[/url]

I know I have to do an airstrike in the original HL, but I don&#39;t know how to do it here, or maybe I have to do something else in Black Mesa? I&#39;ve tried Use , Fire 1, Fire 2, no key work to launch the airstrike anywhere on the minimap. Somebody has already gone through it?

Thank you.</description>

            <p>technically, you CAN get past the soldiers without killing the helicopter. I did.<br>
You would not have much health left though.<br>
But there are health packs before you kill vortigaunts, so it is doable. Not easy but doable</p>

            <p>It’s obvious that he ran across the bridge not knowing it would break, of course he didn’t jump in the water.</p>
<p>As for aimbot, the helicopter has two seats, which most likely means it has two people, one for flying, and another for aiming and shooting. And I’m pretty sure it has a target selecting system.</p>
<p>Watch from this point to 3:27 and you’ll see what I mean.<br>

            <p>I’m sorry, but I didn’t have any trouble at all with the helicopter fight. I just pelted it with rockets while sprinting back and forth, and went back into the storage room whenever I needed more rockets or to top of my health and suit power, and it went down really quickly. I never even needed the supply crate.</p>

            <p>I found this segment FAR easier to pass once I turned on ‘Always Run’.  I dunno if it was just my technique, but sprint/crouch jumping was not nearly as effective.</p>

            <p>Reason the whole place goes kaboom is that its filled with way to much explosives, including what look like ICBMs, which black mesa decommissions as a side project (or cover).  I havent gotten there in Black Mesa yet but I remember that place well from HL1.</p>

<p>The way I did it was to trigger the arrival of the helicopter, then rush back to the little warehouse. Thanks to the spare ammunition in there for the experimental laser gun thing, I just shot it with that until it flew away.</p>

            <p>It seems I can’t advance anywhere, after the chopper is dead. The door (in the room where I found the rocket launcher) is not opening, no-clipping through it doesn’t seem to accomplish anything, so unless that’s NOT the way I’m supposed to be going, the game bugged.</p>
<p>Any advice? I tried searching on this topic, with no results sooooo I’m creating a thread.</p>

            <p>I found that if you just jump straight into the water, chances are you’ll be killed or have little to no health left by the time you get rid of it.</p>
<p>The way I did it was to trigger the arrival of the helicopter, then rush back to the little warehouse. Thanks to the spare ammunition in there for the experimental laser gun thing, I just shot it with that until it flew away.</p>
<p>Simple, and especially useful for the fact that there are 2 health packs, and 2 charge stations in that particular warehouse.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply…</p>
<p>I’m up to here:</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>The stairs are just along the corridor to the right. Is that laser supposed to be jumpable?</p>

<p>In Surface Tension… you know the one  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>A mini walkthrough of this little area would be hugely appreciated. As much as I hate asking for help, I can’t figure out the way through for the life of me and after about an hour of constant dying I am at my wits’ end!</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

            <p>My apache fight bugged out or something. I shot at it with about 7-8 rockets, then it flew away just to come back with its left side against me while shooting towards the cliff path you come from. I had to shoot it with 3 additional full tau-charges to have it crash into the cliff.</p>
