    <title>TF2 Tips and Tricks</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tf2-tips-and-tricks/4672</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a huge TF2 nut and I&#39;ve played almost 500 lifetime hours, but sometimes, I still feel like I&#39;m getting really outplayed. Recently Valve has added some new tips in their loading menus, and those have helped, but I figure the community would also have some hints to share.

So ITT, post any tips, tricks, hints or insider knowledge you have learned for TF2. They can be general strategy tips for all classes, or gameplay tips that apply only to one class, weapon, map or game mode, or they could just be insights into how the game works. Anything that can help make a player a little more pro. Obviously, it would be good to make sure that they are up to date, but go ahead and post anything, even if it seems obvious or trivial.
Here&#39;s a few to get started.

-Crit rates are 2% for normal weapons, and 15% for melee weapons. An additional bonus of up to 10% is awarded for damage dealt in the past 20 seconds, scaling linearly up from 0 damage to 800 damage. This is why when you&#39;re doing really well you tend to get a lot of crits, and also is why the wrench crits so much.

-As a Sniper, you have a very narrow field of view when scoped in with your rifle. If you are alone with no one to watch your back, avoid staying zoomed for too long so you won&#39;t get snuck up on by enemies. You can also learn to use the Huntsman so you don&#39;t have this problem. Also, do not count on the Razorback to protect you from spies. Good ones will just shoot you instead, so be prepared to spycheck at all times.

-Always err on the side of caution. Lag compensation can cause some major headaches if you try to cut it down to the wire, so
(1) Duck out from heavy/sentry duels well before you&#39;re in the red. You will die faster than you think. (2) If you are a medic with an uber, and you or your target start to take damage, activate the charge quickly and don&#39;t wait til the last second. It is better to spring it early then to die and not have it at all. (3) If you think a demo is going to charge, get out of the way. If you don&#39;t, he&#39;ll have chopped your head off by the time you start to move.

-Keep one of every weapon, and learn to use them. Their drawbacks and strengths make them suited for different situations. For example, use the Direct Hit to quickly take out sentries; use the Rocket Launcher to clear control points.</description>

            <p>The one big disadvantage to the KGB, contrary to what the previous guy said, is there’s no kill-taunt. Considering Heavy’s quick-draw is longer-range and silent, it’s one of the better ones.</p>
<p>As Heavy, wait as long as you can before spinning up. The goal being that once you’re in full spin, the enemy has no cover available to him. Most of the time if someone see another guy at the end of a corridor, they spin up and shoot him a bit, then jump out and attack more. Don’t bother with the first part; go to the end of the corridor so he can’t duck behind anything. Your goal is not to deal damage to people - it is to KILL them. Also, you are very good against pyros when using Natascha. (keep this in mind if your team is getting burned)</p>
<p>During an attack map where you’re blocked by a sentry camp or something, if your team will listen to anyone, convince them to go all at once. When people start to die every 15 seconds, the spawning becomes staggered. Instead just be one flailing mass. (It’s pretty funny to take 15 scouts with bats, send them at a level 3 sentry, and watch it get torn to shreds)</p>

<p>Unless ambushing at close quarters, M1+W is a good way to die as a pyro.  No way you will get across large, open spaces.  I love surprising groups of noobs, causing them to fallback and retreat in chaos.  It is satisfying to hold off a large advance until your teammates can support the lines.</p>
<p>BTW, freezer burn is the name of one of the pyros achievements.</p>

<p>Well, search LaPippin on YouTube. he stayed alive for what I remember 30 minutes. Not that you must be, but good spies do what you do: Backstab sap staying alive and using the revolver/Amby</p>

            <p>I play TF2 on a regular basis, I’m not the best player ever but I do a good enough job. My main class is heavy and most of my tips will be heavy related.</p>
<p>-Sandvich is invaluable: If there are no medics it will save your ass. Also if you can’t take the time to eat it, toss it to gain health or heal a injured medic.<br>
-KGB: Besides the fun taughnt kill the default melee has, there are no draw backs to using this. Also very good for checking dead ringer spies i.e. punch spy=dead but no crits= dinger spy that must die.<br>
-Snipers,spies and other heavies are your main threat as heavy .<br>
-Spies are fairly obvious just check your back every so often especially if you hear the screaming of a backstab.<br>
-Snipers with rifles are the most dangerous take alternative routes to sneak up on them and don’t go linear. Huntsman usually have bad aim just run up to them, don’t go linear and shoot.<br>
-When there is another heavy try closing the distance between him and you with cover because a long drawn out minigun fight from across the map will chew your ammo up and make you a sniper/spy bait.<br>
-Basic rule of heavy on heavy fights: First to shoot wins unless he has a medic.<br>
-In general jump often, it makes you harder to snipe, rev your gun around corners if you suspect an enemy, check your back, prioritize your medic(Bring him to health and don’t always go on suicide missions.), natasha is a whore and have fun.<br>
-For other classes don’t be afraid to take one for the team i.e. going engy or medic, if your decent your team will be  happy.<br>
-Snipers are not good in excess but if you go sniper try to be more team oriented, like counter sniping and jarate assists.<br>
-Spies should take snipers, engies and medics as there priorities.<br>
-If your a pyro don’t be an M1+W whore, use the shotty, compression blast and axtingushier.</p>

<p>Anyone can backstab. Backstab =/= playing right necessarily. Playing right = staying alive and getting valuable targets, however. Stairstabs are just a mere trick you can do if you have mastered the class.</p>
