    <description>So, Tentacles.  Right now, the Tentacle seems to be hardwired around the Blast Pit chamber and will slam its head into three different tiers of platforms, even if they don&#39;t exist.  It would be nice if we could, at a minimum, lock it to the &quot;floor&quot; level so it doesn&#39;t raise itself up and down.  This seems like something that would be necessary for Xen in any case.</description>
