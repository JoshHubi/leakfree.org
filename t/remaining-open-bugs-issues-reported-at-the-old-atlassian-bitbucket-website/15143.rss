    <title>Remaining &quot;Open&quot; Bugs/Issues Reported At The Old Atlassian Bitbucket Website</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/remaining-open-bugs-issues-reported-at-the-old-atlassian-bitbucket-website/15143</link>
    <description>Are you BMS Devs still monitoring and acting upon the newly reported game issues still being posted on the old Atlassian Bitbucket website? No BMS Dev or Rep has responded or posted a comment for quite some time concerning the many newly discovered game issues.

Has the time come to shutdown the Atlassian Bitbucket website, considering that it appears that it&#39;s no longer being actively supported?</description>
