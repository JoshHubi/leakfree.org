    <description>Long title ftw.

Anyway, I&#39;m sure you all know that Apple is trying to get rid of Flash for most, if not all of the dynamic content on the web today. They&#39;re pushing HTML5 and H.264 decoding to the frontline because Flash has too many issues (related to reliability, security and performance).

Ever since Apple announced the iPad and the obvious refusal of Flash, Adobe has been taking shots at Apple, claiming that Apple is making a mistake and that they won&#39;t succeed in pushing HTML5 to replace 90% of the current dynamic web content.

Today, Microsoft has announced that they too will be pushing HTML5 and H.264 decoding in Internet Explorer (and thus in everything they ship outside of Windows). And while they aren&#39;t as aggressive in its attacks on Adobe as Apple, they still back the same reasons Apple has given in order to get rid of Flash: security, performance and reliability. And while MS still claims that Flash will remain an important part of the web, I feel that there&#39;s no future left. Flash videos (like the kind you find on newgrounds.com) will swap over to H.264, and Flash sites haven&#39;t been around since 2006. 

I think Adobe got stuck in a war it cannot win, and I&#39;m happy about that. I never liked Flash and I welcome the swap to a more reliable web experience  with open arms. I think Adobe should cave in and just drop their efforts to keep Flash on top of the dynamic web, and start looking for solutions for HTML5.

I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: Flash is dead web technology.</description>

            <p>Well, declaring Flash to be a goner would indeed be stretching a bit too far, but it’s going to take a hit for quite a large chunk of the web. Galleries, movieplayers, basic interactive applications, they’re all going to be using HTML5 and Javascript, because those two can do what Flash can not do: have proper security with proper performance.</p>
<p>Flash will remain the tool for actual animated interactivity of a wide variety, but it’ll be select and won’t be used on websites that generate a lot of traffic for news and media.</p>
<p>Also, Mango Assassin is clueless. The company I work for has close ties with Adobe and we develop software solutions together, and Adobe still -controls- their market. There isn’t a single company that comes close to offering the solutions Adobe offers. Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Indesign, Premiere/After Effects, Acrobat… They’re all here to stay, and there’s not turn of the tide heading its way in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I do expect Fireworks to be finished at some point. Compared to Photoshop it’s just a weakling child of the family. I can see it being absorbed by Photoshop at some point, just like ImageReady.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And I disagree with what you are all saying about Flash dying. HTML5 is going to be a great addition to Web Developers arsenal, but everything that can be done with HTML5 is already being done with JavaScript, yet flash still exists. Why? Because Flash uses it’s own rendering engine, and hence is capable of much more interactivity and dynamics than JavaScript or HTML5 will be capable of.</p>
<p>We also have to remember that while HTML5 is developing, Flash is also developing, if it stayed static then of course HTML5 would catch it up. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Fantastic news, but since web developers will still have to support old IE browsers that don’t support HTML5 for a long time to come it’s not going to change anything overnight. In the meantime I guess there’s always javascript for all your normal flash needs.</p>
<p>A nice step in the right direction though.</p>
<p>Adobe are only pissed off because they haven’t got their money’s worth from Flash yet anyway.</p>

            <p>only reason why microsoft is doing that is so there “version” of flash (which is Silverlight) will be more popular. My dad acctuly programs production content with java, silverlight, and flash, and he says that the best one of the three is Silverlight, becuase its easy to use and it has never once crashed on him</p>

<p>Who the hell decided that HTML5 would be a good name? Nothing with a name like that will be able to ward off Flash.</p>
<p>Oh, and I don’t think that Flash will disappear until Google stop using it, due to it being used on Youtube and therefore known to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>HTML5 is the new HTML standard.  The video codec isn’t named HTML5, in fact there isn’t a standard codec for HTML5, but h.264 seems to be gaining the most momentum.  It is in fact the codec that Youtube (Google) is switching to.  Educate yourself :retard:</p>

            <p>Flash is a huge CPU hog and is only good for short cartoons or free games, I think (and always thought) the idea of streaming videos through it on such a large scale is totally ridiculous.</p>

            <p>Who the hell decided that HTML5 would be a good name? Nothing with a name like that will be able to ward off Flash.</p>
<p>Oh, and I don’t think that Flash will disappear until Google stop using it, due to it being used on Youtube and therefore known to everyone.</p>

            <p>I do not think there is anything wrong with Flash. Big-time corporations are hyperoptimistic pussies IMO.</p>

<p>So Microsoft decided to implement HTML5 for IE? It was about time.</p>

            <p>I agree. I haven’t seen a whole lot of HTML5, but what I’ve seen is great. I had a plugin in Chrome for awhile (before youtube made HTML5 videos themselves) that changed flash to HTML5 and I noticed a huge performance and quality boost. Hopefully that becomes the norm.</p>
<p>And I didn’t realize flash sites were ever popular, rather distasteful and irritating to navigate.</p>

            <p>Long title ftw.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m sure you all know that Apple is trying to get rid of Flash for most, if not all of the dynamic content on the web today. They’re pushing HTML5 and H.264 decoding to the frontline because Flash has too many issues (related to reliability, security and performance).</p>
<p>Ever since Apple announced the iPad and the obvious refusal of Flash, Adobe has been taking shots at Apple, claiming that Apple is making a mistake and that they won’t succeed in pushing HTML5 to replace 90% of the current dynamic web content.</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft has announced that they too will be pushing HTML5 and H.264 decoding in Internet Explorer (and thus in everything they ship outside of Windows). And while they aren’t as aggressive in its attacks on Adobe as Apple, they still back the same reasons Apple has given in order to get rid of Flash: security, performance and reliability. And while MS still claims that Flash will remain an important part of the web, I feel that there’s no future left. Flash videos (like the kind you find on <a href="http://newgrounds.com" rel="nofollow noopener">newgrounds.com</a>) will swap over to H.264, and Flash sites haven’t been around since 2006.</p>
<p>I think Adobe got stuck in a war it cannot win, and I’m happy about that. I never liked Flash and I welcome the swap to a more reliable web experience  with open arms. I think Adobe should cave in and just drop their efforts to keep Flash on top of the dynamic web, and start looking for solutions for HTML5.</p>
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Flash is dead web technology.</p>
