            <p>Well that stupid part was over pretty quickly, but I agree, the humans are waaay more fun to fight, though I actually like the driving segments this time around as opposed to Crysis 2’s, and it is kinda cool to see the humans and aliens fighting each other.</p>

            <p>The alien weapons are fun to use, until you get to the crazy part and then everything becomes godmode on steroids on demand. Then it becomes kind of stupid (“I’m not DYING! Alien weapons are STRONGER! RAAAAGHHHH”). Flashy and visually cool in a theatrical sort of way, but stupid.</p>
<p>Still, If you like mindless blowing stuff up, then the later levels are fine. I still think fighting the humans is a lot more fun though.</p>

<p>That alone is enough to get me to try it out. I sure hope thats the case, because Crysis 2 let me down in too many ways.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just a warning though, it’s not <span class="bbcode-i">entirely</span> like Crysis 1. I’d say it’s a balance between Cry1 and 2. It’s much more open than Crysis 2, but it’s still linear compared to Crysis 1.</p>

            <p>Meh, Crysis has always had this problem, fighting the Aliens in every game was always dull and uninspired compared to the humans. The only one where I really enjoyed fighting them was probably Warhead because of their AI enhancements and subtle tactical changes that made them pretty different to the Koreans but not just spraying them like the first game.</p>
<p>I like the alien weapons in this game a lot though, and the stalker enemies are pretty fun to fight.</p>

            <p>The first half of the game has some really good Crysis 1 parts. There’s also one late game stage that is really good. Other than that, the game has way too many linear parts, and fighting the Ceph can start to look like someone is throwing jelly and fireworks at your screen. It makes for really sloppy combat.</p>
<p>Still, not a bad game. Just not a great one.</p>

            <p>The dialogue does get repetitive after a while:<br>
“He’s hunting us”<br>
“He’s using arrows!”</p>
<p>I like the sarcastic dialogue they’ve got at times, but some of it is so obviously scripted.</p>
<p>Claire seems to be an expy of rosenthal, the voice is somewhat similar, but there are obvious differences.</p>

            <p>Yeah I’m getting a lot of the Crysis 1 vibe. There are a ridiculous number of ways to accomplish your objectives (especially with the new hacking feature), and the options aren’t explicitly spelled out to you the way that they are in Crysis 2. It helps that objectives are non-linear a number of times, and the world is much more open than Crysis 2 was (but not quite as open as Crysis 1).</p>
<p>The gunplay is still a lot like Crysis 2 though (not a bad thing), except for the difference that the AI doesn’t suck miserably at random anymore… For instance, they no longer run into walls. Enemies are a lot more interactive now, especially in dialogue, which makes them fun to fight against (“I see a dead body! It’s one of ours!” “Who did it?” “I dunno… it looks like someone shot him… with an arrow!” “Someone’s hunting us with a bow!” “OH MY GOD DON’T LEAVE ME HERE I’M ABOUT TO DIE”). It also forces you to be careful about how and when you kill them, if you’re aiming to stealth your way through the mission.</p>
<p>Speaking of dialogue, it’s also marginally better this time around.</p>

            <p>^ I really hope so too. A big part of that was because they released the SDK many months after C2 came out. Hopefully they won’t do the same thing again.</p>
<p>I’m playing it right now, it’s actually really fun. I’m also glad they made the vehicles first person again.</p>
<p>Also the game is gorgeous. Especially in the first couple of outdoor areas, visually, I felt like I was playing in a piece of concept art.</p>

<p>Shader quality is also a pretty major option in the regard; it normally gives a huge boost, but has a really major effect on the graphics quality.</p>

<p>That’s interesting…I did some tweaking today and didn’t notice any frame drops when I set that option from low-medium to high(maybe 1-2 frames at worse).</p>

            <p>My game is getting great FPS when it works, but I had some freezing problems early on that are getting worse and worse, to the point that the game is now unplayable. I found one other dude on the internet with the same problem, but no one on the support forums has any ideas. Fucking blows.</p>

            <p>Just a tip if you don’t have a high-end GPU and want a smoother gameplay…in the Advanced Graphics setting turn the Particle option to low and you will gain around 10 FPS (depending on your system)as this seems to be the biggest resource hog and in my opinion just isn’t worth it if you don’t have the best rig out there.</p>
