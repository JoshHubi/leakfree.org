    <title>FedEx or UPS?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fedex-or-ups/5066</link>
    <description>After some credit issues with NewEgg, I&#39;ve canceled my order and I&#39;m redoing it again tonight. Question is, should I spend 200.00 on FedEx 3 day, or 200 on UPS next day?

Offense against UPS: They&#39;re means of transportation leave the packages susceptible to a six foot drop

Defense against UPS: Shit gets there quick for cheap.</description>

            <p>I’m in Korea so I only got to use FedEx, and it sucked balls. There was no damage but it came 6 days late. I should have used Korean deliveries. They are usually late, but faster than FedEx.</p>

            <p>I’ve generally found that UPS has always been on time, while the one FedEx package I once received was 2 days late.</p>
<p>Never received a damaged package of any carrier (aka: UPS, TNT and FedEx (and the Belgian Post))</p>

            <p>FedEx actually has a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?ID=D000000089&amp;Name=FedEx+Corp" data-bbcode="true">contract</a> with USPS for overnight/express deliveries.</p>
<p>Pros and cons exist with every delivery method.  It depends on what’s important to you.</p>

            <p>I have shipped a ton of stuff over the past few months (sold lots of musical gear on ebay) and had a few expensive, delicate items shipped to me. So I have done my homework on this subject.</p>
<p>Fedex uses private contractors. So they have motivation to deliver as fast as possible, because they get paid based on how many deliveries they make. The downside is that they will not hesitate to leave your package someplace stupid without anyone signing for it in order to complete the delivery and move on.</p>
<p>UPS has regular employees as drivers who are paid the same no matter how they perform. They will throw your package around or drop it off the truck, they don’t really care if its damaged. I generally avoid shipping UPS.</p>
<p>USPS is the slowest, typically the cheapest, and they are also the most reliable in terms of making sure you actually sign for the package and in terms of making sure it doesn’t get damaged.</p>
