    <description>What was the first ever game your purchased for Steam and when? Also if you want to you can include how you got it.  :stuck_out_tongue: 

Game(s) - The Orange Box
When - July 2009
How - Retail £14.99

Thought I&#39;d get to know some people a little better.  :smiley:</description>

            <p>Half-Life, early October 2007. Already played it on PS2 at my friend’s house and had the xbox version of HL2.</p>
<p>I dodged the whole “I just got orange box and what is this” bullet by a few months.</p>

            <p>My first Steam game (pack) would be the Half-Life 2 Holiday 2006 pack. Before that I used my uncle’s son’s Steam account  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
I had Half-Life retail, but I lost the damn box so I couldn’t activate it in Steam. :fffuuu:</p>

<p>Half-Life 1. Had it from retail before Steam launch, then got it registered into Steam when the whole launching with CS 1.6 and all that happened.</p>
<p>Steam used to suck major balls back then hahah. I remember all the rage because WON was getting shut down and everyone had to play on Steam now… shit kept crashing every 2 hours</p>
<p>Forgot to mention… first Steam-bought game was Half-Life 2 a few months (six or so) after release date.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is exactly how I got Steam, except even after Steam came out I still bought everything retail. My first Steam purchase was Audiosurf in 2008.</p>

<p>And you’d be right. Haven’t touched it in years, and only played it for about a month.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting concept, but the game doesn’t keep attention very long and still feels very bland and empty after very few games.</p>
