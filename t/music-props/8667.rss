It would be nice as a bonus for black mesa to feature some cheesy tunes throughout the game played back by some various situational gadgets.
It&#39;s a nice way to add a human touch to the whole thing.
Those devices could be for instance:
- Radios lying around on desks
- Elevator speakers
- PA malfunction
- A scientist playing a game on his computer
- Car radio left on
- Cellphone ringing

It&#39;s not a must and probably not worth the time, but I don&#39;t think it would take too long to implement either (provided that you guys haven&#39;t already done it).
As for the music itself, I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people here to help out, including me.

That being said,

            <p>I’m fairly sure the radios will be the only real things which function in this way. If I remember correctly, in the original they only functioned when you pressed E at them anyway.</p>

            <p>I don’t mean to sound like some forum king or anything, but this would be better for the quick suggestion/mod question thread. As for the suggestion itself, it sounds pretty cool, and I’m sure the Devs have something like this in the mod already.</p>
