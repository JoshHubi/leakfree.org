That&#39;s like, the best IRL troll ever... except it&#39;s not and I&#39;m quite interested in it.

[QUOTE= &#39;Capcom forums guy&#39;]
[b]&quot;Hi there, thanks for taking the time to write in this forum! I&#39;m  glad to hear that you&#39;re a huge Devil May Cry fan, like others in these  forums. I&#39;m going to reiterate a few points that I&#39;ve talked about the  past few days. 1) We&#39;ve mentioned that this is obviously a younger  Dante. If you look closely in the trailer, you&#39;ll see that his hair is  partially white. There is a reason for that. A hero is never born a  hero, he is created via a hero&#39;s journey. In Star Wars, you saw Luke  develop into the bad ass that he eventually became. I&#39;m going to leave  it at that and you can interpret that however you&#39;d like. More story  details will be coming soon, so until then, I ask you to be patient. 

I&#39;m sorry if you take this as an insult to the Western audience, seeing  as how Capcom (Japan, Europe, and USA) and Ninja Theory ALL have a hand  in this creative vision. This is a collaboration, not something that has  been done on its own. 

As for smoking, I too, hate smoking. But there are people in the world  who smoke. And there are non-smokers who used to smoke, and non-smokers  who WILL smoke. People change until they decide to give something up OR  take something up. 

I&#39;m not sure where people are getting their information, but Heavenly  Sword was hardly a failure. It currently maintains a 79 score on  Metacritic, which, last time I checked, is pretty positive. It sold over  a million copies on the PS3 and was praised for its cinematics and  gameplay. The main critiques stemmed from the game&#39;s short length,  which, to be honest, is true. It was a bit short for my tastes. 

The upcoming game, Enslaved, looks absolutely GORGEOUS and I,  personally, can&#39;t wait to check it out. Early previews have nothing but  praise for the game, but of course, we don&#39;t know how it will play yet.  I&#39;m looking forward to that experience. 

I hope that you give this new game a chance. If only, let us show you  more (with time) and we can certainly revisit your thoughts and feelings  once more gameplay is shown. &quot; [/b]

            <p>I just remember when DMC4 came out, a lot of people were pissed that you had to play as Nero for most of the time, instead of all Dante or two separate campaigns.  Dante had more variety, yes, but Nero was more fun simply because of what the Devil Bringer brought to the combat.</p>
<p>At least IMO.</p>
<p>And yeah, the story could have been better.</p>

            <p>nah, I mentioned DMC4 as a fun game, despite that I would probably give it shit for crappy plot and characters, plus repetitiveness.<br>
It is one of those titles that just seem to deliver no matter what.</p>

<p>I think that Capcom Forum Guy is 100% correct.  But only on opposite day.</p>
<p>I’m interested in this game, but I’d need to play the first three DMC games.  DMC 4 was pretty fun, and I found Nero to be more fun to play than Dante.  Now all of the hardcore DMC fans will try to gut me &gt;_&gt;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[b]"Hi there, thanks for taking the time to write in this forum! I’m  glad to hear that you’re a huge Devil May Cry fan, like others in these  forums. I’m going to reiterate a few points that I’ve talked about the  past few days. 1) We’ve mentioned that this is obviously a younger  Dante. If you look closely in the trailer, you’ll see that his hair is  partially white. There is a reason for that. A hero is never born a  hero, he is created via a hero’s journey. In Star Wars, you saw Luke  develop into the bad ass that he eventually became. I’m going to leave  it at that and you can interpret that however you’d like. More story  details will be coming soon, so until then, I ask you to be patient.</p>
<p>I’m sorry if you take this as an insult to the Western audience, seeing  as how Capcom (Japan, Europe, and USA) and Ninja Theory ALL have a hand  in this creative vision. This is a collaboration, not something that has  been done on its own.</p>
<p>As for smoking, I too, hate smoking. But there are people in the world  who smoke. And there are non-smokers who used to smoke, and non-smokers  who WILL smoke. People change until they decide to give something up OR  take something up.</p>
<p>I’m not sure where people are getting their information, but Heavenly  Sword was hardly a failure. It currently maintains a 79 score on  Metacritic, which, last time I checked, is pretty positive. It sold over  a million copies on the PS3 and was praised for its cinematics and  gameplay. The main critiques stemmed from the game’s short length,  which, to be honest, is true. It was a bit short for my tastes.</p>
<p>The upcoming game, Enslaved, looks absolutely GORGEOUS and I,  personally, can’t wait to check it out. Early previews have nothing but  praise for the game, but of course, we don’t know how it will play yet.  I’m looking forward to that experience.</p>
<p>I hope that you give this new game a chance. If only, let us show you  more (with time) and we can certainly revisit your thoughts and feelings  once more gameplay is shown. " [/b]</p>
