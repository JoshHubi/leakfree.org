    <title>Source Filmmaker: How to get it?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-filmmaker-how-to-get-it/6075</link>
    <description>K so recently, i&#39;ve been interested in getting source filmmaker, so  i decided that getting it wouldn&#39;t be such a bad idea. 
When i turned to google to figure out how to get it, most of the sites i found said that i would need to install a pirated copy of an 2007 version of tf2 beta in order to use it. 

I have a legit copy of tf2 beta; would that work? Or would i need to find a pirated copy o:?</description>

            <p>valve uses source filmaker for every intro in a source game and in all the meet the movies of tf2. Also you can do a “custom filmaker” with source sdk. It consists on creating an animation on it, spawn a bot in the game of wich you have created that animation place the code of the animation and the name of the bot and it will do it.</p>

            <p>The official Source Filmmaker was only in the original TF2 beta (Before it was released), Valve then removed it from the public.</p>
<p>All source games include the demo smoother which, albeit complex, will allow you to do some of the stuff the film maker can (Look up tutorials for it)</p>

            <p>Well… I once got source filmmaker with youtube.<br>
I got it when I was still a youtuber who doesn’t have steam. I was able to make two films but I’m telling you it’s full of bugs. The bullets come out of the face or stomach and it crashes easily especially if you have lots of apps running in the background. When you taunt… the guns don’t move and stays horizontal like a ghost is holding it.</p>
<p>btw it will not work for the released version.<br>
Source filmmaker was leaked during the TF2 beta so it’s only compatible with the TF2 beta.</p>
<p>I deleted it since I can’t alt-tab to watch youtube tutorials. My comnputer can’t handle it.</p>

            <p>Have you tried it with the legitimate copy? If for some reason you can’t, my suggestion would be to get criminal about it</p>
