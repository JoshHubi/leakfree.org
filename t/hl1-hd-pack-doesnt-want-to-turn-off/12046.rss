    <title>HL1 HD pack doesn&#39;t want to turn off</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl1-hd-pack-doesnt-want-to-turn-off/12046</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing HL1 mods again, and I&#39;ve stumbled upon a problem where in HL and its mods, all of the weapons and models are of the HD pack. Personally, I don&#39;t like the HD pack, and would rather have the classic models. In mods, it also gets in the way of custom models sometimes. Does anyone know how I can purge my HL of those silly &quot;HD&quot; models? Everything I&#39;ve tried so far hasn&#39;t worked.</description>

            <p>Extract the LD models from the half-life GCF, they’re the originals, if you put them in the game or mod folder they’ll override the HD models. Do the same with the sounds and other files to revert all the changes. It might not work with some mods, you’ll have to check whether mods change some of the files.</p>

            <p>Thought I tried that… Guess I’ll try it again and hope for luck.</p>
<p>edit:  Well, the problem seems to be fixed for Half Life, but any mod I play (which is what I really want to do) still has the HD models. Really ruins the aesthetic for the mods.</p>

            <p>And now it seems like it’s set in stone in my Half Life… I was really enjoying playing Half Life and it’s mods… but… I can’t seem to bear it. I wanted to play the classic Redemption mod, but gave up when only the HD models were showing. It just doesn’t match the feel, and it doesn’t give me any nostalgia.</p>

            <p>I’ve always thought that the HD pack guns looked a little cartoonish for some reason.</p>
<p>Also the Beretta is kinda messed up. It’s way wider at the end than it should be.</p>

            <p>The HD pack just feels wrong. It’s not that it doesn’t match the aesthetic of the game that’s established by its low fidelity assets (that’s a problem but it’s not THE problem), its that the models represent everything that is wrong with early 2000s game models. Too much detail in the geometry for the texture resolution limitations to support, but not enough detail to reach the visual goals they were reaching for.</p>

            <p>I’m still not seeing an option… but I’m surprised to see that they went ahead and did that. I don’t know of many people who actually prefer the “HD” pack. It’s not half-lifey enough for me.</p>
<p>I saw a thing on the steam website where you could disable the HD pack. I went ahead and tried to remove it, and it said it was already removed. I figured something was wrong.</p>

            <p>I recently installed Blue Shift and noticed the HD models when I ran Half-Life. I just chalked it up to the Blue Shift installation. Guess I have the actual cause, now. Thankfully Blue Shift has the original models, so while I wait on that update I’ll probably just extract them to the HL folder.</p>

            <p>This has been a problem for a while, actually. I remember running into this years ago on Steam, knowing full well I hadn’t installed the HD pack, and for the life of me didn’t know how to turn it off.</p>

            <p>Wow, I played some HL1 yesterday and the first thought in my mind was “why did I install the HD pack?”</p>
<p>I guess I didn’t.</p>
