            <p>The only problem I have is that some tracks are just short, doubling the length would allow me and others to comprehend it fully.<br>
For example Black Mesa Theme is great, just it ends where I expect it to just kick in.</p>

            <p>I don’t know, somehow I think it should be something a bit more immediately apparent.</p>
<p>Although if I’m being honest, I wasn’t a huge fan of the Blast Pit 3 track to begin with. It just sounds a bit generic compared to the rest of the soundtrack.</p>

            <p>You know, that actually sounds like it would be pretty cool. The player gets used to sneaking past the tentacle (or possibly not), but during the last encounter with it, something makes stealth impossible and suddenly the player has to just run the hell away. It could be a potentially cool “oh shit” moment.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The music is supposed to start as soon as you enter the silo, (after successfully enabling the rocket system) It is timed so that you should easily be able to climb to the top, and hit the button close to when the music changes from ‘rock’ to the ambient ending. (at the 50 second mark)</p>
<p>The problem with this, is people haven’t been running up to the button. Which is something we’ll either need to change, or remove/move the song somewhere else. Although I have some ideas on how to encourage quick movement, and further elevate the tension here.</p>

            <p>For me it started as I approached the bottom of the silo to climb up and hit the fire button.</p>
<p>Oh, and thanks for the insight Joel.  =D  I’ll have to try swapping some files around to see how the atmosphere compares with the original tracks.</p>

<p>Exactly right. They were meant to go where the mesa remixes are set, and just didn’t quite have the right feel. (Which is sort of unfortunate, as a keen listener would pick up that all 3 blast pit songs use the same chord progression. Having to replace it with the blast pit 2 mesa remix wrecked that. Ah well.)</p>

            <p>Personally i love the guitar tacks, they just make some scenes so much more badass.</p>
<p>I remember the part with the tentacle, i messed up and fell to the bottom, which sucked because the track continued playing and i messed up the timing. I promptly killed myself in order to get it right.</p>
<p>As a suggestion for that part, have Blast Pit 2 playing up until you reach the final ladder, at which point BP3 starts, so you can time the guitar part with the launching of the rocket.</p>

            <p>I can understand the controversy with Blast Pit 3.  Personally it worked great for me.  It took me ages to work out how to get past the tentacles on the way down, but on the way back up I knew exactly what I was doing so the whole thing felt very dramatic and triumphant since I got back up there first time, no problems.  However if you mess up or just need to take it slower I can understand the music coming off as awkward.</p>
<p>As said though I have a total musical fetish for using melancholy melodies to give a sense of epicness when there’s nothing really that “sad” happening, so all of Blast Pit’s music was incredibly atmospheric and gorgeous to me.</p>
<p>Oh, if I can ask Joel, what scenes were the unused tracks originally intended for?  Or were they for the same scenes as the Mesa Remixes are used for and you just decided you wanted something more ambient than the very clear melodies and instrumentation of the original versions?</p>

            <p>I absolutely love most of the songs in BM, but I definitely think that Blast Pit 3 song should have been more fitting.</p>
<p>The thing is, the tentacle encounter was meant to be played in a stealthy way to begin with. People can run straight through and dodge them if they want, but that’s usually riskier. Usually the music in the game is there to fit with what you’re doing, or with what is going on. At the end of Blast Pit, it felt like the music was just telling me how to play the area, rather than fit with whatever I was doing. It felt kind of cheesy and overly dramatic, too. I think something more subtle and tense would have fit the situation better (as well as suit multiple play styles), but that’s just my opinion.</p>
<p>There were also some other songs that I thought were great, but not very well time. On the Surface Tension dam, I already killed the soldiers attacking my by the time the music got really exciting, so I was very dramatically recharging my suit and getting more health. Same with the end of Forget About Freeman. Though again, I loved both of those tracks.</p>
<p>And then there’s stuff like Questionable Ethics 1, which was incredibly awesome and perfectly timed. It pumped me up so much that I actually had to take a break when I won the fight in order to cool off. That bit was my favorite part of the whole game, and the music is what really made it.</p>

            <p>Ah, thanks a bunch!  As said when I played through to make my playlist I did a bit of noclipping to skip moments so I might have missed a music trigger or two.</p>

<p>Now I’m done gushing, just an aside, an open question to anyone being as nerdily obsessive about the soundtrack as me.  I blasted through the game with cheats to put all the tracks in chronological order but I think I noclipped past the point that “Office Complex (Mesa Remix)” plays, can anyone confirm for me that it DOES play in Office Complex and not elsewhere (because on my quick, partially noclipping runthrough, no music played in Office Complex to my noticing).</p>
<p>Also were all the Ambience tracks not included in the OST used?  I was considering adding them into my playlist for completionists sake but they’re even harder to pin down!</p>
<p>BMS - Mscl_Ambience2 - plays after “We’ve Got Hostiles”<br>
BMS - Mscl_Ambience7 - plays after “Blast Pit 1”<br>
BMS - Mscl_Ambience8 - plays after “Residue Processing”<br>
BMS - Mscl_Ambience3 - plays after “Lambda Core”<br>
BMS - Mscl_Ambience3 - plays again after BMS - Mscl_Ambience3</p>
<p>Didn’t notice 1, 4, 5 or 6 when speeding through.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They all should be playing in game. Off the top of my head, I think this is where they were placed:</p>
<p>ambience 1 - plays in UC during the crate jump area.<br>
ambience 4 - this is either in the second part of QE or in LC<br>
ambience 5 - plays on your way down into the depths of blast pit<br>
ambience 6 - plays in blast pit before starting up the big fan</p>

            <p>Great work Joel! I’d like to provide some small feedback, my favourite tracks in order:</p>
<p>Questionable Ethics 1 - Best Rock Song, stuck with me the most, the second being Blast Pit 3<br>
On A Rail 1 - epic, would like it more without the lead piano in the chorus<br>
Office Complex (Mesa Remix) - Love the deep electric sound<br>
Blast Pit 1 - Great introduction song<br>
Blast Pit 2 (Mesa Remix) Best emotional song<br>
Black Mesa Theme (Mesa Remix) - The first song I heard when I booted up the game for the first time, awesome<br>
Apprehension (Mesa Remix) - love it and hate it, makes me sad, but I know it’s good, also why does the giant crusher part need to be so emotional? I interpreted it as either emphasising the fact that Gordon’s alone in this giant factory, or that there’s a very good chance he’s about to die in this next obstacle</p>
