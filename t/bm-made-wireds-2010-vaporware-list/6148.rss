<p>I see it before me on some Valve forum:<br>
“Hey Valve, you suck! What were you thinking porting HL to the Source engine, didn’t you realize that, by that, you would create the demand for a better remake that would make longer than 4 years to make, miss a release date and have little to no official updates in 2010, thereby pissing of the fans of the remake and what makes it even harder is that these guys creating the remake are spread all over the world and not live in the same city so it might go faster, and you are also to blame for that Valve because you made Half-Life so good that they all loved it and bought it, DAMN YOU, come on guys at Valve, you should have thought this more through obviously! You should never have released HL and never ported HL to the Source engine.”</p>
<p>In that same logic, if i say i’m going to remake Daikatana because it sucked, and i take a very very very long time to do it, hey don’t ever troll me, go troll John Romero for that fact because, hell, they created the demand so…</p>

            <p>I’m not really sure why you’d say this spawned out of the disappointment with the port of the original to the Source engine, unless the original guy who did this pointed that out.</p>
<p>Personally, I wasn’t disappointed by it. When I heard it would include Half Life Source with some enhancements, I didn’t really have high expectations, since I had already played it and they were simultaneously talking about HL2. My focus was on the new game, not the upgrade.</p>

<p>Way to assert your self awareness, been doing it long?</p>
<p>Anyhow, you did good quoting me but you should at least read and understand the post before making strong comments; now I’m going to make you look foolish.</p>
<p>I never said Half Life Source was a “remake” but Valve did say Half-Life source was “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/280/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">enhanced via source technology</span></a>”;therefore, it contained things that were not in the pre-steam release and thus it was “redone” with the source engine. <span class="bbcode-u">I have a life and don’t feel a need to nit pick </span>what that really meant or describe the hand full of occasions where the “enhancements” could be seen <span class="bbcode-u">the way you feel a need to nit pick </span>over my words, but that’s your right have at it.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the said “enhancements” did not satisfy my expectations or the expectations of others or else this project wouldn’t have a purpose.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t even want to read the rest of your post, after this. Please. Show me a source, where they said that HL Source is going to be remake. You don’t find any? Well, because they never announced a remake. Half Life Source was never announced to be a redone Half Life. They only showed how easy it is, to port things from the GoldSource Engine to the Source Engine. They even showed months before the release the differences between Half Life and Half Life Source. It’s the people’s fault, that they can’t read simple informations about products. Half Life Source was never meant to be a remake. Crappy job? Troll Valve? For what? They just thought, there is no need for a remake of a game. Your post until that part is bullshit.</p>
<p>I just get angry, about this kind of posts, where people make other people responsible for their own faults. Same with the “Portal 2-Related surprise” on the E3 2010, where people were dissappointed that it wasn’t Half Life 2 Episode 3, although Valve said clear “Portal 2 Related-Surprise”.</p>

            <p>Well guys it goes like this…</p>
<p>Valve did a crappy job of getting our hopes up when they “claimed” to have redone Half-Life source with the release of Half-Life 2. I think that <span class="bbcode-b">disappointment</span> is the reason this project even exists, it is a fan based effort to right the fact that <span class="bbcode-u">Valve just rushed something through</span>. Don’t troll the devs here, <span class="bbcode-b">troll Valve</span> for creating the demand for a better product!</p>
<p>I would release my own version if I had the time and the talent; I lack both and suspect many trolls here do too.</p>
<p>With that said, I have seen the recently (Sept2010) leaked screenshots and they looked amazing! The meticulous attention to detail along with the use of lighting effects will make this well worth the wait even if it doesn’t use the same engine as Crysis2 or whatever you guys want to compare it to. I don’t even play Crysis anymore but still play Half-Life so what does that say?</p>
<p>When I finally get to play Black Mesa for the first time, I don’t want to be blown away by the first 2 or 3 levels only to find out that the rest of the project was thrown together and pushed through.</p>
<p>I am glad the devs have stayed the course and allowed the pot to simmer slowly, they know that’s how you get the best texture and flavor out of the meat!</p>
<p>Yes the wait is painful (and we are all hungry) but if it produces a more complete and QUALITY release it will be worth it.</p>
<p>Nay sayers please try to understand.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>No. No, I couldn’t disagree more. MechWarrior is a multiplayer mod. It’s expected to be imperfect and need balance and tweaks.</p>
<p>Black Mesa is all about recapturing the magic and wonder of experiencing Half-Life for the first time. Sure you could play it as a buggy, unfinished mess. And replay it successively as it got better. But by that time the novelty and mystery would be gone, never to return again. And constantly checking online to see if it’s good yet before you play would be spoiler hell.</p>
<p>When I play Black Mesa, I want a Valve level of polish and mastery to suck me in and immerse me in the game world.</p>
<p>Don’t release this thing until it’s done, and done right. I’m just concerned for when that day will come and if they’re on the right track.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hence the need for betas. If you don’t like the concept of a beta, wait for the release. I deliberately didn’t read HLII articles in magazines before it came out to avoid any and all potential spoilers. But I’d prefer a beta of BMS in three months (that then gets polished with full community involvement via suggestion) over the full release either never happening or coming in two years.</p>
