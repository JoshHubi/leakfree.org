Ever notice how people texting at night have that [b]eerie blue glow[/b]?
 Or wake up ready to write down the Next Great Idea, and get blinded  by your computer screen?
  During the day, computer screens look good—they&#39;re designed to [b]look  like the sun[/b]. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn&#39;t be  looking at the sun.

  F.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer&#39;s display adapt  to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day. 
  It&#39;s even possible that you&#39;re staying up too late because of your  computer. You could use f.lux because it makes you sleep better, or you  could just use it just because it makes your computer look better.

            <p>Works great.<br>
So much easier to see the screen in the dark, I don’t need the lights behind me on.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I guess they have a point, but honestly its not for me. I don’t trust random  software and I don’t use my computer all that much in the morning or at night.</p>
<p>Anyways, its kind of cool, some people might enjoy it.</p>

            <p>I’m using this.<br>
started to get tired around normal hours a short while after using it for the first time so the placebo effect worked. then it stopped working (placebo gone).<br>
now I still sit up all night even though I shouldn’t.</p>
