    <description>Not sure if this belongs here, but...

I played Black Mesa before when it was just a mod, and it worked just fine. But now when I&#39;m playing, the graphics look like this:

Is there something I&#39;ve done wrong? I&#39;m pretty sure it isn&#39;t supposed to look like this...any assistance would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>I tried editing and saving the file as you said; it helped on the home screen (because that, too, used to be weird), but the rest of the intro is still all weird and bright like it was before.</p>
<p>I’m playing on a laptop, so…only integrated graphics? At least, I haven’t added any new graphics card, if that’s what you’re talking about (sorry, I’m a tech-noob)</p>

            <p>There are some potential short term fixes for this, until we fix it in a patch.</p>
<p>The game is fullbright and it could be for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Find ‘autoexec’.cfg in SteamApps/common/Black Mesa/bms/cfg and open this file with Notepad</p>
<p>Add the following lines to this file:</p>
<p>mat_dxlevel 95<br>
mat_fullbright 0<br>
mat_hdr_level 2</p>
<p>Save the file and launch the game to see if this fixes your issue.</p>
<p>If you have a graphics card, it is possible your hardware drivers are forcing bms.exe to use the integrated graphics rather than the graphics card. Check in your driver program to make sure bms.exe is set to use the graphics card and not integrated graphics.</p>

            <p>The game is in fullbright, this is an issue that has already been addressed by the devs and will be fixed soon. It’s not an issue with the graphics, just the lighting</p>

            <p>That’s what I mean! I don’t even own the original Half-Life, yet whenever I boot up Black Mesa, it looks like this. I can play the Deathmatch and everything, the graphics are all just…old.</p>
