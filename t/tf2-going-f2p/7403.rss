        <title>TF2 Going F2P?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Orpheon]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Maybe I’m just TF2’d out, but I think I’m finally starting to agree with some of the naysayers of TF2’s new stuff. Up until recently I had no problem with the large variety of weapons and items because their functions were clear and relatively easy to remember, and even then their effects didn’t change gameplay all that much. And generally, everything fit with TF2’s style. I was even happy that there were a lot of hats so that I could usually tell people apart from a distance.</p>
<p>But now, especially with the Deus Ex stuff, it’s starting to feel a little overwhelming. It feels like they’re cranking stuff out too fast for me to get used to. Plus, the effects on the new items are getting rather complex. Also, if the Grordbort’s stuff was debatable as to whether it fit in with TF2’s style, the Deus Ex items can’t even be defended as being suitable. Although they do look pretty cool.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  I dunno. I’ve kind of been on a break from the game for a while, maybe I’ll come back to it later. Or not. Whatever. I played for over 1000 hours, so I’ve gotten my money’s worth in either case.</p>

<p>As far as screwing the customers, yeah, they did a good job, but from a business standpoint, this is smart. some people seem to forget valve is still a business, and from that standpoint, there is nothing wrong with what they did. They game is now supported entirely by a optional system in which you buy items, Mann-co. Sure, it screwed me, as well as many others over who actually bought the game, but i don’t care because i stopped playing over a year ago.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>^This. Plus to upgrade from a F2P to premium all you have to do is buy some shitty 49 cent item from the Mann Co store.</p>
<p>Team Fortress 2 is my favorite game [next to Half Life, of course!] but I don’t get all the, “Whaaaa! Whaaa! The game is ruined forever! It’s going to hell in a handbasket!” talk that’s going on. In fact it’s doing better than ever it seems. I mean, it’s obviously still making tons of money for Valve because they are still updating it. They are laughing to the bank with each new weapon that’s added to the store…or each new game that comes with TF2 weapons. Who the hell would spend fifty bucks on a game they might never play much just to get some items for another game that they do? :aah:</p>
<p>P.S. I bought the game just before it went F2P. Holy shit, I would have saved twenty bucks had I done my research beforehand.  Now I got myself a twenty dollar hat! :facepalm:</p>

<p>Not to say every F2P is bad though, I’ve met a few who were nice and decent enough players. I’m considering doing some coaching though, because they have no clue about TF2’s strategy. -_-</p>

</aside>
<p>They probably never played DoTA then. Worst community/players I ever met on a game. I mean, you got a better chance of winning the lottery than finding a nice person to play with. Valve supposedly developed a system that will reward players who help newbies on DoTA 2. Something is better than nothing. At least they acknowledge that most of the original DoTA players are mean bastards who will kick you for literally no reason. You own the other team. Kicked! You are polite. We can’t have that! Kicked! You start cursing and acting like a immature ten-year old…well, that’s fine with most of 'em, sadly.</p>

            <p>I thought the new 80k+ F2P players were causing all the servers to be down since whenever I checked the server browser, no servers came up. Then it turned out my firewall was blocking TF2. :retard:</p>

            <p>I was playing a day or 2 ago and these F2Ps come in, start making all the BS complaints about how classes/weapons suck, and basically just antagonize everyone, and then when they get told off, they complain about how they expected more of the TF2 community and that we weren’t being nice to new players. Whether they were serious or trolling it was really irritating. Still, overall things seem to be fine. Servers seem to be full more of the time, but it’s usually only during off times that you see a lot of F2Ps, at the peak times the regulars mostly fill it up.</p>
<p>Not to say every F2P is bad though, I’ve met a few who were nice and decent enough players. I’m considering doing some coaching though, because they have no clue about TF2’s strategy. -_-</p>

            <p>When Gabe said they want to convert entertainment as a product to entertainment as a service, I think this is what they mean. By making it free, they’re making TF2 a platform instead of a game, since they’re always going to be updating and fixing it, instead of making a TF3 to correct any errors or gameplay problems.</p>
<p>A good idea in that sense, but a bad idea in the others that everyone has brought up in this thread. We’ll see how it turns out of course.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
