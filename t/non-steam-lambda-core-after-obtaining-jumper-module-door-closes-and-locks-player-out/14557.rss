    <title>[non-Steam] Lambda Core: after obtaining Jumper Module, door closes and locks player out.</title>

    <description>Hello team,

after obtaining the Jumper Module in the chapter Lambda Core I tried it out a little, and went through the corridor, hurtling through the open door. I quickly backed up, and noticed it was closing, then I could not get in any more. This is me stuck in front of the door, can&#39;t go back either ([url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590853220[/url]).
