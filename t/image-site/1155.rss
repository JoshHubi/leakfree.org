    <title>Image Site</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/image-site/1155</link>
    <description>So, I got a stupid idea to set up my own image site, and went through a big ass thread of funny pictures, saving the best from there. Ended up with 280 pictures and 57 gifs. The thing is, I don&#39;t have the slightest of idea about how to set up the site itself. Anyone who has an idea of how to do that, please help the handicap.</description>

            <p>I made a website and stored lots of cool images on it… Check it out, in my sig.</p>
<p>You have two options, either get webhosting (there are alot of cool free ones) or set up a webserver yourself like I did, both can be easy or hard, depending on what you want to do.</p>
