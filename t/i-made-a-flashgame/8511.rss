<p>The sounds are a bit bland and the music drowns them down. The game over screen is pretty dull also.<br>
But overall the game is ok, it is engaging for its simplicity. Although I feel that controls are confusing for a first-time player (at least to me they were, messing my tank movement and missile control keys all the time).<br>
Only having bombs and planes as enemies is indeed a small variety, adding content would be nice. I would also suggest replacing the regenerating health with health drops, it would make the player move around and take risks rather than sitting in the same place and aiming missiles. Well, the plane does shoot at your direction so you have to dodge, but I think it would be fun to make the player move for rewards as well as avoiding punishment.<br>
Are you making money off of this? I’m making a flash game myself as I’m trying to figure out if this is a good way to get a small income while I study.</p>

<p>Excellent suggestions, especially with the health pickup. I think I’ll change that first when I get to it. But I’m not making any money out of this. It’s a student project, I’m using student version softwares so I’m actually not allowed to. But if you’re looking at trying to make some money off of flash, Kongregate has some revenue generating ad programs if your game becomes popular enough, you can also sell/ lisence your games on <a href="http://flashgamelicense.com" rel="nofollow noopener">flashgamelicense.com</a>. A decent game can sell for a few grands on there usually… THough, be careful what contracts you get into if you don’t want to sell your IP entirely. Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Cute. Needs a little but more variation, maybe with some upgrades, but nice concept.</p>

<p>Yarp I hear ya. That was the main complaint I have with the thing myself. I’ll probably add some actual content when I get the time.</p>
