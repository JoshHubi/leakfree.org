    <title>Tentacles are insane</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tentacles-are-insane/13910</link>
    <description>I know you wanted to emphasize distracting them with grenades, but currently there is no way to sneak by them by moving silently because they bang all the time like crazy. I remember in 2012 release, one of the tentacles (the only furthest from me) DID enter an idle stance and it didn&#39;t bang the floors, but a slight itch of movement provoked it into banging again. So it seems that idle behavior is actually coded and intended, but somehow not working correctly.</description>

<p>Well, you have to fix the AI bugs again  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Also, fix the vortiguants’ behaviour. They often get stuck / frozen / do not move nor attack anymore :\ Really odd. In the 2012 mod version, they didn’t have any problem. They moved towards you, attacked you non-stop  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yes, I can also confirm that the tentacles’ AI isn’t performing correctly. At least, not like in the original HL.</p>
<p>Please, fix their AI to actually ignore you while you sneak !!!</p>

            <p>Yes. It doesn’t work as it did in original Half-Life. You can’t sneak past them now. I finally figured out to just throw a grenade to slightly distract them while running like hell to the nearest ladder. Throw another grenade and repeat until you get out.<br>
If this is the intended way to defeat get past them I’m dissapointed.</p>
