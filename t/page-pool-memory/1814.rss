    <title>Page Pool Memory</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/page-pool-memory/1814</link>
    <description>This question is most tailored towards L4D2, but can also be a general question.

Can anyone explain to me what exactly it does? I know it tells the game how much free processing memory it has, and I&#39;ve noticed it seems to let me have smoother gameplay at lower framerates, but what I don&#39;t understand how it effects the actual game. What are the advantages and disadvantages to having it on high versus low? Does it lower the visuals in any noticeable way?</description>

            <p>Ok, it effects load times. I only ask because I have that issue in L4D2 where my performance goes south after a map change. While it fixes by changing any video setting, it’s very annoying and time consuming. Lowing the page pool memory to run smoother at lower framerates seemed to be working as a temporary fix to help it run a little more smoothly with the crap FPS so I wouldn’t have to fiddle with the options every map change.</p>
<p>Hmm… which takes longer, a video options change or a map load…</p>
<p>Edit: BTW, have my questions been in the right section? I’ve been putting them in technology and gaming since they are all questions about technology, but should they have gone into Help and Support?</p>

            <p>It uses some of your HDD as if it were RAM.<br>
Heres an explanation.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory</a></p>
<p>High would speed load times. Keep it high, unless youre low on free memory.<br>
Does not change any application graphically.</p>
<p>Also, go to Control Panel, System, Advanced, Performance Settings, Advanced, Virtual Memory Change, and you can adjust it there for all apps.</p>

            <p>It lets the game use up more of your memory to provide you with better performance.</p>
