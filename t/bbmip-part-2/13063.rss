    <title>BBMIP: Part 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bbmip-part-2/13063</link>
    <description>Ok time for the 2nd part of this blog. 

So we left off somewhere around lab 2. Lab 3 has been done like lab 2 so no need for pictures. The server room got some attention too. AM map B has a lot of replacement models. This starts in the laser hallway. All the models have been replaced, 2 have animated textures. The powersource prop got a major redo. This prop has 5 textures (plus detail textures) because you can climb up on it in AM and UC. When you get to the TC chamber outer room there will be several differences. First you will be greeted by a new guard desk. I took elements from the entry lobby desk and used them in this one. It now as actual security camera angled photos/textures (see next post). The door to the TC &quot;waiting&quot; room or antechamber has been redone also. This was a Propper model that was pretty old. Textures were matched up and I think it turned out nice. There are lots of small details added. When you play the game make sure to check it out. Finally in the antechamber the overhead vent got a redo. Once again it was a brush and lacked detail. Hope you enjoy. Please remember to keep questions limited to these models and their changes in game and not about asking about other features.

<p>No and please try to stay on topic. People tend to think this blog is a place to get all their questions answered. …it’s not. The last thread and this one got a bit off topic. If it keeps doing that I’ll just post and lock the thread.</p>

</aside>
<p>All depends on the model. For the servers I used probably 5-10 reference images pulling bits from each. I made a cabinet and each individual part 1 time then UV mapped them. I then baked a AO map. Then I just copy pasted all the different parts into the final bits. For texturing I the build up layers to get the effect I want. These are sandwiched between either 2 AO layers or UV map outlines or both. CG textures is a great place to find base textures. I usually have Photo shop and toolbag open and switch between them to see how the texture looks. I wasn’t one of the texture artists who learned HL1 era texturing by painting all the highlights and shadows. I usually make the normal map as I go with nDo2 in PS and crazybump. These are also used to render cavity maps and additional AO passes as needed. Then its just light highlights and grunge. Hope that answers your question.</p>

<p>Very nice work Brian, it’s very very cool to see some of the improvements that we’ll see with the next version of Black Mesa. Everything I’ve seen so far is top-notch. I especially like the changes to the servers and the vents (pictures one and five respectively).</p>
<p>I do have a question though. When you’re turning all of this stuff into models, do you start entirely from scratch in whatever model editor you are using and base proportions off of what was already there? Or are you able to convert stuff into mdl files (or whatever file type allows you to edit models - I’m not very modelling-smart) and then tweak it to look better?</p>

</aside>
<p>I have the LD export me a dxf of the prop to be modeled…I either use that as a base depending on the model or just as scale reference. Usually its just for scale.</p>

<p>The reason why the hud is in a darker orange is because it isn’t working properly for the developers.</p>

            <p>The new models are nice, but I actually prefer the aesthetic of some of the old stuff. I can’t put my finger on why though. Also, not sure if I like the darker orange on the hud either. When it comes to game time I probably won’t care much either way, but that’s my two cents for now.</p>

            <p>Make the vent texture darker and change the colours of the new server-texture to look more like the old one … the floor texture on the server picture is a bit too bright imo. liked the colour-sheme of the old version of the room better.</p>

<p>not to mention hl1 is basically a near-future alternate history</p>

 Mr. Someguy:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>If the appearance of the Osprey is any indication, the Black Mesa Incident is 2007 or later, as that was the year the USMC introduced the Osprey for service.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>hl1 was developed around 1997-1998, and it had ospreys as well,</p>
<p>the osprey existed since the 80’s and it was public knowledge. the US <span class="bbcode-b">field trained</span> pilots since 2000</p>
<p>the osprey wasnt deployed into mainstream military until 2007</p>
<p>but one can assume the Black Mesa incident (which i still believe to take place at 2003) was an event of great urgency, that the US had to covertly deploy their ospreys to the HECU and Black Ops before the real deployment</p>
<p>BMS shouldnt be set in 2007 due to the aircraft depicted (which clearly existed long before such a modern time period)</p>
<p>not to mention hl1 is basically a near-future alternate history</p>
<p>the timeline should be 2003, and the appearance of ospreys should be a sign that the US are deeply concerned about the incident at hand and are willing to deploy their new aircraft far ahead of schedule</p>

<p>That sounds a rather weak interpretation. People who notice that inconsistency would just think of a typo. In my opinion, it’d be nice to remove the writing on the door altogether. It feels like an unneeded duplication.</p>

<p>You guys realize it’s like that in the 2012 release and no one said anything lol.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree with everything up to this point. That’s both assuming the HECU is strictly marines, and that events that happened a decade after the games creation are accurate.</p>
<p>You <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> just write it off as Black Mesa =/= Half-Life, and are therefor going with whatever date they want that falls within known canon.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing is that the servers looks pretty and fit the style of the labs.</p>

<p>That server looks purdy.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, do you base your models off of their real-life counter-parts from the '90s era (as Half-Life originally took place in the '90s I believe, someone can correct me if I assumed wrong) or some other source?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>HL1 took place between 2000 and 2009, so it’s right in the middle of the technology boom. AM Labs could either be cutting edge or slightly outdated depending on exactly when, but that doesn’t matter either way because it’s not important. It’s not like they’re running around with tablets or anything, it’s a server room, not really a recent technology. And even if something was out of place, it’d only be a couple years off. Considering we’re dealing with teleportation, interdimentional travel, combat lasers, weaponised tau, weaponized gluons, and holograms, I’m not sure it’s that big of a deal  :3</p>
<p>If the appearance of the Osprey is any indication, the Black Mesa Incident is 2007 or later, as that was the year the USMC introduced the Osprey for service.</p>
<p>And lastly don’t change the servers, they’re my favourite one of the bunch! They look <span class="bbcode-b">fantastic</span>!</p>

<p>well technically the door in HL1 doesn’t say anything on it so it’s open to different interpretations, maybe the room that the door leads to is coded differently from the test chamber itself…</p>

<p>Possible, but it just feels iffy to me.  Just sayin’.</p>
