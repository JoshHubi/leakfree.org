<p>If hammer weren’t fun to some people not nearly as many people would bother learning it. If people were just in it for the money I bet they could find a much better paying job. When I am having a burst of creativity and success in hammer I am having way more fun than I have ever had playing a video game. If it weren’t so hard to do well I’d be mapping 24/7.</p>
<p>The concept is the same: creation through work. The work in minecraft is artificial and easier; slow mining for materials and then a small amount of creativity and skill in making the object. The work in Hammer Editor is real; countless hours spent honing your familiarity with the tools and exercising your creativity. I personally find true accomplishment and skill much more significant than a false one.</p>

            <p>Awards are arbitrary. They are nice to recieve I’m sure, but a poll is hardly going to affect companies like Valve or Blizzard. It is nice however to see the underdog win.<br>
Some get bored of minecraft, some find it addictive beyond compare.</p>
<p>I can say for my part that it was a long time since I played a newly released game that made me feel the same way I did when I was a kid.<br>
Meaning that, now every new game comes with cool features, but it takes us 10 seconds for us to play it to know its limitations. For me, minecraft doesn’t. It leaves all kinds of possibilities open. I think it’s a new concept in a pretty bland market. And I think that’s why they deserve the win.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It goes to show where the majority lies now, though.</p>
<p>I’m betting once the money goes to their heads, they’ll be as bad as Activision. It’s already creeping on Markus Presson. Just read what he writes, try to think inside his head, look at how he’s acted recently. Mojang will be greedy. Maybe not soon, but they will.</p>
