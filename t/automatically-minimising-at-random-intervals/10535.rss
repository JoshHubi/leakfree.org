    <title>Automatically minimising at random intervals.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/automatically-minimising-at-random-intervals/10535</link>
    <description>So basically, when I&#39;m playing it, everything performs great until for some unknown reason, the window minimises itself. So I tried to see if playing it in windowed mode would prevent this. It didn&#39;t work.

If anyone has had the same issue please help me out here.

My specs are:
Windows 7 (64-Bit)
8GB RAM
AMD Bulldozer Hexcore Processor
ATI HD6850 1GB Graphics Card

Any and all help is appreciated.</description>

            <p>Thanks for the help guys but, now it automatically closes the application whenever I try to launch it. I didn’t change anything and I made multiple attempts at it but it was the same result everytime. So I reinstalled it and restarted the computer. Still doesn’t work. I have no idea what I’m doing wrong.</p>

            <p>You’re probably just accidentally triggering the black “SYSTEM INFORMATION” window. That  window has a pesky shortcut that I always seem to find.</p>
