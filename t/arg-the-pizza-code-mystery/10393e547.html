<p>There’s also hexadecimal notation, 50D3A680, though this is for 21/12/12 (12/21/12 for americans) 00:00:00 AM (UTC), maybe it should be in PST? Nevertheless, this ties up with time, with the beginning of the end which was the name given to that date and with 21 goes into 1, the three of the four clues we were given, seems the way to go.</p>
<p>I don’t think the CIA could bruteforce AES 128, not sure if they can now, but we have to keep in mind that it’s been two years since storm said that. Even 3DES would not be outside the realm of possibility, using the keying option with the highest security, it has a key lenght of 192 bits, which translate to 168 bits of practical keylength; and 3DES ties to all the mentions of satan, the divine comedy etc. since it’s DES applied three times, and DES comes from Lucifer. About using IVs, I don’t know, the theory about [ABORTIVE.] in the place of [TERMINAL.] standing for ABORT Initialization VEctor, and therefore use electronic-code-book mode, sounds slick.</p>

<p>I can’t believe we didn’t think of this earlier. I took the first (or last) 8 bytes of the code as the initialization vector in my deciphering program. It didn’t work, but it was definitely worth a try.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I ran a bunch of different pairings and bit sizes through the ciphers mentioned by Storm–Rjindael, Twofish, Serpent, etc.–to no avail.</p>
<p>I think we need to continue to focus on Storm’s last message to me:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Considering a flawed OTP (which it was, considering the ability to analyze it), when done properly should be information-theoretically secure, the next level should be either hyper-encryption using random bits <span class="bbcode-i">(which is unlikely considering the difficulty in making that crackable and for the fact it’s usually used on hardware encryption chips), </span>or some form of Block Cipher (from which if we assume the scale of Levels goes up to 10), can be extended into simple block ciphers with small block size, <span class="bbcode-i">which analysis seems to indicate it is not</span>, <span class="bbcode-u">up to triple cascaded ciphers with high block sizes, salts and perhaps even key files to add additional strength</span>.</span></p>
<p>This last part is huge–we are likely dealing with multiple encryption.  Pulled from this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_encryption" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">page</a>:</p>
<p>[i]With the exception of the one-time pad, no cipher has been theoretically proven to be unbreakable. Furthermore, some recurring properties may be found in the ciphertexts generated by the first cipher. Since those ciphertexts are the plaintexts used by the second cipher, the second cipher may be rendered vulnerable to attacks based on known plaintext properties (see references below).</p>
<p>This is the case when the first layer is a program P that always adds the same string S of characters at the beginning (or end) of all ciphertexts (commonly known as a magic number). When found in a file, the string S allows an operating system to know that the program P has to be launched in order to decrypt the file. This string should be removed before adding a second layer.</p>
<p>To prevent this kind of attack, one can use the method provided by Bruce Schneier in the references below: generate a random pad of the same size of the plaintext, then XOR the plaintext with the pad, resulting in a first ciphertext. Encrypt the pad and the first ciphertext with a different cipher and a different key, resulting in 2 more ciphertexts. Concatenate the last 2 ciphertexts in order to build the final ciphertext. A cryptanalyst must break both ciphers to get any information. This will, however, have the drawback of making the ciphertext twice as long as the original plaintext.</p>
<p>Note, however, that a weak first cipher may merely make a second cipher that is vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack also vulnerable to a known plaintext attack. However, a block cipher must not be vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack to be considered secure. Therefore, the second cipher described above is not secure under that definition, either. Consequently, both ciphers still need to be broken. The attack illustrates why strong assumptions are made about secure block ciphers and ciphers that are even partially broken should never be used.<br>
[/i]</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>[b]I ran the code through a few programs that analyze entropy via auto-correlation, the n gram results indicate a weak encryption, but one that results in highly entropic data (which I correlated against a similar data set size from a randomness extractor) <span class="bbcode-i">when decoded via Hex, which I suspect is a secondary encode</span>, as most encrypted data sent via communications is encoded in order to avoid corruption. This may have skewed the block size analysis done previously (resulting in 376bytes or 64bits).</p>
<p>Code:<br>

<p>If the hex is a secondary encode, then perhaps we are focusing on the wrong data set.  Perhaps this text output is what we should actually be focusing on.  Most decryption methods would allot for a hex OR text input field, but perhaps this will fuel some thought.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Another thing:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Level 8 = OTR 4 - 128bit/256bit block cipher (AES or Rjindael or Twofish or Serpent)<br>
Level 9 = OTR 5 - Cascaded Block Ciphers with salt (SHA 512 or Whirlpool etc)<br>
Level 10 = OTR 6 - Cascaded Block Ciphers with salt and possible key file additions (to increase password strength)<br>
</span></p>
<p>He does not mention a salt for OTR 4–it’s therefore technically possible that we could use rainbow table attacks to determine the key from bits of the code.  In fact, Storm mentioned this himself:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The password will probably be hinted at, perhaps in a less than obvious way. We can assume this much as it is almost impossible to analyze a cipher text with only one message and nothing to confirm patterns. Once I’ve got a rough estimate of what mode/algorithm it uses, I can dedicate some run time to rainbow table attacks on possible key. I have a feeling this is a holding puzzle, designed to allow time to construct further aspects of the ARG or work on whatever is behind their NDA.</span></p>

          <p>I seriously think that he was just bullshitting the whole way through, he probably thought that you knew who he was and decided not to help. AES rainbow tables are just too big, I don’t think they ever exist and much less be available to download.</p>
<p>The code in its text form is the HALOS code encoded with Microsoft-1252/ANSI. If we were to look into that code, that would mean that he padded the message with the hex bytes that have no representation in that encoding, but that would mean that he did not use a block cipher, because is impossible to control the output to not have bytes that are control characters in a certain encoding.</p>

<p>I seriously think that he was just bullshitting the whole way through, he probably thought that you knew who he was and decided not to help. AES rainbow tables are just too big, I don’t think they ever exist and much less be available to download.</p>

<p>I had my suspicions, and I even relayed them to him at one point, yet he continued to offer helpful advice.  Remember, it was his suggestion on the forum that we piece together the story of the ARG–something that has encouraged people to create many of the resources we now have on the Wiki page.  I doubt he would have given me explicit answers, but his suggestion of a 256-bit or similar encryption methodology is probably spot-on.  We simply have need of a key that is obvious enough to fit.</p>
<p>However, I do agree that if it is AES, a rainbow table is not appropriate–especially 256-bit AES.  Nonetheless, if it is not AES and there is no salt . . . technically possible.</p>

<p>Do you have an idea on what size the key should be?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, if it’s AES, then 128, 192, or 256 bits.  If we’re talking something more complicated like Blowfish or Twofish, it could be a pretty large range.  It’s interesting to note that DES is based on the Lucifer algorithm, which relates to our clues (someone may have mentioned this, already).  I doubt it’s DES, as the key size is only 56 bits and someone has probably already tried to brute that.  It’s possible that 3DES is our culprit, though.</p>
<p>EDIT:  If it is 3DES, then we need 3 56-bit keys.  They can be composed in the following manner:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Keying option 1: All three keys are independent.<br>
Keying option 2: K1 and K2 are independent, and K3 = K1.<br>
Keying option 3: All three keys are identical, i.e. K1 = K2 = K3.</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the key could technically be the same for all 3 applications of the algorithm.  If we’re looking at 56-bit key sizes, which is 7 bytes, then it’s entirely possible that our key is a 7-letter word.  There could also be up to 3 individual, 7-byte keys.</p>
<p>Or, in this case, BENALOH, LUCIFER, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>This is all speculation, of course . . . .</p>

          <p>If it was DES then the CIA could crack it really easily. 3DES with keying option 3 is DES,  keying option 2 I don’t know, but I guess they can’t. Since the last bit in each byte is not used, we could have keys of 14, 16, 21 or 24 bytes for DES. For 14 and 21, we would need to turn the key to binary, and insert a bit after each seven bits. I think it was flavrans9 who proposed this long ago.</p>

<p>Voyager - 7 Letters<br>

the 47 Society - 7 Letters</p>
<p>When asked about the significance of the number, Rick Berman once joked, “47 is 42, corrected for inflation” referring to 42 being “the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything” according to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams.</p>
<p>also on the 47 Socierty Website, I went back to November 1998 ( the same month HL1 came out ) they noted in a episode of Voyager,  Janeways access code which was 47 in hexadecimal code.</p>

          <p>Okay, maybe this is stretching, or reaching, or already tread… but what if 21 into 1 is telling us that we need to execute an XOR that would convert 21 into 1 <span class="bbcode-i">before</span> we can decipher the code.</p>
<p>If the “21 into 1” is interpreted as decimal numbers, then that’s XORing the Hex codes against the hexidecimal value 14. The resulting code is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">930B201A159AFD46775C04E16FE939266366F11187E56B980FDE23C002417757045903FC01D60CF4380EB1E3924795658BEACD8F2241712D6ECA3EA7ED13E7E7511110BCE4082E94041D3174D064D9EF42B6F99FD7195E63B0B85FC61223FA2DC4225893...</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, the 21 into 1 could be interpreted as hex numbers itself, then it’s simply XORing against the hex value 20.  The results of this are:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">A73F142E21AEC972436830D55BDD0D125752C525B3D15FAC3BEA17F436754363306D37C835E238C00C3A85D7A673A151BFDEF9BB167545195AFE0A93D927D3D365252488D03C1AA030290540E450EDDB7682CDABE32D6A57848C6BF22617CE19F0166CA7...</code></pre>
<p>Neither of these read as anything directly in ASCII, before anyone wastes time on that.</p>

<p>If it was DES then the CIA could crack it really easily. 3DES with keying option 3 is DES,  keying option 2 I don’t know, but I guess they can’t. Since the last bit in each byte is not used, we could have keys of 14, 16, 21 or 24 bytes for DES. For 14 and 21, we would need to turn the key to binary, and insert a bit after each seven bits. I think it was flavrans9 who proposed this long ago.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Let me elaborate a bit on that.</p>
<p>This is what a DES key looks like on the bit-level:</p>
<p><font face="courier new,courier,monospace">[COLOR=‘Green’]kkkkkkk[COLOR=‘Red’]p [COLOR=‘Green’]kkkkkkk[COLOR=‘Red’]p [COLOR=‘Green’]kkkkkkk[COLOR=‘Red’]p [COLOR=‘Green’]kkkkkkk[COLOR=‘Red’]p [COLOR=‘Green’]kkkkkkk[COLOR=‘Red’]p [COLOR=‘Green’]kkkkkkk[COLOR=‘Red’]p [COLOR=‘Green’]kkkkkkk[COLOR=‘Red’]p [COLOR=‘Green’]kkkkkkk[COLOR=‘Red’]p<br>
</font><br>
[COLOR=‘Green’]k = bits that make up the key material<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]p = parity bits used for error checking (most DES implementations just ignore them)</p>
<p>Now, if the cipher really is DES (or 3DES in which case we have a set of two or three keys), and Storm factored in the use of the parity bits, then maybe we have to arrange the key material so that none of the bits in the key are wasted as parity bits.</p>
<p>There are several ways we can do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If we are starting with a 7, 14 or 21 byte key, we insert a parity bit after every 7 bits (going from left to right), which will give us an 8, 16 or 24 byte key that can be used with DES/3DES.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say we have a password string, 8, 16, or 24 characters long, which is made up of ASCII characters with values &lt; 128 (7-bit ASCII but uses all 8 bits). The leftmost bit (most significant bit) in each byte will be 0. So my idea is that we just remove this redundant bit and insert a bit in the parity bit position instead (for each byte of the key). The easiest way to do this is to bit rotate each byte of the password string one bit position to the left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same as in (2), except that instead of bit rotating, we reverse the bits, either one byte at the time, or the entire bit string of the password, so that the redundant ASCII bits land on the parity bit positions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe this is what the “SEND IN LEVEL SEVEN CASES” means: Use 7-bit ASCII as password input.</p>

<p>I’m not particularly sold on this being homomorphic encryption, because it’s not mature. To be clear, I’m not dismissive of this as a theory, but if I were to rank it on a list of things to try, it’d be close to the bottom.</p>
<p>Not that you have to be an expert on these things, but if you read up about this kind of encryption, you’ll see the same thing in every bit of information out there: it’s not mature, but it’s a promising idea.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, thinking in terms of a puzzle, homomorphic encryption breaking seems <span class="bbcode-i">cruel</span>. I think this might be akin to a rubik’s cube; bit swapping, followed by ground-and-pound BS base128+ encoding, etc.</p>
<p>I think there might be a pun built into the supposed password to HALOS; <span class="bbcode-i">benaloh paillier</span>. The two words individually point to homomorphic encryption, but the first (benaloh) seems punny to me.</p>
<p>I’m posting a <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/endian.3.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">manual page</a> from Linux (same for unix/mac os x) that describes what I’m talking about.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The functions with names of the form “benntoh” convert from big-endian order to host byte order.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The <span class="bbcode-i">be<span class="bbcode-b">nn</span>toh</span> call doesn’t actually exists. The calls are actually <span class="bbcode-i">be16toh</span> or <span class="bbcode-i">be32toh</span>.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand a clear technical point: x86 and x86-64 CPU’s use the little-endian format.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing about DES and TDES (triple DES) algorithms: they expect MSB (big-endian) format. So, what if the bytes in HALOS were converted from MSB -&gt; LSB or MSB -&gt; PDP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Middle-endian" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">middle-endian</a>)</p>
<p>TL: DR; I wouldn’t rule out encryption as a theory, but our bits of data may have been jumbled intentionally which is why everything looks so screwy. We might need to convert this back to MSB…</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that if this is DES, you need a 64-bit key (8 bytes = 8 chars). Only 56-bits of that key are used, but the key needs to match the block size, which with DES is 64-bits. The password may be PAILLIER, or a variant of it…</p>
