<p>Just like Kryptos, some parts were missing or changed to make it look more aesthetically pleasing. so storm probably did it on purpose to make it correct.</p>

<p>The key difference with my idea, compared to Kryptos, is that we‚Äôre using classical cryptography on binary data (binary representation of a password or passphrase) in order to make an encryption key for a modern block cipher.</p>

<p>Maybe ‚Äúlevel seven cases‚Äù means 7-bit ASCII. If the password is BENALOHPAILLIER, and we need to bring pizzas, then maybe ‚ÄúcongratulationsyouwonthePIZZA‚Äù has something to do with it. It has always bugged me how the string is sort of split into a lowercase part and an uppercase part: ‚Äúcongratulationsyouwonthe‚Äù and ‚ÄúPIZZA‚Äù. Interestingly, ‚Äúcongratulationsyouwonthe‚Äù is exactly 24 characters, and 24 * 7 bits = 168 bits.</p>

</aside>
<p>If casing is important, then what about ‚Äú<a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/IRC_clue_6" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ThEpIzZaIsaLiE</a>‚Äù? I mentioned that the case is not switching on every other character, making it look deliberate (or was it an honest mistake on Storm‚Äôs part?). If the point were every-other-character-gets-a-capital-case, then it would read ‚Äú‚Ä¶IsAlIe‚Äù, but it‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Ä¶IsaLiE‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>One explanation might be that he wanted to put emphasis on the ‚Äòlie‚Äô word, by resetting case switching on that word, but that meant making the ‚Äòa‚Äô lowercase also, as ‚ÄúThEpIzZaIsALiE‚Äù doesn‚Äôt emphasize it as much as ‚ÄúThEpIzZaIsaLiE‚Äù. But then again, if he really wanted to emphasize the ‚Äòlie‚Äô word, he could‚Äôve written ‚Äòlie‚Äô in all caps: ‚ÄúThEpIzZaIsaLIE‚Äù. So, I don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p>Maybe it‚Äôs a binary code: If uppercase letters are 1s and lowercase letters are 0s, we get: 10101010100101, which is 10917 in decimal, or 2AA5 in hex.</p>
<p>If the text was much longer, with a more uneven switching of cases, then it might have been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon%27s_cipher" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Baconian cipher</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: I think it may simply be what <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/55443-thewizard99/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@thewizard99</a> said: ‚ÄúThEpIzZaIsaLiE‚Äù looks more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>The key difference with my idea, compared to Kryptos, is that we‚Äôre using classical cryptography on binary data (binary representation of a password or passphrase) in order to make an encryption key for a modern block cipher.</p>

<p>Yeah now you mention it i see what you mean, but the early Kryptos Puzzles for Part 1 and 2 used The Vigen√®re Square as a method to encrypt the message and used a Word and Kryptos as the Keywords/Passwords.</p>
<p>Now Vigenere was a Alphabet based Decryption Method, which means we would not be able to do out unless there was numbers as well. So what if instead of an Alphabet based one, we used HEX instead, 0-9 and A-F. That would also give us 21 in the first line ( 21 into 1) if Benaloh is used.</p>
<p>Also looking into Benaloh/Paillier i found something intresting.</p>
<p>Paillier was named by Pascal Paillier. Pascal is also linked to Pascal‚Äôs Triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure, which looks a lot like the Pizza Jpeg but in numbers. Possible link? Who knows.</p>

          <p>I may have a more direct theory on what HALOS actually is, and how the ‚ÄúHAL‚Äù part is derived.</p>
<p>After reviewing the wiki article about niobium, I noticed the ‚Äúhalides‚Äù portion:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">"Niobium forms halides in the oxidation states of +5 and +4 as well as diverse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonstoichiometric_compound" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">substoichiometric compounds</a>.[sup]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium#cite_note-HollemanAF-37" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">[37]</a>[/sup][sup]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niobium#cite_note-Aguly-40" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">[40]</a>[/sup] The pentahalides (NbX</span><span class="bbcode-b">5) feature octahedral Nb centres.

<p>If you follow the link to the article about oganometallic compounds, you can find information relating to Gilman and Grignard reagents. The former are used to create larger molecules from smaller ones, and the latter are used to make carbon-carbon bonds. Both may be related to the ARG, but I tend to think that the Grignard reagents might be a more likely candidate. I say this because Dr. Bottomley (Storm‚Äôs friend) mentioned something about cloning, and I can‚Äôt help but think that these Grignard reagents might facilitate such a thing.</p>
<p>Granted, there are other ways to go about cloning and forming carbon-carbon bindings, but what if the carbon being used is something else entirely . . . something alien? Is it possible that HALOS is simply a HALide Operating System built with the sole intention of creating some poly-human/alien hybrids? Or perhaps it is simply able to replicate the binding process at such a swift speed that it is able to regenerate limbs or tissue, thus rendering the user invulnerable?</p>
<p>Another thing that could possibly be related to the halide theory is this: <a href="https://halide-lang.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Halide programming language</a>. It seems less likely, but anything is possible.</p>
<p>EDIT: Something that could also be related, and is extremely weird, scary and exciting at the same time, is quantum computing: <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/05/quantum-computing/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Quantum Computing</a></p>
<p>Think about this. We can already bind two subatomic particles and have them change each other, miles apart, through some unseen process faster than the speed of light. Not only does this have huge implications for computers (quibits that can be both 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs) but life and science as a whole.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Important! Something key about that article that stood out to me:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">"It was just a thought experiment until 1994, when mathematician Peter Shor hit upon a killer app: a quantum algorithm that could find the prime factors of massive numbers. Cryptography, the science of making and breaking codes, relies on a quirk of math, which is that </span><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">if yo</span></span><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">u multiply two large prime numbers together, it‚Äôs devilishly hard to break the answer back down into its constituent parts. You need huge amounts of processing power and lots of time. But if you had a quantum computer and Shor‚Äôs algorithm, you could cheat that math‚Äîand destroy all existing cryptography.</span></span> ‚ÄúSuddenly,‚Äù says John Smolin, a quantum computer researcher at IBM, ‚Äúeverybody was into it.‚Äù"</p>
<p>Ringing any bells? Benaloh and Paillier, two cryptosystems that use two prime numbers. Both mentioned in the IRC clues. Hmmmmmmm . . . .</p>

<p>Keep in mind that i wont be able to answer everything as i haven‚Äôt studied everything in that part of science yet.</p>
<p>I am 16 years old and tent to like the physical side of science including physics and chemistry so i could help out with that.</p>
<p>I am a high school sophomore, however most of my knowledge has come from the internet but i haven‚Äôt learned everything yet so i could take advantage of this.</p>
<p>To sum this up i can help you guys with the scientific parts of this ARG as well as the theoretical and cryptography aspects of it as well.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don‚Äôt see where you‚Äôre going with Grignard reagents. While it‚Äôs true that they‚Äôre used as carbon nucleophiles and to create carbon-carbon bonds, there‚Äôs no reason to believe that they‚Äôre useful for cloning and I‚Äôve never heard of them being used in that context. That seems like a big stretch to me.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I‚Äôd like to clear something up regarding ‚Äúspooky action at a distance‚Äù, or quantum entanglement, which you mention at the end of your post. Entangled particles do not technically affect each other‚Äôs spin (they‚Äôre just opposite because the total angular momentum of the universe must stay constant) nor do they enable exchange of information at speeds greater than light, due to the fact that, even though two observers at an arbitrary distance to each other would measure perfectly opposite results of each other, they‚Äôd still both measure random results (since the entangled particles are in a superposition prior to measurement and have a probability to exist in both the up- and the down-state) and thus are unable to transmit any information to the other observer. The measurements are intrinsically random and always result in a total 50% probability of either spin up or spin down when being measured in a direction that is parallel to both spin directions. While quantum entanglement and its implications are still undoubtedly interesting, they‚Äôre not groundbreaking in nature. Bear in mind that this topic is otherwise still very disputed.</p>
<p>Also, despite the fact that quantum computing sounds like an unquestionably revolutionary discovery, it really isn‚Äôt. As you probably already know, qubits (prior to measurement) exist in a superposition with some coefficient representing the relative probability of measuring the particle to be spin-up or spin-down. With a single qubit, we already contain two classical numbers (the two coefficients). If we were to have two qubits, we could write a quantum mechanical state which contains four coefficients, denoting the relative probability of each of the four possible measurements, whereas two classical bits are just that, two classical bits. In fact, generalizing this conversion rate between qubits and classical bits, we can see that N qubits contain 2^(N) classical bits. The catch here is that it is undesirable to have a very complicated state of superpositions as the final computational result, because a superposition cannot be measured. (Mind you, all the coefficients are lost upon measurement) Thus, quantum computers are only superior to classical computers in very intricately and specially designed calculations which exactly fit quantum computers and only result in measurable states such as ‚Üì‚Üì or ‚Üë‚Üë. Coincidentally, integer factorization is one of those calculations using Shor‚Äôs algorithm, which can theoretically be treated as a P-time problem whereas classical computers solve integer factorization with large numbers in NP or sub-exponential time. This obviously relates to some cryptography. EDIT: Ninja‚Äôd.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not assuming nor expecting storm to have gotten this deep into the topics for accuracy‚Äôs sake in the ARG, but I felt this needed revision.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt see where you‚Äôre going with Grignard reagents. While it‚Äôs true that they‚Äôre used as carbon nucleophiles and to create carbon-carbon bonds, there‚Äôs no reason to believe that they‚Äôre useful for cloning and I‚Äôve never heard of them being used in that context. That seems like a big stretch to me.<br>
Furthermore, I‚Äôd like to clear something up regarding ‚Äúspooky action at a distance‚Äù, or quantum entanglement, which you mention at the end of your post. Entangled particles do not technically affect each other‚Äôs spin nor do they enable exchange of information at speeds greater than light, due to the fact that, even though two observers at an arbitrary distance to each other would measure perfectly opposite results of each other, they‚Äôd still both measure random results (since the entangled particles are in a superposition prior to measurement and have a probability to exist in both the up- and the down-state) and thus are unable to transmit any information to the other observer. The measurements are intrinsically random and always result in a total 50% probability of either spin up or spin down. While quantum entanglement and its implications are still undoubtedly interesting, they‚Äôre not groundbreaking in nature. Bear in mind that this topic is otherwise still very disputed.</p>
<p>Also, despite the fact that quantum computing sounds like an unquestionably revolutionary discovery, it really isn‚Äôt. As you probably already know, qubits (prior to measurement) exist in a superposition with some coefficient representing the relative probability of measuring the particle to be spin-up or spin-down. With a single qubit, we already contain two classical numbers (the two coefficients). If we were to have two qubits, we could write a quantum mechanical state which contains four coefficients, denoting the relative probability of each of the four possible measurements, whereas two classical bits are just that, two classical bits. In fact, generalizing this conversion rate between qubits and classical bits, we can see that N qubits contain 2^(N) classical bits. The catch here is that it is undesirable to have a very complicated state of superpositions as the final computational result, because a superposition cannot be measured. (Mind you, all the coefficients are lost upon measurement) Thus, quantum computers are only superior to classical computers in very intricately and specially designed calculations which exactly fit quantum computers and only result in measurable states such as ‚Üì‚Üì or ‚Üë‚Üë. Coincidentally, integer factorization is one of those calculations using Shor‚Äôs algorithm, which can theoretically be treated as a P-time problem whereas classical computers solve integer factorization with large numbers in NP or sub-exponential time. This obviously relates to some cryptography. EDIT: Ninja‚Äôd.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not assuming nor expecting storm to have gotten this deep into the topics for accuracy‚Äôs sake in the ARG, but I felt this needed revision.</p>

<p>Thanks for clearing some of this up‚ÄìI‚Äôm not too keen on the science aspect, I‚Äôm merely looking for ways that the mention of niobium and AI could somehow relate to a greater picture. Time and time again, Storm has told us to look at the story, and there must be a reason for that. The prime number piece is what interests me most about that entire article‚Äìthe science aspect just adds icing to the cake. Considering the ARG is based in a fantastical universe about transporting aliens across space and time, I‚Äôm not too worried about the ‚Äúhard‚Äù science of it all. That said, I definitely appreciate the modifications, as we want to stop up as many rabbit holes as we can.</p>
<p>EDIT: I know that ‚ÄúVictor‚Äù was a reference to the codename of the operative for the VIC cipher, but the fact that it is also used to name the initial party in quantum entanglement is just weird.</p>

<p>If you follow the link to the article about oganometallic compounds, you can find information relating to Gilman and Grignard reagents.

Both may be related to the ARG, but I tend to think that the Grignard reagents might be a more likely candidate. I say this because Dr. Bottomley (Storm‚Äôs friend) mentioned something about cloning, and I can‚Äôt help but think that these Grignard reagents might facilitate such a thing.</p>
<p>Granted, there are other ways to go about cloning and forming carbon-carbon bindings, but what if the carbon being used is something else entirely . . . something alien? Is it possible that HALOS is simply a HALide Operating System built with the sole intention of creating some poly-human/alien hybrids?

<ol>
<li>The message on the ‚ÄúLIES.jpg‚Äù image that says ‚ÄúSteals it, eats it‚Äù and mentions Stone will pay is a direct reference to the board‚Äôs message: ‚ÄúAnthony - please stop stealing my pizzas!‚Äù</li>
<li>The pie chart lists Lab D (optronics) as the biggest budget sink‚Äìthis is a direct reference to our last gate puzzle.</li>
<li>The red dashed line is so obvious as to be a blaring neon sign. Below, it clearly says ‚Äúcode‚Äù and says to use cascade ciphers only. Now, Storm directly messaged me (posing as 0418) that he thought it would be one of those, but I think he may have simply been pointing me/us toward this whiteboard. I think the true answer lies within the RSA on the board, and this was simply another arrow pointing toward it.</li>
<li>The RSA encryption suggestion on the board is a direct reference to our ‚ÄúBENALOHPAILLIER‚Äù hint. Unpadded RSA is partially homomorphic, and both Benaloh and Paillier are homomorphic cryptosystems.</li>
<li>The message at the bottom of the whiteboard is exactly 1024 bits (128 bytes) if you include punctuation and remove spaces: <span class="bbcode-b">Note :s pecimentransfermonday09:00lambdacomplexplatform2lowersection-biodome-beawarelocationisstillunderconstruction-wearahardhat! </span>This may pointing us directly at RSA as the method for solving the hex code, but it could also be a coincidence.</li>
<li>Storm mentioned that he thought the hex was a secondary encode. This would make sense if the RSA method is used, for the initial ciphtertext output would be in numerical format.</li>
<li>Storm also mentioned that the CIA couldn‚Äôt bruteforce it. Some traditional symmetric ciphers can‚Äôt legitimately be bruteforced, but neither can RSA.<br>
The key problem I see with this method is that our key would need to be quite large, at least 4096 bits. This is because the size of the ciphertext is quite large, and in traditional RSA the message cannot be longer than the key size (and is 11 bytes shorter with padding). Or, we may be dealing with hybrid encryption, wherein the message itself is encrypted with a block cipher, but the key is encrypted with RSA.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever the case, I know for a fact that this whiteboard holds our answer.<br>
‚Ä¶^^^<br>
EDIT: I figured if I sounded confident enough, the ARG would break and reveal its answers to us.</p>

          <p>Good call, man. Taking a look at them . . .</p>
<p><a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Whiteboards?file=C2a4x_labboard2.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This one</a> is important for a couple of main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It mentions isotopes of promethium/neodymium being unstable, which may be referenced by the <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Tempus_omnia_revelant" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">list of isotopes of niobium</a> that were posted on the wiki.</li>
<li>We already know that Storm was proud of the Laser Optronic Linear Inducer Cannon (so much so that he <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/User:Stormseeker" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">trademarked it in his BM wiki profile</a>) and that it was used to solve Code D. On this board, we have ‚ÄúAccelerated Lepton Optronic Linearity Cannon.‚Äù</li>
<li>We also have a (possibly coincidental) reference to niobium with the message to the right of the board: ‚ÄúPossibility of <span class="bbcode-b">quantum pulse detonation</span>.‚Äù We already mentioned before that niobium is used in quantum computers. It also mentions Dr. Welsh is looking into it with an odd ellipse (" . . . ") at the end.<br>
The <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Whiteboards?file=C2a4x_labboard5.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">whiteboard you mentioned</a> also has some key reasons it might be important:</li>
<li>It too mentions leptons.</li>
<li>The Higgs-TauTau is a reference to the Higgs boson and its decay into tau leptons. Furthermore, the cannon is also called the ‚ÄúTau cannon.‚Äù</li>
<li>Yet another reference to the cannon: ‚ÄúInteresting side effect of neodymium optronic causeators‚Äù‚ÄìI‚Äôm pretty sure it says ‚Äúcauseators,‚Äù but it might be some other word.<br>
<a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Whiteboards?file=C0a1x_labboard_am1.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This board</a> also particularly interests me for three key reasons:</li>
<li>It has a note directed at Paul Bottomley about the Niobium 5 needed for that ‚ÄúAI project thingy.‚Äù I know we have noted this before, but have we ever bothered to take a look at the rest of the whiteboard?</li>
<li>It makes mention of the EP-0021.</li>
<li>The extension is split into two by the period. Both of the numbers ‚Äú1187‚Äù and ‚Äú463‚Äù are apparently prime‚Äìat least if the <a href="https://www.archimedes-lab.org/primOmatic.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">prime calculator</a> I‚Äôm using is to be believed.<br>
The extension 01433 (assuming it is 01433, it could also be 01633) listed on the <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Whiteboards?file=C2a4x_labboard15.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">budget whiteboard</a> is also prime‚Äìagain, at least according to the calculator.</li>
</ol>
<p>That leaves us with three prime numbers: 1187, 463 and 1433. If any of these are not prime and the calculator was wrong, please let me know. I‚Äôll do some experimenting with these numbers to see if I get anything interesting.</p>
<p>EDIT: Don‚Äôt forget that the first 8-digit segment of the Codes A - D number is also prime: 10010851.</p>
<p>The only problem with these numbers is that they don‚Äôt produce an N anywhere near large enough to encode the entirety of the hex file. Not even close.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT2: I think this is the most significant issue with this portion of the ARG. Having tough puzzles like the one Storm mentioned in the IRC channel‚Äìwherein cockroaches crawling on the ground in one portion of the ARG he attempted created an image when their movements were mapped‚Äìare a great way of fueling and maintaining interest in an ARG. I imagine something pointed to that section of the game in some way, and it then became a matter of determining <span class="bbcode-i">why </span>and <span class="bbcode-i">how</span> those cockroaches were important. I sincerely don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm complaining here, and I hate to say it, but I think this portion of the ARG has become too <span class="bbcode-i">synthetically</span> hard; and it‚Äôs not for lack of design choice on Storm‚Äôs part. Rather, it‚Äôs our own faults. We have developed so many ideas and dug up so much information that we have weighed ourselves down with countless possibilities. Every attempt I have made to circumvent all the ideas and start at square one has ended with me thinking, ‚ÄúWell, what about this portion? How about that idea? Did we try X . . . Y . . . Z?‚Äù In other words, we have created a monster that will be, quite frankly, impossible to solve without the creator helping us eliminate some threads. I don‚Äôt know if and how he might do this, but I sincerely doubt we are going to make headway without it.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The other reason for this is that we are potentially dealing with heavy-handed cryptography. We are dealing with something that cannot be partially decrypted with guesswork (like the OTP puzzle)‚Äìwe either nail it down 100% or we fail with 0%. At least with that cockroach puzzle, even as incredibly difficult as I‚Äôm sure it was to figure out the method, a partial image constructed by accident from the movements still would have produced <span class="bbcode-i">something</span>. Again, I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm complaining‚Äìthis is not Storm‚Äôs fault in the slightest, but a conundrum created by our own shared ambitions. However, I sincerely hope that the next puzzles are a little more geared towards puzzles that cannot be accidentally corrupted by sheer number of minds involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In essence, I believe that a ‚Äúreboot‚Äù of sorts, or a set of directions that re-targets our efforts, is definitely in order. Again, I don‚Äôt want Storm to be irritated by what I‚Äôm saying‚ÄìI‚Äôm not complaining that the ARG itself is too hard, just that we have created something so huge that we can‚Äôt possibly constrain it to fit our process of determining a valid solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">My very first ARG was in the <a href="https://www.idg.com/www/pr.nsf/18db32998e2cabca8525791e005681a9/5a26c37f8cef96ea88256cc3005ba622!OpenDocument" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">March issue of GamePro</a> back in 2003. The GamePro Enigma spanned the entire magazine and had a couple small online elements, yet the fact is that it was contained within the magazine itself. Although anything and everything within that magazine could be a part of the greater puzzle, there was no trepidation that some random outside information was needed. I managed to solve it far before the cutoff date (the answer was ‚Äúsyzygy‚Äù), but it definitely took a lot of backtracking, double-checking and guesswork. That, to me, is what makes these things so damn fun. You never know that you‚Äôre on the right track until you get the chance to check your work‚Äìand then you realize what you‚Äôve accomplished! Solving Code D was like a huge breath of fresh air, and my heart was pumping so hard when I wrote that post those few years ago. I really want that feeling again, and I know we can do it. We simply need to create a construct that we can work within knowing (at least partially) that the answers we need are contained within it‚Äìand we may need help doing that. Determining the answer by diligently chipping away at something is one thing, but randomly guessing and checking (without at least some direction) is something else entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Storm, I love you. Please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way. Again‚Äìnot your fault, man.</span></p>

          <p>Great analysis Gunsrequiem.</p>
<p>I do feel that we might have overlooked the information in many of these white boards.</p>
<p>As a result, i do feel that there is still some something undiscovered in Questionable Ethics as well as in the other chapters.</p>
<p>Another thing, this is the first ARG that i have participated in and so far it has been a very fun time being here.</p>
