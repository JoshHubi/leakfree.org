<p>ECB mode is the simplest mode of operation that can be used with a block cipher. Other modes use a so-called initialization vector (IV) which is unknown to us. However, it is possible that the IV is part of the (hex decoded) code, for example the first or the last block could be the IV. The IV doesn’t have to be secret, and it is therefore often sent along with the encrypted data.</p>
<p>If Storm used a block cipher in ECB mode, then we can most likely rule out 128-bit (and larger) block ciphers, because 16 (128 bit) doesn’t evenly divide 376. This is assuming the coded data is complete and nothing is missing from the code.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it is a 128-bit block cipher, then we can rule out ECB mode and we need to look at the stream cipher modes CFB, OFB and CTR.</p>
<p>The CTR mode is a bit different from the others in that it uses a counter which is incremented for each block. The initial counter is usually initialized with an IV like the other IV-based modes. In some cases this counter is split in half where the left half is initialized with a value called a nonce, and the right part is initialized to 0 or 1. For a 128-bit block cipher the nonce could be 8 bytes, and maybe the first 8 bytes of the code is the nonce.</p>
<p>Ever since the block cipher idea was suggested, the problems has always been determining the block cipher, block size, mode of operation, possible IV and key size. And then there is the question of how to transform a possible password to an actual key that can be used with the block cipher. This transformation is usually done with a key derivation function, which in the simplest form can be a simple hash function. Or, the key is simply the ASCII encoding of the password, padded or truncated to match the key length.</p>
<p>DES and TripleDES have an additional complication in that the key have bits that are not part of the actual key bits. These bits are called parity bits and are used for detecting simple bit errors.</p>
<p>One thing that has stuck out to me from 0418_08151814’s PM to Guns, is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ran the code through a few programs that analyze entropy via auto-correlation, the n gram results indicate a weak encryption, but one that results in highly entropic data (which I correlated against a similar data set size from a randomness extractor) when decoded via Hex, which I suspect is a secondary encode, as most encrypted data sent via communications is encoded in order to avoid corruption. This may have skewed the block size analysis done previously (resulting in 376bytes or 64bits).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know if 0418_08151814 ever mentioned 64-bit block ciphers in earlier PMs to Gunsrequiem, but it is curious that he briefly mentions the block size analysis resulting in 64 bits, but then completely omits 64-bit ciphers from his discussion and only brings up 128-bit and 256-bit block ciphers. For example:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="0418_08151814">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt="" width="20" height="20" src="../../letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/0/bc8723/40.png" class="avatar"> 0418_08151814:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>It is just an assumption, but one using the available evidence, OTR 4.0 is either a 128bit or 256bit block cipher with an unknown mode and key length. I would assume AES or Rjindael as candidates to allow for the most commonly used (also as Off the Record encryption uses AES as its base algorithm, that may be a hint).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But later, he says:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="0418_08151814">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt="" width="20" height="20" src="../../letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/0/bc8723/40.png" class="avatar"> 0418_08151814:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>For the moment therefore, I will continue to try and analyze the non Hex code and work out the block size, algorithm basis, key length etc.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Maybe he is actually telling us exactly what we need to do here, and that we shouldn’t blindly trust everything he saying in his PM, but trust our own analysis of the code, work out the block size, modes and key lengths, and while doing so, we should probably make a few assumptions that might help narrow things down a bit, and work our way out from that.</p>
<p>One of the assumptions we could make is that the code is complete and isn’t missing any parts. However, there are clues that contradict this. For example, what if [ABORTIVE.] and the “data corruption” in other clues means that the code has been cut off at the end? We can still decrypt the partial message, but it means that any block size analysis is meaningless. So, we are back to square one.</p>
<p>We can choose to trust 0418_08151814’s suggestion that it is either 128- or 256-bit AES or Rijndael. But then in another hint we find: “Don’t trust anyone, it’s not safe.”</p>
<p>So, there are a lot of unknown variables that we just can’t seem to figure out or narrow down.</p>

<p>Great stuff here, man!</p>
<p>Here’s the thing–those PM’s came at a time when Storm already knew that I was suspicious of Code_ /0418.  Here’s the rest of the messages following up to that point:</p>
<p>"Code_,</p>
<p>I previously mentioned that the “seek out Code_ he is watching” message may have pertained to you, but I never went through with actually attempting to do so. On a whim, and after reviewing the lack of progress while I have been preoccupied with school, I decided to message you and see if you have any correlation with the ARG.</p>
<p>I refuse to give up until I see this thing put to bed, and I’ll pursue all venues and investigate as much as possible while I have time this summer in an attempt to see it through.</p>
<p>You’ve been a stellar help in the past, and I only hope you can continue to be.</p>
<p>~Gun"</p>
<p>“Hey, sorry I’ve been super busy with things recently. I don’t have a huge amount of time, but I’ll look into it. I’ve got a few too many things on my plate at the moment, what with a new project I’ve just been put in charge of at work, but I’ll see if i can analyse this code somewhat and work out what it’s likely to be.”</p>
<p>Take your time, man. Been a bit busy myself lately, so completely understand where you’re coming from.</p>
<p>Hope all is well, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>~Gun</p>
<p>The message after that last was the message that I shared with you all.  Now, I mentioned to Code_ after the SECOM solution that I wasn’t sure how we was so keen on specific details, but that I would not blow any whistles and would consider him another bystander–like the rest of us.  It was not until Storm posted the “seek out Code_” message, and after another long bout of no success, that I explicitly asked him.  He never mentioned my inquiry, but his response, as you’ve all seen, was still extremely helpful.  Other users had mentioned similar thoughts, but it never went anywhere beyond speculation.  Once the forum finally found out for sure that 0418 was actually “Dr. Horn”, I figured that the messages were worth sharing.</p>
<p>The point behind my rambling is that Storm knew that I was onto him before his last message to me, but he still provided the examination you see in the long message.  Therefore, analyzing it further, as flavrans9 has done, isn’t necessarily a bad idea.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible that something further is hidden within.</p>
<p>The original PM’s are <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Stormseeker#0418_08151814.27s_PMs_to_Gunsrequiem" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></p>
<p>EDIT:  Something bugs me about this part of the message:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">"I ran the code through a few programs that analyze entropy via auto-correlation, the n gram results indicate a weak encryption, but one that results in highly entropic data (which I correlated against a similar data set size from a randomness extractor) when decoded via Hex, which I suspect is a secondary encode, as most encrypted data sent via communications is encoded in order to avoid corruption.

<p>Wait, wait, wait.  He says right here that he suspects the hex encoding was a secondary encode, which would mean we’re not meant to look at the actual hex portion of it, but the decrypted portion.  In the original message, he even refers to the hex-decoded portion as the “code”:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">"</span><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Code:</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">³+�:5ºÝfW|$ÁOÉCFÑ1§ÅK¸/þà"aWw?$y#Ü!ö,Ô.‘Ã²gµE«Êí¯aQ</span></span><br>

<p>This code is only 335 characters, a far cry from our 376-byte hex equivalent.  As he said in that quote, the hex encode was probably a secondary method simply to reduce corruption, which thereby skewed the block size analysis.  Couldn’t we, theoretically, break this into chunks or rework it to create an entirely different hex code(s)?</p>
<p>If the hex code is what we are supposed to be looking at, I have some further thoughts regarding decryption.  I know everyone is hung up on AES encryption methods, but is it possible we could be dealing with 3DES?  This would utilize up to three different 56-bit (7 character) keys, and we have quite a few of those available.  Not to mention we have been seeing many references to the number 7.  Just off the top of my head, here are some possible keys: BENALOH, NIOBIUM, HALOSAI (the AI part was bold on the <span class="bbcode-i">Tempus</span> page), and I’m sure we could find many others.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-s">EDIT 2:  I ran a 3DES decryption on the hex code with “HALOSai” as the key, and ended up with this:</span><br>

<span class="bbcode-s">It’s not very much to go on, and it could be a fluke, but the “dye” and “helus” caught my attention.  Is it even possible to get a partial result without the full key implemented?</span></p>
<p>Also, IRC Clue 6’s capitalization has to come in somewhere, seeing as how the key input is contingent upon capitalization:</p>

<p>EDIT 3:  As a final note before (probably) cashing in for the night, I’ve added a Cryptographic Functions table to the wiki to make it easier to see what the size of keys and IV’s are for various functions:  <a href="https://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Cryptographic_Functions" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Cryptographic Functions</a></p>

<p>Well, I don’t really have any specific tools that I <span class="bbcode-i">know </span>work–I have to rely on online decryption tools.  That was done utilizing this one: <a href="https://codebeautify.org/encrypt-decrypt" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Code Beautify</a></p>
<p>It’s possible it doesn’t really work.  I meant to ask about that, actually–I know faed was working on some  open ssl decrypters, and I was wondering if anyone would be willing to provide some more information on how those work, or provide an online one that is verified.  It’s frustrating not knowing whether or not the tool you’re using really works.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s the key problem with these damn online tools.  Do you have anything you might recommend, faed?  I recall in the earlier stages of the hex code that you were providing some open ssl decryption methods–any chance you have kept up with them?</p>

<p>Thanks, man!  Y’know, even though I’ve spent the last few years learning about different ciphers and can spout them off like the alphabet, there are still so many intricacies that I don’t fully understand yet.  As you can see from this case, I’m fine digging for clues and applying different methods to the hex code, but I’m forced to utilize tools that have already been created.  In that sense, I am completely out of my league.  Of course, the ARG isn’t meant to be easy, so I’m definitely not complaining.  It’s simply frustrating thinking that I can’t make the same connections to the ARG clues as someone with cryptography implementation experience.</p>

<p>Well, I don’t really have any specific tools that I <span class="bbcode-i">know </span>work–I have to rely on online decryption tools.  That was done utilizing this one: <a href="https://codebeautify.org/encrypt-decrypt" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Code Beautify</a><br>
It’s possible it doesn’t really work.  I meant to ask about that, actually–I know faed was working on some  open ssl decrypters, and I was wondering if anyone would be willing to provide some more information on how those work, or provide an online one that is verified.  It’s frustrating not knowing whether or not the tool you’re using really works.</p>

</aside>
<p>For online based:</p>
<p>AsciiToHex: <a href="https://www.asciitohex.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.asciitohex.com/</a> - Simple conversion tool, doesn’t actually encrypt or decypt, but simply converts a variety of encodings to ascii (as well as others). Useful for Base64, unencrypted hex, decimal, binary, and Rot13.</p>
<p>Tools4Noobs: <a href="https://www.tools4noobs.com/online_tools/decrypt/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.tools4noobs.com/online_tools/decrypt/</a> - Supports multiple Rjindael’s, TwoFish, BlowFish, DES, Serpent, and supports Base64 and Hex input.</p>
<p>online-domain-tools: <a href="https://aes.online-domain-tools.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://aes.online-domain-tools.com/</a> - I tried decypting the 752 with this for a while, it works pretty well. 3DES, DES, BlowFish, TwoFish, Serpent, Rjindael 256. It supports hex and plain text input.</p>
<p>For software based cyptographic:</p>
<p>Obviously OpenSSL, but without the GUI it’s difficult to use. <a href="https://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html</a></p>

<p>JcrypTool (Linux, Mac, Windows): <a href="https://www.cryptool.org/en/jcryptool-en" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.cryptool.org/en/jcryptool-en</a> - Doesn’t support DES, 3DES, TwoFish. It is much more limited, but is under major development. It’s major benefits are fantastic analytic tools, and is being update regularly.</p>
<p>Other than those two, I haven’t found any other software based cryptographic tools.</p>

          <p>Astij:  Yes, and that’s something that I will rectify in my forthcoming attempts.  I didn’t realize that the spaces would prompt different results, but apparently they do (at least in the case of that tool).</p>
<p>DeathTBO: Thanks for this.  I feel good knowing that folks like you, faed, flavrans9, CPU and others are a part of this.  TOGETHER, WE CAN SOLVE THIS.</p>
<p>EDIT:  BTW, this CrypTool2 is goddamned fantastic.  Where has it been all this time???</p>
<p>I am truly impressed by this.  I can set it up so I’m running multiple decryption attacks at once, whilst simply changing the key and looking for solid results.  Man, I can’t believe how hard I’ve made it on myself these past years.</p>

<p>I think that’s just because the conversion from hex to the ASCII version results in the loss of some bits.  I converted the original hex code to ASCII and received the same output as Code_'s in the PM.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’ve been doing some searching on that strange number sequence to calculate when the “aren’t you alone…” is pasted again into the console. It’s strange, it turned up a chart relating to Crystallography.</p>
<p>I speculated that AI5BM was probably one of the rooms in the QE labs, and it was intended to be a trailhead to find the first in game clue for the “newer” players. I say that the whole Warning Message, the All Clear Page and everything is for that and its just another thing for us to look at to get in to the ARG rather than it being PART of the ARG.</p>
<p>As for the Crystallography no idea, but the “Arent you alone” is probably linking to this guy <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Nihilanth" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Nihilanth</a></p>

<p>I know that “Aren’t you alone” is linking to Nihilanth god damn it, I’m not stupid.</p>
