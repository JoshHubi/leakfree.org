    <title>[ARG] The Pizza Code Mystery</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/arg-the-pizza-code-mystery/10393</link>
    <description>I made a thread about this on reddit, read [url=&#39;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMesaSource/comments/zysx7/the_black_mesa_source_arg/&#39;]here[/url]. It basically started when I found [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/cIc3a.jpg&#39;]this code[/url] behind a malfunctioning door. 

Here is the info copy-pasted from my reddit post.
------------------------------------------------
[b]What do we have now?[/b]

In [url=&#39;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMesaSource/comments/zxyt7/lets_get_cracking/&#39;]this thread[/url] I posted a picture of some code that is found behind an inaccessible door. The users [url=&#39;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMesaSource/comments/zxyt7/lets_get_cracking/c68oe4t&#39;]MrMuffins[/url] and [url=&#39;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMesaSource/comments/zxyt7/lets_get_cracking/c68oesa&#39;]bradcah[/url] did good job recognizing the type of code used and what it says:  

    I have hidden four  
    codes abcd for access  
    to my S.F.T.E [possibly acronym for Society of Flight Test Engineers]-dr bon ami [good friend]  
    code a  
    one zero zero one

or  

    &quot;I have hidden four / codes &#39;abcd&#39; for access / to my &#39;SFTE&#39; - DRBONAMI / codes / ONE ZERO ZERO ONE&quot;

User [url=&#39;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMesaSource/comments/zxyt7/lets_get_cracking/c68uzsu&#39;]unhi apparently gives confirmation that this is indeed an ARG[/url], but the first and easiest code found is not yet completely cracked. He also found [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/RtmBn.jpg&#39;]another potential code[/url] and did [url=&#39;https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMesaSource/comments/zxyt7/lets_get_cracking/c68vff3&#39;]some detective work[/url].

It seems to revolve around pizzas. There is one of the pizza-heavy [url=&#39;https://imgur.com/a/QluRI&#39;]secret rooms[/url]. There are other secret rooms containing pizza.

[b]How can you help?[/b]
[b][u]NOTE: involves cheats, so not everyone will like it! [/u][/b]
We need to find the other 3 codes, and any potential clues around. I&#39;m on chapter 8 or 9, so I probably missed a lot. If you feel like exploring secret rooms, this is how I do it:  
- Open options panel -&gt; keyboard -&gt; advanced -&gt; enable developer console.  
- Open the developer console with whatever key you have it set in they keyboard settings panel of the game.  
- When starting up the game (every time you start it) type in console &quot;sv_cheats 1&quot; to enable the use of cheats. This command by itself does not alter your game experience.  
- Type in console &quot;bind n noclip&quot;. You can chose any key you want instead of &quot;n&quot;. Pressing the key will toggle noclip.  
Be reasonable with noclip! Don&#39;t cheat, don&#39;t spoil yourself, don&#39;t get stuck; quicksave before exploring, as some areas will instakill you if you noclip there; going too far crashes the game.

Of most interest are locked/broken doors that apparently have rooms on the other side. You can also try inaccessible catwalks and observation rooms, but be sure not to go somewhere that you should be later on in the game and spoil what lies ahead.


I will update this post as new information arrives.</description>

            <p>Good Afternoon. I have sat down ,after playing through Black Mesa again, and have found this thread on the forums. I have become enraptured by this community and it’s response to this ARG, and wish to lend a hand anyway I can. But that’s just the thing I am unsure how to proceed and would greatly appreciate one of you fine scientists either assigning me a task or giving me some direction. I will check back on this page daily to see if I can be of some use regardless.</p>
<p>Your’s Faithfully<br>

<p>"21 into 1" is a hint given to us by Stormseeker. It was first discovered when it was posted on the bmrf.us wiki page on the 26th of August, 2014, accompanied by another hint "This unlocks at the start of the end". It was given to us by the same wiki...</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>Discord PM I sent to Stormseeker on 11/27:</strong><br>
<em>You have to feel sorry for Dr Horn. He discovered he was nothing more than a character in a video game</em></p>
<p><strong>Response received 30 minutes later:</strong><br>
<em>that is essentially it yes</em></p>
<p>Since we know that Dr Horn knows he’s a character in a video game we could assume that he’s trying to escape from it and enter “the real world”.</p>
<p>He thinks he can accomplish that by fixing his broken Asura Gate with the exotic material he spoke of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>([LD] Stormseeker11/20/2019<br>
exotic matter is theoretically used in the seeding of lorentzian wormholes<br>
ie - portals)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then attaining the 2 missing additional coordinates he mentions on his whiteboard.</p>
<p>The two that he needs are coordinates that exist in OUR world. This would guarantee his escape from the game and entrance into what we call the real world.</p>
<p>Questions Remaining:<br>
1.Are we the ones who will be expected to bring the exotic material that’s needed to repair the Asura Gate?<br>
2. What will we interact with, probably in X01/X02, in order to supply either our actual home coordinates or perhaps the coordinates of our favorite local Pizza place that delivers?</p>
<p>That would be the “small reward” that he promised!</p>

            <p>This is cross-posted from discord and is a follow-up to my recent post where I was looking at the recently leaked photo. In this post, I will talk a bit about the partially obscured page, which I didn’t cover in my post above.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2a16ac52001cfbe85c26b66b6369513094d683bc.jpeg" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/2a16ac52001cfbe85c26b66b6369513094d683bc" title=""><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2a16ac52001cfbe85c26b66b6369513094d683bc_2_690x388.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="60kD6rjTHWMLdJKgp2a8TFxW4Z6" width="690" height="388" srcset="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2a16ac52001cfbe85c26b66b6369513094d683bc_2_690x388.jpeg, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2a16ac52001cfbe85c26b66b6369513094d683bc_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2a16ac52001cfbe85c26b66b6369513094d683bc_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/2/2a16ac52001cfbe85c26b66b6369513094d683bc_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">3840×2160 2.51 MB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>At the top of the page we can see the partially obscured text “Quantum Reciprocal Lo”, which has been established to be referring to <strong>Quantum Reciprocal Logic</strong>.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s an ultra-low power superconducting digital technology that uses Josephson junctions instead of transistors. It’s based on the idea of encoding information in the presence or absence of a magnetic flux quantum, known as the Single Flux Quantum (SFQ). SFQ pulses are generated across the Josephson junctions. RQL uses reciprocal pairs of SFQ pulses to encode bits. Note that these are classical bits, not quantum bits, or qubits. With this technology you can build superconducting digital logic chips that have ultra-low power dissipation and can operate with clock speeds of tens or hundreds of GHz.</p>
<p>A Josephson junction and how it works is complicated to explain (look up the Josephson effect), but it’s basically two layers of superconducting material with a thin layer of non-superconducting material sandwiched in between, which acts as a non-superconducting barrier. Due to the quantum tunnelling effect, electrons will tunnel through the non-superconductive barrier without resistance, but only as long as the current through the junction is below a certain threshold, the critical current. If the current exceeds the critical current, an AC voltage will develop over the junction, which can be measured.</p>
<p>The superconducting material is usually Niobium, and the non-superconducting material is some kind of Aluminium Oxide. The Niobium needs to be liquid Helium-cooled for it to become superconducting.</p>
<p>The circuit schematic seen in the photo appears to be an example of an RQL shift register. The full circuit can be seen in this paper:</p>

<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4269" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ultra-Low-Power Superconductor Logic</a></h3>

<p>We have developed a new superconducting digital technology, Reciprocal
Quantum Logic, that uses AC power carried on a transmission line, which also
serves as a clock. Using simple experiments we have demonstrated zero static
power dissipation,...</p>


  </article>
  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>The key thing I note here is that this technology operates on conventional digital bits, and not quantum bits (qubits) (unless I’m missing something), but it can certainly form the basis for building a really fast supercomputer. Imagine what you can do if you can replace the liquid He-cooled Niobium superconductor with a room temperature superconductor.</p>
<p>So, this is likely the technology from which HALOS was built, and we can see how the Niobium fits into this. But there’s probably more to this, and HALOS definitely evolved beyond its original design, and the question is how and why.</p>
<p>There are many more questions, but those are for another post <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: It’s possible that RQL is being used in the support circuitry that controls the operation of the qubits in a quantum processor, sends information in the form of classical bits to the qubits, and reads out the information from the qubits. Qubits are also made up of circuits that uses Josephson junctions, so using RQL in the control circuitry should in theory be ideal as it can all be “easily” integrated on the same chip. This means that the processors that make up HALOS can still be quantum processors (QPUs).</p>

            <p>Perhaps the Xen crystal in that mysterious device is damaged and the reason Horn’s portal is broken now and he’s counting on the puzzle solver to bring a crystal from Xen to him since all of the Xen team members are dead and/or missing because they have already been absorbed by him into HALOS.</p>
<p>EDIT: Looks like I’m becoming obsessed with the idea of there being another reason for Dr. Horn using his test subjects and deciding it’s for us to bring something from Xen for him. It does make sense though if his portal used to work but doesn’t now.</p>
<p>2nd EDIT: Today starrifyx Discord post said:<br>
<em>“I better go back to the lab as well, before Dr Horn comes back &gt;_&gt;”</em></p>
<p>I responded with <em>“Gotta go back and work on fixing those Gates before Horn gets angry”</em></p>
<p>Storm replied with <img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/0/01d97e3cd853815dface6eb9f40a9b61be3e33e8.jpeg" alt="blobsipglare" data-base62-sha1="gmsapIc7aVpYh4TQb5Kj4RqIac" width="62" height="62"><br>
(Sip Glare Blob)<br>
Sounds like I hit a hot button.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: What else would he be commanding his prisoners to be working on in ‘the lab’ if it’s not repairing his broken portal?</p>

            <p>We know that quantum mechanics is central in this mystery, and both Schrödinger (likely the Schrödinger equation) and wave particle duality have been hinted at. And then we have the Myons/muons, which also seem to be hinting at some kind of duality—characters vs. particles (or avatars vs. particles.)</p>
<p>There is little doubt that HALOS is an AI, and it is likely running on some kind of quantum computer system. But it is not just an AI. There is something else going on. Clues about what that might be is likely to be found on the whiteboards in Xen. There are references to lenses, exotic matter, linear and circular polarization of light waves (multiplexing), evanescent waves, lasers and some kind of projection system connected to HALOS. Some kind of hologram technology has been suggested, but its exact nature, capabilities and purpose isn’t clear.</p>
<p>Recently, a photo of Storm’s notebook was “leaked”. In the photo, we can see a schematic/diagram of the D03/D04 labs, and more interestingly, the mysterious classified X01/X02 labs.</p>

<p>On the left page, there are notes/descriptions for the D03/D04 labs. Some of the text is difficult to make out, but this is what it looks like it says:</p>

<p>Here are some observations regarding what can be seen in each of the X01/X02 labs. The components and layout of both labs appear to be identical, apart from being mirrored:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decon chamber.</li>
<li>Some kind of control console.</li>
<li>A red laser beam going <em>into</em> the room via a conduit. It looks like it may be the same conduit seen in the other labs. Director panels direct the beam from the conduit into the room.<br>

            <p>Just as a small note. Us physicists love our Greek letters. In particular, Ψ and Φ are often used to label <em>wave functions</em> in quantum mechanics. So while Ψ is very prominent in psychology, I think it may be too much of a stretch to think the intention here is to point to psychology instead of physics.</p>

            <p>More ramblings…<br>
Dr Horn has two personalities. One writes in black on the whiteboards and the insane one writes in red.<br>

On this board the red personality shows his insanity while the black sane note says <em>Remember to wipe board before departure.</em></p>
<p>The insane one created this:<br>

The insane Dr Horn is obsessed with pizzas. Why? Because of the ability enhancements that Pizzas can give GW2 characters as well as the influence of Myon character Yufi Myon who is obsessed with Marmite. Yufi obsesses over Marmite, Horn obsesses over Pizza.</p>

<p><strong>STORM’S MUONS vs MYONS CREATIVE NOTES</strong> : <a href="https://gankersquad.proboards.com/thread/127/meet-myons">https://gankersquad.proboards.com/thread/127/meet-myons</a></p>
<p><em>Aira Myon - Aira was my first Asura character the story that goes behind it, is that the Myons originally wanted to have a name that represented the very pinnacle of particle physics, so chose Muon, but unfortunately at the name registration office, Pappy mispelled Muon to Myon, and it kind of stuck Aira is my Main and I’ve spent over 3200hrs on her</em></p>
<p>The clues indicate that Dr Horn was/is obsessed with Myons and GW2. His interaction with his HALOS technology greatly distorted this obsession and brought it to life in his own mind. He is convinced that Myons exist, pizza gives ability enhancements and that he can build an Asura gate to travel to other dimensions including to Metrica Province, the primary territory of the Asura. The insane Dr Horn’s motivations are to get there and live with his own kind.</p>
<p>This particular personality is insane!</p>
<p>If we assume that whiteboard notes in red are from the insane Dr Horn then we must assume that the note to contact JD Marcel is also one written by a madman and that Marcel is also a figment of his imagination.</p>
<p>One thing we’re still left to wonder is Where is Dr. Horn now?<br>
Somewhere on Xen?<br>
Somewhere around Black Mesa?<br>
Somewhere in GW2?<br>
Inside of HALOS?</p>
<p>His most recent Discord discussion of 10/30/2019 gives references to not being on earth or possibly even in our dimension. These statements include:</p>
<p><strong>EDITED DISCORD COMMENTS:</strong><br>
you think in such 3rd dimensional terms<br>
the US cannot touch me now<br>
who needs sleep now<br>
sleep is an earthly function<br>
and we are not on earthly business</p>
<p>and now i must go</p>
<p>im sure it will become clear soon<br>
until then i shall be in the other place<br>

Hey, why is Dr. Horn giving Dr. Yiu and Dr. Hubi orders?</p>
<p><strong>FlavransToday at 12:16 PM</strong><br>
Is he holding them captive, making them work for him?</p>
<p><strong>[LD] StormseekerToday at 12:23 PM</strong><br>
well not them per se</p>
<p>These comments may be implying that he is inside of, and maybe controlling, HALOS along with the other involuntary cohorts that he has integrated into it. ENLARGE AND LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS IMAGE:<br>

<p>The Xen whiteboards have 6 circled red letters on them. They are L-O-C-U-T-S which is only missing the letter ‘U’ from spelling “Locutus”, which is one of the circled names on Dr. Horn’s “conspiracy” whiteboard. It is shown as the link between the “Sphere of Chon” and the 21 into 1 figure.</p>
<p>This missing letter (U) was intentional and indicates that Storm is telling us that the only thing missing from HALOS being complete is ‘YOU’. His ‘reward’ that’s being offered to the first person to solve this mystery will end up being their involuntary incorporation into HALOS.</p>
<p>Edit: Dr Horn’s Asura gate is inactive. Probably, he believes, it’s because the power source used in GW2 was from a dragon and Horn has no access to that particular type of power. Maybe, he’s expecting the last solver of the puzzle, that will be integrated into HALOS, will also bring an exotic material from Xen that will power his Asura portal!  Just another of his insane expectations!</p>

<p>It wasn’t necessary for us to determine that at that time. Now that we are at the end, it is necessary that we understand it and that right now HALOS only has 20 of its necessary 21 cores.</p>

</aside>
<p>It doesn’t matter. HALOS isn’t specifically looking for developers, HALOS is simply seeking the brightest and Dr. Yiu was someone who was available to HALOS that fit its criteria. Dr Yiu wasn’t affiliated with the game at all and yet is included in the story just like Bottomley wasn’t affiliated with the game at all and yet is included in the story.</p>

<p>We had been given clues about what was going on before Xen was released. We had the BUGS references, the specific episode that referenced CyberAx (A Cage for Satan), knowledge that HALOS was an AI and existed in BM and that GLADOS, also in the HL universe, had multiple personality cores and Chris Horn’s statement that Dr Horn was insane. Storm could have picked any number, he just used 21 in order to include a lot of his cohorts in his assimilation storyline and leave one slot for the solver.</p>

<p>BUGS is also referenced along with Storm’s reference to “A Cage for Satan” which is the title of one of only two BUGS’ episodes that’s about CyberAx.</p>
<p>The episode specifically talks about CyberAx being a machine that takes over some of the user’s mind. Once users have finished using the Cyberax headset, it leaves a little bit of itself behind. It becomes a virus in their mind. This coincides with Chris Horn referring to Dr Horn as being insane in one of his developer interviews. HALOS is either Black Mesa’s version of multiple personality core GLADOS or of CyberAx. GLADOS integrates you into its neural net whereas CyberAx integrates itself into you. One makes you a part of its neural network and the other doesn’t.</p>
<p>LOCUTUS is a reference to Star Trek TNG, where Locutus of Borg was the Borg designation forced upon Starfleet Captain Jean-Luc Picard after he was assimilated by the Borg and he exhibited a totally different personality.</p>
<p>Notice that LOCUTUS is misspelled as LOCUTS. That missing letter was intentional. The only missing letter is ‘U’ which I believe means that Storm is telling us that the only thing missing from HALOS being complete is ‘YOU’.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>Following is my take on interpreting the meaning behind Tempus omnia relevant.</strong><br>
(EDITED two days after my original forum post to include a new thought.)</p>
<p><em>"It has come to my attention that strange messages have been appearing throughout Black Mesa, and have been causing somewhat of a conundrum concerning what has become known as “The Pizza Code Mystery”.</em></p>
<p><em>I have long suspected that there was something strange going on during the development of this facility. The unexplained disappearances, misappropriation of funds regarding cheesy oven-baked bread products and an ominous feeling that something is constantly watching this all from the shadows, have added up to create something that needs solving, and solving fast. As a result, I am offering a small reward to the first person that can solve this mystery and provide me with the answers I need. Together, I’m sure you can crack this."</em></p>
<p>The first thing I want to point out is the origins of the beginning of this message. It didn’t necessarily come from HALOS or Stormseeker or Dr Horn or any other character in the game. The comment was intercepted by HALOS (INTERCEPT 099.00//a ) to add additional information. The beginning originated from <a href="https://terminal.blackmesasource.com">https://terminal.blackmesasource.com</a> the same URL that the developers created for the game itself. Given that, we can assume that this was actually a message from one of the game developers. Now, let’s look at the message with that in mind.</p>
<p><em>“I have long suspected that there was something strange going on during the development of this facility.”</em></p>
<p>When was Black Mesa Developed?<br>
In the HL Universe - 1950’s<br>
By Valve - 1997<br>
By Crowbar Collective - 2004</p>
<p>Crowbar Collective is obviously the one responsible for the development of “<strong>this</strong> facility” and during that time it was being watched over, in real time, by the lead developer Carlos Montero. However, he can’t be considered to be ‘in the shadows’ since all the people working on the game knew about him.</p>
<p><strong>Who is it that the developers feel is constantly watching them from the shadows?</strong></p>
<p>(In game reference to ‘Seek code out. He is watching. He is AI’) Interpreted as: Seek 0418_08151814 out. HALOS is watching.</p>
<p>Obviously, within the game itself it is HALOS that is watching.</p>
<p>But, perhaps the incentive for mentioning something that is constantly watching from the shadows is  that the one real life entity that actually was watching during the development of the facility, and continues to be watching ‘from the shadows’, is Valve!</p>
<p>Valve’s managing director Gabe Newell is quoted as saying that a complete remake of Half-Life by fans of the game using Source was “not only possible…but inevitable” When the developers formed a new 13-person team titled <strong>Black Mesa: Source</strong> . The “Source” in the project’s title was later dropped when Valve asked the team to remove it in order to “stem confusion over whether or not it was an endorsed or official product”, which it at the time it was not. Valve was watching them from the shadows . In November 2013, the team confirmed they had been given the go-ahead from Valve to release a commercial version of the Black Mesa product via Steam. Valve published a news update about the modification on their Steam digital distribution platform in 2007 saying that “We’re as eager to play [Black Mesa] here as everyone else.”</p>
<p><strong>Valve has been watching over Black Mesa, from the shadows, for a long time and it began ‘during the development of this facility’. They continue to watch.</strong></p>
<p>There have been a number of inside jokes within the game itself. This is just one more of them.</p>
<p>OBSESSED WITH TIME TEAM. Inside joke about Johnathan Welsh,<br>
PBR - PARALAX CUBES- GEEF Inside joke about Chetan’s programming skills,<br>
WHY ARE THERE BOATS EVERYWHERE? Inside joke about hiding out of place things like boats in maps.<br>
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? Names of ARG forum participants and finally an ominous feeling that something is constantly watching this all from the shadows would also be an inside joke about Valve. This seems to coincide with the additional statement “It is one thing to communicate with something mysterious but, it is quite another to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether it understands the same concept of reason that we do.”</p>
<p>The additional Latin statement <strong>Vox populi vox Dei</strong> (“the voice of the people is the voice of God.”) may also be a reference to Valve. Valve is the God of Half Life and would be viewed by the developers as their God in the development acceptance and approval of their work.</p>
<p><strong>What are the unexplained disappearances?</strong></p>
<p>Missing scientists from the game who were being used as test subjects for inclusion into the CyberAx AI project. It could also be another inside joke reference to original members of the Black Mesa development team who left.</p>
<p><strong>What is the motivation for offering a reward to the first person that can solve this mystery?</strong></p>
<p>It’s not necessarily a message from Dr Horn, it was a message from someone within the Black Mesa Source developers and I don’t believe that this “reward” is anything you should seek.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because we are nothing more than just “test subjects”.</p>
<p><strong>Why is HALOS testing us? What’s the purpose?</strong></p>
<p>The message specifically talks about ‘the first person that can solve this mystery’. It doesn’t use the word ‘you’ because that can be plural. Its purpose is only to see who ‘the first person’ is to resolve the problem. This ONE individual would have passed all of the tests and proven themselves worthy.</p>
<p>This one worthy individual will become the final, perhaps the 21st, component of the AI project……</p>
<p>….whether they want to or not.</p>
