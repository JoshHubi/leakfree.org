<p>Actually there has been at least one remake that I’m aware off which was being made on the Source engine. However the team were contacted by 3D Realms and had to shut down. :meh:</p>

<p>There’s screens available but I can’t find them at the moment.</p>

</aside>
<p>If someone were to resurrect that project, I can’t see 3D Realms try to shut them down again, what with them being defunct and all. (Still, sad to see them go.)  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>At least this is something to look forward to, along with all the other good games  and mods coming out this year.</p>

            <p>Whenever I play Quake, Quake 2, Doom, Doom2, Duke3D, whatever, I always use the original game. I really hate the “high poly” models, cause they look really cheesy and out of place in the low res environments. Plus it doesn’t feel the same, more like a cheap knock off or a mod.</p>

<p>I find it amazing that Duke Nukem shares the same engine as WOLF3D. True, it is a slightly newer version, but even Duke3D isn’t true 3D.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Right. But Ken Silverman rebuilt the engine using OpenGL, which later evolved into JonoF’s port of Duke3d.</p>
<p>I don’t mind that sort of improvement to the game, because it’s nothing more than correcting technical flaws in the engine, rather than messing around with the artistic style of the game as the new 3d models do. In the original Duke3D, the perspective looked really messed up whenever you looked up or down. The problem (and this was the case with the Doom engine as well when it came to games like Heretic) was that vertical lines were always rendered parallel, which only makes sense if the camera is always horizontal.</p>
<p>The OpenGL ports of these games are awesome, giving you proper perspective correct rendering with full 180 degree vertical mouse look, and bilinear filtering so you don’t get that blocky effect on the textures. But nothing else about the games is changed.</p>

            <p>You aren’t thinking of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken's_Labyrinth" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Ken’s Labyrinth</a>? Ken Silverman, who wrote the BUILD engine for DN3D, made that. As far as I know it doesn’t have anything to do with Wolfenstein 3D even though the similarities are almost uncanny. The BUILD engine was written entirely by Ken himself from the ground up, at least that’s what I’ve been told.</p>

<p>They’ll still co-create and sell games, they just dropped the DNF team. So they’re still there just not as badass.</p>

<p>That’s what they all do, but sometimes we all want to do something with the game, don’t we? That’s why this was born. Exactly the same reason for the High Resolution Pack. People didn’t just want to see the old 8-bit graphics in higher resolutions, they wanted to see integrated 3d models, hi-res textures, new music and sounds. Hell, there were even a few guys that went further and made a modification for the HRP which added even more special effects and extreme gore.</p>

<p>I seriously don’t see any problem with it, if that’s what they want to do why shouldn’t they? If they can do it and want to do it they should go for it.</p>

<p>I find it amazing that Duke Nukem shares the same engine as WOLF3D. True, it is a slightly newer version, but even Duke3D isn’t true 3D.</p>

</aside>
<p>If they have love for the game they can play with the original graphics. Don’t get me wrong… Duke Nukem 3D was fun… but very overrated.</p>
<p>I have love for Half-Life, but I haven’t played Half-Life: Source, but I will play Black Mesa.</p>
<p>It seems confusing and contradictory but it really isn’t.</p>
<p>Graphics are secondary to gameplay by a long shot, and I wouldn’t play the same game again purely to play it with new graphics, I would play it again because I wanted to play the game. Now don’t get me wrong, this all looks pretty and everything… but it’s the same, unaltered gameplay and the same, very basic level geometry. They’re only improving the look.</p>
<p>I may try it… but not for the sake of the graphics, only if I feel like playing Duke Nukem 3D.</p>

<p>Irony aside, there’s a big distinction between new graphics and a full remake from the ground up like Black Mesa.</p>

<p>Love for the game maybe? Check <a href="http://Duke4.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Duke4.net</a> and the 3D Realms forums and you’ll see that a lot of people look forward to it.</p>
<p>Funny thing is that the news about this Polymer rendering was posted on the 3D Realms forums at the first of April so everyone thought it just was some kind of April Fool’s joke. Well, it turned out it wasn’t.</p>

<p>8-bit mode is most likely to be supported so you can play with the old graphics but with the new effects.<br>
And as previously mentioned you can’t remake this game on a completely different engine unless you want a legal case all up your ass.</p>
