            <p>damn, good point… it moves, but it’s on an axis, i can get it to rotate by pressing a prop agianst it, but (no matter how many) grenades do nothing,<br>
what is suppose to happen? If it opens up a new are maybe I could just “noclip” to it <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

            <p>Blast it out of there with a grenade or whatever. Try everything. So it’s not moving at all and it’s not allowing you to pick it up? Sounds really weird… I say reload a save waaaay back and try again. Even if you could spawn a valve there’s no guarantee that it would ‘fit’ the thing it’s supposed to go on. There couldn’t specifics as to what valve goes where. In another area where there are 2 valves that need replacing 1 only goes on 1 and 1 only goes on the other… which gives the idea that each valve has an intended joiner.</p>

<p>Ah okay. I know the one completely.</p>
<p>Did you turn the other one already? It looks like you did because the steam is coming out of the vents. Or was that from pressing the button? I’m not sure. I think you’re not meant to press the button or something. I can’t remember what I did but I spent quite a bit of time around there trying to get past that area.</p>
<p>I smashed all the boxes, and stuff. I think I turned the first valve, that is already connected. Then pressed the button, then connected the second and turned that.</p>
<p>I’m not sure. If it wasn’t that, then I turned the first valve. Connected the second and then turned it. But I know I didn’t try and connect the valve before I BEFORE I pressed the button or turned the one that is already there.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure there is a ‘trigger’ that enables you to even pick that valve up. So like you can’t pick it up before you’ve done something. If it’s stuck somehow, try moving or bumping or shooting or even sticking a grenade in there to blow it up, so it moves and see if you can pick it up from a different location.</p>

<p>I always picked up the valve before doing anything…works fine, then i turn both valves and press the button.</p>

            <p>Hmm… I dunno where that is. Can you pull up your saves and see what level you are on? Just hit ESC, then ‘Load Save’ and give me the name of the latest ‘auto-save’.</p>
<p>I’ve played the game through twice now. But it’s hard to remember the level names.</p>

            <p>I don’t understand. You’re saying that after messing up the valve in 1 save, when reloading another it’s gone? I don’t understand how that is possible. Close the game and do a reboot.</p>

            <p>I think they set the valve as part of the environment, not a prop, as when I place the cross-air on it and press “E” it makes the noise a switch makes that doesn’t do anything, instead of the one that a prop that is to heavy to pick up makes,</p>
