    <title>Computer not starting</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-not-starting/12752</link>
    <description>Last night I unplugged my computer (a dell Inspiron 620s) and left it unplugged overnight.

Today, I plugged it back in and it&#39;s not starting up again. The power supply light on the back is on, and there&#39;s a glowing orange light inside the case for some reason, but the power button light in front is off, and nothing happens when I press it.

I have no idea what the issue is, but googling it suggests the PSU might have failed, even though there&#39;s no apparent reason for it to have done so.

Does anyone have any idea what the issue might be?</description>

<p>I might try that if I can find a pair of rubber gloves, thanks.</p>
<p>However, I’ve been looking it up, and apparently the issue might be that my PSU is insufficient for the GPU I bought some time ago. This, combined with leaving it unplugged for awhile, could that cause nasty issues?</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, it is recommended to run your PC at about 60 to 80% power usage, it will run at 100% power usage but the PSU can’t really handle it long term.</p>
<p>Your GPU is pretty beefy right? Maybe your PC does have a standard ATX port in which case I definitely recommend a new power supply with at least 2 12v rails and 500W total output.</p>

            <p>Alright, I tried touching a screwdriver and a paper clip to the prong on the power button thing; no response at all.</p>

            <p>never test DELL power supplies, you might catch your house on fire</p>
<p>dell always fucks around with the placement of the pins on the ATX power supplies</p>
<p>just try the button, unplug the buttons from the motherboard and try to turn it on with the paperclip</p>

            <p>I’m not sure I want to cut the wires. It seems a bit drastic. Plus there are about six of them leading from the button, and I’ve never played with electrical equipment in my life.</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently you can short the pins with a paperclip somehow?</p>
<p>Edit: I tried to test the PSU with this paper clip thing but I couldn’t get the fucking ATX connector free.</p>

            <p>cut the wires leading to the power button and short them to simulate a button press</p>
<p>if it starts, you need a new powerbutton, otherwise you need a new PSU</p>
<p>make sure to disconnect the wires to “let go of the button” otherwise your PC is just gonna reboot continuously</p>

            <p>That’s funny.</p>
<p>After doing some more research, it seems that the issue might be with the power button itself. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
