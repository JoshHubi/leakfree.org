<p>You spend all your time trying to convince of us this stuff, then suddenly start talking about OOBEs and LSD trips. It seems like you were using that as some sort of argument.</p>
<p>I will confess I stretched it a little, but that was just because I enjoy drawing out poor logic like that.</p>

<h2>a lot would need to be posted to explain all the details regarding these images, but some (especially fellow Washingtonians) might be able to piece some of it</h2>
<p>this all spurred from an interesting first-hand account my cousin enthusiastically shared with me 2 years ago, April, 2008. when he stumbled upon one of these sites in the woods with some friends during a midnight trek, and an epic chase that ensued all the way from the dark woods to the neighboring town, pursued by <span class="bbcode-b">MP</span>s and local cops. I only just <span class="bbcode-i">now</span> decided to start this “investigation” with the hints he gave me.<br>
the “site” in the Spanaway woods they stumbled upon… happens to connect to the woods around <span class="bbcode-b">Fort Lewis</span>.</p>
<p>extra, extra: Given the nature of things, I’m suspicious that my cold, but <span class="bbcode-u">genius</span> airforce intelligence trainee older cousin (the previously mentioned’s older brother) is being groomed to be a government blackop overseer, for the Airforce. details, details…</p>

            <p>Yeah, I watched a few of his videos and they were all crap. There was one picture of some sand and some rocks that didn’t look like mars at all, and a piece of metal or something that looked 'shopped on.</p>

<p>Yeah, and I saw a documentary on national geographic channel where they showed how they were just different hieroglyphs grafted over eachother over time.</p>
<p>Those big lamp-like things might actually be lamps though. Batteries and lamps are fairly simple technology in essence.<br>
I remember seeing something about pots being found with remains of two different substances in it that react like a battery would.<br>
And a lamp is just a wire in a bit of glass, isn’t it.</p>

            <p>I know, that guy has definitely got a hard-on for the first sign of evidence, but I’m just trying to see it from his perspective.</p>
<p>As for first vid, these images and ideas get repeated and recycled over and over throughout history, across the world. the vid is just a taste.</p>
<p>ooh, lookit that thang:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d67gfdM7VeI" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d67gfdM7VeI</a><br>
clear footage these days. more and more reactionary skeptics (huhu after effects). i think people will only believe when it’s blurry, sporadic footage, but when it’s in your face, you look for as many ways to debunk it as you might to validate it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmAgGNjeQ0&amp;feature=related" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsmAgGNjeQ0&amp;feature=related</a><br>
flying mentos?</p>
<p>edit: I keep reading from some pockets of people that most of NASA’s recent ufo images are faked. Not sure of full reason as to why (aside from obvious reasons).<br>
hmm. I bet the “green man” photo was a media red herring, if we wanna get all conspiracy’d out. That was quite sensationalized, i remember. They never sensationalize anything else of that nature.</p>

            <p>Oh c’mon… Those two videos just show people seeing things in everything.</p>
<p>The only thing in those 2 videos that is rather funny/interesting, is the Egyptian hieroglyphs that kinda look like a helicopter and an airplane (the 2 other things he marked just look like… well nothing. The rest is just… buh.</p>
<p>Yes, ancient statues represent a modern SWAT team because they have helmets and armor and a hand weapon. Those 3 things sure are modern technology. Not like Neanderthals used heandweapons or anything. And knights in the dark ages were going to battle wearing nothing but a loincloth.</p>
<p>That graveyard and those “remains” in the second video are clearly rocks. Granted, the presumed graveyard looks interesting because it’s alone in the middle of nowhere, but it just looks like a plain old rock to me.</p>

            <p>Interesting theories on the “ghosts of mars,” I’ve been skimming. Hostile, warlike beings that had some influence on greater ancient civilizations on earth, alongside the more beneficial/intellectual sounding visitors.<br>
also just watched the 9th <span class="bbcode-b">X-Files</span> episode “Space,” seemingly about the same stuff…<br>
I bet there exists a theory that these same spectral beings are also responsible for the manipulation of the U.S. shadow government and the Space program <span class="bbcode-i">today</span>, if that’s where the show is going (still watching first season). I read somewhere that Obama was meant to brief the public about hostile beings in addition to peaceful ones.</p>
<p>here’s a couple cool, short clips to give a gander:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymf4-Knawys&amp;feature=related" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymf4-Knawys&amp;feature=related</a></p>

<p>nifty. those giant "skeletons, <span class="bbcode-i">if</span> not totally bogus, resemble an old account from my personal X-files tome: sighting of a 10-15 foot tall being in Flatwoods, west Virginia 1952.<br>
large roundy head, big eyes, and hovered towards a crowd of townsfolk, which included a group of kids, a woman with her two sons, and a national guardsmen, who gathered to watch a ufo land on a cleared hill in the woods. can’t find the picture that’s in this book i got though: a woman holding her painting of it with a man beside it, for reference.<br>
The account is creepy as hell.</p>

<p>Why are you presupposing unknown “technology” to explain something that modern science already accounts for (for the most part)? The interesting question is why these “hallucinations” are so often of the same thing, or interpreted as the same thing by different people. The fact that people most often interpret plasma hallucinations as either alien entities or under intelligent control by alien entities certainly begs a many interesting questions, and we can’t rule out the possibility that the phenomenon may in fact be some sort of attempt at contact and communication.</p>

</aside>
<p>Maybe perceived intelligence could possible be the result of non-intelligent patterns in said plasma?</p>

<p>also, <span class="bbcode-b">out-of-body experiences</span>, a<span class="bbcode-b">nd remote viewing</span>. anybody familiar, or have experiences? I sure have, when I was a kid.</p>
<p>I remember one Christmas eve, I had one that was so <span class="bbcode-i">by-the-book</span> it was ridiculous. Mind you, this was a little before I started reading about abduction cases.</p>
<p>I woke up around 3 in the morning, flat on my back on the bed… staring up, and felt tired, but awake. then, my body seemed to float upwards to the low ceiling, and into the spinning ceiling fan. i don’t remember anything after that. but was distracted come the next morning anyways. (Christmas, woo!)</p>
<hr>
<p>a few weeks ago, i was trying to go to sleep, so i tried to relax and clear my thoughts. next thing i knew, i was almost sure i was glimpsing into my friend’s dorm down the hall as he was talking to his girlfriend, whom i was aware was visiting him. it was so freaky and vivid that i shook myself out of it.<br>
[COLOR=‘Gray’][Note: I had then recently been recovering from the influence of a strong, non-consensual dose of LSD, and manipulation by a ‘friend’]</p>
<p>The days immediately after that, i was the most content I’ve ever been in my life (zen, enlightenment, whatever), highly conscious of people and my surroundings. but this was soon quelled by the prescription of anti-psychotics, as i hid my LSD exposure, and was briefly (<span class="bbcode-i">Grossly</span>) misdiagnosed with schizophrenia.  :s hrug:</p>
<hr>
<p>i can’t really smoke weed anymore, because when I do, i temporarily turn into a huge, emotionally manipulative asshole/timebomb. &lt;-- Interestingly, such dabbling in hallucinogens was the inspiration for <span class="bbcode-i">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</span>, as well as <span class="bbcode-i">One flew over the Cuckoo’s nest</span>.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>hallucinations, based on genetic memory account for some mass trips, and similar sightings around the world (often pertaining to cultural/historical relevancy, if you follow human psychology). largley witnessed, recorded weeping <span class="bbcode-b">statues</span> of maddonna in the west, and japanese maidens in the east (prior to Hiroshima bombing) are just one example. there’s all sorts of interesting theories regarding it.<br>
[COLOR=‘Gray’]Also i think might be worth mentioning are historical patterns and the steady increase in novelty, as I’m sure you, mattemuse, are familiar. the power of 10x</p>
<p>another concept that I’m reminded of,  [pertaining the appearance of travel] are cases of shamans spawning beings, some that can duplicate themselves into multiple sentiences (depending on the power of the projector/monk), throughout history. I believe this is also related to PK, or poltergeist phenomenon. Quantum mechanics at work?</p>
<p>I believe it was the inspiration for this classic episode of X-files, and many others:</p>

<p>Also, <span class="bbcode-u">[COLOR=‘Wheat’]The Men who stare at Goats</span>, is worth reading, if just for curiosity. Definitely topical.</p>

<p>That’s what that photo was, in the link I posted. An ET using that technology to travel, without an actual vehicle.</p>
<p>I also remember (from the disclosure project site) something about zero-point energy being used to power their technology, but according to wikipedia (yeahyeah, unreliable) it’s not viable at all. But hey, if there actually <span class="bbcode-i">are</span> ETs, then what do we know.</p>
<p>And when they travel at what appears to be faster than light-speed, they’re actually moving from on point in space to another, <span class="bbcode-i">directly</span>, through time in a manner of speaking.</p>
<p>Something like that, anyway, cba to read up atm.</p>

<p>the concepts introduced in the second episode alone (“<span class="bbcode-b">Deep throat</span>”) are startlingly similar to the stuff I’ve been reading from these recent developments.

</aside>
<p>You expect Russia to publicly admit anything about a military weapons test? I wanted it to be legit because it looks damn cool, but I just don’t buy it.  Anyway, the aurora is a plasma phenomenon, and the British military considers legit UFO sightings to also be a plasma phenomenon. Sightings of “aliens” inside UFOs and other eyewitness accounts are explained by high-energy plasma’s mind-altering effects on human consciousness. I also read some recent independent research on “ball lightning” coming to the same conclusion - that the “ball” itself is actually a hallucination caused by high-energy plasma in lightning strikes.</p>
