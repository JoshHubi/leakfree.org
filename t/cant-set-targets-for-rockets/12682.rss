    <title>Can&#39;t set targets for rockets.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-set-targets-for-rockets/12682</link>
    <description>I&#39;m at the part where i ran for Big Blue.
Then climbed up the square thingy.

Now that i&#39;m ontop i can&#39;t manage to do /ANYTHING/ on the panel.
The red marker isn&#39;t appearing.
I rammed all my keys, LMB/RMB and it shot a lucky shot and killed Big Blue.
Now i read that i need to hit the electricity pole and two walls more aswell.

Now that i can&#39;t aim for at all, how am i going to proceed?
Could anyone give me a save file from the next part?
It&#39;s at the Central Complex.
Couldn&#39;t didn&#39;t gave me any.

Please help me.</description>

            <p>I just tried it.  You have to get pretty close to the screen and aim with your weapon.  A reticle should appear on the screen and line up with your crosshairs.  “Attack” the screen and it should place a red circle on the map.  Aim at the button at the bottom and “attack” again.  You should soon hear a whistling sound and if you look at the sky, you should see a streak coming from it.  That is the airstrike bombing the location you marked.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work for you, I have a save file where the gargantua and tower are destroyed, but try what I said first.</p>

            <p>Try getting close to the aiming map, aiming your gun on the area you want to shoot,  pressing the “use” key (whatever you use to hit buttons, pull levers, etc) then aiming your gun on the bug button at the bottom and pressing the “use” key again.</p>
<p>See if that works.  I’d test it myself but I’m having a “CFileSystem_Steam::Init() failed: failed to find steam interface” error that I’m currently unable to solve.</p>
