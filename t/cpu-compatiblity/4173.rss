    <description>Alright so I am helping a friend out with upgrading his processor.  But I want to make absolutly sure I am doing it right, so I am asking your help.

[url]https://support.gateway.com/s/MOTHERBD/Intel2/4006160R/4006160Rsp2.shtml[/url]
that is his motherboard
[url]https://support.gateway.com/s/pc/R/1009462/1009462nv.shtml[/url]
this is his PC in general

[url]https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=2010340343%201051707842&amp;name=LGA%20775[/url]
Now basically anything off of this page will work on his PC right? Or am I missing something?</description>

            <p>Ya, I know I’ve got a quad core.  Most games don’t really use all my cores they stick to one or two…</p>
<p>Edit: or in the case of source games I’m better off with multicore off and just letting use 1 core  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>the E8400 can break 4Ghz on a good board easily.</p>

            <p>He doesn’t really want to do that big of an upgrade.  He just wants to grab a new CPU to upgrade from his old core 2 duo x2 1.8 Ghz.</p>

<p>E8400 overclocks better than a Q9550. I have a Q9450 and it’s hard to keep it stable above 3.6 GHz without increasing the voltages to dangerous levels.</p>

</aside>
<p>Didnt compare any of the two but hey, thats why i was wondering he wouldnt wanna upgrade his mobo and have an i7, according to most overclockers 3.6 is a walk in the park and most achieve 3.3-3.6 on stock voltages, along with the added bonus of turbo mode.</p>

<p>Thought he wouldve gone for a newer mobo socket type like the 1366 and an i core, core 2 is not nessecarily dated but if he gets a new mobo with a newer socket type i think thatll help him he can then prepare himself for 6 core compatibility a bit later once there cheaper.</p>

<p>but with a 1366 socket type hes putting himself in a better spot. aswell as the added bonus of high ram.</p>

            <p>if i’m not mistaken none of those will boot because the mobo specs say p4 (or p4 celeron) and pentium D (or celeron D) only.</p>
<p>try to read through the bios upgrades maybe they added support for conroe cores but i doubt it</p>
