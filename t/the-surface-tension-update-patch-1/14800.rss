    <title>The Surface Tension Update - Patch 1</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-surface-tension-update-patch-1/14800</link>
    <description>[align=center][u][b]Surface Tension Update - Patch 1[/b][/u][/size][/align]
[u]Note:[/u] This update does not contain Xen. We are working on Xen! This is a small hotfix patch to resolve some of the issues with the Surface Tension Update.

[u][b]Programming[/b][/u][/size]
* CSM should now be functional and working correctly on AMD cards.
* French and Portugese translation/captions are added and fixed in the main menu.
* Fixed a bug where disabling CSM would cause it to set to “very low” when you next start the game.
* Potentially fixed the “CSM ghosting” bug where a weird overlay would appear on the screen if you enabled CSM.
* Fixed a bug where the godrays option would reset when the game is restarted.
* cl_autoweaponswitch cvar added to disable automatic weapon switching, if needed.


[u][b]Level Design[/b][/u][/size]

[b]C2A5G (Surface Tension Uncut)[/b]
* Fixed a bug where if you backpedal through the door that leads to the car park at the beginning of the map, it would close and could not be reopened again.
* Fixed invulnerable AGrunt at the helipad if the player tries to save the Osprey.
* Fixed alternate vent route Headcrabs from clipping with the player and being invisible if they the player jumps over the vent gap.
* Fixed various conditions that allowed the player to exit via the bomb trap room and get into the TOW courtyard that way.
* Add player clips to prevent exploitation of the map.


[b]C2A5H (Surface Tension Uncut)[/b]
* Fixed a bug where the hangar Guard choreography would get broken if you went to the hangar door exit before reaching the part of the level where you actually meet the Guard.
* Corrected hanger security door to use the correct sounds like the rest of the doors in the map.
* Player clipped the dumpster by the jump pad to prevent the player from getting stuck.
* Removed the fence behind the guard shack to prevent the player getting stuck.
* Ladders on the fire escape now work in case the player decides to use the jump pad to get on them.
* Fixed 50Cal getting tank projectiles stuck in it.
* Add player clips to prevent exploitation of the map.


[u][b]Multiplayer[/b][/u][/size]
* Fixed a bug where sv_ranked would crash servers on startup.
* Generated loading screens for dm_crossfire, dm_rail, dm_power and dm_chopper. All official maps should now have proper loading screens at all resolutions.
* Added some graphical detail to a few areas in dm_rail as well as a playerclipping pass to make projectiles get caught less on silly obstacles.
* Fixed c2a5h and c2a5i showing up on the multiplayer map list.


[u][b]Miscellaneous/Notes[/b][/u][/size]
* Several big community mods have been broken with the last update. If you see missing textures or any strange behaviour, those are likely the cause. On a Rail Uncut is also broken and will cause texture errors in a few places in the game, particularly On a Rail. The author is working on fixing these issues.</description>

</aside>
<p>I’ve done a file-by-file comparison (not subscribed to any workshop mods). The maps dm_chopper.bsp, dm_crossfire.bsp and dm_rail.bsp (and dm_rail.txt) are different.</p>
<p>I’ve also compared the server maps with the maps in the v0.3.0 update of the main game (from a backup), and they were all byte-for-byte identical, which means the dedicated server was never updated alongside the v0.3.1 patch of the main game.</p>

<p>I’m also having this issue! Whenever a server has dm_crossfire running it disconnects me with that message, it happens to my friend also. We both got the game recently, and I tried verifying the game cache. Did nothing.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>I know that my ability to hear things in-game is apparently not that great, but it’s such a mechanical and human-like sound that I was 100% sure some system in the <span class="bbcode-i">tank</span> was making it. (That, or the radio itself.)</p>
<p>I haven’t played HL2 frequently or recently so I don’t think ‘combine’ whenever I hear it, but I <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> think it’s way too mechanical of a sound for Xenian biotech.</p>
<p>(Also, there’s an <span class="bbcode-i">alarm</span> in it that I think clearly indicates it as being something made by humans.)</p>

<p>You’re right, I didn’t know about that attack. Still, hopefully that sound will be replaced in BM. For now, I think we’ve derailed enough from the actual purpose of this thread.</p>

            <p>The only thing I thought was odd about the beam attack was the fact the manta made a gunship sound at the end of it. If that final sound was not there would not have put two and two together to get continuity error, cause becides that could just be the sound that the source of energy makes on discharge.</p>
<p>EDIT: The way I see it xen tech and combine tech are two completely different things, especially sense in the canon (from wiki, books, and valves statements) the only bit of combine tech was on the final boss in half life. There should be no signs of the combine in half life as well the xen beings are running from the combine for the most par.t</p>

<p>Also, something else that bugged me just there, the Mantaray’s gun seems to re-use some sounds from HL2. Will this be changed in the future? It gives the ship a very combineish feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>At first I thought it was weird to hear that noise too, but I actually have a feeling that this is more of a small detail connecting the 2 games together, I mean who knows, what if the Manta rays are xen’s attempt of doing synths, maybe even with combine tech as the sound shows.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That sound instantly reminded me of HL2, it was <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">so non-BM</span></span>. It could be, it’s an interesting perspective, but still, that was a straight combine sound attached to something of Xenian origin, which just shouldn’t be there. If it’d be something similar, but not identical, will be better and more suitable for the ship imo, and still connect the 2 games.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was weird to hear that noise too, but I actually have a feeling that this is more of a small detail connecting the 2 games together, I mean who knows, what if the Manta rays are xen’s attempt of doing synths, maybe even with combine tech as the sound shows.</p>

<p>The developers are still working on this rare glitch. Here’s a recent post with some info and a devs response (from the steam forums)<br>

</aside>
<p>There was a patch quite a while ago which supposedly fixed that notorious issue (there were multiple attempts with this one in fact). Don’t recall seeing it reported again afterwards.</p>
<p>Talking about level design issues, as this patch contains some fixes regarding these, and I haven’t noticed this one being reported anywhere, so I don’t know if it was fixed: It is possible to clip through some rocks where the Mantaray scene is. (Mobile pic since I’m unable to do anything about this, can’t really run the game on this toaster…)</p>
<p>Also, something else that bugged me just there, the Mantaray’s gun seems to re-use some sounds from HL2. Will this be changed in the future? It gives the ship a very combineish feeling.<br>

<p>It makes me really sad that it’s become necessary for this to be put in all patch notes. It makes me even sadder that some people will probably still ask about Xen anyway.</p>
<p>Now that the one community-based grievance has been aired, looks like every bug I’ve reported or seen someone else report from the last update has been fixed quite quickly - keep up the good work, guys!</p>

<span class="bbcode-u">Note:</span> This update does not contain Xen. We are working on Xen! This is a small hotfix patch to resolve some of the issues with the Surface Tension Update.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Programming</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>CSM should now be functional and working correctly on AMD cards.</li>
<li>French and Portugese translation/captions are added and fixed in the main menu.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where disabling CSM would cause it to set to “very low” when you next start the game.</li>
<li>Potentially fixed the “CSM ghosting” bug where a weird overlay would appear on the screen if you enabled CSM.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the godrays option would reset when the game is restarted.</li>
<li>cl_autoweaponswitch cvar added to disable automatic weapon switching, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Level Design</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">C2A5G (Surface Tension Uncut)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where if you backpedal through the door that leads to the car park at the beginning of the map, it would close and could not be reopened again.</li>
<li>Fixed invulnerable AGrunt at the helipad if the player tries to save the Osprey.</li>
<li>Fixed alternate vent route Headcrabs from clipping with the player and being invisible if they the player jumps over the vent gap.</li>
<li>Fixed various conditions that allowed the player to exit via the bomb trap room and get into the TOW courtyard that way.</li>
<li>Add player clips to prevent exploitation of the map.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">C2A5H (Surface Tension Uncut)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the hangar Guard choreography would get broken if you went to the hangar door exit before reaching the part of the level where you actually meet the Guard.</li>
<li>Corrected hanger security door to use the correct sounds like the rest of the doors in the map.</li>
<li>Player clipped the dumpster by the jump pad to prevent the player from getting stuck.</li>
<li>Removed the fence behind the guard shack to prevent the player getting stuck.</li>
<li>Ladders on the fire escape now work in case the player decides to use the jump pad to get on them.</li>
<li>Fixed 50Cal getting tank projectiles stuck in it.</li>
<li>Add player clips to prevent exploitation of the map.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Multiplayer</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where sv_ranked would crash servers on startup.</li>
<li>Generated loading screens for dm_crossfire, dm_rail, dm_power and dm_chopper. All official maps should now have proper loading screens at all resolutions.</li>
<li>Added some graphical detail to a few areas in dm_rail as well as a playerclipping pass to make projectiles get caught less on silly obstacles.</li>
<li>Fixed c2a5h and c2a5i showing up on the multiplayer map list.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Miscellaneous/Notes</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>Several big community mods have been broken with the last update. If you see missing textures or any strange behaviour, those are likely the cause. On a Rail Uncut is also broken and will cause texture errors in a few places in the game, particularly On a Rail. The author is working on fixing these issues.</li>
</ul>
