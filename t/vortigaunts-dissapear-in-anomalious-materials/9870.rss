    <description>Hi everyone.

I was playing Black Mesa and I reached the part with the test chamber where you have to push the crystal in that thing. The experiment goes wrong and then you are teleported to Xen for a few seconds. Four vortigaunts show up, but after a few seconds, the last one from the right suddenly disappears.

I didn&#39;t managed to do a screen, unfortunately  :frowning:</description>
