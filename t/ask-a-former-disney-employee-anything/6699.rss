    <title>Ask a Former Disney Employee Anything</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ask-a-former-disney-employee-anything/6699</link>
    <description>I interned at a Disney property for six months last year, and have since found that most people are very curious about what it was like. Any rumors about Disney you want to confirm? Want any behind the scenes info? Anything you&#39;re interested in, I&#39;ll do my best to answer.</description>

<p>Is there a Cruella De Vil Costume? (in all the videos and Pictures I’ve seen of inside Walt Disney World, I’ve never seen Cruella)<br>
Is there really a Pizza Planet Restaurant on the park premises? (I think I saw it on one of the Travel channel programs)<br>
Does Cinderella’s Castle actually have an interior (apart from the main entrance) or is much of what we see in the photos a shell?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is! She doesn’t come out often. Your best bet would be at Hollywood Studios. There are thousands of costumes, and each park only has about thirty at any given time. They rotate two or three of them every month or so.</p>
<p>There is a Pizza Planet, but it’s not a Pizza Planet like it should be. It’s a counter service pizza and fast food restaurant at Hollywood Studios. There are no big cool robots guarding the entrance, and the arcade is just okay. The pizza’s pretty good, though. Still worth a look.</p>
<p>The castle is indeed a shell… <span class="bbcode-i">mostly</span>. At the base of the castle, (the part that you walk through), there are massive mosaics showing different parts of the story. At this level, there is also an entrance and reservation area for the “Cinderella’s Royal Table” restaurant. From there, you take an elevator up to about the middle of the structure. That’s the restaurant proper. It books up far in advance, but you get an amazing view of the fireworks.</p>
<p>And then there’s the Royal Suite. It is a magical place that you will never ever see unless you are an exceptionally adorable child or produce and walk around with an exceptionally adorable child. If you meet either of these criteria, a cast member may select you (out of the million or so people at any of the four parks), to stay there for the night. It’s in one of the turrets, I think. If you get this, you get waited on hand and foot, and can skip any line in the park.</p>

<p>I think you mean “more vague”. Unfortunately, it’s a question I’m not allowed to answer. But if I was, I’d say no. They were pretty cool. They even gave me gloves for that one time they had me dump industrial runoff into a protected lake.</p>
<p>Sorry I haven’t been keeping up with this. The hard drive of my laptop got fried yesterday. I’m on a <em>shudder</em> library computer right now in between classes. Updates may be slow until I get this all sorted out. So fucking pissed.</p>

            <p>Is there a Cruella De Vil Costume? (in all the videos and Pictures I’ve seen of inside Walt Disney World, I’ve never seen Cruella)<br>
Is there really a Pizza Planet Restaurant on the park premises? (I think I saw it on one of the Travel channel programs)<br>
Does Cinderella’s Castle actually have an interior (apart from the main entrance) or is much of what we see in the photos a shell?</p>

<p>How often are people caught having sex in the park?</p>
<p>Is Disneyland Paris updated at the same time as the American parks in terms of new rides and attractions?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>VERY often. Especially on the omnimover rides like Haunted Mansion and spaceship Earth. As long as it’s not in front of everyone, though, my understanding is that they let it slide. I never got into any trouble, at least.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Disneyland Paris and the other parks are updated pretty much independently. They have stuff we don’t have, but we have stuff they’ll never get as well. Sometimes, they’ll trade stuff, though. Years back, we got the stunt car show from them, and now there’s rumors of trading night parades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would you say are the best benefits of being a Disney employee? The worst drawbacks?</p>
<p>Have you seen or heard about any major accidents? Any idea how often they occur and what ride or whatever breaks down the most?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh, THIS is a good question.</p>
<p>First, let’s discuss benefits. Normal park admission for one day to one park only is $87.33. Some people have to save up for a year to get in with their families for just one day. They drill this into us at orientation to make sure that we’re always on our best behavior, and doing the utmost to please them. It would be really shitty of us if they worked their asses off to get there, and then they get treated poorly all day.</p>
<p>The first perk is completely free, unlimited access to any of the parks. That means you can go to as many parks as you want as many times as you want on any given day for no charge. This isn’t hax, like sneaking in through the back with your ID or something, this is an explicit benefit.</p>
<p>The next one would be main gate passes. It should be noted that your ID only gets you in. Say your friends are coming to visit, and they’re a little short on cash. You can use this little blue card they give you to get them into one park for one day free. You can only use this four times per year, though. So, that’s four friends in one go, or four one at a time over the course of the year, etc.</p>
<p>Another perk is the power of the discount. Say you’re chilling in the park on your day off, and you’re hungry. Food prices are ridiculous, right? WRONG! Just hand them that cast member ID, and they’ll take 20% off. Same thing applies to merchandise. Even Disney property hotel rooms! Though, I imagine 20% of $900 a night is still a bit out of my price range.</p>
<p>Lastly, cast member only attraction previews. Before thay open new rides to the public, you get to beta test them. Sometimes a month in advance.</p>
<p>Drawbacks: Disney is not the best money out there. In fact, you can make more money working as a cashier at Einstien Bothers’ bagels than you can working full time there. It wasn’t easy for me to see some really intelligent people struggling to pay rent and their bills on minimum wage. My superiors included. People who had been working there for four years.</p>
<p>There have been deaths in the past, but no major accidents to my knowledege while I was working there. Though, one cast member was walking to her car during a thunderstorm, and she got struck by lightning. She recovered, though. Oh, one kid did die while I was there. It wasn’t in the parks, but he was on his bicycle, and he got hit by a Disney bus. When guests do get hurt in the park, it’s never the rides. It’s their own stupidity. They get up somewhere they shouldn’t and fall, or gash their legs on something.</p>
<p>As far as rides breaking down: Space Mountain. Always Space Fucking Mountain. Like at least once a day for twenty minutes or so.</p>
<p>For the whatever: parades. Parades almost never go out 100%. There will almost always be some minor glitch that causes one or two characters to not go out. Or, you’re like me, and accidentally down an entire float.</p>

<p>Nope :S</p>
<p>I was in New Street station briefly a couple of weeks ago on my way to visit someone in Aberystwyth university but never actually been into Birmingham itself…probably yet another person that looks like me :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>Umm, I’m not exactly sure about that one. If I had to guess, I would say it was the railroad. Since trains were a big thing for Disney, I’m sure he probably wanted them up and running on the first day. Also, because it’s kind of a feature as much as it is a ride. As far as “ride” rides, I couldnt say.</p>
