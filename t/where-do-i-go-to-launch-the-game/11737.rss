    <title>Where do I go to Launch the Game?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/where-do-i-go-to-launch-the-game/11737</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve installed the game, no problems there. After it installed and it asked me if I wanted to run the game I said no because I had some stuff I had to finish doing before I could play.  And now I wish to play and I cannot find a file that will let me launch the game anywhere.  :frowning:   Where is this file?</description>
