    <title>Several glitches/map exploits</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/several-glitches-map-exploits/14987</link>
    <description>I found a couple glitches while doing a casual playthrough of Black Mesa.

1) bm_c1a4b, in the silo, the map with the tentacles in it, just before the scientist that tells you to fire a rocket engine.
Co-ords: setpos -1560.004028 -2228.456055 1600.031250;setang 40.014839 141.962234 0.000000
It&#39;s a weird clipping issue; I killed the zombie here, and just smacked it with the crowbar a bit, then it clipped through the floor, not completely, as its feet were still above the floor and was hanging.

2) bm_c1a4b, the tentacle room
Sorry I couldn&#39;t get co-ords, if you want me to spit out coordinates just tell me  :slight_smile:  
That guard that opens the door and shoots at the tentacles and is killed, can be made invincible.
It might be luck, however, I found and reproduced this glitch via some saves.
The second time, when I reproduced it, I saved just before the guard got killed by a tentacle. When I loaded the save, the tentacle hit the guard, but he didn&#39;t die, and does not die for any more tentacle strikes.

Sorry if any or all of these bugs have been reported. I&#39;m fairly new here.

EDIT: In bm_c2a1a, the one where you fall down cause of the poorly built giant pipe, you can get to the other side using explosion propulsion. See the image below.

EDIT2: Map exploits in [i]Apprehension (bm_c2a3b)[/i], using non-intended methods to bypass the piston jumping puzzle, in one instance where I jump the puzzle w/out activating the pistons, and the other where I use physics objects to climb over a box.
Down below is a poorly made YouTube video describing all the issues listed above.
