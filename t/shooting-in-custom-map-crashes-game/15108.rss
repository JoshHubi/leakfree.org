    <title>Shooting in custom map crashes game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shooting-in-custom-map-crashes-game/15108</link>
    <description>EDIT 2: Apparently I compiled the map without HDR. That caused the particle effects to bug out and crash the game. Please lock the thread. Thanks!

I&#39;m developing a custom map for a Black Mesa mod. But there&#39;s a problem. Whenever I shoot or hit a world brush on the map, the game crashes.

Why?
I&#39;ve played on the official maps and have not had this problem.
???

Thanks.

EDIT: Shooting NPC&#39;s also crashes the game, but without an error dialogue.</description>

            <p>Glad you figured out the cause (I was coming in here to tell you to compile with RAD/HDR) but this thread is definitely one that needs attention from the devs, IMO. It’s an issue that can be worked around, but it’s still an issue, and it slows down development time by causing designers to have to re-compile their lighting when making only gameplay tweaks.</p>
