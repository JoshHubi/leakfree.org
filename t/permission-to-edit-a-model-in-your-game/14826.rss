    <title>Permission to edit a Model in your game?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/permission-to-edit-a-model-in-your-game/14826</link>
    <description>Hello there.

I don&#39;t like to work on people&#39;s content without their consent, no matter how big or small their overall projects are. So I was wondering if I could modify the am_blastdoor_top/bottom/frame models.

aka these ones. [youtu.be/8utqBcQDxxE?t=8m14s](https://youtu.be/8utqBcQDxxE?t=8m14s)

I&#39;ll be using it for a non-commerical Garry&#39;s Mod gamemode I&#39;ve been working for sometime, I have tried to get in contact with it&#39;s modeler Mark. Foreman via email but had no luck getting a response from him. Was hoping if the Devs are cool with it, or there is some sort of policy on using  BMS content for non-commercial use. Thanks</description>

            <p>Yeah. This is a big bump and a half. But After not doing as much as I like on this project for the time I last made this post. I’m back at it. And thanks for your permission.</p>
<p>But I’m really struggling to work on the door without it’s bake files or its diffuse files. Would any know if there was such content made available? Or if they ever will be? I could wing it with photoshopping the VTF file… But I don’t have much hope for good results with that.</p>

            <p>As long as it’s noncommercial, it’s no problem at all. Go for it!</p>
<p>And just for your information, the assets belong to the team as a whole, not the individual modeller. That would be a nightmare, otherwise!</p>

            <p>Those models are in the free version of BM which was released with a standard CC license, meaning you can use them in your own projects so long as you credit the team. Bonus points if you modify them.</p>

            <p>Yeah I noticed that on my end when I first made my post, just assumed it was only me. Interesting forum bug.</p>
<p>But I’m actually talking about the door at 8:13</p>

<p>The piece he’s talking about is at 5:45. If you go to the video directly by clicking the little YouTube button next to the fullscreen button, the video should have the timestamp with it.</p>
