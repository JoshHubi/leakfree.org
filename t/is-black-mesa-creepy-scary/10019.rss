    <title>Is Black Mesa Creepy/Scary</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-black-mesa-creepy-scary/10019</link>
    <description>Just Asking, is Black Mesa a bit of creepy/scary, was one of the devs aim was to make some chapters or moments creepy? 

i just hate creepy and scary games, i played Half Life 2 and it&#39;s episodes and rarely something happens to make me hop from my chair, even in Ravenholm, but I&#39;ve got that feeling that one of the games aims was to be creepy in some way, so is it scary and creepy? what was the most scary chapter and the moment that made you hop in the game? 

I just want to know, as it will decided my decision of downloading the mod the moment i can, oh, and i also want know what you say about the game being scary/creepy  :wink:</description>

            <p>Goto agree about the Ichthyosaur, but i’m grateful for it really!</p>
<p>As soon as I realised I was coming upto that moment and the scripted event showing the Ichthyosaur happened I paused the game in fear  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> . But I got the courage and for some reason it was way easier and less scary than I expected. It took two hits and I didn’t even have to really leave the cage!</p>
<p>That said, the bit after, theres a giant flooded area which seemed to have two in? That scared me but for some reason I was able to avoid it and got to the next chapter.</p>
<p>Whats the point of that area? Is it for anything? secret area? I jumped in the water and it seemed deep like there were places to go but I guess it wasn’t important for progression.</p>

            <p>It definitely has its moments of spookiness. Visually, the atmosphere is just about perfect in every level so far… I only wish that the ambient sounds/music were a little more effective to really induce the pants-shitting. This aspect can not be understated in a spooky/atmospheric game. I think that Dead Space 1 &amp; 2 take the blue ribbon on that.</p>
<p>One other thing that I keep thinking BM is lacking somewhat is <span class="bbcode-b">flickering lights</span>. There are some in here, for sure, and I am not going to make a harsh criticism of lighting until finishing BM, but so far it seems that when lights do flicker, more often than not there is still ambient light that is lighting up the area and it is not going <span class="bbcode-b">dark</span> in between the flickers. The mod Dangerous World used this to great effect in corridors etc. DW had some of the scariest moments of any mod I have played.</p>
<p>But I am completely LOVING BM… it is like a dream come true… getting a tear in my eye… back to game…</p>

<p>if you have read what i said, then you should know that i play lots of FPS games, i mainly play FPS games, and i am not in a mood to list them, anyway i came to the Conclusion that this game is not and doesn’t intent to be a survival horror like in some (or all) chapters, so i am getting the the moment i can…damn my limited internet monthly balance!</p>

            <p>Did anybody else think that the Icthyosaurs weren’t nearly as scary in BM as the original? In the original, you had black silhouettes speeding round the water making that grumbling sound made me freak every time. But in BM, you can see them clearly from much further away, they’re silent and they only take a few shots to kill.</p>
<p>For me, the only 2 real ‘scary’ bits in any Half Life game were this in the original HL, and the bit in Opposing Force where you go through a pitch black underground tunnel with shitloads of Voltigores (which are massive, can kill you in a shot and take ~5 hits from a rocket to kill).</p>
<p>But BM? BM isn’t scary.</p>

<p>I always thought that low-res textures and  less graphical quality make games more scary, if i would make a game scary i would never choose to make it have high-res texture and awesome graphics, it will make it less scary, which is one of the reasons that even the creepiest levels in Crysis 2 with aliens in a abandoned area at the dark night barely scare me.</p>

<p>I find the whole Half-Life series to have creepy/scary parts. I really enjoy creepy/scary in a game, as it makes the experience more real, and every time it makes me jump I enjoy a little adrenaline rush. If you have a tolerance for that sort of thing, it can be really enjoyable.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>even tough i don’t like creepy and scary games, i find myself for some reason enjoying the creepy levels in the Half Life Series.<br>
Half Life had…well i haven’t played that…</p>
<p>HL2 had Ravenholm, i heard about Ravenholm and i was unsure that i would survive, but i found it fun for most of time. But, well, i used a walkthrough the first time i played through Ravenholm, but after the first time, i could play any time, day or night, light off or lights on, it’s no longer creepy after the first time</p>
<p>HL2:Episode 1 had lowlife, while it wasn’t as lonely as Ravenholm due to alyx, but it was maybe half what Ravenholm was, but it is Episode 1’s creepy zombie level</p>
<p>HL2: Episode 2, I hate Freeman Pointfex, despite the level being in the sunlight with alyx sniping zombies for you sometimes, i still jump even after the first time, that Toxic Zombie near the beginning scares me every time, a strange fast breathing sound is heard, i duck into a small room, there is a door with a small window, i thought i saw something behind the window, i duck out the room, the breathing sound is still there…i enter the room again and BOOM! the Toxic Zombie smash’s the door and i semi-scream :fffuuu:.<br>
I also hate the room filled with '‘dead’ zombies, you slowly enter, suddenly the door shuts and the lights are off, you turn the flash light on, you find hordes of zombies coming your way :aah:.</p>

            <p>If you have never played a scary game, Half-Life (or Black Mesa in this instance) will cause you to turn inside out. The game is no longer too scary for me after playing Dead Space, though.</p>
<p>By the way, Ravenholm was the one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a video game. I just wanted to get the fuck out of there.</p>

            <p>Dead NPCs are really realistic.  The stark change from your live colleagues to half of them being dead and the other half being zombies is really well done in BM.  The overall atmosphere in Unforeseen Consequences is slightly nerve-wracking in a way that HL1 could not be (due to limited graphical abilities).  This, though,  is nothing to shy away from.  This makes the game feel very real.</p>

            <p>It’s most definitely creepy. A few times I was scared, especially with the Gargantuan running after me. HL/BMS creates this sort of ambiance that makes you feel more part of the game and due to the high amount of detail and animations, there are quite a few times where you get those thoughts in your head like omfg, what are they building! The entire Black Mesa complex is humongous, the sheer scale is enough to take one’s breath away, leaving you in awe.</p>

<p>Yea, especially with those huge red predator eyes.  Makes me kind of glad they attack from a distance.</p>

            <p>So far, most of it has been pretty “creepy”, the new zombies are really creepy, Office Complex and Unforeseen Consequences is eerie and creepy, etc.</p>
<p>But let me just say this. While I got scared of ravenholm the first time I played (I was young) I was not any time after that in HL2. I haven’t actually been <span class="bbcode-i">scared</span> of a game in years probably, but the Ichthyosaur’s introduction in BM literally left me standing there with my <span class="bbcode-i">eyes wide open</span>. I wish they weren’t so easy to kill though, because even though their intro is great, like Insomniak said, they go down in 2 crossbow darts ^ If they change that, then they will probably scare me like the intro did.</p>

            <p>I find the whole Half-Life series to have creepy/scary parts. I really enjoy creepy/scary in a game, as it makes the experience more real, and every time it makes me jump I enjoy a little adrenaline rush. If you have a tolerance for that sort of thing, it can be really enjoyable.</p>

            <p>The beginning is a bit creepy. Maybe even scary if you’ve never played a video game before.</p>
<p>If you’ve played other scary games, then you probably already got immune to the mildly scary atmosphere that you may find here and there in Black Mesa. But nothing in Black Mesa is as scary as Ravenholm, and Ravenholm wasn’t even that scary…</p>

            <p>As someone who had <span class="bbcode-i">serious </span>problems with <em>twitch</em> Ravenholm <em>twitch</em> I would say Black Mesa isn’t scary.<br>
Sure it can surprise you at times and make you jump maybe, but scary? No, it doesn’t really play for that.</p>

            <p>Indeed Unforseen Consequences was pretty scary.</p>
<p>Also, there was a moment in Blast Pit where I was looking at a huge pit down, and then like 5 houndeyes spawned and pushed me in that acid. Really scared me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  Also the tentacles are creepy. Like when you have to break some wood with your crowbar you have a feeling that it’s going to attack and kill you and if it really does, you get really scared  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
