Just came across this and recorded this on my second playthrough, and I figured it couldn&#39;t be a glitch because that would be a very specific glitch, although when I loaded my game and tried restarting the chapter and doing the same thing he just acted like a normal scientist.</description>

            <p>Haha, I lol’d. Most likely just an odd NPC AI glitch though, considering the mod is still young. Still, very fitting considering the environment though, and makes you wonder if it’s not.</p>

            <p>This is amazing! I love this, I know it’s probably a glitch but it could be made into some awesome horror game! I wonder what would happen if you didn’t turn around for a longer time… How long would he follow you for?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  Can you try that?</p>
