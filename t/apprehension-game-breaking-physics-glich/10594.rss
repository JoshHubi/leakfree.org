    <description>Map bm_c2a3b
chapter Apprehension

If you toss a barrel into the pipe before you start the generator button, and then start it with a barrel inside, the pylons get stuck and don&#39;t get unstuck
no matter what you do. Explosion doesn&#39;t help. Also, barrels are all over the place so it is easy to produce this glitch, and then there is no way of progress.
Maybe you can solve this by adding invisible wall for props, like the one before entering the test chamber in AM. Just my two cents.

            <p>I understand your point, but I do consider throwing those barrels into the generator to be a ‘forced glitch’. Whether or not you’re trying to exploit obvious game limitations (map size, barriers, etc) or just throwing things around like so.</p>
<p>What obviously happened is that you got more than you bargained for and suddenly you’re totally stuck. I hope you have a save beforehand, obviously  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Sure, this bug needs fixing too, amongst many, many others regardless of the ‘type’ of bug it is. I wonder how many people saw those barrels and thought of throwing them in. I’ve thrown as much stuff as I can in fans/generators etc. so far haha!</p>

            <p>Well, for me, a forced glitch is something like stacking a bunch of things and climbing into a 10 feet high air-duct. Of course you will fall out of the map, it was not something most players will do so devs don’t pay attention to that… But this is different. Just one barrel, toss, and game is broken.<br>
I did a lot of level design in my days, mostly in hammer editor and I know it’s almost impossible to find all of the exploits. And that was HL1, before physics, man. Now, it’s a nightmare, you can grab or toss or stack anything. And all of us like to play with physics.<br>
But these are major things and need to be fixed. At least, let the game recognize that the pylons are broken and trigger game over (black screen type of mission failure).</p>

            <p>Funnily enough, I did this too but this was a forced glitch so I didn’t bother posting it. Pretty hilarious though. Did you know, if you jump on there before the 2 pieces touch the barrel, that you won’t get squashed even though it should certainly kill you. It just stops you from moving and in some cases you’ll receive a ‘minor fracture’.</p>
<p>Hey I know. Maybe those barrels are super magnets from Aperture science or something!</p>
