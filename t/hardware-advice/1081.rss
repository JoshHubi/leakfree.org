    <description>This is not the first thread I have made on this topic, and probably not the last.
My question is, what part in my computer should I replace to best improve performance?
Currently, it&#39;s just a standard DEll Dimension 9150, with some extra RAM and an 9800 GT rammed in.
If you need actual specs, tell me, and I will provide them.
Thanks in advance.

Oh, and will I need a new case if I am to continue modifying, because I have heard that dell cases will often not fit non dell hardware.</description>

<p>If your computer can support it, I suggest nabbing a Quad-Core or an i7. I upgraded from a dual core to a quad core (my motherboard is not compatible with i7’s) and my performance is more than doubled in every game. It’s amazing!</p>

<p>That means your CPU was the bottleneck in your system, the CPU is not the only thing that’s important in a PC, especially for gaming.</p>
<p>Your advice can be misleading, for example for people with built-in intel graphics, they can upgrade to the fastest quad core on the market and still get 12fps in Half-Life 2…</p>

<p>The way I try to decide what power supply I need, is I figure out how much power the GPU needs, and then I add 250 watts or so. It’s not a perfect system or anything, but it hasn’t failed me yet.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well it depends on what you plan on sticking in there.<br>
A default Dell PSU from a crappy old pc probably isn’t strong enough to be able to supply a new motherboard, a new cpu and a new videocard.<br>
Which will definatly consume more power than your current stuff.</p>
<p>I’d recommend a CoolerMaster CM690 for a case. Got one myself.<br>
They’re very big. So lots of space and lots of airflow.<br>
(And they look cool too ;D. Oh, and they ain’t too expensive)</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Be careful about getting your mobo in, sometimes Dell and HP have shittily designed cases where you have to take off both sides and the front just to remove the hard drive, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it was next to impossible to replace.</p>
<p>Then again, old Dell cases are a lot better then their new ones, so I wouldn’t expect you to have many problems.</p>

            <p>Well what are the main things you are looking for in the motherboard? Will you overclock? Are you going with Core2? AM2? What is important here? How are you buying this board? through online retailer? which one? I think it’s best to work within what you want, and what you plan to do.</p>

            <p>Almost definitely. If it can’t fit a standard ATX motherboard, there is some fairly decent microATX boards out there. Motherboards follow standards, so I’m betting your board if not ATX, is at least micro ATX.</p>

            <p>No C2D support for that mobo. Board doesn’t do the FSB required.<br>
I don’t think that chipset would allow for it either anyhow.</p>

            <p>I’ll save you the trouble and say it’s most likely NOT compatible, since you have a pentium D and the Core 2 series have a different voltage and architecture created after the motherboard was released.</p>

            <p>Or you know just load up a small piece of software and read it off there. I’m not sure you realize this but some of those budget mobos do not have clear markings on them as to what they are. In some cases you have to look up the model by the serial on the board.<br>
Why open up the machine when CPUz will tell you in 2 seconds?</p>

            <p>Yeah I’ve got the cheapest mobo from ASUS and I still managed to overclock my CPU from 2.2 to 2.98ghz which forced my ram to run at 1000mhz which is perfect since it’s 1066mhz OCZ.</p>
<p>Haven’t had a crash since forever, and I leave this PC on whenever it’s downloading something…</p>

            <p>Stability is a BS reason to upgrade your motherboard. If you’re is working fine, then it’s fine.<br>
Reasons why you should upgrade though are more slots (for ram, pci cards or whatever you want to put in), ability to take advantage of new and faster hardware (usb 3.0 is rumored to be coming out this year or early next, and I don’t know what kind of RAM your mobo supports, but I’m sure there’s faster stuff out now that it doesn’t work with).</p>
