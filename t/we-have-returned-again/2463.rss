            <p>The server is back online. A fsck from an external Linux system was able to correct the detected file system errors that we found on the servers hard drive.</p>
<p>As we have returned, we might have to plan some downtime in the near future (the next few hours) as our hard drive contains some bad sectors. For the moment that data is remapped to other clean sectors. We will up to RAID-1 with another 250 gig hard drive and re-install the OS. I will let you all know when we will be doing this.</p>

<p>True. Josh Hubi, how confident are you that your web hosting will remain up during the massive influx of people that are going to try to download BMS the day its released?</p>

</aside>
<p>Or, there could be 2-4 mirrors on sites such as Mediafire, Rapidshare (Although I’m not sure about file-size limit on this one), MegaUpload, and a few others. Sure there is the issue of having to create “Pro” accounts, but having multiple uploads on one site and multiple uploads on another would drastically reduce the amount of time people will be on the BMS forums.</p>
