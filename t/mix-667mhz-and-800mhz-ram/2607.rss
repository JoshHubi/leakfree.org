    <title>Mix 667MHz and 800MHz ram?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mix-667mhz-and-800mhz-ram/2607</link>
    <description>I currently have 2x1GB DDR2-667 RAM Dual-Channel installed and have an E8400 Core 2 Duo (FSB=1333MHz). As I understand it, it&#39;s best for your RAM&#39;s speed to be at least half the FSB speed of your CPU (in the case of DDR2).

Now, I can&#39;t really find the same set of RAM I currently have in my local PC store, but they do have a 2x1GB DDR2-800 RAM Dual-Channel set (Corsair XMS2, just like my current set), so can I just mix this with my current set?

I also just ordered Windows 7 Professional 64bit OEM, so 4GB of RAM seems a nice step up from 2GB  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

            <p>yes, a BIOS-update often helps a lot and mostly kills errors like them you’ve had. i wasn’t here a few days so i’ve just seen the problems you had.</p>

            <p>I did it! I managed to install the 4GB of RAM and install Windows 7 64 bit. I had to change something in my BIOS, I knew about this setting but I didn’t want to do it because it means I can’t install a 32 bit OS. I wanted to dual-boot between WinXp (32bit) and Win7 (64bit), but I guess this’ll have to do.</p>
<p>Thank goodness I managed to solve this, it was driving me nuts  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I’ve installed only 1GB of the extra RAM and now my PC still runs fine with 3GB, but everytime I add the 4th GB it becomes unstable.</p>
<p>Still, if anyone knows what the problem could be, it would mean a lot to me.</p>

            <p>No, I’ll be trying that tomorrow, but I don’t think that’s the problem. My BIOS did recognise the full 4GB RAM.</p>
<p>I can’t wholly rule out the possibility that my PSU can’t keep up. Could anyone see if this is enough:</p>
<p>Antec 550W PSU (worked so far)<br>
Asus P5W DH Deluxe<br>
Core 2 Duo E8400 3.0GHz<br>
3xSATA HDD<br>
Asus HD3870 512MB GDDR3<br>
X-Fi Xtreme Music<br>
3x80mm fans<br>
DVD reader and DVD burner<br>
2x1GB DDR2-667 RAM</p>
<p>So far my PSU has served me well, and I refuse to believe that the extra 2GB could be too much. But I can’t rule it out, so what do you guys think? Is it good enough?</p>
<p>I’m going to bed, feel free to make suggestions, I’ll try some more tomorrow  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Tough luck, it sounds like a classic chipset-ram incompatibility, the chances of that were pretty low considering the other pair is compatible.</p>
<p>Have you tried booting with only the new ram?</p>

            <p>FUUUUUUCK !!! I just cleaned out my PC and installed the extra 2GB and ever since then it keeps rebooting every time I try to boot Windows or a Linux Live CD. I’ve uninstalled the extra RAM for now and my PC works fine, but obviously I’d like to put this newly-bought RAM to good use.</p>
<p>The BIOS recognised the 4GB of physical RAM but said that only 3.2GB was available and 800MB was appropriated, I understand that 32bit programmes can’t make full use of the 4GB RAM but does that include the BIOS? Although, it’s probably 16bit itself.</p>
<p>I’ve gone through the manual and BIOS and can’t find anything wrong. It <em>should</em> work. I left my original Corsair XMS2 2x1GB DDR2-667 in bank 1 (orange slots), and installed my new Corsair XMS2 2x1GB DDR2-800 in bank 2 (black slots).</p>
<p>EDIT: These are the specs for my RAM;</p>
<p>My current Corsair XMS2 2x1GB DDR2-667 set has 4-4-4-12 (printed on the RAM), this is what CPU-Z has to say;<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
Don’t know what the difference between JEDEC 1&amp;2 is.</p>
<p>My new Corsair XMS2 2x1GB DDR2-800 set has 5-5-5-18 (printed on the RAM), I did notice that my new RAM runs at 1.9V whereas the original runs at 1.8V, is this a problem?</p>
<p>Please, if anyone can help I would very much appreciate it.</p>
<p>On top of that, when I started WinXP after removing the extra RAM I got a “Delayed Writing” error for my new external HDD. I just finished putting everything I wanted to keep on this HDD so that I could reformat my old HDDs and do a clean install of Windows 7. And now I might’ve lost everything on it!</p>

<p>if you don’t want to oc then you will be fine with 2 different rams if they’re from the same manufacturerer and type and the faster one will run at the speed of the slower one then (both at 667 mhz).</p>

<p>I don’t plan on overclocking it, I don’t mind that the new RAM runs slower. 667MHz is good enough for my CPU (FSB 1333MHz). The benefits are mainly the double RAM  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Well, they’re both from Corsair, and they’re even from the same line (XMS2).</p>

            <p>You’re right, but you should pay more attention to the brand, some brands really don’t like being mixed together. It’s also better to have the same number of chips on each stick, a double sided stick working together with a single side is a pretty bad setup.</p>

            <p>Anyone? I’m pretty sure you can, only the faster RAM will be clocked to the slower one.</p>
<p>Still, it’d be nice if anyone could confirm this, I’m planning on picking up my new HDD tomorrow and I could also buy the new RAM.</p>

            <p>I currently have 2x1GB DDR2-667 RAM Dual-Channel installed and have an E8400 Core 2 Duo (FSB=1333MHz). As I understand it, it’s best for your RAM’s speed to be at least half the FSB speed of your CPU (in the case of DDR2).</p>
<p>Now, I can’t really find the same set of RAM I currently have in my local PC store, but they do have a 2x1GB DDR2-800 RAM Dual-Channel set (Corsair XMS2, just like my current set), so can I just mix this with my current set?</p>
<p>I also just ordered Windows 7 Professional 64bit OEM, so 4GB of RAM seems a nice step up from 2GB  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
