    <title>Can&#39;t play any games due to green screen</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-play-any-games-due-to-green-screen/6627</link>
    <description>Okay, yesterday when playing ARMA 2 I got this weird green screen when playing, where parts of the screen turned to bright or dark green, and sometimes the entire screen. Static &quot;noise&quot; also appeared in parts of the screen, and the bottom and top portions started having interference, where it looked they were fading in and out. As far as I know this only happens when I play games (not just ARMA 2, all games that aren&#39;t browser based) and not during regular computer use, e.g. typing documents, creating presentations or using my browser. Another pain in the ass is that the computer as a whole just freezes and does absolute jack shit, so I have to turn the power off from the computer&#39;s power button and then turn it on again.

In case it helps, here are my specs

Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.8 Ghz
Video Card: Nvidia Geforce 8800 GT 512 MB
Operating System: Windows 7 Professional 64-bit

In case anybody knows a solution or can help me out, I&#39;d appreciate it if it came speedily.  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>K my best guess is that your gpu is defective.</p>
<p>66 celsius is hot, but not hot enough to make your game’s go on the fritz. The most you would get from 66 is maybe some lag, but not much.</p>
<p>How long have you had your Video card?</p>
<p>I doubt its the cpu, but hey, you never know.</p>
<p>Edit: Took a look at my original post, and saw how illiterate it made me look, so i fixed it(:</p>

<p>Definitely a GPU issue. It might be bad, who knows. Do you have sufficient power supplied to the card? I’ve seen many cards that require extra power act really fucked up when they don’t get enough (artifacts and such). How many watts is your PSU? If this isn’t the problem, then I’m almost certain the card is trash.</p>

<p>My PSU is fine- I have about 950 watts going on a card that only requires 650.</p>
<p>I’ve had this card for about two or three years (it all depends on what year they started making 8800’s- it was the year after I got mine.), so you know maybe it is trash. If it is, then fuck. My family was probably going to move into a condo and we need all the money we can get.</p>
<p>I’ll call nVidia support on Monday and see if they know anything about the error messages. If not, some place better give me a goddamn job soon so I can pay for a new graphics card.</p>

<p>Okay, according to nvidia Monitor, my GPU runs at 66 degrees Celsius, and I’m not sure if that’s an optimal/good temperature or not.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, when running the benchmark (or anything OpenGL) I get the error message “Too many errors occured. Error Code:2” and have no idea what the hell any of  it means. Apparently the drivers also crash every time I attempt to start a game but then recover according to a windows error message on the taskbar, so at least I’m not freezing up anymore.</p>

<p>EDIT: Or it could just simply be overheating. Do these graphics troubles appear instantly as soon as the game is fired up or over time?</p>

            <p>Monitor the temp of your video card during heavy gaming. Is your power supply sufficient for your video card? Maybe it’s at fault, or malfunctioning.</p>

            <p>One of your components aren’t any good.</p>
<p>Don’t update your drivers, or do any of that shit, it won’t work.</p>
<p>The fact that your duo runs at 1.8 ghz is scary, so that MIGHT, be the problem, but i’m almost positive either your gpu, cpu, or your mobo are no good.</p>
<p>Take it to a computer repair shop, they might find the problem, but i doubt it d:</p>

            <p>Try updating your GPU drivers too. Also see if it’s not overheating. And finally try to change your game’s setting, IIRC Arma 2’s pretty graphic intensive and your GPU’s not really up to today’s standards.</p>

            <p>What kind of monitor is it?</p>
<p>If it’s CRT, degauss it. If it’s LCD/HD, try it on another computer and see if it still fucks up.</p>
<p>If it does, replace it.</p>
<p>But if it only fucks up during games it’s probably one of your components at fault</p>
