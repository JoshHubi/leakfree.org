    <title>Having an issue with bodies falling through floors/disappearing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/having-an-issue-with-bodies-falling-through-floors-disappearing/10530</link>
    <description>Please forgive me if I did anything wrong, I am very new here and I figure I would try to seek answers here seeing as I can&#39;t find any elsewhere.

I suppose this would work for the &quot;Bug/glitch&quot; section of the forums, but I decided to post it in the help section to see if anyone had an answer or has encountered the same issue.

Ever since I started playing the game, the bodies of my fallen enemies fall straight through the floor never to be seen again. In rare instances, the bodies fall to the floor but then fade away right after. I&#39;ve watched some play through it on youtube and they don&#39;t seem to be having my issue. Has anyone encountered this? Does anyone have a solution or idea?</description>
