    <title>BBMIP: Part 4</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bbmip-part-4/13109</link>
    <description>For this week we have moved from AM to UC. Keep in mind this isn&#39;t a exhaustive list of the props that are added just a sampling. The main major changes model wise were the additions of all the cabinets into AM/UC. After I got done with what I thought was all the cabinets, Jonathan pointed out that there were just the Pre-RC ones. Yay.....so I had to go back and rework some of the models to be more broken down and smashed up fpr UC. The result is the first series of pictures from lab 3. The first is just a screen grab from the modeling program and the 2nd is a render of the final model in toolbag. Once it&#39;s in game you realize 90% of the players won&#39;t even see the cabinet lol.

<p>No the idea was to update people on things happening. Your opinions  really won’t change things one way or the other (shocking I know), but look at it from my side I get at least 6 or 7 of these “opinions” every time I post and its not a suggestion, its change this it looks bad to me etc. I might just lock the threads after posting and you can do your own discussion thread that I won’t take part in. I don’t have to do these and if you keep pissing me off then I really won’t do them. As it is I just had a heart attack Friday and you won’t get any updates for a while. I just might quit this altogether because of some of the attitudes I get.</p>
<p>Mods please lock this thread.</p>

<p>Give an itch, take a mile, yada yada, etc., etc.</p>
<p>My theory is they’ve got little to go on, but instead of just moving on, feel that they <span class="bbcode-i">absolutely have</span> to give something, or otherwise have a voice, so they go to tiny details.</p>
<p>In the cabinet’s case, the cabinet doors are fine. I’ve seen broken cabinets look just like that. In fact, other ways I’ve seen broken cabinets hang looks so ridiculous if it had been seen in a game most would think some physics glitch was at play. Hinged objects are weird.</p>

<p>I can’t tell from your two posts on the issue if you’re trying to say a) the hanging doors look strange, or b) the way the doors are hanging looks strange. Which is it?</p>

<p>Without being really rude…you don’t know what you’re talking about. These cabinets are made for a specific spot not to be reused else where. The backs are flush and the sides have a toe kick similar to all the other cabinets in the game there is nothing that goes up next to them if there were they would be flush to whatever. There are tons of props throughout the game that clip through walls…these don’t. The countertops are brush work.</p>

            <p>Most players aren’t going to look at those map props for more than 5 seconds at a time. The people in this thread are just nitpicking because those props are being given all the focus in this particular instance but when given the big picture most everyone else won’t even notice those kinds of minutiae details.</p>

            <p>The cabinets you mention were based on the brush work cabinet. I didn’t want to model hinges on all the cabinet models and without those showing having the doors hanging realistically is kinda a moot point. So I just went with copying the references. As to the cable question…it’s one I have brought up several times. Problem is a 6 sided cylinder isn’t enough and 12 is probably too much unless it’s really big then you are going to get 24+. The you have to look at how long they are and how much they coil. You could realistically get 10k cables if there are several involved. I think the ones I posted are 7 or so. So it becomes an entity count issue and memory too. Who knows we may add some more and maybe we won’t.</p>
<p>As to the pictures remember they are all WIP. That means the GUI everything. What you buy when ever it is released may or may not be different.</p>

            <p>its all looking really good, although if you don’t mind me giving one criticism, cabinet hinges tend to be around 1/4 of the way down from the top (and bottom respectively). so it should be hanging from that point. It immidiatly really jars if you know what you are looking at. I know its only a few of the players that probably do, but still, its one of those immersion breakers when everything els is looking so good.</p>
<p>On another note? do you think it will push graphics cards too much if more cables are distributed around the place? They look really good, and if this really was a high tech research facility built in an old bunker, then it probably would need a hell of a lot more retrofitted cables about the place?</p>

            <p>Yeah, it also depends a bit on how the cables reacted when they snapped.  If they had a leftwards direction, it would pull more of the right-side of the cable through the loop holding it up than the left.  Looks fine to me, physics-wise.</p>

            <p>Looks fine to me. On the right, it looks like the hanging bit is pulling the rest of the cable taut. Not really seeing an issue.</p>

            <p>The right side is the left side recoiled back some that’s why the first loop is bigger than the rest. Without doing some complicated simulation to see exactly how they would fall I took a educated guess.</p>

<p>If there was a lot of downward pressure put on these wires, shouldn’t the ‘curved’ bits been pulled straight as pressure was put on the part that is now snapped?</p>

            <p>I must say I agree with everyone else. I really love the updated cabinet and cables. They look so good that I doubt there is space for any kind of criticism.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing, bkdale86.</p>
