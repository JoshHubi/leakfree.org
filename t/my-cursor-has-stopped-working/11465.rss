    <title>My cursor has stopped working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-cursor-has-stopped-working/11465</link>
    <description>I&#39;m typing this from my linux distro. The cursor on the windows side of my computer acts normal during the log-in screen but once one logs in, it ceases to move. 

This happened after playing black mesa a bit. The game stopped responding during a newly started game and my cursor suddenly stopped moving. I&#39;m using a Toshiba Satellite L875D-S7210. It&#39;s not a problem with the mousepad or anything physical...the mouse responds normally on linux and the keyboard works fine on the linux and the windows. 

I&#39;ve restarted multiple times. Not really sure where to go from here...</description>

<p>Are you running Windows virtualized or on a dual-boot? Did you try plugging your mouse to another USB port? Are you using the touchpad? If so, you should consider investing in a mouse, they are more natural for first person shooters.</p>

<p>I’m dual-booting. I’m at college and I left my mouse at home so the touchpad will have to do for now.</p>
<p>Think the problem will fix itself one i change cursor input from touchpad to mouse?</p>
