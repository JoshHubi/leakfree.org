    <title>Black Mesa In L4D: A Query</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-in-l4d-a-query/2440</link>
    <description>Hi there,

I&#39;ve come with a question mainly for the admins, regarding the possibility of myself converting the Black Mesa maps into a campaign for Left 4 Dead.

I have a project for Left 4 Dead called Lambda, which is here: [url]https://lambda-l4d.webs.com/[/url], [url]https://l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=3431[/url]. What I&#39;m aiming to accomplish is to convert as much of the Half-Life 2 storyline (but also the original Half-Life too, see below) as would be fun to play through into campaigns for Left 4 Dead, and have currently reached right from the City 17 station to the area just before the start of Water Hazard.

Someone recently contacted me through my site to suggest, amongst other feedback, that I converted Half-Life: Source into a campaign that would be precursor to the current Lambda campaign. In reply to my contact, he also suggested that I ask the Black Mesa team if it would be possible to use maps from the mod instead, so here I am.  :slight_smile: 

My method for the current campaign was to decompile each Half-Life: 2 map, clean it up in Hammer, remove irrelevant entities and complicated physics puzzles etc., add in crescendo events and other L4D-specific events and make sure that each map was sufficiently satisfying to play. Due to the fact that L4D does [i]not[/i] mount the standard Source content (which made my life most difficult), at the moment the Lambda campaign requires the user to extract the Source Materials.gcf and Source Models.gcf files to the relevant folders in Left 4 Dead.

I did this to avoid potential issues with unauthorised distribution of Valve&#39;s content to people who might not own the game; if someone is able to extract the content from their own computer, they must have access to the content and therefore have bought it at some point previously. I don&#39;t know how this issue would lie concerning Black Mesa since A. I don&#39;t know how much content I would use if I did convert the maps, B. The content is freely distributed with the mod anyway, but C. The mod may also utilise some of the Half-Life: 2 content from the GCFs that won&#39;t be available in L4D.

Anyway, my proposition is to have permission to use the maps from Black Mesa in order to create a Left 4 Dead campaign along the original Half-Life storyline. I think the best time for me to begin work on this would be after the mod is released, since everything would be ready, but I don&#39;t know what stage the development is at currently and it might be that some maps may already be fit for converting.

Whatever the case, I&#39;d love to hear back from people on this.

Many thanks.  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>I can understand that viewpoint. I thought that, seeing as it’s a mod, things would be somewhat more open than Valve, and I’m certainly not trying to intrude on development or anything, but in the end it is the devs’ say since they’ve been working hard for 5 years or something now.</p>

            <p>I think you deserve a chance, I know the devs have said they won’t release stuff, but I assume that seeing as you need to take out many of the puzzles and enemies to make it work, all you really need is the maps, so I can’t see them refusing to help a fellow modder…</p>

            <p>I don’t think you’re going to get the vmf files for Black Mesa’s levels, let alone authorization to use the other mod assets. This has been said numerous times in the past few years, if you searched you’d have known this.</p>
