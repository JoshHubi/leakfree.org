    <title>how to mod weapons in Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-mod-weapons-in-black-mesa/11971</link>
    <description>I have to mod the guns in this game to make it playable for me.

I did the same with HL2 and managed to get all my weapons to run inronsights and have realistic peramerters, including free aim (which is so cool in this engine).

ANyhow, the shooting controls in this most excelent mod are quite basic, not neccesaraly a bad thing, but I would love to have some modern reaction in this game, I can replace the models i assume, but i heard that one cannot change the viewmodel fov... which is essential for all HL2 games as the guns are so close to the screen it might as well be a console port.

That and I would like to be able to change the peramerters of the weapons, and I looked in the scripts and there wasent exactly allmost anything that one could change.

Could some one point me in the direction of getting started?

Also, the view model thing, thats a must, does anyone know how to get that comand to work?</description>

            <p>Also, some one asked me to post my work thus far… Its isnt much but i came up with some solutions to the problems, at least the speed ones, thanks to whoever posted that thing erlier…</p>
<p>Just add this to a Cfg file and add exec (your file) to the autoexec.cfg file and it should work, though i also bound the exec comand to a key incase i needed to reload it for whatever reason.</p>
<p>alias duck_t “duck_on”<br>
alias duck_on “alias duck_t duck_off; +duck; sv_maxspeed 190; developer 1; echo Ducking enabled; developer 0”<br>
alias duck_off “alias duck_t duck_on; -duck; developer 1; sv_maxspeed 155; echo Standing enabled; developer 0”</p>
<p>bind “CTRL” “duck_t”</p>
<p>alias walk_t “walk_on”<br>
alias walk_on “alias walk_t walk_off; walk_onn; developer 1 ; echo Walking enabled; developer 0”<br>
alias walk_off “alias walk_t walk_on; walk_offf; developer 1; echo Running enabled; developer 0”</p>
<p>bind “Tab” “walk_t”</p>
<p>Bind “shift” “+speed; sprint_t”</p>
<p>alias aim_t “aim_on”<br>
alias aim_on “viewmodel_fov 74; +walk ;fov_desired 79.659996; walk_t; alias aim_t aim_off”<br>
alias aim_off “alias aim_t aim_on; -walk; viewmodel_fov 84; fov_desired 90; walk_t”</p>
<p>bind “mouse2” “aim_t”</p>
<p>alias walk_onn “sv_maxspeed 100”<br>
alias walk_offf “sv_maxspeed 155”</p>
<p>alias sprint_t “sprint_on”<br>
alias sprint_on “alias sprint_t sprint_off; sv_maxspeed 320”<br>
alias sprint_off “alias sprint_t sprint_on; sv_maxspeed 155”</p>
<p>Of course this requires auto run to be off, but you can just reverse the values or something if you want auto run on, I just disabled the annoying sprint sound by replacing it with a blank noise, but whatever.</p>

            <p>not even sure what that means, though in the end i decided to suck it up and play through anyhow, there is just to much detail to ignore. Had to replace the soldiers dialogue with the originals, which is actualy a lot of work, ill post my finished results when im done editing the files… funny cause alltogether for everything but, the dialogue in the mod is far superior to the first, but whoever did the soldiers was waaay overzelous…</p>
<p>anyhow, this game still desperately needs a way to modify the permamerters of the guns (ie rate of fire and fire selection).</p>

            <p>They both fire 9mm rounds. At a guess, it’s because if the SMG had single-shot fire it would completely outclass the glock.</p>

            <p>whats the point of playing the game if all you have is the pistol??? its not like the gameplay is exactly inovative?</p>
<p>F*ck it, ive just been playing the original instead, but they need to go back to the originals settings for the mp5, dunno what the hell they were thinking with that crap.</p>

            <p>If the burst-fire on the SMG annoys you much that it renders the <span class="bbcode-i">entire game</span> unplayable for you, the beefed-up glock should be a perfectly good solution.</p>
<p>It’s not like SMGs and assault rifles are the only realistic weapons in the world.</p>

            <p>of course</p>
<p>Im at an impass though, I cannot play the game with the mp5 the way it is, dont the autoburst crap, and the fire rate being faster than any gun i can think of… it looks atrocious and feels atrocious…</p>
<p>I went back to playing the original (source) and sadly that game has most of the gore that was so cool from the original removed, i havent figured out how to get the gibs or bloody bodies back in it, though the movment controls and weapons handeling make it worth playing as opposed to the diliciously gory but ultimately unplayable black mesa source…</p>
<p>anyhow so untill i can figure out how to actualy edit the realy weapons properties, i have to put this on hold.</p>
<p>(Autoburst??? seriously??? common??? and that fire rate??? have you guys even shot a basic .22?.. uncool dudes).</p>
<p>also wish you could import cssource weapons or hl2 weapons and have the animations work, but ohwell…</p>

            <p>thats not it at all, and the realism vrs fun arugment is all preference anyhow, I just think that generic spaming of rounds was fun 15 years ago, is a lot less fun now. I want to feel like im actualy in the virtual enviroment.</p>

<p>You’re thinking of Doom, I think, not half-life. Doom’s controls would probably make you have a fit.</p>
<p>In any case, I could start an argument about realism vs. fun in video games and all that shit, but this isn’t the place for that.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you really want to feel like you have to bring your gun up, the simplest solution might just be to make the guns use the ‘lowered’ animation, like when you’re sprinting, until you press an ironsight key. It would still require some custom code, as far as I know, but it would be a lot simpler than adding new animations or making the viewmodels snap to the center of the screen. (SMod did it like that, I think.)</p>
<p>I’m not a programmer or anything, mind you. This is mostly just conjecture and hearsay.</p>

            <p>Hey, is there a way to re add the hand swaping, thats a big part of my macros, (gives the impression at least that for instance with my melee binds that one hand has the crow bar and the other has the gun.</p>
<p>also can make it seem like your leaning corners (hey its better than nothing).</p>
<p>cl_righthand thingy dosent seem to work…</p>
<p>Also…<br>
Thanks harrington for the walk binds, added that to my walk alias setup and it works fantastic. A little trickier with the sprint deal, but i made it so tab toggles walk or run, and sprint disregards that, and goes to sprint, then goes back to normal…</p>
<p>also to pyro…</p>
<p>In a fight, you bring up your weapon to aim it, thats just modern gameplay, i dont mean limiting, i mean like i dont wanna look as retarded as in rambo 2 when he headshots like 20 guys from the waist, it looks and feels crappy.</p>
<p>Ive never been a fan of over slowed down super zoomed in sights, in reality you wouldent do that, you would hold it out and aim accordingly, and only then you would do that for long shots, for short ones you would aim off the tip or on placment based on experiance… but either way your bringing up your gun to shoot, its a stability thing.</p>
<p>nothing irrelevent about imersing your character more by freedom of movment…</p>
<p>The first half life did wounders for that by placing the weapon at the center of the screen, as if it had allready been brought up (to the tip, not the sights) all I want is some way of atleast feeling like i can bring up my gun.</p>
<p>dunno why they went for the more consolitus gun coming out of the side of the screen thing.</p>

<p>You probably won’t be able to add iron sights without adding completely new animations, and possibly models as well. In any case it would be fairly complicated to do.</p>
<p>Incidentally, you’ve kinda pointed out why I’m not a big fan of ironsights. They’re often just an irrelevant reflex that doesn’t add very much to the game and really limits your mobility.</p>

            <p>Wahey, there’s a reason you have an edit button.<br>
It is generally for fixing mistakes but it’s also the reason pretty much no-one double posts.<br>
Or triple posts for that matter.</p>

            <p>allso, any tips on how to actualy fix the speed thing would be nice, cause running around the map break kneck is giving me a huge headache. any changes i make to either normal or walk get reset after i sprint.</p>
<p>BTW, sprint isnt normal, there was a walk in hl2 and a normal, and a sprint… the walk being 150, the norm 190 and the sprint 350</p>

            <p>IIRC, adjusting the walking/run speeds in BM has no effect at all, because of the modifications they made to the movement mechanics.</p>
<p>Also, if I’m not mistaken, there are only two speeds available, just like in HL2: “walk” and “run”.<br>
In HL2, “walk” is the default speed, “run” is the sprint speed. Same thing in BM, but you have to option of turning on “always run”, which will make your sprint button into a walk button.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can change the FOV per weapon in the weapons scripts (BMS/scripts/weapon_xx.txt), like so: <span class="bbcode-b">fov		“x”</span>. Most script files already have this value.</p>
<p>Check out the config file (cfg/skill.cfg) for anything to do with weapon stats, just like in HL2.</p>

</aside>
<p>thanks.</p>
<p>Is there a way i can add ironsights for weapons other than the 357, sorry i havent modded hl2 in over 4 years so im a touch rusty (eversince valve autoupdated the game and ruined all the old mods).</p>
<p>Also, is there a way to get a working walk button, i change the hl2 speed to 150, but every time i sprint it changes it back to 190 and walk seems to have no effect in this game.</p>
<p>If i could, i would change the walk to 120 or 150 then, after sprint i could just hit the walk, once i get it working and at least that toggle alias i have up for it would put it down to a speed so it didnt seem like i was skating around everywhere.</p>
