            <p>I dunno about the worst death but probably the worst fate in the HL series would be being turned into a Stalker.  That’s just horrifying.</p>
<p>So I guess I’d have to say being “killed” (captured) by any number of Combine and turned into a Stalker.</p>

            <p>Wow. This thread makes apparent all of the horrible possible ways to die in Half-Life.</p>
<p>I will be the hipster here and bring to light the unmentioned Gonome and Archer-fish.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Those fangly claws, jaws, and maws… so much worse than the Panthereye’s paws, as both of the things that I mentioned have spit, acidic solution which would make oneself shit.</span><br>
That incapacitating agent followed up by bloody brute-force… they have this in common with the Bullsquid and Barnacle. Little chance to fight back. Not fun without a hazard suit.</p>
<p>I haven’t even mentioned the terror of sewer-bound Voltigores, or the Lovecraftian Kingpin.</p>
<p>Forget everything mentioned to date. <span class="bbcode-b">Kingpin</span> has my final vote.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>For me, it depends on the instalment:* If we’re talking <span class="bbcode-i">Haλf-Life 1: Black Mesa</span>/<span class="bbcode-i">Haλf-Life 1: Blue Shift</span>/<span class="bbcode-i">Haλf-Life 1: Decay</span>, definitely the houndeye or the barnacle. The former because your organs being disintegrated by a sonic boom, complete with ruptured eardrums (with the possibility of explosives being thrown in) would be the most dreadful fate worse than death (a similar thing would happen if you actually survive a direct hit from a rocket propelled grenade, even with precautions that allow you to do so. Someone on YouTube did a discussion of this in a video exploring the physics of rocket jumping). The latter because your neck being snapped &amp; the resulting quadriplegia means you can’t fight back, even if you survive. At least if you’re smart enough to look up (unlike pretty much anyone who hasn’t played a VALVe game) than you’re okay, as they’re sessile.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <span class="bbcode-i">Haλf-Life 1: Opposing Force</span>, the answer would be the Shock Trooper’s Spore Grenades. Even if you survive, the gamete cells that have contaminated your body from the explosion would end up growing through your system, like many a fungal infection in real life (at least, that’s why I think Collective X decided to use explosive spore clusters as launcher grenades).</li>
<li>If we’re talking <span class="bbcode-i">Haλf-Life 2</span>/<span class="bbcode-i">Haλf-Life 2: Lost Coast</span>, definitely the Gunship’s machine cannon. The feeling of millions of bullets hitting you as you’re torn apart… I get the heebie-jeebies thinking about it. You can’t even fight back easily without <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa: Source</span> Hazardous Environment Combat Unit Human Marine Grunt Soldier-level reaction times, as every weapon that is effective against it can &amp; will be retaliated against by it.</li>
<li>For <span class="bbcode-i">Haλf-Life 2: Episode One</span>, the Zombine. The worst part is that it’s the parasite that’s making it kill itself to kill you, so you feel sorry for all those unfortunate zombified Combine soldiers suiciding you with grenades. Even if they were trying to kill me before, I just feel sad for killing them with no choice because they were zombified on top of being turned into mindless drone soldiers.</li>
<li>In <span class="bbcode-i">Haλf-Life 2:Episode Two</span>, certainly a Combine Advisor in a human host body. Note: Advisors can take human host bodies, it’s just changes to the storyline meant they were never able to do a scene incorporating this ability. Anyway, why wouldn’t I want to be killed by such a thing? Simple: being tortured, assaulted, &amp; raped (physically, psychically, &amp; spiritually) by such an altered human would break your mind to the point where you can feel what would be the most painful thing of all to feel if it were normal to be able to feel it: your soul being forced out of your body by your own mind &amp; going to the afterlife.</li>
</ul>

            <p>I’m surprised no one has said Manhack.  Can you imagine?  A flying circular saw cutting gouges in you, again and again, blood spraying everywhere.  Your arms are gradually sliced off as you try to protect yourself.  After a few minutes of this you collapse from blood loss, gurgling your last breath as it flies off to chop up someone else.</p>
<p>As for the first game: being a scientist lucky enough to survive the disaster, only to be gunned down by Gordon Freeman because he thinks it’s funny.</p>

            <p>It’s dark energy, not antimatter. If it were antimatter, it would just go “bang” and splash you with neutron and gamma radiation and neutrinos and shit.</p>

<p>I think so. Combine Soldiers scream before they get disintegrated, which can be in fear or in pain. The sensation may not last long but still, feeling it even for just one second won’t be very pleasant.</p>

<p>Advisors. God, that tongue licking me up until it finds my neck, and that one moment of drawback of the tongue just before it stabs through my neck, would just be the most terrifying feeling in the world.</p>

<p>The first time I played through that scene in the barn, and got pulled up to the advisor, I was practically squirming in my chair.</p>
<p>Every time since then, I just spend that scene staring at the screen with one eyebrow cocked, wondering what the art team was thinking.</p>

<p>That’s sort of heroic, not cowardly, like the Combine.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, that’s also really sad. The fruit of your efforts results in becoming a mindless worker drone that’s been scarred beyond human recognition. You’re changed to look like some demented Raggedy Ann doll.</p>
<p>For me, I REALLY don’t want to be dissolved by the AR2’s secondary fire, or similar devices. The feeling of having your atoms ripped apart, god, I wouldn’t want to experience that. Although that isn’t to say the other things mentioned aren’t a walk in the park either.</p>
