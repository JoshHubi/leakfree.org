    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m new to the forum so I&#39;m not sure if this topic has been posted before.

            <p>I got one for you all.  When was about 3-4-5-ish (don’t really remember), my grandfather received a game from my uncle (a very revolutionary one for the time I might add) and decided to show it to me without realizing what  kind of game it was.  Guess what it was?</p>

            <p>Wow, do I feel old…:’(</p>
<p>The first (IBM or clone)PC game I remember playing was Zork. The first computer game I played was a game I wrote on a TRS-80 model III (48k, and had a single sided 120k 5.25 inch floppy drive). The first commercial computer game I played was either Telengard (VIC-20/C-64) or a graphical version of the old Mainframe Star Trek, but I don’t remember what it was called. I do remember that it was on cassette tape… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>The very first I can not quite remember, but it might just have been Age of Empires 2. I got that on a CD along with a bunch of other games someone on my father’s job had downloaded, back before that was actually a crime.<br>
Other games I remember from the same CD (or at least the same time, it’s hard to remember) are Rayman 2, Red Alert 2, Lego Racers 1 and 2 and Frogger 2.</p>
<p>Also, just pointing out the fact that I’m ignoring shitty “educational” “games” and weird Swedish games. Like the one I got for free from a clothing store chain.</p>

<p>Yeah, I did random educational ones like Madeline maths  LOL</p>

            <p>I remember my first computer games being a lot of those shovelware PC games for kids you always see in Target and Staples and such. The first game I really remember playing a lot on PC was the PC port of Virtua Cop 2 (For some reason, it goes by the name Virtua Squad 2 on PC). I remember not having a gun to use, and being annoyed by having to use a mouse. Thus, I wasn’t very good at it, but I definitely played it a lot!</p>

<p>Anyone remember TankWars?</p>

</aside>
<p>Who doesn’t? I loved TankWars. First played it at a friend’s house. Can’t remember if I won any games, but if my memory serves me right, I got my ass romped.</p>

            <p>The first game I actually remember playing I can’t actually remember the name of. It was MS DOS, IIRC, and it was somewhat similar to lode runner…</p>
<p>But the first PC game that I can REMEMBER playing (without a disc) was Hover.<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
The next game I remember playing with a disc was Zoo Tycoon with both expansions. CHRIST I loved that game. Recently got it again (love you, Internet) and it’s just like I remember it. Nostalgia leaking everywhere.</p>
