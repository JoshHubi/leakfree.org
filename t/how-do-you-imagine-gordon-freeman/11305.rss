    <title>How do you imagine Gordon Freeman?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-do-you-imagine-gordon-freeman/11305</link>
    <description>Do you picture him as a hero, a &quot;survive no matter what&quot; type guy, a feeble man etc...?

I&#39;ve always thought of Gordon as just an ordinary man thrown into extraordinary circumstances and eventually becoming a hero.</description>

            <p>Well, as a friend of Gordon Freeman, I can tell you this:</p>
<ol>
<li>He is a mute. We just don’t talk about that in front of him because it makes him sad. He almost had a break-down when Alyx told him that he doesn’t talk much.</li>
<li>He learnt to use weapons because he lived in a very religious part of Seattle where there’s this cult that don’t like mute people.</li>
<li>He was normally a conscientious objector to the whole “anomolous materials” thing, like the rest of the team. We actually hadn’t performed a test to date, and were only acting like we had because there were evaluators coming on that day. We had just made up all the numbers 'till then. (“110%!” Oh, Dr. Kliener, ad-libbing all the way!)</li>
<li>He makes a mean casserole. And I mean mean.</li>
<li>Gordon went on other adventures throughout space and time and parallel, as well as perpendicular universes before ending up in City 17. He has been known during these ventures as names such as (and these are just a few) Boba Fett, The Grouch, Jack the Ripper, Camp Koala (RIP <em>sniff</em>), Morgan Freeman, Al Gore and that one off Breaking Bad.</li>
<li>He is extreemly short sighted.</li>
<li>He does drink a hell of a lot. Started in Munich, I think. He also writes novels under the psuedonym “Dan Brown”.</li>
</ol>

            <p>I imagine him as being shy, but given an unfortunate situation, his will to survive takes over. I also can’t help but think he’d be a great friend to anything that doesn’t want him dead. But, considering he’s whatever the player is, he could well be some annoying prick who only wants to ruin casseroles and destroy boxes.</p>

            <p>Point… Alyx was about 5 during the Black Mesa incident. Gordon was 27… <em>cough</em><br>
All that stasis did was not let Gordon get older, and when he gets out, Alyx is around 25…</p>
<p>I was honestly hoping for a cameo of G-Man entering a portal with a very young, child-looking female person held by hand… You gotta admit that would be cool <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>^ He’s probably doing his best NOT to think of that, because A. he’s trying to save the world and B. technically he’s 20 years older than her, but not because of the G-Man’s stasis.</p>
<p>Apparently the REAL reason the G-Man puts people into stasis is so he can hook them up with total jailbait. If that makes it into Episode Three I fucking called it.</p>

            <p>Given the guy managed to get into MIT and go on to do work overseas I have to say he’s more than your average guy.  He’s obviously smart, and I like to attribute that to his survival and skill somewhat.</p>
<p>I like to think half of it is just him scrambling to make it through things, while the other half of him is analyzing and calculating it all, and there’s this inner-conflict in which his logical mind is overcome by the immense nature of his situation and gives leeway to his “shut up and run and kill stuff” method for figuring things out.</p>

            <p>I imagine Gordon before the incident as an everyday guy who just lives life and does his job and and throughout the course of the story he become more of a hero. I always see Gordon as being modest and not claim to be a hero.</p>

<p>Also, I wouldn’t say he never fired a gun before. HEV-issued scientist go through the Hazard course with it, and firearms training with standart-issue self-defence MP5SD6 (conveniently replacet by HK53 in BM, eh?) is contained in the full package.</p>

            <p>My Gordon has always been an annoying douchebag with ADHD who runs around breaking all your boxes and doesn’t ever bother standing in one place to listen to what you have to say. If the “speaking without the player hearing” thing is to be followed, most of what he says would just be immature insults and telling people to fuck off.</p>

            <p>Gordon Freeman, eh? Well, I wondered what he was like, too… But then I watched Freeman’s Mind and then it all made sense… All made sense… <span class="bbcode-i">[COLOR=‘PaleGreen’]All</span>…</p>

<p>One of the biggest jokes in freeman’s mind is the fact that all these people tell him what he should do, like launching the rocket, but he never listens. When he launches the rocket its seriously a surprise for him, since all he wants to do is escape  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>i think that Freeman is a rather metodic person, that has a great survival instinct and does not know what the heck is happening just finds his way through thanks to his intelligence and the suit(of course). Also he must be a weapons fanatic or something.</p>

</aside>
<p>^pretty much this, that was the reason why ValvE decided to make Gordon as unpersonal as it gets, so no cutscenes involving him and no voice. Everybody projects another character into him. Personally, I don’t like the sarcastic touch of Gordon like in Freeman’s Mind. While I found it funny, I wouldn’t expect Gordon to be such a egoistic and cynical dumbass. If he was, he would have died long time ago, if he wasn’t able to show empathy and care for the people around him, he wouldn’t have gone after Eli (imagine the long way from Sandtraps, through Nova Prospekt and so on) or Alyx in EP2 for that matter.</p>

<p>That’s a pretty epic version of the character. It’s scary.<br>
I myself think he’s sorta like your stereotypical nerd, all quiet and shy, but has some sort of dark side in him. Possibly some psychological issues at an early age. In fact, anyone who’s read his profile in the Half-Life Wiki page knows that he built a tennis ball cannon, which could have been a result of anger management issues. When the RC occurred and he saw what had happened, this dark side pretty much emerged. That quiet and shy scientist was still there, but now there’s rage and bloodlust for all those who’ve hurt him and his coworkers and friends. This can explain why he’s quite unaffected over the fact that he’s killed aliens, who most aren’t in the Black Mesa Facility over choice and are attacking purely out of fear, and soldiers who are only following their orders. But this is all a personal interpretation, and I’m kinda blowing it out of proportion on purpose, lol.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
