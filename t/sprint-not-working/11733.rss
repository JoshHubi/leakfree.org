    <title>Sprint not working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sprint-not-working/11733</link>
    <description>I cannot get sprint to work with shift key or any other key. If I tick the box in options for always run this makes no difference.
I have seen an error in dev console about not being able to write to userconfig but I think this is a red herring.
This is using the latest version of black mesa downloaded 22/11/2012
windows 7 64bit
installed in correct folder under steam apps.

            <p>I think I was running it just seemed slow. The sv_maxspeed was set at 450 the default. I just think that the sprint bind button is not working so as long as I run every where its ok. The game is great and its a little different from the origional.<br>
I used this custom setting<br>

            <p>Maybe there’s a problem with the source files.  All I can suggest, if you haven’t already, is to re-download it from another site or torrent.  Good luck.</p>

            <p>I have manually changed the key for sprint but it does not seem to do anything. I have tried this with the always run box ticked and unticked, it does not seem to make a difference. Its a real shame because the game looks amazing, I bought halflife source hoping it would be something like this. Without being able to run It makes the game impossible to play properly  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>In Options &gt; Black Mesa - Gameplay tab, make sure ‘Enable always run’ is unticked.  Also one thing I initially overlooked was ‘shift’ which was originally set for ‘Sprint’ only applies to the left shift button.  I had to select ‘RShift’ to make this work.</p>
