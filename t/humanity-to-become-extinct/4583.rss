    <title>Humanity to become extinct?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/humanity-to-become-extinct/4583</link>
    <description>Frank Fenner, an expert on the field of extinction, states that there is no hope for humanity. The likelihood of the human race becoming extinct within the next 100 years is very high.

<p>How about growing resistent against antibiotics and vaccines, your body not developing properly and your blood pressure being dangerously low 90% of the time, resulting in heart problems and impotency?</p>
<p>Cause that’s more like the way it actually works.</p>

<p>That same argument applies to the fish flour that they get fed, the anti-biotics and growth hormones and the anti-stress injections the cattle gets just before being slaughtered. It doesn’t just magically disappear. It stays in the meat.</p>
<p>So yes, you are eating nutrients when enjoying a steak. Plus drugs and unhealthy garbage.</p>

<p>Who came up with that joke? We have the worst quality food that exists on the planet. We grow it from bad soil, ship it thousands of miles, spray it with toxic crap to keep insects away. We genetically modify plants that we don’t even fully understand, we put sugars and salts in almost everything. We feed our cattle GM corn instead of grass, pump them full of anti-biotics and growth hormones. Almost all foods in the supermarkets are overprocessed, by the time they reach your mouth there are almost no (if any) nutritions left in it. You will NEVER get all the nutritions you need from eating processed foods. Processed foods are made that way to taste good, not to supply your body with the proper nutritions that it requires to defend itself against diseases.</p>
<p>The healthiest food is that which is grown locally from good soil, eaten within several hours after being harvested.</p>
<p>Developed countries and healthy food, what a joke, it’s estimated that within several decades 1 in 3 people will have type 2 diabetes. At the moment, in several countries, more than half of the population is overweight.</p>

<p>Some overal info if anyone is interested</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s not info, it’s mostly bullshit. In fact, so much of it is bullshit that I don’t even know where to start.</p>
<p>Raw food has been debunked scientifically over and over. Its benefits are almost wholly made-up.</p>
<p>So is the idea that nutrients are somehow diminished by not eating locally or eating genetically modified food. Local food is a good economic and sometimes environmental choice to make. It’s not a nutritional one. In fact, a lot of genetically altered foods have greater nutritional value than their “organic” (what a laugh) counterparts.</p>
<p>If one is to believe your thesis, the majority of America should be suffering from malnutrition, when the U.S. actually has staggeringly LOW malnutrition numbers on a world level. It’s not a lack of nutrients that’s killing first-worlders, it’s an overabundance of fat and cholesterol, and again, as high as the mortality rate from those things is, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to world malnutrition deaths. People like you who spend ten minutes reading some hippie pamphlet on nutrition or watching some youtube documentary actually harm people in poor countries by spreading lies and misinformation about GE crops and modern agriculture. The people you’re getting your (mis)information from are full of shit. Listen to real scientists, not Whole Foods-shopping “nutritionists.”</p>
<p>I could really go on for hours more if you insist though, this is an area I studied extensively before I switched over from premed, and it’s one that’s important to clarify because there’s so much politically charged misinformation out there.</p>

</aside>
<p>Who came up with that joke? We have the worst quality food that exists on the planet. We grow it from bad soil, ship it thousands of miles, spray it with toxic crap to keep insects away. We genetically modify plants that we don’t even fully understand, we put sugars and salts in almost everything. We feed our cattle GM corn instead of grass, pump them full of anti-biotics and growth hormones. Almost all foods in the supermarkets are overprocessed, by the time they reach your mouth there are almost no (if any) nutritions left in it. You will NEVER get all the nutritions you need from eating processed foods. Processed foods are made that way to taste good, not to supply your body with the proper nutritions that it requires to defend itself against diseases.</p>
<p>The healthiest food is that which is grown locally from good soil, eaten within several hours after being harvested.</p>
<p>Developed countries and healthy food, what a joke, it’s estimated that within several decades 1 in 3 people will have type 2 diabetes. At the moment, in several countries, more than half of the population is overweight.</p>

<p>Some overal info if anyone is interested</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ways to Maximize the Nutrient Retention of Your Foods</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">Eat local</span> - The less time your food spends in storage, on the back of a truck or on the shelf, the more nutrients you’re going to conserve. Check your local farmers’ markets and ask where the food is coming from. Favour foods that have travelled under 100 miles.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">Don’t Forget Raw</span> - Eating foods raw is the best way to maximize how many nutrients are left intact. Salads are something that can be eaten daily as part of a meal, or as the meal itself. Smoothies are another way to get a good dose of raw foods. The blending of the food does expose it to oxygen, therefore destroying some of the nutrients, but the majority of the nutrient content is still intact.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">Cook Lightly</span> - The longer a food is exposed to heat, the more nutrient loss there is. Cook vegetables lightly, so that they’re still crisp and colourful. Steam rather than boil, if you can. Fish should only be cooked to medium to preserve essential fats. Garnish long-cooked stews or soups with raw and fermented veggies to add important enzymes and nutrients.</p>
<p>Ferment - Unlike other food preparations, lactofermentation actually increases the nutrient content of foods. The process of the bacteria breaking down the foods adds vitamins, enzymes and more probiotic bacteria. Fermented foods sold in the grocery store have been pasteurized, however, killing these enzymes and beneficial bacteria, but home fermented foods are extremely nutrient-dense.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">Skip the Processed Convenience Foods</span> - Canned, boxed or pre-cooked foods are going to have the least nutrients left intact. The more processing (i.e., the less it looks like the original food) the less nutrients are retained. Frozen or dried foods are better, but fresh is best. Some processed foods have vitamins added back in, but this is a far inferior approach to eating than getting the naturally occurring nutrients from the original food.</p>
<p>Some nutrients are remarkably resistant to cooking or processing. The anthocyanins, pigment phytonutrients found in fruits and veggies (like purple potatoes) seem to be affected very little by heat. Others, though, are quite fragile, like the essential fatty acids, which begin to oxidize instantly on exposure to air.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]But the important thing is not to obsess over nutrient loss. Yes, some nutrients are lost in the cooking of your foods, but this isn’t the end of the world. As long as you’re eating fresh ingredients, lightly cooked or carefully prepared, you’re still getting a significant nutrient profile from your foods.</p>

<p>Some people even go as far as to say that more than 90% of all food in the supermarketd is not healthy. Foods are sprayed with toxic materials, genetically modified, filled with conservatives, too much salts and sugars, too much junk like hydrogenated oils (trans fat) and high-fructose corn syrup, ‘fast meals’ and so on.</p>
<p>And I’m not just talking about junkfood, it’s almost everything from canned foods to bread, all candy and ESPECIALY softdrinks (Coca Cola for example).</p>
<p>The effects it has on health and the environment is dramatic.</p>
