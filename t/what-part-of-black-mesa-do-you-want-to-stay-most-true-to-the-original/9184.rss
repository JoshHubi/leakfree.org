    <title>What part of Black Mesa do you want to stay most true to the original!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-part-of-black-mesa-do-you-want-to-stay-most-true-to-the-original/9184</link>
    <description>I have been looking at this mod since its beginning and bought the PCGAMER magazine with the original article explaining the premise of this mod! Since then I have been poking in and out of this forum and have been wondering what people are most looking forward to staying exactly the same with little change to the original. And what would you have liked to see changed completely or is there a big feature you would want to see implemented that would never be available in this mod, your choice!</description>

            <p>The sound of the 9mm. I mean, all the weapons sounds really but the 9mm is most important. IMO it;s the most badass pistol sound in any game I ever played.<br>
There is probably material out there to see how it is but I refrained from watching any material lately to avoid spoilers, etc. Still, I hope they kept the sounds as much/close as possible.</p>

            <p>I actually hope there’s a lot of new passages and different ways to get from point A to point B. One of the best things about the original was that you could watch videos of someone else play after you had beaten the game ten times and still see something that you didn’t know about.</p>
<p>I am excited to play the game normal the first few times and then start trying to speed run it and find all kinds of crazy shortcuts and glitches etc. exploring every aspect of the mod.</p>

            <p>I hope they keep some of the iconic lines exactly how they were in the original.  “Why do we all have to wear these <span class="bbcode-i">ridiculous</span> ties?”  “Science team…you think he was responsible; sabotage, maybe?”,  “So, where are we taking this Freeman guy?”, “I didn’t sign on for this shit.  Monsters, sure, but civilians?”, and so on.</p>
<p>Other lines are fine to be added, but I hope these lines from the original are in.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I mean, I did have an idea of remastering all the HL1 weapon sounds, and maybe even re-scoring the original music to match the timing of the new tracks. The thing is, if I do that, I’m going to wait until there’s been enough time for most people to have put at least two playthroughs into the mod.</p>

<p>I don’t understand why some of you want to replace the new sounds with the original ones. First of all, I know almost all of you won’t even bother doing that when it comes out. Would you seriously, before even playing the game, replace the sound files? That just sounds completely asinine.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s something you’d do on a second playthrough…maybe.</p>
<p>Back on topic though, stuff like the zombie in the chair having a seizure at the computer screen, all of the G-man appearances, zombie pulling security guard into vent, scientist diving through glass window, alien grunt throwing soldier through concrete wall, etc.</p>
