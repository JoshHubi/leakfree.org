    <title>Scripted dialogue, scenes, and progression not working, also a visual bug.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/scripted-dialogue-scenes-and-progression-not-working-also-a-visual-bug/13996</link>
    <description>On the level Power Up, as I powered up the rail and returned to the wounded security guard (before killing the first Gargantuan), he doesn&#39;t say any of his lines, only walks over to the console where he waits for you to go to the rail. interacting with him does nothing, he doesn&#39;t say anything.
Then on the level Apprehension, when you come to the first Icthyosaur, and climb up to meet the scientist who&#39;s supposed to tell you about the crossbow inside the cage, he doesn&#39;t say anything. Also interacting yields no results, he simply stands there.
As I killed the Icthyosaur, I tried to go to the door in that room from which to progress (labeled something like 2-B or 2-D, apologies for fuzzy memories), it does not unlock.

I&#39;m going to try to reload that specific map and see if the problems occur again or if it was simply a fluke.

Finally a minor visual bug, the Noise Shader in the Black Mesa settings, which I&#39;m guessing is supposed to apply a stronger film grain filter the closer you are to radioactive materials, well, for me it just makes the screen very dark, so dark that raising the brightness does nothing and the flashlight is of no use.
Might be something in my autoexec.cfg, or my hardware, so here&#39;s a list of my hardware and attached is my autoexec.cfg
Obviously it is a minor bug, I can safely disable it in the menu and play the game happily ever after.

            <p>I used the console to go to the level with the first icthyosaur, gave myself and godmode and noclipped to the bottom of the ladder that takes you up to the door and the scientist. I climbed the ladder and opened the door and he said his lines normally without me interacting with him. Didn’t test the problem with the wounded guard in power up but I’d think its the same type issue.<br>
The only parts of your autoexec i changed were removing the threaded/queued lines and I lowered the mem max heap to 2048.</p>
<p>My guess is it’s probably needing a reinstall, unless you modified some other scripts or something. Good luck getting it working correctly.</p>

            <p>I have the Steam Standalone Early Access version. And that autoexec I’m using with my version of Black Mesa, looks a bit different than the one I used back when I played through the mod 2012 version. (different engine, different commands available and/or disabled.)<br>
You should consider editing some lines in my autoexec to suit your own computer a bit, because stuff like the datacachesize, mem_min/max_heapsizes, those numbers I based upon how much RAM, VRAM and virtual memory I have available on my computer. And the different “threaded” and “queued” lines are enabled because of my quad core processor.<br>
Just played again through killing the first Icthyosaur and the door still did not open. In the end I simply got frustrated and noclipped through that door.</p>

            <p>Not sure but I wonder if any of the lines like mem_min_heapsize “128” or mod_forcedata “1” could cause it.</p>
<p>Is this on the mod version or steam version? if it’s the steam version i’ll try using your autoexec and see if I get the same problems.</p>
<p>edit: derp, forgot I still have the mod version installed too so I’ll try it with both.</p>
<p>edit 2: nevermind, the mod version loads the main menu then crashes when i click. I’m guessing it’s trying to get data from the steam version or something and breaking itself.</p>
