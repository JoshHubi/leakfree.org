    <description>The Cafeteria in We&#39;ve got hostiles floor is just too shiny I can see the screens and lights in the floor and it looks bad this room. the reflections look as though they are rendering under the floor too.

Another room that is a lighting issue is the warehouse in surface tension just before the dam is too dark and the generators models only draw when you shine a flashlight on them</description>
