    <title>Graphics blur in Java GUI and Planescape: Torment</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/graphics-blur-in-java-gui-and-planescape-torment/7384</link>
    <description>For some odd reasons, both Java GUI and Planescape: Torment menus have this strange issue where they initially render how they should, and then gradually just get these &quot;blur&quot; across them that makes them completely unusable:

Here&#39;s a Java GUI:

and here&#39;s Planescape: Torment:

I thought it was a Java issue until I purchased Planescape: Torment recently, so now I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s something else. Any ideas what could be causing this?</description>

<p>You’ve totally saved my bacon. I’ve been looking for a fix for this problem for weeks, and the filtering was the fix. Thanks for posting, I’m going to mention it on <a href="http://GOG.com" rel="nofollow noopener">GOG.com</a>, too!</p>

            <p>I’ve tried that.</p>
<p>Then again, I may have been doing it wrong. It’s extremely difficult to do when the Java Control Panel is also blurring…</p>
<p>I’ll try again.</p>
<p>Edit: Yep, I type it in and press “Ok” and don’t notice any difference. Also, when I go back into the Runtime Enviroment Settings the input line isn’t there, like it isn’t saving the settings.</p>
<p>Update: Ok, I disabled my graphics drivers and using whatever the default drivers are appears to properly display Java, so clearly it is a hardware issue.</p>
<p>Double Update: Re-enabled and that doesn’t seem to have helped. Also, it seems the drivers have disabled the ability to use the Windows control panel to disable all hardware acceleration…</p>
<p>Triple Update: Figured out why the settings weren’t saving, I was being an idiot. That didn’t fix the Java issue. I was able to fix the Planescape: Torment issue with the Microsoft Compatibility Tool and Emulating DirectDraw or whatever.</p>
<p>Final Update: Found it. Morphological Filtering was causing the problem.</p>
