    <description>For those of you who don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve been tracking this [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/underhell&#39;]mod[/url] for a while now, while the prologue was &quot;meh&quot; when it was first released, the latest [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkhBvLxutLU&amp;feature=player_embedded&#39;]Chapter 1 feature[/url] [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkhBvLxutLU&amp;feature=player_embedded&#39;]showcases[/url] make it look pretty fucking unique. 

When I first played the mod, nothing really stood out to me at the time (it&#39;s the original prologue, although that&#39;s significantly outdated at this point). Most of the horror aspect of the mod was inside of the house, and the action was rather stale. The new showcases make it look pretty fucking epic, thoughts on the mod?</description>

            <p>Yeah, I didn’t expect the mod would be turn out to that special and unique.</p>
<p>You want action? Play the prison part. You want horror? Play the house</p>
