    <title>Nihilanth&#39;s Teleport question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/nihilanths-teleport-question/62714</link>
    <description>So i just saw some videos on Youtube of Nihilanth battle and i have noticed that he doesn&#39;t Teleport the player. Will y&#39;all be adding that into the game in a later update? If so might i suggest that you add his Teleports to the Hardest Difficulty and remove the ammo stashes from his main chamber and add those ammo stashes to the places he Teleports you to. Giving us players who like a challenge a bigger challenge.</description>
