    <description>What are some games you expected to be bad, but came out contrary to your conception, and vice-versa

I&#39;ll start. 

Castlevainia Lords of Shadow.
TBH I thought that it would suck, due to the demo. But after playing the retail version it was awesome, one of the best games i&#39;ve ever played.

Halo: ODST
I thought this game would be great, but the campaign felt like Bungie gave up on it. It was so dull insignificant and boring, who wants to play a bunch of flashbacks for a campaign?</description>

            <p>I expected that I wouldn’t like mass effect 2 since I’m not really into the whole scifi thing, but it’s actually an awesome game.</p>
<p>I never got what was so special about fallout 3. I tried to like it, but I just got bored.</p>

            <p>I thought Mafia 2 would be fun, and it was but I felt there wasnt much outside the story line which I thought was short and had an expected ending.</p>
<p>Black and White 2, I thought it would be fun like the first, but it is way way better than I expected. It is easily one of my favorite games of all time.</p>

<p>Well… with a game like Crysis 1… You’d naturally think Crysis 2 would be better… But… unfortunately, it’s the opposite.</p>
<p>Team Fortress 2 is… or was an amazing game when it came out…</p>
<p>Now with all the bs (customization) that it’s filled with, it’s no longer amazing to me.</p>

<p>I thought Reach was going to be bonertown, but it was only half as good as I was yearning for, a real step down from the exhilaration I experienced during the multiplayer beta.</p>

            <p>I’m not going to go with the complete “Dragon Age 2 was rubbish” thing, but in the spirit of this thread, Dragon Age: Origins was better than I was expecting while Dragon Age 2 was not as good as I was expecting. For a lot of the changes, I can see why Bioware made them, even if they didn’t really make the game much better, but what really killed it for me was the environments.</p>
<p>Opening near Lothering, where everything has been green at the start of the first game but now everything was brown, probably less than 2 weeks later in game-world time, was not good. Kirkwall looked quite interesting when I arrived with the grand architecture, which just developed into very plain areas, all the same colour of stone or that yellow dirt/mud colour in the slums. Some areas looked good, like the Deep Roads or the coastal area, but that only showed up just how bad the rest of the game areas looked. Seeing the areas look so much less real and unique than the first game really broke the sense of immersion for me, and ultimately spoiled the rest of the game for me.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Dragon Age 1 = beautiful world and so believable, Dragon Age 2 = ugly world and so didn’t seem real at all.</p>

            <p>There are, but most of the reviews I encounter are still “(insert random bitching about how there should only be one console here)”. Why does everyone complain about the AI though? I haven’t run into any problems with it, but that’s probably just me. As for the story, what ISN’T cliché these days? Everything has been done at least twice at this point.</p>

            <p>Too Human. I thought it was going to suck because of all the horrible reviews I read, but I wound up having a lot of fun with it. That said, there are a handful of things that need to be fixed when they release Too Human: Rise of the Giants, such as a bit more Norse mythology and a lot less items. The item system was honestly overwhelming. In the next game I wouldn’t mind it if they just gave you a a few different weapons to choose from and one set of armor that you can upgrade and change as you go through the game. Also, the structure of the campaign needs to be changed quite a bit. I loved how massive the levels felt, but they began to drag on after a while. Baldur should also feel a lot more god-like than he did in the first game.</p>

            <p>To add to the list,</p>
<p>Mirrors Edge was a game I really enjoyed… I seem to do really well with jumping puzzles. It was also an amazing game as it kind removed the limits that you see in alot of games (being able to hang from pipes, shimming beside a generator in a hall etc) plus some of the physics in the game were absolutly breath taking (scene with the elevator glass smashing! The tarps on the scaffolds)</p>
<p>Given I got Mirrors edge on the cheap from Steam I guess I was feeling kinda ballsy and ended up purchasing Alpha Prime I kind of wasn’t expecting alot, and despite it looking pretty ok and what not it was kind of unplayable. I don’t think I’m a super awesome terminator in FPS’s but I do play alot of them and I don’t really die to often, I mean there is usually a balance you try to attain and this didn’t seem to have it. I dunno I just couldn’t get into it. maybe I’ll go back and try again  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I really hoped Crackdown and it’s sequel would be good, but both of them crushed my hopes.</p>
<p>Also, I thought League of Legends would be bad, I also judged it by it’s graphics, disliked the cell-shaded look. It grew on me, and I love the game, how can you not love it if it’s based on Dota?</p>

            <p>Terraria and Minecraft.</p>
<p>I judged them because of the graphics, but they are frigging time consuming. Unbelievable.</p>

            <p>HEY!!! Who remembers the year half life came out… LOL not half life sIn… man that was a downer… Bug city!!! WAs hyped soooo much and then it was just crap!!!</p>
<p>Also, a couple gooders that never really seemed to catch on at the time were Rise of the Triad and CyberMage. I remember PC Gamer gave CyberMage a wopping 98% but a month later I found it in a bargain bin for like ten bucks… best ten bucks I ever spent. Some of it was kinda campy in the whole tigerman thing but it was pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Heretic II was a bit of a let down as well.</p>

            <p>Turok was pretty good aside from how shitty the mouse movement was, but the story and graphics were actually pretty good.</p>
<p>Also, right when Fallout 3 came out it was a big maybe for me when i was deciding whether or not to purchase it, but it actually turned out to be the best game i have ever played</p>
