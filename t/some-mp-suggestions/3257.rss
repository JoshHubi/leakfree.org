    <title>Some MP Suggestions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-mp-suggestions/3257</link>
    <description>Okay, here I am, hoping this was not discussed earlier: a few thoughts about MP part of BMS.
[b]First[/b] of all, it would be nice if cfgs will be backward-compatible with HLDM (I mean there would be no trouble re-writing all these aliases, binds etc. Just copy/paste.)
[b]Second[/b] thing is movement. It&#39;s really ugly in HL2 and Source-based games (from my point of HLDM and AGmod player  :smiley: ). More speed, more air-control and normal bunnyhop (not HL2DM-style)  :slight_smile: 
It leads me to [b]third[/b] thing: no props on MP maps please! When you are high-speed bhoping around map from enraged player and being stuck in small props (coffee cups for example), it really sucks, beleive me  :smiley: 

Okay for now, later I&#39;m going to add some more thoughts.

Upd: oh yea, &#39;bout mp maps: please leave old-good tricks on &#39;em (ex. various strafe-jumps, crate bhops on stalkyard, strafe-jump rpg pickup on rapidcore and gauss-jump to the window from longjump/egon/hev charger room on crossfire)</description>

            <p>The one thing I can agree on is no props unless they’re tied to the map specifically. they have no purpose unless the gravity gun is available, which is not supposed to be the case for Black Mesa.</p>

<p>Your suggestions could be summarised to “make Black Mesa deathmatch identical to Half-Life Deathmatch”.</p>
<p>That isn’t what this project is about. We’re rebuilding Half-Life from the ground up, the way we think Valve would have done it if they’d been using the Source engine at the time. It’s not a perfect port of Half-Life; that’d be boring, and really wouldn’t do the game justice. <span class="bbcode-b">At the end of the day, Half-Life and Black Mesa are going to be two different games.</span></p>

            <p>Rocket jumps do increase speed however the reprocussion in doing so is health. When done perfectly the loss of health is pretty marginal, but still a loss nonetheless. I’d say it’s a technique more than anything.</p>
<p>Bunnyhopping is not a natural evolution of HL gameplay that would naturally happen, it only exists because someone discovered a way to exploit the game engine.</p>
<p>You can’t justify the means just for the gameplay ends. It’s a terrible unintuitive exploit of the game engine that won’t bring any new players to the game, because it’s full of people doing stupid things like bunny hopping to get silly advantages.</p>
<p>Play the game not the engine.</p>

<p>From the perspective of single player, they were exploits.<br>
Like rocket jumping in quake before it, they allow people to effectively cheat the game.<br>
In multiplayer they don’t really count as exploits because everyone can do them.  But they were a bug.</p>

            <p>This thread brings a tear to my eye. Heck, between the username of “noob” and the type of questions being asked (make cfg files backwards compatible? How would the devs know what binds and aliases you’re using?) and the fact that a lot of this was addressed in the wiki, I almost wanted to get out the flamethrower myself. I was sure this was going to go down in flames from response one.</p>
<p>But no. Angdraug just pulled out a quick jibe that lacked any type of offensive content, and Hyperbyte followed up with just pointing noob where he could find the info, and now there’s already a mod who can lock things down if people start getting out of hand (and is known for actually doing so)</p>
<p>I’m not even joking, I’m so proud right now.</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>You can find lots of information on the <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Black Mesa Wiki</a>.  There’s also a comprehensive <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Single-player_FAQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">FAQ</a> on there, which states:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I found this bug in the original Half-Life, will it be removed in Black Mesa?</span><br>
As we are rebuilding Half-Life from the ground up, it will be highly unlikely that the same bugs will appear. We will also be rigorously testing Black Mesa before it is released, to remove any bugs that we inadvertently create. This includes exploits like bunny-hopping.</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Okay, here I am, hoping this was not discussed earlier: a few thoughts about MP part of BMS.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">First</span> of all, it would be nice if cfgs will be backward-compatible with HLDM (I mean there would be no trouble re-writing all these aliases, binds etc. Just copy/paste.)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Second</span> thing is movement. It’s really ugly in HL2 and Source-based games (from my point of HLDM and AGmod player  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ). More speed, more air-control and normal bunnyhop (not HL2DM-style)  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
It leads me to <span class="bbcode-b">third</span> thing: no props on MP maps please! When you are high-speed bhoping around map from enraged player and being stuck in small props (coffee cups for example), it really sucks, beleive me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Okay for now, later I’m going to add some more thoughts.</p>
<p>Upd: oh yea, 'bout mp maps: please leave old-good tricks on 'em (ex. various strafe-jumps, crate bhops on stalkyard, strafe-jump rpg pickup on rapidcore and gauss-jump to the window from longjump/egon/hev charger room on crossfire)</p>
