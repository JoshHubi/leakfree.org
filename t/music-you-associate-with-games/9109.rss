    <title>Music you associate with Games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/music-you-associate-with-games/9109</link>
    <description>Let me explain a little better...

I just had my music on random and the song &#39;So Long Scarecrow&#39; by Scarling came on.  Into my head popped the memory of running through Zangarmarsh in WoW:TBC.
I bought that album way back when the first WoW expansion came out and I must have played it a few times when grinding Zangar for the first time.  So now the album gives me mental images of Zangarmarsh.  Whenever I hear songs by that band I immediately think back to playing TBC.

Another example would be Gorillaz.  There are a few songs from the first album which make me think of the old Lionhead game Black &amp; White.  I used to play B&amp;W with Gorillaz in the background.

Finally, whenever I hear certain Dillinger Escape Plan songs I think of the original Dawn of War.

So, are there any songs which you now associate with particular games?</description>

<p>With Prince of Persia: Warrior Within.<br>
Everytime I hear the song I can’t help thinking “I’m sure I heard this sons while playing PoP:WW”. This just brings to my mind the atmosphere of the Island of Time in the past, where everything is ruined, dark and decadent. I think that’s because the game had a very similar soundtrack, with the same kind of sound. The sound of the guitar and the synthetizers of the back are really similar to the sound of the PoP:WW soundtrack.</p>

<p>That album is easily one of the greatest album to ever exist – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6j2kPjTFk4&amp;hd=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">so</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTSH6QKQhf8&amp;hd=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fFI2fkbFZs&amp;hd=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">golden</span></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-62a3_0Nj_Y&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">tracks</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8y2VxKGyw" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">I associate this song with battlefield Bad Company 2.</a></p>
<p>Why? I was listening through the band’s music while playing. There was this fucknut in a helicopter destroying our team, and all the assholes on are end were playing as medics and no one was trying to shoot him down. A friend on skype who was playing, said “I got this” and a few seconds after I heard these words, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J8y2VxKGyw&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=146s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the helicopter smashed right in front of me as I was running forwards at this point in the music.</a></p>
<p>From then on, we started to pick up our losses and take the game back. The song was the perfect fucking score for that moment.</p>

            <p>I remember way back when I was a kid I played the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZvaVgmIUrc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Quake Rally</a> racing mod, and they used random instrumental song bits for their OST (since back then nobody made their own music for mods)</p>
<p>but I didn’t know that, so several years later my mom was watching HGTV, and I hear one of the songs used in Quake Rally in the background and I’m thinking, “HOLY SHIT, THEY USED A SONG FROM A QUAKE MOD!!” like an idiot.</p>
<p>You know, thinking about it, Halo’s vehicles drive almost exactly the same as quake rally’s, albeit with much better physics. Maybe bungie took some inspiration from it?</p>

            <p>Songs that I associate with games? Well:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Ds6t7dO68" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Aces High by Arch Enemy</a> reminds me of Battlefield 3.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qibx62koZr8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">14 Ghosts II</a> ALWAYS reminds me of fighting my way through Agropom in STALKER. Frankly, the entire album sounds like STALKER to me.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4XHcZR0cjY" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Royal Crown Avenue’s Hey Pachuco</a> brings nice memories from vanilla Team Fortress 2.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrhZs6M5Z3w" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Rhubarb</a> reminds me of the strangely soothing pixelated plains of Minecraft.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dKRKDn9ZJk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This nice track</a> always makes me think of Seiken Densetsu 3, a rather obscure Super Famicom game.<br>
And finally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw8PpYBiDsc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> always reminds me of City 17 (the song that is).</p>
<p>I could go on, but I have to eat.<br>
Also, on an unrelated note, does someone know what the hell is a fingerbib?</p>

            <p>A while back I modded my Red Alert 2 game with quite a few music tracks, including Linkin Park, Korn and P.O.D. (Selectable from the game menu)</p>
<p>I don’t listen to any of those bands anymore, plus RA2 doesn’t work on my new PC. I think I must have been a moron anyways because the RA2 soundtrack is really quite good.</p>

            <p>In GTA: Vice City I had all kinds of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8_z6TOZq-k" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Bad English</a> music on the mp3 station. Man, I’d actually want to play it again with that music. Had some memorable car chases with that music.</p>
<p>When playing HL:Opposing multiplayer I have a variety of other old music, like the Babys, Journey and Steve Perry. Yes, you read that one right, Steve Perry, old and less old… Can’t explain, it’s the feeling I get.</p>

            <p>I used to listen to Disturbed and Linkin Park when playing Dreamcast games.  I don’t listen to Linkin Park anymore.  Or play Dreamcast games.</p>
<p>I wish my Dreamcast still worked  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
(I should check and see if the emulator I tried has improved any since the version I tested)</p>

            <p>I used to play Anarchy Online while listening to Trentemøller and Dubstep.FM which plays old school Dubstep like Distance. So whenever I think of one I instantly associate it with the other.</p>

I was playing Vindictus, and we were waiting for more people to join the raid to kill the giant bear boss. Started chatting, someone decided we needed some theme music for this fight. EotT seemed like the logical choice.</p>
