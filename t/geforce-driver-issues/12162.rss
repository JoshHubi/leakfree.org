    <title>GeForce Driver Issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/geforce-driver-issues/12162</link>
    <description>So the other day I updated my drivers, hoping to get at least slightly better performance since apparently I was using the 2010 driver. My games now have slightly worse performance than they did before.

Some specific examples:
Half-Life 2 - Every time the suppression device fires, I get unplayable amounts of lag/stutter until all those particles are gone. This used to be perfectly fine.
Resident Evil 3: Nemesis - There are lines all across the screen. Normally disabling texture correction would fix this, it doesn&#39;t anymore.
Halo - All saves mysteriously erased, may or may not be the driver&#39;s fault.
Just Cause 2 - The whole screen is forced into a box on launch.

Is there a solution of some kind, or will I just have to see if the next update is any better? By the way, I&#39;m using a GeForce 9100M G.</description>

<p>the new drivers could have changed the 3d rendering settings to more gpu-intensive ones, try setting textures and other stuff to “performance” and make sure vsync is off.</p>

<p>Thanks, it’s fine now!</p>

            <p>Did you uninstall the drivers before installing? Usually that’s not necessary, but it <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> cause problems if you don’t. Worth a try.</p>
