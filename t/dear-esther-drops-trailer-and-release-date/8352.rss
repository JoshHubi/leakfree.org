<p>Anyone want to inform me on the plot in this game? Can’t seem to find a decent link to an outline.</p>
<p>I watched the play-throughs of the original and can’t really grasp the incoherence – seems quite elegant.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You want spoilers?  Okay, here’s the very general, non-spoily version:</p>
<p>[color=black]You are exploring an island alone.  The readings you hear are readings from the journal of a dead man, narrated in his voice, which you have along with you.  Each one begins, “Dear Esther…” (well… nearly all of them).  The man talks at length about Donnelly, an explorer who came to the shores of the island years before, and Jakobson, a shepherd who at one point lived on the island.  It’s unclear what the significance of the island itself is.  By the end of the game, you end up following the same path across the island that the man in the journal did, and the entries in the journal give you a very general view of the part of the story that’s rooted firmly in reality.</p>
<p>And here’s the super-spoily version:</p>
<p>[color=black]Esther Donnelly was the man in the journal’s wife.  She was killed in a car crash on the M-5 by a drunk driver named Paul Jakobson.  This next bit is my own personal interpretation, as a lot of the significance of the island and the narration is left intentionally ambiguous.  In his grief, the Donnelly of the journal discovered Donnelly the explorer’s account of the island, and drew heavily on the parallels the island’s history held with the catastrophe that had killed his wife.  He travelled to the island himself, already half-mad with grief, and began decorating it as a tribute to his Esther.  He took to heart the stories of a hermit who had lived in the caves beneath the island, and the mystical connotations the caverns had, and attempted to descend the cliffs to the caves himself, but fell and broke his femur on the way down.  He had brought with him a first aid kit, and dosed himself heavily on painkillers to keep himself going.  Stricken with despair and barely lucid with all the drugs running through his system, he emerged from the other side of the caves and began climbing.  First, though, he tore all of the pages from his journal - all of the letters he wrote to Esther after her death - and folded them into paper boats.  He folded her ashes into the creases, and set the boats to sea.  He then climbed this new side of the island, decorating as he went, until he reached the aerial at the island’s highest point.  He flung himself from the cliff and plunged to the island below, rejoining Esther in death.  Your identity remains ambiguous, but I’ve figured that either your identity is not important - you’re just a nameless non-entity playing witness to all that had happened - or you’re Donnelly, replaying the events of his stay on the island as he plummets to his death.</p>

<p>pretty sure the synopsis is on the main page of the website.</p>
<p>but for your pleasure.</p>
<p>A deserted island… a lost man… memories of a fatal crash… a book written by a dying explorer.</p>

[i]Dear Esther is a ghost story told using first-person gaming technologies. Rather than traditional gameplay, the focus here is on exploration, uncovering the mystery of the island, of who you are and why you are here. Fragments of story are randomly triggered by moving around the environments, making every telling unique. Features a stunning, specially commissioned soundtrack. Forget the normal rules of play; if nothing seems real here, it’s because it may just be all a delusion.</p>
<p>What is the significance of the aerial - What happened on the motorway - is the island real or imagined - who is Esther and why has she chosen to summon you here?</p>
<p>The answers are out there, on the lost beach and the tunnels under the island. Or then again, they may just not be, after all…[/i]</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fileplanet.com/196430/190000/fileinfo/Half-Life-2---Dear-Esther-Mod-v1.1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.fileplanet.com/196430/190000/fileinfo/Half-Life-2—Dear-Esther-Mod-v1.1</a><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Dear Esther is part of a research project, creating experimental game mods, based at the University of Portsmouth, UK. The aim was to use Source to create something radically different from normal: an interactive story that dispensed with traditional gameplay and focused instead on an open-ended, semi-random narrative.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for that, but it still leaves me questioning what parts of those stories he is talking about. Are they all connected? He narrates all of the stories and I can never tell which one he is talking about.</p>
<p>Oh well, maybe a second play through when it comes out will refresh me.</p>

            <p>Why? Have you played the original mod? The whole thing is about isolation and loneliness, and having creatures or other people in the mod would take away from that.</p>

<p>pretty sure the synopsis is on the main page of the website.</p>
<p>but for your pleasure.</p>
<p>A deserted island… a lost man… memories of a fatal crash… a book written by a dying explorer.</p>

[i]Dear Esther is a ghost story told using first-person gaming technologies. Rather than traditional gameplay, the focus here is on exploration, uncovering the mystery of the island, of who you are and why you are here. Fragments of story are randomly triggered by moving around the environments, making every telling unique. Features a stunning, specially commissioned soundtrack. Forget the normal rules of play; if nothing seems real here, it’s because it may just be all a delusion.</p>
<p>What is the significance of the aerial - What happened on the motorway - is the island real or imagined - who is Esther and why has she chosen to summon you here?</p>
<p>The answers are out there, on the lost beach and the tunnels under the island. Or then again, they may just not be, after all…[/i]</p>

<span class="bbcode-i">Dear Esther is part of a research project, creating experimental game mods, based at the University of Portsmouth, UK. The aim was to use Source to create something radically different from normal: an interactive story that dispensed with traditional gameplay and focused instead on an open-ended, semi-random narrative.</span></p>

            <p>Trailer is extremely beautiful but that release date has been known for more than a month  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Valentine’s Day seems to be a good choice for this kind of game.</p>
