    <title>[Crash] freezer on map c1a2c</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-freezer-on-map-c1a2c/9976</link>
    <description>Evening,

I&#39;ve experienced two crashes on map c1a2c while inside the freezer area, both standing in different positions.

The first crash occured when a head crab jumped towards me and landed on my head. As soon as I looked up I CTD&#39;d.

The second crash occurred in a different room within the freezer, the room with a dead scientist and security officer zombie. I nealt down to admire the model ( :smiley: ); as soon as I turned around I CTD&#39;d.

Both crashes yielded a message: Too many verts for a dynamic vertex buffer (32974&gt;32768 ). Tell a programmer to up VERTEX BUFFER SIZE&quot;.

The above message appeared during the second crash, which only seems to occur when i get extremely close to the blue closed doorway and turn around quickly.

I have attached both crash dumps.

Thanks againf or this fantastic game, i&#39;m really enjoying it  :smiley:
