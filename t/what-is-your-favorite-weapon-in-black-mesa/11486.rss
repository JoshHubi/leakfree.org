            <p>The Crossbow because when I use it I feel like Rambo. And the MP5 because it’s got the grenade launcher that makes me feel like Tony Montana.</p>

            <p>I didn’t like the MP5 at first, but after my second playthrough I found it really handy and spammable. It’s not THE best weapon imo, but it can be used in almost every situation.<br>
Other than that, magnum is satisfying as hell when you land headshots, and the SPAS-12 sounds and feels good. The range is freakin long on that gun though xD</p>

            <p>Overall? That’s a hard one…</p>
<p>Honestly I’d probably say either the shotgun/SPAS_12 or the crossbow (I love sniping). It just sucks they removed the crossbows ability to pin stuff to objects. That was so fun. :C</p>
<p>I didn’t use the hivehand much at all on my 1st run, because I didn’t know how too properly. On my second run through I chose not too just because as annoyingly hard as the game can be sometimes, the HH makes things too easy/boring.</p>
<p>Also just a question for people since there isn’t really any other thread to ask.<br>
When/how do you choose between using the gluon gun and TAU cannon?<br>
I never know how to use them properly (I use the TAU on the first Apache encounter and also the second, but once I get the gluon I rarely used it).</p>

            <p>Returning to this thread after having played BM several times through, I’d have to change my vote to the Hivehand (once you get it).  Though I may have exploited it just a tad.  When I got to the second area with the assassins, I just stood in the entryway of the room and launched a couple dozen hornets into the room and waited until I didn’t see them veer off anymore, then I strafed back and forth along the left/back side of the room launching hornets into the air until I didn’t see them veer off anymore.  Bam, no more assassins, and I didn’t lose a single HP.</p>
<p>Also, while waiting for the teleporter in the Lamba Core to power up and the orb to Xen to appear to complete the current portion of the game, the Hivehand came in super handy.  Strafe and hornets.  I got hit once by the controller’s energy orbs (whatever they are) during my last playthrough, and just booked it passed the Agrunts that appeared when the teleportation orb opened.</p>
<p>Before the hivehand, however, my vote is still on the SPAS-12.</p>

<p>However it eats up ammunition like mad. I tried using it at lambda core after I figured out that there are pletly ammunition for it, but I ended up using it too fast and couldn<code>t find that much ammo anymore.  Was low on ammo for other guns as well, so I don</code>t think it`s a problem. At least on hard difficulty. x)</p>
<p>Anyway I like gluon gun as well, it was my favourite hl weapon when I was n00b, however it`s OP and not very challenging to use. But what was truly challenging was fps in final room,  so Gluon gun really came handy as way to clear out room despite having terrible lags.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Anyway, after finally completing this game, my favourite weapon turned out to be same gluon. Hivehand as my second favourite, because it`s very useful as well.</p>

<p>Magnum is my “Ol’ reliable,” whenever I am unsure about an area I whip it out.  It is a great all-purpose gun.  I also actually like the MP5, it is a great gun once you get used to using it.  Tau is also pretty awesome, it has great accuracy and can be mighty powerful with a charge.</p>
<p>As far as the funnest gun though, the Gluon gun has no competition.  Holy shit, the first time I used that gun it was like christmas morning.  Explody enemies are so much fun.</p>

            <p>The hivehand.  Maybe just for its introductory sequence ( <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ) but also because it feels more powerful than the original, which I think fits well with its place in the story.</p>
