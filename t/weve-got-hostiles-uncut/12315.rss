    <description>EDIT: .RK has taken over execution of the idea. This thread will now be used for brainstorming suggestions, rather than tracking the development progress.
Okay guys. Here&#39;s the deal: As you may know, the vent maze in [i]&quot;We&#39;ve Got Hostiles!&quot;[/i] was cut out. I have a plan: put the vent maze back in, but fix its shortcomings. However, I&#39;ll need your help, as I also want to learn Hammer usage along the way.</description>

<p>I don’t think that Open Source Forever has given up on his mod. His “Sorry this project has been dead” comment actually refers to his lack of activity in developing the mod, due to other gaming related and personal activities. He is in the process of getting the .vmf file that .RK created, so I think he is still pursuing completion of his mod.</p>
<p>Maybe you could clarify this matter for us Open Source Forever.</p>

            <p>UPDATE: Sorry this project has been dead. I got a copy of <span class="bbcode-i">Portal 2</span> in the end of July, &amp; I got absorbed into some interdimensional outsourcing. Also, I had a lot of family stuff to take care of. I just got back from a Native American Dancing event last Sunday (I’m part Cherokee, courtesy of my dad). I also got The Orange Box &amp; the <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 1 Anthology Pack</span>. I have been playing <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 1: Black Mesa</span> (the VALVe-made GoldSource version, not the fan-made Source Mod or the VALVe-made Source Port) &amp; <span class="bbcode-i">Team Fortress Classic</span>. I also beat <span class="bbcode-i">Portal 1</span>. Also, I just Private Messaged you for the VMF file, .RK.</p>

            <p>If no one’s willing to pursue this and you can manage it, go nuts .RK. Additional BMS material by way of more vent explorations would be welcomed. If you proceed with this, vent headcrabs dropping down onto the player from above always provides a delicious moment or two of fright and panic. Maybe you could consider an instance of a crawling half-zombie, provided he and his animations can be accommodated by a vent.</p>

<p>Could work, though if the maps are already nearing entity limits, it’d probably be best to insert a new map instead of working with the limit.</p>

</aside>
<p>I actually did some poking around in the C map recently. It’s at around 92%. As opposed to A’s 180%. If there’s vents to be added, C would welcome them with open arms.</p>
<p>On that note, I also found out just how bad the spacial disparity is. Apparently the vents in C are <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">five</span></span> floors higher than their counterparts in A. Yuck.</p>
<p>OpenSource, I kinda threw together some tentative stuff on a vmf. I don’t know if you’re still working (or training for) this project, but there is that. If you’d like to see it I can send it via PM.</p>
<p>Going to throw this out there: if you <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> given up on this, I’ll do it myself once the Xen update hits. Or something like that. Maybe sooner, depending on how work on The Contract goes.</p>

            <p>I am not doing this…</p>
<p>The main reason is that it loads back to the first map of we got hostiles…</p>
<p>So it is too much work and I cannot be bothered…Basically if the last map would have been a new map then I may have given it a shot but because it means altering the first and third maos… Sorry not spending heaps of time on that</p>

            <p>If you are going to go through with this project (which you should!), and end up de-compiling that map, you should consider putting Joel’s old version of the WGH theme (the less intense, more acoustic version) in the fight in the warehouse room RIGHT before when you go up in the freight elevator to the surface.(The room with the really high roof. I’ll find pics if needed.) The song is timed almost perfectly for that fight, and since the tune will be associated with soldiers,  it’ll be fresh in the players mind, and when the elevator starts, and the intense version kicks in, it’ll create MAJOR anticipation!</p>

            <p>I actually think this would add something…I can’t see why it can not be added at the load point after the marines rapelling from the osprey… There is no way the last map before going on to blast pit is full… All that would be needed is adding to the last map in WGH no more I should not think.</p>
<p>Reasons to do it…</p>
<p>The alarms and vox lines create a sense of emergency<br>
It’s quite claustaphobic and would induce that the player is on the run.<br>
Headcrabs dieing on the fan blades that got cut from office complex could be moved here instead…</p>
<p>And I also have another idea… Would this really be much work?</p>
<p>I doubt it but then again It’s easy to say until you start mapping it.</p>

            <p>Or, alternatively, edit the C map and put the some vents there.</p>
<p>Or alternatively alternatively, change the load point between A and B. Though that would require much more work, and I have no idea where you’d move it to.</p>

            <p>Create a new map? It’s only got 3 maps, I think. The only thing really “missing” from WGH was the vent puzzle, which you could fit in a new map right after c1a3c, I think.</p>

<p>It was very methodically done and the pacing was spot on…I don’t know if this really needs any alterations…???</p>
<p>although I won’t rule the idea out because I keep going back to this one again and again.</p>

<p>It’s not easy making vents interesting, in all honesty. The only vent I really liked was that padded one somewhere in Office Complex, it felt really cozy and I kinda just wanted to sit in there and wait out the disaster.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Is it really necessary to get the most boring and useless part in WGH into Black Mesa?<br>
No offence, but thats just a waste of time.<br>
But whatever floats your boat.<br>
For the decompiling thing, just use Brushes and planes, and you’re good.</p>

            <p>If the vents lead to ammo for the Shotgun, Magnum, Mp5, pistol, batteries and health, it might be worth it to put them back in</p>
<p>Yes, I do believe you can get a Magnum before Power Up in Half-Life</p>

<p>I believe that there are Steam gift cards available at GameStop. You can call the closest one to you to make sure if they have them or not.</p>
