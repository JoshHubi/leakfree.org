Half-Life is set in 1998. It&#39;s official, and yes this has been confirmed by Valve.

Edit: Screw this, Marc disproved it.</description>

            <p>Sorry for the double post it’s been a couple days and I’ve done research it has been Confirmed by Mark Laidlaw that the 1998 date is false, the 200X date is still there. My guess is that the one who did the interview misinterpreted that 1998 was the year the game came out, not the actual year it takes place.</p>

            <p>So much info can be misinterpreted. anybody concider the fact that she may have heard the wrong date, or wrote it down wrong when getting the info? I’m sticking with the 200x date. 1998 is just…too coincidental for me.</p>

            <p>I think it was pretty obvious that the game takes place in 1998: that’s when HL was released, and they weren’t using equipment from the 2000’s in Black Mesa. They were using low tech tape computers and mechanical systems, which would not have been the case in, say, 2002 or later or something. Black Mesa uses tech from the late 20th century except for, of course, the inter-dimentional portals and other stuff that don’t exist. In the offices, every desk doesn’t even have a computer. Which means that we’re not in the 2000’s yet.</p>

<p>Don’t you guys understand that Black Mesa was WORKING on a similar project, wich means that black mesa just started to work with their portal project at the same time as aperture, when gordon arrived, It was pretty much finished, so i think it must have been much later then the 90’s. But thats just me. :freeman:</p>

            <p>“ending the outside world” is pretty strong language.</p>
<p>Individual portals are usually referred to as <span class="bbcode-i">doors</span>.<br>
It takes something pretty special to become a <span class="bbcode-i">gate</span>.<br>
Let us take, for instance the Tannhauser Gate.</p>

            <p>I’m too lazy to check but has anyone considered that “opening the interdimensional gate and ending the outside world” was simply when Black Mesa got their portal working? The resonance cascade occured years later after the Lambda Portal was activated.</p>

</aside>
<p>The only problem with this, is that it doesn’t seem like you read the second half of the final sentence in the article: “1998 - [<em>snip</em>]<br>
… Days later, that race is lost when Black Mesa successfully deploys an interdimensional gate through which an alien race emerges <span class="bbcode-b">and effectively ends the outside world.</span>”</p>
<p>They’re not talking about the race to portal technology being lost (well, I guess they <span class="bbcode-i">are,</span> but not in a slow, casual way,) they’re talking about the Resonance Cascade itself.  Putting the cascade itself in 1998 <span class="bbcode-i">would</span> conflict with Gordon’s employment letter from the game’s instruction manual, which is dated 200X, since Gordon kind of has to be there to make the cascade happen, so Ajax brings up a valid point.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, Black Mesa may very well have been secretly experimenting with primitive portal technology, or going back and fourth to and from Xen, long before Gordon was ever hired, but if this new timeline info is correct, that would place such primitive portal technology experimentation way before the year 1998, not in the 2+ year span from 1998 to 200X.  Of course, even if Black Mesa was able to portal successfully prior to 1998, this wouldn’t have ended the race between Aperture and Black Mesa, since the folks at Aperture would have no way of knowing what stage Black Mesa was at in their research, as the research wouldn’t have been released, and the technology not yet given to the government, (assuming that was their ultimate goal, anyway). Thus, the race to win whatever top secret contract they were most likely both working towards would have still been going strong, and that final sentence from the article would still be correct.</p>

<p>Agreed. It opens up too many holes. The letter that came with Half-Life was dated 200X, and while it is reasonable to assume that the portal tech was developed in '98, if Gordon wasn’t working for Black Mesa until 200X, then the Black Mesa Incident could not have happened before Gordon was an employee of the BMRF. Valve created a paradox by stating HL happened at least two years prior to the date where their main character was employed.</p>
<p>I always figure HL took place in 2003 or 2004, myself…</p>

<p>That’s exactly what she says. Valve just gave her an updated timeline, that’s all!</p>

<p>But she DID add the last part. Check the aperture site. No update. Meagen or whatever does not equal valve. Seems like she made a mistake and is trying to redirect attention.</p>

            <p>Thanks Muhb. The guy definately sounds like he’s speculating more than actually explaining what’s going on. And Meagan’s tone (“They didn’t want to confirm anything.”) indicates she may not know about the actual date. But I’m still open to having it in 1998, but it just seems like a big retcon for stuff we have so much info showing that it’s taking place in 200x.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Game Informer podcast confirmed taht Portal is set a couple of years after the HL2 story arc. That gives more sense to GLaDOS’ words" “All I know is I’m the only thing standing between us and them. Well, I was.” She seems to acknowledge that the Combine has been defeated, but we still need Ep3 to confirm this.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They said that Portal <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">2</span></span> is set “quote ‘well after Half-Life 2,’” after which point one guy chimed in and said Portal 1 takes place “sometime after <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> of the events in Half-Life 2,” but I think that this was mere speculation on his part, not necessarily something that came from Valve… at least, that’s how it sounded to me.</p>
<p>GLaDOS’ dialog there can be taken a number of ways, that line could have been said during the events immediately following the resonance cascade, or sometime shortly after Gordon’s awakening, due to the ruckus he was most likely causing outside, or at any point in between, during the Combine’s rule.  I suppose she could have said that after the combine were defeated… but, well, if <span class="bbcode-i">you</span> were an AI designed by humans, with knowledge of a world run by humans, which would you find more strange: A world being taken over and/or run by aliens, or a world back in the command of humans after said aliens have been defeated? <em>shrug</em> :retard:</p>
<p>I don’t think we’ll ever really know exactly when Chell first woke up, since it’s probably not critical information for the events of the Portal series, but I personally think that it’s a bit of a stretch to say that it occurred <span class="bbcode-i">after</span> the combine were defeated.  Oh well… just my 2 cents.</p>
<p>Also, who’s to know that the combine ever actually <span class="bbcode-i">get</span> defeated…? Maybe the HL2 story arc is a tragedy… we can’t know for sure just yet, until EP3 comes out… DUN DUN DUNNNN! :what:</p>

<p>Um, Game Informer cannot confirm something about a story element that Valve has kept under wraps since 2007. I’d like to see the podcast honestly. Game Informer was not told the entire Half Life Storyline just for a few interviews and articles about Portal. As far as I’m concerned it takes place in  December 2003.</p>
