    <title>UnderRated Movies</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/underrated-movies/409</link>
    <description>What&#39;s your favorite movie that got low ratings, or was good but no one heard of it? Whats it about and why did you like it?

Here&#39;s Mine:

Miracle Mile (1988 ) 
One of those cool real-time movies where a man recieves a phone call about the nuclear apocloypse. He has one hour to find his girlfriend and get the hell out of LA.

I loved the premise, and everything was so overly intense it was almost laughable. Especially when everyone learns an hour later that nukes are coming and are killing each other to get out. My second favorite cold war movie to Red Dawn.

Cheesy Trailer

            <p>Well even in respect to both of those films, it’s not like they turned them into ‘movie stars’ that could command millions of dollars per film or anything, just fairly well-known actors. I’ll try and track it down.</p>

<p>Could be. I just assumed that due to their comparatively low budget with some of the other Hollywood horror films they couldn’t afford actors who were that well-known. Perhaps they could. You should definitely get round to watching it though.</p>

            <p>Zodiac (way good, especially if your interested in the actual case)</p>
<p>The life aquatic (kind of weird but really funny)</p>
<p>Ghost world - Really fucking great movie, probably in my top 10.</p>
<p>Romper stomper - low budget aussie film about skinheads, good stuff</p>
<p>flight of the phoenix (1960s one, not that retarded remake) Probably one of the only older movies I actually like, these dudes crash a plane in the desert and decide to rebuild a smaller plane out of the wreckage and fly out of there, they battle insanity and just about everything else in the desert.</p>
<p>being John Malkovich - I cant explain it for you, youll have to see it for yourself.</p>

            <p>^ I liked that too, but I never thought it was underrated. It was over the top in some places, but the set design, story, action and atmosphere made up for that in spades.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this was well-received or not, but I’m certain it’s a hidden gem. It’s called Deathwatch. It was a British horror film made on a reasonably low budget and set in the trenches in WWI. It’s good for many reasons, but mainly because of the cast, who have nearly all now gone on to great success, with actors such as Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis. It’s pretty awesome.</p>

            <p>I get the feeling that a properly made Mystery Men sequel would have been much better than the first movie, and that those characters really could have shined if they had made one.</p>
<p>As it is, yes, it has its moments. I think the pacing was just off for the first half of the movie. The second half is great though.</p>

            <p>Geoffrey Rush was great in that flick, well, as per usual.</p>
<p>Hank Azaria was also pretty damned funny, and I think Ben Stiller finally perfected the character he would play for every single following role ever.</p>
<p>Amazing that Paul Reubens still has a hollywood career.</p>
<p>After having just seen it, I really have to say Outlander was really good, even if a bit outlandish. hur hur.</p>
<p>Also going to throw in Stargate in this thread, really quite incredible for 1994.</p>
<p>Makes me regret that movie studios aren’t ballsy enough to take a chance on such ideas anymore, sticking instead to comic book movies and remakes.  Lame.</p>

<p>I actually liked Batman Begins more than The Dark Knight.</p>

            <p>I’ll give you that one.</p>
<p>The crazy assed fight scenes (choreography and all) not to mention the eccentric characters ring more of Rodriguez’ style to me.</p>
<p>Tarantino was much more about the hipster dialogue and whatnot until he got acquainted with Rodriguez.</p>
<p>I was too young (not yet born) to know if this flick was underrated at the time, but considering it seems to be one of his less known films I’m throwing in Peter Sellers’ The Party in this thread.  Absolutely hilarious.</p>

            <p>Perhaps. I always felt that Saints owed more to Tarantino than Rodriguez, but I dunno. The prayer they recite before executing some cat definitely is ripped straight from Pulp Fiction.</p>

            <p>I think Robert Rodriquez would have been the better director to quote, I find he had much more to do with (re)kicking off of gunfighter movies than Tarantino did.  Closest would have been Reservoir Dogs, and that still doesn’t jive with the gunfighter feel that Rodriguez was pulling off with El Mariachi, Desperado, etc, which Boondock Saints most definitely felt like.</p>

            <p>Ha ha! Sir, if you think Boondock Saints was anything but an attempt to cash in on what Tarantino’s films did (and a poor one at that), you’ve got another thing coming. I’m not saying it’s a bad movie (hell, any movie that kills a man by dropping a toilet on his head and has a flamboyant transvestite Willem Dafoe is all right in my book), but if you think a single frame was an original attempt at filmmaking, you be wrooong, son!</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, and underrated movies? Swordfish, man. The opening scene is one of the coolest I’ve ever seen, and while the rest of the movie seems to have been made by the kids who were too mentally disabled to make it on the shortbus, it has a topless Halle Berry and a flying helicopter/bus. Oh, and Wolverine hacking a government mainframe with a gun to his head and a mouth on his cock.</p>

            <p>It was a decent enough flick.  I felt it was trying to cash in on what Boondock Saints did though.  Still good film.</p>

            <p>The Way of the Gun. It is a very subtle movie for all of its action sequences. There isn’t really any point where everything is explicitly told to the viewer. You have to watch and pay attention to know what is going on. And the action sequences make a hell of a lot of sense too. I love it so much.</p>
