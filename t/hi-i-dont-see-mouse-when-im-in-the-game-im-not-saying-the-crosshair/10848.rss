    <description>Hi to all...  :frowning: 

When i&#39;m in the game and pause the game, can&#39;t see my mouse and have to select the options with the keyboard... it&#39;s because the requirements of my PC... ? I don&#39;t suffer low fps or something, so... :&#39;(

Thanks for everything.

Saludos.</description>

Make some changes in in-game option, even though I highly doubt there will be such option as hide the mouse point.</p>

<p>Thank you, i’m lookin’ to it. In fact, in The Witcher and F.E.A.R. had the same problems, problems to find my mouse point. So yeah, i think is going to be a problem of my graphic card…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
