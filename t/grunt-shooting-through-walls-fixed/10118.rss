    <title>Grunt shooting through walls [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/grunt-shooting-through-walls-fixed/10118</link>
    <description>I reached where a grunt is hanging from a rope down a shaft. I took him out but when I stepped out into the shaft I was immediately fired upon. I could not find a shooter anywhere.

So I turned on God mode and noclip and found the culprit standing on the roof of the shaft, with no line of site, happily shooting me through the concrete ceiling.

Sorry I don&#39;t have a getpos. I didn&#39;t know I needed it when I played through that section.</description>

            <p>Happened to me about 7 or 8 times now (kept reloading to try and work out where the heck they were)…<br>
Has loaded correctly once - but of course at that stage I was expecting the invisible guy again, got smashed up real good, and reloaded thinking it would work if I followed a similar path again… It didn’t :S</p>
<p>I also had an invisible headcrab too - in the confined area after jumping over some crates where there are 2 tripod sentries to greet you. 3 headcrabs spawn in after you deal with the sentries, but I could only see 2 of them. And the 3rd was definitely present and moving around as expected… I kept getting hit by it.</p>

<p>Had the same issue. Only one guy stood in the shaft (left), others were invisible but shooting from the top.</p>
<p>Played the chapter again later and then the whole rope-sequence worked as intended, I think they were 3 rope-guys - one after another.</p>
<p>I think I was too slow in my first play through of that sequence, maybe I missed “the right time” for a specific “one more rope-guy”-trigger.</p>

            <p>This happened to me too.  I figured out he was probably shooting me through the rocks so I just ran away.</p>
