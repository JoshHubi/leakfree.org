    <title>So what&#39;s with the sprint in Multiplayer?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-whats-with-the-sprint-in-multiplayer/13928</link>
    <description>Excuse me if this has been discussed before, but I believe that a key part of the game has been blocked in Multiplayer, Sprinting.

Now to some people it might be okay, but to others like me and some players from Half-Life 2 Deathmatch it feels weird and uncomfortable to have such a thing removed from Multiplayer.

If the Black Mesa Dev Team is not willing to allow sprinting in Multiplayer in a default condition, then I will ask them to do one thing if possible...

sv_allow_sprint 1/0

A command which only server owner/people with rcon access will be able to change. A conditional sprint in Multiplayer for any admin who likes his server to have sprinting enabled.

That is all.</description>

            <p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/57367-Slendgy/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@Slendgy</a> , yes I did , 16 , in some maps (small) its common that they are very close to each other that’s why it looks fast paced, because there is 2muchaction2handle.</p>
<p>Like I said, if it be a simple 1v1 for example , then I’d say its a CSGO game on dust2 , except that you have longjump and a tau gun.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to simply put it… I don’t get it when you say its fast paced lol</p>

            <p>What about walking though? Sometimes I like to sneak up on unsuspecting people with my crowbar…</p>
<p>EDIT: Not 5 seconds after I posted this, I remembered that crouching is a thing. Although that still makes a whole bunch of noise, if I remember correctly.</p>

            <p>I’d also like to point out that the movement speed in BMDM is about the same speed as the SP sprint.</p>

            <p>Im glad there’s no sprinting, it would just make trying to hit anyone just way too difficult and annoying. The multiplayer is already fast paced no need to make it faster.</p>

<p>This might be your problem. Half-Life’s multiplayer does not play the same as Half-Life 2’s multiplayer.</p>

            <p>HL1 did not have sprinting in multiplayer. We experimented with sprinting as a mechanic and deemed that it dumbed down the gameplay and did not add anything substantial. It was a gameplay design decision which we stand by. We have no plans to reenable sprinting.</p>
