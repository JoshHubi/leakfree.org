    <title>Braid&#39;s Story.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/braids-story/2791</link>
    <description>Okay so I just finished playing Braid, and I found every hidden text but seriously, I didn&#39;t get a single thing about the story. It is about Tim, right? And it&#39;s the story of his relationship with The Princess, no? How he found her, and how it all ended. But I&#39;ve read some things about a nuclear bomb thing and I didn&#39;t understand anything.

Could anyone explain it to me? Please?

            <p>I wouldn’t say it gave me nightmares (as I never remember my dreams. Or well maybe it did but I don’t know it), but it definitely shook me a bit.</p>

            <p>Yeah, if you collect all the stars then you can catch up with the princess on the last level and she explodes. The story pieces you unlock for it basically reveal that she symbolized the development of atomic weapons in the 40’s.</p>
<p>On another note, Braid gave me nightmares. It really shook my world in some basic way. I don’t know why. It’s not like it’s a new, novel idea (in fact, taken at base value, it’s incredibly similar to the movie Memento). But it freaked me out for days after I beat it.</p>

            <p>Yeah I at the end you’re not trying to save her but instead you were sneaking on her and she tried to escape from you.</p>
<p>I have found this interesting <a href="https://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?showtopic=190136" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">thread</a> promoting the idea of the nuclear bomb.</p>

            <p>Well, first off, the Princess is running from you.  The entire time, you are trying to find her, but as it turns out, you are the dark knight who abused her.  She is only trying to get away.</p>
<p>It’s also been theorized the Princess may represent the discovery of the atom bomb.  If you collect every star, the screen basically explodes, if I recall correctly.</p>
