    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/installations-of-new-models-for-hl-azure-sheep-etc/1867</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve downloaded the files but I don&#39;t know if I should simply dump them on the game&#39;s diretory (in this case, creating a new section named &quot;Models&quot;) or if I should copy and replace the original files of the models.

Really, I don&#39;t know how to do it.</description>

            <p>my half-life is the steam’s version.<br>
A weird thing happened: when I was looking for the models folder, there weren’t any archive of model, only another folder called player.<br>
I’ve searched the whole directory, but I wasn’t able to find the files to overwrite them.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Any goldsource mod you install (at least if you’re using steam) will have the main mod folder located in the half-life folder (along side the valve folder from the first option i mentioned). The models and sounds folders should be located directly in the main mod folder, so you should be able to just drop the models folder right into it, and get the same merging and overwriting options.</li>
</ol>
<p>So for each game or mod that you want to change how the models look, you’ll want to install the models upgrade pack for each one separately.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not necessarily. As long as a mod doesn’t supply its own models replacing the stock valve ones you will only need to drop the upgrade pack in the “valve” folder. The game searches content in this order “mod” &gt; “valve” folder &gt; gcf, so for instance a “hgrunt.mdl” coming with a mod will have precedence over the same model in the “valve” folder and the gcf.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if a mod comes packaged with models also contained in the upgrade pack means there have been some adjustments to it that if replaced may bork the mod. But I could be wrong.</p>

            <p>I think what might be causing the confusion is that with the way the models are sometimes packaged, you tend to get the impression that there is one location you install to which will affect all your HL games and mods. Like Minotaur said above me, most installation packs like this will have folders. The best thing to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the case of your Half Life, look in the “half-life” folder for a folder called “valve” in there should be folders for models, sounds, and that type of thing. If you drop the models folder from your installation pack into the “valve” folder, then Windows will usually ask you if you want to merge the folders, and from there it’s just a matter of agreeing to merge and overwrite the original files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of opposing force, you’d want to look for the “gearbox” folder, instead of the valve folder. In this case you follow the same steps that you did with the valve folder for half-life. Theoretically, I would imagine that blue shift WOULD work the same way, but there’s some sort of weird block that Steam has that won’t let you install new models to Blue Shift. For this, I use the Blue Shift: Unlocked mod that recreates Blue Shift as a Half Life mod, and for that you’d use the steps below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any goldsource mod you install (at least if you’re using steam) will have the main mod folder located in the half-life folder (along side the valve folder from the first option i mentioned). The models and sounds folders should be located directly in the main mod folder, so you should be able to just drop the models folder right into it, and get the same merging and overwriting options.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So for each game or mod that you want to change how the models look, you’ll want to install the models upgrade pack for each one separately.</p>

            <p>If you got a bunch of folders, called things like Models and Sounds then just put them in the main folder (the one with these folders already) and tell it to overwrite.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>install them into the mod’s ‘models’ directory<br>
eg. HL- valve/models<br>
TFC- tfc/models<br>
ect.<br>
Place any sounds in /sounds (they should be sorted into the proper directories from there)<br>
and sprites in /sprites.<br>
If it already comes with a models folder, look in there, look at the files to check its what you want, and put it in the mod directory (eg. valve for HL.)</p>
