    <title>A growing concern, and how we can help</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-growing-concern-and-how-we-can-help/8449</link>
    <description>I first learned of Black Mesa Source&#39;s existence in 2007.  Needless to say, as any self-respecting Half Life fan I probably...no wait... did orgasm in my own pants.  Being a long-time player of game mods the idea of a project as huge as Black Mesa was, and still is the stuff that legends are born into.  2009 came and went as everyone here very well knows (so no need to repeat the details).  After that I, as many others in the casual gaming/mod world checked back less and less for updates regarding BM.  I completely understand the devs&#39; reasoning for lack of updates or info regarding BM.  I may not agree with one or two of them, but this thread is not about whether or not I agree with their reasoning.

  I can just speak from the perspective of having many friends and colleges that never come on the forums or visit the site.  With that being said, in a world where word of mouth does as much for advertising any game, I have noticed a drop in anticipation amongst the kinds of pc gamers that take a more casual approach to gaming, whether due to their professional or personal lives.  

This is what concerns me.  I do not want by the time Black Mesa Source is finally released for their to be less fans bowing to the sheer glory that will be BMS due to a decreased amount of interest.  With a mod this close to release (whenever it might be) wouldn&#39;t it be nothing but beneficial to do something to add to the power that the word of mouth carries in the gaming community.  It seems only logical to continually be trying to pull in new potential players into being fascinated and interested in this mod.

With this I pose this question...

Is there anything WE can do to help pull more people in, as well as keep people who already about BMS still interested? 

This can be instigated and/or fostered by the developers of any game.  But it can also be fostered by the community closest to said game&#39;s development.  If the dev team chooses not to release new media or information regarding BMS, then doesn&#39;t it fall to us as gamers that want to see this mod succeed to help bring fellow gamers into discovering/rediscovering Black Mesa Source?

            <p>Lol. Yeah fair point old chap.</p>
<p>On Topic then: I’d help spread the word when the mod is actually out. As has already been said, spreading the word wouldn’t actually do any good at the moment, and more than likely be detrimental to its popularity ( and perhaps even give some idiots reason to hate it when it IS released ). In other words we’d be even MORE full of impatient tossers then we already are. I totally see where your coming from, don’t get me wrong, but this mod will be the most popular HL mod out there when released, especially if we then help spread the word.</p>

<p>OK - Except that’s also not the topic of the thread.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong - post what you like as far as I’m concerned. And your comment seems perfectly reasonable. But it’s no more on-topic than any other comment since page 1.</p>

            <p>Not entirely sure where this thread has gone, but regardless…</p>
<p>On Topic: The source engine is still one of the most realistic and down right best looking engines out there imo. The sheer scale of improvements already implemented and the potential it has in the future only shows it’s longetivity. I was playing L4D yesterday in the first time in literally a year and it just ‘feels there’ so to speak.</p>
<p>Anyone complaing about an engine that is still being used for retail games today is just an idiot imo, especially when they overlook every aspect of the games mechanics and the fun they ( I assume ) get out of it.</p>
<p>I know this has already been said on the first page, but seriously, graphics REALLY aren’t the important thing. Christ that is one of the things that has proven Valve to be one of the if not THE best developer out there. They don’t piss around hyping up graphics because they don’t NEED to, their games speak for themselves without.</p>
<p>I’d love to address the guy who can’t play Deus Ex because of its graphics, but that person is not even worthy of the effort. I could of even used this paragraph right now, and even this scentence! Even that very exclamation mark in doing so. However I shant simply on principle.</p>

            <p>As long as we’re talking about chicken and rice recipes, I find that some roasted jalapenos kill two birds with one stone. You can garnish the chicken with the peppers themselves and drizzle the leftover sauce on your rice/mashed potatoes/what have you.</p>

<p>Yep, and since I owned it already a looooooong time ago, your at criticism becomes the affirming, nipply embrace I get when Eva Mendes hugs me.  So thanks for the hug, Eva.  How far are you from where those real Vidalia onions are grown?  Winter’s almost over, and I need a supplier…</p>

<p>So, it’s a turnoff. So what? My guess is that it would be even better for them if they left this place to rot completely, ditching the overhead of maintaining this mess.</p>
