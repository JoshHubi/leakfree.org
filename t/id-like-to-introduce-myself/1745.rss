    <title>I&#39;d like to introduce myself.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/id-like-to-introduce-myself/1745</link>
    <description>Hello there, everyone! I&#39;ve been observing the progress of BMS for quite a while and I felt it was time to finally create an account here. I&#39;m not sure if this is the correct sub-forum to introduce myself in, but there were no better choices.

So here I am!

I&#39;m Jake Maheu. I&#39;m 15 and I&#39;ve been mapping in the Source engine for about a year. I originally worked with HL2 :smiley: M, but I&#39;m now getting my feet wet in Team Fortress 2 mapping. I run my own [url=&#39;https://www.jakemaheu.com&#39;]website/blog[/url] (which I need to update, badly), and I&#39;m fluent in HTML and CSS (not CS:S, mind you). My current project is a TF2 CP map called cp_foolsgravel. I&#39;ve been working with computers since I was quite young and can fix damn near any problem you might encounter.

My thoughts on BMS:

I like the idea. From the media released so far, it seems that the team has put a ridiculous amount of effort into the project and I believe that it will turn out for the better. I&#39;m actually getting quite antsy due to it being due within ~60 days. The transition from GoldSrc to the EP2 engine will be a dramatic change, and many will take issue with the new rendition of an older game. While most die-hard fans will consider it an improvement, there will always be detractors. Don&#39;t let them keep you down, though, because the work you&#39;re doing is amazing. The render released of the hyrdoelectric dam, quite frankly, shows what many would consider to be Valve-quality. One quick question, if you will; Is there any way for you to include the game&#39;s files in a GCF?

I&#39;m actually quite worried for the website. Upon release, the server will be linked everywhere-- Digg, Engadget, BoingBoin, maybe even Slashdot. You&#39;ll be hit with hundreds of gigabytes of traffic. Are the servers prepared for the load? Do you have enough moderators in the forums to handle the sudden influx of new users? How is the game being distributed, by the way? Theoretically, a group of developers seeding the mod through BitTorrent could allow for a massive amount of downloads with a much smaller hit on the server. There would still be a lot of data-- the .torrent files still use a small amount of bandwidth, but the actual files would only need to be seeded until more people have downloaded it. I&#39;d imagine that the devs have already prepared for this, though. Nonetheless, I&#39;m happy for all of you. I&#39;ve gotten a lot of laughs from this forum and I&#39;m looking forward to the fruit of your labour.

<p>Hello, great to meet you. You seem polite and well worded, you’ll be a wonderful addition to the community.</p>
<p>EDIT: looked on your site and I couldn’t find any pics of your maps, was wondering if you could show off a few of them for us here.</p>

<p>Yes, yes I am. I could get highspeed in my area, but it’s too damn expensive right now. Still looking for a cheap ISP around here. :fffuuu:<br>

</aside>
<p>It’s nice to meet you, too. I’ll try and put up some pictures of my older maps, but I warn you that they’re not exactly nice. The Episode 1 engine/hammer is quite unforgiving. Since I’ve switched to TF2, my life has been a great deal easier. It’s 6:15 A.M. where I’m at now, so I’ve got school in about 30 minutes. If I can get some pics up, though, I’ll let you know.</p>
