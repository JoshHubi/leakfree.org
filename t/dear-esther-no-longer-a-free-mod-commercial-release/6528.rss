The groundbreaking game, which replaces traditional FPS gameplay with the exploration of a desolate island, a deep and emotional story and a stunning soundtrack, will be launched on Steam later this year. Over the last twelve months, the award-winning mod (Indiecade 2009, Mod of the Year 2010) has been re-developed by Robert Briscoe (Mirror&#39;s Edge) in collaboration with the original creator, Dan Pinchbeck.

            <p>Well it looks nice though I probably wouldn’t buy it for that. I wouldn’t even be able to buy it if I wanted to. So I’ll just shrug and forget about it and hope black mesa will be free.<br>
I can’t play many new games that are coming out now because I still have a shitty single core so finding something fun and new that I can actually play is rare.</p>
<p>Next thing I know Black mesa decides to upgrade to portal 2’s source build and blow up on graphics.<br>
Kind of ranted there, sorry.</p>

<p>If you faggots don’t like it being a commercial release then you should have commented on his post where he specifically asked if we liked the idea.</p>

<p>He asked if we wanted it to become a proper indie game. Indie games don’t make real money.</p>
<p>So how would we have known that he meant charging for it?</p>

<p>I heard about this game a little before it came out but hadn’t played it till now. I was intrigued with the idea so I did a little research on the game. It was a research project at a college to see what would happen if a game was stripped of all action and only had the narrative left over. It was also supposed to be ambiguous as to the story. Depending on how one interprets the story, each person can have completely different ideas of who you are, who Esther is, what the island stands for, heck if you are even alive or not. I doubt the story will change much, actually I think the voice overs might be the one thing they are porting directly from the original game. I for one am looking forward to it. While I found the mod very slow, for some reason I want to replay it again. It was unlike any experience I have ever had in a video game.</p>

            <p>But he also said its not just the story that wasn’t enjoyable, he didn’t like how there was little action or whatever.</p>
<p>While I never played Dear Esther, I understand that. I don’t think I will play it because I play video games for action and gore and things like that.</p>

<p>The rest of your post is irrelevant; this single statement narrows down why you didn’t like it. Not saying it’s your fault that you didn’t understand it… but it’s your fault.</p>
