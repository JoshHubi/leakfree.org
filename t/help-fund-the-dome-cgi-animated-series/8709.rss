    <description>Mighty Treehouse is trying to do the unprecedented: produce a full 90 minute, professional level cgi animated feature/web series at 1% of the cost. They hope to get the first two episodes done through kickstarter (where you come in) and the rest through ad revenue. You can check it out here and decide if it is worth your $$$:
