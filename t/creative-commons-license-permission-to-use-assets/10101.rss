    <description>Hello BMS team,

I did post this question [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=494019&amp;postcount=195&#39;]here[/url], but it seems its just going to get lost in amongst the other questions.

I belong to a smaller mod which some of you may have heard of &quot;The Darkmod&quot; (TDM). While playing BMS I observed the odd ambient sound or dirty texture that would work well with TDM.

As BMS was created with CC licence, I would humbly like to ask for permission for my team/mod to use a small amount of the aforementioned sounds/textures.

kind regards
