    <title>The Glock 17 for HECU Marines</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-glock-17-for-hecu-marines/7875</link>
    <description>Originally, Hecu marines would fire they&#39;re Mp5&#39;s, or Spas-12&#39;s until they ran out of ammunition, at which point they would drop said weapon, and equip a glock 17. Weather this sidearm had unlimited ammunition is unknown, as it is irrelevant- But according to the WIKI, this was removed because it made grunts much weaker, players would simply take cover until they switched to they&#39;re pea shooters. 
I think that the Idea was originally pretty interesting, and though it had flaws, [i]it should be revised[/i]. 
Perhaps Grunts who are killed by a player, have a percentage chance of dropping to the ground in an animation, and whilst down, whip out they&#39;re pistol to make a last-ditch effort to kill Freeman, and in turn, possibly survive. 
Not only would such a feature make sense, (they Are wearing ballistic plates, against presumably 9mm rounds, and other weaponry from the late 90&#39;s (not counting nuclear/alien weps))
[COLOR=&#39;LightBlue&#39;][b]Pros of this feature: [/b]
adds alot of character to the game- makes player feel &#39;my god, I&#39;m killing human beings,&#39; despite how monstrous they&#39;re actions are. A good sense of inner conflict, as well as pity for the enemy. It allows for headshots to have more relevance, and for the player to think twice before charging into a room, guns blazing, or if anything, double check if they&#39;re really dead or not.
[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;][b]Cons of this feature:[/b]
This will require manpower, and a at least 9-10 hours to code, animate, and get the voice-acting down. It will take at least a week or two to implement into the game, as well as test and rig so that it isn&#39;t so awkward. 
[COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;][b]What it may mean for black mesa:[/b]
Not only will this show players that black mesa is a mod with some soul to it, but it will make players go back again and again, having fun that lasts, and enjoying the fantastic voice acting that it would require. &quot;Damn, thats cool!&quot; and &quot;gah, this guy&#39;s shooting me from behind, I thought I killed him!&quot;

Thanks for reading, Developer or not, and hopefully this is considered, if not added.  :smiley:</description>

If the devs could add something like that it would make me feel pretty bad. But then again it’s probaly too late to ask for something like that.</p>

            <p>The only reason I’d see a weapon switch from primary to secondary is due to running out of ammunition in the current magazine in the gun, and not being in sufficient cover to reload. Then the grunt could whip out the nine and suppress wildly in the player’s general direction while he sprints to hard cover. His squadmates should also suppress to cover the teammate while he gets behind something.</p>
<p>I seem to remember the Javid saying something to that extent in the “Got A Question” thread once, the last time Grunt Glocks(pat. pend) got brought up.</p>

            <p>I wonder if perhaps we could do better to simply cut out the middle-man, so to speak, and not require any major coding (and the many hours of testing that it would demand) by just having all the grunts drop more than their main weapon? I know Uncle Sam is bankrupt but how is it that all our fine soldiers in Black Mesa seem to have only the bullets in their guns? What the hell is the point of those big vests covered in pouches if nothing is in them???</p>
<p>Simple Solution: Use the same code that allows grunts with secondary fire modes to drop a munition of that secondary fire along with the main weapon. Have that code drop one or two magazines of bullets, a glock, and a small chance of a hand-grenade or 40mm shell.</p>
<p>Effect: Lots of ammo for those who like to shoot things a lot and a minimum of work for our skilled dev-team.</p>

            <p>This discussion just makes me hope for a mod for HL2 and it’s eps with all the features of BM, that much more.</p>
<p>Also, while I don’t really want to feel bad for the marines anyway, an ‘occasional’ one crawling away begging for you to end his life, seems like it’d be pretty easy after the 4th time you do it. One time maybe, but occasionally? It’d turn into this:</p>
<p>First time:</p>
<p>Soldier: Please…kill me…<em>chokes up blood</em><br>
Me: <em>tears up, points gun, shoots</em></p>
<p>Second time:</p>
<p>Soldier: Please kill me…<em>chokes up blood</em><br>
Me: Oh…oh god…it’ll all be over soon… <em>shoots</em></p>
<p>Third time:</p>
<p>Soldier: Please kill me…<em>chokes up blood</em><br>
Me: Again? Well alright. <em>shoots</em></p>
<p>Fourth time:</p>
<p>Soldier: Plea-<em>shoots</em><br>
Me: ded.</p>

<p>You could probably better achieve this affect with the occasional marine slowly   crawling away, and if freeman approaches begging for, help, his life, or   to be put out of his misery; only to die shortly afterwards.</p>

Then you would completely empathise with their plight, especially with the fact that you have caused them to succumb to the forces of chaos.<br>
What would be great is that once you have killed them completely you are shown a 5-10 minute cut scene of the aftermath of your actions.<br>
It would start with the phonecall to the wife of the soldier who would then proceed to cry and then tell the children that their daddy had died at the hands of a crazed scientist in a bionic suit.</p>
<p>Then of course there would be the scene where the children are sent to councilling sessions.  The funeral scene would be especially poignant.</p>
<p>This would really make you feel the consequences of your actions, especially after you have been forced to watch this cutscene for every soldier you kill.</p>

            <p>I’m sure it could be done with jigglebones &amp; attachments. Or the soldiers could simply drop their weapons before drawing the pistol. Or simply keep using it like a sane person.</p>
<p>However, having them switch to pistol when out of ammo would make sense. They could use it until they find cover to reload.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The one problem with that would be that if you wanted to handle that realistically, it would require the following:</p>
<p>a. An animation for switching guns. This would be the most basic application of the concept. But to make it look <span class="bbcode-i">good</span>, you’d add more:</p>
<p>b. A sling for all weapons used by the Marines. Not only would it be physically simulated against the character model it would be used to sling the weapon across the chest for drawing the pistol and remain there until the marine switched back to his primary weapon.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjvEqpgkY9o&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=147s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjvEqpgkY9o&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=147s</a></p>
<p>Notice how the Russian soldiers have their weapons slung across their chests while utilizing the knife for close range work. It appears to be more or less glued to the character models, with the sling drawn between the main character model and the weapon model he is carrying.</p>
<p>I’m quite certain such a feature would be out of the technical capabilities of the source engine and would have to be hard coded in as a new feature, and these programming tricks may differ across graphics cards. In other words, incorporating a seamless primary to secondary transition that sits well with the level of detail on display in Black Mesa is simply an unrealistic proposition. At least in the manner I’ve described.</p>

<p>Maybe a grunt with a shotgun could use a pistol or a rifle from the distance and switch to shotgun in close range, but this is the only case in wich i think it’d be good.</p>

<p>Just because something is unique doesn’t mean it’s good. This is a remake of a classic videogame to take advantage of the source engine’s capabilities &amp; to make the series more accessible to new players. Adding a feature that isn’t in any of the other games alienates old &amp; new players alike. If you want to be experimental, this is not the best way to do so.</p>

</aside>
<p>And just because it’s professional, doesn’t make it “call of duty”. Call of duty didn’t invent real-time scenic animations for NPC’s. I don’t blame you for assuming that I had believed so, a great many of the black mesa community are also “call of duty” players- But I’m just as interested in the video game industry for it’s entertainment value, as I am its artistic and creative value.<br>
Most people who play call of duty without appreciating it’s development, or that of other video games, are either children, or people who don’t appreciate sophisticated thought.<br>
And I’m not trying to “troll” either- I just think that video games that have elements more out-of-the ordinary, and creative, deserve more praise for just those reasons.<br>
It certainly is a hard industry to get into- and most companies don’t want college under-grads who can ‘draw really well’, they want Artists who have classes under they’re belt, and the ability to be absolutely innovative with they’re work.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">But I digress, and I think I’ve gone off track a bit.</span></p>

</aside>
<p>Disagree on both points.  On the former - it defies gaming conventions, because despite the existence of body armor and bullet physics, players expect grunts to be dead when the death animation plays, and finding out that isn’t the case will just get annoying.</p>
<p>And the latter - Just because Call of Duty does it doesn’t make it professional.</p>

This Idea is an improvement over that which the original half life’s grunt npc’s had, and while it by no means replaces the fantastic gameplay elements the first had, It will definitely add to what Black mesa claims to feature.<br>
The majority of you seem fairly confident that the game does not require it, and it certainly does not, but If it was included, I know for a fact that it would <span class="bbcode-b">make the game more enjoyable, and feel more professional</span>.[/SIZE]</p>
<p>Edit: And K3NNY150, I understand your concerns, and Agree- to a certain extent. Making a suggestion thread doesn’t mean there is any obligation towards the developers to consider them. ah well, “they said my story was cool, and then they called me <span class="bbcode-i">bro</span>”</p>
