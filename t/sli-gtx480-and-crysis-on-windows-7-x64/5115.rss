    <title>SLI GTX480 and Crysis on Windows 7 x64</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sli-gtx480-and-crysis-on-windows-7-x64/5115</link>
    <description>With my new rig, I wanted to get Crysis going on it. Though like other people it seems, I&#39;m having issues with it. I&#39;ve done what seems to have worked for others running it in compatibility modes for XP and Vista in all service pack options, I&#39;ve even tried the NoCD crack that was rumored to work. Updated to 1.2.1 as well.

Though the thing that I&#39;m experiencing that no one else seems to, is I launch the Crysis.exe from my bin64 folder and I get the mouse with the thinking ring and then nothing. Not even a black screen or any resemblance of a boot up. The Crysis64.exe launches, though hits the black screen and then stops entirely. Ctrl+Alt+Dlt out and end the program.

I noticed after I would run the Crysis64.exe a &quot;Game&quot; txt file shows up. I scroll through and it is the diagnostics of my system. Everything reads fine except my GPUs. It shows that they are &#39;unknown&#39;. My GPUs are running the latest working drivers as of July 19, 2010. SLI is recognized on the computer and through Speccy. 

I have no issue running any games from the HL series, CS:S, TF2, or anything else.

Anyone have thoughts as to why my GPUs aren&#39;t recognized? I&#39;ve seen plenty of people running it on GTX480s, so I have no idea what&#39;s up.

NOTE: Merge this with another Crysis issues thread if deemed necessary. Though I don&#39;t think this relates to those issues, hence the new thread.</description>

            <p>It is? I booted the disc up, hit “Install”. Then typed in the CD key it came with and installed it. Now it’s broke.</p>
<p>Got it working!</p>
<p>EDIT: It’s so pretty…</p>

            <p>Event viewer is kinda a crapshoot in actually figuring out what anything says.  I don’t know much about computers, so I just look and see if I can find any errors or warnings that correspond to the time a crash/error happened, and see if it’s got the program’s name in its log somewhere.  Then, I try to look to see if it says anything that either mentions some word I recognize, or something that looks like it could be some kind of identifier for the issue (like the BCCode when you get a BSOD).</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/fnoigy">@Fnoigy</a>: You’re talking about the “Event-Viewer” yeah? If so, I know how to open it, just don’t know how to read it [guess I’m just retarded with that area]. And I got the drivers right off the nVidia site that weren’t beta drivers. And there are people running Crysis on SLI 480s. Sorry. :]</p>

            <p>Also check system logs to see if those give any more explanation for what went wrong.</p>
<p>Also, shouldn’t there be newer drivers than that?  Don’t use Windows Update for video drivers, just go right to NVidia’s site.</p>
<p>Lastly, this may just be one of those problems you’ll face when using bleeding-edge tech.  Things like SLI still aren’t common enough to really have the major issues worked out completely.  Maybe try taking one of the cards out and trying with just 1.  If that works, give the extra to me!   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Not sure if it’ll work in this case, but when i couldn’t change any settings on crysis without it crashing, it turned out the problem was my antivirus software.</p>
<p>What you need to do is open your antivirus program and make the folder the game creates in ‘My Documents’ an exception so that it doesn’t freak out when the .exe trys to access your settings which are for some reason stored in said folder.</p>

            <p>Nothing happens, just the thinking circle and mouse pointer like the 64bit. I read that 1.2.1 is for 32 bit only, so once I’m out of class I’m going to try running using only 1.2. Though I highly doubt that’ll correct it.</p>
<p>I’m gonna check out the nVidia forums as well.</p>

            <p>With my new rig, I wanted to get Crysis going on it. Though like other people it seems, I’m having issues with it. I’ve done what seems to have worked for others running it in compatibility modes for XP and Vista in all service pack options, I’ve even tried the NoCD crack that was rumored to work. Updated to 1.2.1 as well.</p>
<p>Though the thing that I’m experiencing that no one else seems to, is I launch the Crysis.exe from my bin64 folder and I get the mouse with the thinking ring and then nothing. Not even a black screen or any resemblance of a boot up. The Crysis64.exe launches, though hits the black screen and then stops entirely. Ctrl+Alt+Dlt out and end the program.</p>
<p>I noticed after I would run the Crysis64.exe a “Game” txt file shows up. I scroll through and it is the diagnostics of my system. Everything reads fine except my GPUs. It shows that they are ‘unknown’. My GPUs are running the latest working drivers as of July 19, 2010. SLI is recognized on the computer and through Speccy.</p>
