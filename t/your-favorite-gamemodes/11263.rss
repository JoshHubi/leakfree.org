<p>Aha, I’ve played maps like that for TFC! There’s the <span class="bbcode-i">heavymachinery</span> series (and a lone map which is Simpsons-themed). Because fallen runners respawn in TFC, a small team of trigger-men is allowed in these.</p>
<p>They can be very fun. TFC allows 4 teams to exist, so some maps have 3 colors of runner representing different difficulty levels: Scout is easy, Sniper is medium, and Civilian (or HW) is hard.</p>

            <p>Been playing it since the eaaaaaarly alpha. Like zero features and fascinated by pretty things early. It’s turned into a beast of a game, some of the best multiplayer I’ve ever had, assuming you get a team that is willing to work together. And your commander isn’t an ass (arrogance is the biggest turn-off to wanting to help out).</p>
<p>The exosuites are amazing x.X</p>

            <p>Yeah, alot like that. Best map was Cabin, there were three(in the original) houses, a garage and a shack. All the survivors randomly spawned in the houses which came pre barricaded with physics doors and bars, and the zombie or zombies (it spawned more starter zombies if there were lots of players) had to break into the houses while the survivors were stacking couches and other things to help defend their house more. Usually yellow house and blue house started with less people, so if you could break those ones down, all the zombies could swarm white house together. The survivors had to kill “all” the zombies, which was a lives countdown. What made it not a good idea to just swarm outside and hunt the starter zombie down is that he was a carrier and could infect survivors, who would turn into zombies a minute or two after an attack.</p>

            <p>I tried Zombie Panic: Source but it was lagging me too badly to play properly… What was its gameplay like?</p>
<p>Was it anything like a zombie mod I encountered in Call of Duty 1?:1. Everybody starts as Hunters</p>
<ol>
<li>One dude becomes a Zombie</li>
<li>Slain Hunters will respawn as Zombies</li>
<li>Timed rounds expire to determine if any Hunters survived to win<br>
I really liked that gamemode. It can be hard if you’re patient-zero, chosen to start recruiting Zombies, but once you surprise a few inept Hunters, the Zombies really pick up momentum.</li>
</ol>

            <p>One of the most neat and unique gamemodes I’ve ever played was a pirate ship mod for Gmod. You get a slow reloading pistol and a sword, and there are two ships. The ships are almost totally destructible, you get cannons and you try and sink the other ship. If you take out their masts, they can’t drive around as well, etc.</p>
<p>Is Zombie Panic still on steam? We should really have a zombie panic night one of these days, I havn’t played that game in forever.</p>

<p>Hahaha, reminds me of a custom TFC Hunted map which was created for a server I frequent.</p>
<p>It’s called ta_killclause…[indent]The Hunted is a blue Santa who gets points for staying alive,<br>
Bodyguards wear santa hats,<br>
Assassin Snipers appear as little penguins,<br>
and there’s a team of Assassin Spies (tranq/knife only, can’t disguise) who appear as snowmen.[/indent]You’d recognize the last two models from Opposing Force’s easter egg weapon.</p>
<p>I love playing as a snowman spy. There are several prop-snowmen around the map which are nearly identical in appearance. If you duck and sit perfectly still along a wall like the prop-snowmen are placed, 85% of enemies will walk by you without noticing the knife/tranq in your snowman hand.</p>
<p>I’ve made bodyguards so paranoid, I watch them shooting rockets at prop-snowmen to see if they bleed. With their backs turned to me.</p>

            <p>Fucking teamsneak in MGO.</p>
<p>One team is the sneaking team and the other is the seeking (I guess) team. Sneaking team only gets a knife and tranq pistol but also have cloak. Other team gets whatever weapons they want but are visible. The object of the game is for the sneaking team to infiltrate the other team’s base and steal their duck/frog statue and take it back to their base while the other team hunts them down and protects the statue. Even though the sneaking team is cloaked, if you just run in the other team sees your knife bouncing in the air as there’s no way to unequip it, and with the statue it’s above your head so you can’t really hide while returning.</p>
<p>Man, it was so much fun. Apparently they’re making another and I hope this mode returns.</p>

            <p>Ahh, fascinating! Blending in with NPCs… I think I’d have fun with that.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a gamemode I coded for Call of Duty, based on Deathmatch spawns. I called it “Purge”, but it could go by a number of other names:</p>
<ol>
<li>On spawn, you’re told to kill a specific player (assigned at random)</li>
<li>[COLOR=‘Lime’]+1 when your target dies[list=A][*][COLOR=‘Lime’]+4 if you killed him</li>
<li>[COLOR=‘Gray’]+ new assignment<br>
[/<em>:m]<br>
[</em>][COLOR=‘Lime’]+1 for killing your assassin[/<em>:m]<br>
[</em>][COLOR=‘Red’]-1 for killing a stranger (!)[/*:m][/list:o]<br>
So the idea was to have players running past eachother without immediately opening fire.</li>
</ol>
<p>I got all of the scoring and notifications working. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to implement a crucial final feature:[indent]I wanted to use the minimap to inform each assassin about their target’s location, as was done in Behind Enemy Lines, to keep people from wandering around aimlessly.[/indent]Yet minimap locations can only be sent by team, and are not individually addressable, so I gave up…</p>

            <p>Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood’s multiplayer. Developed by the same guys that worked on Chaos Theory’s multiplayer, the use of crowds as a mechanic in MP led to a highly masquerade-reliant game that rewarded picking up on subtle cues from player movements rather than a balls out jump from a building to kill a target.</p>
<p>The highest scoring kills were blades in the crowd- the kind of kills I got quite a bit. I was surprisingly good at Brotherhood multiplayer. It’s a shame I had to move not long after I got the game, to a place with excruciatingly shitty internet. I can no longer play because of it.</p>
<p>Depressing.</p>

            <p>Ah yes, Source Forts, that counts! I never got a chance to play that, but it reminds me of a Minecraft-style online game called Ace of Spades.</p>
<p>Ace of Spades usually provides simple capture-the-flag games which allow you to create and destroy blocks. If you want to build a base, you have to do so with enemies walking around.</p>
<p>I recall a large game where both teams were very good at defense. While my dozen-or-so teammates were busy fighting on the surface, I spent at least 10 minutes digging a tunnel straight across the map.  I emerged behind a hill near the enemy flag, told my teammates about its entrance, and watched nonstop capping raise the score from “3-2” to “10-2”.</p>
<p>I have also dug a pit under the enemy resupply tent before, and then buried it.</p>

            <p>I don’t know if this does count but -<br>
I used to play a game called ‘Source Forts’ The aim of the game was to build your base in the first part of the game (you get around 10 mins +)<br>
The Blocks where like… Shield shaped squares and rectangles.<br>
You use your gravity gun to move and freeze the blocks where you wanted them.<br>
The blocks have health too.</p>
<p>So when you are in playing mode, you vs a team and try to break into their base by damaging their blocks and destroying them. (the aim of the game is to capture their ball thing at the back of the base)  its basically CTF.</p>
<p>You can be either combine or human and there are different classes.<br>
(all Half life 2 guns)</p>
<p>Tbh, one of the best dman games ive played.</p>

            <p>Despite enjoying TFC’s CTF for so long, my favorite gamemode of all time has gotta be <span class="bbcode-b">Behind Enemy Lines</span>, found in the first Call of Duty.</p>
<p>In Behind Enemy Lines, the two teams are uneven. It’s easiest to think of them as Hunters &amp; Hunted. At least 60% of players are assigned as Hunters, while the remaining 40% become Hunted. Members of the Hunted team accumulate points by staying alive. The Hunters must kill them.</p>
<p>When a Hunter lands a successful kill, he takes that person’s place on the Hunted team, earning himself the opportunity to accumulate points by staying alive. His victim, meanwhile, respawns as a Hunter. When the round ends, players are scored individually due to the fleeting nature of their loyalties.</p>
<p>I love the variety in play offered by Behind Enemy Lines. Your objective vacillates between destruction and survival. The teams are dynamic yet automatically balanced. It is the Hunted team’s best interest to work together to survive, while their Hunters fight greedily.</p>
<p>Call of Duty provided some extra features, like giving the Hunted players more health (to make survival easier) while hinting at their hideouts (to make hunting less aimless), but the basic mechanism of Behind Enemy Lines is what I’m in love with. It made for some epic last-stands.</p>
<p>How about you?</p>
