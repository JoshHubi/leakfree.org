</aside>
<p>That’s the thing, it’s not just <em>any</em> 4 answer multiple choice question, it says <em>this</em> question. So the numbers in the answer do affect the chance of correctly guessing the answer, because it’s entirely dependent on guessing the correct answer <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">to this particular question</span>.</span></p>

<p>Thanks Orpheon. Also, the Monty Hall paradox seems to make sense… I think. As the host knows which door has the car and the goat, he opens a door with the goat, meaning there is probably a car in the other door (you didnt pick) or he might have picked that door to open… Yeah confusing.</p>
<p>Edit: But wait a sex, surely if you pick 50% you have a 50% chance of being correct, unless the label is lying.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well what messes with people’s heads is that most people would assume that you have a 50% chance of winning after the host opens one door, because there are 2 doors left. So people will just stay with their first gut instinct and not switch because they figure there’s no advantage. But in reality, <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">you should always switch</span></span>, because the other door actually has a 66% chance of having the prize, not 50%. When the host takes away one choice, he doesn’t change the probability of each door winning.</p>
<p>“As Cecil Adams puts it, “Monty is saying in effect: you can keep your one door or you can have the other two doors.” The player therefore has the choice of either sticking with the original choice of door, or choosing the sum of the contents of the two other doors, as the 2/3 chance of hiding the car has not been changed by the opening of one of these doors.” - wikipedia</p>

<p>But since “50%” is only one of four choices, then it should be 25%. But since 25% appears twice out of four choices, then the answer should be 50%…so on and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>See, that’s the bit I don’t get. The numbers in the answer don’t affect the chances of correctly guessing a 4 answer multiple question. Those chances are still 25%. The question is flawed because both A and D are correct. Nothing to do with paradoxes at all. Just someone trying to be clever and failing.</p>

            <p>Well actually it’d be 20%, because there are 5 choices, and dividing 100% across 5 would give you 20%, (<em>head implosion</em> is a choice) so, even if you chose at random it’s no different from an educated guess, you may think you know the answer, but it may be wrong, there fore 20% is the only logical guesstimation for the answer, but it wasn’t an option, therefore A and D are the closest 2 choices, but most would think to chose D because A is a “typical” answer, But then they would think you want them to pick D so they chose A in order to avoid your trap.</p>

<p>How is that a paradox. Orpheon what logic are you using? Im confused.</p>
<p>Also, is the answer to this question no?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, the other possible answer is that there is not enough information to decide. djMDK’s answer is also right, and I’ll explain it. But it’s still a paradox. Sooo let’s see if I can make it simpler.</p>
<p>“If you choose an answer to this question at random what is the chance you will be correct?”</p>
<p>Ok, so the question has four possible answers to choose from. You would normally assume that a multiple choice has only 1 possible answer, correct?<br>
Well, this point you can choose to say, “That’s only an assumption. It’s not explicitly stated how many correct answers there are, so I don’t actually know if there is one correct answer, or two, or three or four. So there isn’t enough information to answer.”</p>
<p>However, if you continue with the assumption that there is only 1 correct answer, then choosing an answer at random should result in a success 25% of the time (1 right answer divided by 4 possible answers = 25% chance of choosing the right answer). So now we look at the answers, and see that both choices A and D say 25%. Here is where things get a little confusing.</p>
<p>Since the answer I got was 25%, and there are 2 choices that say 25%, then my answer should change to 50%, because now the equation is: 2 correct answers divided by 4 possible choices = 50% chance to answer the question correctly. BUT, if I change my answer to B, which is 50%, then in effect I have said, “There is 1 correct answer,” which means the equation has changed back to: 1 correct answer divided by 4 choices = 25% chance to answer correctly. Thus you can’t choose A, B, or D because they contradict each other.</p>
<p>At this point you might want to choose C since that’s the only one that’s left. If there’s no right answer, then the answer is 0% because 0/4 is 0…right? Well, no, because that in itself is an answer, so choosing C again is saying that there is 1 correct answer, and again it becomes 1/4 = 25%. So C is not correct either.</p>
<p>And that’s why it’s a paradox, and that’s why they are all correct and incorrect at the same time.</p>
<p>This one is an interesting head-scratcher, but it’s nowhere near as bad as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the Monty Hall problem</a> because when you figure this question out, it’s curious but it probably won’t bother you. The Monty Hall problem is REALLY bothersome for most people because even when you hear the explanation, it sounds wrong and even impossible, but it’s been proven over and over again that the correct answer is actually correct.</p>
