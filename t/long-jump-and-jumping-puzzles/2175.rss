    <title>Long Jump and Jumping Puzzles</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/long-jump-and-jumping-puzzles/2175</link>
    <description>Cman2k Recently made a post about Jumping Puzzles in the Got a Question Thread, and it prompted an idea concerning the improvement of the Jumping mechanic, more specifically the Long Jump (or Crouch-Jump) Mechanic.

Said Post:
[quote=&quot;cman2k&quot;]
The crouch-jump was essential to HL1 and will be essential to BM.  You&#39;ll encounter some required crouch-jumps in just the first few levels.  

That&#39;s not to say we won&#39;t have some system in to hint the player what they need to do if they don&#39;t get it.  We aren&#39;t trying to confuse people, but we aren&#39;t going to cut it because it&#39;s confusing, we are going to find solutions to make it less confusing.

We have considered removing these, but the bottom line is that this is a game that encourages players to get better at the fancy-jumping stuff.  Cliffside fights and long-jumping not excluded, you need to get better at being able to control your jumping and movement, and the game teaches this on a gradual curve.

Removing crouch-jumping would just make it more jarring later when you have to do even more complex jumping, which does happen.

The only other option would be to dumb the whole thing down to make it more accessible (ie; easier), which is not something we want to do.  Crazy jumps are part of the game and really add to the drama in some situations, as well as give it that &quot;FPS w/ platformer elements&quot; feel.  Removing crazy jumping would just be a lot more...boring.  Less risk, less reward.

We have sought out other options to this tough.  Sometimes there are alternative paths, for example.  Taking the crazy jump might give you some extra stuff, while taking the easier way might force you to take some fire damage.  That&#39;s a choice you get to discover and make, as a player.

Said Idea:

One thing that Metroid Prime did for its jumping puzzles was to force the camera down slightly when Samus jumped, thus providing a better viewpoint for landing without the player even noticing. (the only reason I noticed was because some reviewer mentioned it).

Obviously as this is a PC FPS, the player can look down themselves, but perhaps you can change the FOV when Gordon long jumps to sort of mimic an adrenaline rush. The view would become slightly more fish-eye so the landing spot becomes at least partially visible even if the player isn&#39;t looking directly at it. This also would show the player that they have indeed accomplished the long jump, as the effect wouldn&#39;t happen on a regular jump. If you really wanted to take it to the extreme, you could even mute the sound a little while gordon is in the air and add a heartbeat or harsh breathing noise.

In Summation, the suggestion consists of the following key elements:

-The fish-eye-esque FOV increase upon the successful initiation of the crouch-jump
  Gameplay advantages:
          -The Player receives an indication that they have successfully initiated the long jump
          -The Player is able to see his target landing location with greater ease
  Cosmetic Advantages:
           -Hightens tension at a moment in gameplay where tension is desirable

-The muting of external sound effects (such as enemy fire) accompanied by a sound effect such as harsh breathing or heartbeat.
   Cosmetic Advantages: 
           -Same as above, with enhancements

Just in case anyone is confused about what an increase in FOV actually means, here are some demonstration pics:
[url=&#39;https://www.hellblazer.cc/upload/uploads/fov_75.png&#39;]FOV 75[/url] (default FOV),  [url=&#39;https://www.hellblazer.cc/upload/uploads/fov_90.png&#39;]FOV 90[/url]

As some people prefer a higher FOV, the effect could perhaps apply a standard number of FOV steps, such as 15. So if the player enjoys playing Source games with FOV 90, the effect would temporarily increase the FOV to, say, 105.</description>

</aside>
<p>If you’re suggesting it, this happens in the first Half-Life whenever you jump and land at a different height than when you were when you initially jump, such as jumping off the desk in Anomalous Materials where the guard is recovering Gordon’s files. Just a slight wiggle might not be bad, but if it does that traditional rightwards jolt every time, it may be annoying. Maybe duck-jumps could soften the jolt effect.</p>
<p>Unless you were already talking about it.</p>

<p>Just remember your time in the hazard course. When you are required to climb through some pipes Gina calls it a duck jump. Later on when you get the long jump module she calls it a long jump.</p>

<p>same for the field of view option… in half-life 1 you were able to individually adjust your FOV per a console command called default_fov “90” (default…)<br>
i always used default_fov “110”… and i know very many players who use a individual FOV… so… PLEASE… please keep it… for gods sake… (:</p>

            <p>Yeah, that’s what threw off my initial argument on the subject, since I didn’t realize he was only referring to long jumping.<br>
I think that he felt that jumping and then crouching in the air would actually be referred to as “jump crouching” since you have to press the jump button first and then crouch, and so that would mean the long jump would be “crouch jumping”</p>
<p>It’s still far more clear just to call it long jumping and skip the confusion entirely.</p>

            <p>There is a fundamental difference between a crouch-jump and a long-jump (crouch+jump).</p>
<p>The OP and Ram are both talking about the long jump, despite the OP sometimes referring to it as a “crouch-jump” and quoting me where I am in fact referring to the crouch-jump.</p>
<p>The crouch-jump is where you jump and then crouch, magically lifting up your legs and letting you fit into a smaller space while you are in the air.  The necessity for crouch-jumping is not being removed from the game.</p>
<p>The long jump has been reviewed, tweaked and revamped quite a bit.  We want it to be intuitive and easier to control.  We have already tried most of the stuff suggested here, but we aren’t set on what the final solution will be ourselves until after more playtesting.</p>

<p>unless he’s referring to the crouch jump, in which case I most whole heartedly disagree to all points including sound effects.</p>

            <p>I rarely miss long jumps due to not being able to see the landing. I also use the long jump constantly as a quicker alternative to regular movement. To me it’s either going only be useful for it’s aesthetic value, or it’ll hinder my jumping ability. It’s an interesting idea, but I don’t think it’s right for everyone.</p>

            <p>This is actually a good suggestion. Although the whole ‘fov and screen effect change to let the player know they successfully long jumped’ thing seems a bit redundant, as it was usually easy to tell you successfully long jumped since you were <span class="bbcode-i">flying through the air.</span>  do like it, but please, no screen effects. I’m fine with the FOV change, though.</p>

            <p>I’m happy with the FOV changes. Really, it’d be great. And maybe a “whoosh” sound too, but not very loud, or it’d get repetitive.</p>

            <p>As long as the sound isn’t LOUD then a small hydrolic piston type noise wouldn’t be unacceptable, provided it was only for long jumps and not for regular jumps. Then again, the long jump module is apparently worn on the back, so rather than pistons it probably should use a jet blast noise or something. Though it might just be a battery pack that provides additional power to the assisted movement of the legs… in which case I’d go back to the piston noise.</p>

<p>And as for claiming that the devs don’t have time to implement something like this… they have freed themselves of a public deadline, so for all we know they have all the time in the world, haha.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’d still like to believe that the devs are still trying to get it out asap. Also your statement assumes they EVER felt bound by the public deadline, which I don’t really think was the case, that’s just what they were shooting for. As a result, if they were turning stuff down due to time constraints, then things will still get turned down due to time constraints.</p>

<p>As for fixing something that isn’t broken… Gameplay improvements are just that: Improvements. You wouldn’t call Half Life’s gameplay broken, but you couldn’t call it perfect either.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The question is if this would actually BE an improvement or not. There are a lot of people who feel that iron sights would be an improvement, but that doesn’t mean it should be in Black Mesa. This might just be me, but I’m fairly certain that a majority of the goal is not just to improve Half Life, but to make it consistent with the rest of the half life series.<br>
Though if you’re talking about making this a feature that only occurs when you use the long jump module,(my original argument had been based on the idea that this would occur during regular jumps as well) then that might not be too bad. That feature was never used in the rest of the Half Life series, so there’s more leeway to that. Having the fov expand during long jumps doesn’t sound too difficult to implement (comparatively), wouldn’t feel inconsistent with HL2 or the episodes, and would actually probably help you spot your landing better while remaining overt.<br>
I’d actually be a little surprised if this wasn’t already implemented.</p>
