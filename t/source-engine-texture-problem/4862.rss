    <title>Source Engine Texture problem...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-engine-texture-problem/4862</link>
    <description>I&#39;m creating some custom textures for my mod, and I&#39;ve come across a problem. One os the texture I need is glitching. What&#39;s happening, is as I get further away from the texture, it has this weird effect, but it dissapears when I&#39;m right next to the texture... Look:

And this is the text in the .vmt:
[code]
&quot;LightmappedGeneric&quot;
{
	&quot;$basetexture&quot; &quot;lobby/blackmesa_concrete_novent&quot;
	&quot;$surfaceprop&quot; &quot;concrete&quot;
}
[/code]

I doubt it&#39;s the .vmt, because I have some other textures using that same thing.It had a normal map, but I took that outta the material earlier because I thought that might be the problem, but it wasn&#39;t. Can anybody help? Thanks ahead.</description>

<p>Also, how do I get that chrome effect? If you look at the Lambda core media you’ll se what I mean.</p>
