    <title>Physics were messed up when...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/physics-were-messed-up-when/11643</link>
    <description>Well I don&#39;t know exactly how it happened.

It was the first time I used the &quot;Hivehand&quot; weapon, I was in the level when you must reactivate the cooling system of a nuclear reactor... I fired against a wall, there was some objects near me (like those chromed nitrogen tanks, or whatever is inside), close enough to be touched by the &quot;flying bullets&quot;, and they started to float like there was almost no gravity. I though it was a feature of the weapon, but then I realized every objects in the map had extremely weird physics!

Restarted the game / loaded my latest quick save, and the bug was gone hopefully  :slight_smile: 

Sadly I cannot reproduce it, but it was funny  :slight_smile:
