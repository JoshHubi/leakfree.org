<p>Hey, if too much gets cut, I’m sure Text would always be happy to make a ‘Xen Uncut’ mod. XD</p>

            <p>We also have absolutely no idea how they’ve been working on it, or how far they’d progressed before the initial release, so there is no point in debating how much longer it will take. We simply have no clue.</p>

            <p>Remaking things can sometimes be harder than making stuff from scratch, because you have to be careful to get it jusssst right. Whereas making something from scratch you are open to doing what you want from the start. So the fact that they are changing a lot does not have to mean it will take longer.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree there have to be some jumping puzzles involved.</p>
<p>When I practiced using the long jump module after getting it I could help but note that the sound it made made me think of RCS rockets (the adjustment rockets say on the orbiter).</p>
<p>This opens to me the possibility that on Xen it might just act a lot more like the kind of jetpacked spacesuit seen in multiple films of the SF variety. If that’s the case it opens a whole new level to the Xen gamplay that could be all kinds of awesome.</p>

            <p>I will never understand why everyone hates on the Xen platforming, the manta ray part yes that’s absolute bullshit but the first and last platforming parts I find quite fun, maybe they can speed up the moving platforms, make them closer together, or even give each of them different movement patterns, whatever they do, I’m sure it’ll be great  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Lack of Xen imagery during resonance cascade is very suggestive, along with lack of any leaks and so on.</p>
<p>My bet is that they are still on a concept stage, or at most at orange-mapping stage and starting to flesh it out.</p>
<p>It took about 3 years to get contemporary BMS finished, and Xen is said to be bigger than before, so my guess is we might see Pluto up close before Xen is out (2015).</p>

            <p>My estimate is that it will take about 6-8 months if they keep at a good pace. That’s just long enough that releasing now wouldn’t be stupid, and also a decent amount of time to get a lot done. I don’t see it taking more than a year tops though. And definitely not before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Well, then there’s also deathmatch to consider, which doesn’t sound like it’s gotten tooo far yet, lol:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

            <p>Yeah, I asked in Got a Question and the answer was “not this year” or something to that effect.</p>
<p>I doubt very much it will take until 2014. My guess is early-mid 2013. I doubt it will be any later than next summer.</p>

<p>Right, but unfortunately most of the people here are too lazy to read the resources the developers have been so kind to give them and instead post about wanting it now, like they are Veruca Salt in a chocolate factory.</p>

            <p>I’d wager mid to late 2013 at most. Though honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if it went into 2014, as well.</p>

</aside>
<p>Uhm, my money’s not. I’m almost definite that one of the BM team members said not to expect it within this year. Also, if they were going to release them so close to each other, then why wouldn’t they just wait to release a finished product? After 7-8 years of waiting, I doubt they’d worry about losing a fanbase within a few more months.</p>
