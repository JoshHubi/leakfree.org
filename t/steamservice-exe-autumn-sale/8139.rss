    <title>SteamService.exe Autumn Sale</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steamservice-exe-autumn-sale/8139</link>
    <description>So with the Steam summer sale going on I&#39;ve bought three things
GTA IV (with Liberty City Stories)
Bulletstorm
The Polynomial
Now, with GTA IV and Bulletstorm, I launch either of them and get this:
![SteamService.jpg|690x500](upload://93tsHkeYq5jMwYFr7ncQjUKxIDq.jpeg)
I&#39;ve uninstalled and reinstalled Steam (saving the Steamapps folding, obviously), used Start&gt;Run to actually run and see if SteamService wanted to open, and there are no other accounts on my computer except mine. Thoughts, anyone?

Edit: A friend of mine has already sent the info of the problem to Steam Support and to /r/Steam. Any help here would be grand as well</description>

            <p>I remember having the same error message with a different exe sometime in the past and found out that renaming the exe solved the issue. It seems there was a problem with the length of the name of the exe and that, apparently, it exceeded the length designated in the program itself. I simply renamed it to setup.exe and it solved my problem. It was a weird solution, but one that worked for me.</p>

            <p>Folder Permissions. there are other ways of fixing this problem, rather then going straight to the folder and trying to change permissions, search on google, how, or fiddle with folder permissions a bit</p>

            <p>But it’s not. It took me a total of two days to reinstall everything and nothing’s changed. Still the same errors. Feck.</p>

            <p>Do you have Windows Home?  I believe only XP Professional had the simple file sharing option (and Home doesn’t) though I have no idea why Microsoft includes/excludes certain features from certain versions, especially important security settings.</p>
<p>In any event, glad to see it’s working at the moment  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Pffft, alright, y’all. Deleted the content of both Bulletstorm and GTA IV. Maybe it was just something with the download, cause the other game I purchased (Polynomial) works fine. Might have to wait another day or so to test it again.</p>
