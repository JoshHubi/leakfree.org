    <title>Insane range on the crowbar?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/insane-range-on-the-crowbar/13902</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just a perspective problem or it&#39;s intentional, but I find that I&#39;m able to stand about a foot away from an enemy or wall and I can hit it. I know in the previous version of this mod, you had to be right up in the enemy&#39;s face to hit them with the crowbar. The crowbar also doesn&#39;t hit exactly where it should. It usually hits to the left of the reticle, which doesn&#39;t make sense.</description>

            <p>As long as the crowbar still goes into crazy flailing thwacking mode when hitting stuff, I’m happy.  I love how that aspect was preserved in BM.</p>

            <p>When we ported all of the weapon configurations to the dmx format (from cfg), it looks like the Crowbar got a bit screwed up, and some of its SP and MP values got mixed up. I have fixed this and it will be updated in the next patch. Its range has been reduced (from 76 to 32), its fire rate was reduced (0.2 --&gt; 0.25), and a few other things fixed.</p>

            <p>Allow me to address something that bothers me in-game.</p>
<p>Why is the player’s vision going way off after I keep hitting something with the crowbar for a long period of time? What is the point of this?</p>
