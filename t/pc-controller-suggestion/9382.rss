    <title>PC Controller Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pc-controller-suggestion/9382</link>
    <description>I was looking into getting a controller for my PC for some time now and with Big Picture mode this seems like a good occasion.

Since it looks like for now only Xbox360 Controllers, the [url=&#39;https://www.logitech.com/en-us/gaming/controllers/wireless-gamepad-f710&#39;]Logitech F710[/url] and [url=&#39;https://www.razerzone.com/minisite/onza&#39;]Razer Onza[/url] are supported, I wondered which one to get.
I was always a fan of the Playstation Controllers and had one for my PC once, but the motionjoy driver was a pain in the ass sometimes and the controller somehow broke...

How are your experiences with these controllers, which one would you recommend for PC gaming? The F710 looks nice on the feature side being able to switch between direct input and xinput, but I have read it has some bad dead zones? The Razer Onza looks also interesting, I&#39;d just wish it was wireless.</description>

<p>I’ve got the wired version of the Logitech 710 and wish I didn’t. While the controller itself is great value for money and works really well, some games don’t work well with it (<span class="bbcode-i">almost all work great, just a handful don’t</span>).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thanks for the info, I guess I will avoid the F710 then…</p>

<p>The 360 controller is a good PC controller but the d-pad is garbage. If you need a game that <span class="bbcode-b">requires</span> it I would recommend against using it. You may want to look at motion joy drivers again as the latest versions do work much better than before. Lastly if you already own a PS2 you might want to look at something like <a href="https://www.dealextreme.com/p/ps2-to-ps3-controller-adapter-convert-cable-black-56393" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>. I purchased them as a cheep way to get 4 players on my ps3 but they work very well in windows (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/GmWv7.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">win7 x64 will automatically find the driver online</a>).</p>
<p>EDIT: but as of writing the ps2 controller isn’t detected by steam (as far as I can tell)</p>
<p>EDIT2: but motion joy fixed hat</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like to play old fighting games like Street Fighter or Garou from time to time and prefer to play these with the d-pad instead of the stick somehow, maybe I’m just more used to it.<br>
I actually don’t have a playstation but I could get a cheap wireless PS3 controller. Too bad it broke, I would have given it another try with motionjoy, it was really nice while it worked. The most troublesome thing for me with motionjoy was setting up multiple bluetooth controllers, but it was nice that bluetooth otherwise worked quite well.</p>

<p>The Razer onza Tournament Edition is what I use and recommend. The adjustable thumbsticks and extra remap shoulder buttons are the most useful thing, especially for PC games where there is no standard way to handle sensitivity. The XYAB buttons are designed to click like a mouse and are illuminated.</p>
<p>They have better rumble motors and thumbsticks than the regular 360 controller and the cord is gorgeous. The entire item emits a delicious rubbery smell that lasts for about a month.</p>
<p>There’s no reason not to own one of these over a standard issue 360 gamepad, considering they cost the same</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>At first I also thought the Onza might be a perfect match. I like the fact that it has mechanical buttons and the other features also sound really neat. But I saw a lot of comments on the German and US Amazon page from people whose Onza developed defects after a few weeks of use. But I could just give it a shot and return it if I have any issues. For how long did you have your Onza?</p>

I also guess even the newer models wouldn’t work with Big Picture mode for now?</p>

            <p>It’s a better design period. The ps3 controller is an archaic mess. The dual sticks were slapped on in the last minute in response to the n64 stick, and it shows. The crutch of the design is based on an afterthought. The 360 controller actually had R&amp;D put into it. Mostly because they royally fucked it up the first time.</p>

<p>Tell that to my hands after playing a 2 hour session of GT5. I don’t know if it’s because my hands are a bit too big for the dualshock or because the analog triggers are a piece of shit, but my hands get a bit cramped after playing GT5 for more than an hour. However, playing GRID or some other racing game on the PC with the 360, my hands are always good to go, even after a 2 hour session.</p>

            <p>Why the fuck hasn’t someone made a two stick Dreamcast controller? I’d be all over that shit. Better yet, driver and adapter to get the Dreamcast Mouse + Keyboard to work. The Dreamcast had a rock solid keyboard.</p>
<p>As for the 360/PS3 controller debate, I use both interchangeably.</p>
<p>The 360 has the majority of my shooters, but I do own Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 on both machines, as well as Final Fantasy XIII, so doing a comparison between controllers for shooters and RPGs might be interesting.</p>

            <p>Fair enough. I suppose it’s merely a matter of preference. Plus Nintendo was the first to swap the location of the left analog stick before Microsoft picked it up. You know, with the GCN controller. If my GCN/PS2/Xbox to USB adaptor worked correctly, I’d be using my GCN controller for specific PC games.</p>

            <p>Btw, I always thought of the positioning of the sticks on PS controllers as more rational - 360 ones virtually do not change shit and feel like useless showboating to stand out from the crowd instead. As for being loose - I have an opposite gripe with 360 being too stiff.</p>

<p>Held it on several occasions and never got into this ‘comfortable’ bullshit. It is bulky and fat.<br>
Always used my sixaxis with motioninjoy drivers - works perfectly and wireless. You can even map it to XBOX360 setup in the later versions - so compatibility is never a problem. Even though they could do with PS1’s longer handles.</p>
<p>+No switching batteries, normal d-pad and buttons are actually analog.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve never been real privy to Playstation controllers, especially with the analog sticks.  I have a PS2 myself and I’ve played through several RPGs and GTA San Andreas extensively, and the pad still bugs me.  The Sixaxis is an improvement, but the sticks are still the same. Too loose for my liking. That isn’t to say that the Sixaxis controllers don’t make a valid option for PC gaming as they support the drivers right out of the box, unlike Microsoft’s wireless controllers with the Charge and Play attachments, which do not. I specifically purchased a wired 360 controller for the purpose of playing PC games as it was the most economical choice given its duel purpose.</p>

<p>Haha no and no, you dick. And X-controller is still fat and fugly despite being slightly less big and stupid than the old one.</p>

            <p>I use a Logitech Rumblepad 2. It’s cheap, reliable &amp; all the buttons work perfectly. The only problem is most newer games always assume that if you’re using a gamepad then it’s an Xbox 360 controller, so sometimes buttons end up mapped totally wrong. The Logitech F310 &amp; F510 are basically the same thing with 360-styled buttons &amp; presumably alleviates that problem. I’d only really go with the F710 if you actually think you’ll be using it far enough away to justify it, as wireless controllers tend to chew up batteries pretty damn fast.</p>

<p>They’re pretty shit when you want to play an platformer. Playing old games with an emulator on a keyboard just feels wrong after you’ve used a gamepad.</p>

            <p>I use a PS3 controller myself, I get around the support problem by making my computer think it’s a 360 controller using the DS3 Tool download. Works wonders.</p>

            <p>I don’t know, I find that with the dualshock the fingers I don’t use start to hurt a bit after an hour or so because of the uncomfortable positions. With the 360 controller, I noticed that my fingers are in more comfortable positions under the controller and can play for hours without any discomfort.</p>
<p>It’s also better for racing games. Sometimes I wish I could use the 360 controller on the PS3 to play Gran Turismo.</p>

<p>Held it on several occasions and never got into this ‘comfortable’ bullshit. It is bulky and fat.<br>
Always used my sixaxis with motioninjoy drivers - works perfectly and wireless. You can even map it to XBOX360 setup in the later versions - so compatibility is never a problem. Even though they could do with PS1’s longer handles.</p>
<p>+No switching batteries, normal d-pad and buttons are actually analog.</p>

            <p>I have the wired 360 controller. It suits my needs well. I used to have the wireless one, but the transceiver/whatever thing would stop receiving and eventually died.</p>

            <p>I’ve got the wired version of the Logitech 710 and wish I didn’t. While the controller itself is great value for money and works really well, some games don’t work well with it (<span class="bbcode-i">almost all work great, just a handful don’t</span>).</p>
