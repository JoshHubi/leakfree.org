    <description>None of these are game breaking though.But here is some bugs that caused me to reload a saved game.In the spinning elevator.If you get stuck somewhere the elevator will go down and will not go up anymore.Also the part when the 2 scientist&#39;s go into the shaft or thing.You can climb it up and see what is inside there, which is a hall of mirrors.Nothing too serious.</description>
