    <title>Black Mesa Desktop Wallpaper</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-desktop-wallpaper/1444</link>
    <description>I was wondering if there was anyone here that would be generous enough to make some [i]*new*[/i] dektop wallpapers. The ones I have (including all of the ones from this site) have become somewhat stale, and I&#39;d appreciate something fresh.

Some of you gentlemen and ladies are very talented and have better artistic style than I do. I&#39;m also talking about wallpaper that is something more elaborate than just plastering the logo on a screen shot.

I guess asking for a couple new screens of the game from the devs to make wallpaper from, would be a bit of a stretch. So I guess if it&#39;s possible to blend screen shots or trailer scenes or even just the logo on concept art would be cool.

Thanks in advance.</description>
