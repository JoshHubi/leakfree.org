    <title>Flashlight dramatically reduces FPS, only in certain areas.</title>

    <description>Hi,

Lemme just first say - GREAT FUCKIN&#39; JOB DEVS! Amazing work recreating the original Half Life!

However, I am running into an infuriating issue, by all accounts I should be able to run this with Max settings, and not have any performance issues.  My specs are as follows:

Core 2 Duo E8400 Overclocked to 3.6ghz (perfectly stable)
4GB RAM
GeForce 570 GTX

Every other modern game I throw at it runs beautifully.  

From the get go, I noticed that the FPS for this was a bit low, but I was able to live with it 20 - 30fps isn&#39;t the greatest, but perfectly playable. I have everything cranked as high as it goes, and am running the game at 2048x1152 (my monitor has an odd native resolution).

What gets annoying is that, every now and then I will aim the flashlight at some random spot in a mostly empty room, and the framerate drops down to 10 or less, which is odd, cause there is no action going on on the screen, just an empty room-ish.  Thinking maybe dynamic lighting was the problem, I disabled all of those settings, but the issue persists.

Is there any sort of technical information I need to provide (a log file or something) to help out the devs? 

Alternatively, if someone knows of a quick and easy fix, I&#39;d be very appreciative.

Thanks!</description>
