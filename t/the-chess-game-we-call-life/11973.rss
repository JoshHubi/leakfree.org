    <description>think for a second, life is unpredictable but some how we can find or predict minor changes based on events. now think some more on how if one of the events never happened how would everything change. what if you never existed how would that effect the world while most of use my self included can say it will not think some more as it will, you are a cog in a machine that accepts all cogs for all places each one gives it a different function even if its a minor change in function.

now for the point of this topic, think of one thing you did the day you read this post even, now think of how things would be different if you hadn&#39;t  done that one thing, some of you would be surprised at the outcome or possible out comes of one event.

(example, the train of thought for this topic was derailed by my cat, if my cat hadn&#39;t gotten my attention this would be longer.)</description>

            <p>Pretty much anything can be made in a dream by taking even individual pieces of objects from your memory and combining them to make things you <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> you’ve never seen before.</p>

            <p>Dreams draw mostly from your own memories, but it’s still entirely possible for completely new things to arise within them. I once had a dream where I fought my way through a hoard of undead dinosaurs using a pair of antique pistols in order to escape a vacuum-sealed mine.</p>
<p>I only wish I knew what part of my mind that one came from.</p>
<p>Edit: And I would like to polite deny the assertion that dreams can predict the future.</p>

            <p>you can be surprised what dreams can do, lets say you had a child hood friend that you haven’t seen sense you where 10 you can dream about them 10 years after that and know exactly what they look like in the here and now. I could use 3 examples for this but do to the nature of dreams and the fact no one here knows me none of them would be worth the pixels in the text.</p>
<p>dreams can do the following but no one knows why<br>
1.show the future<br>
2.show the present in another location<br>
3.give clues to a event you are in<br>
4. remind of things long lost<br>
5.just be plane strange<br>
6.show something that no one knows aka eureka moments</p>
<p>I know putting dreams in a descriptive line like that does nothing as they show a lot more… let me put it this way every dream be it a nightmare or the best one ever has a meaning or two, thoughs meanings may be interrupted in many ways but are usually found when events happen.</p>

            <p>Statistically speaking, similar looking people do exist. But she likely doesn’t.<br>
Though that reminds me of a dream I had a while back… man, that girl and I loved each other so much.<br>
Her workplace was a pretty nicely designed lab, too.</p>

            <p>While we’re still on the topic of dreams, I had a very intriguing dream the night before saturday.</p>
<p>In this dream I had a summer job where I and a few others where shaping boats of icebergs, which by some reason float in a lake, with ice picks and spades. We also used these way too small inflatable dinghies.<br>
Just as expected I fell into the water, it was freezing, and I got picked up by a boat with an outboard motor. Those were apparently used for just that purpose. There was a girl who drove that boat and she and I then spent a lot of time together and I felt so carefree and happy during this part of the dream.</p>
<p>The part of this that confuse me is that I’ve never seen this girl before, or atleast I can’t recall if I have. She had hazel eyes, a round face and nose and shoulder-length hair.<br>
This isn’t really what I usually like, I’ve always been weak for dark eyes but the rest, no. Round noses in particulary, I usually prefer something with a little bit more shape. Sharper, and with a smooth upward arc.<br>
Now I wonder if this girl exist or if she’s a creation of my dreams. And if she do exist, where?</p>

            <p>I don’t normally dream. I have frequent nightmares though, in which I often die saving someone.<br>
Man this thread is so derailed. But atleast it’s an interesting derailing, not just a ton of trolling and shit posting.</p>
<p>Oh, and I do believe déjà vu doesn’t exist as we perceive it. It’s merely one eye picking up and storing Information before the other. When the other eyes info arrives, you experience “deja vu” where you feel as if you’ve already seen your surroundings in your past.<br>
Note: I said that cause pyro said déjà vu and that suddenly popped into my mind.</p>

            <p>Dreams in general are a can of worms to open up.<br>
This past year and a half of dreams I’ve found to be much darker in content compared to what I usually expect, as well as containing some sort of progressing plotline I can never seem to remember until I’m dreaming again.</p>
<p>Yet despite my long involvement with that, I still find it relatively easier to analyze other’s dreams as opposed to mine. +Avoidance</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>that’s just a run of mill nightmare, wonder what happened to trigger it though.</p>
<p>here’s something for you.</p>
<p>my dreams have 2 themes finding something that isn’t there and hiding something that isn’t real. example finding a store that sells potions in a mall once leave the store it turns into a clothing store… another one was me hiding some toys in a demintional rift but never finding them again… ok that one was only partially a dream aka can’t find what I hid in the dream.</p>
<p>thing is every one of the dreams like this is connected and in the same realm, dreams are random and according to things I have read remembering them is rare and remembering ones that connect is rarer. mainly because ones that connect are rarer.</p>
<p>by the way reason I am ranting on this topic is I can’t sleep, lay down brain activates, sit at computer it deactivates or goes into over drive… hate being a thinker some times.</p>

            <p>I had a dream the other day; in it we were on vacation in I think Ecuador. Some guy kidnapped my little sister and was torturing her to force her to work for him. This was completely legal there, apparently, in my dream. I don’t remember much about it, but we rescued her somehow and afterwards she wrote some really creepy poetry about needles and fire.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s a vision or anything, but still, dreams can be really fucked up sometimes.</p>

            <p>Basically, it all comes down to persistence and patience. I was rejected fifteen times by thirteen different people before I actually found someone willing to give it a shot with me. (Yes, I counted.)</p>

            <p>^ With horror stories like that, I think I’m just going to wait until we invent holodecks to try my hand at romance.</p>

            <p>^ Yup, been there. I remember drawing a floor plan of a friend’s house from memory and drew waypoints to try to get a girl I liked alone during a party to talk to her about how I felt. Naturally, I got rejected. First in a long line of them.</p>

            <p>Knives are amazing, albeit dangerous when put into the joke above. Also, saying something took me months of thinking and revising. And it was about 3 sentences long in the end. I may have been overly formal with my thoughts.</p>

            <p>Well, keep your chin up. And if not, look closely at the ship’s deck you’re standing on. My shoes are on there too.<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]Except for the saying things. I’m a coward and I won’t get another chance for months.</p>
<p>Also, knives are fun. :retard:</p>

            <p>Hahaha actually, that was a joke between me and my band. That or she’s fond of blades <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Edit: Yeah, probably. I’m sure this’ll wear off in time, I’m too logical to ruin my life over it. I don’t take rejection easily is all, and some other more complicated emotions are involved. Ha, this situation is funny. I’m getting support from black mesa community forums. Never saw this coming, it’s the Internet.</p>
