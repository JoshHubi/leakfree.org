<p>Yeah, I’ve got it in my EP2 case. I think I bought it off steam as well for some reason though. I honestly don’t think it matters which version of HL you play; I’ve just gone for Goldsource because I love the feel of a REAL 90s shooter.</p>

<li>Yeah, a pattern is really hard, c1a0, c1a2, c1a3, c1a4, c2a1.</li>
<li>The only HL(mod) to ever crash for me is HL Rally. I’d like to see the actual game crash for anyone.</li>
<li>Why would you like skins? How?</li>
<li>Compared to the amount of active AG /  HLDM players, thats nothing.</li>
<li>No, you don’t need to restart anything if you use the -dev startup command.</li>

            <p>Really? That’s interesting; I might have bought that version if I had known.</p>
<p>Anyone else have the CD version of Half Life?<br>
Mine broke some time back, but I remember getting the source version because I thought the steam would be the same as the disk, which wouldn’t solve my resolution problem.</p>
<p>Then again, my memory sucks, there might not have been a resolution problem to begin with.</p>

            <p>I’ve beaten the Steam HL at 1920x1200, so yes, it supports HD resolutions.</p>

            <p>Why waste time learning the HL1 maps when the Source version does it for you? Hell, most of the stuff you listed is opinion. Just because HL1 never crashed for you doesn’t mean it doesn’t crash as much for others. Just because you don’t skin doesn’t mean someone else does. Just because you can’t find a server on HLDMS doesn’t mean someone else can’t. I don’t have a rebuttal on the cheats thing. The only thing that’s actually fact is that the original works in all resolutions.</p>

<p>You’re being ridiculous.</p>
<p>After I played Half Life from my CD for the first time, I played source ever since.<br>
Why? Because it’s got chapter select; it crashes less; easier to install skins; still active multiplayer community; automatically gives you more npcs in Gmod; easier to use cheats; fits my monitor better; etc, etc.</p>
<p>Don’t act like the game is bad just because it’s different. It’s not like they George Lucas’d the thing and removed parts of the game and drastically changed parts of the game – it has plenty of advantages.</p>
