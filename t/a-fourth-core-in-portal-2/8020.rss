    <title>A fourth core in Portal 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-fourth-core-in-portal-2/8020</link>
    <description>Ok, me and my friend Fireeye (youtube) discovered this: 
You know in these two glass cubes containing a lot of corrupted cores just before the final battle ween you and Wheatly? Look in the claw, and you&#39;ll see another core whith a white &quot;iris&quot; that sends a glow to the other cores. So, now, if it allready were in the claw, why didn&#39;t GLaDOS use it first? Why did she drop it to pick up the Space Core instead??? The only logic answer is that the white core wasn&#39;t corrupted and wouldn&#39;t do a shit to Wheatly.

EDIT: With Wheatly it should be the fifth core...</description>

</aside>
<p>It’s because you refuse to acknowledge any of the points that we’re making.  You make a post containing a theory that might be called outlandish at best, then gloss over all the posts where we provide contradictory evidence, then restate your theory… rinse, lather, repeat.</p>
<p>So, <span class="bbcode-i">acknowledge my point</span> when I say that that particular core is either broken or minimally corrupted.  Otherwise, why would GLaDOS not have used it?</p>
<p>The whole point of the boss battle was to corrupt Wheatley <span class="bbcode-i">as quickly as possible</span>, because there are fifteen minutes until the facility is engulfed in a nuclear fireball - and even less time before Wheatley kills Chell with neurotoxin.  GLaDOS is a computer, and computers are great at coming up with the most efficient combination of actions to complete a specific task.  If she sends out a core that’s only, just to pull out a number, 5% corrupted, then she has to wait for Chell to figure out Wheatley’s new defense (because, remember, he changed it each time) and hit him with another bomb before she can send out another one.  And it take <span class="bbcode-i">precious minutes</span> for Chell to hit Wheatley with a bomb.</p>
<p>So, if there’s a core in the claw already, like yours, and it’s 5% corrupted, then GLaDOS is going to drop it and pick up one that’s 30% corrupted instead, because that’s going to corrupt Wheatley a lot <span class="bbcode-i">faster</span>.</p>

            <p>Because the point of using the cores was because they all were defective/corrupted, we were suposed to use them to corrupt Wheatly enough to be able to replace him with GLaDOS.</p>

            <p>Earlier in the game, there were some turrets that moved and talked too on that conveyor belt that were deemed defective and destroyed by GLaDOS/Wheatley.<br>
You don’t make a deal out of that (“OMG why didn’t it use those turrets… they worked!”)<br>
So what’s the big deal and difference between those deemed-defective-but-still-working turrets and that deemed-defective-but-still-working core?</p>

            <p>See previous post: it’s only minimally corrupted, Chell is having bombs launched at her, there are fifteen minutes to complete nuclear meltdown, GLaDOS wants to get the job done as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Also, as noted, just because it’s moving around doesn’t mean it’s alive, or if it’s alive, that it’s functional.  Go watch a video of Terry Schiavo.</p>

All of the four cores were actually functional, and she just threw away the Flashlight Core without thinking twice!</p>

            <p>I think that was the initial problem, that it was really dumb. The intelligent people in this thread (such as yourself) figured that they wouldn’t have to explain why it’s such a stupid idea, so they never really did until recently. Evidently Vampire needed the explanation though.</p>

            <p>The core was there simply to show you a glimpse of what will be next. And the flashlight is on for no particular reason. It’s simply a prop that serves absolutely no purpose. And I do believe everybody has read your post before replying.</p>

            <p>No it’s not, I understand that now. I’ve been pissed off because everytime I start a new thread, everyone just makes a fool out of me… When I post something that’s too long for you to read, you complain about it without even reading what it is. So my anger blinds me and hides the logic. I was just trying to say that the flashlight couldn’t be like the car lamp that I imagined, the one that doesn’t exist, because that would turn on the other core’s flashlights too. So I was just asking what the core was there for.</p>

<p>Someone said that the flashlight was like a car lamp, they blink when a car is brokened. If that’s so, the other cores should also have their flashlight on. But I know that I won’t make any sence to you, since you aristocrats are blinded by your idea of being better then everyone else because you posted more posts then them…</p>

<p>the car lamp on a broken car doesn’t automatically turn on, but it <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> get stuck on, just like the flashlight was coincidentally stuck on for that core only, while the same thing didn’t happen to the other cores. is it really that hard to understand?</p>

<p>I said it.<br>
but you know, I said it because I just wanna give an example that the headlamps don’t have to be turned off if the car’s broken. And also, they don’t have to be on, it’s depended on how much damage it took.</p>

<p>Nobody ever said that a car’s headlights come on when it’s broken.  That’s really dumb, and besides, how would you engineer a car to turn its headlights on when it breaks?  If you have any rudimentary knowledge of technology, you know that that’s really dumb.</p>
<p>This one core happened to break in such a way that its lamp came on.  Either that, or it’s minimally corrupted.  When you have Wheatley firing bombs at Chell in the main room, GLaDOS is logically going to pick cores in such a way that the job gets done <span class="bbcode-i">as quickly as possible</span>.  The longer it takes, the more likely Chell gets hit by a bomb or fails to stop Wheatley before the facility is enveloped in a nuclear fireball (remember, there are only about 15 minutes until nuclear meltdown when Chell and GLaDOS confront Wheatley).</p>
<p>So, even if there are four spots on the body for cores, why would GLaDOS send in a fourth core if three cores are perfectly able to get the job done?  More cores will take more time, and Chell has to get lucky (dodge bombs) for longer.</p>
