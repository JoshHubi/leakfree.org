    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-way-to-download-source-sdk-base-2007-without-steam/14739</link>
    <description>Hi ,

I lost my Source SDK 2007 after installing a new windows on a drive different with the drive i installed the steam.

Since it was too hard with my download speed to download the app and i want to continue playing Black Mesa , i was wondering is there any way to download the Source SDK without steam ?\

Can anyone upload the app , etc?

Thanks for your attention.</description>

Either way, that’s a shoddy excuse, you’d still have to download it. Just download it on Steam.</p>
