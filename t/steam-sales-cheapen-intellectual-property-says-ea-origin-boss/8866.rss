We won&#39;t be doing that. Obviously they think it&#39;s the right thing to do after a certain amount of time. I just think it cheapens your intellectual property. I know both sides of it, I understand it. If you want to sell a whole bunch of units, that is certainly a way to do that, to sell a whole bunch of stuff at a low price. The gamemakers work incredibly hard to make this intellectual property, and we&#39;re not trying to be Target. We&#39;re trying to be Nordstrom. When I say that, I mean good value - we&#39;re trying to give you a fair price point, and occasionally there will be things that are on sale you could look for a discount, just don&#39;t look for 75 percent off going-out-of-business sales.

tl;dr version: They are just jelly because Steam is so successful and makes so many Steam sales.</description>

            <p>I think that even if Valve wouldn’t hire DICE, DICE would be more then happy about selling their products through Steam because that is the would be the only way to survive out there.</p>

            <p>I think we can be fairly certain that BF3, or any future BF games for that matter, will NEVER be coming to Steam as long as EA is standing on its own two fat feet.</p>
<p>What would be great is if EA collapsed and Valve hired the DICE guys to work as a secondary dev team and they combined Source and Frostbite to create the greatest game engine in existence.</p>
<p>That would be fan-fucking-tastic.</p>

            <p>Agreed. Personally, I quite enjoy BF3. It’s a shame that Origin is a requirement. In my case, it adds absolutely no value. When I start up BF3, it logs into Origin and I don’t even see the main window. I play BF3. And then I exit Origin when I’m done. There’s no point really, it doesn’t help with multiplayer, chat, or anything. I’ll be the first to ditch it if there is any way to play BF3 without it.</p>
<p>Steam, on the other hand, is usually the first program I start when I boot up the computer, and often occupies it’s own monitor!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The only reason I have Origin is because of Battlefield 3. Unless DICE start to release all their games exclusively online through Origin, I can’t see myself using it in the future. I wouldn’t say Steam was so successful back in '09 when I first got it, because at that point the physical game market for all platforms was booming, and there was no real reason to link purchases to an online account. But I think one of the main things which made Steam suddenly so successful was the release of Call of Duty games exclusively for Steam - I’m guessing Activision saw the potential in an online marketplace/community like Steam. From then on, Steam started becoming a requirement for a massive number of releases, due to the ease of release and updating and integration with social networking. Customers would come to Steam to play the game they bought in-store, and then be hooked in by Steam’s instant buy-and-play system, coupled with the insane sales. The more games use Steam as a necessary platform for release, maintenance and network playing, the more customers Steam rakes in, and the more money it makes from the sales.<br>
Where is this going? Steam has quickly snowballed into one of the biggest names in intellectual property distribution, and quite frankly EA just appears butt-hurt that their Origin platform has made it late for the party - the only reason people use Origin really is games like Battlefield 3 which aren’t available on Steam or in stores, and those customers have no incentive to stay with Origin.<br>
As for GOG, I don’t know why they’re annoyed. I absolutely love GOG, and anybody in their right mind would choose GOG over Steam for its collection of ‘oldies’, because the UI is entirely online, there are unlimited downloads to any computer and all games come fully optimised for modern OSs.</p>

            <p>Even nowadays AAA games are too expensive in my opinion! What is the most you can get out of a game? 12-15 hours of fun (most of them don’t have any replay value - MP aside, I’m not such a passionate multiplayer fan)? Hell, that’d be about 5€ for an hour of gameplay (60€ ~ 74$ seems to be the new price for licensing intellectual property in EAs eyes). And that’s about what I get on my salary … so NO!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven’t bought a game at full price since The Orange Box came out, and even then, I got the pre-order discount.  Games are too expensive; perhaps if publishers like EA wouldn’t vampire all the profits off the top, developers would be able to sell them for less.</p>
<p>EDIT: In fact, now that I’m thinking about it, I can’t remember ever buying a game at full-full price.  I got HL and HL2 for christmases, Ep1 and OB with preorder discount.  All my Bethesda games on sale.  All my indie games in bundles.  Bioshock: sale.  Borderlands: sale.  L4D and L4D2, Portal 2: sales.  Back in the day, all the SIM games I played were gifts.  Bought C&amp;C: Worldwide Warfare (a box set with the original C&amp;C and C&amp;C: Red Alert and all expansions for both) used for $20.  Penumbra Collector’s Edition Bundle.  Thief Bundle.  Deus Ex HR: Sale.  Bastion: Sale.  Witcher: Sale.  Batman AA and AC: Sales.  ME and ME2: Sales (and I actually waited a long and painful time for ME2 to go on sale.)  On and on and on and on…</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, I may have bought Garry’s Mod for full price.  All $10.  But I hardly think that counts.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed, I can’t think of any time I have paid full price on a game. Even before Steam and its sales I always bought games on sale or that were used. And I rarely bought them on sale, however after steam I have bought a lot of games on sale and those profits went to the game companies rather than Gamestop or wherever.</p>

            <p>I do not support the cheapening of intellectual property.  I think that AAA games with massive budgets have their place in the game industry.  I just think major publishers need to learn that not everything they do has to be AAA games and that they could instead of doing only a few AAA games do a lot of medium budget games and a couple of AAA games.</p>

            <p>I support cheapening intellectual property, because games are not worth $50. EA needs to realize my price point and design their games accordingly.</p>

            <p>I’ve actually just bought Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 during the Steam Summer Sale, even thought I already owned a physical copy of both of them, because it was so darn cheap. I’ve done this plenty with games I already owned physical copies of. I like not having to find my CD’s/DVD’s for each game, install all the patches, and install no CD cracks (I hate dragging out my physical CD/DVD just to play a game) every time I want to put a new game on my rig. With Steam sales it makes it a no brainer for me to buy it twice so I can have all my games easily accessible all in one place and I don’t have to mess with any of that nonsense. In the end not only am I happy but the makers of the games end up getting double sales from me regardless of how little I pay for it during the Steam sale. I think that’s kinda the opposite of cheapening an IP.</p>

            <p>Steam sales is still much better than the console gaming situation.</p>
<p>Console games:</p>
<ol>
<li>game is sold in-store at full price. developer/publisher/store each take a cut a varying ratios.(people still buy at this price)<br>
2.game is soon sold as pre-owned for considerably cheaper. Only the store takes a cut. (gives people a chance on a smaller budget to purchase the game)</li>
</ol>
<p>PC/Steam</p>
<ol>
<li>game is sold at full price. Developer/valve take a cut. (People still buy at this price if they want the game at release)</li>
<li>a considerable time later the game goes on sale.(takes more time than how soon a pre-owned game for console takes to be available). the developer still takes a cut unlike console’s pre-owned situation.</li>
</ol>
<p>the only difference between console and pc is the devs still make money on pc. how is this bad?</p>

            <p>In terms of profit margins if you buy a disc from a store there are a number of people who take a cut:</p>
<p>Developers<br>
Publishers<br>
Platform Owner Royalties (If console - if windows live I expect M$ take a cut here too despite doing nothing)<br>
Store Owner<br>
Distributors and cost of materials</p>
<p>Pretty sure the publisher takes the biggest cut there but to be fair they are the ones that front the money for these games to be made. The money that goes to the developers pays salaries.</p>
<p>If you look at the direct download models and services like Onlive you will see that the publishers still take that same percentage or bigger, the services still charges the same (in a lot of cases more) and yet the retail and distribution sections aren’t involved.</p>
<p>That’s what I object to and one reason why I think digital distribution will never explode in popularity. People still like to have the actual disc in their hands when buying a game, spending more or the same for a game that you may not be able to play in a few years because the servers have been switched off just doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>I don’t like EA’s business practices but it’s not as if they are the only ones doing it. If you play Call of Duty you will likely be suckered into buying DLC maps. Oh how I miss the days of PC games with mod tools, pretty sure that era is over.</p>
<p>Sales in the end don’t cheapen intellectual property rights EA, they just reduce your profit margins and that is what you are worried about. If you are worried about artist integrity why not actually encourage art and give them time to instead of forcing your developers to make ridiculous deadlines.</p>
