    <title>problem with Beyond Good &amp; Evil</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-with-beyond-good-evil/4657</link>
    <description>I own the retail version, and wanted to play it again. I got the audio/video synchronisation bug and the glitchy graphics covered, but everytime I change the &quot;water details&quot; setting to middle or high, the game stutters terribly (framerate 10-20). Must have something to do with the graphics card, on my old ati 9800 it ran perfectly. But on my geforce 7600gt I get the stuttering problem.

I found a forum with people experiencing the same problem, but no solution was found. Ubi support, of course, still doesn&#39;t answer after a week.

Does anybody know a solution? I tried old, new and alternative (omega) drivers.

[b]EDIT:[/b]
Ubisoft anwered meanwhile; they don&#39;t know/care, because there is no more official support for the game.</description>

            <p>AA is off, I got a single core cpu.<br>
Even if I turn everything off/low in the advanced settings, the problem occurs.</p>

            <p>Hold on now, do you have a multicore processor in your computer? There’s a goofy thing where you need to use Task Manager to shut down the other processors when the game is running so that it only uses one. Prince of Persia has a similar issue.</p>
<p>I managed to dig up a patch program that allows you to tweak the game.exe so that it does that automatically, and you don’t have to manually pull up task manager every time you run the game, but I can’t remember where I found it.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there are a number of actual graphic issues that can be fixed by adjusting the advanced video settings. I had things like the various characters had their eyeballs floating out of their head and stuff until I got them set right.</p>
<p>Anyway, try the task manager thing first: start Beyond Good and Evil, run task manager, go to your processes tab and find BGE.exe, right click on it, and select “set affinity” and make sure that only one of the CPUs has its checkbox checked. If that works, I’ll go to the effort of directing you to the patcher to fix things.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, and I checked through the forums, apparently someone seems to have fixed an issue similar to you simply by turning antialiasing off, which results in no significant loss of graphical fidelity, but seems to remove issues with water and a few other things.</p>
