    <title>Faceposer reveresed?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/faceposer-reveresed/3033</link>
    <description>I recently started using faceposer in the Source SDK. I have been practicing lip syncing and now I have come across an issue...When the character plays the animation, his lips do reversed animation. Like with the aa phenome, instead of opening his mouth, the models closes his mouth really tight... I don&#39;t know whats up and need help.I have to add phenomes manually cuz I run on Windows 7.</description>
