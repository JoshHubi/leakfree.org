    <title>No pistol animations</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-pistol-animations/12883</link>
    <description>Hi. I uninstalled Black Mesa and put my save files on the desktop (I had custom weapons installed dont know if that helps any) and recently reinstalled it and now the pistol seems to have no firing, reload, or any other animations.... I tried installing mods with custom animations to no avail. I have tried to reinstall it to see if it would fix itself but it didnt. Does anyone have a idea on how to fix it? Thank you

            <p>save games are probably for an older version of the weapon/animation mods, if you want to re-use your old saves you probably need to recreate the same game as it was when they were made</p>
