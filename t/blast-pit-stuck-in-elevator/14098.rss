    <title>Blast Pit - Stuck in elevator</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blast-pit-stuck-in-elevator/14098</link>
    <description>So, I got myself stuck in the elevator in Blast Pit.  I got in the elevator that&#39;s supposed to grind to a halt then fall soon after into a pool of toxic waste.

As the elevator was descending, I got a little impatient and tried to jump out the window before the elevator stopped.  I got caught between a support beam and the elevator and cannot move; I can turn around in place, though.  The elevator descending sound loops over and over again.
