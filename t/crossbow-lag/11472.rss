    <title>Crossbow Lag</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crossbow-lag/11472</link>
    <description>Whenever I try and scope with the Crossbow, I get major lag spikes. This really doesn&#39;t help aim at all. Anything I can do to help with that?



A part of me is convinced this is the Developers trying to make the Crossbow less OP

            <p>yeah your absolutley right on this and nobody seems to know what is really causing the choppiness of movement when scoped.</p>
<p>I would just hope they can put an overlay of the scope to the zoomed suit as the zoomed suit does not suffer these issues… Somthing is definatley wrong here</p>
