    <description>If you haven&#39;t seen Jay Benson&#39;s fan-made trailer of Half Life, then do so via the link below. I found it fairly inspiring in regard to how the Half Life franchise could be more visually immersive; granted it doesn&#39;t become to scripted via cue of arm/hand use. Nonetheless something like that probably could only be added as optional added code well after release of the mod, but just throwing it out there anyways as food for thought.

            <p>I didn’t want to press that button with my finger. I wanted to press it with my gun barrel. Immersion ruined, I’m not playing this ever again.</p>
<p>This is why a minimalist attitude towards programming is better for immersion. The more stuff you start programming in to please one person, the more stuff you have to program in to please every person. Otherwise everyone will be upset that their idea of immersion isn’t satisfied, and that what is done instead is game breaking.</p>
<p>Duke Nukem Forever is a perfect example. Look at all of the immersion that they programed into the game. Now think of how poor the game is because half of the things that they programed in don’t work, and the other half don’t improve the fun factor one little bit.</p>
<p>Leave it as it is. Don’t fix it if it isn’t broken, especially when all of the fixes are broken.</p>

<p>The reason I don’t want to see animations of hands pushing buttons and stuff is because it artifically ties the player to a spot for a couple of seconds. Look at any game that does this. Bulletstorm for example. You use a lever or press a button, your character slides magically into position and mashes the button, <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">taking control away from the player while it does it</span></span>. This goes against one of the main design points of Half-life.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True, I certainly wouldn’t want a scenario where I press one button and get multiple actions performed by the protagonist (assassin’s creed comes to mind). Nor would I want triggered actions to project an artificial emotion upon the player. But alot of the simple/one note actions are done during subtle, relatively calmer moments of the game anyhow; and only serve to supplement the experience. In other words, it could work on a minimal level.</p>

            <p>It never ever bothered me that you can’t see Gordon’s body, and that his hands don’t touch buttons and ladders… Sure, it’s unrealistic, but it’s not something that’s annoying or even noticeable, unless you specifically pay attention to it.</p>
<p>I think that the act of Gordon pressing a button is equivalent to you pressing E on your keyboard, which satisfies your expectation of seeing a finger press a button, for example.</p>
<p>Maybe in a game engine in 5 years we’ll see something much more realistic, but for now I’m sure this is nothing to waste coding time on.</p>
<p>Mirror’s edge is a good example, but then Mirror’s Edge is more realistic in terms of the human character you control. It’s more about you being skilled with your body, while Half-Life is you being skilled at thinking and aiming, which are more external to the body.</p>

<p>Well, it’s not a cylinder, it’s a rectangular box. To make matters worse it doesn’t even rotate with the player camera &amp; they’re usually so much larger than what seems necessary. I always end up reminded of these pictures when talking about it:<br>

<p>It doesn’t even work well in Mirrors Edge because you can still stand on the corner of a brush &amp; have both of the player’s feet floating in the air without falling.</p>
<p>What really gets me is that so much work was put into the vehicle physics that was only used in a few maps in Half-Life 2, yet the player physics was more or less cut &amp; pasted from the first game. When I first saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0yvs6RJVVY" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Euphoria physics engine</a> I wondered how long before a first-person game actually implemented it for the player physics &amp; I’m still waiting. At the very least I wish some moders would do something like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpLQbKPskJM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Ragmorph Gmod Addon</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>VALVe may be claiming that they don’t show arms and legs in order to help the impression that YOU are the hero, but that’s, sorry folks, PR bullshit.</p>
<p>The real reason is the fact that the player character is a cylinder float through the world, and it can stand on any ledge, no matter how narrow, if at least “1 pixel” of the cylinder’s base is on that ledge.</p>
<p>Should you ever add visible feet to the character, you’d immediately see the visual implausibility of the game – since legs are narrower than body, the player would frequently levitate next to a ledge (the cliff in Half-Life 1 where you shoot down the helicopter is a prime example of these narrow ledges).</p>
<p>In Mirror’s Edge, you’re forced to put your back against a wall before you can traverse a ledge. That’s OK if you are unarmed athlete who tries to avoid combat, but Half-Life is NOT that kind of game. In HL, you’re a warrior (albeit with PhD), armed to the teeth, and you need to be able to shoot almost any time, even on ladders etc.</p>
<p>It’s just a no-go in current style of the game.</p>

</aside>
<p>Really? Cause Valve didn’t mind placing legs in Left 4 Dead, a game that doesn’t try to make the player believe they are the hero and the only game that has cutscenes outside the view of the player and the only game that makes the player speak. And it doesn’t make the game seem implausible even when stepping up to ledges. It just re-affirms that you are that character. Restricting player camera movement in a vehicle would take them no time at all to program into the game if they felt it were necessary.</p>

<p>I actually wasn’t referring to the head bob as much, but more to the animations.  All the animations for doors, machines, etc are really jerky and overexaggerated.  (Look at the loader. LOOK AT IT.)</p>

            <p>the main problem with the video is that it can’t actually be implemented into a game without turning it into heavy rain or some other bs</p>
<p>Mirror’s Edge-style body awareness would be cool tho.</p>

            <p>Head bobbing is lame, I’m more concerned about the way the gun tracks when you look around. In HL2 it has that nice little drag, and it goes in and out of your FOV the more you look up or down.</p>

<p>I don’t see how that’s relevant.</p>
<p>I would like to see more transparent limbs in the next half life, as far as using buttons, turning valves, <span class="bbcode-i">maybe</span> climbing ladders, and especially driving goes.  But for Black Mesa, they should keep it in line with Half-Life 2’s style.</p>
