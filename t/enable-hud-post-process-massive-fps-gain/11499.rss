    <title>Enable HUD Post Process - Massive FPS Gain</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/enable-hud-post-process-massive-fps-gain/11499</link>
    <description>Hey, i was playing Black Mesa Source today, and i was getting 5-50FPS max. 
Any fire to action my fps was below 10. So much chopping lag, couldnt figure out what was causing it. 

Tried about everything, and then i disabled HUD Post Process in the Black Mesa tab in the options menu and my FPS went up to 200+. 

My system info is
i7-860 (8 cores w/HT) - I have set affinity to all except CPU 0
2x HD5870 in Crossfire.
8GB DDR3 Ram.
Norm HDD

Had a quick search and couldnt see any issues identified with this before, other than glitching graphics - this may help others.

My console data had some material errors only.

            <p>Yes this is an old post and yes it works.</p>
<p>I have been playing BMS all year with better and better performance as I slowly upgrade the hardware.  Until 2 days ago when I got crossfire for the first time ever and saw my fps in BMS get cut in half!  Dunno what the HUD has to do with anything but disabling it gave me back my fps and possibly a wee bit more.<br>
This game is still mainly held back by CPU performance though.</p>
