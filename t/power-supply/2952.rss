    <title>Power Supply</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/power-supply/2952</link>
    <description>More idiotic questions, I know.

I already own a 750watt power supply on my old computer, and looking through Newegg that seems to be a pretty high power supply. Assuming I can get all the cords untangled and figure out what they do, can I just use the same power supply in a new computer or would I have to buy a new one specifically designed to work with newer hardware such as an i7 Processor?

It&#39;s a pre-made computer, so looking at where all the cords go I&#39;m not totally sure I could untangle them all or figure out what they do...</description>

            <p>I could possibly use the tower I have now, but I’ve never been a fan of it and can barely put the thing together once it’s apart so I’m probably going to. Why?</p>
<p>Proprietary form factor? Ugh… Alienware had better not messed up my power supply like it did almost everything else they sent me. &lt;_&lt;</p>
<p>I might make 1 thread to combine all these questions later, I didn’t think I would make a second thread so fast.</p>

            <p>Can you keep all of these questions in one centralized thread?</p>
<p>But yes, the power supply 'ought to work just fine if the manufacturer didn’t use some proprietary form factor. Are you planning on buying a new tower?</p>

            <p>I know the Power Supply works, I’m just wondering if I need to buy a new one for a new computer. So as long as it was working in my old computer just fine, it will work in my new computer. Awesome, that’s another thing off the list.</p>
<p>In other news, I just realized after removing this stuff that Guitar Hero III is in my CD Drive. Guess I’ll have to save that too.</p>

            <p>Unless it’s broken you can reuse your current power supply.</p>
<p>I’m sure you know this already, but don’t test if it works using your new PC, use an old one to find out.</p>
