    <title>Difficulty: Hard + weapon handlers</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/difficulty-hard-weapon-handlers/1093</link>
    <description>How about when you choose difficulty hard:

* Human enemies use the secondary attack on their weapons
* Alien enemies have a faster rate of fire on their weapons
* Enemies jump around and dodge your bullets (as if this is Unreal Tournament 3)


I was also hoping that the dev&#39;s let human enemies (assassins or human grunts) handle guns we rarely see them use e.g. an assassin use a magnum or a human grunt use a rocket launcher. This should only be seen rarely and not most of the time. 

Thank you for your magnificent time and enjoy ur fruits and vegetables.

            <p>Half of the people on this thread aren’t going to bother playing the game on hard, they’re gonna play it on easy, and then bitch about how ridiculously stupid the soldiers are.</p>
<p>They just want to put out stupid suggestions in the hopes that the devs will make “Hard” ridiculously difficult.</p>

            <p>I had a whole other paragraph I cut from my post, where I also bitched about how everyone’s suggestions for increasing difficulty were about trying to rewrite the game’s rules for each difficulty level.</p>
<p>When you change the difficulty, it should always be a predictable change. Changes in speed, damage, accuracy, time limits, etc. are good, because they don’t change the game mechanics.</p>
<p>Half-life is great with this and it only has one exception, the assassins turning invisible. This wouldn’t be such a bad thing, but when I first fought them on hard, I had no idea they were invisible, or where they even were. They should be able to do it regardless of difficulty level. The difficulty level could change the opacity, the time they spend invisible, how frequently they can become invisible, or how much damage they need to take before they can become invsible, but not decide if they can or can’t.</p>
<p>The same should apply for floating platforms falling, or anything else like it.</p>

<p>You already have that on easy and medium difficulty. This thread is about hard difficulty and the changes in gameplay that could be implemented for extra challenge.</p>

<p>How about when you choose difficulty hard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human enemies use the secondary attack on their weapons</li>
<li>Alien enemies have a faster rate of fire on their weapons</li>
<li>Enemies jump around and dodge your bullets (as if this is Unreal Tournament 3)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was also hoping that the dev’s let human enemies (assassins or human grunts) handle guns we rarely see them use e.g. an assassin use a magnum or a human grunt use a rocket launcher. This should only be seen rarely and not most of the time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your magnificent time and enjoy ur fruits and vegetables.</p>
