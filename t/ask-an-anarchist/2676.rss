    <title>Ask an Anarchist.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ask-an-anarchist/2676</link>
    <description>Eventually there will be an &quot;ask a...&quot; thread for everything, so here&#39;s the Anarchist one ahead of schedule.

I believe that it would be possible, and beneficial, to exist in a government-less state. This doesn&#39;t necessitate the eradication of all government, and at its most base form could just be the adaptation of volunteers to an autonomous, kingless society, which can happen right in the middle of any governing system.

So, if you&#39;ve got questions about Anarchy, I&#39;ve got answers.</description>

</aside>
<p>No, because the system we have now is more of a ‘mixed economy’ than a Capitalistic society, and also has laws taken from other economic-political ideas, i.e. taxes. (In an Objectivist country, paying taxes would be optional).</p>
<p>Also, can we please continue this in my thread? I feel as if I’m hijaking this one.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re probably wondering if the classic “Company Takes Over The World” scenario occurs, right? Example being, if Joe Smith makes Smith &amp; Co. which becomes the greatest business known to man, and then uses his power to, say, steal property and then bribe authorities, then there are two things that can happen.</p>
<p>-The governement can, and should, take direct action against this single corporation not because it’s grown too large, but because it is forming into a corrupt governement.</p>
<p>If the governement does NOT take action, then the citizens will most likely rebel and take action themselves in a civilized manner.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Objectivism is much like anarchism in several ways. Objectivists believe that the only governement that would be in a perfect society is a judicial branch, a military branch, and a local protection branch. Like the modern governement of the United States, all three branches will ensure that the others do not become overpowered. The only laws that would be passed in that governemnt would be to protect individual rights, such as property and safety, without restricting Capitalism.</p>

            <p>In principle, I’m an anarchist. Nobody other than myself should decide what I should and should not do.<br>
However, I am perfectly aware that a society (such as the ones we have today) cannot work with anarchistic principles, and I have an entirely different viewpoint as to how a society should be run.</p>
<p>Sure, if we all started living like the north american indians did it’d be pretty chill, but I don’t see that happening, and I’m not sure their lifestyle would work with almost 7 billion people.</p>
