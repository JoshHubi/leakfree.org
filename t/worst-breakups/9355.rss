<p>Oh… I am a creature of different habits. Whenever I close a door to the outside, be it coming in or letting a guest/pet out, the deadbolt claps.</p>
<p>…I have locked family members outside many times, but they understand.</p>
<p>Perhaps he is of the same habit and thought your unlocked door was an invitation back… but I highly doubt it, as if anyone would overthink things as much as I do.</p>

            <p>Yikes. You didn’t give him a set of keys for the one-time thing, right?!</p>
<p>As for the situation itself, I can only imagine that’d have helped if the primary attraction/“love” for such an ex was sexual. When you really care[d] about a person, what’s random intercourse going to change, it seems no more consoling than masturbation.</p>
<p>Go to hell, people who jump to proffer that advice.</p>

            <p>Rebounding is never that great, but it does help prevent a future problem of feeling like shit because your ex is banging some new person and you haven’t found anyone.<br>
At least it takes the edge off the sting.</p>

<p>Yeah, rebounds are one of the worst possible things you can do for that. I doubt the person rebounded upon would particularly appreciate being used in such a way either.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Depends on what the person knows beforehand in my opinion.<br>
My particular scenario, the girl said “I’m fine with being your rebound girl, but it can’t last”<br>
But on the subject of ‘fuckbuddies’ and one night stands… can’t really talk about that with any real knowledge.<br>
I have always been one to wait until I was in a relationship I THOUGHT would last before having sex. So my number is quite low compared to most guys (and girls) I know.</p>
<p>So low it can be counted on one finger. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>WTF?  I’m jealous!  I’ve been trying to rebound for the last few weeks!  But girls are just not interested in a 28 year old pervert who watches them from behind trash cans.  Go figure!<br>
And here you are hooking up with guys without even trying.</p>
<p>You must be smooth.</p>

<p>I have no desire to start a debate. I just made an off-hand comment, people responded, and I followed up on it.<br>
I already said that I made a mistake, and that the matter could be dropped.</p>
<p>I guess I can see your reasoning, though, and it’s probably just a result of me needing to explain myself, like I am now, things escalating from there because everyone involved feels a need to comment, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s all just us misunderstanding what the other is trying to convey.</p>
<p>So, yeah, we should probably just stop this.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually I do have a question. Since you don’t have romantic relationships, you would simply have interpersonal ones. Have you ever had a painful parting with someone? You must have a non-romantic example. It would certainly be different than the current examples…</p>

<p>Well… I can’t really say I’m ultra-depressed like some of the crazy shit talked about in here… but I did have a break up once that involved me walking into my ex’s room and seeing her having sex with her sister.</p>
<p>Yes… her sister. And, no… I did not want to join in… (as many of my friends have asked). It was… disgusting, and so sad at the same time. And it caught me so off guard that I just left without saying anything to her… but, that’s my worst breakup story.</p>
<p>Eesh.</p>

<p>That is crazy… and I don’t really know what to say to that. :fffuuu:</p>

<p>You know what they say when you assume. Well, in this case just you.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>You seem to be equating my disbelief of ‘true’ love as having no feelings or a shitty upbringing when that is furthest from the truth. My belief is not based on cynicism or any shitty thoughts. It is simply a belief based on something I believe is not real. At no time did I say I don’t believe in love, I even stated previously that I do believe you can love someone and have loved in the past. But this concept of a one ‘true’ love where you find that one person who is forever and ever your one single soul mate who you will go off into the ever after with is false.</p>
<p>For me it was like this lightning strike moment, where I finally came to the realization that it isn’t real. As I went through life I began seeing these small matchstick lights of truth that over time added more and more doubt to the concept of ‘true’ love. The one couple, for me, who epitomized the concept of true love, ended up divorcing 20+ years later and now can’t stand each other.</p>
<p>So in that lightning strike moment I realized that there is no such thing as true love. There is love, just not the concept of a life long love with that one person. And to be honest, I’ve never been happier. All this time, going through life, searching for ‘true’ love only to be heart broken and disappointed time after time when the relationship failed. The pressure of finding "true’ love, the stress of wondering if this next time is it. No more, and I couldn’t be happier. I now go out armed with the knowledge, that for me, it doesn’t exist so now I no longer am burdened with that weight.</p>
<p>Now, I go out and there is no pressure. If I meet someone and it turns into something, I go into it with the knowledge that it will inevitably end. It may end in a week, 6 months or 10 years, but it will end. And knowing that has freed me. I like to feel I’ve evolved beyond, and no longer carry that weight. Again, I believe in love. And if I find someone and fall in love then that’s good. But if that relationship ends, and it will, I know am prepared for it. I now see life as a series of relationships that will come and go, and through each one I will create good memories and good times and when it ends, the next will begin. And so the pattern will repeat until I die.</p>
<p>So instead of regretting that last, I simply look forward to the next. I’ve swapped the regret for the anticipation.</p>
<p><em>shrugs</em> Just the way I feel now. You may think it’s cynical when in actuality it’s not. I’m actually a half glass full kinda guy. I have no animosity towards the concept of “true love” I just don’t believe in it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So because you have never been or seen two people that have in fact, found TRUE LOVE… you have decided it does not exist?</p>

            <p>To be clear, I’m not saying that there’s anything wrong with debate at all. But sometimes that’s just not the role we should play in a specific context.</p>
<p>Also, I think that you’re a nice, intelligent person, and that your comments are very thoughtful.</p>

            <p>In life, we play multiple roles depending on context. In some contexts, we play the role of making the statements. In other contexts, we play the role of asking the questions. In some contexts we talk, in others, we listen. In some contexts, we are the experienced, and in others, the inexperienced.</p>
<p>You seem to want to debate about heartbreak, but it’s already clear that you haven’t yet experienced it. So, I really don’t see why you would think this is the proper role for you in this context.</p>

<p>How would you know that?</p>
<p>You’re entitled to your opinion, certainly. But you’re in this thread giving your opinions of heartbreak when you’ve never actually experienced it, and comparing it to other experiences you’ve likely not yet had.</p>
<p>It’s a bit like me arguing about the experience of giving birth with a bunch of mothers. I might be able to fake it a little by guessing at a few things correctly or repeating some things I’ve heard from others, but essentially, I just wouldn’t know what I was talking about in any real way.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, it’s not really about my opinion. I’m just going on definitions here, and the situations I’ve most commonly seen the word being applied to.</p>
<p>Though I guess I could have misinterpreted usage in translating what I know of the Swedish equivalent. You’re probably right, let’s just drop that point and go with my other reasoning:</p>

<p>Also, those are the kinds of relations discussed in this thread, so yeah, my message stands.</p>
