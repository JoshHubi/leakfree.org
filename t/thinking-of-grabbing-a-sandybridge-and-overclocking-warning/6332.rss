    <title>Thinking of grabbing a Sandybridge and overclocking? Warning!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/thinking-of-grabbing-a-sandybridge-and-overclocking-warning/6332</link>
    <description>I just thought I had better warn people on here as I myself have recommended grabbing the new Sandybridge processors and doing a bit of overclocking to members here.

You probably already know that the new i5 and i7 processors are very overclockable if you grab the K versions. What you may not be aware of is the warnings around about voltages, it seems the 32nm processors are a lot more delicate than the previous Clarkdale and Lynnfield processors. 

These figures are from the forums at overclockers.co.uk with intel recommendations and their own:
[quote]
Core Voltage - Not recommended too exceed 1.38v, doing so could kill the CPU, we therefor recommend a range of 1.325-1.350v if overclocking.

Memory Voltage - Intel recommend 1.50v plus/minus 5% which means upto 1.58v is the safe recommended limit. In our testing we have found 1.65v has caused no issues as of yet.

BCLK Base Clock - This is strictly a NO, anyone using base clock overclocking could/will cause damage to CPU/Mainboard. It may also kill other components. Set it manually to 100 as some boards auto set it slightly too high at 100.3. To put it simply if you value the life of your components, do not overclock using base clock.

PLL Voltage - Do not exceed 1.9v!!

Processor - Basically we recommend customers not to exceed 1.35v to play it safe, all our bundles are set at 1.3250v. Anything over 1.38v will limit CPU lifespan and anything over 1.42v will likely kill the CPU or severely limit its lifespan.

Memory - Intel recommend 1.50v plus/minus 5% which means 1.60v is the ideal safe maximum, but we have found in our testing all 1.65v memory is fine. We have also found most new 1.65v like Corsair XMS3 will run at its rated timings with just 1.50-1.55v which is well within Intel specifications. So people upgrading to Sandybridge you can still use your old DDR3, but we do recommend you run it at 1.60v or less.

PLL Voltage - Again do not exceed 1.9v!

These are just guidelines we recommend you follow, if you want to push more voltage through your CPU&#39;s then just be aware they could die on you. Not all CPU&#39;s are as fragile as others, we have experimented up to 1.50v Vcore and 1.70v memory and as of yet we have had zero issues with reliability, so it seems some sandy bridge CPU’s are fine when pushing hard.

I suggest if you want to push really hard for a max overclock to never set any voltages to auto. Most if not all P67/1155 boards will set the voltage way beyond the safe maximums above up to the apparent VVID of 1.52v which now according to intel will kill the CPU. If you find you can&#39;t boot with a vcore of 1.35 and a multiplier of 45+ you probably have a weaker CPU, at least if it doesn&#39;t boot you know you haven&#39;t killed the CPU through over volting!

Who needs more than a 4Ghz quad core these days anyway?  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

            <p>No problem, these figures may be revised soon but I recommend playing it safe. I think anything up to 4.4Ghz should run at less than 1.3v on the vcore and you don’t really need anymore than that. The i7 2600K is only really beaten by the i7 980x in benchmarks at stock.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if AMD can equal intel with their Fuzion line. I kind of hope so.</p>

            <p>thx for the info, I am still planning to get the i5 because no overclocking = not my computer</p>
