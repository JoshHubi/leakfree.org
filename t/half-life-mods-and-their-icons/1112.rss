    <title>Half Life - Mods and their icons</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-mods-and-their-icons/1112</link>
    <description>Ok guys.. I have about 40 HL mods and yet when I open my steam interface, none of them have icons to the left.  Why?  Oh wait a sec... the new and improved Poke 646: Vengeance has an icon!  Alas, I cannot figure out how this half life one mod has an icon yet none of the others do.

I have searched and cant find how it is done. For example: Azure sheep. I took the AzureSheep.ico icon, shrunk it down to 16x16, named it identical to the directory name with the extension of tga but my steam interface does not show the azure sheep icon.
 
So... how do you guys assign an icon to the mod line item/name within the steam interface?</description>

            <p>Oh, right. Steam mods have the icon value in their Liblist…<br>
If I wasn’t using WON I would have known that. Glad to hear you got it fixed.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I had the distinguished pleasure of gaining assistance from another gamer that likes his  steam list nice and tidy WITH icons next to the HL Mods.  Marc Schröder; the Project Lead of Poke 646: Vendetta was happy to help me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the “liblist.gam” file for each mod (found in the root<br>
of the mod’s folder) with a text editor (such as Notepad)</li>
<li>Add the following line to the file and save it.</li>
</ol>
<p>icon “your_icon_name”</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Place a 16x16px TGA named “your_icon_name.tga”  in the rood mod folder.<br>
(the name can be really anything you desire as long as it matches the<br>
given name in the liblist.gam)</li>
<li>Launch steam to see your new icon showing.</li>
</ol>
<p>This was a feature added with Steam so most pre-Steam mods don’t use it, even if they released a later Steam compatibility patch.</p>

            <p>didja all notice “black mesa sauce” is not in there? yeah… so dont think that just cuz someone is on the team that they get a copy of the game.</p>
<p>Anyway… back on topic.</p>
<p>I am thinking this is not possible unless the modder coded something specifically to point to an icon.  I am not a modder so I dont know how it would have been done.</p>

            <p>:s hrug:</p>
<p>Natural Selection, Poke 646: Vendetta and SvenCoop are all HL1 mods that have icons showing in the steam interface.  I just cant seem to duplicate how their icons show but others do not.</p>

            <p>…does a mod need to specify it has an icon or does it just need to be named correctly?<br>
Also, does Steam mind which version/compression is used in the .tga?</p>

            <p>NINJA EDIT:<br>
PIC is now updated to show this is now working.  See below for details.</p>
<p>Any other ideas? This didnt work. I opened the icon file, shrunk it and saved it as a icon.tga as suggested.</p>

            <p>Renaming a .ico to .tga will not change the content (and it’s the content that specifies the format, not the name as windoze would like) - you’d need to actually convert it.</p>
