    <title>Interloper Extreme Lag and Can&#39;t Pick Up Hat</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/interloper-extreme-lag-and-cant-pick-up-hat/63104</link>
    <description>On Interloper, I completed the last little lazer mission to bounce up to the final levels, and then all of a sudden the game got supper laggy, I got these messages in the console. I can&#39;t pick my hat back up because my guns fire nonstop and its incredibly laggy. I cant go back to a previous save either. I tried to complete the mission, which I did successfully, but if I shoot the grate that sucks me out of the container, I cant stop shooting. Please, I worked so hard for this and deleted a lot of saves a few minutes before all this happened.

            <p>Restarting the chapter might be the only solution.<br>
This includes hacking the grate with a crowbar? Or can you not reach it?</p>

            <p>I have the same problem in this place of the game. It does not depend on the graphics settings or<br>
compatibility settings.</p>
