    <title>Track Listing for the Soundtrack?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/track-listing-for-the-soundtrack/12123</link>
    <description>Hi there, 

I was just wondering if there was any sort of official track order for the soundtrack? Currently on the soundtrack website, the listing is simply alphabetical and the download contains no track order information.

Obviously it makes no sense to actually listen to it in alphabetical order, as you then end up listening to End Credits (both parts) less than halfway through the album, when it makes obvious sense that they should be included at the end of the soundtrack.

Is there some sort of suggested listening order out there, official or otherwise, that I can try? I like to listen to soundtracks in their entirety rather than as individual tracks.</description>

        <title>Track Listing for the Soundtrack?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[Open_Source_Forever]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here’s my personal listing as I set it on my copy of the album taking into account both the “miscellaneous ambiance” files &amp; the songs from the “uncut” attachments:</p>

<p>Some of those ambiences are just the general location, and I’m not going to play through the entire game right now to find the exact location.</p>
<p>And Crypt, it sounds fine in the game without music over that scene. I love it. However, when simply listening to the music on its own, there is no indication that crap has come down at all, and it cuts straight to the moment after the cascade. Also, where you say BM Mesa Mix, I say no, it’s actually Unforeseen Consequences.</p>

            <p>Eh, I think the cascade sounds chaotic and sexy enough to be able to get by without a track, WGH isn’t very fitting, anyway. <span class="bbcode-i">However</span> the very sad BM Theme Mesa Mix plays directly after the cascade, upon waking up.</p>

<p>Just want to mention that Surface Tension 3 and 4, ingame, are switched with each other. Since 3 is used for the garg chase and 4 for the tripmine facility.</p>
<p>And I suppose that 1 makes a comeback right after 2 because of fighting the apache on the cliff. But that’s a repeat.</p>
<p>What I would really like to see is the placement for those 8 or so tracks that don’t even have names. They’re in the games files and mainly used for ambience, but I’d so like to know exactly when most of them are used~</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hmmm. Just listened to them in that order, 4 before 3, and I think I like it better that way. 3 is more climactic than 4, and serves as a better finale for ST.</p>
<p>This is true. I don’t see the need to have it repeated in the above track listing.</p>
<p>Can I get a link to those? More is always appreciated. This soundtrack is kind of short anyway.</p>
<p>EDIT: found those ambiences. I can see why they’re not on the soundtrack; they aren’t very musical, they’re very slow, and not exactly pleasurable for listening. But for the sake of completeness, I’ll add them. Reposting the list soon.</p>

 Fear Will Find You:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Surface Tension 3<br>
Surface Tension 4</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just want to mention that Surface Tension 3 and 4, ingame, are switched with each other. Since 3 is used for the garg chase and 4 for the tripmine facility.</p>
<p>And I suppose that 1 makes a comeback right after 2 because of fighting the apache on the cliff. But that’s a repeat.</p>
<p>What I would really like to see is the placement for those 8 or so tracks that don’t even have names. They’re in the games files and mainly used for ambience, but I’d so like to know exactly when most of them are used~</p>

            <p>I have this listing here:</p>
<p>Black Mesa Theme<br>
Inbound Part 1<br>
Inbound Part 2<br>
Inbound Part 3<br>
Black Mesa Theme (Mesa mix)<br>
Anomalous Materials<br>
We’ve Got Hostiles<br>
Unforeseen Consequences<br>
Office Complex<br>
Office complex (Mesa Remix)<br>
Blast Pit 1<br>
Blast Pit 2<br>
Blast Pit 2 (Mesa Remix)<br>
Blast Pit 3<br>
Power Up<br>
On a Rail 1<br>
On a Rail 2<br>
Apprehension<br>
Apprehension (Mesa Remix)<br>
Residue Processing<br>
Questionable Ethics 1<br>
Questionable Ethics 2<br>
Surface Tension 1<br>
Surface Tension 2<br>
Surface Tension 3<br>
Surface Tension 4<br>
Lambada Core<br>
Forget About Freeman<br>
End Credits Part 1<br>
End Credits Part 2</p>
<p>For the most part, I have left the in-game order of the tracks alone. I have made a few changes for listening pleasure.<br>
-BM Theme (Mesa Mix) now plays after the Inbound tracks. It is originally played over the first menu screen, which depicts a tram station, and it seems a fitting beginning to the story to include it after you depart the tram. It’s much better than putting it second in my listing.<br>
-There is no music to accent the disaster that begins the entire video game franchise. It works fine in the game, but it is a hole in the story when just listening to the music. Therefore, I have filled the hole by pulling We’ve Got Hostiles from its proper place and putting it after Anomalous Materials instead.<br>
-With the game not yet complete and the Xen soundtrack pieces not yet released, there is no proper end to the soundtrack when simply listening. Lambada core is dissatisfying for this purpose, and I have put Forget About Freeman there instead, which sounds, while scoring an action scene, largely hopeful and not dark, making it a nice replacement until the soundtrack is completed.</p>
<p>Overall, this listing is very nice to listen to and there are no “action” tracks that jump out at you when they shouldn’t.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah of course, I’m a bit of an afficianado when it comes to game OSTs. I just like stuff to flow well so it creates the feeling of being on a “musical journey” (how pretentious is that?!) rather than just listening to various disparate tracks.</p>
<p>The handy little colour-coded track guide on the soundtrack website gives a good foundation to go on.</p>
<p>Will have a play around and maybe post the listing I come up with.</p>

            <p>Well, bear in mind it IS a game soundtrack, with sections designed entirely around set pieces with periods of silence in between and never intended to be played as a contiguous piece of music.</p>

            <p>I did try that, but it lead to some odd juxtapositions of tracks which disrupted the flow of the album.</p>
<p>I might mess around and make my own listing.</p>
<p>Bl**dy awesome soundtrack though, one of the best I’ve heard in years. Even more impressive due to the composer’s lack of experience - you’d never know it going by what he created.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I was just wondering if there was any sort of official track order for the soundtrack? Currently on the soundtrack website, the listing is simply alphabetical and the download contains no track order information.</p>
<p>Obviously it makes no sense to actually listen to it in alphabetical order, as you then end up listening to End Credits (both parts) less than halfway through the album, when it makes obvious sense that they should be included at the end of the soundtrack.</p>
<p>Is there some sort of suggested listening order out there, official or otherwise, that I can try? I like to listen to soundtracks in their entirety rather than as individual tracks.</p>
