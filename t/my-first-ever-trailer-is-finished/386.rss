    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-first-ever-trailer-is-finished/386</link>
    <description>Here it is. Remember that I made it solely on Windows Movie Maker, and that I have never made a video before.

            <p>Transitions and such are nice, better then most windows movie maker videos I’ve seen. The real art to machinima/video game films is a lot less in the editing aspect, and a lot more in the actual filming. Once BM comes out, instead of splicing together video segments, go film some gameplay and stuff, because that’s where the artistic talent is needed the most.</p>
<p>Why directors get paid the big bucks.</p>
