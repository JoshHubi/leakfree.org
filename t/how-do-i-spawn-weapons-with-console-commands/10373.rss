    <title>How do I spawn weapons with console commands?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-do-i-spawn-weapons-with-console-commands/10373</link>
    <description>I can explain!  In that tunnel near the beginning of surface tension, I turned around at the end after the loading screen, hitting another loading screen and making almost all of my weapons vanish.  I played through it anyway because I hadn&#39;t noticed but now I&#39;m at the part with the tank and I really wish I still had my crossbow.  I really don&#39;t feel like playing through the level again to fix this.  Does anyone know the commands to spawn weapons?  Specifically, the crossbow, tau cannon, tripmines, and ammo for those.  I&#39;ve recovered everything else.</description>
