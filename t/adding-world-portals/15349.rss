    <title>Adding world portals</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/adding-world-portals/15349</link>
    <description>I assume this is probably a bit too much to ask, but adding world portals (like in Portal 2) would be amazing. Even though of no use in the single player campaign it would be a great feature for mappers.

In case somebody doesn&#39;t know what a world portal is:

            <p>These were used to great effect in Portal 2, but it seems like it is a feature for that specific branch of the engine, which I doubt the devs have actual code for.</p>

            <p>This actually <span class="bbcode-i">would</span> help with a number of maps that don’t quite fit together (I’m looking at <span class="bbcode-i">you</span>, c1a2c…), but I have <em>no</em> idea how these would play with Black Mesa’s substantially different codebase.</p>
<p>The effect <span class="bbcode-i">can </span>in many cases be faked with hidden trigger_teleports- take a look at bm_c1a4c or my upcoming pd_c1a2a for examples of this.</p>
