            <p>Got it working as you suggested with the 2013 version. For posterity, here’s all the steps in one place:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download “Source SDK Base 2013 Singleplayer” from the Steam tools menu.</li>
<li>Run the SDK base at least once so that it drops the necessary files.</li>
<li>Download the Propper 2013 fork from <a href="https://github.com/tuxxi/propper-2013/releases/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/tuxxi/propper-2013/releases/</a>
</li>
<li>Move the propper.exe and propper.fgd files to Steam/steamapps/common/Source SDK Base 2013 Singleplayer/bin</li>
<li>Run Hammer from the executable in the same bin folder.</li>
<li>In the Hammer options menu, click ‘add’ and select propper.fgd</li>
<li>Restart Hammer</li>
<li>Click ‘run map’ and check ‘advanced’.</li>
<li>Click ‘edit’ next to ‘configurations’, make a new configuration named ‘propper’ (or whatever name), and select it.</li>
<li>In the ‘command’ window, hit ‘cmds’, select ‘executable’, and select the propper.exe file you dropped.</li>
<li>In ‘parameters’, enter <code>-game $gamedir $path\$file</code>.</li>
</ol>

            <p>It doesn’t work with our engine version.</p>
<p>What some team members have done is set up a Source 2007 mod using the Source SDK, called “Propper”. And then copied all of Black Mesa’s assets into Propper’s folders, and then used that version of Hammer to run Propper.</p>
