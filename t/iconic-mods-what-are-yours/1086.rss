    <title>Iconic Mods: What are yours?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/iconic-mods-what-are-yours/1086</link>
    <description>Recently I had the good fortune to play two mods that really helped change my look on gaming as a whole. I&#39;ve always been interested in psychology and how you can get to a really deep level with games as an art form. Both Radiator and Dear Esther adressed this in a way that really hit me and I can only say that you really have to play them to see them for what they are. Also I recommend looking at Korsakovia, made by the same guys who made Dear Esther. 

So, are there any mods that you think changed your opinion of something or really blew you away?</description>

<p>:3<br>
the name of the mod is Dear Esther guess who that woman is also if you listen to the the ending voice over you learn who Donelly is I thought it was a good little twist when you find out who Donelly was.</p>
<p>On topic</p>
<p>I liked DayHard even if bad level design, lack of any decent auto-saving, and the amount of really lame dialogue was over the top in this mod. it was entertaining as you could tell it doesn’t take itself in the least bit seriously to begin with so all the problems are dismissible.</p>
<p>Dear Esther as many have said. It was a new type of game experience that felt reminiscent of Myst a game I spent hours as a kid playing exploration without any consequences has sort of been removed from games even Oblivion a game heavy in exploration has monster and things that attack almost anywhere you go.</p>
<p>Sourceforts the game idea is ingenious first build a fort to protect your flag then fight to get the enemies flag only problem is the lack of populated servers only two to three have people on them.</p>

<p>While I might not go THAT far, I agree. Portal: Prelude was a great mod. The Portal chambers were good and the story was good, but it was made as an extra in the Orange Box it seemed to me so it was short and all the levels were designed so that the average gamer could play them. Fun, but a bit too easy for me since I like games with a slight challenge and difficult puzzle games. Portal: Prelude, on the other hand, throws that completely out the door, says “Screw the average gamer”, and raises the intensity level to mind-numbingly frustrating.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Me personally I hated Portal: Prelude. The voice acting is non existant, the gameplay is nothing like the rewarding puzzles in Portal itself and the story is just a jumble of ideas. If they were trying to tell the story of how GLaDOS went evil then they kind of screwed up there. Honestly I don’t think it deserves the credit it gets.</p>
<p>Anyway, I agree with those of you who say Minerva was great. I would have been happy to have had that instead of Episode 1. Maybe not Episode 2 because thats still a favourite of mine, but for what it’s worth, Minerva is a wonderful mod.</p>
<p>Curse also like Mangled said is rather short, but that bit with the snake and the nightmare modes, I literally smacked my gob. It’s visually impressive and doesn’t demand too much out of the gamer, which is both good and bad.</p>
<p>Also I don’t know if I’v already mentioned it but another game by the people that made Dear Esther is coming out this August, check it out here <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/korsakovia" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moddb.com/mods/korsakovia</a></p>

<p>While I might not go THAT far, I agree. Portal: Prelude was a great mod. The Portal chambers were good and the story was good, but it was made as an extra in the Orange Box it seemed to me so it was short and all the levels were designed so that the average gamer could play them. Fun, but a bit too easy for me since I like games with a slight challenge and difficult puzzle games. Portal: Prelude, on the other hand, throws that completely out the door, says “Screw the average gamer”, and raises the intensity level to mind-numbingly frustrating.</p>
<p>I think my only problem with it was that it was too much trial-and-error. There were chambers that were completely speed oriented so you couldn’t just do it and think about what the solution was, you had to almost do it 2 or 3 times to get the answer and THEN do it.</p>
<p>The storyline was really well written for a mod too, although without voice actors. I personally don’t feel that brought it down though. I think having the next-door neighbor try to voice act for you would have come off much much worse.</p>
<p>I definitely put this on the top of amazing mods. If you want a decent story, more challenging puzzles, and a plot that isn’t pulled down too terribly by horrible voice acting that rips apart most low quality mods, get it.</p>
<p>With that, I also recommend the Portal Flash Map Pack. No storyline, but more of the extremely difficult puzzles and a new boss battle at the end that isn’t the usual Glados battle.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I played Dear Esther got about 10 minutes in and couldn’t handle how bored I was and got rid of it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>As for Portal Prelude, It was just too hard; im all for hard games but not like that. Mistake, Azure Sheep, Poke646, Paranoia, They Hunger, Heart Of Evil, Point Of View are all great mods, I really havn’t played a really good HL2 mod yet though. (I mean a free downloadable one, not things like TF2/CSS)</p>

            <p>I really loved Portal: Prelude. It’s test chamber design is so excellent that it makes Portal’s test chambers look really really simple and i daresay, boring. The way the story unfolded and the ability to explore the office spaces was pretty enjoyable too.</p>
<p>I seriously believe Portal would have been 10 times better if they had added some of the Prelude style test chambers. And i recommend it to anyone who has played Portal.</p>

            <p>Random quest and The Citizen, the latter has rather odd voice acting but is pretty mind blowing.<br>
(and they both take only ~30 minutes to download :p)</p>

            <p>I may be strange, but I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.planetphillip.com/posts/mistake-half-life/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Mistake</a> just because it took a more patient and psychological approach, which is pretty rare on the HL1 engine. Similarly, <a href="https://paranoia.level-design.ru/index_eng.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Paranoia</a> really stood out. These express just how different a Half-Life experience can be in a mod.</p>
<p>Sweet-Half-Life and Nuclear Winter were great fun to play through, but I wouldn’t label them as iconic.</p>

            <p>Iconic mods… well let’s see.</p>
<p>Research and Development was really really fun, I think Valve could take some pointers from it with regards to puzzles. Currently my favourite singleplayer mod.</p>
<p>Neotokyo is possibly the most polished and extensive mods I’ve ever seen, incredible soundtrack, it’s beautiful and very fun to play. Currently my favourite multiplayer mod.</p>
<p>Dear Esther is more art than it is a mod, it’s so abstract and moody, and yet it’s technically very simple. The voice acting is mind-blowing, as is the writing.</p>
<p>Goldeneye: Source goes without saying really, very nostalgic and fun to play but has a small player base mainly due to confusion over the current version (beta 3.1) and that their website is in disrepair. Anyone who loved Goldeneye 64 will love this.</p>
<p>Curse isn’t so compelling despite the hype, but worth checking out all the same, it’s beautiful but very short… and the combat feature is really just too much of a gimmick to be interesting.</p>

            <p>Recently I had the good fortune to play two mods that really helped change my look on gaming as a whole. I’ve always been interested in psychology and how you can get to a really deep level with games as an art form. Both Radiator and Dear Esther adressed this in a way that really hit me and I can only say that you really have to play them to see them for what they are. Also I recommend looking at Korsakovia, made by the same guys who made Dear Esther.</p>
<p>So, are there any mods that you think changed your opinion of something or really blew you away?</p>
