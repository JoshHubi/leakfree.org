    <title>Do women have an adequate support network to help sustain a successful marriage?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/do-women-have-an-adequate-support-network-to-help-sustain-a-successful-marriage/5186</link>
    <description>It seems that today there are more and more women getting divorces or unhappy in their marriages. Relationship expert Shere Hite estimated that 97% of married women are unhappy in their marriages. So if you combine that with the 50 percent of women who marry that file for divorce, that would suggest that 99% of women are unhappy with marriage. So who can a married woman turn to for encouragement and positive support of her marriage? Are the only happily married women the ones who have been married for less than a few years?</description>

<p>Yes your right,  take how long you have been a part of the community (joined) and then subtract it by how long you were a useless person with nothing better to do but read other peoples conversations (lurker) and you get how valuable a member of this forum you are.</p>

<p>If your definition of “being a valuable member of the community” is being a dick on forums, then by all means you’re definitely right. I’m sure you weren’t yet again just a random person with nothing better to do, than to read-and-reply to my post.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Oh the irony.</p>
