    <description>1st) THE GAME, I LOVE IT~!
2nd) I&#39;m in a loop of explode and die, click mouse, loading game, explode and die.

After talking to the scientist who is stuck in the room because of the explosives, making my way around the outer corridor, the trip mine which is low in front of the steps around the backside is where it happens. I&#39;ve had to goto menu and reload the chapter twice now.</description>
