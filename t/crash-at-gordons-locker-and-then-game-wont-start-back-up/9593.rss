    <title>Crash at Gordon&#39;s locker and then game won&#39;t start back up</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-at-gordons-locker-and-then-game-wont-start-back-up/9593</link>
    <description>I was playing through, and wow it looked fabulous. While playing I got to the locker room and opened Gordon&#39;s locker and the game crashed when I walked inside of it. I thought it was just a random crash, so I tried restarting the game, and now it crashes before the main menu can load.  Attached are the original crash, and 2 start-up crashes. Best of luck, and I look forward to a response!
