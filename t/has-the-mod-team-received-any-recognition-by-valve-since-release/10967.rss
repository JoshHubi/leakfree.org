    <title>Has the mod team received any recognition by Valve since release?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/has-the-mod-team-received-any-recognition-by-valve-since-release/10967</link>
    <description>I firmly believe Black Mesa has been a better, more detailed Source game than any Valve title released so far, save for maybe Portal 2. (And even that is beaten by detail and level design.)

Has the mod team received any private or public congratulations/recognitions or anything in the past few days from Valve?

I mean I know that&#39;s easier said than done, and is complicated, but you all deserve to be hired by them. This is a AAA title, free or not.</description>

<p>this mod is worse than the original and you think its better than any source  game so far?</p>

<p>Or rather, <span class="bbcode-i">you think</span> it’s worse than the original. All comes down to opinions.</p>

<p>It’s supposed to be cheesy on purpose. I’m not a fan of it either, but I don’t mind it that much.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>the terrible rebalancing of the weapons, the weapons have been rebalanced so bad its not even funny. they nerfed so many weapons for pointless re-balances that dont even line up with half-life 2! the crowbar, now near useless, the MP5 and pistol have been nerfed, the enemies have been beefed up without reason. what did they think they would acomplish?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Keeping in mind that Black Mesa is based off of Half-Life 2…</p>
<ul>
<li>The crowbar is nowhere near useless</li>
<li>The pistol was only nerfed for two damage points</li>
<li>The MP5 was <span class="bbcode-i">buffed</span> except for the magazine size - it’s far more accurate, and has a higher fire-rate. The amount of damage is almost the same (it shares 6 damage per hit with the pistol, the HL1 SMG did 5 damage per hit)</li>
<li>While the Marine AI is ridiculously omniscient, the only enemy that was buffed a lot was the Houndeye, because Houndeyes in Half-Life 1 sucked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just about all the re-balancing goes a long way to make the game better. Half of the stuff you’ve said (both here and in your other thread) simply aren’t true - The crowbar isn’t useless at all, and your complaints stem from either you not knowing how to use it or from you not understanding how the game works.</p>
<p>Both in Half-Life and Black Mesa, you’re not supposed to be storming a group of enemies to fight them. It’s more pronounced in Black Mesa, but Half-Life shared that design as well. I recall you complaining about that in your other thread.</p>
<p>Overall? The game’s harder than Half-Life. The difference is, almost all of the difficulty in Black Mesa comes down to… Well, genuine difficulty. Half-Life was pretty good at this as well, but areas like Interloper were just unfair. The only unfair difficulty in BM comes from the soldier AI.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>some of the map redesigns were just pointless, i can get wanting some new things to do in half-life especially since the first didnt exactly break up that much scenery wise, but to add in pointless sections like in sector C that werent there in the original and nobody asked for is just ridiculous, plus the fact that some chapters like on a rail got cut and im sure people would have much rather had the time spent on pointless new sections go towards the existing ones.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>… Okay, you have no idea what you’re talking about, do you?</p>
<p>On A Rail was cut down because most players found it overly confusing and frustrating. Surface Tension was cut down because (if I recall correctly) the level designer who worked on it left the team, so what (s)he had finished had to be spliced to the start of Forget About Freeman (someone correct me on this if I’m wrong).</p>
<p>The added areas in Sector C or other chapters are to make the game make more sense. In Half-Life, you have an incredibly abrupt cut from the “lab” areas of Sector C to the drainage areas, and it’s jarringly noticeable. The bit with the elevator that the player enters, for instance, in Black Mesa, was added to make the transition make more sense.</p>
<p>Same with the labs that were added - In Half-Life, there were all of three side-rooms to Sector C’s upper area. It didn’t make any sense. In Black Mesa, there are at least three more that I can recall, making it seem more like a laboratory.</p>

<p>this mod isnt a remake of half-life. its what the mod devs think half-life should have been which quite frankly is terrible compared to the original with all the problems like rebalancing and changing enemy difficulty</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You need to learn what remake means.</p>
<p>If you hate Black Mesa so much, then go back to Half-Life. Or hell, Half-Life: Source, sounds like that’s what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>Hi Gabe,<br>
My name is orcone and I am working with the mod team creating Black Mesa: Source. I was just wondering if you had heard of us.<br>
We are still sort of in a state of limbo, waiting if we can get the OK from Valve to keep making the mod.<br>
It would be a great boost for the team if we could get word back from you about this issue, not to mention boost morale.<br>
Our website is <a href="https://www.blackmesasource.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.blackmesasource.com</a><br>
Thanks for reading, hope to hear back from you!</p>
<p>Thank you.<br>

<p>I didn’t because it doesn’t make any sense in terms of a complaint. Every game has parts that are easier or harder than other parts. The original HL had difficulty shifts like that, too. I had more trouble with any fight in We’ve Got Hostiles and Surface Tension than damn near anything else in that game. It just depends on the specific person playing how they fare.</p>

<p>Yeah, many of them had even worked on an amazingly high total of <span class="bbcode-i">0 games</span>! :hmph:</p>
<p>That’s not to say they weren’t experienced developers. In fact, the founders were very experienced. In operating systems.<br>
Now, I realize that even then, Valve were hiring from the modding scene, but not all of their employees at the time had experience, and some of the BM team have been doing this from as far back <span class="bbcode-i">as</span> Half-Life. They’ve got more experience than Valve circa '97-'98.</p>

If you’re wondering why I don’t say <span class="bbcode-i">how</span> this could have been done better is because I’ve a lot to write but I don’t have time right now.</p>

<p>I like those arguments.  Are you one of those people who wished that BM:S was in the Goldsrc engine too?  Probably would have boosted overall scores by 215019385%</p>
<p>I think it has some easily fixed things in it that don’t ruin it completely.  You make it out to seem that they butchered it beyond reason.  Many of those things you listed are simply playing style differences at fault.  The crowbar isn’t meant to butcher houndeyes.  It’s the headcrab/zombie killer.  It also breaks things.  If you played HL1 and ran around hacking everything down and LIVING…then I’m sorry…then the game must have been too easy.</p>
<p>Yeah the voice acting was corny, but I felt a lot of the HL1 voice acting was silly too.</p>
<p>On a Rail was long, repetitive, and quite honestly it was an annoying level for me.  I liked every single level in the original more than it…except Residual Processing.</p>
<p>Pleasure chatting.</p>
<p>Oh and list your top 3 favorite source games.  I want to see what they are.  Might be worth playing.</p>

<p>Just like in Half-Life, the weapons do less and the enemies have more. It doesn’t line up with HL2 because it’s not HL<span class="bbcode-b">2</span>. And it doesn’t have to, because the weapons in HL and HL2 are different weapons.</p>

</aside>
<p>The fact that you used Anomalous Materials as your example is just laughable, since for the entirety of the chapter there isn’t a single accessible room that wasn’t in the original.<br>
As for OAR, a lot of people hated the chapter, so they streamlined it.</p>
<p>I’m not saying BM is perfect, but it’s certainly a worthy remake of Half-Life, and it’s definitely better than most people can do, and better than basically anybody but the team would be inclined to. Basically, you’re just bitching about changes for the sake of bitching about them.<br>
Step off.</p>

<li>some of the map redesigns were just pointless, i can get wanting some new things to do in half-life especially since the first didnt exactly break up that much scenery wise, but to add in pointless sections like in sector C that werent there in the original and nobody asked for is just ridiculous, plus the fact that some chapters like on a rail got cut and im sure people would have much rather had the time spent on pointless new sections go towards the existing ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>this mod isnt a remake of half-life. its what the mod devs think half-life should have been which quite frankly is terrible compared to the original with all the problems like rebalancing and changing enemy difficulty</p>

            <p>I’ve read somewhere where some devs at Valve said that they didn’t play it yet.</p>
<p>And I’ve read in a forum that Marc Laidlaw did play it.</p>
