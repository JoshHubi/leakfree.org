    <description>I recently bought Half-Life: Source off of Steam. It was my first time playing the game since around the year 2000, and I completed it in three days. Anyway, it&#39;s hard to find mods for Half-Life: Source, and I wondered if anyone could point out any ones that are worth getting. Thanks in advance for any help.</description>

            <p>It’s boring and predictable and way overhyped.</p>
<p>Big name mods for HL1 (these at least I remember):<br>
Black Ops<br>
Poke646<br>
Poke646: Vendetta<br>
Point of View<br>
Invasion<br>
Life’s End<br>
Peaces Like Us<br>
Sweet Half-Life<br>
They Hunger<br>
Someplace Else<br>
Affliction</p>
<p>For Half-Life 2, the ones that come to mind as really good are<br>
MINERVA<br>
Mistake of Pythagoras<br>
Mission Improbable</p>
<p>…there are also a ton of small maps and mods for Half-Life and Half-Life 2 that are really good, but many of their names escape me.</p>
<p>EDIT: Human Error for Half-Life 2 was pretty good as well, and had a ton of original content.  The Citizen (Half-Life 2) has kind of a neat “homebrewed” feel to it, although I didn’t personally think that The Citizen 2 was as good as the first one.  Eye of the Storm (Half-Life 2): pretty, but unfortunately nothing revolutionary.  Hmm, see if I can’t remember a few more…</p>
<p>Don’t know how I was forgetting this, but for Half-Life 2, Dear Esther.  A THOUSAND TIMES DEAR ESTHER.  It’s an art mod, so don’t go in expecting action, but it’s absolutely fantastic; the first time I’ve ever thought of a videogame as art.</p>
<p>Also, check out <a href="http://planetphillip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">planetphillip.com</a> for all the Half-Life and Half-Life 2 mods you could ever want.</p>

            <p>^ Then you’re an idiot.</p>
<p>To actually answer OP’s question: if you bought Half-Life: Source, then you won’t be able to play most of the mods listed so far, because they’re for the GoldSource engine, which ran the original Half-Life.  Half-Life: Source, by contrast, runs on the… Source engine.</p>
<p>If Half_Life Source comes with the Source SDK and the SDK Base 2007, then it’s possible that you’d still be able to play source mods with it.  In which case, probably the best of the bunch is MINERVA by Adam Foster.  It was so good that he now officially works for Valve.  Also check out Mission Improbable.  Do NOT play Combine Destiny, no matter how many fanboys rave at you about it.</p>
<p>In years past, I would have been able to list many, many more mods, but it’s been a while since I’ve had a ton of time to play games.</p>

            <p>Ok, so to change a mod into a full game, all that is required is to include all the required code from the original game to make it standalone?</p>

<p>I would say that it is a modification to an existing game, as in still requires the original game to play.</p>

            <p>Hmmm I always thought of mods as being anything that runs off a certain engine, as each game would share similar code.<br>
I suppose that would be a little too generic, as then Mirrors Edge would be classified as an Unreal mod.</p>
<p>Correction is in order.<br>
So the exact definition of a “mod” is?</p>

<p>I’m wondering… do you mean:<br>
a) Mods for the gold source engine?<br>
b) Mods for that specific mod?<br>
c) Mods for source?</p>
<p>I feel like writing about the “a” option.</p>
<p>For starters I would suggest:<br>
Counter Strike<br>
Earth’s Special Forces (The final version is still in development and shall be awesome)<br>
Natural Selection (The sequel has a beta up atm (for source), stay tuned for the final release)<br>
Opposing Forces<br>
Blue Shift<br>
The Specialists</p>

<p>However, if you are referring to the actual modding of that mod, I don’t think that there is much out there for you.</p>
<p>There should be a few threads around regarding source mods. not sure if I’ve recently seen one for gold source mods for a while though. Perhaps some lurking is in order.</p>

<p>I’m wondering… do you mean:<br>
a) Mods for the gold source engine?<br>
b) Mods for that specific mod?<br>
c) Mods for source?</p>
<p>I feel like writing about the “a” option.</p>
<p>For starters I would suggest:<br>
Counter Strike<br>
Earth’s Special Forces (The final version is still in development and shall be awesome)<br>
Natural Selection (The sequel has a beta up atm (for source), stay tuned for the final release)<br>
Opposing Forces<br>
Blue Shift<br>
The Specialists</p>
<p>That should do you for a while <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>However, if you are referring to the actual modding of that mod, I don’t think that there is much out there for you.</p>
<p>There should be a few threads around regarding source mods. not sure if I’ve recently seen one for gold source mods for a while though. Perhaps some lurking is in order.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help! I do believe I’ve made a mistake in buying Half-Life: Source, rather then the orginal Half-Life. I managed to find some graphic-improving mods, but that’s pretty much it. Anyway, thanks for the help.</p>

            <p>I recently bought Half-Life: Source off of Steam. It was my first time playing the game since around the year 2000, and I completed it in three days. Anyway, it’s hard to find mods for Half-Life: Source, and I wondered if anyone could point out any ones that are worth getting. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
