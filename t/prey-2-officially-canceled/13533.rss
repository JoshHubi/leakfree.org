Kind of glad really. It started as a sequel to the first game and as of recently was going to be a spiritual successor to SS2 and I don&#39;t think related to the first game at all. They kind of imply they may do something with the property at some point so maybe this will turn out better than if this version of Prey 2 had been finished.</description>

            <p>I still want a game based on Prey 2’s original pitch. Maybe one of these days they’ll pull a Warframe and make a new IP specifically for the idea that fell through. Hell, they don’t even have to completely disassociate it from Prey. They could call it “bounty” or something and allude to bits of Prey’s characters and events but never go full on.</p>

            <p>Prey was twice as long as it needed to be anyway, so it’s almost like we have it already.</p>

            <p>This was going to be the new Duke Nukem Forever at this point. Probably for the best it was canned.</p>
