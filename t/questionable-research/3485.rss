    <description>Okay, Hi guys.

My mod is called Questionable Research (WIP TITLE). t is a Source sandbox mod that me and Spycrabz are working on. 

It is set in the BM facility and you can explore the whole facility. As you walk around the area there will be places where you can take part in activities such as:

Roleplay
Tram Racing
Car building and racing.
Fort building + defending with the forklift trucks _ crates

Please show your support by signing up to: [url]https://www.forums.questionablemod.tk[/url] . There is no homepage yet, just the forums (but Keresh is currently working on making a site for us ( :smiley: ).)</description>

            <p>Well I’ve not even looked at programming yet but if you know any good tutorials or anything that’d be great and I’ll have a go at it, then maybe in a year if it’s not complete I can help  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> .</p>
<p>Edit: Actually I may be able to do some concept art or forum moderating if you need anyone to do those.</p>

            <p>OKay, thanks. The main role we need filled is programming, considering that we are going to need lots of gamemodes constructed, we will need quite a few of these.</p>

            <p>I’ve signed up and will help when I can but remember that I’m just starting out so… I can probably only support by occasionally posting on the forum.</p>
