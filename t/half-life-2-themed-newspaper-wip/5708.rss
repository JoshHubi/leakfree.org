    <title>Half Life 2 Themed Newspaper WIP</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-2-themed-newspaper-wip/5708</link>
    <description>I am making this kind of parody newspaper cause&#39; I&#39;m bored and I decided to show you guys how it&#39;s doing so far. I know I&#39;m not that great at picture editing so please cut me some slack and only constructive criticism. You may notice how there are empty articles. I am going to make one more page along with these articles and I want YOU guys to make the stories. I mostly want semi-humorous references to HL2 but no refernces to DoD or TF2. Sorry. Please submit your idea on this thread and I will choose ones I like. No sexual content or swearing because a real newspaper wouldn&#39;t have those things. When writing it please take into account that Citizens who support the COmbine are writing this and will accept propaganda and false explanations to things such as murder. Provide a real good quality screenshot with the story if possible. [img]https://img188.imageshack.us/img188/26/city17times.png[/img]

*EDIT* By the way, if I do choose to use an article you made, instead of putting &quot;Citizen XXXXXX&quot; as the author name I&#39;ll put your username or another name for you, if you&#39;d please specify it first.</description>

<p>Combine logo’s the wrong way round.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I did that on purpose. It’s also a different color because I don’t want to be just using the regular Combine logo, I wanted to make a slight variation of it.</p>

            <p>update on anti-citizen <span class="hashtag">#1</span><br>
It has been reported that this citizen managed to escape capture and is now on the loose again.Reports of a strange weapon capable of picking up any object and throwing them at immense speeds has been confirmed.He has also gotten his hands on even MORE firepower,such as our OSIPR.Remember,helpling him in anyway,directly on indirectly,can and WILL lead to severe punishment.If you see him,please report him and taking on him is not recommended.He is heavily armed.Last sight of him is on a beach.</p>
<p>How’s that? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the criticism but I don’t know any modern newspapers that still use black and white pictures. And right now I’m still just entering the text, so I’ll be adding effects to it later. Anyway, right now I’m just trying to make it easy to add stuff.</p>
