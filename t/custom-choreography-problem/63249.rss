    <title>Custom choreography problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/custom-choreography-problem/63249</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

I made a custom .vcd choreography with Faceposer (the one in SFM).
Everything works right inside Faceposer : gestures, speech and lipsinc.
Rebuilding scenes.image seems to works well too.

My next step is to make it works in-game using Hammer.
For that, i use 3 entities :
- logic_choreographed_scene (the custom choreography itself)
- npc_citizen (which plays the custom choreography)
- func_button (which fire the choreography to be played by the npc_citizen)

BUT, in-game, after compiling my map, and when pressing the button : the choreography doesn&#39;t play.
Instead i have an error that says that my custom .vcd is missing from scenes.image.

I have tryed many things, and it&#39;s still not working...
Do you guys have an idea of what&#39;s going on ?
I know there is a trick or a workaround, but actually i&#39;m stuck.

Any help would be appreciated

Thanks</description>

            <p>I’m pretty sure that the game won’t load a custom scenes.image if it’s in the loose files, because it checks the vpk archives first. If you haven’t already, try setting up a custom/ folder and putting it there, and if it still won’t load your only choice is going to have to be to make a mod folder in your Black Mesa directory (Next to but not in bms/) and run the game with the switch<code>-game [mod folder name]</code> added to the launch parameters.<br>
Right now that’s the only workaround I think the community has found for making custom versions of a whole bunch of different files and scripts - hopefully the devs are working on a custom campaign menu for the workshop that will allow us to load custom files more easily.</p>
<p>EDIT: A while back I made <a href="https://gitlab.com/JeffMODProductions/mod_skeleton_bms" rel="nofollow noopener">a mod skeleton</a> to help people set up/show off the functionality of the -game switch loading; This is only tangentially related to your question but it <strong>does</strong> have working custom choreography if you end up going that route; feel free to download it and use it as a base/reference, though be warned that the one-click-installation on the Steam Workshop doesn’t support this method.</p>
