    <title>Not surprisingly: Intel GMA 945 Problems</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/not-surprisingly-intel-gma-945-problems/10145</link>
    <description>Hello there, and first of all thank you for making Black Mesa, it is very well made, and you have a great team of developers.

Now on to the bug report.

I am running Black Mesa on a 2.0 Ghz Duo Core Processor, and Intel GMA 945 Mobile Chip, and Windows XP SP 3. I have all the latest updates installed.

First of all, when I first installed BMS, I couldn’t run it at all, it would crash with a memory error. However, I have plenty of experience troubleshooting games, and after a little research added the launch options:

“-window +mat_forcehardwaresync 0 +snd_async_prefetch_priority 1 –noborder”

I also am using a config (autoexec.cfg) which I edited for best performance, and quality.

The launch options allowed me to get to the menu, however the same memory error causes the game to crash at the resonance cascade. If I start a new game at any point afterwards, the same error occurs.

Basically, I can&#39;t play at all after the resonance cascade.

There are also a lot of graphical bugs. I used impulse 101 to get all of the weapons, and literally all of them had the purple and black checkerboard texture. Soon after shooting off a few rounds, I get a blue screen...

I&#39;ll take some screenshots and post them here too. As well as some info from the console. Yes, I know my laptop is horrible, but I&#39;ve gotten some great gaming experiences out of it, and I&#39;m not going to be upgrading too soon.

Any help is appreciated.</description>

            <p>Thanks for posting this. Well, just as I expected :-(.<br>
As for test chamber - you could try FPS dropdown reduce fix I had posted here:<br>

<p>As for your config - there are a lot incorrect descriptions/usage patterns and useless or duplicate settings there. I could elaborate more on this topic if you’re interested but I’m afraid there’s no possible way IMO that would allow GMA 9xx to play this game at acceptable level.</p>

            <p>Oh and just as a note, the fps is ridiculous in the test chamber, no matter what the settings.<br>
It is always 2 fps, before during and after the cascade.<br>
And at several places it is simply too laggy for playing, so I gave up.</p>

            <p>I actually fixed the problem by adding “-dxlevel 90” to launch options, which fixed all of my problems, however it causes lighting problems (things are very dark, when they shouldn’t be) and extreme lag.</p>
<p>Now here is my autoexec, some of it I added myself.</p>

<p>mat_compressedtextures 1<br>
mat_compressedtextures<br>
// If set to 1, uses compressed textures for optimal performance. For those with graphics cards which have higher amounts<br>

<p>fps_max 20<br>
fps_max<br>
// Sets a maximum framerate cap, preventing your FPS from going any higher. Note this setting is not the same as VSync, nor does it dynamically<br>
// alter image quality to attempt to keep your FPS near the FPS cap. The default is 300 which is fine, however lowering this to match your<br>
// refresh rate, or an even lower value, may help reduce wild FPS fluctuations which in turn will improve the appearance of smoother framerates.</p>
<p>mem_force_flush 0<br>
mem_force_flush<br>
// If set to 1 forces the cache to be flushed on every allocation, which is not necessarily optimal but can reduce memory-related errors.</p>
<p>r_fastzreject 0<br>
r_fastzreject<br>
// If set to 1 activates a fast z-setting algorithm which takes advantage of hardware fast z reject for improved performance. If set to -1<br>
// detects your default hardware setting for this option. Initially this should be set to 1, and if you see any problems then set to -1.<br>
// NB! On slower CPSs the FPS is slightly higher with a setting of “0”, Possible values are:  -1 = Auto, 1 = Use CPU, 0 = GPU (video card)</p>
<p>cl_smooth 0<br>
cl_smooth<br>
// If set to 1 attempts to smooth the view after prediction errors, this can increase stuttering and so should usually be set to 0.</p>
<p>sv_autoladderdismount 0<br>
sv_autoladderdismount<br>
// If set to 1, the player automatically dismounts from ladders when the end is reach. If disabled, player must press the USE key<br>

<p>cl_detaildist 400<br>
cl_detaildist<br>
// Determines the range at which detail props are shown (e.g. grass, default 1200). The higher the value, the lower your performance as<br>

<p>cl_detailfade 300<br>
cl_detailfade<br>
// Determines the range at which detail props fade into view (default 400). Increasing this value can raise performance.</p>
<p>cl_maxrenderable_dist 400<br>
cl_maxrenderable_dist<br>

<p>r_propsmaxdist 200<br>
r_propsmaxdist<br>
// Objects fading distance. Reducing this setting can improve performance.</p>
<p>lod_Enable 1<br>
lod_Enable<br>
// If set to 1, allows the level of detail (lod) of objects to be gradually reduced the further they are from the player.<br>
// This should be set to 1 for optimal performance, or 0 for maximum image quality.  The difference is usually not visible.</p>
<p>//lod_TransitionDist 100<br>
//lod_TransitionDist<br>
// The distance at which the lod is reduced on objects. Higher distance = lower performance, but better distant objects will appear.</p>
<p>r_lod 1<br>
r_lod<br>
// [-8 to 8]: Determines the rate at which level of detail (lod) is stripped from objects as they recede away from the player.<br>
// The lower the value, the more detail remains visible on objects as they progress into the distance, reducing<br>
// performance but increasing image quality. In most cases the visual difference is not significantly noticeable.<br>
// Higher than 1 gives strange effects on props (consoles undetailed/buttons just a green bulb in mid air etc).<br>
// Higher than 2 gives strange effects on models in HL2 EP2 (eyes becoming empty holes instead).</p>
<p>//cl_ejectbrass 1<br>
//cl_ejectbrass<br>
// If set to 1, weapons eject shells as they fire. If set to 0 they don’t, which can improve performance during heavy combat.</p>
<p>//cl_show_bloodspray 1<br>
//cl_show_bloodspray<br>
// If set to 1, blood sprays are emitted from bullet impacts on characters. If set to 0, no blood sprays are shown<br>
// however blood marks (decals) can still appear. Disabling this can improve performance, but reduces realism.</p>
<p>r_decals 50<br>
r_decals<br>
// Specifies the maximum number of decals possible at any one time. Higher number = greater potential for getting slowdowns during large combat<br>
// scenes as large numbers of decals are generated. Reducing setting can improve performance in such situations, without totally losing decals.</p>
<p>//r_drawdecals<br>
//r_drawdecals<br>
// Decals are impact/scorch/blood marks on walls, surfaces and characters, made from weapons and spells. If set to 1,<br>
// decals are drawn. If set to 0, all decals are removed improving performance but greatly reducing realism (CHEAT).</p>
<p>//r_drawmodeldecals 0<br>
//r_drawmodeldecals<br>
// If set to 1, decals can be drawn on models, which are pretty much everything excluding walls and floors.<br>
// If set to 0 these decals will be disabled, improving performance during combat for example, but reducing realism.</p>
<p>r_drawparticles 0<br>
r_drawparticles<br>
// If disabled, particle effects - includes smoke, dust, some spell effects and explosions - will not be drawn.<br>
// This can greatly improve performance around such effects at the cost of realism.</p>
<p>crosshair 1<br>
crosshair<br>
// If set to 1, enables the crosshair, if set to 0 disables it. The performance difference is negligible, so set to taste.</p>
<p>mat_bloom 0<br>
mat_bloom<br>
// If set to 1, a ‘bloom’ lighting effect is visible on objects, softening their appearance. If set<br>
// to 0 this effect is removed, but performance is increased without a noticeable drop in image quality.</p>

// If set to 1 disables the Bloom effect, even if HDR is enabled. Can reduce the saturation effect of HDR and may boost FPS slightly.</p>
<p>mat_bloomscale 0<br>
mat_bloomscale<br>
// Determines the level of brightness of Bloom, even if HDR is enabled. At levels above 0 the bloom effect increases saturation and brightness.<br>
// The default is 1 when Bloom/HDR are enabled, reducing this to 0.5 for example can increase realism. Experiment to see what suits your tastes.</p>
<p>mat_bumpmap 0<br>
mat_bumpmap<br>
// a) Texture depth(0-1). Enabling (1) will increase detail of textures, but it is a bit costly to framerate. Disable for framerate gain.<br>
// b) When set to 1 enables bump mapping which makes flat 2D textures appear three dimensional. If disabled, textures<br>
//    will be loaded without bumpmapping and will appear far less realistic, however performance will be improved.<br>
// c) Models in Team Fortress 2 look weird when “mat_bumpmap” is set to “0”. No other setting seems to fix that <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>mat_fastnobump 0<br>
mat_fastnobump<br>
// Faster bump mapping. Not allowed in multiplayer if server doesn’t have cheats enabled. Can cause strange effects.</p>
<p>mat_specular 1<br>
mat_specular<br>
// a) If set to 1, uses specular lighting. If set to 0 materials will not have specular lighting<br>
//    applied to them for a performance boost but a slight drop in image quality.<br>
// b) Texture “coating”. This enables the shiny surfaces as seen in the DirectX 8.0 screenshot,<br>
//    but also may cause errors as seen in the DirectX 9.0 screenshot. Disable for a framerate gain.<br>
// c) Disables specular lighting. If you use disable bump-mapping, your character’s arms and weapon<br>
//    will look like they made of chrome metal. Disabling specular lighting removes that effect.</p>
<p>mat_fastspecular 1<br>
mat_fastspecular<br>
// Faster specular mapping</p>
<p>mat_clipz 0<br>
mat_clipz<br>
// If set to 1, uses an optimization technique to reduce what is drawn on screen for a performance<br>
// improvement. Note that some Nvidia FX card owners need to set mat_clipz 0 to fix rendering problems.</p>
<p>//r_farz 0<br>
//r_farz<br>
// Controls the far clippling plane, which determines what is not rendered when it is determined not to be visible to the character.<br>
// A value of -1 is normal, higher values can result in normally visible objects suddenly disappearing from view (CHEAT).</p>
<p>//r_drawRain 0<br>
//r_drawRain<br>
// If set to 1, rain effects will be rendered, however if set to 0 no rain will be drawn.<br>
// This improves performance in levels where there is visible rain, however realism is reduced (CHEAT).</p>
<p>r_maxdlights 5<br>
r_maxdlights<br>
// Determines the maximum number of dynamic lights visible on the screen. The larger this maximum, the more chance of slowdowns during scenes with<br>
// multiple dynamic light sources. Reducing this value can improve performance in scenes with multiple dynamic lights, such as in heavy combat.</p>
<p>//fog_enable 0<br>
//fog_enable<br>
// If set to 0, will disable fog in areas which normally have fog, which may improve performance at the cost of realism.</p>

<p>r_WaterDrawRefraction 0<br>
r_WaterDrawRefraction<br>
// If set to 0, disables all refraction - that is images which appear distorted under the water. This will boost performance<br>
// at the cost of realism, however you may experience some graphical anomalies on the water or even in the sky for some reason.</p>
<p>//mat_dxlevel 90<br>
//mat_dxlevel<br>
// Determines the shader version for special effects applied to materials. Options include 70, 80, 81 and 90 (e.g. mat_dxlevel 81).<br>
// This is similar to the -dxlevel switch in the Advanced Tweaking section on page 7. Using shader versions lower than the highest level<br>
// supported by your card will improve performance at the cost of varying degrees of image quality loss (depending on the shader version used).</p>
<p>violence_agibs 1<br>
violence_agibs<br>
// If set to 0 disables most gore when monsters are hit. Importantly, disabling this also makes monster<br>
// bodies vanish very quickly after death which can improve performance but reduce realism.</p>
<p>violence_hgibs 1<br>
violence_hgibs<br>
// If set to 0 disables most gore when human enemies are hit. Disabling this can improve performance but<br>
// also makes human bodies and various world debris disappear quickly after being killed/damged.</p>
<p>mat_softwarelighting 1<br>
mat_softwarelighting<br>
// If set to 1, uses only software-supported lighting. Image quality is not greatly affected, but this may increase<br>
// or decrease your performance depending on whether your CPU is far more powerful than your graphics card.</p>
<p>mat_blur 0<br>
mat_blur<br>
// If set to 0 disables certain blur effects in the game, which can improve performance and/or reduce annoyance.</p>
<p>r_shadows 0<br>
r_shadows<br>
// Disable(0)/Enable(1) shadows. Very helpful in gameplay. Disable for a framerate gain.<br>
// PS! Setting “r_shadows 0” also disables flashlight - could cause “minor” problems <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>//r_decal_cullsize 0<br>

r_modellodscale<br>
// (0-1) This setting is not the same as the Model Detail setting under the in-game options. You can use this value<br>
// to fine tune model details, with values below 1 reducing the model details, improving performance at the cost of realism.</p>
<p>ai_expression_optimization 1<br>
ai_expression_optimization<br>
// If set to 1, disables NPC expressions when you can’t see them, potentially improving performance.</p>
<p>r_occlusion 0<br>
r_occlusion<br>
// If set to 0, disables the occlusion system in the game, which can increase performance at the expense of image quality.</p>
<p>sv_robust_explosions 0<br>
sv_robust_explosions<br>
// If set to 0, explosions will be less spectacular, but this may improve performance around explosions without a significant drop in realism.</p>
<p>r_waterforceexpensive 0<br>
r_waterforceexpensive<br>
// If set to 1, the highest quality water will be used. If set to 0, performance may improve without a noticeable reduction in water quality.</p>
<p>dsp_off 1<br>
dsp_off<br>
// If set to 1, disables audio DSP (Digital Signal Processing) in Half Life 2. This<br>
// may improve performance (CHEAT), but will reduce the richness of audio effects.</p>

dsp_slow_cpu<br>
// If set to 1, reduces the quality of dsp sound effects, improving performance on systems with slower CPUs.</p>
<p>snd_mixahead 0.1<br>
snd_mixahead<br>
// Set between 0.0 and 1.0, the higher the value the less stuttering and more synchronized sound will be, but performance may be reduced.<br>
// A value of 0.5 to 0.7 will help reduce stuttering in the game at the cost of some FPS the closer this value gets to 1.0. Note that<br>
// altering this value can cause a quest bug in Chapter 5, so reset it to its default of 0.1 for the duration of that chapter.</p>
<p>snd_async_fullyasync 1<br>
snd_async_fullyasync<br>
// If set to 1, sound may go slightly out of synch with actions at times but you will experience reduced loading pauses and stuttering.</p>
<p>//fov 75<br>
//fov<br>
// Specifies the character’s Field of View (fov), i.e. the total angle which can be viewed at once.<br>
// Default is 75, higher values create more of a “fish-eyed” view, lower angles create a zoomed view.</p>

<p>Hello there, and first of all thank you for making Black Mesa, it is very well made, and you have a great team of developers.</p>
<p>Now on to the bug report.</p>
<p>I am running Black Mesa on a 2.0 Ghz Duo Core Processor, and Intel GMA 945 Mobile Chip, and Windows XP SP 3. I have all the latest updates installed.</p>
<p>First of all, when I first installed BMS, I couldn’t run it at all, it would crash with a memory error. However, I have plenty of experience troubleshooting games, and after a little research added the launch options:</p>
<p>“-window +mat_forcehardwaresync 0 +snd_async_prefetch_priority 1 –noborder”</p>
<p>I also am using a config (autoexec.cfg) which I edited for best performance, and quality.</p>
<p>The launch options allowed me to get to the menu, however the same memory error causes the game to crash at the resonance cascade. If I start a new game at any point afterwards, the same error occurs.</p>
<p>Basically, I can’t play at all after the resonance cascade.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of graphical bugs. I used impulse 101 to get all of the weapons, and literally all of them had the purple and black checkerboard texture. Soon after shooting off a few rounds, I get a blue screen…</p>
<p>I’ll take some screenshots and post them here too. As well as some info from the console. Yes, I know my laptop is horrible, but I’ve gotten some great gaming experiences out of it, and I’m not going to be upgrading too soon.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

</aside>
<p>Purple-black checkerboard is due to the game using dxlevel 80/81 renderpath with GMA 945. Read sticky FAQ thread (IIRC Question 6 or 9) to get info on how to switch the game into using dxlevel90/95 renderpath.</p>
<p>Blue screen - most likely misbehaving full screen post-processing shader.</p>
<p>Could you please show your autoexec.cfg file, I’m curious what commands do you use in order to get “best performance, and quality”. Next, dose the game start without having “+mat_forcehardwaresync 0 +snd_async_prefetch_priority 1” in the command line?</p>
<p>TBH I don’t expect that it’s possible to get BM working any close to the “playable” mark with GMA 945 - much more capable and powerful Intel HD 3000 can’t handle BM with a sufficient FPS to be comfortably playable - but I’m pretty curious about what are the main problems with the game running on THAT bad hardware environment as it could provide insights on how to improve experience for people playing on hardware like Radeon 9xxx.</p>
