    <title>Sequenz doesn&#39;t load in c1a3a</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sequenz-doesnt-load-in-c1a3a/11999</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m stuck at c1a3a. I entered the air shaft but when I exit it the soldiers are not talking or moving. I kill them and head to the scientist where I can find the shotgun. He turns to me but doesn&#39;t start talking.

I replayed the whole chapter, I reinstalled the game, .... I don&#39;t know what to do.

Can you help?

[code]

            <p>I redownloaded it via website linked here (not torrent) and I have the same issue. I deleted the BMS folder in sourcemods and reinstalled. Strangely when I loaded the game for the first time the save games where like 2 months old. I changed the video settings and when it startet again it had my latest save games in it. I loaded the save game till this point but the sequenzes didn’t start again… Any suggestions?</p>
<p>It’s funny how people freak out because of silly names and furthermore silly games. This is my nickname since 10 years and I wouldn’t change it because I switched to another game. People know me by that name. Seriously what’s the matter? It could have ment everything. Like the initials of a local sports club or what ever. People need to calm down…</p>

            <p>Before I went by Crypt I used Cod as in the fish. Glad I switched, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>On-topic, As Jack said, it’s almost guaranteed your files are corrupt. It said the choreo files are missing.</p>

<p>Oh sweet, that’s a warm welcome.</p>
<p>I downloaded it via torrent using the torrent from this site. I will try regular download and then install it again.</p>
<p>PS: This username was created when COD1 was out which is still a good game. But I have not played any COD online after laying COD1 to the side. By now I switched to BF3. Is that any better?</p>
