    <title>Is there any chance for guards to start picking up weapons on the ground?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-there-any-chance-for-guards-to-start-picking-up-weapons-on-the-ground/10086</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know this for a fact, but from observing their actions and comments, Half-Life guards seem to act a lot like Resistance soldiers in Half-Life 2. If that&#39;s the case, can they be made to pick up weapons lying on the ground when they&#39;re better than what the guard is carrying? At least restricted to conventional human weapons.

The reason I ask is... When a guard shows up carrying a magnum or a shotgun, I jump for joy because I know he&#39;ll be very, very useful. When a guard shows up with a 9mm pistol, though, he becomes more of a liability, at least against the bigger enemies. And when I see a guard armed with a 9mm step over a combat shotgun or an SMG, I end yelling at my screen to &quot;Pick up the damn weapon, you idiot!&quot;

Yeah, I know they didn&#39;t do that in the original, but in the original, &quot;Barneys&quot; were practically useless for anything but opening doors. Here, they come equipped, so they&#39;re always taunting me with their pea-shooters  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>i do think it was odd that they dont use other wepons… especially as the last guard you meet has a “personal armoury”  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I assume it’d be like the manual reload of the TOW missle launcher. You pick the weapon up and take it to a guard, he puts his pistol away and the new weapon appears in his hand.</p>
<p>I think this is a great idea and would love to see it implemented.</p>

            <p>Simple, make it so once a player walks over a weapon and does not pick it up because they already have it, then the NPC could pick it up.</p>

<p>There are also guards WITHOUT shotguns and revolvers, who I have to see step over shotguns and revolvers and SMGs without taking notice of them. Personally, I just feel it would add a lot to the flavour of Black Mesa to see the guards interact with the world even more than they already do.</p>

            <p>if there was a drop weapon command, then guards could be made to pick up all “dropped” weapons. You could drop your mp5 and then immediately pick up one next to it, for example. It’s dodgy and tedious, but it might work</p>

<p>The guards kept picking up the weapons intended for the player.  If the feature couldn’t work, than  it couldn’t work.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There aren’t that many guards in the game for them to steal too much ammo, and I don’t expect the guards would keep picking up weapons again and again. In Half-Life 2, they only picked up weapons they couldn’t have, and always SMG -&gt; Shotgun -&gt; Combine Rifle and never back. Marines drop so many SMGs and shotguns that there ought to be enough to go around. I was skipping ammo left and right by the end of the game.</p>
<p>I can see certain important weapons being a problem, such as the first time you find a magnum and all of a sudden the guard who let you in ups and takes it. Can there be exceptions, like things they won’t pick up or places they won’t go? The thing is, at one point I had four guards and two scientists with me. I’d have loved to arm the guards with decent weapons and maybe even have the scientists pick up a pistol or a chair leg or something  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>On a related topic: Do guards have static health, or do they regenerate if left alone? I ask, because if they get hurt, I wouldn’t mind sharing my med kits with them. Maybe add it as an option like view bob and the train dead man’s switch?</p>

            <p>That’s an easy fix, though; you just need flags telling the game environment whether the player has the weapon yet.  If they don’t, then the guard isn’t allowed to pick up the weapon.  You could also add an ammo threshold, so that guards won’t pick up a weapon if the player is low on ammo for that weapon.</p>

            <p>The guards kept picking up the weapons intended for the player.  If the feature couldn’t work, than  it couldn’t work.</p>

            <p>I think they disabled this feature to avoid guards taking the player’s ammo.  I didn’t run short on ammo, though, and I’d love to see this feature re-implemented.</p>

            <p>I don’t know this for a fact, but from observing their actions and comments, Half-Life guards seem to act a lot like Resistance soldiers in Half-Life 2. If that’s the case, can they be made to pick up weapons lying on the ground when they’re better than what the guard is carrying? At least restricted to conventional human weapons.</p>
<p>The reason I ask is… When a guard shows up carrying a magnum or a shotgun, I jump for joy because I know he’ll be very, very useful. When a guard shows up with a 9mm pistol, though, he becomes more of a liability, at least against the bigger enemies. And when I see a guard armed with a 9mm step over a combat shotgun or an SMG, I end yelling at my screen to “Pick up the damn weapon, you idiot!”</p>
<p>Yeah, I know they didn’t do that in the original, but in the original, “Barneys” were practically useless for anything but opening doors. Here, they come equipped, so they’re always taunting me with their pea-shooters  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
