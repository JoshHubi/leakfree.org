    <title>&quot;Dog Ears&quot; fried dough recipe?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dog-ears-fried-dough-recipe/12670</link>
    <description>So, folks, my dad is trying to find a recipe for a food that his mother used to make (she is no longer with us) and I&#39;m drawing a complete blank in my searching online.

The name for the food item (used by his mother) is &quot;dog ears&quot;. It&#39;s some kind of fried dough possibly in the shape of a dog&#39;s ear.  It is possibly German in origin but I&#39;m not sure.

I am at a loss for trying to find a recipe online so I was wondering if you guys (you&#39;re so worldly!) know what the heck &quot;dog ears&quot; are and where I can find a recipe.

I would be forever grateful!</description>

            <p>It’s almost certainly not it, but my Grandmother knows an amazing (and simple iirc) recipe for pretzel dough, it has sour cream in it, and is also incredible when wrapped around small portions of hamburger and deep fried that way. I could get it for you if you want though.</p>

            <p>I don’t know if that’s it or not.  I have showed my dad pictures of fried dough before but he insisted that wasn’t it.  But I’ll try to get him to follow that recipe to see if that’s it.</p>

            <p>thats it? You just fry bread dough? For someone that has been searching and searching for how to make it, I would have thought it would be more complicated than that. We used to fry pizza dough at the end of the night when I worked at a pizza place, and then cover them with sugar.</p>
<p>hrm… it does give me a hankering for fried dough now.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Bread Dough “Dog Ears”</p>
<p>1 or more loaves frozen bread dough (or homemade)</p>
<p>Grease the frozen loaves and let rise on a cookie sheet according to package/recipe instructions.</p>
<p>Once bread has risen, heat grease or oil in deep skillet. Carefully cut off chunks of dough 1/2" thick and stretch a little to make flatter. Be careful not to work the dough, as it will sink when you fry it.</p>
<p>Place the chunks of dough in the hot grease and brown on one side. You will be able to see the dough rising and cooking through. Then turn the dough and brown on the other side.</p>
<p>Place on dish and let drain. Serve warm from stove with butter, jelly, jam, honey, etc. Leftovers may be microwaved to warm.</p>

            <p>I asked my german hubby and he seemed familiar with the baking term ‘dog ears’, alas he was clueless as to what is in it, how to make it or what an alternate name might be. All he said is that he seems to remember it as being a pastry of some sort.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s all I know for certain.  Hence my problem.  There’s a pretty decent probability that the recipe requires you to knead the dough a lot; my dad seems to recall that step being the reason why my grandmother (his mother) didn’t make it that often.</p>

            <p>Yes, I know about elephant ears, hush puppies and the Wiki article, but I don’t believe those are it. It was specifically called “dog ears” by my grandmother.  It’s apparently not just fried dough but other ingredients as well, but I don’t know what or if it’s prepared differently or what.</p>

            <p>So, folks, my dad is trying to find a recipe for a food that his mother used to make (she is no longer with us) and I’m drawing a complete blank in my searching online.</p>
<p>The name for the food item (used by his mother) is “dog ears”. It’s some kind of fried dough possibly in the shape of a dog’s ear.  It is possibly German in origin but I’m not sure.</p>
<p>I am at a loss for trying to find a recipe online so I was wondering if you guys (you’re so worldly!) know what the heck “dog ears” are and where I can find a recipe.</p>
<p>I would be forever grateful!</p>
