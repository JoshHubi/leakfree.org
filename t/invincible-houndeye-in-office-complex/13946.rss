After turning off the power and breaking my way through the window, I found myself breaking more windows in the next area. I spotted this Houndeye. I know you have to face him later in the chapter but at this point he was just standing there and being untouchable.

I tried to shoot him but there is an invisible wall at the broken window.  I wasn&#39;t able to break any more glass from that window.

            <p>Yes,  I had a similar issue, crushed window act like the wall. The glass must be unbroken for the real easter egg.</p>

            <p>What Shask said is true. Houndeye reacted by turning around and then went right back to watching his little TV. I was able to kill him.</p>
<p>Also, I managed to break the glass by crouch jumping onto the sill.</p>
<p>Still, that invisible wall is little bit awkward.</p>

            <p>I had a similar issue early in the game when trying to shoot the zombie who crawls out of the sewer system and starts banging on the half open door (the scene where a door is between two sewer grates and you need to raise the water level to climb up to the opposing grate). Even though the door is open, the zombie couldn’t be shot.</p>

            <p>You can hit him.  You just have to shoot <em>right</em> above the bottom of the window sill.</p>

            <p>I can confirm that you can’t shoot it through that window.</p>
<p>However, I believe it’s intentional. It’s an easter egg after all. (He is watching T.V if you didn’t notice.)</p>
