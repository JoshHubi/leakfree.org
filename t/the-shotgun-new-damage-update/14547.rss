    <title>The Shotgun (new damage update)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-shotgun-new-damage-update/14547</link>
    <description>So im curious as to what people have to say with how the new  shotgun now gibs your  enemies.  I think the idea of seeing ragdolls fly backwards has a delightful appeal though.

IDEA, can it be made to have it reverted back to its pre update damage output? while instead making its &quot;secondary&quot;  double fire mode do the gibbing?  seems  a little more logical then.

Again, not sure what the design aspect was behind making choice but it just makes the weapon, to me, fell weird and not very retro now. thoughts anyone?</description>

            <p>The damage the shotgun deals to me is fine.<br>
The amount of damage that a NPC takes for the body to brake apart is to easy.<br>
I managed to disassemble NPC from a huge distance with the shotgun, which is way unrealistic.</p>
<p>The only way this would make sense if you shot an NPC right in front of you with single or double barrel shot.<br>
But i guess it’s okay as it is right now.</p>
