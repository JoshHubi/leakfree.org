    <title>Drum and Bass in your face!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/drum-and-bass-in-your-face/1095</link>
    <description>Check out my latest music track:

Download MP3: [url=https://www.hamsteralliance.com/music/2009/THA-solarphage.mp3][b]THA - Solarphage.mp3[/b][/url]

It&#39;s Drum and Bass of the loud and heavy variety. 181 bpm. The beat drops around 40 seconds in. My favorite part is the section from 1:25 to 1:56.  :smiley:

Also, here&#39;s an Audiosurf video of it: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBHv46w9Bkk]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBHv46w9Bkk[/url]

The sidewinder mode in AudioSurf makes my brain hurt, it&#39;s so hard to focus on the blocks when the track keeps shifting left and right. x___x</description>

<p>I read about the DnB sub genres on Wikipedia and I guess it falls under Darkstep, except that it’s pretty melodic, so uh… Not-really-that-darkstep.</p>

            <p>Hamst3r, I am really loving your songs! Just listened to :</p>
<p>Mode 7<br>
Deep-Fried Dropkick<br>
Making Contact<br>
Impact Event<br>
Linear Implosion<br>
The Fantastical Nikmis<br>
Speed<br>
Marble Madness Remix<br>
EZMHE Demo<br>
Attaining Liberation<br>
Slow Loris<br>
Supremacy<br>
EZMHE Credits HQ Mix</p>
<p>I must say that your work is easily some of the best i’ve heard in a long time.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  <span class="bbcode-b"></span> <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Your music is really fresh and original and I like the direction in which your newer songs like Solarphage and Making Contact are going. Mode 7 is a pretty good example of how simple electronic sounds can be converted into something magnificent.</p>
<p>I liked the three I just mentioned the most. I also really liked Impact Event, Attaining Liberation, Marble Madness Remix, EZMHE Credits HQ Mix, EZMHE Demo and Supremacy. They were pretty good!</p>
<p>The ones that didn’t really strike a chord with me were Slow Loris, Deep-Fried Dropkick and The Fantastical Nikmis. Although, TBH I think they’re good in their own right, they didn’t fit in much with the rest of the songs i just listened to.</p>
<p>But I must praise your work on the The Fantastical Nikmis, it really sounded like an electro-symphony.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>OK, well I had asked earlier for the song in the ‘ezmuze+ Hamst3r edition - Trailer 1’ on YouTube but i think that its a mix of EZMHE Demo and Supremacy, right? Is there any way i can get the version from the video?? Please.</p>
<p>PS: Keep up the great work man! And keep 'em comin!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT: Just heard The End Of Us All! and Reprimand of the Eternal Watchers and i really liked them both. Especially Reprimand of the Eternal Watchers, it’s like an epic movie score and definitely one of you BEST pieces!! </span></p>

            <p>Except it uses a gazilion gigabytes of memory when running.<br>
It’s even worse than Itunes.</p>
<p>And VLC is great for the fact it plays nearly every possible extention, and it’s low memory consumption. But it’s interface is shit.<br>
If you want all music in one place for easy listening, without the player taking up half your memory, just use WMP or WinAmp.</p>

<p>Check out my latest music track:</p>
<p>Download MP3: <a href="https://www.hamsteralliance.com/music/2009/THA-solarphage.mp3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">THA - Solarphage.mp3</span></a></p>
<p>It’s Drum and Bass of the loud and heavy variety. 181 bpm. The beat drops around 40 seconds in. My favorite part is the section from 1:25 to 1:56.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Also, here’s an Audiosurf video of it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBHv46w9Bkk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBHv46w9Bkk</a></p>
<p>The sidewinder mode in AudioSurf makes my brain hurt, it’s so hard to focus on the blocks when the track keeps shifting left and right. x___x</p>

            <p>^Ditto!</p>
<p>I just listened to Mode 7 and I must say I am thoroughly impressed. At first, when I read the description i was a bit skeptical as to “what four Nintendo Game Boy handhelds playing in unison would sound like”.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Man, the transition at 00: 30 was the best part of the song! Excellent work, gonna go check out some more… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Thanks, glad you liked the track! There’s a bunch of music on my site. Even a few packs, like the 1997 to 2007 torrent. There’s probably around 250 mp3s if you snag the packs and few individual mp3s.</p>
<p>As for that last part sounding a lot like the first part, they were identical. The only thing missing was a guy shouting, “reeeewinnnnnndddd” to let you know that the song just restarted. :fffuuu:</p>

<p>Well, the drumbeat was probalby the most generic D&amp;B drumbeat there is.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No no no, I already used the most generic DnB drumbeat there is in another song. This is more like the second or third most generic DnB drumbeat. Jeeeeeeez, get your generic beats straight!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
