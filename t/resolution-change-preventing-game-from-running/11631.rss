    <title>Resolution change preventing game from running?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/resolution-change-preventing-game-from-running/11631</link>
    <description>I had just installed and ran the game, and it worked flawlessly.  I changed the resolution to the next step up, I belive 1152 or so, and the game crashed right after.  However, now I cant run the game anymore, as it crashes trying to run.  (gives an error stating that it failed to create D3D)  I uninstalled, re-downloaded the game twice, and nothing works.  Any way to undo the resolution change from outside the game, or is that not even the cause of the issue?  Any ideas would be much appreciated! 

Thank you!

            <p>This is why I love moderators.  Sorry for being a scrub and posting in the wrong thread and that you had to move it for me.  But your idea to change the resolution from Steam worked perfectly.  Thank you again!</p>

            <p>Try to add the dimensions you want at runtime.  If you’re running it from Steam, right-click Black Mesa and choose Properties.  Then click “Set Launch Options”.  Then add the following to the box:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-w 1024 -h 768</code></pre>
<p>Substitute the numbers if you have a resolution that you know works ("-w" for the width and “-h” for the height) Then run the game and try setting another resolution.  If you get a resolution that works, go ahead and play or just quit out of the game, then return to the launch options and then remove the -w and -h parameters before running it again.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
