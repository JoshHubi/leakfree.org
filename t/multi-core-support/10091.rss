    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multi-core-support/10091</link>
    <description>I know black mesa source does not support it.. but didn&#39;t episode 2 support it? The game is playable at times but then i dip to the single digits in fps and I know it is just because of this issue.. will the game someday support it is my question? Actually im asking BMS to support it please! I have waited 8 years for this game and I do love it as I do half-life... but this stinks :/

multi core cpu 4 cores 2.66ghz intel
gpu - geforce 470 GTX - getting a 600 series asap.
4 gigs ddr3 ram

Portal 2  100+ fps. 
Episode&#39;s of half-life 100 fps+   with HDR 

I turned off all performance check box&#39;s in black mesa tab. 

One more question... how do I set my fps to be a constant 100 fps?

Btw black mesa team as far as that being my only issue DAMN GOOD JOB! -hardcore half-life fan since 1999  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>I played through the entire game with mat_queue_mode 1 (auto-enable multicore) and only had two crashes.</p>
<p>Also only had slowdown in two places: the garg chase right before you do the air strikes, and the final teleporter to Xen (those particle effects are REALLY slow).</p>

</aside>
<p>Playing through the first time with mat_queue_mode 2 i only had 2 crashes as well. My second playthrough had probably around 5 crashes, and now im playing through a 3rd time and its crashing all the damn time.</p>
<p>However i have reason to believe that the Black Mesa devs are working on a fix for multi core rendering because of how demanding the graphics are, and i also found a line of code in autoexec.cfg that says:</p>
<p>//exec threading.cfg</p>
<p>Threading.cfg does not exist anywhere in the BMS directory so i think it may be in the making.</p>
