After Half-Life 2 Episode One VALVe has decided to expand the Half-Life universe by adding the whole new organization &quot;Aperture Science&quot;. That trick makes possible not only to continue the Half-Life story but also reconsider it and even open a new ways of story continuation. In this theory I&#39;ve tried to explain the most important things and describe the possible future events. I really hope that the theory will be an Epic Fail, at least part 3 and part 4, because I don&#39;t want to know what will happen and don&#39;t want to lose my interest to Half-Life series.

[align=center][b]Part 1. Half-Life: the genre / An idea of teleportation[/b][/align][/SIZE]

The Half-Life and Portal series are science-fiction games and VALVe made everything in accordance with that genre. The whole story based on the main science-fiction idea: “Teleportation”. This is a crucial word in Half-Life universe. For example:
1. Stasis [slow teleportation]
2. The Combine invasion on Earth [Portal storms]
3. Gordon appearance in the train and then disappearance from the Citadel [Teleported by G-Man]
4. The teleporter in Kleiner’s Lab [Gordon was teleported from one place to another, the Citadel, the desert, somewhere underwater and Eli’s Lab]
5. The teleporter in Nova Prospect [Gordon and Alyx were teleporting for a one week from Nova Prospect to City 17]
6. Portal at the end of Half-Life 2 when Breen was trying to escape.
7. Nihilanth’s abilities [Teleport of his slaves, troops and so on; Also he can create Portals]
8. Vortigaunt&#39;s abilities [Teleported in the Citadel to rescue Freeman and Alyx, in Episode One]
9. G-Man appearance [We’ve seen him everywhere, of course he is not a fairy, he uses the teleportation technology just like everybody else]

As you can see, all these events, organizations and even characters are directly linked with “Teleportation”. Of course there are a lot of other things in the game such as anti-gravitation, advisor&#39;s telekinesis and so on, but the “teleportation” is the most important.
As a result, in the universe of Half-Life those who has the most cutting-edge teleportation technology always will take the leading role, will be unattainable for others, stronger and so on. Black Mesa and Aperture Science were trying to develop functional portal technology to win the race. Kleiner, Eli and Mossman, also were trying to improve the teleportation so as to defeat the Combines. The mankind was defeated because the Combines has powerful Inter-dimensional portal technology. But there is the most unattainable and influential person in Half-Life universe, G-MAN.
[align=center][img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11219057/g-man.jpg[/img][/align]
[b]G-MAN[/b]. VALVe devised that character who has the most cutting-edge teleportation technology. While the Black Mesa scientists used a huge stationary equipment and the Aperture scientists used a portal gun, G-Man could be everywhere without using a huge devices and other things such as portal gun, he is just moving from one place to another. It means that he has much more functional teleportation technology than Black Mesa and Aperture Science both. Someone has gave him that opportunities, let&#39;s call them as &quot;Employers&quot;, so G-Man is doing the job and to make it done the &quot;Employers&quot; provides him special opportunities. Without &quot;them&quot; G-Man is nobody or nothing, he realize that. G-Man must be trying to become as independent and influential person without any sovereign.

[align=center][b]Part 2. Nihilanth &amp; GLaDOS[/b][/SIZE]


[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11219057/nihilanth.jpg[/img][img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11219057/glados.jpg[/img][/align]

From Aperture Science history:
&quot;1998 – The untested AI is activated for the first time as one of the planned activities on Aperture’s first annual bring-your-daughter-to-work day. In many ways, the initial test goes well: Within one picosecond of being switched on, GLaDOS becomes self-aware. The &quot;going well&quot; phase lasts for two more picoseconds, at which point GLaDOS takes control of the facility, locks everyone inside, and begins a permanent cycle of testing. [u]Her goal: beat the hated Black Mesa in the race to develop a functioning portal technology[/u]. Days later, [u]that race is lost when Black Mesa successfully deploys an interdimensional gate through which an alien race emerges and effectively ends the outside world.[/u]&quot;

As you can see the main goal in the race is developing a functional portal or teleportation technology and then open Inter-dimensional gate. So the Black Mesa made it at their earliest convenience, but in what way it was achieved ?!

Crystal, the purest sample GG-3883 and the most unstable. The crystal is like a string between two worlds and it&#39;s a “key” for Nihilanth to open Inter-dimensional gate between Earth and Xen. Survey team in HEV suits already have been in XEN long before the Resonance Cascade. They were send to mine the crystals and during their expedition they has discovered Nihilanth. There were many dead Survey team members in XEN, their equipment is even in Nihilanth’s chamber. All these evidences about Nihilanth were concealed, only the government and the administration of Black Mesa knew about Nihilanth&#39;s existence. So we can assume that the sample GG-3883 was stealed from Nihilanth’s chamber during Survey Team Expedition and maybe that&#39;s why Nihilanth said these words: “Thieves… you all are thieves… you all are…”. 

G-Man has convinced some high-ranking officials in the government and the Administration of Black Mesa to afford for Nihilanth an opportunity of opening Inter-dimensional gate on Earth. Before that he insisted on substitution of crystal sample for the test chamber and then personally brought it. Everyone has agreed with him, paying no attention to consequences, let&#39;s just say that they all wanted to see how that thing (Nihilanth) is working, but nobody knew what will happen, except for G-Man.
[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11219057/g-man%20arguing.jpg[/img]

After the Resonance Cascade Nihilanth has began the invasion on Black Mesa, the government didn&#39;t want to be responsible for that experiment, they decided to localize the invasion on Black Mesa and kill all scientists because they are all potential witness. On the next day of the Resonance Cascade Gordon has launched a satellite into space trying to close the Inter-dimensional gate, but it didn&#39;t happen because the gate was under Nihilanth’s control. So after that the scientists has began to suspect what is really going on. One scientist in a Supply Depot said to Gordon Freeman:  “We suspect there is a immense portal created by the intense concentration of “Single Powerful Being”. You will know it when you see it. I hate to say this Gordon but you must kill it if you can.”

Gordon Freeman&#39;s role in the Black Mesa incident was as a &quot;scapegoat&quot;, the government declared him culprit, person responsible for incident. But he managed not only to resist with HECU soldiers but also killed Nihilanth and this is what exactly G-Man wanted. G-Man was impressed with potential of Gordon Freeman.

From Aperture Science history:
&quot;1986 – Word reaches Aperture management that another defense contractor called Black Mesa is working on a similar portal technology. In response to this news, Aperture begins developing the Genetic Life-form and Disk Operating System (GLaDOS), an artificially intelligent research assistant and disk operating system.&quot;

Two scientists divulged a secret Intel for management of Aperture Science that Black Mesa intends to open Inter-dimensional gate at the expense of Single Powerful Being (Nihilanth).
In response to this news, Aperture in a hurry begins developing a huge Artificial Intelligence as a Genetic Lifefrom and Disk Operating System (GLaDOS).

[align=center][b]Part 3. Episode Three &amp; The Borealis[/b][/align][/SIZE]

[align=center][b]Split in the Resistance[/b][/align]

Destroy or use it ?! Opinions were divided. As for G-Man, it seems that he is interested in destroying that ship. Eli and G-Man plans are coincided, they both want to destroy the Borealis. G-Man know that and then he decided to personally ask Gordon Freeman to convey Alyx Vance to White Forest, there are two reasons for that. First, G-Man wanted to relay words &quot;Unforeseen Consequences&quot; to Eli Vance. Second, he wanted make sure that Alyx Vance will see father&#39;s death before her eyes, the main reason is that Alyx Vance would be possessed by revenge and convinced of destroying that ship. 
Eli&#39;s death is the main reason why the Resistance will use the Borealis against the Combines because the enemy has managed to get all secret plans from Eli&#39;s head, so the Borealis is the last chance to resist. Kleiner still convinced that the Resistance has to use the Borealis. Judith Mossman is already in [u]Arctic base[/u] near the Borealis, she want to be first in that ship, as Alyx mentioned about her: &quot;she believes that it should have been her in the test chamber that day&quot;, Mossman full of resentment against Gordon Freeman. Alyx and Gordon are the only who want to destroy the Borealis, Eli personally asked Gordon to destroy that ship, moreover Advisors killed Alyx&#39;s dad and she definitely will accept his last favour.


[align=center][b]Electromagnetism[/b]

[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11219057/aurora_borealis_1.jpg[/img][/align]

On board of the Borealis we might find Single and Inter-dimensional portal technology. But there is much more serious supposition, it might be some equipment that could manipulate Earth&#39;s Electromagnetic Field and then teleport (as a Single-dimensional) at any desired places on the planet. But there is a huge risk to use the Borealis and EMF because it could destroy the ecosystems on the planet, the results are also could be natural disasters and climate change.
The only  reason why I&#39;ve choosed the EMF for that theory because it has some indirect links with the Borealis and it is also mentioned in different works such as Marvel Comic books or other science-fiction stories (Such as [u][url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Experiment&#39;]Philadelphia Experiment[/url][/u]), as an opportunity to teleport.

The Research Vessel is called as the [u]&quot;Borealis&quot;[/u] which is located somewhere at [u]north[/u], near [u]Arctic[/u] base. The Borealis is associated with &quot;Aurora Borealis&quot;. Aurora Borealis, also known as Northern Lights. The aurora is formed when charged particles (electrons and protons) are guided by the [u]Earth&#39;s Electromagnetic Field[/u] into the atmosphere near the [u]north[/u] pole.
The EMF is not an energy source, it&#39;s theoretically possible to teleport at desired location on the planet because the EMF surrounded the whole Earth.
There is an example in favor of this kind of teleportation. Siena Blaze, she is a mutant in Marvel Comics&#39;s X-Men comics series. The comic book writers devised that character who can teleport at vast distances by turning herself into magnetic energy, and turning back at a desired location. That trick is possible only through Earth&#39;s Electromagnetic Field. In Marvel comic&#39;s book the writers mentioned that each time she uses her power, she runs the risk of destroying the Earth. In the videogame X-Men 2: Gamesmaster&#39;s Legacy, Siena Blaze appears as a final boss in [u]Arctic base[/u].

[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11219057/Siena_Blaze.jpg[/img][img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11219057/Mossman_2.jpg[/img]

[align=center][b]Part 4. GLaDOS: Cybernetic race[/b][/align][/SIZE]

[align=center][img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11219057/revolt.jpg[/img][/align]
VALVe added a new organization in Half-Life universe (Aperture Science) but it is also possible that VALVe is going to introduce the whole new &quot;side&quot; among humans and the combines. (same as Gearbox added &quot;Race X&quot; into Half-Life universe)
Why Cybernetic race ?! Let&#39;s see:
1. Everything in Aperture Science is subordinate to GLaDOS
2. Everything in Aperture Science is completely cybernated and automated. 
3. GLaDOS has huge underground factories and the test labs.
4. Massive production of: AI weapons, AI military androids, AI turrets
5. GLaDOS has the most cutting-edge portal technologies

Probably Cybernetic race won&#39;t appear in Half-Life story at all, maybe only in Portal series, other games or expansion packs. Maybe that race won&#39;t appear in any games. But I&#39;m sure that VALVe has to introduce a new enemy/race which will make the Half-Life universe more interesting.

            <p>Apologys for the bump, but just wanted to add my 5 cents.</p>
<p>(SPOILERS AHEAD!)</p>
<p>After playing Portal 2, I noticed something interesting, Cave Johnson comments how Black Mesa has been stealing Technology from them. The validity of that comment can be disputed as well as the canonical value of the image of the Gravity Gun, and H.E.V. Chargers in the Portal Lab Rat comic.<br>
But this added with the picture of two (presumably) Black Mesa scientists standing infront of the Borealis makes me wonder to what extent what kind of communication has been had with Aperture Science and Black Mesa.</p>
<p>Maybe reading too much into it? Maybe it’s just a convenience. Thoughts?</p>

            <p>Ok almst everything in that article was really out there, but that is what velve lets us do, interpret their games in out own way, I could say that the halflife/portal universe and the Left4 dead universe are just parrelel universes if I wanted to, same goes for counter strike or day of defeat. Sure it might be dumb but there is nothing stoppoing those ideeas. The reason the Borealis dissapeared was because of the technology inside it, the super technology yet to be discovered. It is already obvious the technology has to do with teleportatrion, maybe even through time, maybe it teleported the borealis into the Space Between Spaces</p>

            <p>Pardon the necropost, but the whole cybernetic race thing is looking more likely than ever. From the ARG, it appears GLaDOS is infecting other computer systems like a virus. Plus, there’s the creepy “Tell them everything is fine” bit. From what I’ve seen from the twitter feeds and the infected users, Aperture brand androids are taking over peoples’ lives, Invasion of the Body Snatchers-style.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>You’re forgetting though, Dias, that Episode 2 takes place perhaps up to twenty years after the Black Mesa Incident. Certainly enough time to make a the story legendary in their minds.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, it likely disappeared a few months to a few years before the resonance cascade. It was during this period of time that Aperture Science and Black Mesa were competing to develop the first working teleportation technology. In theory, it could have happened anytime from the time Cave announced their project in 1976, up until GLaDOS finished developing Aperture’s portal technology, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/24/aperture-science_3a00_-a-history.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">which apparently happened after the Black Mesa Incident</a>.</p>
<p>However, it’s more likely that the Borealis’s disappearance happened prior to the cascade, as Kleiner, Eli, and Mossman would be more likely to know about it and cement its status as “legendary”. On the other hand, it’s also likely that it wasn’t too far in the past, as Aperture’s progress was not substantial until closer to the cascade. Also, it stands to reason that the Borealis’s disappearance could have been the result of a test that was poorly conducted in their rush to beat Black Mesa, or a failed test of GLaDOS’s, which would put it closer to the resonance cascade also.</p>
<p>It <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> definitely based on the Philadelphia Experiment legend, but its an Aperture vessel, so its disappearance would not be quite that long ago.</p>

            <p>It would have to be a good deal before the resonance cascade. If it happened at the same time, it wouldn’t exactly stand out enough or be old enough to be referred to as “legendary.”</p>
<p>I’ve said it once &amp; I’ll say it a thousand time It’s all based on the Philadelphia Experiment / Project Rainbow.</p>

            <p>From the way that they tell it in Ep2, the Borealis disappeared some time ago.  It became legendary almost.  I, personally, place the Borealis’ disappearance (as well as part of the drydock) to be sometime around the resonance cascade (possibly caused, in part, due to that).</p>
<p>But that’s my own little pet hypothesis.  Who knows for certain?</p>

<p>I was never under the impression the G-man had planned Gordon’s involvement, or his random superman complex he gains after the resonance cascade. I thought he thought of him as just another scientist.</p>
<p>The fact that he single handedly killed the Nihilanth could surely never of been predicted, even by the G-man.</p>
<p>No I’m fairly sure Gordon was a bonus.</p>

<p>Do we know when the Borealis disappeared? Before Half Life 1?</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the G-mans first attempt at a resonance cascade. Or he meant to make it disappear in order for it to be there by Episode 2. He’s pretty good at thinking down the road.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The exact time of the Borealis’ disappearance is totally ambiguous. I think it was probably coincident with another major event (ie. GLaDOS’ Activation, Resonance Cascade, Seven Hour War)</p>
<p>I don’t think Black Mesa could have been a ‘Plan B’. G-Man freaking adores Gordon :3 He’s too major in the Half-Life storyline to have originally not been involved, something G-Man would have totally forseen.</p>

<p>Why would they use a still docked ship for a teleportation experiment? Unless they were trying to transport it? To water? Never thought of that before.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Probably by mistake. The dry dock going with it seems like a small casualty to an unscheduled teleportation malfunction, ultimately wedging it in a glacier.</p>

            <p>The inclusion of the Borealis is the best cliffhanger for me. It makes me geek out more than any other HL story loose-end. I like the Aura teleportation theory. It seems… appropriate. Kleiner said that the Borealis was working on a ‘project of some promise’. I like the idea of the Borealis sailing in international waters to do all the illegally risky space-time ripping experiments, providing the bulk of the ASHPD research.</p>
<p>From the concept art, and the references that both games make to each other, I think we should get used to more crossing over. I would personally get PO’d if they just left it all hanging in the air, making large statements (which they have undeniably already made) then ignoring them.</p>

<p>Not sure, but he clearly wants something. Unless he’s like some giant dimensional 50 year old child playing with his toys. ( insert futurama reference I can’t remember )</p>
