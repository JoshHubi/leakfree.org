    <title>Impassable piston sequence on Residue Processing (bm_c2a4c) [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/impassable-piston-sequence-on-residue-processing-bm-c2a4c-fixed/10127</link>
    <description>A little while ago I posted a Help &amp; Support thread about being unable to get past the second set of pistons in Residue Processing (bm_c2a4c...right before the part when you hop down from one conveyor belt to another). Tried DOZENS of times but was getting insta-killed even after visually clearing the last piston (and definitely NOT actually getting crushed by it).

However, loading to an autosave a minute before this (right before opening the hatch to this area) seems to have fixed it; I got through the pistons effortlessly on my first try. Looks like this could be a small bug.

What I also noticed is that the time I got stuck, the second two pistons in this set were moving together at the exact same height, instead of there being a slight difference. No idea if that is related.

            <p>Cool, glad to know I’m not the only one who experienced this. Not a major bug I suppose, but hopefully it will be addressed.</p>

            <p>I too had the same problem. The first and second pistons were moving almost exactly in synch and it was impossible to get through the sequence. After trying for 2 hours I reloaded from the auto save and the pistons were staggered.</p>

            <p>I had the exact same issue as well. Did the same thing as you and restarted an earlier save, and got through with ease.</p>

Run into the first one so it blocks your path, then keep running.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what I did…must have tried nearly fifty times. Tried sprinting the whole way, sprinting half way, all different kinds of timing, and even after visually clearing it I was still dropping dead (and sometimes going flying). Half the time the last piston was still all the way up.</p>
<p>After going back to the autosave I practically did it with my eyes closed, and the timings on the pistons looked completely different.</p>
