<p>I just hope that the judge, jury, and trial are good and rational. These days, that seems to be a rare thing.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually, he’s not getting fifty years at all.  He has been sentenced to exactly nothing thus far.  I’m guilty of spreading this 50 years number around, but in retrospect, I wonder where it came from?</p>

            <p>I do praise you for providing evidence for your claims, Bolteh, and I see where you’re coming from in your arguments.<br>
Although I still think most of the fraud is invalid, since it’s really like saying a whole town should be held to blame over someone illegally selling drugs in a discreet manner. By the way, did anyone check out that link I provided for that one hour presentation on how piracy can be good? It’s a couple pages back I believe. Give it a watch, it’s long, but it gets into the juicy stuff fairly early.</p>

</aside>
<p>I never said he was being charged for running a file sharing site, I just said that, since MegaUpload has 100000000+ files on it, and since there’s not a big management of MU that I know of (what I mean by this is, MU isn’t like some huge office building, I think Kim runs it alone, let me know if I’m wrong though), it has to be hard to keep track of everything that comes in to the site, so I think the prosecution should keep that in mind.<br>
A pizza hut is easier to maintain what comes in it then a site that has millions of files uploaded to it everyday.</p>

<p>If Kim was the owner of a fucking pizza joint and committed a similar $500,000,000 fraud he would’ve been taken in as well, the pizza joint would’ve been closed down as well and he would’ve risked going to prison for 50 years as well.</p>
<p>How is this so terribly hard to understand?</p>

            <p>Wow, that’s just fucked up. Fucked up, and only fucked up, not exactly worth a crime sentence if you ask me, unless he put up the film on YouTube to disgraced her entirely, or something like that, then I don’t think he should get charged for it. Anyways, the prosecution should only focus on the MegaUpload charges, not what happened a few years ago. And 50 years for running a file sharing site with millions upon millions upon millions of files, making it extremely hard to keep up with whether they’re copyrighted or not, isn’t very just. I know he could have checked them out, but usually, file sharing sites that do that have huge offices, with hundreds of people on computers checking the files, but I don’t think MegaUpload was that big.<br>
To say that MegaUpload was built on copyright infringement really, well, ignorant. It was made on file sharing, just like RapidShare and MediaFire.</p>

<p>Where the hell did you get this from.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Many moons ago there was a documentary on Belgian television regarding the Gumball rally. It openly showed Kim (and pretty much everyone else in that silly rally) bribing officials, committing traffic crimes and hinted at the filming-hit-woman incident.</p>
<p>And during this whole Megaupload bitch-fest there were plenty of articles in Belgian papers regarding his criminal activities as well as mention the fact that he filmed a woman cringing in pain while mocking and degrading her instead of helping (or just calling an ambulance or whatever).</p>
<p>Like this one: <a href="https://standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=G2E3L7KCG" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=G2E3L7KCG</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“Tijdens de rally reed een vriend van Schmitz in Kessel een schoolopzichtster van de baan. De vrouw brak haar been en lag hulpeloos op straat, toen een tweede Mercedes met Duitse nummerplaten stopte. Juist, met Kim achter het stuur. Hij haalde zijn videocamera tevoorschijn en begon doodleuk het slachtoffer te filmen.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li>During the rally a friend of Schmitz hit a school supervisor in Kessel. The woman broke her leg and fell down helplessly on the street, when a second Merceded with German licenseplates stopped. Right, with Kim behind the wheel. He grabbed his camera and started filming the victim with great joy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as crimes against humanity goes, it’s not as spectacular as a Stalin or the shit Dilma Rousseff is about to do, but it’s still a crime against humanity as far as the pure definition of the term goes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s not true. The Internet is a worldwide invention. Why does everyone always seem to think that the USA invented everything ? Europe and Asia create things too you know…</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this communication technology (electronic signals through phone circuits) was created in the USSR for space missions (and then copied in the USA for space missions too and only for that. Copying is the only thing the USA’s government is good at. Isn’t it ironic that they chase after “pirate”-copists, when you know everything the USA copied in history?).</p>
<p>Those who then first developed it as “Inter-networks” to share data and knowledge were the UK.<br>
Only years later was it developed in the USA (only for the army though), and even more in Swiss and other countries (such as the Netherlands for browsers and Norvegia for CSS).<br>
Still, the most important developers of the Internet were in the UK (arpa and universities networks) and in Swiss (first worldwide server, http, www, html, …).</p>
<p>That means that the fathers of the Internet are the USSR (for the technology), the UK (using this technology to share data), Swiss (developing it and making it worldwide, convenient, and public), and a few other countries. What I’m trying to say is that no country can be considered the only father of the Internet. A lot of countries were involved in its creation, and the USA certainly were the less important of them…</p>

<p>“America” “Invented” Google.</p>
<p>Use it.</p>
<p>That must mean that NASA copied velcrow too!  omg, they did! FROM NATURE.</p>

            <p>Meh, what Maxey said. Plus, where did you get that crime against humanity claim from? He just doesn’t seem like he would do that, I mean, he looks so fat and jolly. But I don’t know him, so I guess I can’t speak.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say “full”, but yes, quite a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, if the Pope can get sued for crimes against humanity for “allowing” pedophiles to run rampant in the Church, then I believe this counts as well.</p>

            <p>OK!</p>
<p>I’m kind of shocked that people actually protest against Kim Dotcom’s imprisonment… That boy has committed fraud on a massive scale (see what I did there?) through Megaupload (amongst others) and has committed multiple other crimes (yes even against humanity) before this.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned they should let him rot away in a cell for the rest of his pathetic life. Along with the murderers, rapists, pedophiles and other wastes of human flesh.</p>
<p>The FBI didn’t take him in because his innocent site was powerless against the activity of pirates. The FBI took him in because he’s a criminal and has committed crimes in the USA (and against the USA).</p>
<p>Being angry because you have one less option to get shit for free is one thing, but saying that Dotcom is innocent is 20,000 steps too far.</p>
