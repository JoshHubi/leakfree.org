    <title>Can&#39;t launch BMS anymore? (CFileSystem_Steam::Init())</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-launch-bms-anymore-cfilesystem-steam-init/12460</link>
    <description>Hey,

I just started playing BMS yesterday and wanted to continue to do so today, but suddenly Steam is giving me an error when I try to launch the game:

[code]
CFileSystem_Steam::Init() failed: failed to find steam interface
[/code]

Does anybody know what went wrong here? I already managed to get the game started once and it was working just fine, so I don&#39;t think something&#39;s missing. I&#39;ve got BMS, Source SDK and Source SDK 2007 installed, and everytime I launch the game itself or Source SDK 2007 it gives me this error.

I&#39;ve also tried reinstalling all 3 components several times, but to no avail. Can anybody help me here? I haven&#39;t found anything regarding this problem via google, so you guys here are kind of my last hope  :stuck_out_tongue: 

Thanks in advance  :slight_smile:</description>

</aside>
<p>Try uninstalling source sdk base 2007, delete the folder of the same name from your account folder (if its still there), and redownload it to see if the SteamPipe version (the one that goes to the common folder) shows up. If it does, copy and paste it to your account folder.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if doing this will fix your issue though.</p>

<p>Well shit.</p>
<p>As it turn out, I dont have the uppercase folder in the “common” directory. So how do I get that? I downloaded it via steam and it only gave me the lowercase one in my user folder.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I think I found a backup of it, but now its giving me a different error saying that some file is missing. Im trying to reinstall the game right now.</p>
