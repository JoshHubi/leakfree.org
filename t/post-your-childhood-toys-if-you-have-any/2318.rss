<p>I had me one o’ these.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…shut up!  I loved that thing!  I just wish I still had it.</p>
<p>For those poor souls that were deprived of such a thing, it was basically like ViewMaster Video.  You get a cartridge you put into the container and there was a lens that magnified a filmstrip inside the cartridge.  Turn the hand crank to advance the frames.  Inside each cartridge was up to a 30-second video, IIRC.  If you turn the crank forwards, the movie plays forwards.  Move the crank the other way, it plays backwards.</p>
<p>…and before you attack its simplicity, I had a ball with it!  And it actually was one of the things that got me interested in a possible career in movies, which I’m working like a dog to get into.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>My plan is to, one day, work for Pixar or Dreamworks or some other such company doing computer animation for movies.  I’m not there by a LONG SHOT yet, but I’m working on it.  Hopefully soon, I’ll be able to get a job in a small movie house or something.  I can’t wait to tell people, “Hey, see that flag.  That’s my flag!  …third from the left…the blue one…Yeah, that one…  THAT’S MINE!”</p>
<p>I have lofty goals.</p>
<p>And it’s thanks to the Movie Viewer from Fisher Price.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>holy bleeping bleep that’s awesome!<br>
I still have the components to the lego star wars technic Limited run of the droid developer kit. not everything works mind you, and a few key parts have gone AWOL, not to mention that the motor piece is defective after a decade of ill-use. I have it with the full intentions of unloading it upon my half-brother when he turns seven or eight.</p>
