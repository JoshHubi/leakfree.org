    <title>The Best Gunshots</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-best-gunshots/12358</link>
    <description>Hey guys!

I&#39;m new to the forums, but frankly I only came on here to share a sound pack I made this morning. I feel that it is really quite awesome! Now, what I did was take the existing guns sounds from Xalenor&#39;s pack (great job to him by the way!) and... well..... I just feel that they weren&#39;t quite &quot;wet&quot; enough. So, I &quot;HEAT-a-fied&quot; them. Of course, I don&#39;t claim any credit for the original sounds, but only my modifications of them.... I&#39;m not trying to take the piss!

Think about it, you&#39;re in these giant concrete, and often very large rooms underground.... gunshots are going to be deafening and smothered in long, trailing reverb! So, using some of my reverb and specializer software, I was able to give the shots that kind of realism.


I think you&#39;ll all enjoy these a lot! 
Also, if someone wants to make a video showing them off, that&#39;d be cool because I have no idea how to do that.....

That&#39;s a temporary link, as I&#39;m getting error messages while trying to attach files to this post..... odd.

Enjoy!

<p>id love to hear these sounds to. I have also been working on my own soundpack for BMS. I have found my most likeable sounds for all the weapons exept mp5 and pistol. I am still to find some gunfire sounds I like enough to modify to become my final gunshot sounds for the pistol and mp5.</p>
<p>I think I might end up using some battlefield 3 pistol sounds and see if any others suit the mp5. I am after crisp/clear Realistic weapon sounds as I feel the engine does enough job for reverb effects for diff sized environments.</p>
<p>Still curious to here the effect and atmosphere these sounds give the game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>The trouble with making firearm sounds for Black Mesa is that you need to get a neutral sort of echo on the shot. While there are large concrete areas, there are also tighter corridors and even vents, not to mention open areas on the surface in areas where naturally the shots would have a longer echo. Since Source can’t have different sounds for weapons outside versus inside, there needs to be a sort of reverberation middle ground, since the game does metallic/whatever effects itself.</p>

<p>It’d be better to say it’s not in by default. It’d be <span class="bbcode-i">awesome</span> if it was. As for the sounds, I’ll pass. I have my own soundscape background noises I just rigged for WGH/QE/ST/FAF. I DON’T want to re-record them…</p>

            <p>well, this is interesting. The description sounded a lot like something I wanted to do in the first place (but wanted to steer clear of propagation type stuff because saurce can’t really into what I want). I can’t check these out atm.</p>
