    <title>Win7 Steam Error</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/win7-steam-error/517</link>
    <description>Just finished the Win7 install earlier and I just went to start up steam.

It comes up with the update windows saying;

ERROR: Failed to find key

I search the steam site but no fixes are there, I posted a question as well, but its the weekend so I doubt I&#39;ll get a reply till monday.

Anybody know whats going on?</description>

            <p>But you fixed it wrong, therefore the other people didn’t fix it properly too.</p>
<p>Reinstalling steam is annoying and you don’t have to do it, I just wanted to clarify.</p>

            <p>Steam has been the a golden beacon for not having to reinstall.</p>
<p>When I was on the mac I copied it from format to format never having to reinstall, even when I moved to Vista it was fine.</p>
<p>It was just 64bit win7, I copied Steam over, but there was zero registry keys and Steam wasn’t making them on startup, so I reinstalled and it was good to go.</p>
<p>Really, I was hoping this thread would get a lock after I stated that i fixed the problem.</p>

            <p>Yeah a lot of the time you can’t just copy pasta program folders around, I thought that was common knowledge.</p>

<p>Actually dont worry guys, turns out there wasnt a registry set for steam.</p>
<p>So note to everyone, when you install Win7, you have to reinstall Steam with the installer, you can just copy and paste it like I did.</p>
<p>You can copy and paste for Vista and XP, but it seems no for Win7.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You dont even need to copy it over. You can just execute the program from the original location. Thats what i’m doing right now.</p>
