    <title>Are you a rapist? Apparently you should be....</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/are-you-a-rapist-apparently-you-should-be/6500</link>
    <description>Hailing from America, a prominent TV psychologist has somehow managed to link an increase in rape to videogames.

Despite offering no evidence at all, she made this claim as part of a news report entitled &#39;Is Bulletstorm the Worst Video Game in the World?&#39;

Clearly unbiased and insightful stuff there. A full report can be read here:

This also includes an email address if any of you nice people want to contact her to congratulate her on such thorough research</description>

            <p>I think informing parents about the content of games is a good idea. Blood, violence, sexual situations, foul language, etc, this information should be available if the parent desires it. And “M” rated games (in the US anyway) should be restricted from being purchased by minors. But, we’re already doing that so, it’s all good.</p>
<p>Parents are the decider.</p>
<p>As a filmmaker says, “If I can influence your child in 90 minutes and you can’t over 18 years…”</p>

Also, I’m not sure yet whether or not I’m going to let my kids even play videogames.

<p>Of you could just stop playing CoD on an xBox. Or just CoD in general.</p>
<p>Something to think about on banning your kids from video games; in many cases when you tell a kid he can’t do something, with or without good reason, it can encourage the kid to do it. I think that’s part of the reason I became a hardcore gamer. When I was younger I hardly got to touch video games so whenever I got the chance I obsessed over them. I pulled on all-nighter at about 11 on a friends gameboy. If you keep your kids away from gaming it might blow up in your face and turn them into gamers. I think a better strategy is simply to discourage, not ban your kids from things. Don’t give speciic punishments, just let them know what you approve and disapprove of. That was my parent’s strategy towards drugs and I’ve never even touched alcohol let alone cigarettes or heroin (I’m only 16 so I may be calling this one too early).</p>
<p>Sorry for the slightly off-topic wall.</p>

<p>There’s not, but everything <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> be in proper context. You can’t let an 8-year-old play an exceptionally gory and violent game and not expect repurcussions. Most children that age DO copy what they see because they’re impressionable and they do what they see adults do.</p>
<p>I do agree with the language bit, though I think parents should explain to the kids that they’re not words to throw around in public, or to say at all, if that’s the way they want to raise their children. But this brings us back to bad parenting: Parents typically don’t want to be bothered keeping an eye on their children.</p>
<p>I wasn’t even allowed to play M-rated games until I was 10 or 11, and the first one I played was Perfect Dark, which was hardly the worst game of the time. But by then I could distinguish that it had behavior that I probably shouldn’t emulate in my own life. And now I’m old enough to buy any game I desire to, and I can say that while I do get much more immersed in games than any of my friends, I still am quite able to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t really see the problem with gore. I’d draw the line at games like Manhunt, where the point of the game is to inflict pain. Typical shooters with a lot of gore usually don’t promote violence per sé.<br>
It all depends on the age of the child, of course.</p>
<p>And I definitely don’t agree that children playing certain types of games necessarily causes repercussions. If it’s just a regular kid without any mental issues or anything, I very much doubt that that would be the case, as they <span class="bbcode-i">are</span> capable of distinguishing reality from fantasy. They do it all the time by themselves.</p>
<p>Not letting children play certain kinds of games would be the result of other considerations in my case.</p>

<p>There’s not, but everything <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> be in proper context. You can’t let an 8-year-old play an exceptionally gory and violent game and not expect repurcussions. Most children that age DO copy what they see because they’re impressionable and they do what they see adults do.</p>
<p>I do agree with the language bit, though I think parents should explain to the kids that they’re not words to throw around in public, or to say at all, if that’s the way they want to raise their children. But this brings us back to bad parenting: Parents typically don’t want to be bothered keeping an eye on their children.</p>
<p>I wasn’t even allowed to play M-rated games until I was 10 or 11, and the first one I played was Perfect Dark, which was hardly the worst game of the time. But by then I could distinguish that it had behavior that I probably shouldn’t emulate in my own life. And now I’m old enough to buy any game I desire to, and I can say that while I do get much more immersed in games than any of my friends, I still am quite able to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.</p>

<p>So if you were a parent, as a sensible person and having an awareness of the media you could make a decision on what your child watches. You would know that watching a bit of Terminator when you’re 10 isn’t going to turn you into a psychopath, but it’s probably best to keep the porn tucked away somewhere.</p>
<p>This would be good sensible parenting, as whatever you eventually decide to let them watch or play, you are aware of it’s content. This is different from letting a kid play what they want with no knowledge or understanding, then blaming the people who made the stuff in the first place</p>

<p>letting your kids play (semi-) violent games != bad parenting (necessarily)</p>

</aside>
<p>I think the main point is people can’t complain about children being exposed to violence and sex in video games because the parents are entirely in control of what children can play. The chick who was speaking on fox said something like “and kids get on their father’s xbox and play games.” Now that’s just bullshit. Fathers probably make up a ridiculously small portion of xbox gamers. And they could simply put the discs to “inappropriate games” in spots the kid couldn’t get to.</p>

            <p>I know a lot of kids that play violent games and listen to music that has a swear word per every 5 words, and they don’t see messed up to me; this “video games leads to Jack’s Tribe in Lord of the Flies” seems like retarded conjecture to me.</p>

<p>My parents aren’t bad! They controlled my media! They didn’t start me out with Duke Nukem, at least.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
