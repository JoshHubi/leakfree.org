    <title>Sound issue when loading</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sound-issue-when-loading/10128</link>
    <description>Just now when I loaded a game from the starting menu, the sound went out. When the game loaded up only ambient noises were playing, nothing else. No footsteps, no gunshots etc. I&#39;ll retry and see if this re-occurs.</description>
