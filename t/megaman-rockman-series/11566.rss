    <title>Megaman/Rockman series</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/megaman-rockman-series/11566</link>
    <description>For nostalgia&#39;s sake, lets talk about all things (and all things to come.....) megaman

whether the series is dead or not, lets appreciate the gameplay and story/lore that we (hopfully) all know and love

i honestly hope capcom makes a megaman x9 that follows the template of xbla/psn/wiiware&#39;s megaman 9/10, meaning megaman x9 should use SNES style graphics

Or capcom can actually continue the series and make somthing that comes after the ZX series (a ZX3?) 
and may Legends 3 rest in peace.......

            <p>Huh. What a coincedence. I was listening to Mega Man 10 music.</p>
<p>As for cancelling Legends 3, Capcom, as a company, is ridiculously stupid.</p>

</aside>
<p>what may this cancer be?<br>
the corporate greed?<br>
or the fact capcom is now a american game-dev wannabee</p>
<p>such a shame japanese devs are loosing their touch…</p>
<p>but in the words of Encyclopedia Dramatica: <span class="bbcode-b">"Japan is the best example of “Not good as they used to be”</span></p>

</aside>
<p>Legends is technically part of the main series, its just at a far far FAR[/size] into the future  (according to Rockman Perfect Times, its set around 80XX…which is over 5600 years after the [color=lime]ZX series<br>
And i was pissed too when they canceled Legends 3 (and Megaman universe) but the final straw was when they took megaman (the orignal blue bomber from NES days) out of marvel vs. capcom 3</p>
<p>they could’ve done so much with megaman today, i dont care if it stays side scroller, because apparently megaman 9/10 did well<br>
not to mention a storyline still filled with mysteries (like wtf happened to X and zero before the Zero series; what became of the space elevator in X8?; will the humans/reploids in Legends ever unflood the earth???;  how did megaman (original) die and pave way for  Dr.Light/X and Wily/Zero to start the era of reploids)</p>
<p>and megaman ZXA had a cliffhanger ending, so you would expect a sequel or continuation, let alone [color=red]<span class="bbcode-b">A GAME</span></p>
<p>but capcom just had to be like EA/Activision and not only ruin megaman, but ruin resident evil</p>
