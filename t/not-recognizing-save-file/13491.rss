    <title>Not recognizing save file</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/not-recognizing-save-file/13491</link>
    <description>I recently had to format my computer, but I forgot to back up my save file before doing so. A friend got to the same point I was at and sent me his save file (it&#39;s a .hl3 file), and I put it in \Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS\SAVE, but it&#39;s not recognized in the game. What do I need to do so the game recognizes the save file?

Thank you!</description>

            <p>You need a .sav file (and possibly a .tga companion file, but I’m not sure if it’s necessary).</p>
