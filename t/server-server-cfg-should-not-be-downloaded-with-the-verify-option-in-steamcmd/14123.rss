    <title>[server] server.cfg should not be downloaded with the verify option in steamcmd</title>

    <description>Hello! Thanks for the terrific linux support in your dedicated server.

I&#39;ve been working on an automated server installer/configure/daemon tool for srcds based servers and I noticed one thing different with your platform over other srcds based gameservers.

server.cfg is in the game&#39;s repository when downloading from steamcmd, meaning, there is a default server.cfg sent with the gameserver files rather than default values inherently set at gameserver launch.

I understand the ease of editing a server.cfg that exists to your liking, but having it update every time a server is started can cause some headache for automation tools and persons customizing their own options. Verifying contents of the game cache preventativly is a good way to keep your server stable (at least, that&#39;s how I&#39;ve always launched my servers). I recommend server.cfg removed from the default directory tree and maybe placing a server.cfg_example or some other similar strategy to help with overwriting.

Of course, you guys can do anything you want  :wink:  . I can work around it if need be.</description>

            <p>Our server.cfg has what we consider to be the ideal setup and values. For server owners, if you want to avoid that, you can always rename your version of the server cfg to something else and then add it to the autoexec.cfg, so it overwrites the server.cfg we load on launch. That should work, should it not?</p>
