    <title>BUG: Unforeseen Consequences, No &#39;Tipped-Over&#39; Mainframe</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bug-unforeseen-consequences-no-tipped-over-mainframe/10760</link>
    <description>In [b]Unforeseen Consequences[/b], after crawling through a duct into a mainframe computer room, according to a walkthrough ([i]and playing the original Half-Life[/i]) there is suppose to be a &quot;[i][b]tipped-over mainframe[/b][/i]&quot; you use to climb through a hole into the next section.

[b]BM-BUG:[/b] The first time I got to the area and took care of the enemies, there was NO mainframe below the hole in the wall you need to climb thorough :brow:

Reloaded the save before I entered the duct.

This time, when I got to the wall with the hole, there WERE 2 mainframes BUT they were NOT tipped-over AND they disappeared when I approached :rage:</description>
