    <description>And I had tears when the credits began to roll and the violin music began playing. Holy shit... You developers really did it. I fucking love Black Mesa and I fucking love this game. I love you all, all the developers. I &lt;3 you all and I pray you somehow get compensated for doing this, either by Valve, or somehow. This was one of the best single player games I&#39;ve played all year, beyond a doubt. You guys are amazing and I can&#39;t wait until Xen. Then I&#39;ll play Half-Life 2 over again and ep1 and ep2. Fucking beautiful games and you guys recreated the beautiful beginning. I love you.</description>

<p>I think the music brought tears to my eyes because it took me back eight years. I remember hearing that theme when they just began working on the mod. It took me back to when I was a kid, back to my old Counter-strike source clan days… I grew up looking forward to this mod. Now it’s here. I really really adore you guys. I’d buy the mod if it were possible.</p>

<p>My exact same feelings, I added the end Credits to my phones playlist and listen to it everyday during my daily college commute. Brings tears to my eyes every time.:’(</p>
<p>And I also agree with all the shit that’s being released by AAA companies, they should take BM as an example.</p>

            <p>That is the thing about black mesa proper game developers take around 3 years to put out a game and even though it took them around 8 years to get this far it just goes to show you that a lot of game developers churn out crap in those 3 years of solid development.</p>
