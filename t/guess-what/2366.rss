    <description>Those of you who are regulers to the BM steam chat, those who chat to me I thought i&#39;d let you know that my P.C is now fucked. looks like the motherboard (this I am very un happy about) has gone so im gonna try reinstalling an old one while saving up for a rebuild, thanks to those who tried to help. And sorry DB I know you entered chat tonight to give a bit of expertise but this I feel may be outside of anyones help.

I&#39;ll take it to some It techs when I get paid for some Indepedant verification, but im not holding any hope, As I will be borrowing my dads laptop now, for the internet I wont be in chat, but on the plus side at least my post count should in increase..........

Silver linnings and all that.</description>

            <p>Ever seen a thermaltake PSU explode?</p>
<p>Because mine is pretty much under full load most of the time, it’s only 430W single 12v rail.</p>

            <p>I’ve accidentally killed a motherboard or two through fucked up bios flashes. Thankfully I only buy from trusted vendors who are very good about RMA, and reshipping back boards.</p>
<p>PSU failure is most common. I see a lot of failed ‘DEER’ power supplies come across my bench. I have never seen a failed Corsair PSU in my life. I’ve seen a failed OCZ, and I’ve even killed a PC Power&amp;Cooling unit, whose PSUs have been renowned as the top of the pile for years.</p>
<p>Ram and HDD failures are the most annoying because sometimes diagnosing such things is tricky.</p>

            <p>I killed a Motherboard once. Haven’t got a clue how, but the place I got it from replaced it with a better one (they didn’t have my old one in stock’) without charging me the difference. Score!</p>
