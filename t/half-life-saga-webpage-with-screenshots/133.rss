    <description>I posted it before and because I am such a braggart, I must post it again in case there is anyone in the universe that has not seen it.

And before anyone asks about it, [i]no [/i]I did not include Decay cuz it is too annoying to play by yourself just to try to grab screenshots of all the levels.

If anyone here wants to take on this project, I would be very happy to update the page to include Decay.

Now back to your regularly scheduled program.

EDIT:  May 11, 2009
Thanks to DinoThrasher... portal is now included on the page! THANK YOU DINOTHRASHER!!!</description>

            <p>Hmm… Good point, I did miss a lot of graphiti. I was mostly trying to just get through the game and since I had screenshot set to the mouse wheel, I just pressed it a bunch of times as I went. I’ll see what I can do later, but not right now. I need to get the decay pictures transfered and probably want to take a break before going back through.</p>

            <p>I may need you to go back to portal and gimme lots o graphiti shots.  I didnt find NEARLY enough in the first batch and to tell you the truth, I wanna have a whole link page dedicated to interesting graphiti and ‘off’ pics.</p>
<p>That is if you WANT to go back and do it again.  It is by no means a requirement!  The page is up with portal and I am happy with what we have!</p>

<p>You’ll also be happy to know that I’ve finished Decay :freeman:. I’m uploading those, but because you said “I like to just go crazy with screenshots” I thought I hadn’t taken nearly enough portal pictures so errr… The decay pictures are a bit overwhelming. :zip:</p>

            <p>Ok, I’m done. I sent a PM. Just waiting for the reply. I can still take shots of the two major portal mods (Flash and Prelude), and I can help you with those Decay shots. The two portal shots won’t come as quickly as the official ones, though, because the mods are much much harder and longer. Also, Decay isn’t working on my computer right now so I couldn’t just do that at a moments notice.</p>
<p>I took all the pictures with this setup:</p>
<p>1680x1050 resolution<br>
Maxed out settings<br>
No Crosshair<br>
Portal Render: 5</p>
<p>If I had known how to make the portal gun go away, I would have done that too at certain parts, but I wasn’t sure if that was possible or how to go about doing that.</p>

<p>Umm, not ‘probably,’ that is in fact exactly where they got the ‘Source’ engine name from. They were making tweaks here and there to the engine, and just removed the ‘gold’ from the name while they were working on it so as to keep it seperate from their already stable engine. ‘src’ quickly became ‘source,’ as the developers collectively found the name suiting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>cue important voice</em> Actually they added the “gold” to the old version, rather than taking it away from the new version. Gold denotes the release version.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I’ve beaten Portal, Portal Prelude, and the Portal Flash Map Pack.</p>
<p>Actually, I beat the first two in that list twice since I needed to listen to the developer commentary.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>So ya, I guess if you really need photo’s from them I could play through them again. I just bought L4D, but since it doesn’t actually have an end I don’t have anything to actually be doing with my time at the moment. I can also take video if need be.</p>
<p>Also, just to be somewhat helpful, I already have “Filezilla” installed for when I was writing a few Mario game walkthroughs for a friend for a website of his, so I can easily set up the FTP if you just give me the info.</p>
<p>Also, although I will not solo through decay to get screens for you, I will gladly co-op with you through it so that you can grab your screens. Just give me a warning if you want me to, since the last 2 times I’ve tried to get into the game I’ve blue-screened. I’ll probably have to go reinstall Decay.</p>

            <p>Rad site, I like the retro original Half-Life feel to it…  Definitely don’t blame you for not trying to go through Decay yourself, it can be infinitely frustrating.  I can’t imagine how anyone would beat it singleplayer, without cheating.</p>

<p>This is probably how the “Source” engine from Half-Life 2 got its name.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Umm, not ‘probably,’ that is in fact exactly where they got the ‘Source’ engine name from. They were making tweaks here and there to the engine, and just removed the ‘gold’ from the name while they were working on it so as to keep it seperate from their already stable engine. ‘src’ quickly became ‘source,’ as the developers collectively found the name suiting.</p>

<p>Well, you’re inherently handicapped by being female (not a sexist comment, it’s been proven that women aren’t as good at visualising spatial information as men). That being said, playing video games <a href="https://www.joystiq.com/2007/10/03/study-womens-spatial-abilities-increase-with-video-games/" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">has been shown</a> to improve women’s spatial abilities, so go play some Portal and maybe your reverse parking skillz will take a turn for the better! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
