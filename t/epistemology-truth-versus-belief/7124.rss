    <title>Epistemology - Truth versus belief.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/epistemology-truth-versus-belief/7124</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been reading a lot lately on the subject of epistemology. It&#39;s provided some very deep thoughts, and some real perspective on existence itself. I&#39;m really starting to see what some people mean when they say that the only thing we really know is that we exist. Outside that there is nothing that can really be known.

Everyone knows the famous Descartes quote &#39; I think therefore I am &#39; . I pose a question for folks in this thread. Is there anything else we can really know? Is everything else just an assumption?

Can anyone provide me with solid reason to say &#39;I&#39;m not an artificial intelligence running in a simulation?&#39; or &#39;I&#39;m just a conscientiousness subject to stimulus that shapes my thoughts&#39; ?</description>

<p>I want that kind of mind control, and I want it thoroughly marketed and enfranchised in every sector of entertainment. Especially adult entertainment. :retard:</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m sorry, but what do you mean that I “can’t verify” these things?</p>
<p>If you mention some sort of “outside” thing such as a matrix, a brain-in-a-jar, or any other thing you could possibly come up with., provide evidence of this “outside” thing.</p>
<p>You keep insisting that I “can’t verify”…but you can’t tell me what you would accept as verification.  I’m beating my brains in here.  It’s like you’re stating that what is isn’t and what isn’t is.</p>
<p>What more can I do?</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay, look.  Here’s the deal.  You provide me with what you want me to do and I’ll do it.  If all you have is the equivalent of “nuh uh!”, then I’m done.</p>

<p>Just because you believe you perceive a dog and people to confer with, doesn’t mean either exist per se. It just means you believe they do based on your observation. Since your observations can’t be confirmed or refuted, neither can your conclusion.</p>

<p>Person A2 does not see a stack of CDs. Person A2’s other perceptions are in direct contrast to those of persons A-Z. There are other persons who have similar “misperceptions” to person A2. These persons constitute a minority of the population. Person A2 and others are diagnosed to be “insane”, meaning that their sensory input is not reliable.<br>
Persons A-Z conclude through sensory data that person A2’s sensory data is not reliable. Therefore the assumption is flawed. Those persons’ sensory input is just as reliable as that of persons A-Z.<br>
Now, substitute persons A2, etc. for your A-Z. Suddenly, the “sane” persons’ senses are not reliable.<br>
So, what is insanity, anyhow?<br>
And how valid is anyone’s sensory input?</p>

            <p>You haven’t presented ANY corroboration at all.<br>
Corroboration would be information you receive from sources that ARE NOT your senses. You do not have any way of gathering this information.</p>
<p>You haven’t presented ANY evidence. Evidence to support content cannot be gathered from within the content, unless it’s self verifying. Since perception isn’t, there is no evidence.</p>
<p>All you have presented is more examples of what your are trying to verify.<br>
Mass amounts of unverified data from many sources is no more valuable than small data from few unverified sources. When the context is attempting to verify the source, the content holds NO VALUE AT ALL! What you are trying to say is that you have a lot of various content, but you are ignoring that the SOURCE is in question.</p>
<p>You have no corroboration, you have no evidence. All you have is poorly constructed argument from unverified sources.</p>
