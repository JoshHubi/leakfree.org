    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-engine-error-chapter-11/10555</link>
    <description>Hi there,

today i was playing BMS @ chapter 11 and when you go into the room where the three academic keep out because they are scared than the door closes and you get shot by a lot of opponents the games laggs extremely at me.

at the first time i died because of the lag and than i get a source engine error:

and short after this when you swim through the dam my hl2.exe crashed when i came up the water. the second time i slowed down and it worked but when you use the speed from the dam the game always crashes


best regards and nice game</description>
