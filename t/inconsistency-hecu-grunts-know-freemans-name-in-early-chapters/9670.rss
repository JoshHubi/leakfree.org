    <title>[Inconsistency] HECU Grunts know Freeman&#39;s name in early chapters.?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/inconsistency-hecu-grunts-know-freemans-name-in-early-chapters/9670</link>
    <description>HECU Grunts in early chapters such as We&#39;ve Got Hostiles use lines like &quot;It&#39;s Freeman! Get him!&quot; &quot;Squad, get Freeman!&quot;

It doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense. It should only happen in later chapters, after On A Rail where they know Freeman&#39;s name. When they have been tracking Freeman and know that he&#39;s killed lots of grunts.

In Half-Life it wasn&#39;t until On A Rail when you discover they have written messages on the wall.</description>
