Dear Hitman fans,
 We wanted to share this open letter with all of you out there eagerly awaiting morenews about what’s happening next in the franchise.
 At Io-Interactive right now, we are building the next AAA Hitman game  for PC and next-gen consoles. It has our total focus and we wanted to  take a moment to tell you a few things about it.
 In the next game you will experience a globetrotting Agent 47 at the  prime of his career – the apex predator stalking his prey across the  world, with the support of his long-term handler Diana Burnwood and the  whole of the ICA.
 The game concentrates on the core Hitman fantasy of using a wide  range of tools to take out a diverse group of targets across expansive,  exotic locations around the world. We are building this game on the  backbone of the Glacier 2 engine, using the best parts and what we have  learnt through Hitman: Absolution and drawing inspiration from past  titles like Contracts and Blood Money to fulfil the core Hitman fantasy.  That means we’re packing in an extreme level of detail on the largest  levels we have ever built for a Hitman game. We’ve adopted an open,  non-linear level design approach to the game, ensuring the game will  play out across huge, checkpoint-free, sandbox levels. Our aim is to  create living, breathing and believable levels which will allow gamers  to play around with the AI to create those unique moments every fan of  the Hitman franchise loves.
 Contracts Mode is back – you will be able to create and build  challenges by experimenting with the large levels and possibilities  within them. And of course, you can share them with the world and  challenge your friends or foes to complete your hits. Your rules, your  Contracts.
 You will also be glad to hear that we have removed 47’s magic pockets. We believe that’s all we need to say about that subject.
 As we get further into 2014, we will reveal more and get into much  closer contact with all of you. There are so many things we have planned  and we are extremely excited for the future of Hitman.
 Thank you all for your dedication. We will share much, much more in the coming months.
 The Io-Interactive Team

            <p>Oh, I got it. I was pissed about Eric Johnson taking over the role too.</p>
<p>Why are all of my favorite franchises screwing over their iconic voice actors? SC, Hitman, and even Metal Gear giving David Hayter the shaft. This sucks.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

Absolution wasn’t a bad game but it didn’t really feel like a Hitman game, so I hope that they make a proper one this time and from the letter it seems like they do, let’s just hope they don’t screw it up.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>That’s all well and good but whose idea was it to put all the stuff that didn’t belong into Hitman Absolution? I did enjoy the game much more than I expected to, and you could tell that some Hitman was wanting to shine through but I hope they don’t expect people to have confidence in them to make a good Hitman game now. This does make me kind of optimistic though. Some stuff that I think should be changed that I will probably tweet to them at some point:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Overhaul the entire disguise system. HMA’s system doesn’t work very well and just encourages playing the game like MGS or Splinter Cell rather than Hitman. I think that not being 100% disguised at all times is a good idea but it wasn’t very well implemented. You shouldn’t have to hide from people you are dressed up with even if in some circumstances it would make sense that they would know that you aren’t one of them. It isn’t good for gameplay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either entirely get rid of the instinct stuff (like seeing through walls and point shooting) or make the game first and then implement them. Yeah, you could turn those things off in HMA but it was very obvious that the game was made with them in mind and then the option to turn them off was added later so that if you aren’t using them you’re gimped. Especially the “blend in” part of it. Taking them away shouldn’t gimp you but adding them should give you an advantage, and the only way to do this is to add them in rather than make the game around them. Kind of along with this, bring back the map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned in the letter there, no linear levels and no checkpoints. These kind of go hand in hand. The few sandbox levels that there were in HMA were awful with checkpoints. They just don’t work with the level design. It seems like the linear level design was made so that they could tell story within levels, which also doesn’t work with Hitman. Levels should be single map sandboxes with storytelling (whether through cutscenes or other means) should be saved for between levels. You can have the occasional character talking and picking up bits of the story in levels that way but you shouldn’t be funneled through levels for the sake of story.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are really the three main areas that HMA suffered because of. If they address them this game should be solid. You could tell from HMA that they can make a good Hitman game but that they just didn’t, for various reasons. The engine itself seems very solid as well and capable of supporting some very cool things, so I hope to see more of that. I would like it as well if they didn’t give such a filtered look to the game but that isn’t all that important to me. HMA looked very good regardless.</p>

<p>Dear Hitman fans,<br>
We wanted to share this open letter with all of you out there eagerly awaiting morenews about what’s happening next in the franchise.<br>
At Io-Interactive right now, we are building the next AAA Hitman game  for PC and next-gen consoles. It has our total focus and we wanted to  take a moment to tell you a few things about it.<br>
In the next game you will experience a globetrotting Agent 47 at the  prime of his career – the apex predator stalking his prey across the  world, with the support of his long-term handler Diana Burnwood and the  whole of the ICA.<br>
The game concentrates on the core Hitman fantasy of using a wide  range of tools to take out a diverse group of targets across expansive,  exotic locations around the world. We are building this game on the  backbone of the Glacier 2 engine, using the best parts and what we have  learnt through Hitman: Absolution and drawing inspiration from past  titles like Contracts and Blood Money to fulfil the core Hitman fantasy.  That means we’re packing in an extreme level of detail on the largest  levels we have ever built for a Hitman game. We’ve adopted an open,  non-linear level design approach to the game, ensuring the game will  play out across huge, checkpoint-free, sandbox levels. Our aim is to  create living, breathing and believable levels which will allow gamers  to play around with the AI to create those unique moments every fan of  the Hitman franchise loves.<br>
Contracts Mode is back – you will be able to create and build  challenges by experimenting with the large levels and possibilities  within them. And of course, you can share them with the world and  challenge your friends or foes to complete your hits. Your rules, your  Contracts.<br>
You will also be glad to hear that we have removed 47’s magic pockets. We believe that’s all we need to say about that subject.<br>
As we get further into 2014, we will reveal more and get into much  closer contact with all of you. There are so many things we have planned  and we are extremely excited for the future of Hitman.<br>
Thank you all for your dedication. We will share much, much more in the coming months.<br>
The Io-Interactive Team<br>
