    <title>GameStop question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gamestop-question/11585</link>
    <description>Okay, so back when I bought my PS3 (August) I bought GoldenEye 007: Reloaded (great game, by the way) at GameStop, but they were out of cases for the game. Could I go back there with the game in the yellow paper case-thingy they put it in and ask for an actual case? Or would they think that&#39;s suspicious?</description>

            <p>Unless your receipt notes that you didn’t get a case then I’d imagine they just wouldn’t believe that you did not get one. Doesn’t hurt to call and ask, but I’m also not sure they would just have random empty 007 cases lying around.</p>
