    <title>Oh Man I am so frigging nervous</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/oh-man-i-am-so-frigging-nervous/2650</link>
    <description>The suspense is killing me i keep logging in to steam just to see when its out.

I am literally so excited right now I have to pinch myself to make sure Im not dreaming. This mod will single handedly be the most widely downloaded and anticipated mod I&#39;ve ever seen.

I loved most of HL1 so much a couple parts pissed me off but other than that a spectacular game. I thought i would never see the day that this game would be re-written into something so beautiful and magnificent. 

HERES OUT ALL BMS DEVELOPERS YOU WORKED HARD ALL THESE FOUR YEARS HOPE YOU HAVE THE BEST LIVES EVER!!

Insurgency Source is very cool just very hard. The code for this game will be literally error-less. This game is so complex I laughed to myself that anyone could convert it succesfully since many others have tried but failed. But... I was wrong. When I saw the trailer I couldn&#39;t beileve it was amazing I had not learned about BMS until Last year around September I was so excited until I got word that BMS will not be making an 09 release but I never gave up hope..</description>
