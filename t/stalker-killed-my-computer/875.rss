    <title>STALKER killed my computer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stalker-killed-my-computer/875</link>
    <description>I bought STALKER from EB games for $10 the other day (half price sales FTW). I installed it and it ran fine. Not a bad game I might add.

However, upon hitting a loading screen after a few hours of play the loading bar froze. At first I assumed it had frozen and waited patiently to see if it would sort itself out. 

After about 10 mins I was contemplating restarting the machine when I heard strange sounds coming from the tower. The loading screen dissappeared and was replaced with a blue screen of death that lasted not even a second.

At this point I was quite concerned and even moreso when the computer rebooted itself without any intervention by me. It went through the usual startup procedures but hit a roadblock when it couldn&#39;t seem to detect the hard drive. It then checked the DVD drive and when nothing was found there it prompted me to insert &quot;boot media and press any key&quot;.

I&#39;ve restarted the thing a couple of times and it hits the same thing. I&#39;ve interrupted the boot process and tried to find the hard drive, but all I see is the two disk drives. Nothing comes up in the BIOS either.

I can&#39;t seem to find my XP disk so I can&#39;t even boot the bloody thing, but I&#39;m sadly considering that the hard drive has just died on me.

So, has STALKER killed my computer or has the hard drive gone cactus? I&#39;m not to experienced with this kind of thing so I&#39;d appreciate any help.</description>

            <p>At the risk of sounding like a spam bot, the only tool I trust for checking out HDDs and in most cases repairing them, even when nothing else can, is <span class="bbcode-b">SpinRite</span> from <a href="https://www.grc.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.grc.com/</a>.<br>
Check out <a href="https://www.grc.com/sr/testimonials.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the testimonials</a> for some idea of the things it can fix.<br>
(And in case you are wondering, yes this has been around for nearly as long as HDDs, and hasn’t changed in a while coz there’s no bugs left to fix - he got them all already.)</p>

            <p>Recently, if you’re using Saegate, there is a range of drives that was recently brought out, 500gb ones but may be bigger or smaller too.  There is a 45% chance of them failing but if they do, you can send to drive to Saegate and they’ll recover the data free and give you a new hard drive.  My brother and I have these.  They both failed, his permanently but we maniged to save the data on mine.  They can go at any time.  Of cource if you’re not using one of these Saegate drives then disregard eveything I’ve said.</p>

            <p>All right.  Old drivers can overheat if they’re pushed enough.  That’s because they weren’t made to withstand all the shit we put them through nowadays.  The driver from my old DOS computer once crashed when it overheated from playing Dark Forces for 10 hours straight.  Newer HDD models, though more powerful, are built for that shit, and can withstand it.</p>
<p>As for the current issue at hand, the clicking sound definitely sounds like your drive is fried.  Not from overheating or STALKER, since it’s a newer HDD model.</p>

            <p>The motor in HDD suffers fatal damage over around 60-70C, over that and componenets that dont have the room swell, when that happens, they warp and crush each other. Its rare that a drive will go over 50-something-C unless something is seriously wrong with the drive.</p>
<p>Old drivers do tend to get a bit warm though,</p>

<p>I’ve taken the case of to get a better look and it appears that the strange metallic clicking sound I hear is originating from the HDD. Sounds pretty fatal to me. All the cables are in so I’m gonna try installing the thing in another system next.</p>
<p>I don’t think the motherboard is screwed because the boot process works perfectly and it detects the DVD drives fine.</p>

</aside>
<p>Instead of having to waste time taking out the hard drive and testing it to see if its dead or not, just use <span class="bbcode-b">Pc Doctor</span>. If you dont have it, download it. When you start it up go to “test hard drive” and do a full scan on the hard drive. If anything in the test fails then you certainly need to get a new hard drive.</p>

<p>If it’s caught in a house fire, yes, they over heat.</p>
<p>But in a normal PC in normal conditions, ie, not on fire.</p>
<p>A HDD is a spinning disk with a reader moving back and forward, even with EXTREME amounts of transfers they don’t overheat.</p>
<p>It’s just not how they work.</p>

            <p>IF your HDD’s overheat from normal operation then something is wrong with your computer, computer’s ventilation or you’re in a room that’s at like 60 degrees celcius.</p>
