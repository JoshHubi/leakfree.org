    <title>Gaming Habits!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gaming-habits/819</link>
    <description>Go on, post your gaming habits here!

1. They can be in-game,
2. They can be in real life due to a game (slightly odd).
3. Or they can be real habits that have become in-game.

Let&#39;s try and stick to number 1, as 2 and 3 are the crazy things that get people locked up in jail, with signs on their foreheads saying &quot;DO NOT BREED!&quot;.

So my example of a habit is reloading almost after every kill.

Also I have seen people that say &quot;lol&quot; when they can easily laugh???</description>

            <p>One big one I forgot to mention; when I don’t like a game very much I will get frustrated with it and stop playing it for a while. I got to one part in Farcry 2 where there was a mortar that got me every time I tried to help my buddy. I haven’t played Farcry 2 in a few months now.</p>

            <p>I hate hiding and taking cover. I like to go straight to the action even if I get destroyed doing so. Makes me very bad at Halo 3. ):<br>
When I was younger I would lean in the direction I wanted to go when making a tricky jump in mario games.</p>
<p>I always reload after taking cover or making a kill, even if enemies can still shoot at me.</p>
<p>I rub my fingers together and run my thumbs between my fingers every cutscene or other break in action. that one REALLY pisses  off my brother.</p>
<p>I have a habit of passing up the way I am meant to go and getting thoroughly lost and confused causing me to walk in circles repeatedly passing up the correct route.:retard:</p>

            <p>Heh, absolutely! I do the same as Samapico, going through the entire menu of each new game. I usually spend most of that time in the Video Advanced section sorting my graphics priorities.</p>
<p>As for Controls, I also spend a lot of time there. I try to universalize my controls. Many follow a layout I’ve picked up from TFC, but I have also been influenced by other games. Some games are difficult because they do not allow certain binds. I usually have a problem with the mouse wheel. (Scrolling down is usually reload.)</p>
<p>I am mildly eccentric: The spacebar is my walk/prone button, Shift is for ducking, and Ctrl is always jump. (Alt is for sometimes used, for sprinting, but I avoid it due to alt-tab.)</p>

            <p>If I am only allowed a set number of weapons, I usually have just a shotgun, a long range rifle, and 'nades. And then I am always in need of a nice spray to clear up some mid-range guy that I can’t reach.<br>
I am also recovering from reloading after every shot, I just sat on top of the apartments on No Mercy and set the game to continually create hordes with no special infected. It works real well, Unless you turn off the zombie limit. I had almost 170 zombies on that rooftop before my game crashed.</p>

<p>I have a tendency to set the controls to match how I had them in Quake1 - specifically, RMB = jump and space = crouch.  This can cause problems in some games however (Crysis Warhead dual wield anyone?) especially if they have one more common function than I have free mousebuttons…  (I have a 5 button mouse but most games can’t see one or two of them.)</p>
<p>I am also a pedantic explorer in enclosed FPS’s and like to ensure I have killed off every single enemy, preferably via sniping.</p>

<p>Guilty of this as well!  I also reload after every shot and use the same weapon as the enemy is using just so I can restock my ammo, and I never use a newly acquired weapon until I have enough ammo.</p>

            <p>I like to make commentary while playing a game, and since there’s no one around to hear it I’m basically talking to myself.o_0</p>
<p>if I wasn’t so young and if my commentary was actually funny, I might just make a bunch of LPs on youtube:O</p>

            <p>The all-lights-off thing, I did it once. When I first got FreeSpace 2 from a friend… The game looked just so fucking awesome (and it was), and I just had to play it completely immersed… in my cockpit…<br>
The game also has a LOT of controls… I had my awesome MS Precision Pro joystick, I probably spent half an hour setting all the controls before even loading a single mission. And probably spent another hour in the training missions, adjusting my controls as I learned about the HUD and stuff.</p>
<p>I need to repair my joystick and play this again.</p>

            <p>I have to have EVERY SINGLE light source anywhere around me OFF. I’ve also noticed i immediately change the control’s to the default HL2 set up in basically any FPS i play.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>The accents in Far Cry 2 sound pretty good, yet I have nothing to compare them to. My only beef with that game is the respawning time for the outposts/enemy encampments/whatever they are. As soon as you leave the area they respawn.</p>
<p>It sounds weird, but racing games have affected my bicycle riding. Now I always imagine a racing line on the bike trails and always lean into turns.</p>
