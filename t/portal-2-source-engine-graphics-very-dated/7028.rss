    <title>Portal 2, source engine graphics very dated ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portal-2-source-engine-graphics-very-dated/7028</link>
    <description>So am i the only one extremely disappointed by how the new source version looks like ?
The Problem isnt potal 2 alone, but if ep 3 or hl3 will be shown at this year, it will use the same or slightly updated engine version, and since it will also hit the consoles we will have 1 room levels once more.
The biggest problem with the new version of the engine is the size of the maps and they way normal maps are shaded. No specular shading makes every texture seem flat and you cant really say if they are normal mapped or not. Considering how normal maps are now used on everything in every good looking game its a huge drawback, especially for character models.

And as much as the map size dosnt bother me in portal 2, i cant imagine an semi open ended game like half life have 5mins maps, and considering there were no enemies on screen in that game, the resources and ram for use in consoles will be even smaller.
At this rate i dont know if i even want to see ep 3 be out this generation, i hope the either drop the multi platform crap, or get a new engine, since source is pretty miserable on consoles O_o

And before anybody says its not all in graphics, the size of maps will hit gameplay really hard, even the more open levels in episode 2 felt small for me, and i feel every valve game from when hl2 was released gets more claustrophobic.
Valve pls license cryengine 3 !</description>

            <p>How is that a defense for an outdated engine? If I released a computer that is a slightly updated Commodore 64, would you buy it? No, because its outdated, even if its got some nice updates that make it good for a computer made in the 80s. Its a stupid argument and you should stop making it.</p>

            <p>It’s not a 2004 engine.<br>
It’s a 2011 engine. Every new release Valve has made (with the exception of the Orange Box, being that the games in it all used the same version as each other) has had a new version of Source.</p>

            <p>I think people are failing to realize that it’s okay to criticize graphics. It doesn’t make you a Crysis Fan, and it doesn’t make you an idiot.</p>
<p>It certainly doesn’t imply that Portal 2’s graphics are bad, nor is it a bad game all together.<br>
I still play games like Resident Evil, Half-life, and street fighter. But I also like good graphics, and Portal 2 has them.</p>
<p>It’s not Crysis 2, but it looks okay. I definitely think the Engine has room for graphical improvement.</p>
<p>To be honest, this mod looks like it will end up being more visually sound. I often found myself noticing low resolution walls in Portal 2, and I noticed a lot of recycled ones too.<br>
It’s obviously due to the fact that this Mod has been in production for longer than Portal.</p>
<p>But when Black Mesa Devs, a nonprofessional team, out does Valve themselves in any aspect; why not criticize?  It doesn’t hurt anyone. I agree with Ry:lambda:n, Garth[/SIZE] and all the criticizers alike. You people all need to chill.</p>
<p>By the way Ryan, I would like to mention that you have spelled, “Philosophy” wrong in your Signature. Just thought I’d let you know.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Couldn’t agree more, Garth. I think style, detail, and a successful art direction(with some realism of course) surpasses “good realistic graphics” every single time if compared.</p>

            <p>Yeah. Where has he gotten this idea that no source game has ever pushed it’s limits? That’s just damn silly. Robert Briscoe says the way he makes a DE map is he makes it in insane detail that the engine can’t handle and then he slowly tones down the detail until it’s runnable.</p>
<p>And if Half-'Life’s next installment is really only taking so long because they’re spending all their time on graphics then I’ll be pissed as fuck. But of course that’s not the case because Valve has repeatedly said they value game quality of graphics quality.</p>
<p>And WoW is an entirely different Genre that really isn’t comparable to shooters. And on top of that just because others are worse doesn’t mean it’s okay to be bad.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@ryan</span> Portal 2’s style is the result of Valve’s art direction far more than the source engine.</p>

<p>On topic … I don’t think Source is outdated … I can see it’s life at least till next gen of consoles will pop up, what is in 2-3 years.<br>
And there was not game yet that used 100% of its capabilities.<br>
Not even Dear Esther …<br>
And that’s why I think next Half-Life is taking so long … they want to make sure people will remember it’s graphics.</p>
<p>This will sound too confident, but I think graphics “almost” close to Crysis 1 are achievable with Source. Something akin to Cryengine 1.75 :freeman:</p>
<p>And with Dota 2 cloth simulation it could look better than Modern Warfare 2 … Well I know … still not Battlefield 3 but graphics are not that important till they dont look like from ps2 era</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>:hmph:<br>
Do you realize that Black Mesa nearly breaks the source engine? They’ve even stated that they don’t recommend noclipping as it may cause the game to crash. That’s how close to the limit they have the mod. The Dear Esther mod can look nicer because there are no enemies or weapons. That frees up a lot of resources normally used on characters and AI. Anything remotly close to Crysis is not possible unless contained in tiny maps.</p>

            <p>Why do you assume that a sub-par engine leads to sub-par games?</p>

            <p>embarrassed for me ? why ? we don’t know each other and you are so funny sersoft.<br>
These forums are for everyone and I’m free to say my opinion till its with rules.<br>
What wrong I said ? saying that I’m retard and to stfu is easy from your PC right ? But I bet in truth you are fat,ugly and stupid to post something like that … actually your post is more retarded than mine.</p>
<p>Whats the point of your post Ryan ? We both agree that Portal 2 still looks good so saying my posts are stupid don’t make sense.</p>
<p>Yeah I wrote some nonsense like Cryengine 1.75 and that but it was just comparison.</p>
<p>I can post whatever nonsense I want like 5+5=20 … does it bother you so much ? You can think whatever you want about me but prove me that you are wise enough and keep it for yourself.</p>

            <p>Dotard, yeah just stfu bro. You seriously need to just stop posting. I feel embarrassed for you, you 18 year old.</p>
<p>And this thread is garbage. Portal 2 graphics outdated? uhh no? The game looks fuckin’ good. And runs even better. And i want to say i remember reading posts from people saying in this thread that they would like to see Portal 2 remade in another engine…</p>
<p>Why? Portal 2 looks awesome. And it being in source makes it look the greatest. The source engine looks the best for portal in my opinion for style and physics. It’s above and beyond. I don’t know why anyone- or <span class="bbcode-i">how</span> anyone could improve the game. Just leave it alone and enjoy it.  It’s not outdated one bit.</p>
<p>btw, the lighting was beautiful. Shattered glass windows/monitors effects too. Music and sound were also badass. It overall was a masterpiece.</p>

            <p>I dont think this looks like that much outdated:<br>

<p>I really can see less detailed Dx9 version of Crysis 1 running on Source engine.<br>
Do you know what engine is really outdated ? Look at World of Warcraft …<br>
Yet with Cataclysm it have better water,lighting,shadows and Dx11</p>
<p>Also games like Borderlands with cartoony graphics dont looks like Crysis and they are great on its own … Darkness 2 nothing special.<br>
Not everyone own high-end PC for 9999999999$ … I’m happy that I can run Portal 2 at max settings without lags</p>
