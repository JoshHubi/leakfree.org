    <title>Anyone know this Catholic chant. . . ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anyone-know-this-catholic-chant/1598</link>
    <description>so if any of you have seen the film Elizabeth The Golden Age, you&#39;ll probably remember those monks at the start singing that beautiful Catholic hymn. I was wondering if any Catholics here know the name of this song and somwhere online maybe where I can listen to it. this is of course assuming that it[i] is [/i]real and wasn&#39;t just made up for the film. When I first heard this song I thought it was beautiful, and really wanted to hear the full thing, so any info will be greatly appreciated.</description>
