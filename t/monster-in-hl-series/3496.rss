    <title>Monster in HL series</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/monster-in-hl-series/3496</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve play Half-Life-1 original game and notice that there&#39;re many kind of alien in BlackMesa.
It&#39;s known as usual that they came from Xen.
But in other games,opps and blsft, it&#39;s appear the other kind of alian ,race x.
if not xen, where were they come from? and who brough them here?
thought that it isn&#39;t black ops. :frowning:

            <p>Too bad. It was destroyed for a good reason. So the series would never be set there again.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not exactly, they did say that the nuclear explosion at the end of OF was canon but didn’t really mention race x. They’re probably like the Star Wars expanded universe, ambiguously canon until proven or disproven by Valve.</p>

            <p>I’m put off by the lack of facts in this thread and the terrible grammar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue Shift and Opposing Force were created by Gearbox as expansions.</li>
<li>Valve hasn’t outright denied their canonicity, since they can both be slotted into the existing Half-Life storyline without disrupting it.</li>
<li>Race X were something made up by Gearbox to give the player something new to fight. They were supposed to have come from somewhere other than Xen, but no one knows where that is. It’s useless to try and speculate but by all means do so.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The other games are NOT made by Valve. They belong to Race-X (another faction who came to Earth using portal storms</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He never said the other games <span class="bbcode-i">were</span> made by Valve. Also, you seem to be saying that the other games belong to Race X. That is definitely not the case.</p>
