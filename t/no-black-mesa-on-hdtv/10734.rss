    <title>No Black Mesa on HDTV?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-black-mesa-on-hdtv/10734</link>
    <description>I have my laptop connected to my HDTV via HDMI, using the HDTV as my main display &amp; the laptop as a secondary monitor.  I&#39;ve set up both so that they have an identical 1600x900 display.  No matter what settings I try, though, every time I launch Black Mesa, it&#39;ll show the blurred loading screen for about 30 seconds, then immediately cut back to my Desktop for a minute or two, at which point hl2.exe crashes.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Is there something I&#39;m doing wrong?</description>

            <p>I played through BMS on my HDTV via HDMI, so I can confirm it’s not a flaw in the game design.</p>

            <p>I would turn off display cloning so the two screens are not showing the same thing, then you can properly set the TV as the main display. (usually Fn+F7)</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Have you tried starting the game with these launch options?:</span></span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-mat_dxlevel 98 -w 1600 -h 900</code></pre>
<p>The above command “-mat_dxlevel 98” is ment for Windows Vista or higher ( Windows 7, 8 ) with a DirectX 10 graphics card or higher.</p>
<p>If you’re using Windows XP (DirectX 9), add “-mat_dxlevel 90” or “-mat_dxlevel 95” instead of “-mat_dxlevel 98”.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> Be sure to remove “-mat_dxlevel ??” from the launch options, once the game started fine and you are able to quit regularly, without a crash.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">You may also try to force the refreshrate on startup, if the above options don’t work:</span></span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-w 1600 -h 900 -refresh 60</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note 2:</span> Before adding the “-refresh ??” line, make sure that both displays (notebook / laptop and TV) are using the same refresh rate (60 Hz, for example).</p>
