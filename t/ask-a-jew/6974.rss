<p>Wow- thanks  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I try. About that messiah… It’s an answer that I’d like to know, too. I mean I’m fine if we’re supposed to focus on the current world- tikkun olam and all- but it sure would be convenient if Elijah showed up tomorrow in a flaming chariot and said,</p>
<p>“Yo, this dude is the messiah. Peace.”</p>
<p>Then he’d push some poor guy out of his vehicle onto the road in front of me holding two items. In one hand will be an olive branch, representing a thousand years of peace for the world. And in the other… a black box, containing what mere mortals can only hope to one day see:</p>
<p>Black Mesa attached to a shiny new copy of Half-Life 3 and Firefly Season 2.</p>
<p>And I’ll say, “Gabe, get up.”</p>
<p>Not likely, but hey- a guy can dream… And yes, that is how it goes in the Torah. I think.</p>

</aside>
<p>Alright, let’s take this piece by piece. My faith was perpetrated via interpretations of this text, yes- but again, since my interpretation negates the need for it to be factual, and since I’m not trying to tell anyone anything in the Bible happened in antiquity, then I don’t need to defend its validity as a historical text.</p>

<p>But, let’s get back on topic.  How do you rectify the laws of Moses in Deuteronomy and Leviticus and such wherein things like shaving sideburns or wearing of two different cloths or eating of shellfish is forbidden?</p>
<p>These are, supposedly, God’s laws so what shall we do in modern times?  Was that for only the people of Moses and Abraham?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Now this is an interesting question, one that many Jews wrestle with. Again, you’ll find my view much more passive than, say, a Satmar Chasid. I believe, as many Reform and Reconstructionists (and some Conservatives) do, that the Torah was written by man (or men), much like the Talmud, the Mishnah, and the other sacred texts of Judaism.</p>
<p>Having said that, I don’t take for granted the complexity and profound philosophical questions raised by the text. In my mind, surely the depth of the words and the fascinating puzzles and morality plays that occur are related to God and/or divinity. However, I’m not one to think God zapped text onto some scrolls.</p>
<p>Moving onto the laws, the laws of the Torah fall under two categories: religious and civil. Religious laws pertained directly to the religion itself and (conceivably) are meant to be carried out well into the future. Civil laws, on the other hand, were meant to be codified rules of conduct within the society, since the Jewish community was using the Torah as a document to govern their people.</p>
<p>The civil laws, for the most part, people ignore today. There’s a lot of talk about what to do if your cow wanders away, but we tend to ignore that sort of thing now. The religious laws are where we are divided as Jews in modernity.</p>
<p>It is my opinion as a Reconstructionist that no one should do anything according for their religion that they do not agree with, or that they do not find meaning, spirituality, or merit in. For example, I have no idea why the Orthodox wear a kippa all day since it is meant to be a covering while you pray, but I respect their right to do that if they find it meaningful.</p>
<p>Likewise, I keep Kosher-style (not Kosher, but my own flavor of the rules) because I find it helps me maintain my appreciation and awareness of my faith. To each their own- whatever helps you better connect with your religion.</p>
<p>I can basically sum up the entire point of the Torah (in my view) with the words “tikkun olam”, or “repairing the world.” Our root goal as Jews, as humans, I feel, is to help fix the world- do good deeds by helping the needy, etc. I feel anyone following this path in life, regardless of their religion (or lack thereof), is a-okay.</p>
<p>(Sorry this was so long, and I apologize for the lack of coherency- it’s late. Please ask if you need me to clear anything up.)</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So let me rephrase: Why does that matter for us as Jews? The burden of proof is on the Christians, not us, if they want to use something that supposedly happened to ancient Israelites to prove their point.</p>
<p>We’ve got enough persecutions from plenty of groups over the course of our history- Egypt is just believable since we’ve had plenty of worse things happen since then. If it’s not true, then meh- not really an issue.</p>

            <p>First, theres no muthaphukin’ bagels in your survey! WTF dude, you claim to be jewish yet there is no mention of boiled doughy goodness, or smoked fish for that matter.<br>
Second, I commend your bravery for putting this thread up due to the rampant anti-semmitism on the internet.<br>
Third, how old were you when<br>
a: you were given your bag of jew gold?<br>
b: given an active stake in the world bank?</p>

            <p>Egyptians may not have chronicled the alleged exodus, but they weren’t the only ones chronicling things at the time.</p>
<p>What evidence is there, beyond the book of Exodus in the Bible, that it happened?</p>

<p>Did you know that the Egyptians never systematically enslaved jews to build their pyramids, like it’s described in the old testament?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know why I’m bothering to comment on an internet forum about something so important to me, but I feel I can shed some light on this little shindig.</p>
<p>There’s nothing about Jews building pyramids in the Torah- you’ve got your timelines mixed up (pyramids were build around 2500-1800 BCE, Exodus supposedly happened around 1500-1200 BCE). There is, however, a book pretty much dedicated to the bondage and liberation of the Israelites called Exodus.</p>
<p>Whether or not it happened is largely immaterial to non-Orthodox folk. The Torah is meant to be an overlay to our modern lives and is meant to help us better understand ourselves and the world as we know it.</p>
<p>Having said that, there is no archeological evidence either way that the Israelites were ever enslaved in Egypt. That does not preclude the possibility, however; as Dr. Richard Freund, a prominent archeologist and scholar on the Middle East, has shown, there are entire conquered civilizations that have been hidden by the Egyptians due to an embarrassing history.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: those who inscribed on tombs inscribed the important and successful events of the past. Why would they describe a massive exodus of their slaves from their control? Ancient Egyptians had hidden other failures in the past this way, and they may have done similarly with the Israelites.</p>
<p>But, like I said, that’s largely immaterial.</p>

<p>I doubt he would answer that correctly if he was that small. He would probably try to go for width.</p>

</aside>
<p>it’s more like asking you a straight-forward question (to which the answer is no, apparently)</p>
<p>also i’d think supposed systematic slavery of jews who are then freed by another jew directly relates to jewry</p>
