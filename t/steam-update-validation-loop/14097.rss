    <title>Steam Update Validation Loop?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-update-validation-loop/14097</link>
    <description>Hey, I was wondering if anyone has been having this problem when trying to install patch 0.0.2 on Steam where the installation just keeps re-validating and not actually installing? Its been like this for a couple of hours now, and I was wondering if anyone was having the same problem?</description>

            <p>I did disable everything, I even force quitted it from Task Manager. That way was the only fix I found.</p>

            <p>Did you disable all of Norton Antivirus? I use McAfee and I always need to turn of active scanning (the part that scans files you download) and sometimes the firewall when a big Steam game update goes through the installation/verification process.</p>

            <p>I figured out a fix, but unfortunately I had to pull a drastic measure: the only way(currently known) is to uninstall Black Mesa and re-install it from Steam. So I suggest if anyone else should have this same problem and adding the exception doesnâ€™t work, backup your save files and try again.</p>

            <p>This is a problem with Norton Anti-Virus giving a false positive for vlocalize.exe. Turn off Norton for the update or add an exception. I hope that helps.</p>
