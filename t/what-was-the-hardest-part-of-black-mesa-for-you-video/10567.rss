    <description>For me, my number 1 was definitely the part in Surface Tension where the VTOL dropship kept dumping HECU in the middle of the field. It literally took me almost 2 hours to get past that part. I must have reloaded 70 times. Here&#39;s how I finally did it:

The runner ups for most difficulty were:

2) Questionable Ethics ambush
3) Battle on the dam

Tell me what the hardest part was for you, and if possible, post a youtube video of you doing it. I want to see how you guys accomplished the hardest parts. It&#39;s not that hard to make a video. Here&#39;s a quick and dirty step by step for those who don&#39;t know how:

PREREQS-

1) Install VitualDub (google, get it from sourceforge)
2) Install x264vfw (google, sourceforge)
3) Install LAME MP3 ACM codec. MUST BE ACM, not the EXE. This is a bit of a pain if you&#39;re on any 64bit os. You MUST install it from the command prompt if you are. It&#39;s some rundll command. Just google &quot;LAME MP3 ACM x64&quot; The instructions are the same for XP, vista or 7, (as long as it&#39;s 64bit) just copy paste the command after you download it.

METHOD-

1) Activate the developer console under keyboard options in Black Mesa
2) Get to the hard part where you want to record.
3) Open the console (hot the ~ key) and type &quot;record BMdemo&quot;
4) Beat the part that you thought was hard with the demo recording
5) Type &quot;stop&quot; into the console when you&#39;re done. If you died and messed up, type &quot;stop&quot; anyway and reload your save and type in the same record command and try again.
6) With your successfully recorded demo, type &quot;host_framerate 30&quot; into the console.
7) Without leaving the console, type &quot;startmovie BMMovie&quot; into the console. This makes a ton of .tga files in the BMS directory. 2min movies can be upward of 15 gigabytes in size so make sure you have the HDD space.
8) Without leaving the console, type &quot;playdemo BMdemo&quot;
9) This takes a long time. It will run at like 2fps as it makes the demo movie.
10) Once done, type &quot;endmovie&quot; into the console.
11) Exit Black Mesa and load up VirtualDub.exe
12) File-&gt;Open video file and navigate to your steam directory, then steamapps, sourcemods, BMS and load up the first .tga file.
13) Under &quot;video&quot; in VirtualDub select &quot;Full Processing,&quot; Then select &quot;compression.&quot; Select x264vfw and hit configure. Under &quot;Rate control&quot; Select &quot;Single Pass - ratefactor based&quot; and move the slider to 24 or less. Hit &quot;Ok&quot; a few times.
14) Under &quot;audio&quot; in VirtualDub select &quot;Full Processing,&quot; Then &quot;Audio From Another File.&quot; In the same BMS directory select &quot;BMMovie.wav.&quot; Back under &quot;Audio&quot; in VirtualDub select &quot;compression,&quot; Then &quot;Lame MP3,&quot; Then &quot;44100Hz, 128kbps CBR, stereo.&quot; Hit &quot;Ok&quot;
15) In VirtualDub under &quot;File&quot; Hit &quot;Save As Avi...&quot; and let it render.
16) Upload to youtube.
17) Post it here.

If you&#39;re too lazy to make a video then just post were it was, but videos are much cooler. I want to see how you actually did it.</description>

            <p>No matter what, the QE ambush is the hardest part for me. I used every weapon and didn’t even use the healing &amp; charging stations before they appeared because I had full health &amp; armoour. The last thing I did was take down the two campers on the roof with the crossbow (8 health). I can’t believe I actually managed to stock up, find batteries and medkits enough to replenish all my health and armour before I headed out for more DEAD.</p>

            <aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway the hardest fight was the most annoying - that chopper at cliffs. Because to beat that fight you have to die as many times as it takes for you to figure out what to use as cover. And when that pile of rock is reached safe and game saved, there is still a lot work to do, especially when going after rocket ammo. I couldn`t reach that box once without getting hit.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I keep reading this … don’t know if the game glitched for me or what but the chopper was fairly easy. Hide behind the military crates toward the rear of the cave so you don’t get shot, pop up after its firing cycle and launch a rocket, drop back down, repeat. Also at some point it stopped firing at me at all, not sure why.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience with the tank later. If you just stand there in the open it will blow you up but if you hide behind something it just kind of cycles fire and you can time your counter-attacks in between. A few hits and it’s over. (This was on normal, and after I rather painstakingly eliminated all the HECU in the area.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the toughest and most irritating part for me was dying over and over from the stampers in Residue Processing. Followed by dying (sometimes over and over  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) from random long range and even around corners fire from marines in various places. At one point, during On A Rail I believe, I actually just stood there behind a wall and watched as debris flew from HECU gunfire way down the tracks and my health went steadily down. I couldn’t even see the marines.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Its funny that alot of people consider this section hard.  During my first playthrough i was able to navigate through this section without saving…and before the music even stopped playing.</p>
<p>It really is not difficult, just learn to crouch jump effectively.</p>
<p>IMO, the hardest thing about BM is HECU’s reaction time and accuracy.</p>

            <p>The section where around 2 HECUs and a tank attack you at once (shortly after leaving the cliffside through a pipe). Mainly because you can’t approach them from flank, you have to enter the scene from the underground. I just crouch-camped in the house-like thing so tank explosions didn’t hurt me and I just killed all HECUs who approached and then stand-fire rocket-crouch etc. to kill the tank.</p>

            <p>The osprey bit for me. I didn’t find it ridiculously difficult since I start it with 100/100 but the fact I end it with 0/50 or less makes it one hell of a battle. Basically since the soldiers never stop coming it is best to just rush out there and destroy the osprey with the RL or Tau cannon as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It seems to make a lot more sense to make the osprey carry a limited number of soldiers, like 3-4 groups of 4, because no osprey has the room for infinite number of them. Of course realism doesn’t always carry good gameplay with it, but in this case I think it will.</p>

            <p>Questionable Ethics fight was hard, however because I couldn<code>t figure out what to take as cover at first, but it turned out I had just to stay put where I came from and sniping soldiers one by one wasn</code>t a problem from there.</p>
<p>The only reason for tripmine part to be hard is source movement, but I found this part easier than in original, because it didn`t have guard and headcrabs. Anyway it was interesting lurking around there, taking it easy by exploring gaps in tripmine formations…</p>
<p>Surface Tension infinite soldier part is just ridiculous, because to pass this part I just had to perform kamikaze style rush by leaving grunt to fight against soldiers while not beign hindered at shooting down that flying thing, despite soldiers were just in front of me.</p>
<p>Anyway the hardest fight was the most annoying - that chopper at cliffs. Because to beat that fight you have to die as many times as it takes for you to figure out what to use as cover. And when that pile of rock is reached safe and game saved, there is still a lot work to do, especially when going after rocket ammo. I couldn<code>t reach that box once without getting hit. Eventually as chopper was almost beaten, its attack pattern felt like increase in speed so gaps in defense weren</code>t enough to even reach rocket ammo box, so I retreated in backroom where I had carried  rocket ammo prepared before fight. Luckily it was enough and chopper went down only after taking mere 25 rockets, on hard.</p>

It played well on my fears, and a lot of other peoples as well, I’m sure of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here’s a quick and dirty step by step for those who don’t know how:</p>
<p>PREREQS-</p>
<ol>
<li>Install VitualDub (google, get it from sourceforge)</li>
<li>Install x264vfw (google, sourceforge)</li>
<li>Install LAME MP3 ACM codec. MUST BE ACM, not the EXE. This is a bit of a pain if you’re on any 64bit os. You MUST install it from the command prompt if you are. It’s some rundll command. Just google “LAME MP3 ACM x64” The instructions are the same for XP, vista or 7, (as long as it’s 64bit) just copy paste the command after you download it.</li>
</ol>
<p>METHOD-</p>
<ol>
<li>Activate the developer console under keyboard options in Black Mesa</li>
<li>Get to the hard part where you want to record.</li>
<li>Open the console (hot the ~ key) and type “record BMdemo”</li>
<li>Beat the part that you thought was hard with the demo recording</li>
<li>Type “stop” into the console when you’re done. If you died and messed up, type “stop” anyway and reload your save and type in the same record command and try again.</li>
<li>With your successfully recorded demo, type “host_framerate 30” into the console.</li>
<li>Without leaving the console, type “startmovie BMMovie” into the console. This makes a ton of .tga files in the BMS directory. 2min movies can be upward of 15 gigabytes in size so make sure you have the HDD space.</li>
<li>Without leaving the console, type “playdemo BMdemo”</li>
<li>This takes a long time. It will run at like 2fps as it makes the demo movie.</li>
<li>Once done, type “endmovie” into the console.</li>
<li>Exit Black Mesa and load up VirtualDub.exe</li>
<li>File-&gt;Open video file and navigate to your steam directory, then steamapps, sourcemods, BMS and load up the first .tga file.</li>
<li>Under “video” in VirtualDub select “Full Processing,” Then select “compression.” Select x264vfw and hit configure. Under “Rate control” Select “Single Pass - ratefactor based” and move the slider to 24 or less. Hit “Ok” a few times.</li>
<li>Under “audio” in VirtualDub select “Full Processing,” Then “Audio From Another File.” In the same BMS directory select “BMMovie.wav.” Back under “Audio” in VirtualDub select “compression,” Then “Lame MP3,” Then “44100Hz, 128kbps CBR, stereo.” Hit “Ok”</li>
<li>In VirtualDub under “File” Hit “Save As Avi…” and let it render.</li>
<li>Upload to youtube.</li>
<li>Post it here.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re too lazy to make a video then just post were it was, but videos are much cooler. I want to see how you actually did it.</p>

<p>Use FRAPS, its much easier than your method.<br>

            <p>I would have to go with last fight (portal) where, above all, my game started lagging after I was killed several times regardless of video settings.</p>
<p>Also hardest part would be the tripwire part (it took me about 30 minutes to get through that). Questionable ethics ambush took me some time but not that long, I made it on 5th time.</p>

            <p>In my Let’s Play, that I was doing on Hard, I had a significant amount of trouble with the Questionable Ethics Lobby Ambush/Shootout. Here you can see my struggles and without looking online for tips I was able to overcome it but man. It was hard.</p>
<p>The 1st Part<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/S_WLi6iY_dg?t=10m40s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/S_WLi6iY_dg?t=10m40s</a></p>
<p>The 2nd Part<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/Wx6WTOSh3xw" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/Wx6WTOSh3xw</a></p>
<p>That was, by far, the hardest point of the game for me. I had a few minutes of getting killed a bunch of times at the same point but not a full episode worth. It was bad.</p>
