    <title>Can&#39;t Start Game Could Not Load Library Client</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-start-game-could-not-load-library-client/9637</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried everything for the last half hour to get this work.  I&#39;ve copied bin files in all the directories, restarted steam, reinstalling it.  Nothing will work.  Whatever I do I get the error, &quot;Could not load library client&quot; when it starts.  Game is installed in sourcemods, shows up in steam just fine.  Source SDK is installed as well as half-life 2.

Anyone know how to actually fix it?</description>
