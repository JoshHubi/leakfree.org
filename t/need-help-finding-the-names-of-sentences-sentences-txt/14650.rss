    <title>Need help finding the names of sentences (sentences.txt?)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-help-finding-the-names-of-sentences-sentences-txt/14650</link>
    <description>I managed to open the voiceover .vpk files and found the .wav&#39;s of all of the lines from the game, but none of the ones listed work in the Black Mesa hammer editor with the names they are listed as.
Is there some sort of sentences.txt file that I&#39;m not finding?</description>

            <p>So I know how to find the right names, but in the context of hitting the use key on a scientist it still isn’t working.<br>
Is it not possible to enter a .vcd file in the scientist’s use sentence field?</p>
<p>UPDATE 2: Keeping the scientist quiet and having the choreographed scene trigger on activating the scientist using outputs seems to do the trick.<br>
I’m learning!</p>

            <p>Try feeding it the appropriate .vcd in the scenes folder. You can use Faceposer to open them and see which is which.</p>

<p>What are you trying to use them as? They should be choreography, so a logic_choregraphed_scene. They likely won’t have the same title as the .wav files.</p>

</aside>
<p>Right now I’m putting them in the “Use Sentence” field on a scientist as a way to test them out.<br>
How would I go about figuring out what the usable titles are?</p>
<p>UPDATE: added a logic_choreographed_scene and it turns out they’re all listed in the entity!<br>
I’ll lock this in the morning unless you have any other tips or tricks to offer.</p>
