    <title>Game Crash - On A Rail</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crash-on-a-rail/14040</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

Firstly, great work on the game. Its excellent and I am really enjoying playing through single player. Up until the point I mention below the game runs virtually flawlessly for me. There are a few issues (stuck Vortigaunts etc.) but nothing major.

After launching the satellite missile during &quot;on a rail&quot; I get on to the yellow freight transport and start to move forward. As soon as the &quot;Loading&quot; screen appears the game exits and spits me back to the desktop meaning that I am unable to progress any further. I have tried to move forward through the tunnel both on the freight transport and by walking, as soon as the loading screen appears the game crashes (exits without warning). I have attached the dump file created which will hopefully help you guys track down the issue (had to zip it as the forum up-loader moaned about the .dmp extension)


The following might be helpful?

* This happens every time consistently
* It&#39;s the most recent steam version (as of 14.05.15)
* PC specs are - AMD Phenom 2 X6 1055T processor 2.80Ghz, 8GB RAM, AMD 7970 GPU, Windows 7 64-bit
* 
* 
Apologies if this has been posted before but I have done a search and didn&#39;t see it. As far as bugs go its a show-stopper.


Thanks,
Mrrnoname
