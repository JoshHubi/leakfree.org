    <title>The Atomic MPC quote on the front page</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-atomic-mpc-quote-on-the-front-page/6914</link>
    <description>Hello though this is my first time posting, I have been following Black Mesa Source for two years. I do reviews of [url=&#39;https://imbacore.blogspot.com/search/label/Free%20FPS&#39;]freeware games[/url] as a hobby so your project interests me immensely. 

I would like to point out though that the Atomic MPC quote on the front page (&quot;one massive, jawdropping session&quot;) is quite misleading. IMHO, I don&#39;t think that the Atomic MPC writer was referring to your project; he was referring to the original Half-Life as evidenced by the sentence that preceded the quote in question:
[quote]
It&#39;s one of those things that many people can remember perfectly, including what they were doing when they first played, where they were - we were writing a preview for PC Authority when we received the first 20 per cent of the finished game from then unknown developer Valve.
[/quote]
After this he writes:
[quote]
And we finished it one massive, jawdropping session.
[/quote]
I hope this won&#39;t be misconstrued as an attack, just a concerned community member giving his two cents. 


Just in case you&#39;re curious here are my Black Mesa: Source articles:

Wishing you all the best in finishing the mod. (If memory serves there&#39;s a Deus Ex project that took 7 years to finish so the delay is understandable.)</description>
