    <title>Game won&#39;t start after I replaced monitor</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-wont-start-after-i-replaced-monitor/12759</link>
    <description>Help! I&#39;ve waited forever to get a computer I could play this mod on, finally got one and played the game through once. I wanted to start a new game...

But I recently changed my monitor from an old 15 inch CRT to a much larger plasma screen. Now Black Mesa Source won&#39;t start! It just briefly flashes black on my screen and crashes to the desktop.

I&#39;ve actually had a similar problem with most of my games since the change, but have been able to fix most of them by either going into an INI file and changing resolution to windowed mode, starting the game and then fixing the settings. Most of my HL2 mods I fixed this way, by putting a [b]-windowed[/b] param in the launch options. But trying that option with BMS didn&#39;t work. Is there an INI file somewhere I can edit to force it to open in a windowed 1024x768 mode?

I also tried simply deleting and reinstalling the game; this didn&#39;t help a bit.

My system: Windows 7 64 bit Home Edition, AMD Radeon HD 6670 video card.</description>

<p>in steam under Black Mesa’s properties, there is a button called launch options, there you can add the following:</p>
