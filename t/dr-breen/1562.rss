<p>I know he isn’t doing it himself, but according to some of the stuff he says he appears to be spending a lot of his time persuading them that humans can be useful, and Gordon etc.'s actions have made this much more difficult. Of course, it’s open to interpretation.</p>

<p>it might be worth mentioning that according to RTB, valve intended Breen to have contacted the Combine prior to the RC. however, the revelation about the Gman in ep2 seems to contradict this (or just makes it more convoluted).</p>

</aside>
<p>I actually found Breen’s broadcasts to be quite amusing. While, technically speaking, it’s a bunch of bullshit, what he says DOES have some validity. It’s just the circumstances under which he is broadcasting that makes them annoying sometimes.</p>

“Good job! Marc Laidlaw pointed this out to me as being pretty darn accurate for the most part.”<br>
This states that the overall summary is pretty accurate, but not necessarily every detail.</p>
<p>What’s most likely is that Dr. Breen’s actual motivations are intentionally left open to interpretation so that there is room to mold things to fit whatever Valve needs for any type of plot device they might come up with in the future. As a result, your interpretation may be just as good as mine, but I feel that the methodology to his arguments reek of far too much propaganda for him to honestly believe in what he’s doing.<br>
The types of arguments he makes when trying to convince the rebels, the combine soldiers, Eli, and even Gordon and Mossman all are highly emotional arguments that that twist facts and are specifically crafted with the intent to provoke a visceral rather than logical reaction in the person he is speaking to. My experience is that these are not traits of someone who honestly believes in the points they represent, or if they do, it is because they are deluding themselves even more than they are anyone else.</p>
<p>It’s actually the primary reason I love him as a villian. Underneath all the twofaced smiles and impotent displays of anger, he’s a sniveling, ass-kissing bureaucrat. It makes for such a realistic villian in what is otherwise a fantastical universe and it not only makes it so easy to hate him, but it also grounds the fantastic aspects of HalfLife and makes them all the easier to believe.</p>

<p>Now that you mention it, I actually have had no clue who wrote that timeline. I need to read more carefully. So thanks for telling me.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>However, now that I think about it, his arguments <span class="bbcode-b">are</span> very emotional. I actually started a new game and stood in the train station listening to his broadcasts. And a lot of the stuff he said makes perfect sense, especially the part about human nature and instinct. If it wasn’t for the oh so obvious fact that the Combine don’t give a shit about the advancement of humanity, I would actually have believed him in a real life conversation. What a manipulative little bastard!</p>
<p>On another less serious note, how would you feel/what would you do if you had an opportunity to face Dr. Breen? Personally, I’d shoot him in the face(or smash him with a crowbar).</p>

<p>You don’t really understand  politics too well, do you? 90% of the crap he spouted were excuses designed to justify what he did. He didn’t actually believe that humanity would benefit from the combine. When he surrendered, it was for 2 reasons;</p>

<li>Ultimately though, Breen is the type of person that believed that by allowing himself to be used as a puppet by the combine, he could sacrifice the rest of humanity in order to garner personal favor. In the meantime he gets to act as the ruler of humanity, even if it is only as a puppet. It’s possible that it even worked to a certain extent given the spiel he was telling Eli at the end of HL2. It’s pretty obvious that would only last as long as he showed the ability to be useful, and once humanity’s resources were expended, his usefulness would be gone as well and he would be discarded without a second thought.<br>
People who play politics do so because it gives them an advantage they’d never have on their own skills, and for some reason they never consider the other side may simply stop playing, possibly because they know they have absolutely no chance once that happens.</li>

<p>I admit I <span class="bbcode-b">don’t</span> know much about politics, but what I stated before was based on what I read from the Half-life Saga website. The excerpts that I based my statement on are listed below.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Wallace Breen, “made” optimistic about the Combine takeover, is appointed the Administrator of Earth, acting as a puppet for the Combine. How he is selected for this role is unknown at this time. Breen’s first act is to surrender Earth to the Combine, explaining that the Combine have arrived for good, to immortalize humanity, convinced by the Combine that the loss of life is inevitable in this transition period as Earth joins the Universal Union…Breen’s message is simple: That humanity should not attempt in any way to cause friction in the transition period as mankind integrates itself with the Combine. He believes in order to join this Universal Union, Man will have to sacrifice a lot, but he still believes that the ends justify the means. He truly believes that joining the Combine will be positive to humanity, and tries to convert the rest of it to his point of view.</span></p>
<p>If I misinterpreted these excerpts of what appears to be Breen’s personal feelings towards the Combine’s rule, please let me know where I made a mistake.

<p>You don’t really understand  politics too well, do you? 90% of the crap he spouted were excuses designed to justify what he did. He didn’t actually believe that humanity would benefit from the combine. When he surrendered, it was for 2 reasons;</p>

<p>Then again, if he does come back, I might have a chance to kill him. Face to face. With a gun. Much better than seeing him fall down the teleport chamber in HL2.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure on Breen returning cause we all expect it. But I suppose it’ll be based on how Valve implements it, in other games such as MW2, where a iconic character makes a return, it was completely unexpected. So I guess its just a case of hoping for the best. Breen was quite a compelling antagonist in the HL-series if I say so myself.</p>
