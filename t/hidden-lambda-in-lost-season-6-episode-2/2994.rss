    <title>Hidden Lambda in Lost Season 6 Episode 2?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hidden-lambda-in-lost-season-6-episode-2/2994</link>
    <description>Ok, so I&#39;m pretty sure we all know of the Lost easter egg in Half Life 2: Episode Two.  It&#39;s the one with the number sequence: &quot;4 8 15 16 23 42&quot;, along with the Dharma Initiative (you can look it up if you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about).

Anyway, I believe I have found an easter egg in Lost Season 6 episode 2.  It occurs approximately 17:58 minutes into the episode.  It is when Jack is walking in the testing room to find out what is going on with Sayid.  Here&#39;s a picture of it:

So, what do you guys think?  It could after all, just be a coincidence, but I though it was pretty neat.</description>

<p>There is indeed a lost video game.  I got it from a friend just to see how horrible it was.  Got to like… sequence three, right after those tardholes got back from recovering the radio from the pilot’s chamber of the plane.</p>
