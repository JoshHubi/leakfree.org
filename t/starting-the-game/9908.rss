    <description>This is probably the stupidest question of all time but where is the actual launch application... The only application i can find is the setup application and it just tries to reinstall the game. I honest to god cannot find the launch/run application. Yes it&#39;s installed as BMS in steamapps and yes ive downloaded the source 2007 thingy.</description>
