What the hell is this shit? How much did Activison pay them under the damn table for this shit to happen, what has the video game industry become where we can&#39;t have a truthful and honest &#39;X&#39; game of the year award? Any of the other nominees were better than that crap. Heck, Skyrim&#39;s bow and arrow action is more of a entertaining shooter than that crap.

Also, Uncharted 3 looks good, but not &#39;that&#39; good.

In my opinion it seems like the whole VGA was crap except for a few awards. I agree with the Game of The Year, and a few other areas, but others were like WTF? Seriously, what low-down idiots review this stuff and give the awards?</description>

            <p>VGA’s are the dumbest shit ever. They are just as bad as mainstream review sites, if not worse.</p>
<p>Last time I watched the VGAs was when they awarded Halo 2 best single player campaign over half-life 2. I can see they haven’t changed much.</p>

            <p>Spike TV does that every year in December.  I don’t even bother to watch it.  The one that really matters is E3.</p>

            <p>What was it, the first year, where Samuel L. Jackson was going on about the PS4, and he was all “and it will have a vagina.”</p>
<p>Yeah.  If anyone else had said it, the joke would have been even worse.</p>
