    <title>[YOUTUBE] Who is Gman</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/youtube-who-is-gman/740</link>
    <description>I started making this about a month ago and never finished it. It involves the identity of Gman and one of my theories on the matter. 

Again, it is currently unfinished.

<p>That’s not how you do a conspiracy video!<br>
Your video needs to have clips of Nazi Marches with speeches by President Bush talking about 9/11, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKLpJtvzlEI" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKLpJtvzlEI</a> playing loudly in the background for dramatic effect.

            <p>The Gman mystery is a fantastic and entertaining topic. In no other video game today is there a character that has such a huge factor in a storyline yet we know next to nothing about him. There can be a million different possibilities as to who or what he is.</p>
<p>To me, it’s like the UFO phenomenon. Nobody knows the truth for sure, but why not speculate about it? I accept the fact that we may never know his true intention, and I have to say that is far more entertaining than actually figuring it out.</p>
<p>I respect everybody’s own opinion, except the one about Gordon being Gman obviously because it is in fact ridiculous and sloppy storytelling. I’d never shoot down anybody for what they think about it. Lastly, it’s a little thick-minded if you don’t understand what I’m saying about Gman in terms of him being a god.</p>
<p>PS. Which facts are not straight?</p>

            <p>You can’t paint a picture until the canvas is set.</p>
<p>Your conjecture is no less pathetic than anybody elses conjecture. It’s a harsh truth but one everyone who has made a video like this needs to face.</p>
<p>If only someone would actually approach it without bias with <span class="bbcode-i">all their facts straight</span> and actually look at the whole picture rather than trying to make the events fit their theory and disregard anything to the contrary.</p>
<p>You say you believe him to be God but “not THE God”. Make up your mind. I think you mean to say he’s Godlike. I think you could have put more thought into this…</p>
