    <title>Windows Vista/7 OEM on another PC?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-vista-7-oem-on-another-pc/2665</link>
    <description>Ever since Windows XP I&#39;ve bought OEM, I bought Vista Ultimate OEM and recently I bought Windows 7 Professionaly OEM.

Now, since I&#39;m using Win7 on my PC and my parents&#39; laptop is in for repairs, I was planning on doing a clean install of my OEM copy of Vista on their laptop, when they get it back.

Can I do this, I know that there&#39;s no difference on a technical level between the retail and OEM versions, and I don&#39;t care for the legal mumbo jumbo between those versions. But since I&#39;ve already had Vista installed and activated on my PC before, can I still activate it on my parents&#39; laptop?

I&#39;ve read that there are some restrictions with reinstalling/activating OEM Windows on a different PC, is this true or can I just go ahead and install it on their laptop?</description>

<p>Well, I kinda thought that would be a given, otherwise I wouldn’t be telling you to go for it.</p>

<p>What about free(as in beer and speech) Operating Systems?</p>
<p>OEM means Original Equipment Manufacturer, or System Builder. Specifically, in the case of Windows, System Builder Software. Windows Vista OEM is tied to the motherboard and after a certain amount of core components are changed it asks for a new license.<br>
You <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> be able to install and activate it on the laptop if you call MS for a re-activation. I know one or two people who tried it, they all got a Microsoft Representative and had to make up some crap about their computer/motherboard dying.</p>

            <p>No, it has nothing to with the manufacturer. OEM means that it’s the same as retail (but cheaper) with the exception that you have to chose between 32bit and 64bit (retail has both), and you can’t reinstall on another PC.</p>
<p>“Another PC” is defined by the mainboard, so you can upgrade your computer without trouble as long as you don’t change the MOBO.</p>
<p>But even so, it should be possible to install it on another PC, you apparently have to call Microsoft and say your MOBO died and you’ve changed it.</p>
<p>Still, anyone else who has tried this?</p>

            <p>Not sure quite how OEM operating systems work, but i do remember trying to install an HP copy of XP on a Sony and it didn’t work.</p>
<p>At the same time though i can install a Dell copy of XP on another Dell no problem.</p>
<p>So i believe the main question is, are the 2 computers by the same manufacture.</p>
<p>Also don’t torrent operating systems, that’s just asking for trouble.</p>

            <p>Yes, but I already have a legitimate version so why would I download a cracked version?</p>
<p>All I want to know is if I can reinstall/activate my OEM Vista on another mainboard. I’ve had it installed and activated on my own PC before and now I want to install it on my parents’ laptop, I need to be certain that it’ll work.</p>

            <p>Strange… Once I bought an OS (directly off of Microsoft), and then e-mailed them saying I’d like to put it on my laptop, and they gave me FOUR extra keys.  It was a bit of a WTF moment, but I then proceeded to give those extra three keys out to my room-mate and family.</p>
<p>The OS was 7 Ultimate x64.</p>
<p>Maybe the sales rep I got or customer service guy was just dedicated to ruining Microsoft, one person at a time, or something…</p>

            <p>So you’ve actually installed/activated Vista OEM on one PC, and then on another PC, and all you had to do was call Microsoft?</p>
<p>Did you have to speak to a real person or is it like activating XP over the phone in that you simply have to enter the activation key and they give you a confirmation key?</p>

            <p>You should be fine. At most, you’d have to call an automated phone service to verify and activate the license. Takes less than 5 minutes.</p>

            <p>Ever since Windows XP I’ve bought OEM, I bought Vista Ultimate OEM and recently I bought Windows 7 Professionaly OEM.</p>
<p>Now, since I’m using Win7 on my PC and my parents’ laptop is in for repairs, I was planning on doing a clean install of my OEM copy of Vista on their laptop, when they get it back.</p>
<p>Can I do this, I know that there’s no difference on a technical level between the retail and OEM versions, and I don’t care for the legal mumbo jumbo between those versions. But since I’ve already had Vista installed and activated on my PC before, can I still activate it on my parents’ laptop?</p>
<p>I’ve read that there are some restrictions with reinstalling/activating OEM Windows on a different PC, is this true or can I just go ahead and install it on their laptop?</p>
