    <title>Recommend me a sound card</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/recommend-me-a-sound-card/8431</link>
    <description>I&#39;m planning a new build here soon and would like to get a dedicated sound card for it, but I don&#39;t really need the best, just something better than onboard. I&#39;ve heard every opinion imaginable on every card I&#39;ve considered, so I&#39;m just going to narrow it down to the two cheapest: the Asus Xonar DX and the HT Omega Striker. I&#39;m going to be using it for music and gaming with analog headphones. It seems like the Striker is a bit better for music, and the DX is a bit better for games, but since I&#39;m gonna be doing both, I&#39;m not sure which is the better choice. Is there any compelling reason to choose one over the other?</description>

            <p>I’d have liked a card that supported EAX just to get a bit more from my older games, but idk if it’s worth it. The Xonar looks good though, I forgot about it. I should check it out.</p>

<p>EAX has nothing to do with 3D sound - EAX = Environmental Audio Extensions, it’s a technology which allows sound hardware to more accurately recreate certain environmental ambiance, via signal processing and support for multiple voices at once (i.e. having a character talking, birds chirping, wind blowing, etc, all simultaneously - not all hardware can support many distinct sound sources at once).  EAX isn’t as important as it used to be, since game designers have started coding their own sound processing engines that bypass what EAX can do, but it has its place.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, I had heard that EAX was becoming less and less relevant as time goes on so I didn’t worry about the sound card supporting it or not.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Batz. Good to get the opinion of someone who owns the product. Like I said, I’m not a huge audiophile, but I do like to have a certain level of audio quality, and I know sound cards have improved my experience in the past. However, this is a new onboard chip I haven’t tried before. If the ALC892 that my board comes with sounds pretty good, I’ll be happy. If I find it’s lacking, I’ll definitely pick up the Xonar DX.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just like it’s not really necessary to use anything besides onboard video…but don’t expect to play any game more complex than Solitaire with it.  For someone who wants quality sound for both gaming and music, onboard shouldn’t be a consideration.</p>

</aside>
<p>You’re talking maybe 1-2% CPU utilization if you’re using 100% of the soundcard, so its extremely negligible.  See below about the Xonar.</p>

</aside>
<p>I have the Asus P6X58D-E motherboard which has a Realtek ALC889 on it, and I also have the [COLOR=‘DeepSkyBlue’]Asus Xonar DX.  I assure you, there is an extraordinary difference for both music and games between the two boards.  I highly recommend the <a href="https://brainbit.wordpress.com/category/uni-xonar/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Uni</a>drivers if you get the Xonar - really improves the options and from what I understand, fixes some processing issues that affect certain games (that is, it’s a Windows problem but the modified drivers workaround it, etc).</p>
<p>Considering I got the Xonar over a year ago, and it was $60 after MIR, and it’s around $70 from what I see now, I’d say to get it.  Just as an experiment, I switch to the Realtek for about a month, then back to the Xonar and my ears were like, “Why did you torture us for a month?!”</p>

            <p>I’m not really all that qualified to say which cards are better than others but I bought <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16829271003" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> card just a bit ago and it’s really good as far as I can tell.
