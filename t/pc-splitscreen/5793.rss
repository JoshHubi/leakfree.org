    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pc-splitscreen/5793</link>
    <description>Why don&#39;t we have it? One of the biggest advantages xbox has over pc gaming is splitscreen. It makes social gaming far easier and more fun. So why doesn&#39;t computer have splitscreen gaming??? First player would use mouse keyboard or controller, and then any other players would use a controller. L4D1 even has code for splitscreen in it: [url=&#39;https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=745113&#39;]L4D1 splitscreen[/url]. So what I&#39;m wondering is, if it&#39;s clearly possible and a huge advantage, why don&#39;t developers do it???</description>

<p>Well I think the issue is that there’s not really an easy way for you to do it. What, pray tell, would you use to play with? Your controllers? As was stated, you might as well go use a console, and play a game that does split screen well, like Halo or Killzone or something. If you want to use a second keyboard/mouse, good luck.</p>

            <p>I’ve read up so i know the deal, but hell, my 42" in my bedroom, for single player, i considered getting a bigger size because that’s maybe getting a little to small for me, like fuck am i sharing that screen  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>but as for gaming on my pc, my 24" is fine as im very close it it at a desk.</p>
<p>Splitscreen doesn’t bode well for pc’s, a very large room, with matching desk’s and nice furniture in a 2x2 back to back setup works well, and they have a screen each, this as well all know is called LAN. LAN is in a sense the PC’s version of multiplayer/vs splitscreen. but the actual word SPLITSCREEN is still non existant, so, why would you want it?</p>
<p>You wanna play multiplayer with your friends on PC, buy another pc.</p>
<p>PC isnt excatly budget gaming, fucking deal with it, console is.</p>

            <p>I have used an LCD TV as a computer monitor before. I just can’t see it being practical unless you had a wireless mouse and keyboard (in which case, you may as well just use a wireless controller and a console). Of course, I understand that using a 32 inch or something that size is perfectly normal as a computer monitor, but say a 52 inch is a little more difficult to justify and to put into practice as a monitor. As for having your computer hooked up to your TV in your living room, are they all hooked up at once? Is that where you keep your PC full time? If not, there’s no way in hell you’d catch me hauling my computer back and forth to the living room to do something that a console already there can do.</p>
<p>Ironically enough, I have started hooking up my 360 to my 1080p computer monitor instead.</p>

            <p>I’d just like to throw this out there, OP has mentioned several times that the secondary players or even all the players would use a controller to facilitate splitscreen on the PC. In my opinion, if you were going to use controllers anyway, you may as well just sit down in front of a TV with some friends and use a console. You’d end up with the same experience, and honestly, I’d rather be doing it with a 52" TV as a opposed to a computer monitor.</p>
<p>If the next argument is to perhaps move your computer to the living room and hook it up to the TV to play multiplayer games, I’d say that’s essentially what a CONSOLE DOES.</p>

            <p>Garth, you’re alone in a crusade no one believes in.</p>
<p>I understand your points, but the thing is, if it was something a lot of PC gamers wanted for a long time, then it would’ve been supported already at some point by the mainstream industry.</p>
<p>The L4D splitscreen feature on PC is just a leftover code from the 360 that Valve overlooked. If it was intentional or not, I don’t know, but still, it’s not officially supported by them and only a fan made mod makes it work properly.</p>
<p>There simply is not enough demand for splitscreen on PC gaming for the several reasons that were already mentioned here and you’re not certainly going to change anything. Specially if you keep referring to console gamers as fags.</p>

<p>Holy shit what a load of utter rubbish.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m always impressed with the way you handle criticism of your ideas. You asked a question as to why developers don’t do it currently, I and others have given you the answer.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="garthbartin">

<p>The biggest argument for pc splitscreen is it would probably take little work on the part of developers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Right, and so when every hour spent making a game costs money, why would they spend it when the entire community has adapted to playing games in a particular way. Motion controls are an evolution from standard controllers; that’s why they’re able to catch on. Split screen is a total U-turn in standard computer gaming, which is why it feels absurd and unnatural.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="garthbartin">

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, it might be more difficult to play, but co-op would be so much more fun if the person were standing right next to you (yes I know you could LAN but that is an incredible hassle).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So, basically, it would be harder than normal, but LAN is more of a hassle? So configuring a second controller is easy then? I read the instructions and it sure as hell doesn’t seem that easy. Would buying and setting up a second set of keyboards/mouses be better?</p>
<p>I’d say the hassle of pulling out an ethernet cord or telling someone your wireless password is nothing compared to the hassle of trying to set up split screen. Moreover, the enjoyability of a game only decreases with split screen; even on a laptop, games are going to be more fun, because you’re playing them <span class="bbcode-i">the way they’re supposed to be played</span>.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="garthbartin">

<p>Also, it doesn’t take a sofa to splitscreen game. All it would take is two people two chairs and a decent sized monitor; 24 inches would be more than enough.  I’ve splitscreen gamed on consoles with about a 13 inch tv. And possibly it could even be set up so that people with two monitors could have one player on each monitor, or two players on each monitor.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Firstly, I never said you needed a sofa, and even if you had one, that wouldn’t fix the problem. Secondly, having a monitor each <span class="bbcode-i">would</span> solve the issue of, you know, an inability to see, but wouldn’t fix any of the other issues, namely that you’d need a second set of peripherals that would serve no other useful function but for the few games you could play with them. Thirdly, do you know if that’s even possible? Fourthly, if you’ve really splitscreened games on a 13 inch TV, you’d know how unbelievably painful it is, especially when, on a console, you don’t sit with your face pressed up next to it.</p>

<p>Ummmm… you do realize RTS’s are actually a very small minority of video games, pc or not? RTS’s aren’t even close to “most pc games”. Just because you’re an RTS fag doesn’t mean everyone else is.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh garth, your thinly veiled insults are always so entertaining. Aside from the fact that Starcraft is one of the most popular games in the world, I simply said that it wouldn’t work for a lot of games, <span class="bbcode-i">and that was why it wasn’t implemented in those games</span>. Sometimes you need to learn to read your own questions, and you’ll understand your answers a lot more.</p>

<p>Why not take the strong points of both and meld them together? It worked for the ps3 mouse controller.</p>

</aside>
<p>…Right. Aside from the fact that <a href="https://www.mygamer.com/index.php?page=articles&amp;mode=viewarticles&amp;id=476" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">it doesn’t work</a>, the reason you shouldn’t do it is because console gaming has evolved to use the controller. Everything from racing to fighting has been grafted onto a controller interface, and transposing that to a keyboard and mouse doesn’t go naturally at all in most cases. That’s why Prince of Persia feels clunky on a PC, and FPS gaming feels silly on a console. And that’s exactly the same reason you shouldn’t have split screen gaming on a PC. For a gaming platform that has evolved in a particular way with a particular set of players, making this investment to please an extremely tiny minority will provide no return on investment, thus meaning that nobody does it.</p>
<p>If you’re so obsessed with the idea, learn to code and do it in every game you want to play, but we’ve told you why game developers don’t do it. In summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It doesn’t work for a whole bunch of game types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It isn’t congruent with how computer gaming works, meaning that it just wont work well for 99% of computer set-ups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer gamers won’t use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its what consoles are for.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p>2)Maybe, but making it “easier” doesn’t make it better. If I was going to a LAN party I’d rather have my own PC to myself and not lose half my screen real estate. Some people would do it, but they would be in the minority. It’s not like over night LAN parties would use half the number of PCs if split screen was included in every game.</p>
<p>3 &amp; 4) This would work for racing/fighting games, but for anything like an FPS or any type of shooter really, most people on PC prefer keyboard and mouse. The second player would have a gimped experience unless you had a large enough desk to fit two keyboard and two mice and the game was able to detect the two.</p>
<p>PC gamers are used to the best of the best and being able to mod and customise their games, so if devs suddenly turned around and announced split screen PC gaming with controllers I think most people would say “wtf” and “meh.”</p>

<li>
<p>For the whole LAN Party thing, most online games are designed for more than the standard 2-4 people in a splitscreen situation. LAN parties usually have more then 2-4 people, and small LAN parties will often have the players forming a team for a larger online experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can barely get developers to change the look of the main character between games (standard brown hair, brown eyes), and you expect them to start shifting focus of the gameplay to allowing splitscreening?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ah, but the diagram fails to take into account where the set-up is. I know my set-up is NOT in an area where a second chair would be easily thrown in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having 1 player sit near the screen with mouse and keyboard while others sat back and to the side with controllers would just feel… odd and out of place.</p>

<li>true, but I don’t think it’d be hard to implement so even if only a few people enjoyed it it’d take little work, and it might convince console fags to switch to pc And if LAN parties are pretty popular then clearly pc players like social gaming, so why not make social gaming way easier; two player per computer instead of one</li>
<li>I don’t see this as a reason things can’t change</li>
<li>true, but in diagram 2 you could very easily and comfortably set down another chair and play some 2 person co-op</li>
<li>as I’ve said before all secondary players would use controllers like in the L4D1 modification</li>

            <p>There are a number of different reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Majority of PC gamers don’t care about splitscreen gaming, so devs don’t include it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PCs have always normally been a single user experience, so by extension so has the gaming. Consoles on the other hand have almost always been splitscreen experiences because when console gaming began there weren’t networks for console gaming so the only way to experience multiplayer was to have multiple people on the one system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The environments for console make it a lot easier to do splitscreen as most of them are set up in large open rooms in front of a couch</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Compared to most PC setups that are very close and designed for single user use with a computer chair</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a1f032fb12cf27dded9c4bfe0eb6f39363cfcf66.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="n6zuOB7eHWiwZKtp2nlJx6TFdt4" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>With the console gaming there is a lot more room for people to sit and play whereas with PC gaming there is usually less room.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>It’s a lot easier to grab 2-4 controllers and pass them around, especially these days with wireless, than to set up 2-4 keyboard and mice.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Three reasons I can think of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Its not a huge advantage for most PC games.</span> The way PC gaming has evolved and the way console gaming has evolved means that they fill two entirely different niches. The former has a particular set of gametypes centered around the idea of a single person sitting down at a single monitor with a single set of interface modules; adding an extra screen doesn’t in any way enhance most games. On the contrary, a second screen on an RTS would just detract from gameplay, because both of your friends have to deal with half the screen, making the game almost impossible to play. That means that, for most PC games, split screen would just be stupid.</li>
</ol>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Ummmm… you do realize RTS’s are actually a very small minority of video games, pc or not? RTS’s aren’t even close to “most pc games”. Just because you’re an RTS fag doesn’t mean everyone else is.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Its not a huge advantage even for games that it could work for.</span> Even when you consider games that <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> be played in split screen, its really not the way the PC has been set up to operate. Sure, you <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> do it, in the same way that you <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> plug a keyboard and a mouse into your 360 and play Halo like, you know, a normal FPS should be played. [COLOR=‘Red’]That would be a MASSIVE improvement. Proof; <a href="https://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=ps3+mouse+controller&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=ivs&amp;resnum=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;cid=3147666178784916261&amp;ei=ftjNTOuPFoqWsgP8yLmHDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_catalog_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEYQ8wIwAA&amp;os=reviews" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">PS3 mouse controller reviews.</a> But the point is that the two serve different functions and shouldn’t be unnaturally grafted onto each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]Why not take the strong points of both and meld them together? It worked for the ps3 mouse controller.</p>
<p>The PC has evolved as a single person (perhaps even masturbatory) gaming machine, whereas a console is a more social one, allowing multiple people to play on the same TV. Further, PCs are capable of doing numerous other tasks with their human interface devices, whereas consoles are only able to do one thing; play games. That means that, as devices, they have evolved to suit different purposes; people who buy consoles do it because they want to play games when their friends are sharing the same screen, and people who buy PCs want to play games when their friends aren’t sharing the pixels. That means that PC users will never take advantage of such a feature, just because if they wanted to do it, they already would have.</p>
<p>If multiplayer in-home gaming is your priority, then you invest in a console; if it isn’t, then you go for a PC. Sure, some people who buy PCs do it because they can’t afford both, but the group isn’t huge, and the amount of people who would take advantage of it for any kind of appreciable amount of time would make the time and effort it would take to implement it across a wide variety of games a poor investment choice.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]Just because console has always been social and pc has always been solitary is not even close to a legitimate reason why pc shouldn’t be more social. With splitscreen pc could easily be both social and solitary. Using splitscreen on a controller would not be as convenient as splitscreen on a console, but it’d be great for those who want to play with friends and don’t own a console, which is a lot more people than you think.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Its not really possible.</span> PCs are set up to have a single set of interface equipment; you <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> see a PC with two keyboards and mouses, just because its functionally useless for every single other task a computer uses. That makes the investment overtly onerous for a tiny return on your investment; you get the ability to play a few select games when one of your friends come round, yes, but how will that second keyboard help you browse the internet?</li>
</ol>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]Holy shit have you even read my posts?? I suggested a system in which secondary players or all players used controllers.</p>
<p>Further, as has already been mentioned, most monitors are tiny. Computers as small as laptops are designed to play games; how will a 13 inch laptop fare with two people trying to control two armies in Total War? The answer: Not well.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]Why do you seem to think RTS’s are the sole type of pc gaming??? There’s FPS’s out there, try them. You list all these minorities that wouldn’t work for splitscreen and then tell me that that rules out the vast majority of pc gaming. Also, you do realize laptop gaming is a VERY small portion of gaming? If someone can game on their 13 inch laptop screen then clearly two people could share my 24 inch screen. This looks easily playable to me and it’s a much lower res than my monitor (screenshot of L4D1 pc splitscreen):<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The biggest argument for pc splitscreen is it would probably take little work on the part of developers. L4D1 already had splitscreen code made by valve in it, and all it takes to make it work is a small modification (see link in OP).  Just imagine if Portal 2 shipped with splitscreen on pc. Sure, it might be more difficult to play, but co-op would be so much more fun if the person were standing right next to you (yes I know you could LAN but that is an incredible hassle). And especially for Valve; seeing as all their games use the source engine, they probably would only have to code splitscreen once and it would work for all their games and all mods (with a few modifications for each of course).</p>
<p>Also, it doesn’t take a sofa to splitscreen game. All it would take is two people two chairs and a decent sized monitor; 24 inches would be more than enough.  I’ve splitscreen gamed on consoles with about a 13 inch tv. And possibly it could even be set up so that people with two monitors could have one player on each monitor, or two players on each monitor.</p>
<p>In summary; pc splitscreen wouldn’t appeal to a whole lot of people, but it would take a very small amount of work to implement and would be incredibly nice for the people it appealed to. Whenever I talk to a console user they always tell me abotu how important splitscreen is, so clearly it matters to gamers. And if pc were given splitscreen gamers who were trying to decide between pc or xbox would go pc.</p>
