    <description>I am looking into getting a gaming laptop and I found the MSI GX740-434 and I thought that it was the best deal. The problem is I cant seem to find any website that has it in stock. It isnt even in stock at Amazon. Do they not make it anymore? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>…why would anyone suggest Alienware?</p>
<p>I’ve had an HP Pavilion laptop for six years now.  The gaming power was a bit middling out of the box, but that was a function of my budget at the time rather than anything wrong with the laptop itself.  The lappy has at times frustrated the hell out of me, but, six years later, it’s still going strong (except for the battery, which completely died a month or two ago).  I just played ME2 on it last week (in a window at 800x600… good show, that m̶a̶n̶ laptop).  I don’t know what HP’s laptops are like lately, but based on my experience, I’d recommend it.</p>

            <p>Thanks Imonfire but I wasn’t able to find what I was looking for. Do you have any suggestions for a gaming laptop? (besides Alienware)</p>
