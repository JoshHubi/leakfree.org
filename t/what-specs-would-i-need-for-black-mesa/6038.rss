    <title>What specs would I need for Black Mesa?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-specs-would-i-need-for-black-mesa/6038</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m asking something I shouldn&#39;t but what are the maximum specifications I&#39;d need for Black Mesa when it is released? Would I need Unreal Development Kit compatible hardware or hardware that is HL2: Episode 2 compatible?</description>

CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E4500 Overclocked to 3.98Ghz.<br>

            <p>Don’t be to hard on someone just because they didn’t look for their question before posting, before posting a new thread it should really alert you to look in the FAQ that way we’d get less accidental posts like this and people could stop saying “READ THE FAQ” all the time.</p>

<p>I find it funny that the older members are really helpful to this guy and you, who have only been here a little complains about it.  This is especially funny since there haven’t been hardly any of these bscy read the faq threads in a while.</p>
<p>Do your self a favor and hope off the bandwagon along with the rest of the forum.</p>
