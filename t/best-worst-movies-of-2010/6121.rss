    <title>Best-Worst Movies of 2010</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/best-worst-movies-of-2010/6121</link>
    <description>Greetings! 

Some movies that come out, they&#39;re lauded as the best thing since sliced bread and some are completely horrendous.  In 2010, you probably watched movies that you liked that were considered &quot;horrendous&quot; while you probably disliked movies that were considered &quot;God-like&quot;.  So, I&#39;d like to hear them and a reason why.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS LOCATED IN THIS THREAD!

&quot;Bad&quot; movie that I liked:
[url=&#39;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0938283/&#39;]The Last Airbender[/url] - I really enjoyed this flick.  I loved the special effects.  The kid playing Aang was great.  I enjoyed the ostracized Fire Nation prince.  Everything about that movie was fun and enjoyable to me.  And Aang kicked some serious ass.   :slight_smile:   Wonder if they&#39;ll make the training in the other elements considering how poorly this movie did... [4/5]

&quot;Good&quot; movie that I disliked:
[url=&#39;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/&#39;]Inception[/url] - I couldn&#39;t connect to any of the characters.  Ariadne seemed to be too easy-going about the whole concept of entering other people&#39;s dreams...got too good at constructing the world too fast.... Cobb being haunted by his wife just seemed rather silly and I hate the &#39;you only get pieces and we&#39;ll give you more pieces as we go along&#39; thing that they did in that movie regarding Cobb&#39;s wife.  The dream sequences felt like they weren&#39;t....&#39;dreamy&#39; enough (I guess that&#39;s the way to describe it).  You have completely normal scenes in the dreamstate except for when the van is crashing and the hotel spins around or people float or the town curled above Ariadne while she was messing with the dream...but that&#39;s still too &#39;real&#39; to suit me.  The dreamstates needed to be more...odd.  When you got to the James Bond-like snowy mountain dream, I was like, &quot;Ho hum&quot; even as things were exploding.  One dreamstate that I felt they did right was Cobb&#39;s dreamland with the crumbling city next to the ocean.  That was what all the dreamstates should&#39;ve been like.  And the cliffhanger ending with the top was, to me, facepalm-worthy.  [2/5]

Now, how about you?</description>

<p>Yeah, great movie indeed. But hey, I expect nothing less from David Fincher.</p>
<p>Just watched <span class="bbcode-b">Sunshine</span>, was on tv and I hadn’t seen it yet.<br>
It’s pretty much a really clever, much better acted version of Armageddon with a bit of Event Horizon. I only found the last part to be rather disappointing.</p>

            <p>I was slightly disappointed with Inception. I heard lots of great things about it, but when I finally checked it out a few days ago, it was pretty meh. The concept is great, but like acada said, only Cobbs felt like he had a story going. The rest of the cast are pretty forgetable, the only other name I remember from Inception is Saito, apart from that, they were just nameless faces there to fill the set.</p>
<p>I also had the feeling that at some points they wanted to add more depth to the characters, but decided to not go for it in the end (the totem of the girl springs to mind, I honestly thought it would be an important aspect to the character, since they focussed on it for a minute or so, but then it never got mentioned again).</p>
<p>Wasn’t impressed with Inception.</p>

<p>Masterpiece != Great movie</p>
<p>A masterpiece is beyond being great. As Daedalus said, movies that are regarded as masterpieces have three dimensional characters, as opposed to Inception, where only DiCaprio’s character isn’t a cardboard cutout.</p>

<p>It depends on what kinda movie you’re looking for.<br>
Movie’s that are only there to entertain a lot, don’t really need em. Like Avatar, for example. Which has extremely cliched characters. But it doesn’t matter because that’s not really the movie’s focus.</p>
<p>But if we’re talking about a masterpiece, I agree; it can’t be a masterpiece with one-dimensional characters.</p>
<p>In Inception it can kinda allow for one-dimensional characters because it’s sort of an experiment. But it would’ve benefited from better characters. I think if it’d left some of the technicalities in the dark (leave more open for discussion) and instead of those focussed a bit more on characters I think it could’ve been a masterpiece.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion; a masterpiece is a movie that is fantastic on all points. After which you can leave the cinema amazed, and without anything left to say. (Which I had with, for example, District 9 and the Shawshank Redemption. Which I do personally view as masterpieces)</p>

            <p>Kickass - good clean fun (but I liked <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1303828/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Defendor</a> more, I guess)<br>
Inception - overhyped but still quite ok (shallow characters, interesting idea)<br>
Harry Potter - I’ll wait for the other half to see the complete movie.</p>
<p>I hate it when they sell you half of the movie and you have to wait another year to see how it ends  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Next great idea will be episodic movies - because it works sooo well for the gaming industry.</p>

<p>ITT: general film discussion, eh? I thought this was about being a cool hipster and stuff</p>
<p>On topic:</p>
<p>I liked Avatar (yeah 2009 but I dont care). It was decent and it didn’t disappoint me as it gave me what it promised. Which was a decent movie with cool visuals.</p>
<p>I think Inception was good, but not “THE BEST FUCKING MOVIE EVER” as many people described it. So I kinda like, you know, disliked it, I guess.</p>

</aside>
<p>Avatar was a fine movie. Bland story, but did the job. And the visuals are amazing. And above all it was just thoroughly entertaining.</p>
<p>Inceptions is certainly not the best movie ever, but it’s still very good. I feel the emotions all kinda get lost in trying to understand the mechanics, but this improves if you watch it more than once. Still a solid 8,5 or so from me.</p>

<p>Man you need to go check that shit then man!<br>
Watch The Social Network, Kick Ass and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World while you’re at it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah and I recently rewatched Shutter Island myself, really excellent movie.</p>
