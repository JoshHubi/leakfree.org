    <title>The surprise zombie in Lambda Core</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-surprise-zombie-in-lambda-core/11185</link>
    <description>When you activate a generator (don&#39;t remember if 1st or 2nd one) there is a security guard zombie torso that appears behind you out of nowhere. This is plain stupid, as it&#39;s unrealistic because the zombie didn&#39;t have any place to come from, and also it doesn&#39;t leave the player almost any chance to counter it. It&#39;s like a zombie has been suddenly cheated into the game. This is just stupid and should be removed.</description>

<p>Personally, I think it’s not such a big deal and, also, it’s easily fixable: place an airduct behind the zombie. Make it lead vertically up, so that players can’t get far inside it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I kinda like this idea. Makes it so it’s too small for the player to crawl through and have the zombie appear and crawl out of it. Just some way to make it so the player can’t see it being spawned. That wouldn’t fly anywhere else.</p>

<p>Whiz around, get a jolt from sudden zombie appearance, switch to glock/MP5/Magnum/Shotgun/Crossbow/Tau Cannon/Gluon Gun/Crowbar and attack the head. Point blank with those weapons is guaranteed to mince that zombie within a second; you’d have to be admiring the detail of the switchbox for the zombie to actually leave you “almost any chance of countering it.”</p>

            <p>But, then again, when headcrabs (and other Xenians) appear, they’re accompanied by green lightning.  There’s nothing in that sequence that shows green lightning.</p>
<p>Me, I’ve played through that section a couple times now and I always forget about the torso-zombie after flipping the switch and it scares the dickens out of me each time.  I always have my back turned to the spawn point (I need all my concentration to pulling that switch; my MIT education needs to pay for itself, y’know) so when I turn around, AAAAAAHHHH!</p>

            <p>One simple thing that I could protest is that zombies do not start out as Zombies they start from Head Crabs and where humans and Head Crabs can appear anywhere the same goes for a zombie!</p>

<p>Edit: And I think if you’ve made it that far into the game “countering” enemies, shouldn’t really be an issue. even if you do’t have full time to react, the game isn’t supposed to be easy.</p>
