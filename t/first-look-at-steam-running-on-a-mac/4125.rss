[u]If some admin reads this, please eliminate this thread. It seems the other thread created before this one doesn&#39;t include the word &quot;mac&quot; in it&#39;s title, that&#39;s why when I searched for &quot;Steam Mac&quot; I didn&#39;t find anything. Sorry, won&#39;t happen again[/u]</description>

<p>Will Source SDK be ported?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>From now on, the sdk and every source game, even the old ones will run natively in a steam client for both microshaft and crapple. All new valve games will be released simultaneously for OSX, windows and the sex box. There is a linux client on the way.</p>
