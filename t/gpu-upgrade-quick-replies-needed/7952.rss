    <title>gpu upgrade quick replies needed</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gpu-upgrade-quick-replies-needed/7952</link>
    <description>Okay so I have an [b]XFX HD5750[/b], and there&#39;s an [b]HIS HD6850[/b] going on [url=&#39;https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=GX-041-HS&#39;]overclockers for £100[/url]. Daily deal only

I&#39;d sell on my current card, maybe about £50-£55 for that, so that would mean the upgrade cost would be about £50.

Is it worthwhile do you think? On anandtech I benched a [url=&#39;https://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/296?vs=291&#39;]5770 vs the 6850[/url] and it was about 10 fps in all situations.

Opinions?</description>

            <p>You shouldn’t get so worked up over upgrades.  PC tech really isn’t moving along like it used to, and at this point it’s basically going from playing Crysis at 50fps, to 60.</p>

            <p>Is the card any cheaper on <a href="http://newegg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">newegg.com</a> or <a href="http://pricewatch.com" rel="nofollow noopener">pricewatch.com</a>? What about their .co.uk equivalents? Shop around and enter “coupon code” into the search engine for that card…many sharp retailers drop codes or prices if you keep looking. You can also get really good deals on gpu’s by taking that 100 pounds and adding 30 to it and get a much better card.  Also, it may be a good idea to contact those resellers to find a distribution center in your country whenever possible.</p>

            <p>Well, the cards sold out while I was out of the house, so I guess this thread is suddenly null and void <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
