    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-games-having-graphical-glitches/2635</link>
    <description>Lately, there have been wierd graphical glitches happening to all source games I run on my laptop. I don&#39;t know what changed, but this wasn&#39;t happening when I first got my laptop.  Refer to the thumbnail for the exact problem, but the jist of it is all opaque textures with alpha blended portions of it appear transparent. It&#39;s not very cool.  How can I fix this? I run everything on the highest settings, with 4x MSAA. I have an Nvidia Quadro FX 770M. I&#39;m not really a computer guy when it comes to hardware, so I don&#39;t have the foggiest what the problem could be. Display drivers?

            <p>The difference is mainly in the drivers. Quadro drivers are optimized for offline rendering and <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> provide better image quality ingame. Also, the drivers have a lot of niffty interfaces for developer overlays.</p>
<p>This is most likely not a problem with the hardware, as hardwarefailures prodice much mor chaotic artifacts than this.</p>

            <p>whats funny though is that Geforce can utilize CUDA, so the proffesional rendering gap Quadro and GeForce is narrowing.</p>

            <p>Sounds like there might be a problem with the card itself. Does it have a warrenty? Just take it back if it does. Reasons like that is why I’ll never buy a laptop other than for college. Well that and because most manufacturers install fast processors and low end (mobile) gfx cards. The good laptops would cost me more than I would care to pay 4.</p>

            <p>It’s what it came with. I got it through my school, it was the best laptop on the list. I don’t even know what Quadro means in relation to the graphics card.</p>

            <p>Quadro? In a Laptop?<br>
Anyways, it could very well be the display driver, as Quadros are build for professional applications and therefore have special drivers - there might even be an option for making certain things transparent. I wouldn’t know, I’ve never bothered looking into the Quadro drivers…</p>
