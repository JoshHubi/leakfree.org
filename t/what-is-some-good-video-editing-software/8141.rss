    <title>What is some good video editing software?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-some-good-video-editing-software/8141</link>
    <description>Preferably something free.  I mainly just want to be able to encode my videos so 10 seconds of raw 1080p video doesn&#39;t take nearly 300 MB of my HDD space.

It would be nice to eventually start doing some editing on my videos as well, but right now my main priority is saving space.</description>

            <p>Personally I use Avid Media composer 6 and adobe premiere. Pinnacle studio is pretty good. But most of my work is done in avid or adobe. Final Cut blah hate it. got one at work sits and collects dust the noobs at work love it for some reason.</p>

            <p>I want (mostly) easy to convert and stitch videos together.  I don’t care about adding effects.  Guess I could give Windows Movie Maker a go.</p>

<p>I want to save space for videos that I end up keeping and not just uploading and forgetting about.</p>

            <p>Corel Video Studio, controls are a bit clumsy and functions are tucked away under all sorts of buttons and pull out menus but it gets the job done. I’d love to give Final Cut a go, but don’t have a Mac.</p>

            <p>Pinnacle VideoSpin is decent, don’t believe it’s free though.  If you just want to convert videos, I’d recommend HandBrake.  Windows Movie Maker should allow you to split movie files, which you can then individually convert.  Hope that helps :-).</p>
<p>Then again… if the idea is to save hard drive space, why shoot 1080p footage in the first place?  Unless you downloaded it that way.</p>
