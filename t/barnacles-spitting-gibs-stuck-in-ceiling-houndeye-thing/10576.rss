    <title>Barnacles spitting gibs stuck in ceiling + houndeye thing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/barnacles-spitting-gibs-stuck-in-ceiling-houndeye-thing/10576</link>
    <description>Very often when barnacle drops human gibs after being killed, a majority of them suffocates into ceiling and becomes stuck. I also noticed than barnacles can&#39;t catch and eat living houndeyes. They should, considering they are lighter than human body, which they can pull (proof: you can pick up houndeye body while you cannot human&#39;s)</description>
