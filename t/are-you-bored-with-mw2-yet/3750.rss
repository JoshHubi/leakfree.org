        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The only mission that fucking blew was the Russian Reichstag mission, the one with the unlimited German soldiers with pin-point gun accuracy pouring out of the doors, and the only way to end the waves of soldiers was to advance <span class="bbcode-i">but you can’t advance if the moment you pop your head out they all turn to fire at you regardless of what your fellow Russians are doing.</span></p>
<p>Another thing…friendly AI sucked the big one.  I think it was tailored to show that sometimes soldiers from both sides became friends.  Seriously, I’d stand somewhere where my friendly could clearly watch my back and aim down the front.  Lo and behold, some jackass breaks through where I can’t see, strolls down in front of my friendlies, and lights me up from behind.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Where the fuck were you guys!?</span></p>
<p>It was like I was the only one fighting the war sometimes.  At least MW gave you the figgin’ illusion your friends were actually doing <span class="bbcode-i">something</span>.</p>
<p>EDIT: And, it’s not just a WaW thing, all COD games do this, but why does the enemy have a personal vendetta against you?  As long as you are in cover, they pretend to fire at your friends, but as soon as you pop your head out, everyone’s priorities suddenly shift and they all decide to fire at you.  What makes you so important that they can’t be bothered to avert their fire at your teammates?</p>

            <p>Most of them are. But not the WaW. It’s the best CoD since CoD 2 (nostalgia, yes), because it actually has some form of balance between gameplay, and camping the whole time.</p>

            <p>I ended up really liking World at War. It came free with my video card when I bought it early last year.</p>
<p>Campaign was fun, immersive and had some replay value, multiplayer had really fun maps (not to mention Dedicated servers :V). Also seemed fairly balanced compared to the MW flavors of CoD.</p>
<p>I am a sucker for WW2 games though. I really want to see how Treyarch does Vietnam with the next game.</p>

<p>Seriously? I thought it was by far one of the worst. Infinite respawning enemies are an annoying mechanic, and most of it was monotonous.</p>

<p>Well yes, infinite respawns are one of my pet hates, but it did do a great job of capturing the feel of being on the front lines of WW2. The Pacific campaign was brilliantly displayed, a very authentic game. The European front had very likeable characters too, I still remember charging up the stairs of the Reichstag with Reznov and Chernov.</p>
<p>As a shooter it was only solid, but the game in general just gave a full sense of scale and, epicness really, to the war. I also love the soundtrack, Russian choirs and Japanese drums with techno and rock backings? Fuck yes.</p>

            <p>Very simple to get bored with it when the single player lasts around 8 hours and you instinctively hate people who normally play MW2 online.</p>
<p>Props to Bad Company though. At least it was different.</p>

            <p>(to the above)</p>
<p>I thought all the moviegame exeptions worked the other way around? The movie HAS to suck for the game to be good? Like Wolvarine: Origins, Or Excape from butcher bay? (pitch black was great, but COR was…hmmm)</p>
<p>I got bored as fuck half a week in.</p>
<p>My sheep friends keep sending me fucking invites.</p>
<p>I was so bored I made <a href="https://www.majhost.com/gallery/masterflood/randomstuff/codmwtweemo.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>.</p>
<p>Spelling errors from boredom. Wanted to make something to remind me never to pop that fucker in ever again. The front cover is an in-joke. Stems from the VGAs.</p>

            <p>most likely because people love to hate on Treyarch. They are like the suck compared to Infinity Ward for some reason.<br>
They made the horrible Quantum of Solace game too. It was just like I was playing COD.</p>

            <p>World at War had a pretty epic single-player, as well as a very creative Nazi Zombies mode, and co-op with all the nifty handicaps and cheats to enable made the campaign that much more re-playable!  The multiplayer was okay, but suffered from similar problems in other COD games, namely exploitation of cheap weapons and glitched camping spots here and there.  I honestly never understood why people hated on World at War so much in comparison to COD4, it took the COD4 engine and made a darker, grittier WWII game well worth playing. D:</p>

<p>Before I was like, meh Mw2 is not that gr8 of a game so I wont buy the next cod game. But now I’m so enraged by the ass fucking the pc community received, which is solely responsible for the fame and fortune of the franchise that I want infinity ward to know. I will steal your next game and feel good about it to regain the 60$ you stole from me and will recommend other gamers to do so. My point, never make another game for the pc, ever!</p>
<p>I’d like to note I’ve never condoned game piracy, but this is an exception.</p>

<p>You rebel, you. Just so you know, stealing one game isn’t gonna do shit to Activision, but you can go to jail for shoplifting.</p>
<p>Anyways, I personally enjoy MW2’s multiplayer (but then I haven’t played BC2 yet  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  ) but the ridiculously tiny size of each map and the same cycle of maps over and over again is beginning to enrage me because everyone knows every spot and is so goddamn <span class="bbcode-i">good</span>. If the maps were a bit larger and there was a decently sized amount of them (say, 20 or so as opposed to 9-10), then it’d be different. The maps aren’t even very big, it can’t be hard to make them.</p>

            <p>lol… you guys are hilarious.</p>
<p>but seriously. I had a semi-fun time gunning through MW2’s SP. but its MP is very generic and get boring quickly. The maps are too small.</p>
<p>So again, BC2’s SP was also semi-fun, but its MP is right on the spot and I play it all the time.</p>
<p>I guess it all comes down to. DUM-DU-DUM personal preference or taste.</p>
