            <p>Also, if a mirror (I know that the download from GameFront isn’t available anymore, it returns me a 403 error) provides only a zip file, try unzipping it. It could have inside the zip file, the installer and the md5 checker.</p>
<p>It happened to me ^^</p>

            <p>Sorry for bumping this old thread, I just want to add my two cents to help wayward Googlers solve this problem.</p>
<p>I got Error code 2 after downloading the Black Mesa files from GameFront.  I’m going to go out on a limb and suggest that GF is currently hosting a corrupted copy of the game, or at least that downloading the game from GF is unreliable-at-best and should be avoided.  This is a big problem, given that GF seems to be the Black Mesa team’s mirror-of-choice, and as such will probably be the first place people go to to get the game.</p>
<p>Instead, I used the latest version of uTorrent to download the official torrent pack found at ModDB.  With these files, the installer worked perfectly, and I am shooting headcrab zombies and vortigaunts in HD glory.</p>

            <p>This error occurs because ‘BlackMesa.7z’ is either corrupt or incomplete. To verify this, simply download <a href="https://getmd5checker.com/download/latest/Md5Checker.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">MD5 Checker</a>, and compare the MD5 checksums with those listed in the ‘BlackMesa.md5’ file.</p>
<p>To do this, simply place ‘BlackMesa-Setup.exe’, ‘BlackMesa.7z’, and ‘BlackMesa.md5’ (all three files are available via the various mirrors in the download section of this very site) into the same folder. Open ‘BlackMesa.md5’ in Notepad and run MD5 Checker. Add ‘blackmesa-setup.exe’ and ‘BlackMesa.7z’. The app will automatcially generate the MD5 checksum for each file as they’re added.</p>
<p>Now right-click the entry for ‘BlackMesa-Setup.exe’ and select ‘Compare Checksum’ copy &amp; paste it’s checksum in the ‘BlackMesa.md5’ file into the box. If they’re a match you should see ‘Same’ appear in the box next to the MD5 generated by MD5 Checker. Repeat this for ‘BlackMesa.7z’.</p>
<p>If a checksum doesn’t match, then that file is either corrupt or incomplete. You’ll have to re-download the file again. For reference, ‘BlackMesa.7z’ should be 3,298,098,513 bytes in size, and ‘BlackMesa-Setup.exe’ should be 827,720 bytes in size.</p>
