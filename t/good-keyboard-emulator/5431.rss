    <title>Good Keyboard Emulator</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/good-keyboard-emulator/5431</link>
    <description>So I am looking for a Keyboard emulator to allow me to make my controler (Xbox 360) work in programs that do not support controllers.  I would prefer one that allows for analog input to be assined to keys so I can use the analog sticks, triggers and directional pad on the controler but as long as it works I&#39;m ok I guess.  Any recommendations?</description>

            <p>i found joystick2mouse to be a pretty good program since it also works on 7 x64, I’m pretty sure it can emulate any button on the keyboard</p>
