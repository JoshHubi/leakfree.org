    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hidden-hat-impossibility-fixed/9929</link>
    <description>Hi, I posted this as a small note in my other bug thread, but I wanted to post it separately because it&#39;s an achievement breaker. Once you get the hat to the Lambda Core teleportation puzzle... I throw it through the portal, and it lands on the spinning platform. I wait for it to come back around and follow through the portal. It was at that point that I found out I couldn&#39;t interract with the hat while it was on the platform. I could shoot it off and pick it up below, but there was no way to get it through the portals.</description>

            <p>Thanks for that.</p>
<p>I was thinking it was “way back” long before the one in the assassin warehouse.</p>

            <p>I didn’t have to climb. I was able to just drop it over the fence and it luckily landed on the ledge. I then picked it up after teleporting as I circled.</p>

<p>Where is the first one?</p>
<p>EDIT: Found this in a youtube comment.</p>
<p>Inside a shipping container in the last assassin﻿ area.<br>
mergatroidevans 21 hours ago</p>
<p>Ironic because I was thinking of trying to get in there to find some supplies and I didn’t because I couldn’t make the jump, didn’t think of stacking stuff to get up.</p>

            <p>Maybe, but since I’m assuming there is going to be a load through the portal, and trigger load won’t work on an entity (as far as I know, because the map isn’t loaded yet), the only trigger for the achievement should be when the hat touches the portal. To get it through the load, they could toggle a global variant, causing a “new” hat to spawn in Xen… But throwing it into the portal should be enough.</p>

            <p>POSSIBLE SPOILER:</p>
<p>If you go sideways through the entrance portal while holding the hat, you’ll pop out the exit still holding the hat.</p>
<p>As for me, I just couldn’t get it to Xen.  I carried it with me when I jumped into the portal, and I tried throwing it into the portal ahead of me, multiple times, but the achievement never registered.</p>

<p>That’s weird. I will try it myself and see if i get the same problem, since i haven’t tried that yet (just threw it on some random portals).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I found out that same thing on the first rotating platform. I used a couple of barrels in the previous hallway (marked “Coolant”) to get over the “fence” in the first portal room. That way I could carry it, and throw it along. The problem on the first platform didn’t seem to be an issue on the next two(?) platforms. I managed to get all the way to the last portal to Xen, but throwing it in there didn’t give me the achievement anyway. :[</p>
<p>Anyone got a solution for that?</p>
<p>Edit: Note that you have to time it carefully over the “fence”, to soon and you’ll get smashed for some reason. Collision issue I guess.</p>
