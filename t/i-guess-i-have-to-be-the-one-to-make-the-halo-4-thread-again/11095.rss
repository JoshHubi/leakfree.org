Sound design still fucking incredible with a decent system. I have a feeling this is going to be the main point of complaint from people who don&#39;t have any sub.</description>

            <p>Just started reading Silentium a few days ago. It’s easily the best book of the Forerunner trilogy by far.</p>
<p>Plus we finally get to understand what Guilty Spark meant when he told Chief, “Last time you asked me, if it were my choice, would I do it?”</p>
<p>… only the makers of Halo would wait 12 years before explaining one of the most cryptic lines in the games…</p>

            <p>The arches are indestructable to all things (except the halos), and ancient humans build many cities along the arches (so it can be assumed that either they provided some atmosphere or the arches already have a atmosphere)</p>
<p>The Domain is a information network not located in normal space-time (presumabally slipspace?) that the forerunners use to archive all their history</p>
<p>The Flood revealed to the Librarian that the Domain was the long mythologized “Organon”, which is a precursor relic that had the power to control all other precursor tech</p>
<p>the Domain/Organon also happened to be a Precursor consciousness</p>
<p>and apparently, it survived the halo firings (as evidenced by the terminals in the games)</p>

<p>So are the precursors and forerunners two different races, or…?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>they are 2 different races</p>
<p>but the precursors are the reason forerunners, humans (and all life in the Milky Way) exist</p>
<p>the precursors’ technology is far superior to forerunners/prehistoric Humans<br>
as they have a reach throughout the universe (some of their relics dont even exist in our space-time, the domain is a perfect example of this)</p>
<p>they are capable of making “orbital arches” that “connect” worlds and star systems together</p>
<p>and some of them turned themselves into powder that grew infectious and eventually became the flood (their powder forms were originally meant to allow them to be reborn in future times, had space diseases not tampered with it)</p>

            <p>Major spoilers</p>
<p>Halo silentium is out and alot of things have been revealed</p>
<p>-Precursors went into hiding and/or turned themselves into powder that would grow themselves back into their former selves; but the said powder grew diseases through time and perpetuates the flood infection; flood = reincarnated precursors</p>
<p>-The Domain is actually a precursor Essence created by precursors that contains 100 billion years worth of history</p>
<p>-A precursor relic encountered in the Galaxy <span class="bbcode-i">Large Magellanic Cloud</span> (called Path Kethona by forerunners), has the power to “crush” and “shrink” a planet  (this could very well appear in halo 5/6)</p>

            <p>bornstellder didact travelled across the universe according to the Silentium previews</p>
<p>while ur-didact survived his flood trap (presumabally during the time of that terminal where he rallys his mechanical/“COMPOSED” prometheans)</p>
<p>OR maybe ur-didact’s “execution” was actually at the hands of the Librarian (remeber the terminals?) but in reality he was just crippled and stored in a Cryptum for 100,000 years (until his re-awakening by john117)</p>
<p>its hard to tell, no realizing how much of the halo 4 terminals contradict the halo 3 terminals and Forerunner saga books</p>
