    <description>Figured I&#39;d post this here since it just went up on the steam store for pre-order

Pre-ordering from here gets you the digital deluxe edition:

Pre-Purchase Natural Selection 2 and receive a free upgrade to the Digital Deluxe Edition! The Digital Deluxe Edition includes:

Official Soundtrack

Almost 1 hour of tribal, industrial music composed by David John and Simon Chylinski. This includes all the music from our trailers and videos.

Digital Art Book

40+ pages of concept art by Cory Strader, including environments, creatures, weapons and more. Cory discusses the process behind designing the unique technological/animal look in the game.

Exclusive Wallpapers and Avatars

Community artist Rantology created some of the best and most unique views of creatures in the NS universe. Custom Steam avatars complete the package.

Exclusive in-game marine model

A new marine model with custom visor and equipment makes you look distinctive in-game. Existing owners of the original &quot;Black Armor&quot; marine will be able to choose between any models they own.

Note If you have pre-purchased Natural Selection 2 previously, you will receive the upgrade to the Digital Deluxe Edition.

It&#39;s also $10 cheaper then when it wasn&#39;t on steam, though I&#39;m okay having payed for it since my original purpose was more to support the devs than anything, as well as getting into the beta which is now locked (since it&#39;s coming out soon).

I highly recommend this to fans of competitive and teamwork-oriented games (and fans of AvP-styled games), as well as RTS fans if you can stomach the pressure being a good commander requires  :slight_smile:  at $25, you can&#39;t really go wrong, especially for how rewarding it is to play this game (at least IMO)</description>

            <p>no if a toaster could run NS2 that would be one good toaster… na I was running it on the coffee maker</p>
<p>In all truth I have been trying to upgrade or get a new computer for a few years now, sunk 100 dollars into this thing to get a new power source and graphics card. this comp may suck but It can run hl2 on high so not much to complain about.</p>
