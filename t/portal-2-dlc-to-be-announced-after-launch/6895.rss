    <title>&#39;Portal 2&#39; DLC to be announced after launch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portal-2-dlc-to-be-announced-after-launch/6895</link>
    <description>Valve has confirmed that downloadable content will be coming to Portal 2.

&quot;We have a DLC that we&#39;re going to be announcing,&quot; he revealed. &quot;Really can&#39;t give you any detail [until] after launch, and we&#39;re going to have some details about how that&#39;ll get released and what that&#39;ll form forthcoming.&quot;
When asked whether the content will comprise of new stages, Faliszek replied: &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot;.

Faliszek also explained that the &quot;most important&quot; aspect of Steam support for PC, Mac and PS3 was that they could be regularly patched to enable cross-platform play.

&quot;It&#39;ll let us update more frequently, which is a big thing especially because the PS3, PC and Mac can all play together,&quot; he said.
&quot;And so why they might not get every single patch as some are PC-dependant or just for the PS3, it&#39;ll let us keep those in sync so they can do the cross-platform play. So that was the most important [thing].&quot;

Portal 2 will be available on PC, Mac and consoles from April 19 in North America and April 21 in Europe.  :slight_smile:

I am glad that valve does not charge for DLC games on steam, so this DLC of Portal 2 that is coming I guess it will be free.</description>

<p>I knocked out the whole thing in about 2 hours last weekend.  The last test took us longer than it should have because we were both tired and didn’t think to look at the walls at the top of the room after flinging up there &gt;&lt;</p>
<p>I am interested in this new co-op campaign, but only if it doesn’t use the stupid white gel.</p>

            <p>Whether or not you find the co-op easy or hard, it’s still a lot of fun when you’re playing with someone you know (as Atlas or P-Body).  I never co-op with strangers by the way.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">    <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

            <p>You know, I’ve been thinking. When Valve gives you DLCs, don’t play the DLCs! Make Mods, take the DLCs back! Get mad! I don’t want your damn DLCs! What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see Valves manger! Make Valve rue the day they thought they could give DrasarSalman DLCs! Do you know who I am? I’m the fan who is going to mod your game! With the game! I’m going to get my googleing to make me find a way to invent a sdk that will mod Portal 2!</p>
<p>The point is: If Valve could give out a sdk for all the source engines until now, why can’t the sdk for portal 2 be out yet? So I have the internet figuring that out now. Sdk hacking. Changing a source to accept another one. I should have done that 5 days ago. I’m going to post this- and I am going post this in this thread so that you can read it a hundred times a day: If I get bored before Valve can pour their tools out on the internet, I will break my Alien Swarm sdk.</p>
