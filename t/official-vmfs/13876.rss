    <title>Official VMFs?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/official-vmfs/13876</link>
    <description>I was wondering if Black Mesa will release a handful of the official VMF map files to demonstrate some &quot;best practices&quot; examples, much like what Valve did with the d1_trainstation levels and Source SDK, or the example maps in Left 4 Dead.  I couldn&#39;t find any in the common/Black Mesa folder.  I think experienced mappers can piece together a lot of stuff on their own, but having an example VMF or two would be nice.</description>
