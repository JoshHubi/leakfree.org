    <description>Hey everyone.

I hate having to write posts like this, but I&#39;ve had a few people come to me over the past few days warning me about a new Source Engine Server exploit that is making the rounds across various games. There has been some reports that Black Mesa MP Servers[i] could[/i] be the target of the exploit, if someone with malicious intent wants it to. Until Valve (and then us) patch a fix in, I&#39;ve made this post to inform everyone of potential danger and steps on how to avoid infection.

[b]What is the exploit?[/b]
I don&#39;t want to go into details on how to replicate the exploit, but I will say what it does, as I understand it. If you load up into an infected Source Server, the exploit allows the server to inject a file into your computers start up folder. You won&#39;t know this happens. When you launch your computer again (ie, it starts up again) the file will be executed and bad stuff happens. This exploit/infection can only occur if the server is set up to do it, that is someone needs to set up the server to cause it to happen.

[b]How do I know if a server is infected?[/b]
As far as I know, there is nothing that says &quot;THIS SERVER IS INFECTED!&quot; I don&#39;t know of any current ways to check. Your best bet is to make sure that you are connecting to our official servers, or servers where you know that the server host has personally checked to make sure the exploit is not active. A list of our official servers are listed below, with IP. Additionally, when you connect to a server, connect to it directly via IP, not via the server browser list.

[b]What can I do to prevent getting hit by this exploit?[/b]
Like I mentioned before, only connect to trusted servers via the console command &quot;connect &lt;IP&gt;.&quot;  Additionally, make sure that the server you&#39;re connected to is trusted to not be infected and if you can check with the server admin to check, that is even better. Since it&#39;s very easy to make a server with the same name as your favourite server, this will  ensure that you are connecting to the server you want to connect to. Also, check to see if the server you&#39;re connecting to has a name that is an exact copy. If there are two servers with the same name, it&#39;s possible that one could be infected. Use caution or avoid the server entirely.

[b]What should I do if I think I&#39;ve been infected?[/b]
Immediately run a virus scan. There are many free antivirus scanners online. I personally have used AVG and Avast! but if you have a favourite, then you can use that. Additionally check your start up folder to make sure that any files in there are not suspicious or malicious.


While we all know that Black Mesa has the biggest MP population of any MP game ever (that was sarcasm and a joke, by the way), we can make sure everyone stays safe. If everyone is vigilant and careful with the servers they connect to, follow the steps I&#39;ve provided above and just use a little bit of common sense, no one will be infected.

If you have any questions, please ask them in this thread.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>One could also remove the write permissions to ‘shell :s tartup’ and ‘shell:common startup’. I don’t see why windows would allow anything to be copied there if not even the system has permission to write to that folder.</p>
<p>Are there any fixes for this so far from Valve?</p>

Official IP:    31.186.250.106:27070</p>
<p>Any news regarding this server can be found <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeAreUnitedGamers" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></p>
<p>Pay attention what servers you connect to as they may be set up to impersonate other servers &amp; drop malware on to connected clients that think they are joining the legit server.</p>
<p>Great job posting about this to warn users.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
I had a chat some days ago with Leystryku (the guy who found this exploit &amp; others) and Steam ID spoofing being possible came into discussion, why do i mention this you ask ?</p>
<p>Because 99% of servers only use Steam ID’s to authenticate admins.</p>
<p>A previously legit / trusted server could be compromised by someone spoofing the Steam ID of a root admin and modifying the previously clean server to distribute malware to its users.</p>
<p>Official Black Mesa servers are not affected by this as they do not run any admin mods as far as i am aware, community servers however can be targeted.</p>
<p>United Gamers has &amp; will always have its security &amp; the security of it’s players as an absolute top priority.</p>
<p>If you run game servers &amp; care about your user’s security, please add password authentication for all the admins on your server.</p>
<p>I’ve also posted about this here some days ago in case its of any use. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/412447613578762469/#c412448158140436412" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/412447613578762469/#c412448158140436412</a></p>

<p>I hate having to write posts like this, but I’ve had a few people come to me over the past few days warning me about a new Source Engine Server exploit that is making the rounds across various games. There has been some reports that Black Mesa MP Servers<span class="bbcode-i"> could</span> be the target of the exploit, if someone with malicious intent wants it to. Until Valve (and then us) patch a fix in, I’ve made this post to inform everyone of potential danger and steps on how to avoid infection.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is the exploit?</span><br>
I don’t want to go into details on how to replicate the exploit, but I will say what it does, as I understand it. If you load up into an infected Source Server, the exploit allows the server to inject a file into your computers start up folder. You won’t know this happens. When you launch your computer again (ie, it starts up again) the file will be executed and bad stuff happens. This exploit/infection can only occur if the server is set up to do it, that is someone needs to set up the server to cause it to happen.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How do I know if a server is infected?</span><br>
As far as I know, there is nothing that says “THIS SERVER IS INFECTED!” I don’t know of any current ways to check. Your best bet is to make sure that you are connecting to our official servers, or servers where you know that the server host has personally checked to make sure the exploit is not active. A list of our official servers are listed below, with IP. Additionally, when you connect to a server, connect to it directly via IP, not via the server browser list.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What can I do to prevent getting hit by this exploit?</span><br>
Like I mentioned before, only connect to trusted servers via the console command “connect .”  Additionally, make sure that the server you’re connected to is trusted to not be infected and if you can check with the server admin to check, that is even better. Since it’s very easy to make a server with the same name as your favourite server, this will  ensure that you are connecting to the server you want to connect to. Also, check to see if the server you’re connecting to has a name that is an exact copy. If there are two servers with the same name, it’s possible that one could be infected. Use caution or avoid the server entirely.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What should I do if I think I’ve been infected?</span><br>
Immediately run a virus scan. There are many free antivirus scanners online. I personally have used AVG and Avast! but if you have a favourite, then you can use that. Additionally check your start up folder to make sure that any files in there are not suspicious or malicious.</p>
<p>While we all know that Black Mesa has the biggest MP population of any MP game ever (that was sarcasm and a joke, by the way), we can make sure everyone stays safe. If everyone is vigilant and careful with the servers they connect to, follow the steps I’ve provided above and just use a little bit of common sense, no one will be infected.</p>
