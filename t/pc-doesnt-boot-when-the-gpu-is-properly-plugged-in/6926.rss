    <title>PC doesn&#39;t boot when the GPU is properly plugged in.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pc-doesnt-boot-when-the-gpu-is-properly-plugged-in/6926</link>
    <description>So,  recieved my new computer today, put it all together, and when i tried to boot it, nothing happened.

After some troubleshooting i found out that if i take out the two PCI-E connectors out from the back of the GPU, the computer boots, but beeps an error message that indicates that it couldn&#39;t find any VGA.

Here is my specs:

            <p>well, to my defense, the mounting section in the motherboard said nothing about the standoffs…</p>

<p>Yeah, I didn’t read every post until later.</p>
<p>Frankly, I’m wondering how his PC booted at all without those (and didn’t just short out).</p>

<p>What the fuck dude those standoffs are extremely important, consider yourself lucky you didn’t permanently damage your motherboard. Read the manual before building a computer!</p>

            <p>holy shit</p>
<p>I didn’t realize you’re this clueless.</p>
<p>This is why I always recommend you fully disassemble an old PC before building your own.</p>
<p>But you’re lucky your PSU has short circuit protection, otherwise that mobo and/or PSU would have been fried for good.</p>

            <p>That was the next thing I was going to ask, did you use all the brass stand offs for the case/motherboard. They look like <span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span> this. You may have damaged your motherboard if you didn’t use them and screwed straight into the case.</p>

            <p>Then raise it off the steel cabinet and see if it works.</p>
<p>Edit: That’s probably the source of the short. But when you don’t know what’s wrong with your computer, you want to do what is referred in my last post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides the above, if you want to test if it’s the mobo, the graphics card, or your RAM, I would suggest doing a bare-bones system boot.</p>
<p>(Mobo, power supply, CPU (with fan), Graphics card, and RAM; nothing else) and see if it boots then. If it works, then systematically plug in each component till it doesn’t boot up properly. Log the last part, remove it, then try everything else.</p>
<p>If it DOESN’T then try another Graphics card or swapping out other parts for different ones that are supported with the mobo (if you have any).</p>
<p>About 6 months ago my 8600 graphics card blew up on me and I didn’t know (video stopped working, and when I did a reboot, it wouldn’t post; ‘beep’). This method is how I diagnosed it… person I live with has a metric shit ton of computer parts laying around, so it was pretty easy to swap out parts, etc.</p>
<p>That will help narrow it down. Then again it’s a lot less time consuming to just complain to the company about their faulty product (if you bitch enough you might get a discount  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  but good luck with that). It’s up to you on what you want to do.</p>

<p>Then if you’re clueless, that’s when you ask for help.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make sure your memory is supported by the motherboard (the manual always includes a vendor list). Like Sersoft said, if the memory is not supported by the mobo that doesn’t mean it won’t work but that’s not always the case.<br>
The first thing you should do with a new computer is go to the BIOS and set the proper timings and voltages for the memory. If you have to overclock the CPU to achieve 1600 MHz on the memory then I suggest you stick to a lower frequency for now.</p>
<p>People tend to overlook memory when building a computer, this is a very bad idea. Memory problems are a major pain in the ass and you really want to avoid them at all cost.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>Note that the that the maximum supported memory frequency is 1333 MHz so when you set the memory frequency in the BIOS you’re gonna have to go under 1600 MHz unless you overclock the CPU. Don’t forget to set the timings and voltages, really important.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>Same goes for the motherboard, supports up to 1333 MHz unless you overclock like I mentioned earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Besides the above, if you want to test if it’s the mobo, the graphics card, or your RAM, I would suggest doing a bare-bones system boot.</p>
<p>(Mobo, power supply, CPU (with fan), Graphics card, and RAM; nothing else) and see if it boots then. If it works, then systematically plug in each component till it doesn’t boot up properly. Log the last part, remove it, then try everything else.</p>
<p>If it DOESN’T then try another Graphics card or swapping out other parts for different ones that are supported with the mobo (if you have any).</p>
<p>About 6 months ago my 8600 graphics card blew up on me and I didn’t know (video stopped working, and when I did a reboot, it wouldn’t post; ‘beep’). This method is how I diagnosed it… person I live with has a metric shit ton of computer parts laying around, so it was pretty easy to swap out parts, etc.</p>
<p>That will help narrow it down. Then again it’s a lot less time consuming to just complain to the company about their faulty product (if you bitch enough you might get a discount  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  but good luck with that). It’s up to you on what you want to do.</p>

            <p>well if your ram wasn’t compatible then it would beep even with the GPU plugged in</p>
<p>also, I never used RAM that’s listed in my mobo manual, yet it works fine after 2 upgrades</p>

            <p>well, there are some leds on the mainboard that randomly blinks, those are labeled “DRAM_LED”, “BOOT_DEVICE_LED” and “VGA_LED”.</p>
<p>Could it be RAM? in the book that came with the mainboard there is a list of supported 1600 mhz DDR3 ram, and my RAM is not listed there.</p>
