    <title>HALF-LIFE: RESURRECTION: The Forgotten and Unfinished Expansion Pack</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-resurrection-the-forgotten-and-unfinished-expansion-pack/9056</link>
    <description>Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, someone was working on his own &quot;expansion pack&quot; for HL1. It was a modification, but it was an ambitious mod which he intended to continue the story of the first game. I think Planet Half-Life used to host the site, but no longer. The plot of the mod assumes that you accepted the G-Man&#39;s offer, and involves Gordon trying to deal with a terrorist organization which is kidnapping Black Mesa scientists and forcing them to open portals to Xen. 

The concept was really cool, and there were already screenshots for all the chapters for the mod. The guy behind it was even interviewed about the mod, and I hoped that it would be able to be released around the time of OPPOSING FORCE. It never was released, and I tried searching for any traces of it with little success. 

I think that mod was called HALF-LIFE: RESURRECTION, but it could have been another title. As I said before, I searched for it again, and although I found a &quot;Resurrection&quot; site for HL, it was for a whole bunch of unfinished mods unrelated to what I remember. Any HL veterans remember this mod?</description>

            <p>Wasn’t his point. They have same storylines and HL was inspired by the book’s storyline. :facepalm: Also, the person trying to be clever asking if Half-life’s plot is lame is a fucking idiot. and the “resurrection” plot OP explained does appear to be a shitty 0 out of 10 storyline. Gordon, terrorists… just no.</p>

            <p>CygNuS, I just wanted to say: THANK YOU! I really appreciate the effort it took you to retrieve this site. It’s a bit battered with age, but my memories are already flooding backing from beholding this website again. For some reason, the HL Resurrection’s story doesn’t appear on the site anymore. I do hope that the e-mail for the TC’s creator still is functioning, because I am quite curious as to what happened to this ambitious project.</p>
<p>The failure of this project reminds me of what happened to a planned “Mission Pack” for BLOOD 2, “REVELATIONS,” which also was never completed or released.</p>
<p>I give thanks to the guys who believed me when I said that Resurrection not Redemption. I’ve seen a bit of Redemptions gameplay, but it never had any of the features, weapons, enemies, or plot promised in Resurrection.</p>
<p>I’ll have to explore the archived site a little more, and see what else I can find.</p>

            <p>CygNuS and Waybackmachine website to the rescue!!</p>
<p>This is the archived main page for their mod (<a href="http://halflife.net/blacksun" rel="nofollow noopener">halflife.net/blacksun</a>) from 2000:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815070936/https://www.halflife.net/blacksun/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://web.archive.org/web/20000815070936/https://www.halflife.net/blacksun/</a><br>
Takes some seconds to load…<br>
Their last update was from august 2000.</p>
<p>There’s mention of some mod developers (nick-)names, (Greg Spencer, Jeroen Loffeld, Kolmek, …) and also an e-mail address <a href="mailto:Kolmek@halflife.net" data-bbcode="true">Kolmek@halflife.net</a><br>
You might be able to still contact them somehow lol  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Click “For Non-Flash Menu Click Here” on the left<br>
Then click the 6th button for the <span class="bbcode-b">Screenshots</span> page and 7th for the <span class="bbcode-b">Weapons</span> page.<br>
There are still some working screens in there (e.g. Game shots 3)  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I clicked around a lot but nothing else appears to be archived.</p>

            <p>No, it was not renamed, it simply didn’t come to life, I’m sure of it. Redemption was made by Maverick Development, but he says that this “HL Resurrection” mod was done by Blacksun Entertainment, it isn’t the same team</p>

            <p>I recall purchasing CS back in the day, Redemption was definitely included. I have no recollection of this “Resurrection” mod.</p>

            <p>It is decades old, sadly. I just thought that some old timer HALF-LIFE veterans might’ve remembered it, even though I might’ve been the only one who was into it. :[ Even worse, no one in PHL remembers it either, but it’s still nice to remember.</p>

            <p>It’s DEFINITELY NOT Redemption. I tried checking out information on Redemption to see if it is connected to Resurrection, but it isn’t. Resurrection was a totally differently planned mod entirely.</p>
<p>And I do have some proof that it existed. These few pieces of Planet Half-Life news from their old archives.</p>

<p>Sadly, Blacksun Entertainment doesn’t seem to exist anymore. I wish their site was archived.</p>
<p>This is proof that I am talking about Resurrection and not Redemption.</p>
<p>As for you guys who say the story sucks, we don’t know what the full story was, so you shouldn’t jump to conclusions just because my brief sentence descriptions were lacking.</p>

            <p>i was thinking it was redemption as well. though i remember redemption being allot harder, first patch of enemys where the female assassins and grunts if i recall.</p>
<p>but i do agree the story line sounds a bit cliche and crap.</p>
