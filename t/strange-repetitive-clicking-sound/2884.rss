    <title>Strange repetitive clicking sound.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/strange-repetitive-clicking-sound/2884</link>
    <description>For some reason, my computer is making this clicking noise, it would occasionally stop for 2-10 or so seconds, then makes the clicking sound again. I overclocked my graphics card a very small bit, and for some reason my computer keeps making this weird clicking noise. Any ideas?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This happend to me before, I did a disk check to solve it.</p>
<p>Right click on your main HD (C: in this example), click properties then click on the “tools” tab. Click on error checkign then tick both boxes, run it then restart your PC, ti will do qutie a logn check to see if there is antyhing wrong with your HDD or system file sand try to fix it.</p>
<p>Kind regards<br>

<p>Scout,</p>
<p>I strongly advise you not to waste any more time resetting anything until after you’ve backed up all your data… do it NOW, before you do <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> else. You’ll have all the time in the world to look for other solutions after you’ve done that … and your data will be safe, whether your hard drive suddenly stops working or not.</p>
<p>If there’s a clicking sound coming from your computer, 9 times out of 10 it’s a warning that a hard drive is about to fail. This could be in 10 days, 10 minutes or… in the next <span class="bbcode-i">10 seconds</span>. The is only thing you can be really sure of is that if it really is your hard drive that’s clicking - then it’s already in the process of going kaput. That clicking sound is the only warning you’re going to get defore it dies.</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>ps: Don’t back  up your data on the same hard drive that’s making the clicking noise… but you knew that didn’t you?</p>
<p>(Don’t laugh, it’s been done before… “I don’t see what the problem is, I put the backup on a completly separate new partition!”)</p>

            <p>I had a similar noise coming from my old computer once, turned out my hard drive was making the it. It was a PATA Seagate Barracuda 80gb and not long afterwards it stop working. Luckily it wasn’t my primary hard drive!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Hiya Scout…</p>
<p>Sounds as if your hard disk, (or one of your hard disks), is on the way out, so back up all the data on it right away… and I mean<span class="bbcode-b"> NOW</span>!!.. before it fails completly and simply stops working.</p>
<p>Just to make sure, open up up your case and check that the source of the clicking really is the hard drive - it’s normally pretty easy to hear exactly where the sound is coming from. If it <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> the hard drive, back up the data <span class="bbcode-b">right away</span> and replace the unit.</p>

            <p>Yes that.</p>
<p>Plus I am still thinking he should pop open the case and leave it open while he reboots it so that he can try to get a visual of where exactly it is coming from.</p>

            <p>…<br>
WELL</p>
<p>I had a similar problem with my old comp, I had a ticking noise for a while. I never found the source of it but I’m pretty sure it was my old CRT monitor. It eventually went away. I’m still running it to date :retard: old monitors FTW</p>
<p>Try unplugging the speakers.<br>
Check wires and see they’re not snagged in anything.<br>
Run a stability test.</p>

<p>But ya, first find the source of the clicking like what component is it coming from so you won’t explode your computer from ripping out the wrong hardware.</p>

            <p>I would suggest you all stop gang beating this guy. You were all 13 once. I’ve read back on the stuff he posted, yeah it’s stupid, but he doesn’t deserve the treatment you’re all giving him.</p>
<p>Also, SoaringScout, just ignore them and focus on the ON TOPIC responses you might get. Responding is like giving a troll a cookie and expecting it to just leave. If they really start getting at you then find a new forum, I am empathetic with what you could be going though and it isn’t fun.</p>

<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]…blah blah blah…stupid comments must stop NOW, otherwise THIS ginger is kicking everyone in the groin.</p>
<p>If you overclocked your video card or whatever it is you overclocked and the ticking started have you gone back to default settings to see if the clicking and hesitations stop? That would have been the first thing to do. If it happens still then I would investigate other options. How old is your hard drive and what’s the brand?</p>

<p>For some reason, my computer is making this clicking noise, it would occasionally stop for 2-10 or so seconds, then makes the clicking sound again. I overclocked my graphics card a very small bit, and for some reason my computer keeps making this weird clicking noise. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Also, I spelled Geiger wrong, and the spellchecker suggested “Ginger”.</p>
