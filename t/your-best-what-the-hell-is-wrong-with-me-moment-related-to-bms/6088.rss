    <description>-Having non-gamer wifey walk past me, see what site I was on, and say &quot;Isn&#39;t that crap OUT yet?&quot;

-Checking the forums on my phone while in an interview with an Office of Civil Rights investigation lawyer (knitting my brow and nodding slowly...) 

-Checking in, seeing the Xmas decorations on the Main Page, and keeping it open in the background while I got my work done &#39;cause I KNEW right when I clicked back there was going to be an update or some news to devour!

-Audible saying &quot;Aw, shit!&quot; when there wasn&#39;t anything special, and having to tell my wife why I was saying &quot;Aw, shit!&quot; if front of the kids.

...you?</description>
