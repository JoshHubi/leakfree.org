    <title>Guns missing from inventory!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/guns-missing-from-inventory/10113</link>
    <description>When I started Surface tension, guns started to disappear from my inventory. Now all I have left is the starter pistol and the crowbar. Has this happened to anyone else?
Update: now the pistol is always facing downwards, as if I was pointing it at an NPC in HL2.</description>

            <p>I had a similar problem, which was 100% reproducible, when going from the first map of surface tension to the last map of questionable ethics. It would take away my tau, shotgun, mp5 and crossbow</p>

            <p>It’s no good, now saves are mysteriously deleting themselves  and my telsa gun is permanently gone from my inventory. I might not be able to continue the game from this point… Does anyone know some console code I could use just to get it back?</p>

            <p>Yep it happened to me. I restarted from the previous level and they appeared again. I’m using the manual save a lot as it appear that the Autosave isn’t always working.</p>
