            <p>Well, they haven’t made an <em>isolated</em> single player game since the Orange Box. Portal 2 had co-op, Left 4 Dead/2 was built around it, Dota 2 is a MOBA, etc. Hell, even HL2’s retail release came with CSS packed in, so technically the only ACTUAL stand-alone release with no MP component would probably be Episode One. No wonder it’s my favorite…</p>
<p>OH WAIT DIDN’T EPISODE ONE SHIP WITH HL2DM AND HLDM:S PACKED IN IT I’M AN IDIOT FAIL</p>

            <p>I just interpreted it as: If you’re going to get HL3 sometime in the future don’t expect it to be like the jump between EP1 and EP2 but rather like the jump between Portal and Portal2. When they take so long, they have to make major improvements and redesigns, yet some people still want something like HL2 but with new Story (Basically what EP1 and EP2 have been)<br>
I’m okay with them taking so long because it’s valve and what they’ll give us will be most likely something groundbreaking again. And its better than shitting out the same thing every year COD-Style.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It always makes me sad whenever I hear Gabe or someone else from Valve talk about how multiplayer and community-based stuff is all they want to do going forward. I don’t hate multiplayer games, but it feels like less and less of the worthwhile higher-budget games, especially FPS games, coming out are going for a properly executed and/or story-driven singleplayer  experience, and I’ve always been more of a singleplayer guy.<br>
I’m all for having a multiplayer component, but the ability to experience a story on my own is always going to be a big draw.</p>
<p>It also makes me sad hearing Gabe say that they’re not going to do “retro” stuff because they’ve learned a lot doing multiplayer stuff. I could be wrong, but it kind of sounds like he’s discounting that there’s either a) any value in singleplayer content, or b) the fact that new knowledge and technology doesn’t mean that older knowledge or tech has value.</p>
<p>I know a guy (in the same Uni game development program as me) who says that Doom has nothing to offer because we have Call of Duty now- never minding that Doom is still a blast to play, or that they’re completely different styles of play; To him, the newest thing is the only thing worthwhile, and there’s nothing to enjoy or learn from the past. I feel like that’s a really narrow, shallow mindset, thinking that there’s nothing worth learning from in history.</p>
<p>Remember what Adam Foster did with the Portal ARGs? That was all utilizing old tech - and it was awesome.</p>
