As title says. Not just the first background map... the entire game is stuck.

mat_fullbright does not help.</description>

            <p>I can’t seem to force black mesa to use my amd card. Damn :<br>
Nvm fixed it. But now it doesn’t let me set shadows to high.<br>
I had the same problem with half-life 2 but I fixed it with these start up commands -force_device_id 0x1180 -dxlevel 98<br>
Black mesa doesn’t seem to fall for it though.</p>
<p>PS: Ah screw it fullbright resets again. I’ll deal with it when I have time I guess.</p>

<p>We have a list of immediate issues to resolve as quickly as we possibly can, including the languages bug, this one, and the crashes. We hope to have that out to you guys as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Just to point out the fullbright thing IS actually an issue across a lot of Source games, which Valve haven’t solved either. But we will do our damn best.</p>

<p>Yeah I solved the issue a few hours back actually. Turns out the problem was exactly the integrated graphics thing. I had to open up my NVIDIA settings to force it to use my graphics card with Black Mesa. After that, my system finally got the idea of what to do.</p>

            <p>Here’s my config.cfg file as it is right now (I had a final exam earlier today, so this reflects the state of BM immediately after I quit it last time. I haven’t fired it up again yet.)</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14565853/bms/config.cfg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14565853/bms/config.cfg</a></p>
<p>EDIT: I started BM again and found fullbright mode, even though the settings said that HDR was set to Full. mat_hdr_level was 1, so I set it to 2 and restarted. That fixed the fullbright issue, but as soon as I started a multiplayer game, the fullbright mode got bumped back to 0. I couldn’t change fullbright again without disconnecting, so it looks like fullbright is permanently on when I’m in multiplayer… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

            <p>Yeah, occasionally the game will bump the HDR level back to 0, and force me to have to set it back to 2. This happens especially when I try to alter video settings, even when the settings are unrelated to HDR level.</p>

            <p>DX level was always 9, and mat_fullbright didn’t help.</p>
<p>What did eventually help was setting the HDR level to 2, and then restarting the game, though for some reason it took several restarts to get the changes to stick.</p>
<p>Are none of the maps compiled with LDR lighting?</p>

            <p>Check you have mat_hdr_level set to 2, and make sure you are running DirectX 9 (adding +mat_dxlevel 90 to the games startup). That will fix fullbright. And also set mat_fullbright 0</p>

As title says. Not just the first background map… the entire game is stuck.</p>
<p>mat_fullbright does not help.</p>
