            <p>I really liked the first hour. Racing around in the cart was sill fun. After that? Pure gargly diarrhea.</p>
<p>They made every design error in the book. There are a quick time event to open doors. Think about how amazingly stupid that is, then consider that it isn’t even in the top ten worst things about this game. Bad AI. Bad level design. Bad puzzles. Bad humor. Etc.</p>
<p>I didn’t mind the graphics though, the Quake 4/Prey look kind of worked for it. I was amazed to find out that it was made on Unreal rather than idTech 4.</p>

            <p>Doesnt change the fact that when Black Mesa comes out some people will say it´s shit, haters gonna hate, trolls gonna troll, it´s just how it is :S.</p>
<p>On the DNF thing…</p>
<p>…it´s ok I guess, truth is, if it didnt have the duke name, it provably would´ve sold better as a generic shooter, but because its duke, loads of reviews where bound to come out and because its been so long in dev, and didnt live to expectations, they put it down like a really bad generic shooter, which I don´t think it is. I played it for a few hours, then played something else and didnt go back to it, then formatted, didnt keep the save, and dont feel like starting it again</p>

            <p>It’s very interesting. Apparently the PC version is the best so I got that one. It’s not bad. I mean it’s not the greatest game ever but you can tell it’s a Duke Nukem game. Or at least close enough. I wish you didn’t have a regenerative health bar and two weapon limit but eh, I can live with it so long as the gameplays good, which it’s okay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Big thing a lot of people overlook is that Duke Nukem Forever is a game that was supposed to be released in 1998. Standards of games since then have changed dramatically, so when i see all these reviews giving Duke a sub par or mediocre rating i just shrug because i know that the game, had it been released in 1998 would have been just as phenomenal as half life was. (maybe not as phenomenal but it still would have gotten a hell of a bunch of 10/10/ 5 star/ 2 thumbs up reviews.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Games like half life are still VERY much enjoyable. Hell, I enjoy few splotches of quake or painkiller, and have ton of fun.</p>
<p>Duke nukem forever? … ehhhhh</p>

<p>Big thing a lot of people overlook is that Duke Nukem Forever is a game that was supposed to be released in 1998. Standards of games since then have changed dramatically, so when i see all these reviews giving Duke a sub par or mediocre rating i just shrug because i know that the game, had it been released in 1998 would have been just as phenomenal as half life was. (maybe not as phenomenal but it still would have gotten a hell of a bunch of 10/10/ 5 star/ 2 thumbs up reviews.)</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s not 1998, you can’t say a game would be amazing if it was released 13 years ago so don’t hate on it, it wasn’t released in 1998, it was released in 2011, and it sucked ass.</p>

            <p>Right, and it hasn’t changed at all since 1998, so your argument is completely valid.</p>

            <p>I’m playing it right now and surprisingly, contrary to press reviews, the game is quite enjoyable. The graphics aren’t as bad as people say. Of course, it isn’t Crysis 2 or BF3 but your eyes won’t bleed. What is the most important - the game is fun. Some parts more, some parts less. 2 weapons limit can be easily changed to 4 weapons limit (has anybody ever looked into game options?). What is most important about fps games - shooting is really fun. Your weapons have a feel of being powerful. The game overall has a feel that developers spent too much time working on details as microwaves, toilets and other fun but pointless stuff, which could have been spent on some bigger things. For me it’s about 7/7+ out of 10. I wouldn’t suggest this game to anybody who is much into ‘modern shooter genre’, but if you liked Duke Nukem 3d you’ll probably like dnf too.

            <p>Wasn’t as bad as the magazines called it. They needed to call it a piece of shit, cause a game with such a long development time can’t be good at the end.</p>
<p>Also, wrong forum section.</p>

            <p>I heard they will remove the two weapon system, but thats also sucks that bosses can be injured only by explosives. I’ve given up the game on that damn dam boss. In a duke game thats senseless and boring. The graphics are indeed too old. DNF failed.</p>
<p>I wonder whats the deal with the duke 3d  remake on the other hand.</p>
