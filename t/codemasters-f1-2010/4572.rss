            <p>I will admit I just did Suzuka on my championship, and the sky was too saturated. I’ll stick with it tho, the next version should be more refined.</p>

<p>EDITEDIT:</p>
<p>I got my wheel all set up. There’s a few odd things about using one, but if these are ironed out in the next patch, then It’ll be mint.</p>
<p>Firstly, input lag. It could be worse, but it’s pretty significant. Secondly, it has a strange case of speed sensitive steering. I tried a whole range of degrees rotation on my wheel, and it just wouldn’t want to turn uniformly. It had a case of speed sensitive steering (less sensitive in the middle) that you couldn’t get rid of. Even when I did the typical thing of matching the irl wheel rotation to the games rotation, it just quickened on either side. Real F1 is not like this… is it? It made judging circuits like Monaco a bitch; You’d judge the corner, turn in, and it’d veer sharply nearing full lock, and you’d clip the inside barrier. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Combine that with the input lag, and you’ve got something that kinda ruins the experience. Especially as the force feedback itself is actually pretty good. I can’t imagine anyone using the forcestrength/wheelweight sliders on anything over 50%, I had mine on 30% and 50% respectively and the bigger curbs were giving the wheel huge, godaawful jolts, steering as heavy as you’re likely to get in an F1 car. ffb lacked detail in oversteer and understeer, but conveyed track undulations pretty well.<br>

            <p>I dunno, Monza looked pretty dark for me on the telly.<br>
Although you may be right in that last pic.</p>
<p>But I was reffering to this one:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0OfX022d2s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0OfX022d2s</a><br>
look at the grass in Melbourne. Nasty as fuck.</p>
<p>P.S. Looks fine for me, pretty close to telly footage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmp0z8J1aUk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmp0z8J1aUk</a></p>
<p>P.S.S. To me, those saturation mods are fucking up a lot of contrast, which is unacceptable for me</p>

            <p>‘Better’ lighting effects maybe, but the pallete F1 2010 uses is really badly off. shades of grey and brown are still there, even if they are less powerful than in the likes of DiRT and GRID.</p>
<p>This is a clear sunny day at monza, in vanilla F1 2010;</p>

^Look at that sky, and tell me that’s right. Pretty damn grey for a clear sunny day.</p>

<p>Yes, the OP and the video is giant fail.<br>
It has been already discussed to death on codies’ forums.</p>
<p>Also, new lighting mod is ghey. It made the game look like fucking rfactor. Realistic my ass.</p>

<p>Not even released a week and there are already mods for more realistic lighting, new cameras, helmets, a texture editing program released, car skins…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>I bought the game now, and honestly, I don’t care, that the Qualifying times are faked.</p>
<p>I’m so used to that from the previous F1 game I played (F1 98 on N64  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ) that I don’t really mind it.<br>
The interesting thing is the race, and there it is confirmed that the times are not faked.</p>
<p>The AI seems to do quite good, even though I edited them a bit to make the race a little more entertaining :3</p>

<p>You have to choose your tyre strategy either before the race in tyre menu, or you can make the call using d-pad (or 1/2/3/4 on the keyboard) and then choose the tyres from the list, changing strategy on the fly.</p>

<li>
<p>Major glitches - only one, and it is easily worked around. After you finish an R&amp;D mission in practice (when you are offered it, obviously), the game may create a corrupt save file. A workaround is NOT QUITtING back to paddock right after practice, take time to go into qualifying and than you can safely quit if you want to.<br>
Also, there is a patch to be released soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depends on the AI difficulty setting. Higher the level, less mistakes which are not caused by you. You can always force them to make a mistake by sitting on their tail or defnding from them. It is harder on higher difficulty, obviously.<br>
Qualifying times are said to be rigged but I did not notice it since drivers post their times right when their cars cross the line. You still can disrupt their time by blocking on the track and you still have to beat their set lap time, so it is negligible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.Haven’t tried it online and don’t plan it yet. But in F1, they penalize and DSQ you for crashing. You can tweak the setting of your game to your liking. Also, I know that all the cars are equalized in MP for obvious reasons.</p>

            <p>I’ve played one full race so far, using keyboards (I don’t own a proper controller as this is the first proper racer I’ve played). Even on beginner settings it’s enough of a challenge to keep it interesting. I went from 24th on the grid to 20th. I too found collisions a bit too lenient but it didn’t break the atmosphere too much. Can’t wait to race in wet weather though I can’t imagine I’m going to do that well.</p>

<p>It cannot really be true. I know the devs stated that, but I tried blocking Massa, and it affected his time.<br>
Also, the time are being posted right when the car crosses the line.  So what if they are faked. There’s still traffic factor which can still impede your flying lap. This is the whole point of other cars on track.</p>
<p>There are glithces with timing in the game, yes. But ignorance is bliss. They do not affect the gameplay and do not take away the challenge. In the race, all times except supposedly first lap are correct.<br>
I did not notice or give a fuck really until some douchebag started whinging.</p>

<p>That sounds like a shame :\ Perhaps they will fix it later, or perhaps we’ll just forgive them due to the awesome game they’ve made. If this is a preview of what is to come in future years… <em>drool</em></p>

            <p>Okay, I did it! Finished 7th from 17th on the grid in Albert Park!<br>
My teammate was 6th from 22nd - a fucking puncture forced me to let him pass in the last two laps.<br>
The turning point was when the rain stopped and people started to pit for inters, but I decided to stick to wets till the last moment and it WORKED. Not sure how though, my tyres should have overheated way to much… or maybe not, it was still reasonably moist.</p>
<p>It’s interesting how after I survived the wet phase, I started to lap on the options like a machine! All on a keyboard! It  looks like I got used to the track more during the rain than during  practice and quali. Didn’t beat my quali time tho, probably because of  the fuel load. Plus I suspect that I was not pushing too hard, it seemed to me like I inherited my  wet pace in regard of my braking points and entry/exit.</p>
<p>Wow, I never thought I would play a vidya gaem with SUCH attention to detail. Has to be long race weekends with full time races though. If you cannot bear 2 hours of straight racing, then it’s not for you perhaps.</p>
<p>One problem though, I suspect that about 6 or 7 drivers were stuck in pits because of some bug. Two Mclarens were amongst them. They all were labeled DNF. Hence why I finished that high.<br>
I’m not 100% sure it’s a bug though. Could be mechanical problems for those cars.<br>
But I’ve seen their pitcrews out doing nothing every time I pitted.</p>
<p>Strange</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Got my second qualifying, in Melbourne. Wow.<br>
Even though I play with a keyboard, even with intermediate AI, even with ABS and ESP on - it’s still all about learning the track, finding your breaking point, your entry and exit in the corners. Now I really know what these guys mean when the say they are pushing hard. I’ve spent all the session trying to brake later, to get back on the throttle earlier, kissing the apexes on the verge of cutting the corners, trying not to lift off (which is much harder on the keyboard) in some of the corners just on the edge of getting on the gravel and spinning.<br>
Add some key factors into the mix, like tyre type/temperature/wear, brake temperature, track temperature (it got warmer and sunnier with the time in Australia)/rubbering in, downforce setups - and you end up with an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>I was amazed when in practice, I couldn’t get quicker than 1: 35:9, but in Q1 hit 1: 34:6 and went into Q2, where I failed to improve - I had pipped my first sector in the closing lap, but I spun out twice in the second and third sectors and had to settle with 17th on the grid, which was two places below the team objective. Well shit, have to finish above 12 in the race.</p>
<p>Speaking about practice sessions - those are really valuable. You get to learn the track thoroughly, find your braking and throttle points, experiment with downforce set-ups, fuel load and tyres, changing front wing angle on the fly for the different sectors, trying to find your rhytm around the track.<br>
I’ve spent all my P1 to find my qualifying pace. First tryed the ultra low downforce package, hit the plateau fast, went into lower downforce territory and find out that my best bet is option tyres with extreme “dry” low downforce package.</p>
<p>Same way I tried to find a compromise between setups for different fuel loads in p2 and P3. Felt very different to qualifying setups, it was like driving another car.</p>
<p>Then, after qualifying, loaded into race and then<br>
SUDDENLY SHOWER<br>
Completely caught me out by surprise (well I should of expect rain in Melbourne). LOTS of aquaplaning, both you and your opponents spinning out, can’t see shit because of the spray, AWESOME.</p>

<p>Had to quit but can’t fucking wait to return back to it. Full time 100% true-to-reality races are the shit.<br>
Nevermind the game looking awesome in the rain, and the screens you see are not maxed out (well full details, no AA and aniso).</p>
<p>All in all, this game is must buy for ANYONE a little bit interested in racing. The game itself throws you a lot of challenges and is very competitive by it’s nature. Hell, it made me return to my long forgotten dream of racing open wheelers, which is think would probably be too late now, but fuck, why not give IRL racing a shot!</p>
<p>I can even forgive the shitty damage model now.<br>
11/10<br>
Awesome, brilliant, marvelous, fabulous, amazing and a CRAPLOAD of fun factor.</p>
<p>So, anyone else had their hands on the game yet?</p>

            <p>Had a go… with the keyboard. Because forgetting controller at home is so fun…<br>
Surprisingly playable, with ABS and ESP on, obviously. It even adds to the thrills. The problem is that you cannot post a decent enough time to compete with legendary AI setting, despite the driving aids. Had to settle for intermediate AI level. Qualified 17 in Bahrain on a Virgin. But then I couldn’t get a good enough start, can’t seem to get the gear ratios right. Need to tinker more.</p>
<p>Full time races are really exhilirating. Laps seem to take eternity to complete, those guys are always on your tail, you can’t afford to make a mistake or they are going to pass you. First time, I thought I’ve done at least 1/4 of the race distance, when in reality I was on lap 4/49.<br>
AI on intermediate, while being quite forgiving, provides a lot of fun moments. And is still true to life regarding car specs. For example, if you outbreak a faster car, which is rather a cakewalk provided that you are close enough and you drive the way it would be penalized IRL, you can keep that guy behind, but get ready for extreme pressure from him. If you set a short race distance, it is okay, but when you are doing a full race - sooner or later you are going to make a mistake and he will easily pass you, or you will get a drive-through if you try to defend too erraticly.</p>
<p>Also, being a backmarker is a bitch. You are defending against the other guy, when Button comes from behind and you are getting blue flagged - either let him pass or be disqualified. If you are <span class="bbcode-i">just </span>a bit too slow when letting him through, the guy you are defending from is going to have a huge window of opportunity.</p>
<p>So yeah, F1 2010 is awesome. Absolutely magnificent challenge if you decide to go Full-time season. One thing I don’t like is that the cars, especially in the case of the back end of yours, are too damn sturdy. And you won’t get penalized unless you take someone out. This sorta encourages slight punts against your opponents, which I don’t really like.</p>
<p>P.S. One more little but frustrating problem - if, for example, you make mistake on the braking and in order to avoid a collision you go off the track on the inside, thus cutting the corner AND passing the guy in front - you get instantly penalized, because apparently stewards don’t give a flying fuck if I intend to play fair and wanna let him re-pass.<br>
Can get extremely frustraiting, especially if you don’t have any flashbacks on your disposal.</p>
