    <description>I&#39;m looking for tutorials that explain how to create a basic banner rotator that uses XML to load external .SWF files (much like this [url]https://activeden.net/item/ultimate-rotating-banner-xml/8482[/url] (but obviously something for me to create myself, not just buy and be done with it)).

Right now I created one of my own, but it&#39;s just 1 SWF file with an MC that holds 3 other MCs (and I just swap those 3 MCs when I &quot;update&quot; the banner). But obviously, this is quite an annoying way to do it.</description>
