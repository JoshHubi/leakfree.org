    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/apprehension-all-stuck-posts-collection/9760</link>
    <description>I just got the crossbow and am almost out of the ichthyosaur area I believe. However there&#39;s a sparking wire going off on the only gap in the steel fence I can find. I just can&#39;t seem to figure out a way past it or how to turn it off. Any help would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>Try to stick around closed places where they can only come from one direction, and shotgun 'em. Works best if you can convince them to attempt to “escape” to a dead-end zone. Works like wonder. Stay far away from open places with lots of escape routes.</p>
<p>(Note: I am playing on Hard, and I fount them easy, as long as I used my shotgun in tight places and never waited for them in large rooms)</p>

            <p>I waited by the dead guard until one came towards me, then I blasted her with the shotgun.  I then ran around the corner and went into an area where I could close the door on one side and set up trip mines and also explosive barrels.  Love having a wall at your back.</p>

            <p>TBH I had no trouble at all with the crossbow - there´s this corridor before you enter the hangar, standing in the middle of the corridor facing the door out, I zoomed in and pulled the trigger as soon as I saw something flickering, got 2 of them in a few minutes, I had to run out to lure the third, ran back to corridor, waited, bam - I know, cheap shot  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Has the bridge already moved?, for me it just moved once and that was enough to get to the other side, I used a crouch jump and had to run, it is not an easy jump, mind you.</p>
<p>Also I read somewhere else that the put a box on the edge and that helped them, I didn’t tried that so I don’t know if this works.</p>

            <p>Yeah, this one got me too. You’re looking in the immediate area and the rooms around for red barrels to place in the cage underneath the broken bridge thingy. Once you have enough (I think there’s three to find), it’ll raise the broken platform enough for you to jump across.</p>

            <p>I got stuck at apprehension. After bulding the bridge with air barrels I passed to the other side and the place suddenly collapsed. Now I’m in water again. There are stairs but I can’t reach them. There is a second level up but I can’t reach that either. There are crack in the wall that I can’t get through but I can see the tram on the other side so I’m in the room next door I think. There is an under water passage but a truck blocks that one. I hope you understood where I am. How do I get out of here? I tried to hoard flooting items to try to reach somewhere but nothing…</p>
