    <title>Why Black Mesa doesn&#39;t support Mac/Linux Platforms</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-black-mesa-doesnt-support-mac-linux-platforms/11682</link>
    <description>Before I start, [b]this isn&#39;t a complaint thread[/b].  I created this thread to clear up confusion as to why the devs can&#39;t and won&#39;t port BM to Mac/Linux.

I have seen many complaints, especially around the &quot;Ask the devs&quot; threads, about the inability to play Black Mesa on a Mac/Linux Computer.    I am here to clear up the confusion as to why this is.  So, without further ado, let&#39;s start:

Let&#39;s start with the basics.  The first thing that you should know is what the Source Engine is.  In case you don&#39;t know, the [b]Source Engine[/b] is Valve&#39;s video game engine - meaning, it is what powers the core of the game: from drawing shapes/polygons onto the screen, to developer tools, to AI, to code handling, the list goes on.  The Source engine is one of the things that truly makes BM truly special: it really &quot;feels&quot; like a Valve game.

The [b]Source SDK[/b] is what developers can use to make [i]modifications[/i], or mods, to a game.  Black Mesa, obviously is a mod.  This means that Black Mesa is literally a modified version of Episode 2&#39;s game code (this is explained below).  Alternatively, the Source SDK can be used to create levels for existing games/mods with the [url=&#39;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Hammer&#39;]Hammer Level Editor[/url], create choreography with the [url=&#39;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Face_Poser&#39;]Face Poser[/url], and pretty much anything else besides actual game coding, which is done with Microsoft&#39;s Visual Basic.

There are 3 different types of the source engine that are used in the modding world.  The first is [b]Source Engine 2006.[/b]  This is the first engine used by Valve.  Source Engine 2006 powered everything that Valve made, from Half Life 2 to EP1.  One thing to note about Source 2006 is that Valve has released the core code of Source 2006 to the public - meaning that if someone wants to make a mod of the Source SDK, they literally have Episode 1&#39;s core game code to work off of.  Many popular mods were started by downloading this [b]Source SDK Base 2006[/b] (sound familiar, eh?  :wink: ).  Also note that SDK2006 [u]only supports Windows, NOT Macs/Linux systems[/u].

The second version of Source that was released was Source 2007.  [b]This is the version that Black Mesa Uses.[/b]  Source 2007 is commonly referred to as the &quot;Orange Box&quot; Version, because Source 2007 code is shared between the different Orange Box games (EP2, TF2, Portal 1).  [b]When you download &quot;Source SDK Base 2007&quot; with Black Mesa, you download the core of Source 2007.[/b]  Also note, [b][i][u]Source 2007 doesn&#39;t support Mac/Linux Either.  This is why Black Mesa doesn&#39;t support Macs or Linux Systems.[/u][/i][/b]

Oh yeah, and there was a special SDK released for Alien Swarm, but nobody really uses/cares about it...

But wait, isn&#39;t there a third version of Source available?  Yes there is.  It is called Source 2009.  The entire point of Source 2009 was [i]Mac support[/i].  However, you may notice that there is no &quot;Source SDK Base 2009&quot; available on Steam.  This is because [u]Valve only releases Source 2009 to trusted developers[/u].  I honestly have no idea why, but that&#39;s just how it goes.  Garry&#39;s Mod uses SDK 2009, as well as many other extremely successful, popular mods.  This is why they can be played on Macs.  The BM team could very well get access to Source 2009, but even if they do, it is still a HUGE pain in the ass to port SDK versions.  I believe it took Garry a LONG time to port GMod from SDK 2007 to 2009, and he does it full time.

Also note that there are more recent versions of Source, which power Portal 2, Dota 2, CS: GO, and (possibly) HL3.  None of these engines have been released.

So, I hope this admittedly long thread helped you understand what Source, Source SDK, and all of these big words mean, and by extension, why BM for Mac won&#39;t happen in the foreseeable future.  Thanks for reading!

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]EDIT: [b]Valve has released the Source 2013 code to developers.[/b]  This means that the BM team now at least has the [i]ability[/i] to port to linux/mac.  Whether or not they will actually do so relains to be seen.  You can find this code here: [url]https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013[/url]

<p>Are you talking about the BM team or Valve?  The BM team specifically hired (for lack of a better word) a linux dev, and linux/mac are relatively similar platforms.  Valve has already released all non-proprietary code of the Source engine for all 3 platforms ( <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013</a> )</p>

<p>BM is in the process of being ported (or already has been ported) to Source 2013.  This means that mac/linux support definitely is possible in the next release.  It will have to be recompiled, but from what I know of working with Source it shouldn’t be terribly difficult.</p>

<p>There is a lot of confusion in this post. Source 2007 does <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> support Mac or Linux. Source 2013 however <span class="bbcode-b">does</span>. We have ported the game to Source 2013 for Windows. We will be putting our code up on github for the <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">next release</span></span> to allow people to port our game to the platforms they wish. We have a lot on our plate to contend with so it’s doubtful we’ll have time to do a Mac/Linux port ourselves.</p>

<p>I know that BMS dev team does not like to be pushed, but when you say “next release”, do you mean the release of the 2nd part of BMS, including Xen, or there is any other release planned before that? Note that my question is about what, not about when.</p>

<p>Basically, a few weeks ago I was looking at the tools list in Steam on my Mac and I saw the Source SDK Base 2007 in the list and got really excited for a few minutes. Then I noticed that it said “not available” instead of “not installed.” Apparently I later somehow forgot seeing that it actually wasn’t available and mistakenly got it into my head that it was. My mistake. However, I’m curious about what you said. What does porting the game to the new version of Source change? Better graphics, textures, etc? Essentially a refreshed version? Or just better compatibility and such?</p>

<p>The Source 2013 engine (aka the TF2 engine) is much more stable, has VR support and of course, allows Mac/Linux support. It also gets more love from VALVe than Source 2007 which means if there is some fatal engine bug in the game that causes crashing, chances are VALVe will fix it since they are actively updating it.</p>

            <p>SDK base 2007 might not support Mac, but base 2007 games work fine. I installed Black Mesa into a Wineskin wrapper on my Mac, which basically just makes Black Mesa think it’s being run on windows, and it worked marvelously. It crashed if I ramped up the graphics too high, but I could at least play the game with a not atrocious framerate.</p>

<p>Alright then. My personal recommendation would be to take the code, import it into KDevelop (a Visual Studio-esque IDE for Linux) and repeatedly remove parts that are not Standard C++ or incompatible with Linux until it builds properly. That’d probably be the best for those that are not Linux-programming gurus.</p>
<p>I can’t give any advice on the Mac port - sorry &gt;.&lt;</p>
