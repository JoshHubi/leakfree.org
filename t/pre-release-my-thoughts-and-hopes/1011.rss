    <title>Pre-release: My thoughts and hopes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pre-release-my-thoughts-and-hopes/1011</link>
    <description>Speaking as a fan, there are some ideas that would make my day about the mod, mainly having to do with sound and voice-recording.

[b]*NOTE:[/b] I know that the mod is probably almost finished by now, and these are just my opinions. I am not pleading with you to go back to basics just to make all this happen

[b]1.[/b] In the &quot;Elevator-Crash&quot; scene during Unforeseen Consequences, could one of the scientists shout the Wilhelm Scream?
[b]2.[/b] We now know that the black scientist during Unforeseen Consequences is Eli Vance. Could the voice over artist attempt to sound like a younger Eli Vance? (And maybe the wounded scientist next to him could sound like a younger Kleiner?)

That&#39;s all for requests as of now. However, I have a few pre-release thoughts.

[b]1.[/b] In the original Half-Life, I was a tad disappointed by the HECU models. The Gasmask soldier seems to be the only one suited to handle [i]Hazardous Environments[/i]. I would at least consider thicker armour, or something along those lines. But let me assure you, the new models, particularly the Beret model, are lifelike and beautiful.
[b]2.[/b] Also along the lines of the HECU, the Marines were originally to be seen smoking. This was cut from Half-Life but brought back in the Gearbox expansions.
[b]3.[/b] Will you go along the lines of Opposing Force, and acknowledge that the Black Ops come in male and female models, and are [i]against[/i] the HECU, or will you just use the same lone female approach?
[b]4.[/b] The Houndeyes were originally to be neutral or even friendly to the player, so says Half-Life: Raising the Bar. Could this be brought back for Black Mesa? This could work via letting them follow you unless they are shot (like the Barneys) or if another Houndeye is shot.
[b]5.[/b] Most intriguing to me is that you have a Security Guard Zombie model. There has even been talk of it working like the Zombine of HL2. Along with my thoughts about the under-equipped look of the HECU originally, why not have the &quot;Zombine&quot; characters be the Marines? It seems a lot more likely, seeing as how the security guards have bullet-resistant glass half-a-foot in front of their face. But, if a headcrab can penetrate a Combine Faceplate, I guess they wouldn&#39;t have a problem with Plexiglass.

That&#39;s all for now, and I would appreciate feedback.

Regards,
  J. Bradley</description>

That face creator is a fucking PC games revolution and should be in every 3D game to come.

<p>Sadly, you seem to be right. As for the animator, you think there’d be potential for the system to be licensed to other game engines? If that were a possibility, we’re looking at the future  of in-game NPCs. I doubt it would take long for the system to be remade for the Unreal engine/cryEngine 4. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
