    <title>2K Give away. Illegal?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/2k-give-away-illegal/6901</link>
    <description>Ok. I may not be an expert on things like this but im pretty sure the rules to be eligible to win the 2k give away makes it a lottery.

[img]https://img28.imageshack.us/img28/9578/newbitmapimageat.png[/img]

Apparently, You have to BUY something from todays sale to be eligible.  In other words, you have to spend legal tender to be entered in a drawing (Lottery)

Can someone tell how this ISN&#39;T an illegal lottery?

P.S.

Before someone says &quot;Company&#39;s do it all the time!  Look at G-Gurt and such company&#39;s! They do this all the time!.&quot;

because no they don&#39;t you don&#39;t have to buy something from them to be eligible, note the NO PURCHASE NECESSARY rule, which the 2K give away DOESN&#39;T have.</description>

<p>Which is why ur state lottery makes you pay for it.  When the hell did i say state lottery tickets were free.  I said Company’s and Organisations that have give aways have to make it free to enter.  I never said ur state lottery gives free tickets.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Oh by the way. Why is it when ever someone try’s to ask a question on this forum every response has to be a dick answer.  Seriously, go outside and get some social skills for once.  For some reason everybody in the BMS forum has this impression that if your’re a dick to everyone, you’re cool.</p>

<p>I was under the impression lottery tickets were never being given out for free.</p>
<p>Then again, I’ve never bought any so I guess maybe you just need to ask politely.</p>

            <p>Mm. I got it.  You dont have to purchase anything directly.  You could send the note car to them but they would say “Sorry, oyu dont have one of the games that is on sale. you cant be entered”</p>
<p>But due to technicality this isnt illegal.</p>
<p>Because they say you must OWN doesn’t mean you have to BUY. Which is ALMOST impossible to do other than gifting.</p>

<p>It means if you have already bought the game of the day before, then you’re already eligible for this.</p>
<p>No way Valve would allow this if it was illegal.</p>

            <p>Ok. I may not be an expert on things like this but im pretty sure the rules to be eligible to win the 2k give away makes it a lottery.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Apparently, You have to BUY something from todays sale to be eligible.  In other words, you have to spend legal tender to be entered in a drawing (Lottery)</p>
<p>Can someone tell how this ISN’T an illegal lottery?</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>Before someone says “Company’s do it all the time!  Look at G-Gurt and such company’s! They do this all the time!.”</p>
<p>because no they don’t you don’t have to buy something from them to be eligible, note the NO PURCHASE NECESSARY rule, which the 2K give away DOESN’T have.</p>
