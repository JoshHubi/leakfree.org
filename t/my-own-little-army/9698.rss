            <p>I was actually able to get a third scientist on top of those four security guards. In the part where the two scientists were pulled into the air vent and killed by some monster, you could save one of the scientists by killing the other one (this is a bug). However this caused my security guards to open fire on me. It might be possible to leave the guards waiting some distance away so that they do not see this happening.</p>

            <p>I used to do the exact same thing in Half-Life 1, except that you could only order 2 or 3 NPCs at the same time before one would automatically stop following you, so I had to bring them all in shifts. And then I got to climbing the elevator shaft and I just had to leave them all behind. At least in Black Mesa they have some dialogue, where one scientist says he can’t make the jump and one security guard says he guesses he’ll stay on babysitting duty. The others don’t say anything, but if you speak to the female scientist she’ll warn you not to talk the public when you get topside or there could be a media circus.</p>
<p>Anyway, felt good, it seemed like this group could defend themselves and protect each other so bringing them all together had helped them out.</p>

            <p>I just love the fact that you can have friends with you!<br>
It feels fantastic, like a movie.</p>
<p>And they also talk, comment, tell me to reload my weapon and etc  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Too bad that there are places where they can’t follow you further. It would be good if it was possible to maintain them with you if you’re careful. I don’t like being alone  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
