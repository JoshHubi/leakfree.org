            <p>man, this…this game and everything that went with it…it’s just so unfortunate. I only got to know about the game when I saw a playthrough of the techdemo a few month back (btw none of the content of the techdemo is in the actual game, right?)</p>
<p>This game is just not worth looking at. And yet I keep watching Reviews that tear the game apart. It’s a bit like a car accident. It makes you uncomfirtable to watch, and yet you cannot look away. In this case however, It’s like somebody tries to sell the car accident for a brand new car and charges a good amount of money!</p>
<p>This is all very bad enough and I think it should just be ignored. I do get the anger about it, as it is sold as a proper game within the HL universe. This is damn cheeky. And the communication of the devs with the public is…just not helping. At all. And the bad reviews it gets on steam should actually be enough to keep people away from this game. But looking at the steam forums of this game it’s becoming clear that apart from the well deserved critical comments, more and more rubberneckers are attracted to the accident…erm I mean the the game forums and it’s not helping things either.</p>
<p>It’s just sad. This game, and the slaughterfest that comes with it.[/size]</p>
