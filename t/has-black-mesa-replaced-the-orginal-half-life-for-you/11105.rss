    <description>Just thought I&#39;d revive this now that it&#39;s out.

For me of course nothing can replace Half Life, but I think in terms of story it definitely has. If I&#39;m replaying the whole series I&#39;ll probably play Black Mesa, but I&#39;ll still play Half Life for old times sake.</description>

            <p>I feel BM and HL1 are different enough that I can enjoy both of them in the near and far future. Even if I were looking for a replacement I feel BM falls short of BM in a few areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The game just feels a lot more like a quicksave/quickload grind during the soldier part of the game as well as many of the jumping bits. I like the game despite this but my patience often approaches the limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sound effects. The pathetic explosion sounds and tentacle head-smashing sounds completely kill the mood of firefights and the tentacle bit in Blast Pit, respectively. This could be easily fixed with modding BM but I’m no sound engineer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visibility is a lot poorer than in HL1. I’m having a really, really hard time in Surface Tension due to this. I simply can not see the tiny, thin, yellow crosshair in the bright deserts well enough to be running and gunning. I find myself running like hell to lure soldiers to a long ass valley where I can take my time to aim with the pistol while they are running towards me from an extreme distance (yeah and of course they are aware of the fact they have infinite ammo and spray at me from a mile away.).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The good stuff is very, very good but there are little things here and there that make HL1 imch forward in my book.</p>

<p>Isn’t that part of Half-Life’s appeal?  You’re not supposed to feel like you’re in normal, everyday, happy life - you’re supposed to feel like you’re in a devastated facility with very few survivors, with survival and escape as your main priorities.  I always felt like one of Half-Life 2’s main weaknesses was that the world didn’t feel empty enough.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think they mean more in core scenery.  Black Mesa really makes the facility feel like a place that was once somewhere people worked - every room seems to have a purpose, and is filled with little details that make it a believable world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the original Half-Life has lots of seemingly pointless areas/empty rooms and really sparse scenery detail.  Obviously it’s just an artifact of the time, back then we filled in the bad graphics with our imaginations, but going back now is a little awkward.</p>

            <p>I’ll always love HL, but I don’t think I’ll be spending much time with Goldsource from now on, except to play the few HL mods still in development. Black Mesa will replace it in my series runthroughs once Xen is released.</p>

            <p>Not yet. If with the Xen update there will be bugs and AI fixed, added few missing parts and tweaked the game mechanics a bit (IE mp5): maybe.</p>

            <p>There are several critical moments that are unique to Half-Life, so no.  I do still love Black Mesa, though, and in my personal, purely hypothetical Half-Life reimagining, several moments that it originated are incorporated.</p>

            <p>Completely for me.  Assuming Xen isn’t somehow worse than the original when it releases, I can’t see myself ever playing the original for fun again.</p>
<p>However, I have no nostalgic attachment to the original and having played HL2 first it was always sort of awkward to me.  I really had to force my way through HL1, I just don’t find it that fun at all, and the bland, empty envioronments and unbelieveable characters just feel so archaic compared to HL2, and are really shown up for it more than ever before by Black Mesa.  I appreciate what it did for shooters but I guess you had to be there at the time.</p>
<p>I suppose I’m slightly jealous of those who were “there at the time”, although it seems I’ve been able to appreciate BM Source all the more for it.</p>
<p>Oh, and finally… there are no words for how much I adore the Black Mesa soundtrack.  The original HL soundtrack always sounded so awkward for me, like it wasn’t sure what genre it wanted to be or what emotions/feelings it wanted to put across to the player.  Almost all the tracks that weren’t reused in HL2 just sound so “off” to me.  Meanwhile Black Mesa does the whole “using sad music at times which aren’t really all that sad at all to make them strangely epic and beautiful” which is literally my favourite thing a soundtrack can do.  And of course the rockin’ action scene songs are just amazing too.</p>

            <p>Not really. Though it comes pretty close to replacing the original. It adds a bit more coherency to HL2 than the original did. It also fixed some of the small things in HL1 that didn’t make much sense to me (such as placement of obstacles and such).</p>

            <p>IMO, while they help the narrative to be there, most of them aren’t significant enough gameplay wise to feel like I’m missing something if I don’t go back and play them, except for maybe certain parts of On a Rail.</p>

            <p>For me, yeah it has. I don’t think after playing BM that I can go back to HL. I can still (and am at the moment) play Opposing Force and Blue Shift until their remakes are out, but Black Mesa is bascially 2012 Half Life, so to me I might as well play that now on.</p>

            <p>I have never thought Half-Life felt more clunky and dated until I played Black Mesa.<br>
But Half-Life is a classic! It actually is a pretty tough choice for me. Black Mesa is nice and pretty and up to my beloved Source engine… but I’ve been playing Half-Life for around 13 years now, which is a gigantic portion of my life.<br>
I’ll have to say they’re about equal to me. Black Mesa is Half-Life but <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">NEW</span></span>, how the hell can I pick?</p>

            <p>for me it will replace the original, just because black mesa feels alive, half life, although amazing at the time, now when it’s played I feel like a gerbil going through bland shoe boxes, BMS, like I said, feels alive, and like you are going through an actual facility, and is very believable. although I do miss bunny hopping and wall strafing  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Black Mesa is a fantastic update to Half-Life. Going through the campaign, I felt like I was playing HL for the first time. It’s just so spot on about everything that made the original great, and improving on parts that weren’t. I’d love to see some HL1 mods recreated with BM assets as mods to BM. (Someplace Else in BM? One can dream… =P)</p>

            <p>Hmmm… I suppose it has, though I may still go back and play the original games every now and then. They actually look pretty nice with the right mods and they’re still fun.</p>

            <p>Not even close I would say. The graphics and atmosphere are hugely appealing, but when it comes down to the just playing the game, the gameplay, and the missing elements, I just can’t help it. I miss HL1 immensely while playing Black Mesa.</p>
<p>I think Black Mesa’s take on a few levels is much too inferior to be considered in any way better. The marines are a joke, the Alien Grunts are nowhere near as fun to fight…</p>
<p>There’s just too many things missing. I actually have not felt any real touches on how the game plays. It felt to me, like Black Mesa was made purely for its aesthetics rather than how it plays. Because this is exactly how I would feel about modern AAA games when it comes to that.</p>
<p>Heck, EVERY little change bothers me. Marines not using MP5 grenades, MP5 grenades and rockets being way too fast… Its like, everything was “modernized” with no regards to the gameplay, or even the feeling. I did not have nearly the same feeling as I did in HL1 passed a certain point in the game. The first half is great… the second half is … well… incredibly untrue to the original.</p>
<p>Because of this kind of design, Black Mesa cannot in any way, shape or form, be considered a replacement for Half-Life in my eyes. Black Mesa is nothing to me but a very beautiful ride. But I never played Half-Life for beauty.</p>

            <p>Can I ask, when paople say bugs, do they mean balancing issues, etc.? Because I played the game for 10 hours and all I encountered were two CtDs (I get way more with every other source game I played). Other than that, the game was remarkably free of bugs. No clipping issues, no non-reactive AI, no getting stuck in the level architecture, no nothing. Maybe I am just lucky but I am wondering what kinds of bugs people have. Sure the balancing is harsh at times and the loading times are long due to the very high rez textures but those are features, not bugs  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>

            <p>If you forget about nostalgia for a moment, Black Mesa could be a better game without all the bugs and with Xen. Then maybe the only reason I would play HL1 would be the cut out content from Surface Tension, but on the whole, a polished and complete Black Mesa would replace Half-Life 1 for me.</p>

            <p>For me Black Mesa is especially about technical enhancement such as graphics, sound and AI etc. I love it as a remake because it <span class="bbcode-b">looks</span> awesome, but it won’t replace Half-Life for me because the atmosphere in that game from 1998 is so unique, I doubt that anyone can even remake it in Source. It has something to do with the GoldSource engine, as some others already said, Black Mesa lacks the nostalgic, creepy atmosphere Half-Life has. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing, I’m glad both games exist. That way I can always decide which one I want to play. If I only played Black Mesa from now on I’d soon miss the simple blocky level design (comparing to Source), the diffuse textures, equally looking security guards, scientists walking like robots, and waaay more nostalgic things.</p>
