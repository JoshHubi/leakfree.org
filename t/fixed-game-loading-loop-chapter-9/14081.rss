    <title>[FIXED] Game Loading Loop (chapter 9)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixed-game-loading-loop-chapter-9/14081</link>
    <description>Steam version  and mod version

In Chapter 9 at the part where you enter the Freezer that drains your suit power and health,.
map c2a3b I believe.

Step to reproduce:
Kill the scientist right after he opens the door to the freezer area.
Run into the freezer area as quick as possible
Wait for the game to say you failed and reload because you killed the scientist.
At this point your game will continue to reload you in the freezer area over and over because you killed the scientist.

Here is a video of the part I&#39;m talking about (doesn&#39;t show the loading loop(i can provide a video of the loading loop if required))

[I ended up loading an old save and not killing the scientist to get through the area normally]</description>
