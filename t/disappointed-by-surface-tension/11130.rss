    <title>Disappointed by &quot;Surface Tension&quot;.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/disappointed-by-surface-tension/11130</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been really enjoying Black Mesa up to this point, and I think it&#39;s an incredible accomplishment overall.

That said, I&#39;m somewhat disappointed by Surface Tension for several reasons. 

First of all.. why was the tentacle area removed in the region after the dam? That area was quite memorable in the original game, and it&#39;s a glaring omission in Black Mesa. Also, why are land mines visible? It pretty much defeats the purpose of having them and presents zero challenge. It just seems like that whole area was really watered down.

Second... the booby trapped warehouse is freakin RIDICULOUS!  I must have died around 30 times now, and I&#39;m generally pretty good at jumping puzzles in first-person shooters. I don&#39;t remember it being nearly that difficult in Half-Life. Can someone throw me some tips before I rage quit?

I really hope the devs work on that level a bit more before the final version.</description>

            <p>The only real disappointment for me was the missing end part of surface tension. I don’t know why you guys think that cutting it was a good idea, but I’m glad FAMGUY1 plans on rectifying it. He has my support.</p>

            <p>Completed surface tension and I do miss xenian part, one with bunch of grunts and spawning vorts, witch was supposed to come after dealing with infinite soldier apache and tank and end with entering area with Gargantua. I liked this part a lot on original, because those grunts were fun and interesting to fight with, unlike those triggerhappy soldiers.</p>

            <p>Surface Tension is a great example of the BAD HECU AI.<br>
Especially when in the canals and climbing a ladder, just Gordon’s fart is enough for the whole squad to react faster than an instant and shoot his ponytail.<br>
It’s wallhack+aimbot+guns shoot even before a trigger is pulled  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> , it appears to could of have been possible only if they had an extra pair of eyes in the back of their heads (tracking devices in HEV suit isn’t an excuse good enough)<br>
Another one in this chapter is this:<br>

They magically know about Gordon and shoot right as any body-part of his sticks out just slightly.</p>

<p>Agreed.  During my first playthrough i was able to navigate through this section without saving…and before the music even stopped playing.</p>
<p>IMO, the hardest thing about surface tension (BM in general) is HECU’s reaction time and accuracy.</p>

<p>OK, replayed. In the last stage, in trip mine room, when activating the elevator with the box, there is no need to brake the box. Instead, you can jump down and push the box so that it would not touch the trip mine laser when the elevator goes up. This box may be used to jump into the elevator that goes down.</p>

<p>I don’t understand how some people seems to be having problems with the trip mine room. I seriously didnt even consider that room. I went on jumping and ended up at a lift where a box was located. I accidently blew the room up when I pressed the control for the lift the first time. But then I just turned the lift on and sprinted to crush the box with the crowbar and the section was done. Easy as fuck  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Crouch jumping is essential.</p>

            <p>the lack of invisible mines is going to be a big letdown for me. The tentacles i will be able to live without, but I really did enjoy shooting at the damn things to try to figure out where they all were. having them visible is just going to make me wonder what the point is.</p>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[TextFAMGUY1]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m just going to say here that I’m remaking one of the missing sections of Surface Tension as part of my own little personal project. The level in question which basically got completely omitted from Surface Tension in Black Mesa from the original HL1 was C2A5F, and I feel it was an essential part of the chapter because it featured 3 or 4 occasions where you bear witness to the HECU getting flattened by the Xen Aliens in fights.</p>
<p>About 1/4 of the way through the mission C2A5F in HL1 you reach the scene with the vent shooting, where you drop down into a garage and proceed through the rest of the level. The End of C2A5F leads into C2A5G, which starts in a car park with the Gargantua chase. Black Mesa basically cut off of C2A5F and merged the vent drop with the Garg Chase.</p>
<p>Forget About Freeman in Black Mesa doesn’t strike the same chord as it did in HL1 - it doesn’t make much sense without C2A5F I feel, as it is during that section you realise the HECU are really taking some heavy losses.</p>
<p>I am an experienced Source mapper and I may or may not release my final product to the general community when it’s done. That all depends on how easy it is to get it working with the campaign as is, and how good I feel it is. I have only mapped for CS: Source and GO so this is a learning process for me too. I will have no trouble at all with creating pretty looking geometry, lighting and landscape - my issue will be with the AI and scripted sequences.</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions for things about C2A5F from HL1 which I could change, fire away. I hope that sometime in the future it may be able to fill the void left in Surface Tension by the mapper sadly leaving halfway through.</p>
<p>I have 2 questions for the devs as well, if they happen to be perusing this thread at some point.</p>
<p>Will cut sections from Surface Tension/On A Rail be re-added to Black Mesa in future updates (alongside Xen?/Greenlight update?) If not, I am going to work on them myself just as a little community/personal project. I will anyway, but I’d still like to know.</p>
<p>In Black Mesa, there actually is a tentacle entity in the middle of the first minefield on Surface Tension, near where it is on the original. At least that’s how it is on my decompiled .vmf. Is this a decompile error, or is there something wrong with the versions you shipped with Black Mesa, because there definitely isn’t a tentacle in game. I remember hearing the devs comment they had a program which cut down on file sizes by removing unnecessary entity (this is why vox doesn’t exist in BM), does that have something to do with why the tentacle doesn’t appear?</p>

</aside>
<p>Of course I did. I have watched let’s plays where the player breezes through it like nothing. My jumping skills just suck, and continued to do so after dozens of practice ones. I saved my keyboard, mouse and hair from my rage by noclipping to the elevator.</p>
<p>Though I doubt many people would miss this part of ST if it was radically changed/omitted altogether. The tripmine puzzle is in the top 3 of my list of things HL1/BM could have done without.</p>

<p>Noclip. Going through such pointless frustration is a waste of time and I figured that out pretty quickly when Gordon’s pathetic jumps kept setting off tripmines. Jump regularly and touch the laser, you die, crouch jump and go too slowly so that you touch the laser as you land, you die. I call it pretty good you died only 30 times in that room.</p>
<p>And yeah, it was far easier in HL1, my theory is the jump mechanics have a big say in that.</p>

<p>To be honest I think Surface Tension is mostly well polished, Forget About Freeman needs a lot more work imo.</p>
<p>Another thing  that made Surface Tension frustrating for me was the soldiers. I spent more time quickloading and repeating than making progress because one little mistake against those guys will result in massive health/energy loss. Not to mention they will shoot at me just a tenth of a second after I show up in their line of sight, hell, even if I am crouched behind cover and only release the crouch button for a split moment and fire the gun they still manage to shoot me.</p>

            <p>Alien Grunt smashes a HECU marine through a concrete wall… The Alien Grunts did not really get their slice of the limelight as an enemy and the one behind the blast doors in Lamda core was also omitted… It would be great to see these 2 scenes involving alien grunts re-instated from surface tension and Lambda core</p>

<p>I must say that I like this chapter but at the same time I’m disappointed. In “On A Rail” I did not miss the cut content, but the Tentacle Fight, the ware house fight, the grenade in that pipe and probably more scenes were really memorable moments. If the devs cannot find enough man power, I’d suggest they should release the important source files for that chapter so that the community can recreate the missing moments. They would really enhance the experience in Surface Tension.<br>
Furthermore, I have to agree with you on the mines. They really should be less visible for the player. In Half-Life 1, you had to throw grenades intelligently to kill most mines and then move from explosion decal to explosion decal. But since you could not see the mines, this created a lot of tension. In Black Mesa, you throw some grenades and kill the rest of the mines with the glock. It’s just an annoying shooting exercise. And they are underpowered.<br>
On top of that, Surface Tension has quite a few bugs. For example, the dam has obvious map leaks.</p>

<p>I totally agree. There are many memorable moments lost in this chapter. Surface Tension is my favorite part and I was really disappointed when it was cut.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Lets just hope that the devs have the time and patience to remake it.</p>

            <p>I don’t really care to see the tentacles re-appearing after playing through “Blast Pit” to kill them in such a spectacular manner.<br>
I would definitely be down for a “Surface Tension - Extended Edition” though.<br>
More fights with HECU, HECU vs Alien encounters etc…</p>

            <p>^ Which makes Freeman even more of a badass, in retrospect. Consider how many squads of Marines you’ve single-handedly killed. You’ve shot down an apache, blown up an APC, destroyed TWO M1 Abrams tanks, and you looted a full armory of military grade hardware. For all intents and purposes, the good Doctor is probably the most chilling threat the Marines have faced thus far, and having an alien invasion going on is just another incentive to pull out Occham’s razor and nuke the base.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just played through Surface Tension in Half-Life and I think the biggest problem with the parts that were cut for this mod isn’t so much that they are amazingly fun or memorable, but that they really are a big part of the storyline.</p>
<p>The part with the mounted gun where you have to gun down at least fifteen vortigaunts teleporting in is followed by a room with a HECU body strung up by rebar on the ceiling. You use one of the alien jump pads to get up on a ledge of a severely destroyed building and witness two more HECU being pinned down by a vort and an alien grunt.</p>
<p>After this is the snark section where you drop down from the vent and kill the guys in the garage. You can tell the marines are getting jumpy at this point by them shooting up the vents just from hearing something. Then there’s a few on a cannon that you have to kill and use the cannon to break a hole in the wall where there are two more alien grunts. You get the feeling at this point that the aliens are literally everywhere and the HECU are starting to lose.</p>
<p>The next room is a giant battle between the HECU and alien grunts and a few vortiguants where a tank busts through the wall with marines coming out of it. The HECU loses this battle and after you cleanup the very next hallway has an alien grunt tossing a marine through a concrete wall.</p>
<p>After that you drop down on two marines hiding in a mostly destroyed building from an alien grunt and a few vortigaunts. There’s yet another alien grunt way up on the roof of that building. You use the jump pad to go up and drop inside and go into the pipe that a marine throws a satchel charge into. After killing him the next room is a bunch of HECU running around like crazy trying to avoid multiple headcrabs.</p>
<p>By the way there’s alien terrain scattered throughout the buildings in this chapter. From multiple defunct jump pads to webbing in the corners etc. I like to think of it as the creep from starcraft. The whole area is clearly being taken over by the aliens.</p>
<p>After getting the guard to open the door to the garage area the gargantua completely gibs two marines against a wall by pushing a vehicle into them.</p>
<p>Needless to say the HECU is getting slaughtered at this point. There are a bunch of small numbers of them cut off at every turn by aliens. The entire point of the last half of Surface Tension is to show how badly the HECU are losing at this part of the story. This is why the cut parts of the map are so important as Forget about Freeman is the next chapter.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed. The sequences cut from surface tension need to be reinstated in some shape or form. The removal of all the large scale engagements between the HECU and aliens leaves the narrative disjointed and results in the military withdrawl lacking any kind of credibility.</p>
<p>It’s plainly obvious that many of the engagements witnessed by the player throughout the game were removed, simply because the game is so unbalanced that the marines would win easily, every single time, making there withdrawl even more implausible!</p>
<p>If the release of the final part of the mod is a long way off (and I suspect it is) there is no reason that surface tension couldn’t be reworked simultaneously and retconned into the game with the release of the final part. I seriously doubt anyone is going to complain about having to replay a fully restored Surface Tension!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I mean missing tentacles and visible mines are one thing, but the scripted sequences at the end of surface tension are a fundamental part of the narrative. Without them it appears as if the military is pulling out solely due to the actions of Gordon Freeman.</p>

            <p>I saw the dogfighting haarriers and mantas now in forget about freeman and I think it was done really well but when you first appear it would have been good to show a jet in flames going down followed by a Manta to reinforce that the grunts are losing… Atleast it is an idea only  but basically what they have done is awesome… Just want more,</p>
<p>Surface tension was probably the best level in half life and they did a great job of it… But to add the missing atras on this chapter would just make the MOD that much more awesome… I am sure they have Mappers to work on sections of this now the MOD is almost there.</p>

            <p>I think the way Surface Tension was changed to be freaking huge makes up for that (crappy) bit that was cut out. My only complaint with Surface Tension is of course the dam having nodraw textures applied in a clearly visible spot (it’s like they didn’t even try :O) and the awkward aerial bombing monitor. It worked well but the whole flickery thing was annoying.</p>

            <p>I was a little disappointed with the shortened Surface Tension. But I can see how most of those areas towards the end would be a little bit nonsensical to remake. But then, they could have been re-envisioned or expanded, but understandable that it was because a team member left. I guess nobody else could pick up on it?</p>
<p>What I DID like about it was that the Garg took me COMPLETELY by surprise! I was NOT expecting it so soon and I was absolutely terrified when he appeared.</p>
<p>I never had any problem with the trip mine room either. Did it perfectly (somewhat) first try. That is, I didn’t do anything that I really got frustrated over. I died moreso by testing jumps or ducks in different places. Always had a quick save just before my experiments. I thought it was fine.</p>
<p>I really love how all of Surface Tension just looks BIGGER. And not just the dam section, but everywhere. It looks like a proper facility. Actually, the whole game does.</p>

<p>I don’t understand how some people seems to be having problems with the trip mine room. I seriously didnt even consider that room. I went on jumping and ended up at a lift where a box was located. I accidently blew the room up when I pressed the control for the lift the first time. But then I just turned the lift on and sprinted to crush the box with the crowbar and the section was done.
