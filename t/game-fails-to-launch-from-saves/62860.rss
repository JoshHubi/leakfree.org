    <title>Game fails to launch from saves</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-fails-to-launch-from-saves/62860</link>
    <description>I am in Xen near the end game. I select a save point, the &#39;connecting to server&#39; message appears, begins to load then the game crashes. This occurs every time on 4 different machines, 4 different graphics cards, WIN 7,8 and 10 OS so it isn&#39;t an in-house glitch or the OS. There is no error message, just a black screen then I am back in my Steam library.</description>

            <p>I couldn’t find it. Will continue to play BM through, hoping an update or release of the final version of BM clears it up.</p>

            <p>I wonder if you need to go and do a deep clean and make sure it isnt pulling down info from the cloud. There is a thread somewhere on how to delete the cloud cache…</p>

            <p>Thanks. I did that on 2 of my machines a couple of times. It didn’t change the issue, BM still crashed on launch from load.</p>

            <p>No mods, subscribed to the Black Mesa public beta, no others. The fail is in bm_c4a1a1. The saves in question were created Feb 1,2 ,8 &amp; 9. I went through a save from the ‘start new game’ menu at the beginning of Interloper as well. It ran for a couple of minutes then crashed.</p>
<p>I used 4 different computers. Each has its own different graphics/video card and cpu. 2 run WIN 10, 1 runs WIN 8 and 1 runs WIN 7. The same crash at launch from load occurs on all of them. Each  of the computers has been restarted every time I tried to launch BM from a save on that machine. Thus my conclusion that it is not my machines. All of my other games run quite nicely.</p>
<p>I have not been able to save at will since the Xen launch, all of the saves were when I quit the game session.  I restarted BM this past Saturday from the beginning. Other than not being able to save at will it runs fine. I launched from saves yesterday without a problem or crash so the bug is later in the game.</p>

            <p>Several questions.</p>
<p>Do you have ANY mods or any workshop items?</p>
<p>Are you subscribed to a beta?</p>
<p>When where those saves created?</p>
<p>Restart your computer and see if it works.</p>
