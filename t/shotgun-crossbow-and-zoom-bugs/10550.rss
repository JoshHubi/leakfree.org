    <description>[b]Shotgun &quot;dummy&quot; pump[/b]
If switch from shotgun to another weapon without allowing the pump animation  between shots to complete then when switch back the shotgun pumps before it can be fired.
Similar issue with the crossbow as demonstrated in the demo

[b]Crossbow zoom sensitivity[/b] 
seems way too high (for my liking) I  can adjust it with &quot;zoom_sensitivity_ratio&quot; less than 1.0 but this has the effect of lessening the sensitivity for suit zoom (+zoom and toggle_zoom) meaning while its perfect for crossbow zoom its less than perfec for the others.

[b]toggle_zoom[/b]
Allows us to fire when zoomed in on all weapons not sure if you guys want this behaviour or not.</description>

            <p>I also find it hard to aim with crossbow through scope unlike other HL games.</p>

            <p>I am with you that the sensitivity of crossbow zoom feels wrong.</p>
<p>I didnt’t have a problem with it while playing, but it feels not like it was in any HL game nor any other game.</p>
<p>There was a reason all developers changed the mouse sensitivity for zoomed in weapons for their games.</p>
<p>If it isn’t fixed in patch I will use your solution (thanks a lot, btw, I didn’t find that setting) and live with the lesser evil of too low sens for normal zoom.</p>
