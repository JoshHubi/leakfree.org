    <description>pretty sure this more or less goes here, may fit better in the help and support, but i suspect it will turn into a vote or something.

so after seeing the earlier concepts of the combine soldier i fell in love with this concept.

I&#39;ve asked around a bit, but i would really love to see this modeled and in game as a replacement, i have the resources to learn modeling myself, but for now something this complex is beyond me. so it would be incredibly awesome if some talented and sexy 3ds aficionado could go and make these pics a reality.

it really bugs me how valve managed to leave out some of the really cool concepts, i love valve and their games but looking at the images, i noticed how much more exciting the other combine recolors are and the other ideas pertaining to them.

don&#39;t get wrong, I would whore myself out to gabe if i was given the chance, but i cant help but look fondly at the countless ideas that got passed them.

so yeah, read the book i managed to write here and if someone could model that combine and incorporate it into half life 2 and its episodes that would be awesome. 

PS: i will give you a high-five and a cookie.</description>

            <p>well in theory the face was to make the enemies think that he was looking to another direction while the robotic head was the real one looking there. Also, I have played some maps of the beta the combine guard can’t be killed but moves really slow, aims really slow and takes it’s time to shoot. It’s really easy to above the shoot…</p>

            <p>He’s right that it doesn’t fit with the combine’s aesthetics. If it were the combine’s black metal, I could see it better. Also doesn’t make much sense having the face exposed, a few quick shots should kill it. Also doesn’t make sense that they’d go through all the effort to make a human tank when the alien synths, human soldiers &amp; vehicles seem far more logical.</p>

<p>They could have moved it to the citadel like they did with the gunship bays. The point is that the enemies themselves weren’t any fun.</p>
<p>The Guard was supposed to fire freely with it’s gun, which is the same as the strider cannon. The strider cannon only fires at &amp; from specified points, so scripted environmental damage can occur, including blowing holes in buildings. It also disintegrated props &amp; kills the player instantly. If you’ve played the leak, you know it just amounts to a strider battle where you aim lower, you have less cove, the enemy is much less likely to hit you &amp; if it does, you don’t get a second chance.</p>
<p>They didn’t have the time to make it fun, so it was cut.</p>

            <p>Yes, that’s all crap that was cut from the game for good reason. Thank you for reinforcing his point.</p>

<p>That’s what I think too. People are like that. If something doesn’t make it in the final game, they start drooling all over it just because it isn’t there.<br>
It’s not the first time someone has complained that, some stuff in the beta looks better than the retail game. Is it true? Not to me.</p>

<p>really? I’ve been following that and it mostly looks like their soldiers are reskined to beta form and given different helmets…</p>
<p>nope just checked, im mistaken. i cant really mess around too much with their models, but im sure i can use them for my own greedy and slimy purposes.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>like uhm… posing them on Gmod? Because, srsly, you will not have more places to use them than in that. I mean you can also put them on your original hl2 but not in a mod made by you without permision… Only Gmod seems to be able to do that…</p>

            <p>pretty sure this more or less goes here, may fit better in the help and support, but i suspect it will turn into a vote or something.</p>
<p>so after seeing the earlier concepts of the combine soldier i fell in love with this concept.</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/2/20002faf28adfd94ca98cf6ced46f14334b53684.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="4z5G2IZt5wOwviENunvdlKHFy6w" width="161" height="81"></p>

<p>I’ve asked around a bit, but i would really love to see this modeled and in game as a replacement, i have the resources to learn modeling myself, but for now something this complex is beyond me. so it would be incredibly awesome if some talented and sexy 3ds aficionado could go and make these pics a reality.</p>
<p>it really bugs me how valve managed to leave out some of the really cool concepts, i love valve and their games but looking at the images, i noticed how much more exciting the other combine recolors are and the other ideas pertaining to them.</p>
<p>don’t get wrong, I would whore myself out to gabe if i was given the chance, but i cant help but look fondly at the countless ideas that got passed them.</p>
<p>so yeah, read the book i managed to write here and if someone could model that combine and incorporate it into half life 2 and its episodes that would be awesome.</p>
<p>PS: i will give you a high-five and a cookie.</p>
