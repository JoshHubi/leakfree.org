    <description>Hey folks!
I&#39;m Benjamin Truman, the Story Lead for Black Mesa.

Since graduating from Art Institute of Pittsburgh, where I met many of Black Mesa&#39;s developers (including Project Lead Carlos Montero), I have been writing comics full time.
I&#39;ve been lucky enough to do stories for Conan the Cimmerian &amp; Creepy Magazine, both published by Dark Horse. I was even a part of FUBAR, a world war 2 zombie anthology that debuted on the New York Times Bestsellers list!
Recently, I concluded my proudest work - HAWKEN, a 6 issue mini series published by IDW.

[i]&quot;Once there was an Old Man who rode a blind mule on The Road of Death.&quot;

Scalphunter, raider, killer-for-hire: Kit Hawken has been a bad man for most of his long life. Scalped, tortured, and left for dead by the mysterious order called The Ring, Hawken returns, seeking vengeance... aided by shanghai Mary, a shrewd, opium dealing brothel manager... trailed by Sombre, the deformed, psychotic murderer who was once Kit Hawken&#39;s protege... and surrounded by the ghosts of every person he&#39;s ever killed! Are the phantoms real, or illusions from Hawken&#39;s blood-soaked past? 

With A Man Named Hawken, The Trumans redefine the western horror genre and  prove that the west wasn&#39;t just wild -- it was god damn ugly.[/i]

&quot;[Hawken] is a dirty and foul book. Isn&#39;t that what we want our westerns to be?&quot; - Newsarama

&quot;Hawken has just been too damn good to pass up. The black and white art combined with the gritty western writing makes for a stellar work between the father and son duo.&quot; - Bloody Disgusting

If that sounds like something you&#39;d be interested in, 5 issues are available now. The 6th and final issue will be available in September.
Amazingly, Issue 4 + 5 have sold out completely (!!!), but [url=&#39;https://www.comixology.com/Hawken/comics-series/7009&#39;]you can still purchase this weird western horror series on Comixology[/url].

Or you can wait for the trade!
This series will be collected in a Trade Paperback titled &quot;A MAN NAMED HAWKEN&quot;, to be published in November.

If you&#39;re interested, I hope you can find the time and money to check them out.

And thanks to the entire community for sticking with us on this giant project.
Hopefully these could hold you over until release!

Happy Trails!
