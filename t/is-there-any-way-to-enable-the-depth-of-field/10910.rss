    <title>Is there any way to enable the depth of field?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-there-any-way-to-enable-the-depth-of-field/10910</link>
    <description>As the title says: is there any way to enable the depth of field or ambient occlusion?
I&#39;ve been wondering since I saw this screenshot

But I couldn&#39;t figure out how2.

I tried with the nvidia panel but says that the ambient occlusion isn&#39;t supported by the game, tried with NvidiaInspector to activate it but doesn&#39;t work. Latest version of the driver in case you were wondering.</description>
