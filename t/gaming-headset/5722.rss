    <title>Gaming Headset</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gaming-headset/5722</link>
    <description>I&#39;m seriously getting pissed off. Every single Newegg review contradicts the others. I can&#39;t tell if headsets are good or bad. Atm I&#39;m using a Logtech Clearchat Comfort USB Headset, but I&#39;d like a higher sound quality and full-ear headset. 

I&#39;ve been looking at the [url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826158082&#39;]Creative Fatal1ty Headset[/url], but I don&#39;t know how the sound quality is or if its good because of all the reviews. What headsets do you all use?

Anyone have any suggestions?</description>

            <p>I’m using the Fatality one. Sounds quality’s actually a lot better than I expected from a $50 headset. Apparently it’s supposed to go through the roof if you get the Fatality sound card, but I didn’t bother with that.<br>
It does attract a LOT of dust though, it’s lined with… velour or something.</p>

Not the highest quality headset, but pretty decent. If it gets the job done its good enough for me.</p>

            <p>Ordered a G35 from newegg before checking any replies, it was 50$ off so the deal was just too good. When they come in I’ll tell you how they are comfort wise, sound quality, and if the surround sound is nice. I hope they have a high bass setting, I love bass lol.</p>

            <p>What Kil3r is using isn’t exactly what I have, but it’s very similar. I would go with a Plantronics, mine works very well.</p>

            <p>This thingy mabob right here: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826265065" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826265065</a><br>
I have been using it for 1 - 4 months and so far it has actually WORKED.</p>
<p>The mic catches background sound fairly easily BUT that may not pose a problem if it does not matter to you. The actual quality of the sound from the mic is good and should not have any hissing\ect.</p>
<p>The sound quality of the speakers are just good. It does not support all those super duper dolby digital surround sound modes, so if your really looking for a step up from a normal stereo headset, this headset may not be for you and you’ll probably have to step up the price too.</p>
<p>It is a closed ear headset, and a comfortable one at that. I’ve played entire days without any pain.(If you do end up buying this one, just feel the cloth that is wrapped around the headphones, you will be amazed)</p>
<p>I’ve been using 15-20$ headsets since I got my newest computer and all of them have only lasted a month or so. This headset was a really nice purchase.</p>
<p>Good luck on finding a headset.</p>
