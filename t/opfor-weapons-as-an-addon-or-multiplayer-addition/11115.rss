    <description>feel free to move this if i posted this in the wrong forum


the weapons in opposing force were awesome,right?

well, i do at least think theyre awesome  :wink: 


it would have been cool if someone in the community could make a mod for BMS that add the opposing force weapons!

it would be a great addition to multiplayer and single player and it would make us able to make cool singleplayer maps and multiplayer maps.


halflife multiplayer should be nintendos  super smash bros, you combine every game and make a completely new one.

but in this case we just combine every expansion and then we and up with all the weapons  and the really nice opposing force tdm mode and that kind of stuff.

heres a list of weapons that should be included:

shock roach
displacercannon
spora launcher
barnacle
SAW



youre probably wondering why i didnt include the rest,right?

the rest of the weapons are basicly just reskins of the hl 1 weapons.

i dont expect anyone to do this,but i just had to post a suggestion like this 

:freeman: want more weapons</description>

<p>OP4 did have a few nice maps. I liked the one which had a laboratory where part of the floor and wall were missing and exposed to the outside air, with a tau cannon sitting on a thin piece of debris above a chasm. (I’m just using that part to describe the map; the map as a whole was a good map.)</p>

</aside>
<p>I recall on several occasions someone fired a displacer at me from a few metres away so I then ran towards the displacer ball; it teleported me and the shockwave killed the person that fired it. Mwuahaha! On the other hand, I was a master at using the displacer on enemies, either by kiling them with splash damage, or by running towards enemies and then activating the secondary-fire self teleport. I’d appear somewhere else and a second later I’d see the kill icon from my shockwave blasting them to gibs.</p>

<p>now all we need is a few people who can make this happen!</p>
<p>i would love to have these weapons in singleplayer so i can make cool maps with a lot of weapons.</p>

            <p>I played the hell out of Opposing Force in Deathmatch once upon a time, and I enjoyed it considerably more than the original Half-Life because of it. The new maps replaced the Gluon Gun with the SAW in almost all instances, which is a positive change since the Gluon in multiplayer is really kind of cheap. Plus, I loved all the new weapons.</p>
<p>Not the new maps, though. Can’t say any of the Op4 maps are that good. I still tended to stick to my quad of favourite maps that are Crossfire, Undertow, Snark Pit and Data Core.</p>

            <p>Yeah. OP4 did have some really nice weapons.</p>
<p>The displacer gun in particular could have some really fun mechanics in multiplayer if they make it easier to hit people with.</p>
