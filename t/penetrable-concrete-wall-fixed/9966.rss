    <title>Penetrable Concrete Wall [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/penetrable-concrete-wall-fixed/9966</link>
    <description>I am in Surface Tension, fighting with a good amount of soldiers, where an osprey is dropping them down. Got behind a concrete wall to have some cower, but the soldiers do shoot it through as if it wouldn&#39;t be there at all.  Possibly those two soldiers you see, but they can definetly shoot through the wall.... just like me. No bullet holes if I shoot at it (Edit:  only with the crowbar). Checked it multiple times.

            <p>I’d like to extend my report. Actually the marines can shoot through (the edges usueally) of various objects, like the top of sandbag walls, or through the edge of our freight train’s control machinery in OAR.</p>
