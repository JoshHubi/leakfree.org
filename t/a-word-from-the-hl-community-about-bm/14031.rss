    <title>A word from the HL community about BM</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-word-from-the-hl-community-about-bm/14031</link>
    <description>Please don&#39;t get me wrong, I am very grateful for all of the hard work that has been put into this game. I am also very excited to see the game grow. It seems as if it has already died though, not many people play and the game play feels slow in my opinion. Below is a link to probably the largest remaining HL community left on Steam. They have left their comments on how they feel about the game, and SOME of which I must agree with. Please take time to read this thread and consider what they have to say. I apologize for the harsh criticism that has been written here.

<p>No, it’s full of original HL1 gamers that would like to see the game become more of a success. Enthusiasts of the game if you will that are upset that features in HL1 haven’t been made available in BM yet.</p>

<p>Well, if they want a game to copies HL 1: 1 I have a suggestion: play HL1DM, duh !</p>
<p>Also, bigger success doesn’t equal a more true to the original gameplay or the other way around.</p>
<p>To me this thread sounds more like butthurt hardcore HL hipster elitist douches that can’t accept that BM isn’t exactly the way they wanted it to be. There’s a way around that, but I don’t see them remaking anything.</p>
<p>On another note: No one forces them to buy it or play it.</p>
