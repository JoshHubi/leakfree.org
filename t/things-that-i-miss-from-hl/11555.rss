    <title>Things that I miss from HL.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/things-that-i-miss-from-hl/11555</link>
    <description>Hey there! The BM is awesome and all that, but it seems to bee too easy in comparison to HL. Don&#39;t get it bad, but the Hard difficult in BM is medium in HL. There were also things that I missed like:

1- There is just 2 choppers in Surface Tension that fights to you (I think) and one flies away, when you have to climb up a hill which later leads you to separate ways.

2- There are no tentacles in Surface Tension, as the original HL. I remember that after you climb that hill, there were tentacles on/in the sand, and you were able of finding snarks.

3-The mines. I don&#39;t have any problem with the mines, just that the Snarks that I mentioned used to be used for finding the HIDDEN mines on the original HL. Here the mines you can see it an no problem, but in 1º HL it is one of the hardest parts of the game.

4-The Snipers&#39; bullets it&#39;s exactly the same Sniper bullet used in HL2. Don&#39;t know if it can be fixed, Just saying.

5-The Jumping platforms are not so much used I remember. The only moments that you use the Platform are when the Gargantuar starts to follow you.

6-In On a Rail, I felt like the way was not so labirynth like it used to be in HL.
The last that I remember for the On a Rail in HL was that I had to make everything on foot because I get lost.

7-The Shark is not so hard that it used to be in HL. In HL the sharks had taken the crap out of me and they used to spent me 5 crossbow munition. Here it is just 2 shot and problem solved.

Well these are the little things that I miss from the Half Life.
PS: It would be great that they make an Opposing Force and Blue Shift mod. Just Saying</description>

            <p>Hello there fellow Russian, at least I suspect you are.</p>
<p>All those things have already been mentioned and you know this is a free mod, so anyone is free to modify it to fit their needs, the developers chose to make those changes to improve the ability of new players (who never played HL1) to successfully complete BM.</p>
