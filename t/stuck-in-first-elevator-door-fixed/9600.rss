    <title>Stuck in First Elevator Door [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stuck-in-first-elevator-door-fixed/9600</link>
    <description>Howdy

When I stepped off the elevator in bm_c1a0a (sliughtly before is settled at the ledge) I climbed down the ladder to explore. I then climbed back up and approached the door.

When bm_c1a0b loaded, I was stuck in the door and could not move, and it would not open.

Peace,
