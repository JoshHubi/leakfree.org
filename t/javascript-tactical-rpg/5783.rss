    <title>javascript tactical RPG</title>

    <description>I created the basics for a tactical RPG in javascript for a computing project about a year ago. I had stopped working on it, but have recently started again.

[url]https://www.mediafire.com/?9b9p6iyjg23yq3j[/url]

Normally I run this on a php server to fetch data from a database, I have however changed it to run locally.

Just open the html file.

I&#39;ve used it with FF3.6, IE8, and google chrome; so it should work with these.

Its far from finish and a bit of a mess, but I would like to know what you think.


Edit: 

Instructions
 
 The green guys are your team, if you click on them you will get an area of where they can move. Clicking on the movement area will move the character to that location.

 All characters have 100 AP. AP is used when performing actions. AP does not show up on IE8&#39;s IE7 compatibility mode and probably not IE7 for that reason.
 
The pink characters are the enemy. To attack, move a character adjacent to an enemy, then click on the enemy. Attacking currently costs 10 AP.
 
 The end turn button ... ends the turn. This causes the enemies to take there turn and move towards your nearest character and attack them. After this all your characters will have fully recovered there AP.

if you have any questions just ask.

edit:
I didn&#39;t test the local version in any thing but firefox, and only just found out the vision in the link only works with firefox. I will try to find a server, and post a link to that.</description>
