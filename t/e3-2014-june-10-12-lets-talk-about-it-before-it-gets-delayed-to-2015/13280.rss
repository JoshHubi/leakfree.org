    <description>So yeah,  E3 is just a week away and between rumors, pre-announcements, leaks and plenty of delays, I think this one will be quite a doozy.

For once I think MS will get their act together and not embarrass themselves yet again. Sony seems to have a megaton or two in their sleeves and Nintendo wiil surely put on a good show I believe. 

I honestly think we&#39;re getting a fairly hype show this year.</description>

            <p>“that doesn’t have a silly comic book style plot development”</p>
<p>That’s been there since the very first game, to an extent anyway.<br>
But I get you, the most “grounded” games were RE1,2,3 but with Code Veronica, they decided to go with a resurrection subplot, only so Chris would have a nemesis and the series the main big baddie (who was supposed to be Spencer anyway… yet the only character development he got were cheesy “I was to become a God” line and a hand through his chest) and even though Wesker may have ruined it a lot, he looks and sounds badass, kinda a blend of Adolf Hitler with Agent Smith… I find it hard to dislike him  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Despite Code Veronica having marked the decline of the plot quality, it still is my most favorite RE game because of the Ashford lore, soundtrack, pacing, puzzles and T-Veronica virus is kinda creative in my opinion.</p>
<p>For RE6, despite all its flaws, I enjoyed it great deal and it is decent and much better than user score 2/10 you may see on the internet, if I say so myself, for the mere fact that I was one of the biggest haters of RE6 before I decided to try it out and proved myself wrong.</p>
<p>People shouldn’t believe either the hype or the hate.</p>

            <p>So I was looking forward to Hyrule Warriors before, but now…</p>
<p>I’m even more excited! Coop gameplay and combat focus in a Zelda game? That’s my kind of game!<br>
As for the actual Wii U Zelda game…I can tell you I’m excited, but I have no idea what this game is going to be like. I’ll definitely keep watch on it, but the trailer sure didn’t tell me anything.</p>

            <p>The canon has gotten too complex and weird by now.</p>
<p>I just want a Resident Evil game that doesn’t have a silly comic book style plot development and instead focuses on the moment to moment situations of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Give me a big fucking house infested with zombies, puzzling shit to solve and low resources to manage.</p>

            <p>When you’ve got a single worm in an apple, then you don’t throw it away whole, just cut out the afflicted part. Unless your name is Bear Grylls, in which case you would probably eat it as is.</p>
<p>I’m not all for a reboot. It still hasn’t reached the point of no salvation in my opinion. The roots of the canon are very solid, to me at least anyway. They just need to produce a game that actually moves the whole series forward rather than these separate irrelevant adventures.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, Resident Evil 6 was all about character development, even though in some cases forced. But it may be hard to progress at this point for sure, since most of the villains and their corporations and done for, so anything will seem like an asspull.</p>
<p>There’s still Tricell I believe, not to mention Ada’s mysterious organization, Alex Wesker and so on. Plenty to explore, only needs to be properly executed.</p>

<p>In all truthfulness I thought Nintendo had the best “conference” this year. They had didn’t take themselves seriously and I thought that was pretty refreshing. They also had a great showing in games, even after the digital event was over.</p>
<p>-Zelda Wii U<br>
-Hyrule Warriors<br>

            <p>In all truthfulness I thought Nintendo had the best “conference” this year. They had didn’t take themselves seriously and I thought that was pretty refreshing. They also had a great showing in games, even after the digital event was over.</p>
<p>-Zelda Wii U<br>
-Hyrule Warriors<br>
-Bayonetta 2<br>
-Devil’s Third<br>
-Xenoblade Chronicles<br>
-Yoshi’s Woolly World<br>
-Super Smash Bros.<br>
-Splatoon<br>
-Freakin’ Star Fox</p>
<p>They all look ace in my opinion.</p>

            <p>whatever we may all say about nintendo these days, they will probally be the last console race that survives as they are the only ones who continue to provide unique experiences that cannot be seen on pc (and the other 2 consoles that try so hard to be like it)</p>

<p>Nintendo doesn’t need a change of style but they need a more progressive management that is always up to date on what’s new in the tech world and isn’t afraid of adopting new things in gaming as long as they benefit the games and gamers.</p>
<p>LIKE A FUCKING UNIFIED ACCOUNT SYSTEM.</p>

            <p>They basically didn’t change the multi-thread code in GTA4, so it maxes out at 3 cores, which is what the 360 cpu has. It runs better the faster your CPU is but a more powerful GPU makes less of a difference than in other games since it’s a CPU heavy game.</p>
<p>Since then they have practically overhauled the entire engine, which is why GTA5 looks insane on consoles and runs better than GTA4.</p>

            <p>It’s not a port, Dotard. The PC version has been in development since mid 2012 if you can trust the leaked bug logs that you can dump off the PS3 version’s disc.</p>
<p>Also GTAIV is a bad port, sersoft. You might be able to get it running satisfactorily, but compared to other open world games (like Sleeping Dogs, which looks better) it runs poorly.</p>
