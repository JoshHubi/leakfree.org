    <title>Freezing right after finishing a load...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/freezing-right-after-finishing-a-load/11453</link>
    <description>Hello. Black Mesa keeps freezing right after one of the loading... messages appears. But only in that specific one.

The scene I am crashing is the following: When the player&#39;s cart goes out of control and crashes into a door, falling two stories and into water. I had to noclip out of the water since I didn&#39;t find any valve or anything I could move. In the scene right after that when you are running through the tunnels, I get a normal loading... message and then the game continues for 0.7 seconds and freezes, i have to ctrl+alt+del out of Black mesa to kill the process.

Does anyone know why this happens?</description>

            <p>It worked! I wasn’t even supposed to go in the tunnels.</p>

<p>You are supposed to some orange barrels underneath the ‘bridge’, to raise it - you may then progress to the next segment of the map.</p>
<p>It could be the case that the game was expecting you to solve the puzzle, but since you just noclipped past it, the next map may crash due to the puzzle not being solved in the previous level (Example: Game expects state 1, but gets state 0), if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Try solving the puzzle legitimately, then proceeding to the next level / map.</p>

<p>Also, try loading a savegame of the previous map (before the map where the tram crashes), when attempting to solve puzzle.</p>
