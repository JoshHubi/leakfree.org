    <title>Retakes of some of the voice-overs</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/retakes-of-some-of-the-voice-overs/153</link>
    <description>I recall a thread in the other forum about retaking some of the lines from the trailer. I have to agree. Barney&#39;s line especially, &quot;We had a system crash about, I don&#39;t know, 20 minutes ago and I&#39;m still trying to find my files. Just one of those days I guess&quot;.

The line wasn&#39;t done horribly, but the line lacks a sense of preoccupation that the original had. The original line felt some anxiety by Barney, fixing the problem with his computer while trying to give Gordon a simple message. However the new line feels as though Barney is not bothered by the system crash, and is fully focused on giving Gordon the message.

It may be semantics, and new players may not care or notice, but the new line feels too much like foreshadow, as if to imply that shit will in fact hit the fan, where as in the original the first 10 minutes of the game are designed to give the player the immediate impression that nothing will go wrong, and nothing is expected to go wrong, and there is no doubt in anyone&#39;s mind that there is a reason to expect anything other than the day before, except of course those directly responsible for the test chamber&#39;s instruments.

By giving any form of foreshadow outside of the test chamber and its related sub-rooms could detriment the plausibility of the emotions conveyed by the same sprites following the resonance cascade, such as Barney&#39;s &quot;What the hell are these things Gordon? And why are they wearing science uniforms?&quot;.

Just my 43 cents and a Canadian twonie.</description>

<p>I remember hearing the version in the trailer and thinking that it dropped hot shit on the original. Especially the way it syncs with the sounds effects. Don’t change a thing IMO.</p>

<p>Yeah, that bit of the trailer creeps me out. I love how you hear “oh god!” just as the beam causes an explosion in the observation room.  I love it.</p>

<p>There won’t be one. It’ll just be a small pitch change if anything.<br>
It’s hard to do properly sometimes, but if they stick with HL’s pitch, they should come out OK.</p>

<p>Would I be able to go in and change the voices to another sound file, and redo the voices myself if I wanted to?</p>
<p>Not that I hate the voice acting that I’ve heard, but I’m just curious.</p>

<p>I’m not overly fussed about foreign voices. One or two in scripted sequences might be nice, but it’s no big deal.

            <p>Keep in mind, one may need to re-animate each voice syncing with FacePoser if they decided to redo some of the lines. So, I guess the more you request modifications, the further away the delay gets pushed to 2010.</p>

<p>You were already on it. Did I neglect to tell you?</p>
<p>So have we all agreed to perhaps wait till release before we pick apart the work?</p>

<p>I like you - and be it only for that last post of yours <em>g</em>. But I suppose that’s not gonna help 'coz I am an insignificant stranger here…[/SIZE]</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Topic</span>:</p>
<p>I really like how Barney sounds so unnerved in the trailer. In the original he sounded more hectic, working hard to restore order to his desktop computer, but now he sounds more like a real man who has to deal with a fucked up computer. (“F**k you windows bluescreen! I hate you!”) <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>“…we had a system crash about <span class="bbcode-i">- I dunno - twenty minutes ago</span>, and I’m still trying to find my files. Just one of those days, I guess…”</p>
<p>Perfect!</p>
<p>In “Streloks Improved Version” of Half-Life: Source you can often hear gunshots, screams of panic or imminent death, explosions and the sounds of monsters from afar, as if something terrible is going on in the nearby laboratories. That added a lot to the immersion and the atmosphere of utter chaos and sudden horror. I realize that a lot of human screams have been recorded for Black Mesa now - are there going to be background sounds like these in the final version of your game? At least whenever the player roams through areas where it would make sense to hear them?</p>

            <p>Maybe it’s just nostalgia, although that’s a bit unlikely considering I only got around to playing Half-Life about a month ago (after seeing the Black Mesa trailer). Anyway, I don’t like to complain, nor am I in any position to do so. I’m still curious if there was a reason behind the change, but it’s certainly not something that will prevent me from playing and having a good time.</p>

            <p>I remember hearing the version in the trailer and thinking that it dropped hot shit on the original. Especially the way it syncs with the sounds effects. Don’t change a thing IMO.</p>

            <p>I actually liked that line. It di take out some of the “I can still fix this” from his voice, but it added a more realistic panic and a horrific feeling that the original was lacking.</p>
