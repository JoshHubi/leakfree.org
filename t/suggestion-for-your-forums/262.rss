    <description>Can you please do something about your image verification thing. It is a big problem for those how have bad eyesight. it took me 20 minutes trying to type in the right words. I have enough trouble seeing even the words I am typing here with out them being made even more hard to read. I can understand the need for such a thing. but it should have something for those who can not see or hear the words.</description>
