    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-tau-cannon-its-not-so-effective/10357</link>
    <description>The Tau cannon its my favorite weapon since i play HL.

In the mod is to inaccurate and slow, in hl i can get many frags easy but here it is not so reliable, altough it presentaion is great!

I think that it was optimised to destroy thanks but not npcs</description>

<p>They make it seem as if it actually shoots Tau particles, so I’m gonna go with the former.</p>

<p>Right especially since the Gluon gun shoots… well Gluons.<br>
Which btw is super bad ass in this mod. It had a great sound in HL1 but it is an absolute monster in this and I love to use it</p>

or less likely that is causes “Shear Stress” on bad guys (denoted as Tau in physical mathematics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress</a>)</p>

<p>Uhhh with the primary or secondary?  If the primary…I played the original at least a hundred times and I never saw that unless I kept firing at their dying body…like a few times.  In BM, I found that they died pretty fast but I actually haven’t tried the secondary  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">   I would think they would with the secondary fire, but I guess I think of the gun as being more of a laser gun or something.  Like highly accelerated radioactive particles being shot in a concentrated beam.</p>

            <p>Well enemies only gib if they take an exceptional amount of damage that puts their health into some large negative number at the time of death. Only powerful explosives are able to do that. Also, ragdolls will gib if you do something ridiculous to them after death.</p>
<p>Magnum and shotgun also occasionally gib. And the .50 definitely gibs. Epic fun. :3</p>

            <p>Easily one of the most effective weapons in the game now against vehicles. One full charge seems to be equivalent to something like three rockets on hard mode, and it gibs enemies without needing much of a charge-up.</p>
