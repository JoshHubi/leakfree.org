    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ati-eyefinity/2173</link>
    <description>I&#39;m curious if anyone has their sights set on trying this out. I&#39;m highly considering it seeing as that I can save myself three hundred dollars by not getting the TripleHead2Go for 2x GTX285s. I watched a video review on the product but the group that did it works with ATI so I&#39;m thinking they were paid off to say certain things. 

The only issues with the current cards are that you can only use 2x DVI ports and a Display Port with an adapter to use a third screen and they&#39;re soon to be releasing the true 6 monitor cards within the next couple months.

Just looking for feedback on this.</description>

            <p>Well, you took what I said out of context. The rest of the system was medium grade and the card was high end so they can see how the card acts instead of the CPU and memory assisting it.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is a medium end rig if not borderline low end.</p>
<p>Also, you can’t run ‘from what the review said’ two 5870s in CrossfireX using Eyefinity. So if a 5970 is what’s needed then I would probably go that route.</p>

            <p>It out performs two 5850s in CrossfireX and it will equal, if not out perform, two 5870s in CrossfireX for $200 less when you use the overvolt OC’ing tool.</p>

<p>IIRC it’s more of a 5850x2.</p>

            <p>No, I know this, but ATi has the 4000 series available to view.</p>
<p>My build is currently in my shopping cart at <a href="http://newegg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">newegg.com</a>. It’s a pretty penny, but that is besides the point. I just hope they release the solid cards for eyefinity within the next few months since this is when I’ll be purchasing my rig.</p>

<p>Which ATi card are thinkin about gettin? 5750? 5770? 5850? 5870? 5970?</p>

<p>Looking at the 5870s, but I don’t like the fact they don’t have the 6 outputs like I’ve seen some cards have. ATi doesn’t even have them on their website to buy [any of the 5000 series].</p>
<p>I only intend to use three monitors max [for now] and I’m holding out for them to release a Crossfire compatible eyefinity card so I can boot up two and get some insane frames. I’ve seen a few reviews with a medium end computer with the 5870 and they had to tone down Crysis [5760x1200] to medium with no AA and were only pulling 35 average frames per second [No where near what I’m looking for]. Though the rig I have laid out so far is a very high end system and should be able to run Crysis at, at least, 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>I’m going to be checking daily for updates on the hardware and software. I’ll keep you all posted with links and what not.</p>

            <p>Hmmm… I’ll have to remember this stuff when my current computer finally dies like it should have a year ago and I can replace it.</p>
<p>I do, however, wonder if making the screen TOO big, while looking cool, is going to hinder gaming ability by forcing the outer edges of the screen to your real peripheral vision, and not  just a temporary one created by your insane focus on the dead center of the screen.</p>
