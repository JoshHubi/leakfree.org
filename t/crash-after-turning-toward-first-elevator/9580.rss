    <title>Crash After Turning Toward First Elevator</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-after-turning-toward-first-elevator/9580</link>
    <description>Hello all! Let me take this time to say thank you for all your hard work, this mod/game is beautiful. But, alas, I ran into a little problem. I seem to crash every time I try to turn the corner after walking through the 2 doors into the blue area (pic below). I&#39;ve tried multiple fixes... updating drivers, turning down visuals even though its recommended for everything on high, turning off background programs, etc. etc. 


I give you my specs first:

Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 64-bit
AMD Radeon HD 3870
AMD Phenom II X6 1045T Processor 2.70 GHz
8 GB Ram

Don&#39;t know where to find all the information, but I would suspect this is good enough. Now here is the minidump:

Hope to hear back soon, I cannot wait to get this working. Thank you in advance for all your help.

{EDIT}: The 2 doors I am talking about is at the very beginning of the game, before anything even starts happening.</description>

            <p>Ok, so I believe I fixed it, but ran into another problem. First, the solution. All I did was go to Task Manager&gt;Processes&gt;right click hl2.exe (or something similar)&gt;Set Affinity&gt; Uncheck all but one box (Processor 0 or whatever). I heard it fixed quite a few people’s problems in the forum, and it also fixed mine… or at least I can get in the elevator and continue now.</p>
<p>Now that thats out of the way, the problem. Not huge, but annoying all the same. I get these weird graphic glitches on the people and they have purple eyes and blood all over them (as seen in the pic). Not something HUGE, and I can continue in the game, but its irritating nonetheless. Anyway, hope to hear back about this glitch, but is much less important to fix as the last one was.</p>

            <p>I too am getting a crash after the first lift.  It descends OK, which then triggers a level load, which then crashes.</p>
