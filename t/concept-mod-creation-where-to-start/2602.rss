    <title>Concept Mod Creation, Where to Start...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/concept-mod-creation-where-to-start/2602</link>
    <description>I&#39;m seeking advice and suggestions from experienced mod developers. 

     I&#39;ve currently been jotting down ideas for a mod I would like to try and put into the works from a classic memorable game I&#39;ve played from the original Playstation. The ideas I have would require a complete revamp of game play and of course, models. 

    This isn&#39;t a project that I want to take on by myself. However, my plan is to develop a single level/map from the beginning of the game I am striving to recreate as a &quot;concept mod&quot;. All I want to do is make a single level/map with just enough game play and features that make people&#39;s mouth&#39;s water (If it will even do that) and to show a semi big picture of this game I am trying to recreate. 

    If all proves successful and people show allot of interest in the mod I would then start to seek out a team for the project. 

   My question is; Where do I start? Is level design the first step to designing a mod? Is it diving into coding and programming the game play I have in mind first? Or should I be designing models first? 

    Weapons are going to be basic. No energy based weapons, just straight realistic modern weaponry. I think the hardest part will be implementing the game play I have in mind. 
  
    Anyway I&#39;ve babbled on enough. Thanks in advanced to any responses!</description>

            <p>Well, right now since I didn’t get any helpful responses I’m just going to work on the models. I have an old time friend who is an exceptional artist. I am going to see if he will draw up the models so I can get to work in XSI. (Mod tool)</p>
<pre><code> [YC]sgsells42 After I get the models done and if you're still interested I'll send you images of the models to see if you want to get in on this still. PM me your e-mail address if you'd like.</code></pre>
