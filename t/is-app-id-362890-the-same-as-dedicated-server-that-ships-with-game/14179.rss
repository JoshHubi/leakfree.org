    <title>Is app ID &quot;362890&quot; the same as Dedicated server that ships with game.</title>

    <description>Hello,
Is the dedicated server that ships with the game (srcds) the same as the one you would download via Steam cmd app ID &quot;362890&quot;?

The Steam cmd seems to require steam id and password  to d/l and i would rather not do that. if its the same then np.


c:/steamcmd/steamcmd.exe +login anonymous +force_install_dir c:/bms_ded +app_update 362890 validate +quit
pause


returns  &quot;no subscription&quot; error  Thanks</description>
