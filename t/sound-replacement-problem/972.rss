    <title>Sound Replacement Problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sound-replacement-problem/972</link>
    <description>I have the Beta Gravity Gun launching sound as a .wav file.  So I was going to replace the original sound of the gravity gun with this one.  I made a folder called sounds, then made a folder in that one called weapons, then physcannon in that one and put the .wav file in it.  I put it in C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/youaccountname/half-life 2/hl2.  I pasted the sounds folder in there and it woun&#39;t use that sound in-game.  Any help here would be great.</description>
