    <title>Dinner and a Game Thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dinner-and-a-game-thread/8138</link>
    <description>Post pics of what you had for dinner and a game you played over it. I&#39;ll start things off:

A succulent stir-fry and &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior.&quot;

(FSW is a PSN download, hence no box art)

Ordinarily I&#39;d go with a box art next to the food instead, like this:

So, how &#39;bout it? What are you eating and playing?</description>

<p>I just came 'round to show how much of a spelling Nazi I am when it comes to Spanish, and say that it’s <span class="bbcode-b">avocado</span>, not avacado. And, as it happens, I love the stuff - hard to come by here in Eastern Europe, but back in Latin America, I would have some almost everyday. I heard there is some kinda powdered avocado available, anyone tried it?</p>

Dessert. A spot of candy, egg nog, and Forza Motorsport 3. (No, I’m not eating the whole box. Just one or two at the most, it’s seriously rich chocolate.)</p>

<p>I agree with the spirit of this sentence.  Aside from interacting with games, how is watching TV and playing games while you eat any different, Fergus?</p>
<p>I admit, I have had a few meals in front of a computer or TV, but I usually prefer to have dinner with people instead of alone.</p>

<p>Yes, yes… reading a newspaper or watching TV is acceptable but playing a game? JEEEEESUS CHRIST!</p>
<p>Being 100% serious, I don’t see how doing either of those things is more normal than playing a game while you eat. You might as well try being a proper person saying that you should always eat around a table and not read or watch tv or game while you eat, in which case you sound like a miserable old bitch.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Meals are only to be eaten with a fork and knife from a dish.  Meals are to be a shared experience with others around a table so conversation and reflection upon the day may be had.  Distractions from human interaction, such as radios and TVs, are detrimental to the entire experience.  Remember your manners and eating etiquette.</p>
<p>EDIT: It’s really amazing how exactly opposite most of my meals within the past three years have been from the above statement.</p>

<p>wat<br>
So what you’re saying is, you should spend your time eating doing something you enjoy? Like reading the newspaper or watching TV?<br>
Why is that any different from playing games.</p>

            <p>The one from a few weeks ago was the first one I took- it was a joke for a friend on the spur of the moment. So technically yes, I did make this up for the thread, and I happened to have a photo on my hard drive from said joke to include.</p>
<p>As for gaming and food- generally the only time I have for games is when I’m eating. I’m generally otherwise doing college stuff or doing housework. I used to have a lot more time for games than I do now- in fact in high school during summer I’d routinely stay up till past 4am just playing the hell out of my games.</p>
<p>Nowadays I’m more pressed for time, and I happen to just play games and eat at the same time. It’s easier to do with games that require less controller input, such as a turn based RPG, since I don’t need to micromanage unit movement from moment to moment like I would a shooter, or be on the trigger at all times like a racing game.</p>

            <p>Why the fuck do you take pictures of your food and game everyday? Seeing how you had a picture from a few weeks ago, this isn’t something you just made up for this thread.</p>
<p>Also, this thread is actually kind of stupid, if you can’t leave the gaming for a while to eat, there’s something wrong with you. Seriously, meal is when you read the newspaper, watch TV or just looking out into thin air. I bet you don’t spend more than 2 minutes at the loo either?</p>

            <p>Salsa picante, the avacado (obviously), five or so cloves of garlic, and a pinch of lime juice.</p>
<p>I have a more specialized recipe that I got from a really fucking good tex mex place (in Texas, hence the fucking good guac) that involved pumpkin seeds, but I don’t get to make it very often.</p>
