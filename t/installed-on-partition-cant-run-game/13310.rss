    <title>Installed on partition, can&#39;t run game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/installed-on-partition-cant-run-game/13310</link>
    <description>Hi, I got a sudden urge to replay Half Life yesterday and tought that this would be a ample opportunity to check out Black Mesa. However I can&#39;t seem to get the game to run.

I know that it&#39;s recommended to install it in the C:\ drive, but my drives are partitioned and my C:\ drive is really small.

I have installed SDK Base 2007 and Black Mesa to D:\SteamLibrary and the patch for SDK is [i]D:\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\Source SDK Base 2007[/i]
whereas for Black Mesa it&#39;s [i]D:\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS[/i].

I&#39;ve also setup D:\SteamLibrary as one of the Steam Library Folders in Steam.
Lastly I&#39;ve edited the Launch Options of SDK 2007 to [i]D:\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS[/i] which I saw in another thread, however, this just boots me into a fullscreen SDK where I can only perform a Video Stress Test.


Do I have to have HL2 installed? Or can I somehow create a .cmd file which correctly identifies how to run the game? Or preferably, just get it to appear in my Steam list of games</description>

            <p>the launch options have to be example -novid -console -game “D:…\BMS”</p>
<p>or better yet make a shortcut to hl2.exe in source SDK Base 2007 folder and in the shortcut properties add -game “D:…\BMS” right after hl2.exe in the target box, always worked for me.</p>
<p>don’t forget the quotation marks, doesn’t matter if there are no spaces in the command line…</p>
<p>if all else fails move the steam folder with the steam.exe to D:\ and that should solve your problem.</p>
