    <title>Guys which one should I play now</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/guys-which-one-should-i-play-now/7527</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got 3 games that I want to play on my pc but I got no idea which one should I play first, I&#39;m playing SP since the Internet really fucks up here when you play MP and download stuff at the same time. Right, I&#39;m trying to torrent download the new Harry Potter movie.
The games are:

- Brothers in Arms: Hell&#39;s Highway
Just started playing it again (I got to &quot;The rabbit hole&quot; last time I play) but now I&#39;m still at the level AFTER &quot;Operation Garden&quot; (I forgot the name)

- Company of Heroes
I went far last time but I lost my saves and my current progress is:
Americans: Mission 2
Commonwealth: Mission 1
Panzer Elite: Mission 3

- Morrowind
Never bothered the main quest, and haven&#39;t even explored the east anyhow (I&#39;m still questing around West Gash Region)

            <p>The one that I hated was when you had to defend that square with very little resources for about 30 mins, and you had like howitzers pounding you the whole time (destroying them is a secondary objective, but there’s no way you can do it).</p>

<p>Hell’s Highway is a lot of fun. I’d go with that one. Company of Heroes is fun in Single Player until you get to the Redball Express. (That one with the huge road.) That mission is fucking <span class="bbcode-i">impossible.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Redball express is complicated at first, but after you destroy the German base that keeps pumping unit on you to the north, it gets a lot easier<br>
Also, use your Sherman tanks</p>
