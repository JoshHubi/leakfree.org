    <title>Very Specific question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/very-specific-question/11531</link>
    <description>I can never download via Steam the source Sdk Base 2007 needed to play Black Mesa. My internet does not have the bandwidth Is there an alternative that you have used that works? Is there a HL game I could buy that you know has the  source Sdk Base 2007 required to play. Only reply if you know. No guesses.

Thanks</description>

<p>Great. I have HL 2 EPI 1. It is installed. What do I need do then, if you please?<br>
I have the mod and it installed fine. After install the mod (or something ) connects to Steam and begins downloading the source. I stopped that. Now that it is installed (the mod ) how do I direct it to use the data from HL 2 EPI 1. Also, I don’t see how to make the mod run or even launch it to connect with Steam.</p>
<p>Thank You for the reply and any further help you can offer.</p>

<p>You still have to download Source SDK Base 2007, but the more source games you have installed, the less you’ll need to download. I only get 2GB of internet a month, but I have all the Half-Life 2 and Portal games with Black Mesa and The Stanley Parable running just fine. So, having HL2/E1/E2 and Portal/2 installed, the base was roughly 30MB to download. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>All Source games have most of the required data.  Half Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and Episode 2, Half-Life: Deathmatch, Counter-Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2, Portal, Portal 2, Day of Defeat: Source, Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, and Alien Swarm.  You’ll still have to download some data, but not as much.  And you’ll have to download the mod itself (you can’t get most of the files from any of these sources).</p>

<p>OK, a little more info. I copied the shortcut for HL 2 EPI 1 and changed it from <a>steam://rungameid/218</a> and this screen appears<img src="https://www.coyoterock.net/pix/screen.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
