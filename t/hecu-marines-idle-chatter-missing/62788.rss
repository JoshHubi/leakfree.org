    <title>HECU marines idle chatter missing?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hecu-marines-idle-chatter-missing/62788</link>
    <description>Hi everyone. Not sure if bug or intentional, the HECU marines seem to be missing their idle chatter they originally had in Half-Life. The &quot;squad checks&quot; don&#39;t seem to be playing when you&#39;re near an active squad, which served to warn you that a marines were nearby, so they regularly surprise me by staying so silent. I&#39;m using the classic HECU voices mod and I miss the &quot;SQUAD. CHECK IN.&quot; &quot;UHHHH... YES. SIR.&quot; :frowning:</description>

            <p>Hi everyone. Not sure if bug or intentional, the HECU marines seem to be missing their idle chatter they originally had in Half-Life. The “squad checks” don’t seem to be playing when you’re near an active squad, which served to warn you that a marines were nearby, so they regularly surprise me by staying so silent. I’m using the classic HECU voices mod and I miss the “SQUAD. CHECK IN.” “UHHHH… YES. SIR.” <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
