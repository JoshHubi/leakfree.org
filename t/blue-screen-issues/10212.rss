    <description>Hi there Black Mesa community, 
I&#39;ve been having some issues with Black Mesa.
Every so often, the game freezes for a few seconds, the sounds that are playing at the time stutter and repeat, the whole thing freezes and my computer shuts down with a blue screen error. This is very annoying.
Please help me!</description>

            <p>I used to get the exact same error with some games almost instantly, and in other games after a while</p>
<p>I fixed it by installing the latest graphics card drivers, and resetting the clock speed on my video card (it came factory overclocked)</p>
