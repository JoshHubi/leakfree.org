    <title>Hi Black Mesa Mapping.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hi-black-mesa-mapping/3877</link>
    <description>My brother thinks that all of the mapping is the same as in half life and only a little been changed. He thinks the little been changed is only the models/sounds/materials/textures/.
Oh he just stated that when HL Black M. comes out he can  do a step by step movement and find himself in the same room in hl.

I think the mapping is completely different, but kept the level&#39;s the same. The HL. Black M. maps are on the same grounds as the half life maps, but Added flavor and Replay value.


I like to know what you guys think is different about Half Life mapping vs Half life Black Mesas Mapping</description>

            <p>i am pretty sure that the maps are going to be expanded upon considerably from the originals</p>
<p>while it is true that you will see many of the same rooms from the original half life i am expecting to see a lot of new and expanded areas as well</p>
<p>also</p>

</aside>
<p>source <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> an updated fork of gldsrc which itself is mostly rewritten from ids quake engine</p>
<p>it is true in fact that there is still native quake code present in half life 2 as noted by john carmack himself</p>
<p>before you come back arguing check it out on wikipedia:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">From</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_%28game_engine%29#Origins" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_%28game_engine%29#Origins</a></p>
<p>Source distantly originates from the GoldSrc engine, itself a heavily modified version of the QuakeWorld  iteration of John D. Carmack’s Quake engine, as is explained by Valve employee Erik Johnson on the Valve Developer Community</p>
<pre><code>When we were getting very close to releasing Half-Life (less than a week or so), we found there were already some projects that we needed to start working on, but we couldn't risk checking in code to the shipping version of the game. At that point we forked off the code in VSS to be both $/Goldsrc and /$Src. Over the next few years, we used these terms internally as "Goldsource" and "Source". At least initially, the Goldsrc branch of code referred to the codebase that was currently released, and Src referred to the next set of more risky technology that we were working on. When it came down to show Half-Life 2 for the first time at E3, it was part of our internal communication to refer to the "Source" engine vs. the "Goldsource" engine, and the name stuck.
</code></pre>
<p>Source was developed part-by-part from this fork onwards, slowly replacing GoldSrc in Valve’s internal projects and explaining in part the reasons behind its unusually modular nature. Valve’s development of Source since has been a mixture of licensed middleware (Havok Physics, albeit heavily modified, and MP3 playback) and in-house-developed code.</p>
<p>John Carmack commented on his blog in 2004 that "there are still bits of early Quake code in Half-Life 2</p>

<p>Look at the Half-Life 2 Alpha for starters. You can clearly see it’s halfway between GoldSrc and Source.</p>

<p>Good day to you fine gentlemen. I’d like to have a word with you about the maps we’ll be seeing in black mesa.</p>
<p>My brother is under the impression all the maps are identical to the maps in hl1 apart from the models/sounds/materials/textures. With little to no changes to the actual shape or size of the maps.<br>
He believes moving from point A to point B will require the same number of movements in hl1 as it will require in black mesa.</p>
<p>I on the other hand believe the maps will be completely overhauled, with added rooms, higher ceilings, nude calendars, hell you name it. But overall I believe the levels will remain the same. This together with the better graphics will contribute to a higher replay value.</p>
<p>In conclusion I like to know what you gentlemen think the differences between the hl1 and black mesa maps will be.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So…yeah, your brother is wrong. On a rail has been shortened, the map of the dam has been enlarged, and so on. Black mesa won’t be just new textures and models.</p>

            <p>Is he taking about creating maps for Black Mesa or is he talking about Black Mesa’s maps related to the original hl?</p>

            <p>All the maps have completely different brush work, lighting, textures, etc. They are based on the original maps but are expanded considerably.</p>

            <p>Um the “mapping” is the same because we use the same tool as other mods do to create maps…valve hammer editor.</p>
<p>The only addition or “difference” is the assets (textures,models,animations) and entities…</p>

            <p>My brother thinks that all of the mapping is the same as in half life and only a little been changed. He thinks the little been changed is only the models/sounds/materials/textures/.<br>
Oh he just stated that when HL Black M. comes out he can  do a step by step movement and find himself in the same room in hl.</p>
<p>I think the mapping is completely different, but kept the level’s the same. The HL. Black M. maps are on the same grounds as the half life maps, but Added flavor and Replay value.</p>
<p>I like to know what you guys think is different about Half Life mapping vs Half life Black Mesas Mapping</p>
