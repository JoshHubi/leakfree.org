    <description>Lol, I can almost feel the shitstorm before I post this, but I&#39;ll have a go anyway.

I&#39;m running an acer aspire 5920 lappy and I&#39;d like to upgrade the graphics.  Now before somebody replies and trolls/flames me, it&#39;s one of the earlier ones, with (what I&#39;m lead to believe is) a removable Geforce 8600M GS graphics card.  Which lets me get by at the minute.  However I&#39;m a graphics slut, and love messing about/upgrading/taking stuff apart.  So I&#39;d like to upgrade.

AFAIK it&#39;s an MXM2 type card.  I&#39;m having a bit of trouble googling any decent info on upgrading these cards and whatnot (yes I know this is not a good sign) but I thought I&#39;d ask here, because there are some nice friendly geniuses on these here forums who may be able to advise me. :wink: 

Also if it ain&#39;t happenin can I have a reason. Answers which just say &quot;no&quot; won&#39;t educate me, and I like to be educated. :stuck_out_tongue: 

Thanks in advance for any advice!</description>

            <p>They also said they had other cards availablem just ask.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It looks like they want to make sure a card will work in a machine before they sell it in their store, but they also asked for testers in a couple places too.</p>

            <p>Thanks guys, Jim that site seems pretty informative I’ll maybe drop them an email.  They mention my laptop a few times on the site. Although the two cards they’ve tested in my machine are either the same or worse than the one it came with.</p>
<p>Shrike, I am glad I don’t have a dell, I think my card is accessable from the underside of the laptop.</p>
<p>Yeah I knew about the asus jobbie.  Figured I’d look into internal before I started.</p>
<p>Main problem with the card thats in it is that it very hot as soon as graphics are thrown at it (its a known problem).  It can’t be particularly good for the laptop.</p>
<p>Sersoft, yeah there’s a lot of different laptop graphic standards.  I’m pretty sure mine has the upgrade, that mxm-site has good info.  They have a new mxm2 card there, at around £100 (I’m in the UK) it might be worth the money to test it. Well after I get paid lol.  Next mission is to  build a desktop that rivals my work pc…</p>

            <p>Here’s a page that has a few MXM-II type cards. The prices are in Euros, but they say they ship to the USA (assuming that that’s where you live).</p>

            <p>There are some laptops that have cards that you can manually upgrade, I don’t know how to do it though.</p>
<p>Does this help?<br>

            <p>The only option I know of for you is to get an external GFX card connector. I know ASUS had one but idk if they still make it.</p>

            <p>Sorry but to my best knowledge the fact that it’s removable doesn’t mean it fits other models of removable graphics cards, it just means they can sell laptops with onboard GPU and offer the 8600GS as an upgrade.</p>
