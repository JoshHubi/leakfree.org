    <title>GPU vs CPU upgrade</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gpu-vs-cpu-upgrade/4837</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;m going to be upgrading either my gpu or my cpu next month. My price range is only 120$. Don&#39;t even think about saying &quot;Get both, and also upgrade RAM and get a liquid nitrogen cooling system&quot; (sarcasm) I&#39;m only getting 1 and I was wondering if I should upgrade my cpu or gpu. I mostly game on my pc.
My specs:
3GB DDR2 Ram
GeForce 9600 GT 512MB DDR3
AMD Athlon X2 5000+ at 2.6 ghz

My cpu is dragging but I only play games on my pc, I only have one PCI express slot so if I get a new video card my current one is going bye bye, no dual GPUs. I was looking at an AMD Phenom X4 9850. I don&#39;t think this would be too much of an improvement however. I&#39;m not sure what GPU I&#39;d get, but I&#39;m pretty sure the 9600 is one of the best cards for my price range. Any help would be appreciated. Also, be nice, not everyone has $3000 dollars to spend on a hobby.</description>

<p>At that point it would be easier to argue that he buy a CPU.  The only reason I was recommending a GPU was the budget.  If your gonna save up more money I suggest just saving for a CPU.

<p>Actually, for his socket, he could upgrade his CPU for much cheaper than a GPU.</p>
<p>In any case, upgrading the GPU will always have a much bigger impact on your gaming performance than anything else. The GPU is doing almost all of the work when you’re playing a game. The CPU is really just a bottleneck for the GPU to work in. As long as the CPU is halfway decent, then the GPU can work to full capacity.</p>
<p>His CPU is fine, so upgrading it would have pretty much zero effect on gaming, plus it’s a big hassle to change. However, upgrading to a card that isn’t much better than his current card would also be pointless. That’s why I suggested he waited until he had $30-$70 more so he could buy a worthwhile upgrade.</p>

<p>In any case, if your budget is dead-set at $120 right now, my advice would be to wait. There’s no sense in jumping the gun and upgrading to a card that’s only slightly better than what you have already. Wait until you can afford more and then buy a better card that will noticably improve your gaming experience.</p>
<p>Also, I wouldn’t recommend buying a used card, unless the manufacturer’s warranty is still good and that’s all the assurance you need. If you buy new then you have the store/site warranty plus the full manufacturer’s warranty (and that feeling of unwrapping a brand-new toy  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  )</p>

            <p>At ~$120, you’re not looking at very good upgrade options. If you can somehow bump it up to about ~$150, you could get a Radeon HD5770 1gb, which would be a good upgrade for the price. If you can get to about $200, you could go with an Nvidia GTX 460 1gb or an ATI 5830 1gb, which would be better upgrades.</p>

            <p>For an ATI, you could get an HD 4870, or whatever the equivalent is for their DirectX11 lineup. I believe they both cost about $150 on Newegg.</p>

<p>Thanks! Can you think of any cards that would be a significant improvement for my price range?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If I can go ahead and assume that you will sell your old card for $60-$100 (about right for a used 9600), then that brings your budget close to $200. in which case I would suggest a GTX460, although thats really pushing your money and maybe you already factored that in. for just $120 though, I cant think of any significant improvements over a 9600 in Nvidia’s lineup. maybe an ATI fan has an idea for that.</p>
