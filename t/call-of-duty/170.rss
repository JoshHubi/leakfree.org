    <description>Anyone a fan of any of the Call Of Duty games? if so which ones? anyone else waiting for Modern Warfare 2? 

I&#39;d post the trailer to it but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth watching, waiting for a new one showing some gameplay.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Been playing CoD every since day 1, now have 5 years of modding experience - my best field is level design and scripting.</p>
<p>Got one mod running, check it out here:<br>
<a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/nuclear-apocalypse-uprising" data-bbcode="true" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.moddb.com/mods/nuclear-apocalypse-uprising</a></p>
<p>Love all the CoD games.</p>
<p>The strongest thing about CoD is simply because it is fast FPS action on small maps, high performance and an insanely huge replay factor.<br>
I have almost 2000 hours of multiplayer (CoD2) on Xfire, with many more when I had Xfire off.</p>
<p>As for the whining about the spawnsystem, it is not the devs fault…<br>
Why? Because the maps were designed for 16 to 32 players (that is the absolute max) but for some reason admins want 54+ slots so the spawnsystem is flooded and the game cannot find a spawnposition where the enemy is not in the spawns pov.<br>
Spawns are pre-made in the map thus the server cannot create ‘new’ spawns.</p>

It boils down to a “you win if you’re behind the enemy” game.<br>
I prefer the original Day of Defeat for my World-War fix.</p>

<p>Really? I enjoyed it. Each to his own I guess. Only problem is that multiplayer is dying. Non-mod servers with a manageable ping have decreased from 50 to 7 in the past 6 months. :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>Personally, I don’t see what’s so special about Call of Duty. Oh sure, there was a time where I did enjoy both Modern Warfare and World at War. But now, I look at my CoD loving friends as if they’re idiots. They pretty much jerk off everytime a new trailer’s released. Internet fourms and comments sections are not better. I simply want to enjoy a nice “Halo 3 Top 10 (Whatever),” but their’s always some retard that trolls “OMG halo sux cod iz so muz better it run 90 frames a second and u can shootz thru wallz lolz!!!”. So really, fuck them.<br>
Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be playing Return to Castle Wolfenstein, the true Nazi-hating WWII FPS franchise!</p>

<p>Technically there is no CoD5 yet, merely Call of Duty: World at War.</p>

<p>Yes. Upto 4 player. I don’t think you can play split-screen on 4 player.</p>
<p>As for vehicles - they annoy me <span class="bbcode-i">so</span> much.</p>

            <p>I like the first COD game (first game I was in a clan) and COD4, the two in between were good but nothing special. Never really played online since the first. If I started playing COD4 online, I’ll probably get hooked by what friends have said. :zip:</p>

            <p>The addition of vehicles isn’t that bad, its good in the ‘Roundhouse’ map. And the maps themselves are OK. Campain, I didn’t play in 5(I only used the advanced beta), so I can’t say.</p>
<p>But I do agree theres not that much different from COD4</p>

<p>I liked CoD2 and CoD4. Although the latter was a bit too short.</p>

<p>I must agree with you. It took me 4.4 hours to complete the game. On the second easisest difficulty though but still shorter. As an example, crysis is easier than cod for on delta then cod 4 is on the second easiest difficulty. And crysis took me longer to complete. Now that im done with my speech, fell free to post. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
