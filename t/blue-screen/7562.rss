    <description>Hey guys.
I have problem with Minecraft. After 15 or so minutes it either crashes and an error pops saying:&#39; ati display driver has stopped responding and has recovered&#39; and when I play Minecraft the second time I get a BSOD. This all started when I downloaded The Witcher 2. The game was lagging like shit so I downloaded the newest drivers. This didn&#39;t help at all and all my games started to crash so I removed all drivers with Driver Cleaner and again downloaded the newest drivers. Thankfully the problem was resolved with all of my games except Minecraft. I tried to download some older drivers but to no avail. I also tried removing Minecraft completely and installing it again and this too didn&#39;t help. Does someone know what the problem might be?

Specs:
- Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit
- ATI Radeon HD 4600 series
- AMD Athlon II X4 620 2,6 GHz
- 4096 MB RAM DDR3
- Gigabyte GA-MA77OT-UD3P</description>
