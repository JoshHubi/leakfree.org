    <title>It really lags. Uneven framrate</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/it-really-lags-uneven-framrate/14801</link>
    <description>I have very uneven framrate. I just stand and looking at wall and fps moves from 30-60 in 1 second. Is there fix for this or i can disable some not important options. Max settings. I didn&#39;t have it on free mod

            <p>Well, I’ll hope there will be more optimization. By the way, I keep playing, though, despite the lags. Thanks for replies</p>

<p>Yep, there are some things that can still be improved, performance wise, but these maps really push the limits anyway, so there isn’t <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">a lot</span></span> left to do about it unfortunately. Just imagine that they had to double the number of maximum edicts (I think this was it, it’s mentioned in the notes) in the engine due to them.</p>
<p>But you never know actually. At launch, Crossfire was poorly optimized as well, and was eventually fixed even though it just <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">cannot</span></span> be compared to these in any way.</p>

            <p>The new maps from STU are very hardware demanding due to how much content they use, I think that’s where you noticed these problems since you didn’t name any specific locations.</p>
<p>Chon stated in a thread I found somewhere on the community page of the game that there will be more attempts at optimization for these particular maps, but they don’t want to make significant changes to the maps (lower their quality, in all senses, only for the sake of performance), thus there will still be a performance hit, for that cost, for now. If I find the thread again I’ll leave a link here so you can see for yourself.</p>
<p>Beside these maps, there shouldn’t be other performance issues, the CU actually brought some more improvements in this area. You could try reducing some settings/turning off some features, particularly the godrays and CSM.</p>
<p>Update: Found the mentioned topic. Man, that was quite a search, took me a while to find it: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/364041776196562340/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/364041776196562340/</a></p>
