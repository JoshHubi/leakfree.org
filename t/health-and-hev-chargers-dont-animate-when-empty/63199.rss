    <title>Health and HEV chargers don&#39;t animate when empty</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/health-and-hev-chargers-dont-animate-when-empty/63199</link>
    <description>
I started playing again with the Steam release and could have sworn the Health charger had a little shutter that went down when empty. The HEV also used to close up when empty but that doesn&#39;t happen either.
The other animations appear to work.

Is this a known issue?
I&#39;m on Steam and no mods that would affect that.

Thanks</description>

            <p>I have not seen these shutters either and I also remember them from the mod.</p>
<p>I do not know if they were removed or whether this is a bug. I did notice one first aid charger that was already empty with the shutters down.</p>
