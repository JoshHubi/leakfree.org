            <p>I don’t have ESP or some shit, how do I know what’s going to happen? I’ve read about the Mayan prophecy (one of their gods is going to return) and I’ve read about all the other shit that’s predicted to go down in 2012 (precession, earth’s magnetic poles shifting, fusion experiments, peak solar storm activity, whatever else) and I’d say on balance that the odds of <span class="bbcode-i">something</span> significant happening before 2013 are far greater than the odds of nothing happening.</p>
<p>the evidence that what’s about the prediction of astronomical events?</p>

<p>If you based it on correct predictions of astronomical events made thousands of years in advance without the benefit of the telescope, not only would it become an accurate analogy, but also people might find your theory interesting in the same way they find Mayan prophecy interesting. Of course some would disagree that any transmogriphication would occur, but they might agree that it was an interesting date and something was likely to happen.</p>
<p>Mayan prophecy is based on precession - cycles of the earth’s axial tilt (think of the “wobble” of a spinning top). Mayans accurately predicted the earth’s tilt would bring the sun’s path through the rift in the milky way, something that happens once every 3,000 years or so. They believed this was a significant event - whether you do or not, or why you think it is or isn’t, is not relevant. It’s a fact that they predicted it, and it’s going to happen, regardless of interpretations of its significance.</p>

<p>I never saw it, it makes me too mad. Taking an interesting urban legend and turning it into a generic vaguely biblical disaster movie is such a shame.</p>

            <p>Yes, that was totally my point.</p>
<p>Wait, no it wasn’t.</p>
<p>My point was that assuming that the Mayans predicted anything is a thought that uses idiocy as a foundation, so no matter where your interpretation goes from there, it’s going to end up being stupid as fuck.</p>
<p>Also, the only time I’ll care if someone “Hijacks 2012” is if they’re historians commenting on how the Mayan calendar effected Mayan culture or blah blah blah. Because then at least some small area of dumb will be expunged.</p>
