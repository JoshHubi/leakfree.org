    <title>Photographing textures</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/photographing-textures/7469</link>
    <description>What kind of equipment would you recommend for taking pictures for game textures? Is a tripod really necessary, for example?

And by the way: What do you think about using these display protection films? Are they useful or just waste of money?


Thanks for answers!</description>

            <p>if possible, take your photos straight-on, completely perpendicular to your subject surface. Use a tripod with a level. Also, if you’re capturing tiling textures like bricks or…well…tile, you can save yourself some photoshop time by ‘squaring’ things up in frame when you take the photo. it sounds like some real derpy advice, but you’d be surprised how many textures i find that aren’t straight or taken at funky angles. You can often fix it with photoshop but i find it looks better if you just take a better shot to begin with.</p>
<p>By the way, i spelled “perpendicular” correctly on my first try. i’m so proud of myself.</p>

            <p>This^^</p>
<p>Also, try to take the pic as far away as possible… Zoomed in as much as possible while still being close enough to capture the texture.  (this will reduce the bend in the picture from the lens)… no digital zoom though… that just distorts the image.</p>
