If anyone has ever heard of Duke Nukem 3D : Reloaded, it was a remake of Duke3D in UE3 that was in the works after the devs received a non-commercial license from Gearbox. At it&#39;s current state, the single player was largely unfinished but the MP was pretty much ready for some sort of Public beta.

Now, here&#39;s the interesting part: The devs have put it on hold because Gearbox aren&#39;t allowing them to release anything until the next DLC for Duke Nukem Forever that has no announced release date is released. 


Are they really serious? I had respect for GBX, but DNF was total shit, and they are still trying to milk that game more when they haven&#39;t even fixed anything that was wrong with it? They really have to let DNF die. I don&#39;t even see how letting the team release stuff would hurt them - unless that teams shit is so much more professional than their stuff that it would put GBX to shame maybe?</description>

<p>Actually, what I understand from reading the fora is that the contract the Interceptor team (developer of Duke Nukem Reloaded) has signed with Gearbox (owner of the intellectual property of Duke Nukem) doesn’t say anything about a possibility of releasing the remake and that no guarantees have resulted from the talks between the two parties. And this uncertainty doesn’t justify precious time being spent on something that might not see a release at all.</p>
<p>I really hope it will get released one way or another…</p>

<p>Lol. Screw that. DNF is terrible, they’l milk it for as much as they can then they’l remake 3D themselves. Why risk all that extra cash on a MOD team?</p>

<p>That wasn’t the point of buying DNF. It wasn’t purchased so that they could fix the old DNF and have one great game. They bought it for future products that they could make themselves and bring Duke Nukem into the 21st century where he should have been for the last ten years. They only sold DNF as-is (with as many bugs polished as they could find in a short amount of time) so they could have some money to produce the newer titles they are going to make.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, while that might be true, it still doesn’t change the fact that they ADVERTISED it as such a better game then it turned out to be. Though I suppose that’s what you need to do to sell it. I guess them describing it like older games is what disappointed me when it was nothing like them.</p>
