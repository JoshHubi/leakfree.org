    <title>Some slow-paced FPS?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-slow-paced-fps/11075</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m tired of games that are so fast that you can&#39;t even take a look at the enviroment. Also I hate killing bunch of enemies at the same time, comming in hordes and in a restless way, because I can&#39;t even see what I&#39;m fighting. Also it gives me the nerves, and that&#39;s not something I want in a video game. So I just don&#39;t play games like COD or Battlefield(People say it&#39;s slowpaced but actually I find it the same shit as COD). So, could you recommend me some FPS that are more like Half Life? I mean, fighting less enemies, but harder. And with a good story and enviroment. Also I don&#39;t want something futuristic.</description>

            <p>I only really enjoy stealth games when I can kill people from range, like with a crossbow. Or if I can just move really fast.</p>

            <p>Whereas I managed 8 out of 10 missions with 100% stealth rating on Hard. Silly me, being all obsessive about my games XP</p>
<p>And if you think Chaos Theory is hard, just wait until you try the original Splinter Cell.</p>
<p>Knockouts can only happen from behind, and sometimes you have to hit them twice to make them go down. :fffuuu:</p>
<p>Plus, on consoles you don’t get save anywhere.</p>

I did rage quit though. Slow games are not my thing. Way too impatient.</p>

<p>You know, for all the shit people give to Halo, it actually has a very nice story, with some breathtaking and imaginative, fantastic environments. Like the ringworlds themselves, or Bungie’s take on future urban sprawls, particularly in Halo 2 and ODST.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think that’s more of this specific forum’s attitude rather than the general consensus.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s a very exploratory game series though (with the exception of ODST). The entirety of the gameplay is based around fighting. No puzzles or anything, and if you’re lost, there’s probably a nav-point to direct you exactly where you need to go, which is almost always another fight.</p>
<p>Not saying that’s a bad thing. It’s just a different style. But what I think really shines IMO is the story. It’s different from Half-Life though in that it’s played out via traditional cutscenes and vignettes rather than direct involvement.</p>

<p>Check out Borderlands 1… Borderlands is pretty cool, the first one is very underrated… a new Borderlands just came out. Also, you should check out RAGE. RAGE is very fun, and… you should really get DOOM 3 BFG Edition when it comes out… It’s a remake of DOOM 3, Ressurection of Evil, includes a 7 or 10 level expansion called “The Lost Missions” and features re-releases of DOOM 1 and 2 in widescreen… I liked old-school FPS games like DOOM, Quake, Wolfenstein, Unreal, and Half-Life for a reason… they were very fast-paced hardcore first-person shooters… but they also gave you a sense of immersion and you felt like you could explore a level… <em>sighs</em> that’s why I love Black Mesa!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Homefront is also not a bad game either. They even said the gameplay was supposed to mirror Half-Life 2’s style. I am assuming they meant as in not as bum rushed as Call of Duty is.

<p>Homefront was pretty underrated. I liked it, I just thought it needed a bit more polish and some extra length.</p>

<p>Probably a weird answer, but sometime after clearing the enemies you can kinda walk around and appreciate shit in the Halo series. I particularly enjoyed roaming around New Mombasa in ODST.</p>

<p>But a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> of games allow you to explore areas once you’ve cleared them, and it’s all too often not what you’re intended to do.</p>

            <p>Deux Ex: Human Revolutions. If you like a game with detail and you can explore, this is the game. Amazing game with an incredible amount of detail and storylines and places to explore. Stuff like posters, ebooks, computers to hack, secret places, etc.</p>

            <p>ODST was the best of the series, really. It kicked established series formula to the curb and tried something different, and was a ton more enjoyable for it.</p>

<p>I’ll second Metro 2033 and Singularity.  Metro 2033 might be exactly what you’re looking for, although it isn’t quite as good as Half-Life.  I would also recommend Fallout 3 and/or Fallout: New Vegas.  I’m playing both and having quite a bit of fun with them.  Bethesda games have pretty universally mediocre stories/story execution, in my opinion, but they’re an explorer’s wet dream: the worlds are huge, and you can have hours of fun just roaming around the world completely ignoring the quests.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I already played Metro 2033(I loved it). The problem with Fallout is that enemies are way too hard(not all of them, but at the ending) to kill and are pretty retarded. They don’t take cover, you must use the VATS(I don’t remember how it was spelled) to kill them and it gets tedious.</p>
