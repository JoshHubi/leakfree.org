    <title>Driver crash at Surface Tension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/driver-crash-at-surface-tension/10456</link>
    <description>One thing after another for me, huh? 

Anyways. Playing Surface Tension. Everything&#39;s fine. Grab the RPG and started fighting the Apache and BOOM. Outright freeze, I quickly Ctrl+Alt+Del out of the game to see it was a display driver crash that struck me. This always happens when I have a game running on DX9. 

So I suppose I have to ask. What can I do to help this not happen? I want to set it to DX8, but I see there&#39;s no support for it. Will this change in the Steam release?</description>
