    <description>I used to be a pretty big WoW player, and got pretty in to it. I enjoyed the game and spent a lot of time on it till Wrath of the Lich King, which ruined to game in my opinion. I&#39;ve seen that most MMO&#39;s that are out aren&#39;t very successful compared to WoW, and SW:ToR just looks like &quot;World of Star Wars&quot; to me. I&#39;ve seen a trailer for an upcoming Warhammer 40,000 MMO which looks really good to me, at least. I&#39;m just wondering if there are any MMOs that are out right now that are worth the money, because I&#39;d rather not wait 2-3 years for Dark Millennium Online.</description>

            <p>I’m started playing WOW 2 weeks ago and into it; But I can’t feel that the pace is slowing down even with the Quests, Dungeons, Battlegrounds, even getting insane amount of gold from a stack of 10 copper.</p>
<p>The two MMOs I’m interested in is Secret World and Dark Millennium, though I feel DM may feel a lot more drab than WOW. Given SW is set in modern times, I’m expecting a lot of pop culture references and easter eggs, mini games and basically go around like Buffy or Mulder</p>

            <p>I realize this thread hasn’t had a post in over a month, but I saw no point in making a new thread just for this.</p>
<p>New Guild Wars 2 trailer that came out last tuesday:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35BPhT-KI1E" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35BPhT-KI1E</a></p>
<p>Discuss.</p>
<p>Btw, Guild Wars 2 is still free to play, it is persistant rather than instanced, there is no phasing, it features havok physics, the game is fully voiced with the equivalent of 60 feature length movies worth of recorded dialogue (they claim that the demo gamescom features over 60 different voice actors and only represents a fraction of the game), and the purple dragon near the end of the trailer is not the main enemy of Guild Wars 2, he is a smaller, lesser servant of one of the main antagonists.</p>

            <p>Hmm Cata… well…</p>
<p>I am actually not quite sure what to make of it yet. Going over old ground never really seemed like a good idea to me as they did with Naxx at the beggining of WotLK. I can understand why they did that but still seems a bit of a let down. Maybe just becuase i had already seen it, again one reason i can understand why as many didnt. But to go over old ground now seems really silly as im sure atleast 98% have seen Deadmines. Ohh great Heroic Deadmines with 3 Pirates up. Im sure some of you will get that but some wont  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Graphics, well i guess i had hoped to see more than just an upgrade to the water, such as a more 3D armour instead of the painted on chest and legs they seem to have atm. Wont stop me enjoying the content though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p>The biggest problem though is the talents and the way they are itemising gear this time. My main atm is a warrior tank, and gearing it up/ choosing the right talents was part of the fun for me. The warrior/ any tank i guess, is by far the hardest to keep right especialy while gearing, making sure you still have Enough Health, Hit, Expertise, Dodge, Block, Parry and of course the Defence cap while maintaing enough threat points was fun. Now it seems they have gone for a silly system where you spend talents and… thats it, you can tank. I say tank is the hardest because any other class is pretty easy, just get hit/ expertise if melee and stack whatever you need to make your character hit hard or heal for more. Pretty easy to gear up most melee/ ranged and healing classes.</p>
<p>It cant be easy trying to balance that many classes for PvP and PvE content so i suppose they have to do something like this to make it right in both areas of the game.</p>
<p>I like the fact they are making it good for casual aswell but i wish they had kept atleast some degree of having to think about your gear choices in Cata. As said it was part of the fun of the game for me. Again aslong as the content and the NEW dungeons and raids are not copy paste bosses, have plenty of new boss abilities, i guess ill be ok with it.</p>
<p>Id like to see more guild focus though, such as the guild leveling. More focus on actual guild event type things. Guild housing would be nice, so that everyone has something to do… building it and the up-keep for instance. Guild Quests outdoors instead of just a boss kill would be nice too i guess. Not going to happen but we can hope.</p>
<p>Seems silly to worry about an expansion to a game, but there is just nothing out there at this time to compare to WoW (For me atleast) or keep my interest for very long. Ive played just about every MMO out there i can think of and have seen, but just keep coming back. I cant go play FPS online… im just to old and slow now(damn you kids and your cat like reactions), and of course the cheats in FPS just spoil it.</p>

<p>WoW is like some kind of virtual crack, it’s mind numbing and repetitive, but there’s something that keeps you coming back. For some people it has no effect and they quickly grow bored of it, others become addicted and it takes over their life. You might be able to give it up for months, but then a huge tempting rock comes along and you find yourself logging in again, play and discover all the new content which will last another year or so then get bored and quit.

<p>Usually. Perfect World, on the other hand, has always been F2P but they rake in some serious change from their cash shop. There were at least a few people I knew who had to be regularly dropping hundreds of dollars on the game, mostly on vanity items and rare mounts, while the average player probably spent $20-$50 a month just for items that are hard to play without. It’s funny because when you start out you think “cool, this is fun and I don’t have to pay anything!”, but then you get hooked and when you start leveling up you start needing those items, so you start buying even though you didn’t intend to. In the end they’re probably making more per user than a lot of paid MMOs.</p>

<p>I still prefer Runescape to a lot of the other MMO’s out there because you don’t really hear many people talking about it IRL, but everywhere else its WoW this and WoW that. It makes me sick honestly. That so many people waste their lives on that game. Runescape I can play and walk away from it. I don’t drag it into my everyday life. It seems to me that almost every single WoW player builds their life around the game.</p>

<p>I would say something about how I play Runescape and that, despite what many people say about it, its a really fun game, but that would just turn the whole thread into a massive flame war and invite trolls of every size, shape, and computer type to trash this post. Crap. I just mentioned Runescape, didn’t I? Sorry if this destroys your thread.</p>

</aside>
<p>this</p>
<p>Also Guild Wars was always free and they have released content for 4/5 years I think (free). The base of F2P is that they have more people playing which means more people bought the account and there are also a Game Shop where you can buy extras to your account. <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Sometimes</span></span> F2P = more income that P2P not sure if it could happen with WoW.</p>

</aside>
<p><a href="https://www.ddo.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Really?</a> Since it went F2P, it had 5 major updates with new content, big-ass overhaul on the whole game, and most importantly, opened 2 new servers since the existing ones weren’t nuff… Oh, and support, updates, servers all cost money, so you can’t say the new players are all just freeloaders. ^^ If anything, it was dead only before they went f2p.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not completely “free”, they are likely trying to put the same business model to LotRO, seeing the success.</p>
<p><em>edit</em><br>
Re-reading, it doesn’t make much of a sense what I just wrote. My point is, that it actually profited from going f2p, not just player-wise, but financially, a lot.</p>

<p>Yeah except as long as people keep paying for WoW they wont get rid of it, LOTR went free because not many people paid for it any more.</p>

<p>True that. I think that option is really far from getting true. Unless Blizzard creates another gold mine.</p>
