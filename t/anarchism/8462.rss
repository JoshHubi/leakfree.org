    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anarchism/8462</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been interested in anarchism for a while now and was wondering if anarchism could ever work in society. I know Spain was an anarchist country before World War 2 and that it worked well, until fascists took over. So what are your views and beliefs of anarchism? Do you think Anarchism could ever work for a long time or do you think it would eventually collapse?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Most people in this thread have appealed to some sort of ‘human nature’ and think that such an appeal requires no justification whatsoever.  Furthermore, I find little more annoying than someone claiming to be an anarchist but nevertheless will settle for ‘at least’ socialism, as if it is any better.  Not to pick on the OP specifically, especially since he is now ironically banned, as MANY people hold that position.  I say that as an idealistically anarcho-socialist (though that term is vary vague) myself.  Pragmatically, I like to think of myself as an ‘anarchist without adjectives’.  Watching anarcho-socialists/syndicalists bicker about their ideologies and claim that the other isn’t truly anarchist gets old fast.  I’m far more concerned with foundational anarchist principles, like the non-initiation of force (and/or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Non-Aggression Principle</a> [NAP]), than bickering about which economic system all ‘real’ anarchists must adhere to–as if I, as an anarchist, had any way to enforce something like that.  If I’m truly an anarchist and someone wants to be a capitalist, then how the hell can I stop them from doing so without asserting some sort of power over them?  I can’t–at least not until they start imposing themselves on others.  Capitalism does not <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to be imposing, though it can be and almost always is in today’s world.  The one requirement I do think is necessary for any sort of anarchy is a free-market, and a free-market in the specific sense that philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nozick" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Robert Nozick</a> framed it: “<span class="bbcode-i">Though the framework is libertarian and laissez-faire, individual communities within it need not be, and perhaps no community within it will choose to be so. Thus, the characteristics of the framework need not pervade the individual communities. In this laissez-faire system it could turn out that though they are permitted, there are no actually functioning ‘capitalist’ institutions; or that some communities have them and others don’t or some communities have some of them, or what you will.</span>”  While Robert Nozick wasn’t exactly an advocate for pure anarchy, he was an advocate for the “minimal state”.  I just happen to think that the proper “minimal state” is one that doesn’t exist at all.</p>
<p>As for why I do not like anarcho-capitalism, that’s because I do not think any anarchist society would exist very long under a profit driven system which only really emphasizes individual advancement.  All it takes is a few individuals, who ultimately only care about themselves, to group together, force their way to the top and keep others from getting there.  That is actually kind of what we have today from the way I see it.  Socialism, or state capitalism, just changes the make-up of the group that gets to be on top.  I don’t think this is because of human nature, though, as that would mean the problem is entirely unsolvable, which I doubt.  I certainly think it’s a very hard thing to fix, if not the hardest thing to ever fix, but I still think it’s fixable.  Furthermore, if you want governments to ever work decently, then this problem <span class="bbcode-i">needs</span> to be fixed.  The funny thing is, though, that if you fix the problem, you won’t need government.  I don’t think human nature is the problem.  I think the societal mindset that we’re all stuck in, myself included, is the problem.</p>
<p>As for why I identify as an anarchist and think that every form of government is bad, well that has a lot to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice_theory" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">public choice theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">regulatory capture</a>.  My overall objection to governments can be summed up rather well by this quote from Frank Herbert: “<span class="bbcode-i">All governments suffer a recurring problem: power attracts pathological personalities.  It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible.</span>”</p>

            <p>Labour really did fuck up this country quite a fair bit tbh. Their endless borrowing has come back to bite us in the ass majorly. They distanced themselves from the background Tory ‘friends in high places’ and in doing so have left us trying to gather back up allies, as labours have left us out to dry. The war in Iraq whilst I think was just in its end goal was sold to the public by lies. Labour became exactly what it set out not to, and in the end just became Tories without a backbone. Tony Blair needs shooting.</p>
<p>Not that I’m a tory lover by any stretch of the imagination, don’t get me started. Whilst LibDems don’t deserve the time or energy needed to hate on them properly.</p>

            <p>I agree with danielsangeo. Not left, nor right, but in the middle. We all know politicians are greedy liars, but, Labour are better than lib dems and torys… so uhh, vote labour, better of the 3 evils. xD That is if you live in England…</p>

            <p>Untill our most basic human functions subside every form of government will become corrupt to an extent. Socialism is in theory the best imo, however in practice human nature always screws it up.</p>

            <p>I think democracy is on the right lines, probably better than the rest (including anarchy), however we need to try something different with power a little more spread out. Either way there will always be wealth/money inequalities in society, there has to be.</p>

            <p>Well, <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> ideologies have flaws, and while anarchism could maybe work, it depends too much on people actually following it “properly”, like JeffMOD said. Most, if not all, of the problems with ideologies are human faults, not flaws in the actual ideology.</p>

            <p>The problem with Anarchism is that it just wouldn’t work, at least not for very long, because there will always be dicks who try to put themselves above others in one way or another. It’s a nice concept, but the true Anarchists who actually beleive in it as a philosophy are just too naive about human nature. It would be nice if we could all coexist without having to have enforced rules or laws, but we can’t.</p>

            <p>This belongs in Mass Dabate but whatever.</p>
<p>Anyways there will always be conflict between people (which leads to someone being in power and in control) with or without a government, anarchism is just another flawed ideology.</p>

            <p>Democracy is run by many. Monarchy is ruled by one. Oligarchy is run by a small group.</p>
<p>I feel as if emergence would take place in an anarchist society.</p>

            <p>Democracy = 1 person rules<br>
Anarchy = Nobody rules</p>
<p>If a society was full of nothing but anarchists, it would very soon collapse since there would be no laws to enforce. There would only be havoc.</p>

            <p>I’ve been interested in anarchism for a while now and was wondering if anarchism could ever work in society. I know Spain was an anarchist country before World War 2 and that it worked well, until fascists took over. So what are your views and beliefs of anarchism? Do you think Anarchism could ever work for a long time or do you think it would eventually collapse?</p>
