    <title>Black Mesa Sound Effects Copyright Question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-sound-effects-copyright-question/62315</link>
    <description>Hi. I noticed a thread on this forum mentioning that most of the sound effects in the game (bms_sounds_misc) were royalty free and that the license.txt mentioned a CC BY-NC license. I just wanted to clarify since my project is a bit different than the one mentioned in the post:
I&#39;m working on a project that involves making an underground facility in UE4, that would be controllable by users. They could run &quot;experiments&quot;, operate shipments, security, etc and control the facility&#39;s systems. I wanted to use some sounds from the black mesa files since they fit in perfectly. The game will be free to use, *but I will accept donations* if the user chooses to (this is all considering the project comes through with anything - it&#39;s very early in development).
My question is, am I okay to use some sound effects from the game files under this, would I need to not accept donations at all, am I not allowed to use the sound effects, etc?</description>

<p>If I recall correctly, the mod release was made with a Creative Commons license that allowed for non-commercial use with attribution, so if you’re sourcing from the mod, you should be in the clear as long as you credit the assets to Crowbar...</p>

<p>I’m not sure if this helps, I had a similar question some time ago for a Doom project I’m still working on, I’m not sure if it’s dependent on the source of the audio files since I have maybe a 0.2% comprehension of legal stuff.<br>
But this is a response I had on the issue regarding sound effects.</p>
