    <description>I started up hammer and it is in some weird mode where you move up and down by right clicking and dragging the mouse and turn by left clicking and dragging. I can&#39;t select any brushes either. How do I turn this off? I&#39;ve already tried rebooting Hammer with no luck.</description>

<p>Are you talking about movement in the 3D view? You are probably in ‘camera’ mode (the camera icon on the toolbar) - click on the arrow icon above it to return to ‘selection’ mode.</p>
<p>Holding down the space bar in 3D view also acts as a hotkey for camera mode - hold down space and move around with the mouse, and release to return to normal selection mode.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot, that worked. What threw me off was the camera icon was not selected and I was in select mode, but holding down space worked.</p>
<p>EDIT: got another problem, I frantically pressed keys trying to get hammer out of the camera mode and now acidently set myself in some mode where I can move and reshape objects in the 3d view. How do I turn this off?</p>
<p>EDIT <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> problem fixed itself.</p>
