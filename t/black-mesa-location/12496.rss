    <title>Black Mesa location?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-location/12496</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if this is the right forum for this. I would like to know where the 
Black Mesa executable is located. I am trying to program my mouse and I need to know.

Thanks in advance

            <p>make a new shortcut and call it Black Mesa, in the target box you put something like this:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\SteamApps&lt;&gt;\Source SDK Base 2007\hl2.exe -game “C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\SteamApps\SourceMods\BMS”</p>
<p>maybe not exactly like this but I made it work on my PC (can launch BM even if it’s not in Steam games list)</p>

            <p>Black Mesa doesn’t have it’s own executable. It runs off of the 2007 Base executable, which I believe is located steamapps%username%\Source SDK Base 2007.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that any changes you assign to that exe will likely transfer over to all of your Source mods as well, not just Black Mesa.</p>
