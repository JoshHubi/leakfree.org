    <title>Problem with GB space in my computer...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-with-gb-space-in-my-computer/7764</link>
    <description>Not sure where to post this, so I&#39;ll post it here. I&#39;m on windows 7 32-bit on Macbook Pro. Basically, my hard drive space keeps increasing and decreasing. Basically, everytime I check, it goes something like this: 7.10 GB---&gt;7.10 GB---&gt;7.08 GB. It goes at a rather fast rate. It drops to somewhere around 6 GB, then it starts increasing again. The only think I could think of is trying to uninstall the far cry demo. I was trying to delete it, and it said it couldn&#39;t be completed because it was open in &quot;farcry_demo&quot; or something like that. So, I opened it and tried to follow the path, but it was in hidden files, so I didn&#39;t bother. I clicked &quot;unzip&quot; (as that was required to run setup.exe&quot; and half-way through, I canceled it. I checked, and saw that my space was decreasing more and more everytime I checked. So, I shut down my computer, turned it on again, and see my space got back to what I assume is it&#39;s capacity it had. I deleted far_cry.msi in the temp folder in appdata, I think, and I could delete the game, finally. That didn&#39;t fix it though. One thing I tried doing is running CCleaner, but I didn&#39;t analyze. I also tried deleting my whole TEMP folder, but there was one file that windows said I have to verify or something. It was FXSAPIDDebugLogFile.txt. Thus, I left it alone. Any idea on what&#39;s going on and how to fix it?</description>

            <p>Not exactly on topic, but you might be able to save a couple of GB’s with this:<br>
<a href="https://blogs.technet.com/b/joscon/archive/2011/02/15/how-to-reclaim-space-after-applying-service-pack-1.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://blogs.technet.com/b/joscon/archive/2011/02/15/how-to-reclaim-space-after-applying-service-pack-1.aspx</a></p>
<p>basically:<br>
open a command prompt with right-click-&gt;Run as administrator</p>
<p>C:&gt;dism /online /cleanup-image /spsuperseded</p>
<p>This will make the SP1 update permanent, which means it can’t be reverted, which has the effect of clearing up at least 3 GB’s of space on the system.</p>
<p>That is, if your bootcamp install has the SP1 update installed…</p>

<p>The only reason I could think of would be that you have your hard drive to auto-defrag at a specific time and or certain day of the week.<br>
That also happens when your hard drive defrags, the space available would decrease and then a sudden increase at the end.</p>

<p>That makes sense. I wish I could increase the space, but i have bootcamp, so apparently, I have to re-install it to increase it, and I don’t quite know how to do that. Thanks for the explanation, guys.</p>

            <p>i think 7 defrags every wednesday by default</p>
<p>after a while all of your files will be already perfectly defragged so it won’t have to do much</p>

<p>About 3 hours later, it stopped, thankfully. End result, 9.80 GB. I would still really want to know what was going on though…I hope it wasn’t a virus.</p>
