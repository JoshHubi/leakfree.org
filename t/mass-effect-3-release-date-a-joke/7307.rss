    <title>Mass Effect 3 release date a joke</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mass-effect-3-release-date-a-joke/7307</link>
    <description>Originally, the release date was supposed to be november, I imagine to compete with the new elder scrolls game. Now on E3 the footage showed a few things.

1: There´s no difference in graphics compared to ME2, which, I don´t care about as I liked the game for the story. Point of this is that they didn´t have to work on the graphs engine.

2: There´s only a few new &quot;moves&quot; if you will, or changes to the gameplay, so again, not much work has been needed in that department.

3: Based on the last 2 points, it´s been essentially making the new scenarios, recording the voices, etc.

The game the showed at E3 looked pretty good in the sense of completion, granted they only showed a few minutes of it but cutscenes where there, weapons where there, essentially, it seemed quite far in development. 

So why delay the game 4 months right under 2 months after the trailer said november?

Maybe I´m missing something but I don´t get it, as they said in the gametrailers live feed of E3, while a lot of people want to play E3 to see how the saga ends, a lot are getting fed up of waiting for something that has so many people working on that doesn´t seem it would take that long.

What are your thoughts on this?

PS: I´d like to clarify this is not a rant, just curious as to why it has happened.</description>

            <p>Actually, Med, they can modify the engine as much as they want.</p>
<p>Look at Mirror’s Edge, Borderlands or the new Medal of Honor SP for examples, they barely look like UE3 games.</p>
<p>Bioware just chose not to modify the base engine that much.</p>

<p>I don´t have a ps3, I played ME and ME2 on the PC. I figured I may be remembering ME2 better looking than it is, so I looked through google images, what can I say, I still don´t see that much of a difference aside from AA and stuff like that.</p>

            <p>I think a LOT of time will be spent on level/set design, and especially on making the ‘interactive cutscenes’ (in Half-Life or CoD: MW style) work. I read an interview on PC Gamer (or some site) where they gave an example of where you’re walking across a catwalk/bridge between 2 buildings and a huge explosion happens in the distance, but the shockwaves blow you off the bridge. As far as I know, Bioware haven’t done this sort of thing before, because they keep to the normal gameplay and cutscene divide, where all the big scripted stuff happens in cutscenes, but now they seem to be doing it in gameplay as well. And, Bioware being Bioware, they’re going to be perfectionists and make sure everything’s polished to bits.</p>

            <p>just because it might be the same engine and even if the graphics were somehow on the same level, doesn’t mean that it would take less time to develop the game, it could be the opposite, actually.</p>

            <p>They need more time to work on updating the gameplay (no its not the same as ME2, they’ve said that about a million times) and level design, set design, writing, enemy design etc. The game is delayed because they need more time to work on it. Move on.</p>
<p>Also who is getting fed up? Its two years for a game. Thats fully reasonable.</p>

            <p>You’re over thinking this, it’s probably just not done. There’s a lot more to making a game than the graphics. In fact, a lot of the games that are in development the longest use licensed or pre-existing engines.</p>
<p>I don’t think EA would delay a powerhouse game like this until after the holiday season just because they’re afraid of the competition. It wouldn’t be worth it.</p>

<p>3: Based on the last 2 points, it´s been essentially making the new scenarios, recording the voices, etc.</p>
<p>The game the showed at E3 looked pretty good in the sense of completion, granted they only showed a few minutes of it but cutscenes where there, weapons where there, essentially, it seemed quite far in development.</p>
<p>So why delay the game 4 months right under 2 months after the trailer said november?</p>
<p>Maybe I´m missing something but I don´t get it, as they said in the gametrailers live feed of E3, while a lot of people want to play E3 to see how the saga ends, a lot are getting fed up of waiting for something that has so many people working on that doesn´t seem it would take that long.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>PS: I´d like to clarify this is not a rant, just curious as to why it has happened.</p>
