            <p>While it’s not required to use the triple channel abilities some of the x58 chipset boards use for core i7, it does eliminate one of the VERY few reasons to buy the i7 920, over the i5 750. the only other real reason is the HT ability, which doesn’t really impact most people unless they really stress certain applications.<br>
If you can afford the 5870 power too you, but please tell me you have a high resolution monitor that will fully take advantage of that monstrous GPU power.<br>
Also, I would definitely suggest that you chose windows 7 over windows vista, as most of the problems people complain about with widnows 7 versus windows vista is easy to switch back to windows vista style…Windows XP isn’t something I would suggest to most people these days.</p>

<p>wait, hope you haven’t ordered yet. You have a 4 gig ram kit there, but i7 uses triple channel. You need a 6 gig ddr3 kit.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The i7 doesn’t use exclusively triple channel.  You can use dual channel too.  So I don’t NEED a 6gig kit.  True, I’m not getting max potential out of it…  then again, will I ever?</p>
<p>And yes, I’ve already ordered it - so it’s a bit late, regardless.<br>
But thanks anyway.</p>

<p>Thanks Level.<br>
I’ve preordered W7 now.  There is so much on the net as to go XP vs Vista vs W7.  Everybody has an opinion, and they all conflict with each other.  Figured I’d go to the Source.  The BMSource, that is.</p>
<p>I’m going to leave after that pun…</p>

            <p>Everything came from Newegg, but they shipped my light stuff (DVD reader, OS, Mobo) in one shipment, and they shipped my heavier stuff (CPU, GPU, HDD, PSU, etc.) in another. They came only a day apart so it isn’t that bad.</p>
<p>EDIT: I was wondering if someone could help me with a problem I’ve been having with my new MSI R4890. I have everything plugged in, I can get video through it, and it’s fan is running, but it seems like the computer won’t recognize it. I installed ATI’s drivers and everything, but I still have a 1.0 in the graphics category in the Windows Vista test thing.</p>

<p>Order everything from the same store, you mean?<br>
That’d be madness! You’d be missing out on all the good discounts.</p>
