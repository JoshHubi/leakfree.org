    <title>CRASH WHEN LOADING NEXT MAP</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-when-loading-next-map/10721</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t exactly know which map is giving me problems, but i remember it&#39;s after you solve the tram puzzles, after going all the way up with the tram, where here are 3 turrets waiting for you, when i continue down the tunnel and it begins loading a new map, the game crashes, black screen, and it says that &quot;it stopped working&quot;, i tried doing it again 3 times, but the same happens, attached the crash file.
help?
