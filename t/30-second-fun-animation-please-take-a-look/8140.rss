            <p>Thanks for the feedback. I just thought that this was a good place to share amongst people who know something when it comes to good quality 3D graphics.

            <p>I think a couple things that could really improve it is:</p>
<p>-If you gave your character a cane and made him walk all old and feebly. Then after he drinks the red bull he tosses the cane away and starts his little dance.<br>
-keep his hand and arm looking weak as he lifts the can of redbull to drink it. He should only get a lot of energy after he has already drank it, but in your current animation he gets a bunch of energy before he even starts to raise the can to his mouth.</p>
