    <title>El Eternauta</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/el-eternauta/6112</link>
    <description>The story begins with as a deadly snowfall covers Buenos Aires and the surrounding metropolitan area, wiping out most life in a few hours. Juan Salvo, along with a couple of friends (Favalli, Lucas and Polski who were playing truco at his house), his wife and his daughter remain safe from the lethal snowflakes thanks to the protection of Juan Salvo&#39;s home and the cleverness of Favalli. They soon get organized in order to survive the ordeal, making special suits to leave the house protected from the snow and gather supplies. During these trips they find Pablo, a twelve year-old boy, and realize that other, crazed or needy survivors have become as much of a threat as the deadly snow.

A few days into the snowfall they find out the true nature of the strange phenomenon: an extraterrestrial invasion to Earth, and get enlisted into an improvised resistance army to fight the invaders back. During this time, Salvo meets and befriends a few of his fellow enlisted soldiers, namely Franco, a lathe operator, and a journalist named Mosca. As the resistance marches towards the country&#39;s capital city they fight on different occasions against giant insects (cascarudos, &quot;beetles&quot;), a humanoid species with many more fingers than humans, especially on their right hands (Manos, &quot;Hands&quot;), giant elephantine beasts capable of knocking buildings down (&quot;Gurbos&quot;), and even fellow men who were captured (hombres-robot, &quot;robot-men&quot;). As it turns out, all of these beings are just pawns, remotely controlled through implants or fear devices by the real invaders, los Ellos (&quot;Them&quot;), also referred to as &quot;The Cosmic Hatred&quot;, who remain hidden, controlling everything from the distance.

After managing a few victories, the resistance is finally ambushed and reduced to just a few men, whereupon Juan Salvo decides to return to his wife and daughter intent on going into hiding. However, a passing ICBM (which doesn&#39;t detonate much to their surprise) convinces Favalli and Franco that a bigger, even global, war is starting and that they can&#39;t return empty-handed now, Salvo reluctantly agrees to join them. After the trio manages to land a heavy blow to the aliens&#39; HQ in Buenos Aires, taking down the &quot;anti-nukes field&quot;, they flee and Buenos Aires is later leveled by a nuclear warhead.

Eventually, the aliens lure the pockets of survivors throughout the country to &quot;snow-free zones&quot; as part of an elaborate ruse. Salvo&#39;s group is forced to split, and he tries to escape with his wife and daughter using one of the alien spaceships, but he accidentally triggers a time traveling apparatus in the craft. As a result, the three are lost in separate time dimensions known as &quot;continuums&quot;. Juan Salvo begins to travel through time seeking for them, eventually getting the name of Eternauta, a voyager of eternity.

I want to read this comic, but it has never been translated into English. And yes I did just lazily copy the wikipedia summary. I was going to post this in the Half-Life section on account of how much it reminds me of HL1 &amp; 2.</description>

            <p>It doesn’t feel THAT similar to Half-Life, mainly because Juan and Gordon are really different characters; and Juan is never seen by the other survivors as a leader, while Gordon is.</p>
<p>The key difference is that Gordon is almost always alone, while Juan is part of a bigger group that really feels like a community…</p>
<p>I guess I could translate it for you if you get me a pdf of the spanish version.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The story begins with as a deadly snowfall covers Buenos Aires and the surrounding metropolitan area, wiping out most life in a few hours. Juan Salvo, along with a couple of friends (Favalli, Lucas and Polski who were playing truco at his house), his wife and his daughter remain safe from the lethal snowflakes thanks to the protection of Juan Salvo’s home and the cleverness of Favalli. They soon get organized in order to survive the ordeal, making special suits to leave the house protected from the snow and gather supplies. During these trips they find Pablo, a twelve year-old boy, and realize that other, crazed or needy survivors have become as much of a threat as the deadly snow.</p>
<p>A few days into the snowfall they find out the true nature of the strange phenomenon: an extraterrestrial invasion to Earth, and get enlisted into an improvised resistance army to fight the invaders back. During this time, Salvo meets and befriends a few of his fellow enlisted soldiers, namely Franco, a lathe operator, and a journalist named Mosca. As the resistance marches towards the country’s capital city they fight on different occasions against giant insects (cascarudos, “beetles”), a humanoid species with many more fingers than humans, especially on their right hands (Manos, “Hands”), giant elephantine beasts capable of knocking buildings down (“Gurbos”), and even fellow men who were captured (hombres-robot, “robot-men”). As it turns out, all of these beings are just pawns, remotely controlled through implants or fear devices by the real invaders, los Ellos (“Them”), also referred to as “The Cosmic Hatred”, who remain hidden, controlling everything from the distance.</p>
<p>After managing a few victories, the resistance is finally ambushed and reduced to just a few men, whereupon Juan Salvo decides to return to his wife and daughter intent on going into hiding. However, a passing ICBM (which doesn’t detonate much to their surprise) convinces Favalli and Franco that a bigger, even global, war is starting and that they can’t return empty-handed now, Salvo reluctantly agrees to join them. After the trio manages to land a heavy blow to the aliens’ HQ in Buenos Aires, taking down the “anti-nukes field”, they flee and Buenos Aires is later leveled by a nuclear warhead.</p>
<p>Eventually, the aliens lure the pockets of survivors throughout the country to “snow-free zones” as part of an elaborate ruse. Salvo’s group is forced to split, and he tries to escape with his wife and daughter using one of the alien spaceships, but he accidentally triggers a time traveling apparatus in the craft. As a result, the three are lost in separate time dimensions known as “continuums”. Juan Salvo begins to travel through time seeking for them, eventually getting the name of Eternauta, a voyager of eternity.</p>

<p>I want to read this comic, but it has never been translated into English. And yes I did just lazily copy the wikipedia summary. I was going to post this in the Half-Life section on account of how much it reminds me of HL1 &amp; 2.</p>
