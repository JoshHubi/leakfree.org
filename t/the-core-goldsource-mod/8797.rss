    <title>The Core (GoldSource Mod)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-core-goldsource-mod/8797</link>
    <description>I know, I know.

Posting a link to a GoldSource mod, set in Black Mesa, in the forums for THE Black Mesa is pretty daft.

Still since this IS the show off thread, I figured I might as well mention what I&#39;ve been working on the last few years.

[url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-core&#39;]Clicky[/url]

I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts.

Note: We are still working in Gold Source because I&#39;m the project lead, having started the mod way back around 2007 and I&#39;ve never fully delved into Source modding.

Archie, the other mapper who has produced most of the incredible maps on display on MODDB, is very much experienced with Source however, so I will be moving on once The Core is released.  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

<p>Yeah making large mod’s takes a lot of time, and people don’t realise it so they think it is dead, e.g. Black Mesa It probably takes time to make media too, especially for a small team.</p>

<p>It’s not the time. It’s the fact that the developers had completely vanished from the face of earth. They had no forums where they could say they were still working and so on.</p>

<p>Yeah. Well, it’s primarily developed by Archie and myself. He’s a media college graduate who spends countless days and weeks on shoots, and I’m a web designer who gets about 3 hours to himself during the week.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>We’re getting there though. I guess that’s why I can sympathise with the BM team.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I really like the look of that. Keeps Half Lifes style nicely while updating it. Also, the way it’s dark and atmospheric but not just pitch black like a lot of mods do.</p>
<p>Will keep track of it!</p>
