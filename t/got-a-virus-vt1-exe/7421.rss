    <title>Got a Virus, VT1.exe</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/got-a-virus-vt1-exe/7421</link>
    <description>I think I might have a virus. After getting done with a game today, i noticed 2 ie windows opened. They both were spam. Shortly afterwards, itunes opened and started to d/l something called &#39;&#39;alter ego swimwear cashak sweater&#39;&#39;. I stopped that download and deleted that file. I was then convinced that i had a virus. I opened the task manager and noticed a process call VT1.exe. I looked it up online, and it said it was a virus. I&#39;m currently running a scan with avira. Has anyone else had this Virus? Can anyone offer any advice? This is the first time my computer has contracted a virus.
Btw, here is some links about the virus-

[url]https://www.prevx.com/filenames/2440959154935678157-X1/VT1.EXE.html[/url]
EDIT: Found files named VT0 and VT1 in appdata/local/temp. Deleted them. May or may not haved worked. Avira did not recognize them.</description>

            <p>I suggest doing it the hard way. Try to be in windows files and see, if there is something Suspicious. Try to look at the modify date of the suspicious file in Windows files. If so, try to delete it. If cant, terminate the process or delete thru the CMD.</p>

            <p>so back to the topic, a lot of times when you are infected, the anti spyware or anti virus cant find it cuz it is set to run in your processes once you boot your computer.  You need to make sure the process is killed first so that your anti spyware anti virus can find it. SO,  I would suggest using this tool to kill any bad processes going on.<br>

once you do that, you can then run your anti spyware or anti virus to have it find and kill the bugs.</p>
<p>At least that is where I would start.</p>

            <p>Do you usually visit sites that have ads and/or pop-ups? If so, I would recommend using Noscript when you do. Also, Swampfox<br>
