    <title>Special Moments in Games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/special-moments-in-games/3929</link>
    <description>We all have had them, the special moments in gaming. These includes anything, such as beating Nihilanth in Half-Life to finally get that specific weapon in Modern Warfare. It may be nostalgic or anything that makes you pissed at the game and you will always remember it for that reason.
So what can you remember which was special for [b][i]you[/i][/b]?
[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]This thread may include spoilers. [/SIZE]
There you have it  :wink: 




I have a couple which includes :

[i][b]Super Mario Galaxy[/b][/i] - Bowser&#39;s Star Reactor, hearing this awesome tune of Koopa&#39;s Road from Super Mario 64 gave me a tear.

[i][b]The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess[/b][/i] - When you first enter Temple of Time and hear the classic tune from Ocarina of Time. Satisfying!

[i][b]Super Ghouls and Ghosts[/b][/i] - When you finally complete all the levels and are at the doorstep to the final boss : &quot;Go back and get the sheild/amulet(Can&#39;t remember what it was)&quot;. And you have to start all over again...I was sooooo pissed at the game and have never played it since then. Damn you Capcom for making such a hard game!!

[i][b]Secret of Mana[/b][/i] - When the game is closing in and you defeat the final boss, you never had a chance to say goodbye to the Sprite child. A little sad, but I still remember it.

[i][b]F-Zero GX[/b][/i] - When you finally complete the Final Mission on Story Mode, Falcon takes his helmet off... and credits starts to roll...Was that it? Pissed me off a little.

[b][i]Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots[/i][/b] - The Return to Shadow Moses Island, when you first enter the Heliport and &quot;The Best Is Yet To Come&quot; starts play. Such an epic moment for me. 

[i][b]God of War 3 [/b][/i]- The Ending, when Kratos takes suicide. I was left confused and a little sad. Such an epic game and a &quot;What the...&quot; ending.

[i][b]Gears of War 2[/b][/i] - The &quot;Final Boss&quot; Battle, this was somewhat a disappointment, such a great game with such an easy &quot;Final Boss&quot;</description>

            <p>Mass Effect 2: meeting Thane for the first time, actually</p>
<p>EDIT: scratch that, most epic moment in ME2 was starting up the game not actually knowing what to expect, never having played such a game before, playing for a bit and suddenly stumbling out of a door into space. The scenery was just breathtaking.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Actually I have two such moment in my game life. The first is from NFS most wanted. When I get BMW M3 GTR car at the first race reward. My friend told me I am lucky because the whole game is to get this car and I got it at the first round. And the another moment is I complete whole IGI-2 in one sitting and I feel like a solder.</p>

<p>That was the most half-assed horrible intro to a game ever. The game was fun to play but the story… I only have two words do that games story line. Wasted potential.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know the feeling. As I said I wasent sure if it was the worst or best ending ever. Bit one thigs positive because of it it totally was a downer ending that required the player to freek out and want more. Makes me so mad that when  Microsoft bought out rare they canceled the development of CBFD2. Rare publicly stated that if microsoft gave them the go ahead they would be all over it.</p>

            <p>the very first and last scene in conker’s bad fur day. I wasn’t sure it it was horrible or amazing when I first saw it. A game that was so humorous all of a sudden gets dark and serious. Making a perfect extension of the opening, completely tricking the player on the emotions that they thought they were perceiving.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</span>* First underground lab, seeing a box lift off the ground with nothing around.[indent]Man that was exciting.

Gunning down the first poltergeist was overwhelmingly satisfying, those invisible bastards suddenly became mortal.[/indent]</p>
