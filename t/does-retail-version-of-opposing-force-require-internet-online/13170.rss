    <description>What the title says.  I Googled but couldn&#39;t find the answer.  I&#39;m referring to the retail version of Opposing Force that was released as an expansion and the one that came with the Platinum edition, [i]not[/i] the Steam version or the one that comes with Anthology.</description>

<p>I think Steam may have existed at the time of Op4’s release…but if it did, it was pretty much solely restricted to Counter-Strike, if memory serves correctly. Sersoft’s right though, Op4 should work offline. However, if you have the hard copy, that works just as well. No problem by the way haha anytime.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Steam came out in 2003 and Opposing Force initially came out in 1999 and in the Platinum edition, it was 2002 so the retail version should predate Steam.  But, I was still wondering if OP disc/retail version needed Internet to play (or activate).</p>
<p>Oh, and when I try to run OP (Steam version) in offline mode, it gives me a window mentioning something about syncing it with Steam servers but it still has a button that says “Play Game” but when I click it, nothing happens.  The reason I even tried it in offline mode was because I noticed when I start the game up it mentions connecting to servers.  This was not just the initial time but every time I start it up as if it’s meant to have a connection to at the very least start the game.</p>
