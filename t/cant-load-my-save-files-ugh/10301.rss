    <title>Can&#39;t load my save files ugh...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-load-my-save-files-ugh/10301</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been bashing my head for a day already, and I can&#39;t quite find the solution to this annoying problem. I&#39;ve started the game like 5 times already (there is no actual place where the lag happens - it just happens) and when the game eventually hangs I have to kill the process in the task manager. But when I try to start the game again with my save files that have been created the just hangs again and the process sometimes is unkillable. This is so frustrating as I&#39;m trying to make a &#39;&#39;lets play&#39;&#39; and the game just crashes and won&#39;t load...

the specs are as follows:
Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 2.4 @ 3.2 (356x9) 1.325v
Motherboard: Gigabyte EP45C-DS3R
Video Card: Sapphire HD 5870 1GB GDDR5
RAM: 2x2GB DDR2 667 MHZ PC5300 + 2x1 GB 800 MHz (Total 6GB)
Power Supply: Corsair TX650
Operating system: Se7en SP1 x64
Monitor: Samsung SyncMaster T200 20&quot;
HDD: 750 GB Hitachi SATA2</description>

            <p>I have a similar problem, somewhat…</p>
<p>I can load BMS and it will run fine. I played for a bit the other night and made it up to the Office Complex. But, I quit the game and came back to play the next day and now BMS won’t load any of my saved games. I tried to just start a new game and hit “F9” (I think that’s quickload) but BMS just froze at that point.</p>
<p>Any help would be awesome!</p>
