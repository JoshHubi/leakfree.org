<p>Wrong.  Both Koran and Qu’ran are used widely.  I just didn’t feel like writing Qu’ran at the moment, so I opted for the easiest way to write it and convey the same meaning.</p>

<p>Religion is another demographic that violent people use as an excuse to fight. Football is another good example, merely supporting another team is enough for a bar room brawl. Religion is could be said to be more dangerous though, as it can be used as justification for questionable actions.</p>

<p>Once at school, we had to do some silly form about something or other, that required ethnic and religious backgrounds, thus I wrote down I was atheist, prompting the teacher to ask “What don’t you like about religion then?”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s the other thing about the perceptions of atheism that I dislike.  Atheism != Anti-religion (antitheist).  You can certainly be anti-religion while still being a member of a religion.  For example, you can be a Christian (believe in God and Jesus is the way to salvation, etc) and be fully against Islam and think every member of the religion should either be converted to the ‘correct religion’ or killed (extremist).  And vice versa.</p>
<p>Are there antitheist atheists?  You bet your sweet bippy.  But those atheists’ antitheism has as much to do with atheism as their hair color or which hand they write with.  Myself, I’m an agnostic atheist.  I don’t know and I don’t believe.  If you want to believe, more power to you.  Want me to believe?  You’ve got your work cut out for ya.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>So literally thousands of Christians burning women at the stake for <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">suspicions</span></span></span> of witchcraft isn’t utterly objectionable?</p>
<p>As stated above, the Catholic opposition to condoms spreading HIV, AIDS, and other STD’s, not to mention an unsustainable increase in world population?</p>
<p>I agree, extremist Jihadist groups are terrible, but in general Islam is a fairly peaceful religion, given a bad name by terrorists and Anti-Zionists like Ahmadeenajad (spellcheck). The point I was making was: whilst Jihadist groups are a threat, responsible for thousands of innocent lives, Christianity is far from blameless for the atrocities it has commited in the past.</p>
<p>See also, in addition to Witch trials, the Spanish Inquisition,  between the 2nd and 6th century thousands of pagan believers were slain, Charlemange had 4500 pagans beheaded in 782 for not converting.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a class="mention" href="/u/raw_bean">@Raw_Bean</a>, Summer Lightning is probably my favourite Hopback, but if you get the chance, try GFB (George’s Favourite Beer) which I beleive is only available on pump, Crop Circle (pump &amp; bottle) and Taiphoon (bottle only). Summer Lightning is also available in a 5 litre keg, DO LIKE.</p>

<p>I’d like to see you do it.<br>
Strange is very relative term. Western ideologies no doubt seem strange to Muslim countries.<br>
You obviously don’t know too much about Islam. Extremists just abuse the term Jihad as an excuse for what they do.</p>

<p>In basically the entire thread (exaggeration, in case you’re one of the people who don’t notice) people were presenting examples of how Catholics had done stupid shit some hundreds years ago, but nobody provided examples of how Muslims had done stupid shit some hundred years ago, which I then provided, and then I stated my opionon on posting one-sided bullshit.</p>
<p>And yes, I did read the thread.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, @ danielsangeo, I know what you mean. Once at school, we had to do some silly form about something or other, that required ethnic and religious backgrounds, thus I wrote down I was atheist, prompting the teacher to ask “What don’t you like about religion then?”, and other questions along that line, clearly unable to comprehend anyone not being religious (coincidentally, this gentleman was a devout Christian). I’ve heard atheists get an even tougher time in America though.</p>

</aside>
<p>Using 400+ years old examples in your arguments doesn’t help your case. Muslim countries has done exactly as much shit back then. As a matter of fact, do you know how Islam spread so quickly from country to country back when it started?</p>
<p>Through war. And thus the first crusade was initiated, as a response to the Islamic expansion when it had reached the Byzantine Empire (which where Orthodox Christians btw).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Extremist] Atheists (Not a religion, but neither is Confucianism) who would be happy to get rid of religion with force</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m an atheist and would like to quibble with a minor point here:</p>
<p>Extremist atheists, like extremist theists, seek to get rid of all religion that goes against them (extremist Christian seek to get rid of all Muslims, extremist Islam seek to get rid of all Christians).</p>
<p>However, this ‘get rid of’ thing has nothing to do with religion or atheism, however.  It is an “us versus them” thing inherent in all extremist viewpoints where “us=good” and “them=bad”, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Since this is a forum based upon Half Life, imagine if there was a Xenian who thought that all humans were animals to be destroyed or tested brutally, including Freeman.  That would be an extremist.  Inversely, imagine if there was a human that though all Xenians were the enemy.  That would be Gordon Frohman…err, an extremist.  And, if anyone helps “the enemy”, then they are no better than the enemy.</p>
<p>I just want to let it be known that atheism has nothing to do with the eradication of religion.  Atheism is simply the lack of belief in deities, nothing more; just like theism is simply the belief in deities, nothing more.  Too often, when I tell people that I’m an atheist, people automatically assume many things about me…many things that are bad.</p>
<p>And I like to nip that in the bud if I see it.</p>
