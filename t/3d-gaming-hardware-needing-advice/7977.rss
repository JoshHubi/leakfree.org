    <title>3D gaming hardware - needing advice</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/3d-gaming-hardware-needing-advice/7977</link>
    <description>Hey guys, coming to you today to ask for help regarding 3d technology in gaming. Actually - how it all works. 
I&#39;m looking into building new pc in some time and I wanted it to be able to run games in 3d. I thought that if I buy some 3d tv (planning to buy: 3D SONY BRAVIA 40&quot; KDL 40EX723 LED FULLHD) and some decent gpu (planning on buying Gigabyte Nvidia GTX570) it will be all flying as both devices are coming with hdmi 1.4a and both are &#39;3d ready&#39;. 
But now I&#39;ve just found out that built-in TV&#39;s 2d-3d conversion is not all the same as Nvidia 3d vision. I don&#39;t get it at all. And on top of that Nvidia is listing only a few screens compatible with their technology (Mitsubishi -.-). They also list their super-awesome glasses as REQUIRED. Does that mean that SONY TDG-BR250 -3D Active Shutter glasses simply won&#39;t work with their technology?

Can somebody explain me how on earth is all that shit suppoused to work all togather? It seems to me at the moment as if TV manufacturers and nvidia ignored each other.

Thanks in advance - I&#39;m desperate.. -.-</description>

            <p>Unfortunately it kinda is taking off.  Nvidia has good marketing.  And every fucktard in the movie industry seems to want to do it as well as every major tv manufacturer.</p>

            <p>I don’t think that 3D will take off until we don’t need glasses and can look at it from multiple angles (requiring, possibly a cube that sits in the middle of the room and you can look at the image from all sides).   As for 2D displays, the only way I know to make 3D without the use of glasses is via parallax; little geometric prisms or whatever that shoot two pictures at different angles.  The 3DS does this…poorly.</p>
<p>At the moment, 3D is a gimmick.  I’m not sure if it’ll ever rise beyond gimmick-status…unless there becomes some real world applications such as, I dunno, that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KPhqy7ZwHU" data-bbcode="true">holographic display they had in Iron Man 2</a> where the display can surround you and you can walk around it.</p>

            <p>It may look fine when your head is practically duct taped to a movie seat staring at an enormous movie screen. but I’d imagine that on a 24" LCD panel, as soon as you change your angle of vision the illusion would be totally ruined.</p>

<p>No. First 3D device was made 180 years ago (before photography!), but stereoscopic technology still sucks hard and I hate it, too :’(…  Anyway I can’t understand people who think that 3D is only a gimmick. Even dinosaurs had two eyes designed primarily for stereopsis - how can it be a gimmick?! It’s obvious that 3D WILL BE standard feature in the future because it has already happened with every other aspect of natural vision.</p>

            <p>Dude.  Dude, fuck 3d.  Bow to 120hz.  Get the 120hz monitor so you can actually use those extra frames.  EVERYTHING will be smoother.  You can do 3d on the offhand but personally, i couldn’t give less of a shit about 3d.</p>
<p>But if you really want to go for it, nvidia has a list of 3d certified displays on their website.  It WILL NOT work with anything other than those displays b/c most “3d” displays aren’t true 120hz or some other such shit.  Also, nvidia has the most mature 3d gaming solution, so if you do 3d, you can forget about AMD.</p>

<p>I hate this we don’t have “money” era we live in. It as if the world is run by the Ferengi now. What is money? What is cost of innovation/invention? Profits? Did the soviets look to the skies to increases their quarterly profits?</p>
<p>Don’t let a business crook tell you that we need to privatize governments and space exploration. Countries and cultures aren’t meant to run like business’s. Unless you’re soulless and seek only profits. It is clear in order to evolve, we will need a revolution.</p>
<p>/On topic. Don’t get 3d.</p>

            <p>I disagree with everyone else in hoping 3D is a fad.  I don’t see why 3D is bad.  Its just fine, I hope it comes down in price so I can afford it.  Sure you don’t value it enough to drop loads of money into it but no one is forcing you to.  No reason to hate it, once it becomes more mass market I’ll probably go for it for the same reason I like games to have good graphics.  It looks nice and adds to immersion.</p>

            <p>if you’ve ever seen a nintendo 3Ds or whatever they call it, or a 3D enabled android smartphone, you know that 3D is just an attempt to reboot that old fad that passed years ago in cinemas</p>
<p>until they do actual projection of a holographic object hovering several inches away from the screen, I say real 3D displays don’t exist</p>

            <p>As far as I know, most 3DTVs aren’t compatible with nvidia 3d or ati 3d (don’t quote me on this, but I can tell you that you do need to look into this). With ATi’s solution you do have a wider range of compatible 3d monitors and TVs, but from what I’ve heard, nvidias solution is easier to use and set up, and has better IQ. ymmv</p>

            <p>Well, I’m buying this stuff just because I wanted a decent TV and new pc (dx11 compatible and rockin’). Since it’s all 3d ready I thought to myself - why not? Anyway, thanks for words of advice…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>The tech is still evolving and the plan of action is to make 3D screens that don’t require glasses. However, right now there’s quite a few different 3D techniques with no real standard in sight.</p>
<p>But hopefully 3D is a fad that should be dying out soon.</p>
<p>Right?</p>

            <p>Hey guys, coming to you today to ask for help regarding 3d technology in gaming. Actually - how it all works.<br>
I’m looking into building new pc in some time and I wanted it to be able to run games in 3d. I thought that if I buy some 3d tv (planning to buy: 3D SONY BRAVIA 40" KDL 40EX723 LED FULLHD) and some decent gpu (planning on buying Gigabyte Nvidia GTX570) it will be all flying as both devices are coming with hdmi 1.4a and both are ‘3d ready’.<br>
But now I’ve just found out that built-in TV’s 2d-3d conversion is not all the same as Nvidia 3d vision. I don’t get it at all. And on top of that Nvidia is listing only a few screens compatible with their technology (Mitsubishi -.-). They also list their super-awesome glasses as REQUIRED. Does that mean that SONY TDG-BR250 -3D Active Shutter glasses simply won’t work with their technology?</p>
<p>Can somebody explain me how on earth is all that shit suppoused to work all togather? It seems to me at the moment as if TV manufacturers and nvidia ignored each other.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance - I’m desperate… -.-</p>
