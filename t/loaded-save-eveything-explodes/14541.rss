    <title>Loaded save, eveything explodes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/loaded-save-eveything-explodes/14541</link>
    <description>Hi,

When I start Black Mesa, after opening the lastest save I&#39;ve made (on bm_c2a5e), everything on the map explodes, the screen goes white and I die.
This didn&#39;t happend last time I played, the save was fine.
I think the postion of a prop was not saved correctly and it triggers the explosion of the building. The (little) problem is that I&#39;m currently at the entrance of the map, I didn&#39;t have visited the building yet.
This is not really disturbing for me, but I think reporting this glitch was required.

            <p>I tried loading a older save, and I didn’t get the bug.<br>
That’s right, the bug comes from the save. Something was not saved correctly and triggers the explosion.</p>

            <p>I’m not a developer but try this.<br>
Try to load a game before that one, then make a save again in the place where your save is now.Then try to reload that new save. See if you die again.If you do, it probably is a bug.<br>
But if you dont then some prop spawning was off by a millimeter.</p>
