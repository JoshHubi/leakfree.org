    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-optional-suggestions-to-increase-graphix/12451</link>
    <description>Hello, people-who-are-seeing-this-now!
I am &quot;DatGameh&quot; and I am a real fan of this project, but I&#39;d like to give some suggestions on what to add to the game to improve it&#39;s looks:

1. [b]Add a world-view model for the Freeman[/b]

        (Maybe) Everyone has seen the update of TF2 in which you can see your world model in first person by using the command, cl_first_person_uses_world_model (0/1) which allows the player to see &quot;realistic&quot; first person, and it is awesome. Add this to Black Mesa, and I promise you, people will think it will be awesome (but possibly buggy). If they do the command, they can always go to the options if you add it.

2. [b]When going to Xen, put a texture in front of the face that resembles a helmet that he is wearing[/b]

        I know you guys are working on the Xen World already, but I just want to suggest this so it will be more realistic-looking, just like most games (I am not sure if you can mod this into the Source engine, because I know nothing about how Source works when making a game). And if you could, depending on the player&#39;s health/Suit&#39;s power level, try adding cracks to the glass to just make it more cosmetically awesome.

3. [B]Try making the HUD more, umm... &quot;HUD&quot; looking (somewhat like BattleField 3)[B/]

        I don&#39;t mean to say that you need to do it, but this is optional right? So I am suggesting that the HUD should kinda be &#39;forward facing like a tunnel&#39; to make it realistic, because basically, the HUD shown is actually coming from the helmet/suit that he is wearing right? so probably the display is not perfectly flat like in-game. And because the suit/helmet is basically moving more than the head because of body movements, try making it shaky

Well, that is all the suggestions I can think of, for now. So I hope you read this topic and try to improve the graphics and make it look great!

                                                              From, DatGameh
P.S. If you&#39;d like to give a little more suggestions, you can freely post yours in here ^_^</description>

            <p>I read a fic somewhere where Gordon’s HEV suit connected with his nervous system AND had a forcefield of sorts. Which is why we can see the hud without a helmet AND why we can survive headshots/headcrabs/etc.</p>
<p>I too think that’s what’s happening, and that’s why I don’t think Gordon needs a helmet.</p>

            <p>Freeman is shown without helmet on concept arts just for the marketing reasons (it looks cooler) do you think he went without a helmet in radioactive zones like toxic pools in Blast Pit or the toxic tunnel in HL2? Alyx even said that his suit would protect him from Citadel Core’s radiation, while she can’t go there because she doesn’t have a suit. It’s obvious that he’s wearing a helmet, at least in cases when it’s absolutely necessary. It may be similar to Dead Space suit, with foldable helmet that Gordon disables when talking with friendlies in a safe zone.</p>

            <p>Hello, people-who-are-seeing-this-now!<br>
I am “DatGameh” and I am a real fan of this project, but I’d like to give some suggestions on what to add to the game to improve it’s looks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Add a world-view model for the Freeman</span></p>
<pre><code> (Maybe) Everyone has seen the update of TF2 in which you can see your world model in first person by using the command, cl_first_person_uses_world_model (0/1) which allows the player to see "realistic" first person, and it is awesome. Add this to Black Mesa, and I promise you, people will think it will be awesome (but possibly buggy). If they do the command, they can always go to the options if you add it.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">When going to Xen, put a texture in front of the face that resembles a helmet that he is wearing</span></p>
<pre><code> I know you guys are working on the Xen World already, but I just want to suggest this so it will be more realistic-looking, just like most games (I am not sure if you can mod this into the Source engine, because I know nothing about how Source works when making a game). And if you could, depending on the player's health/Suit's power level, try adding cracks to the glass to just make it more cosmetically awesome.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>[B]Try making the HUD more, umm… “HUD” looking (somewhat like BattleField 3)[B/]</p>
<pre><code> I don't mean to say that you need to do it, but this is optional right? So I am suggesting that the HUD should kinda be 'forward facing like a tunnel' to make it realistic, because basically, the HUD shown is actually coming from the helmet/suit that he is wearing right? so probably the display is not perfectly flat like in-game. And because the suit/helmet is basically moving more than the head because of body movements, try making it shaky
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, that is all the suggestions I can think of, for now. So I hope you read this topic and try to improve the graphics and make it look great!</p>
<pre><code>                                                          From, DatGameh
</code></pre>
<p>P.S. If you’d like to give a little more suggestions, you can freely post yours in here <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
