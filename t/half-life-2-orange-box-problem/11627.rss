    <title>Half Life 2 Orange Box problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-2-orange-box-problem/11627</link>
    <description>Hello. I have problem w with HL2. 

I&#39;m in chapter 1, when I want to go through the doors after I went by ladder at square and passed next to two men which were spoke about OC raid on homes. 

Before the doors there are 2 OC standing at doors (when you look on them the doors I&#39;m talking about are by left side). I enter this room (hallway) and near doors are. After opening there schould be a LOADING. But my game just crash to MAIN MENU to selecting chapter window.... 

In simple words - game crashed to main menu when LOADING.

I don&#39;t know what to do, no idea what&#39;s the reason of that. 

EDIT:

Ok, I fixed it myself. As always&lt;3 I&#39;m just loving it to solve problems.

Cheers.

And sorry for my english, it&#39;s not my main language.</description>

            <p>Try to verify the integrity of your game on Steam (right click on the game in Steam, choose properties, and select the option) if you want to run it with Steam.</p>

            <p>You always make Steam check your game files when such errors occur. That’s what I did with RO2 when it got messed up. Works with every Steam game.</p>
