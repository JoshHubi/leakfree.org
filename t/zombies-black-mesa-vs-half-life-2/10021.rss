    <title>Zombies: Black Mesa vs Half Life 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/zombies-black-mesa-vs-half-life-2/10021</link>
    <description>Alright so the zombie models from black Mesa are pretty damn sweet.. (everything in the game is actually Sweet, good job on that DEV&#39;s)

now i&#39;ve always asked myself this question: Do i have to take the Zombies from Half life 2 serious, and be afraid of them?
i asked myself this question because the Half Life 2 zombies are so...colorful...almost cartoony.. even their organs are VERY colorful/cartoony..to me they look more like slow colorful target practices, then a real scary threat.
if you look at Black Mesa&#39;s zombies they are just Dark...and decayed, the sounds they make are much better aswel and their bodyparts are properly bloody, rotting etc..also killing them with the crowbar is harder then in HL2.
The Half Life 2 zombies are just..way to red and colorful...covered in a unrealistic color blood and their yellow organs O_o..and very easy to kill even without ammo.

PS: specially love the Guard zombies in Black mesa.

So, what do you guys think about this?</description>

            <p>I actually wouldn’t mind if they updated the zombies to be a lot faster. Sure they look cool and all, but fear them? Every zombie you meet in the game you can just shoot in the head with a pistol. They simply aren’t a challenge to fight against at all. Now if they ran and charged at you like the ravenholm zombies that would be scary. I feel like in the later parts of the game their should be harder zombies.</p>

            <p>Oh don’t get me wrong the HL2 zombies were not bad…just i couldn’t take them serious for some reason, i guess its because of all the bright colors…<br>
Another thing: all the zombies in HL2 still have a human voice, they all still scream GOD HELP ME when they are on fire, it WOULD sound freaky to hear if only a few rare of them having that voice, just to give that disturbing feeling of: oh shit that zombie still had some humanity left in him… but they kinda overused it…</p>
<p>another thing: (black mesa included)<br>
Headcrabs seems to take a liking to Male hosts…i haven’t seen a female zombie so far in the Half Life Universe xD</p>
<p>Anyways back on topic: i like it that Black mesa didn’t use, or copy the screaming zombie voice from HL2, now the zombies just sounds proper dead and are just growling and all… another thing i like: when you don’t aggro the guard zombies, some of them are banging their heads against the window that’s quite neat!</p>

            <p>I like the Half-Life 1/Black Mesa zombies much better. In Half-Life 2, their outfits were unfitting, they should have wore blue citizen outfits I think, and second, they look like they are caring a baby with that hands. But they are pretty creepy too. But Black Mesa’s zombies were much better imo.</p>

            <p>I could never stop hearing “YABBA MY ICING!” after seeing “Idiots of Gmod” (I think that’s where it’s from). The new zombies are just so much more disturbing. It would be awesome if someone figured out how to bring elements from BM to HL2. Like the HUD, weapons, and some enemies maybe even incorporating Houndeyes and other missing Xen creatures. “Black Mesa: Half Life 2”  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I thought crowbarring them was difficult too, until I realized that the trick is to strafe while doing it to avoid their slashes.</p>
<p>Whack + strafe, back, avoid counterattack, whack again.</p>

            <p>the graphics in this are fine, i just hate how its now near impossible to melee them with the crowbar go back and attack again. same goes for the alien dog thingys. in fact the crowbars almost only useful now for head crabs.</p>
<p>anyway they are way more gorey than HL2s which i do love</p>

            <p>Yeah I agree with you, the HL2 zombies were really bad in my opinion… In HL1, they were actually scary, with more blood and gore even though the graphics were limited, and somehow in HL2 they were all dry and colorful as you say.</p>
<p>I’m very glad that Black Mesa brought the creepy, real zombies back, with all the blood and gore! And the sounds! The HL2 sounds sucked, the BM sounds are absolutely amazing…</p>
