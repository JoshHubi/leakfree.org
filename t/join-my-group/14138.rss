            <p>Sounds interessting but i have not seen any competition in BM so far… I hope the BM gameplay will be adjusted to make the game more competitive (more teamplay focussed maps, more balanced weapons, more advanced movement, good and working voting-system… etc.) in future… I also hope there will be some leagues then. Might also join your group… Because… Why not. If somebody here has a HL1 or BM clan who wants to compete, feel free to add me in steam (find me in the steamgroup) and we can play a fun clan match.</p>
