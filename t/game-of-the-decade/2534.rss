            <p>Look’s like many of you have beaten me to it but<br>
Half Life 2, if Portal was longer it could have beaten it.<br>
Left 4 Dead is third (second one doesn’t compare in my opinion).</p>

<p>I hardly think genres like Platformer deserve a category, considering how few of them even exist. Plus, where is strategy? Furthermore, favorite console isn’t really a fair question, gaming platform would be better.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>OK added a few more questions and modifed the “console” question to hopefully make it even more intresting then it was the last time… lol As for platformers theres been a fair few, be it some are unheard of most the time, take for example, Banjo Tooie, Sonic Rush, Banjo Kazooie - Nuts &amp; Bolts, Braid, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Sunshine, New Super Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Crash The Wraith Of Cortex, Crash Twinsainty</p>
<p>Oh I also took your vote for your best platformer and put it in the adventure genre, hope you don’t mind, I thought Mirrors Edge more adventure/action</p>

<p>I can, to some extent, understand polls like “What is the best FPS of last 5 years” But asking people to chose the best game (from over a dozen different genres) is immature.</p>

            <p>Choosing between Dragon Age Origins and Half-Life 2 and WarCraft 3 and Braid is like choosing between Sex, Friends, Cars, Money and Movies. In the end, if you are only getting one of those, you become sick of it. The right mix of all those (and more) is needed for greatest enjoyment.</p>
<p>I can, to some extent, understand polls like “What is the best FPS of last 5 years” But asking people to chose the best game (from over a dozen different genres) is immature.</p>

<p>You now realize that the decade doesn’t end until 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>theres much debate over this but to me we’ve gone from 0 to 1, that says to me new decade, same as it was when we hit the millenium, the nintenies, eighties, seventies etc. Would you call 1970 the sixties?</p>

</aside>
<p>Problem is Black Mesa will come out this decade (2010-2019), not the past one.</p>
<p>So… we can say the dev team pushed the release a decade later</p>
