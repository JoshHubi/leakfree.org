    <title>Problem when changing Steam language [steam version]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-when-changing-steam-language-steam-version/13883</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working in the french translation team and testing french translation files. Using Steam in french, after the first start of Black Mesa, menu were all in french (I imagine that&#39;s the translations from HL2).
I wanted to see english subtitles, so I change my Steam language to english to display them.
Now the game is in full english and subtitles works but if I set Steam langage back to french, Black Mesa is still in english and french files don&#39;t work anymore. Quite a problem to work on translation  ! :whistling: 
Also, it would be nice to be able to select language directly in the Steam properties of the game instead of changing main Steam language.

Thank you ! Your work is awesome !


EDIT: Nevermind, the reason is the patch 0.0.1 which set English for all in-game UI. To Close.</description>

<p>About this. Is there any way to manually change the language of the game (to perform translations tests)?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, There is ! It requires some work, but it’s totally possible, I’ll post here what I sent to uneXpaX:</p>
<p>You will need a Program called GCFScape.</p>
<p>Before all the process below, make a <span class="bbcode-b">backup</span> of this files located at “steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bms”</p>
<p>bms_misc.vpk.sound.cache<br>
bms_misc_000.vpk<br>
bms_misc_dir.vpk</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the bms_misc_dir.vpk with GCF and extract all the folders to the desktop.</li>
<li>Create a folder on desktop called “bms_misc_dir” and move all the folders that you’ve extracted</li>
<li>Your folder tree should look like this:</li>
</ol>
<p>"bms_misc_dir<br>
cfg<br>
expressions<br>
media<br>
particles<br>
resource<br>
scenes<br>
scripts<br>
"</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>If it is correct, then open the resource folder and locate this files:</li>
</ol>
<p>closecaption_english<br>
gameui_english<br>
gameui_loading_screen<br>
bms_english<br>
bmsmp_english<br>
bootup_english</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Translate them as needed and stay with the extension “english” since you can’t add more languages.</li>
<li>STAY with the name of the files in english, you will only translate the internal contents of this files</li>
<li>For exemple, inside gameui_english:</li>
</ol>
<p>“lang”<br>
{<br>
“Language” “<span class="bbcode-b">English</span>”<br>
“Tokens”<br>
{<br>
“BMS_CampaignName_BMSCP1” “<span class="bbcode-i">TRANSLATE HERE TO YOUR LANGUAGE</span>”<br>
“BMS_Chapter1_Title” “<span class="bbcode-i">BLA BLA BLA TRANSLATE HERE</span>”</p>
<p>See the file structure ? you <span class="bbcode-b">MUST NOT</span> modify the “Language” input nor the keys to translations.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>When finished, make sure all the files are in the “bms_misc_dir\resource” as created before.</li>
<li>Open up your BMS installation folder, in this directory: “steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bin”</li>
<li>Drag and Drop the “bms_misc_dir” folder (the desktop one) to a program called “vpk.exe” at the <span class="bbcode-b">bin</span> dir.</li>
<li>It will create a bms_misc.vpk</li>
<li>When finished, delete the files:</li>
</ol>
<p>bms_misc.vpk.sound.cache<br>
bms_misc_000.vpk<br>
bms_misc_dir.vpk</p>
<p>Don’t forget to backup !!.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Paste the created bms_misc.vpk" where you deleted the above.</li>
<li>Run the game and test.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope it helps</p>
