    <title>bugs: Gargantua, rocket launcher and other</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bugs-gargantua-rocket-launcher-and-other/10927</link>
    <description>In the part when Gordon falls out of the ventilation on two marines and then appears Gargantua rushing behind Gordon, if you hide in [url=&#39;https://images.netbynet.ru/imgs/e85819874e8978b441002dcec25f1f7b.jpg&#39;]that corner[/url], there is a chance Gargantua will not attack you but become dancing.

The fixed rocket launcher with manual loading is hardly operating while crouching, don’t know is this a bug or not, cause tank can be easily brought down once the launcher is pointed on the tank. There is also funny bug I noticed while running around that rocket launcher: marines won’t open the door until someone of them (or tank) will notice me by sight through the breach on the wall. I can just close the door and forbid opening it from the other side until hear ‘Greek-letter-sector-clear-over’–since then soldiers lost me and I can mine the door with laser tripmines and sleep well. 

There is no biting worms in the waters. Nowhere!

Tau cannon (wonderful thing, my preference) does ricochets when shooting on marines behind security jeeps (view from the left on the car, shooting above/near the bumper, argh) and some other stuff. I suppose it’s because there is still model where I see air. Tau cannon also does beautiful pictures when the beam is reflected two or more times, [u]and it was never used in the game[/u]. Shame on you! 
But why Tau cannon doing ricochets when I’m shooting on plastic boxes with headcrabs, plastic crates etc.? I haven’t noticed it′s doing it everywhere and independently of the material, so why?

There on the map with two eggs full of snarks, in the water near garage with big ‘Labmda complex’ sign, is no battery for H.E.V. suit. [i]inb4 we placed enough at the start of the game[/i]

Houndeyes can be often meet in sleeping state.

On the level where you must power up the rocket engine to kill the Tentacle, when you go for the electric generator there was water on the floor and when generator is powered up that water was under voltage on the way back, and the player had to go some way back and do his way right under the ceil. Now all this terrible level can be easily done even on hard level, and that makes me sad. 

Sorry for my english.</description>

<p>That would be nice. Pure water reminds me mountain springs and makes me thirsty.</p>

            <p>The leeches in source are designed to keep the player from going in the water, so they kill you too fast and aren’t fun to deal with, the dev team said they might(don’t quote me on this) return in an update, but won’t deal any damage.</p>
