    <title>Fast Weapon Switch Doesn&#39;t Really Work !</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fast-weapon-switch-doesnt-really-work/13599</link>
    <description>if enabled, the weapons are switching on key press / mousewheel, however the hud icons still show up, and i have to use primary fire to make them disappear (or wait 2 seconds), witch effectively kills the whole idea of &quot;fast weapon switching&quot;... i do have a hud mod installed that changes the icons, witch you can find here:
[url]https://blackmesa.gamebanana.com/guis/29150[/url]
i&#39;m also using the reanimation pack:
[url]https://blackmesa.gamebanana.com/skins/126786[/url]
and it&#39;s retexture 1.4 pack
[url]https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa/addons/black-mesa-animation-revamp-retexture-v141[/url]
as for the hud files, the zip had a folder with hud files for vanilla BM and hud files for the reanimation pack, and a few extras, though i only used the &quot;revamp rimlighting&quot; one, witch really only changes lighting on the models, aside from that i only used the stuff that was in the &quot;animation revamp&quot; folder... any thoughts ? / how can i fix this ? / should i replace a few of the mod files with the default BM ones, or should i go back to the default hud files all together ?

Thanks  :smiley:</description>

<p>No, you don’t need to revert, it’s like that vanilla.</p>
<p>Fastwitch the function isn’t killed at all, it still works exactly as normal, only the weapon select is visible (but not necessary to interact with). That could be to aid in keeping those less familiar from getting lost in the multitude of weapons, or it could be a bug that needs fixing. But it still functions entirely normally.</p>

<p>oh yeah, i tested it a bit more just now, if i break out my pistol and click while the hud icons are still there it shoots normally… so, it works, though the hud always showing up seams a little strange to me, because when playing HL Source i was used to having no hud icons at all, lol, speaking about fast switching, there’s a thing where, say i have the mp5 out, in any other half-life game i have to push 3 twice to get to my shotgun, because it always selects the top weapon first, where as in BM i only have to push it once to get to the shotgun, because it always goes to the next available weapon (from the current one) instead of starting from the top one… any fix for that ? or is it just one of those things i’ll have to get used too ?</p>
