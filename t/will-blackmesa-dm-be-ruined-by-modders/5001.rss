    <title>Will Blackmesa DM be ruined by modders?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/will-blackmesa-dm-be-ruined-by-modders/5001</link>
    <description>Source and gldsrc&#39;s biggest advantage is also their biggest disadvantage when it comes to deathmatch; extremely easy customization leads to a flood of shitty modded servers running shitty custom made maps with a gig of shitty custom .wav files. This is such a problem that on HLDM and HL2DM it is no longer possible to find a server running good ol&#39; simple deathmatch on good ol&#39; commercially made maps. 
/rant

So my question is, when blackmesa is released do you think the dm mode be completely ruined by badly made maps running badly made mods that force you to dl gigs of absolutely useless .wav files?

This worries me a lot because if BlackemsaDM lives up to it&#39;s old counterpart it will be the best multiplayer ever made and it could be very easily ruined by bad modders.</description>

<p>Of course. Like any game on source, it will probably run just about any map with the .bsp extension.</p>
<p>Though, you must be some kind of a stupid person, if you want to play retail maps, join a server that plays them/runs with sv_pure 1. How hard is that!</p>
<p>I can go into HL2DM <span class="bbcode-i">right now </span> and join a server running with zero modification whatsoever, except I wouldn’t do that because I don’t hate custom maps or the Quake 3 announcer for some mysterious reason.</p>

<p>I know there’s a fair deal of hate towards the gravity gun in deathmatch at least, but just out of curiosity, would it help if there was a slight handicap? Possibly a slower rate of fire, or inability to sprint while holding props?</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s one of the things I always thinked, inability to sprint while holding props. Hell is not funny when a guy who has a freggin object of the size of a car is going after you while sprinting and using the object as shield at the same time he throws it to you…</p>

<p>Well, It can launch explosive barrels, among other things. To me it’s like a crossbow without a scope, and a larger variety of ammo, which it can also pull to you.</p>

<p>I know there’s a fair deal of hate towards the gravity gun in deathmatch at least, but just out of curiosity, would it help if there was a slight handicap? Possibly a slower rate of fire, or inability to sprint while holding props?</p>

            <p>The purpose of the Gravity Gun is to get players to use their surroundings to their advantage, not by taking cover or other orthodox means, but by sucking up shit and punting it at people with deadly force.</p>
<p>There’s a reason the only item in the Valve store pertaining to HL2DM is a t-shirt with a picture of man getting his head caved in by a flying toilet bowl. It’s iconic to the franchise.</p>

<p>If you hate the Gravity gun because the props do too much damage, then why is it you like the magnum? It does a ton of damage, is instant, can’t be caught or deflected, has a very long range, &amp; doesn’t obstruct your screen at all when using it. If anything, that sounds like the cheaper weapon.</p>

<p>More shitty grammar than spelling, but you get the idea.</p>
