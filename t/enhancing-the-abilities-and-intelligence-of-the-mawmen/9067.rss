    <title>Enhancing the Abilities and Intelligence of the Mawmen</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/enhancing-the-abilities-and-intelligence-of-the-mawmen/9067</link>
    <description>Note: Just in case your confused, Mawmen was the other word used to describe the Headcrabbed zombies.

I know that Mawmen are slow and are not supposed to be bright, but they&#39;re not completely stupid either. In the chapter, We Got Hostiles, they were smart enough to sneak through the vents and grab one of the Barnies. In the demo, Uplink, it&#39;s suggested that they were working with the Houndeyes to lure you towards them and to trigger a trap which boxed you in with them.

What if you enhanced the Mawmen&#39;s abilities, such as the ability to pick up wrenches and throwing them at you, the ability to climb a ladder and a rope, and the ability to crouch and climb through vents. Also, why not give them the ability to work with other Xen creatures to improve their efforts in trying to defeat you? They would still be slow and easy to kill, but I think some basic intelligence could be beneficial to the gameplay.</description>

            <p>I think we can leave this post rest in peace. There’s nothing else to say about enhancing the zombie skills, only silly commentaries about the name “Mawmen”.</p>

            <p>I just came here to say that the HL2 zombie’s cracked ribs are still an obvious graphic match to an open toothy mouth. It was 100% intentional, and saying they can’t be called mawmen because it’s not actually a mouth is fucking ridiculous. Houdeyes aren’t  dogs. Dogs have eyes anyway, how is that name even special? A Bullsquid isn’t an actual bull with a squid. This applies to everything. A monkey wrench isn’t an actual monkey. Most pencils use graphite, yet people still refer to the core as lead. My Achilles tendon isn’t actually Achilles’s tendon. My name isn’t Achilles.</p>

            <p>While your suggestion may not make it in I’m sure you’ll be satisfied with all the improvements the team has made to the AI.<br>
As for the name Mawmen, while it does sound cool, if I were to see one of those things lumbering towards me I’d be more likely to characterize it based on its behaviour than its open chest. And then gtfo screaming of course.<br>
We call it a zombie because it most closely resembles, well… a zombie.<br>
We want our language to be effective and easily understood, and that happens most when we call a shovel a spade.<br>
:brow:<br>
No wait, I did something wrong there…</p>

            <p>Thanks for the responses. I’m aware that it’s not possible to integrate my suggestions for the zombie’s AI, especially at this stage. I didn’t want them to be on par with the smarter enemies, but I did want some neat additions to their behavior. It’s a never bad thing to ask, even if what I ask is not programmable.</p>
<p>Mawman may be a stupid name for some, but at least it is more original than zombie, and I like the name better. From the first HL, I always got the feeling that was more going on in the headcrabbed-head of the zombie than a traditional. They’re not as smart or quick as their other Xenian counterparts, but they are eerie in their behavior just the same. (I would say that their chest has become a mouth, and not just a hollow spot with broken ribs. It’s a better way to nourish itself than stuff flesh into a headcrabbed-head that’s already sucking on something).</p>
<p>It’s true that Headcrabs get along mainly with their own kind, and that Bullsquids are hostile to Crabs. However, in the Uplink demo (I know it’s not canon, but I still like how Valve set the situation up), you had Houndeyes and Zombies working together to trap and rush you. We never got to see any of that in the main game, but I still found it one of most impressive parts of the demo.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for considering and discussing my suggestion.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Also, why not give them the ability to work with other Xen creatures to improve their efforts in trying to defeat you? They would still be slow and easy to kill, but I think some basic intelligence could be beneficial to the gameplay.</p>

<p>The Headcrabs are parasites guided by instincts. They only recognize their own race as friendly. The Headcrab’s maw structure is useful to attach to the victim’s nerves and control them, not to absorve their intelligence. They simply cooperated with some of the Xenians (only some as bullsquids still hunted them). The cause of this cooperation could be because of the Nihilanth control or that the headcrab’s maw structure is of no use against Vorts, Grunts, Controllers or other Xenian beings, yet they perfectly fit with human craneums. That made the headcrabs the perfect first invasion wave. Primitive beings that can only damage human beings.</p>

            <p>Here you go: <a href="https://www.wiki.blackmesasource.com/Zombie" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.wiki.blackmesasource.com/Zombie</a></p>
<p>May be outdated, but i doubt that they will have add abilities close to those you demand.<br>
Besides, what would be the point ? The Zombie is a standard enemy, he isn’t supposed to have a challenging way to fight him. For that you got the Vorts and AGrunts.<br>
I sppose for the “shocking moments” in vents the headcrab will be there, as in HL.<br>
I quite liked the idea of zombie torsos in vents, or maybe dark corners. Remember the one in Half Life 2 in chapter Follow Freeman where you get out of the sentry room ? That got me on my first playthrough.</p>
<p>The thing with zombies pulling npcs in vents and such are scripted events and i believe they are still included in BM (look at the videos on the zombie page in the wiki)</p>

            <p>They did in HL2 and, as far as I know, Black Mesa’s zombies share their AI, so I hope the prop-kicking behavior is still there.</p>

<p>I do hope that the zombies will be able to hit props and such.</p>

<p>As for your suggestions, most of the AI abilities you suggested aren’t even going to be possible for NPCs that are supposed to be intelligent, let alone zombies. Why not suggest letting them use guns while you’re at it? It’s easier to do than climb a rope.</p>

            <p>Note: Just in case your confused, Mawmen was the other word used to describe the Headcrabbed zombies.</p>
<p>I know that Mawmen are slow and are not supposed to be bright, but they’re not completely stupid either. In the chapter, We Got Hostiles, they were smart enough to sneak through the vents and grab one of the Barnies. In the demo, Uplink, it’s suggested that they were working with the Houndeyes to lure you towards them and to trigger a trap which boxed you in with them.</p>
<p>What if you enhanced the Mawmen’s abilities, such as the ability to pick up wrenches and throwing them at you, the ability to climb a ladder and a rope, and the ability to crouch and climb through vents. Also, why not give them the ability to work with other Xen creatures to improve their efforts in trying to defeat you? They would still be slow and easy to kill, but I think some basic intelligence could be beneficial to the gameplay.</p>
