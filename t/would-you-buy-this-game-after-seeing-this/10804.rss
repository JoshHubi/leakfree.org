<p>Sorry, I don’t like the way it was cut.  The cuts are too fast in general.</p>
<p>Why have a clip of the rocket as it takes of and then a few seconds later have an earlier clip of the rocket?  That makes no sense.  Plus it’s a 2 second clip which isn’t very clear at all.<br>
The OAR clip (which was pretty much the second cut) isn’t very clear either.  You hide behind the train for most of it.  It would be the same as having a few seconds of standing behind a box or a wall, which isn’t very interesting at all.<br>
As it goes on the cuts get faster and faster.  Any quicker and I might suffer a seizure!</p>
<p>I see what you’re trying to do, but fast MTV cutting is so 2009.  You need to ask yourself, “If the viewer cannot really see what’s going on, is it really working?”</p>
<p>Sure, I know that these bouncing blobs are Houndeyes, but would someone not familiar with the game?  With a series of 1 second cuts it’s hard to get a real look at what these green blobs are.</p>
<p>Slow it down and chose your shots more carefully.  What do they show, how do they show it, do they look exciting?..etc</p>

</aside>
<p>Agreed. Also, the subtitles are turned on, which takes away from the impression, and the fact that they appear in another language, other than what is being spoken, is unappealing.</p>

            <p>No offense but that trailer was pretty awful. No element of mystery, no reason why some guy is shooting tons of small monsters (usually all the same ones) with a small pistol, and why there is a old creep asking me to pay attention. It definitely doesn’t give BMS justice.<br>
(this is on the basis that I would have never played HL)</p>
<p>I like the original trailer much better:<br>

<p>No, but that has nothing to do with the video. I don’t buy games based on trailers. When I’ve broken that rule, I’ve always been burned. That trailer would make me interested enough to track down a gameplay video of the game, though. Possibly track down a demo or find a friend who owns it so I can give it a try before buying.</p>
<p>Well, for $5 or $10 I might buy something just based on a trailer, but I happen to price Black Mesa at easily $20-$30, provided it’s complete. Oh, and like someone said before - with the missing bits of Surface Tension and On a Rail restored.</p>

            <p>i figure you mean whether someone would be tempted to buy those games as a result of seeing your trailers.</p>
<p>are you looking for feedback about the quality of them?</p>
<p>i don’t know if i would instantly buy them after seeing the trailers, but they would make me want to have a closer look at BM and HL2.</p>

<p>Black Mesa Source’s shortcomings are not apparent in the trailer, looks pretty good.</p>
