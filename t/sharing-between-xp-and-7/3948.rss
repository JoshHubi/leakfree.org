    <title>Sharing between XP and 7</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sharing-between-xp-and-7/3948</link>
    <description>I now have an extra desktop with XP Pro (SP3) installed on it. My main desktop has Windows 7.

I want to be able to access files (especially videos) from the Windows 7 machine on the XP machine.

They are in the same workgroup. In Windows 7 in Advanced sharing settings I have everything turned on except password protected sharing.

In Windows 7, I can&#39;t see the XP machine in Networks, and I can&#39;t access the shared folders in the Windows 7 machine from there.
In Windows XP I can see the Win7 machine, but I can&#39;t access the shared folders.


I have no idea how to fix this, so can anyone help me? Thanks.</description>

            <p>I think first of all you need set passwords for Administrator accounts on both computers.<br>
I’m on W7 Prof. right now and I can access shared drives (partitions) from other computers in network which are running XP Profesional. Important is to be in the same workgroup. At XP computer (under sharing) you need add full permissions for “Administrators” -&gt; folder (or drive).   [Add * Advanced * Find Now * ‘Administrators’ * ok * Set Full Access * and oukey]</p>
<p>When connecting from W7PC (it sounds almost like pubes nick) to shared drive (or folder)  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  trough network, use (XP) Admin’s username/password. //too much confusing I’m reading it again//</p>
<p>With my W7PC I had problems to access shared folders from “XP Home” friend’s Notebook - until I figured that I need boot in safemode to access Administrator account and set password for it (first experience with XP home)</p>
<p>Not sure if this help (sorry I have everything in czech language here so I hope I choosed proper translation. Whole post must sounds like a mess anyway :///</p>
<p>EDIT: On W7 machine - I can see that “Password Protect Sharing” turned off (under Advanced sharing settings) can bypas necessity of enabled Passwords for Admin accounts. I’ve never tried wohle thing in this way. I just know that without admin’s passwords enabled I’ve never succeed <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> At least with XP Home at other side.<br>
Anway we can go step by step each settings which can affect this on both computers (W7, XP) and let’s try (in future)* move it to the succesfull result ;o) I mean if you want. We have here basic network with router which refer…ing? DHCP adresses so bascly bsc network.</p>
<p>*That damn english stuck in learning progress thing. Anybody boring which want criticize my faults feel free to corrert me. I’d like to learn from my faux passes :zip: Oh wait no, it would mean re-writting my whole post:facepalm::facepalm::facepalm: myself :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>I have the same problem, if i find a solution, I will post what i did, maybe it could help.</p>
<p>EDIT: Ok, it might be stupid simple but after making sure the correct network configurations were made (same group name, password turned off, etc) rebooting both my systems did the trick. They both recognize each other and file sharing is possible. I realize it might not solve your problem but since it was similar to mine, it could work.</p>

            <p>I’ve already pinged, and it did work. I still can’t access my files though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And my IP addresses are dynamic as I connect to a wireless router. Changing my IP address would result in a loss of internet, if I’m not mistaken.</p>
<p>Edit: it seems to be working now, from the XP machine anyway. I still can’t access the XP machine or even the W7 machine itself through Networks for some reason, but at least I can now stream video to my XP machine.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the help, anyway  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>You have a XP and the W7. So basically both are from Microsoft, You can solve this problem very easily. You just connect your both System and go to the network connection and change your IP address and note it. Then go to another system and also change Its IP address. and note them. After that go to the command prompt and write the command “ping” with the IP address. If the reply come then you are connected.</p>

            <p>Obviously that’s one of the first things I did (different workgroup name though, but the same one on both machines). Didn’t work. I also deactivated my W7 firewall for testing purposes.</p>

            <p>if you want to see XP files in 7, go (on XP) into the Control Panel, Network Connections, click “Set up a home or small office network” next next next until you see workgroup, make sure it’s MSHOME then in the next menu enable file and printer sharing, after that choose just finish the wizard and reboot your PC. After that it should be visible from windows 7 if your firewall isn’t blocking the connection.</p>

            <p>This is doing my head in.</p>
<p>My XP machine doesn’t have a working DVD drive, so I can’t install W7 at the moment.<br>
The XP machine now shows up in the Network Map, but not even the W7 machine is showing in Network.</p>
<p>Both appear just fine on the XP machine, but I can’t access the files on the W7 machine. I also still can’t access the W7 files on W7 itself through Network.</p>
<p>I’m on a Work network, and everything is turned on in W7 except password protected sharing.</p>
<p>I haven’t found a single fix that works. God damn.</p>

            <p>If it’s like Vista, everything in the Win 7 machine that you want to share has to be under the Public folder.You then share the Public flder normally, and the XP machine should be able to get to those files.</p>
<p>In the other direction, I’ve never had an issue seeing Vista machines from XP, just make sure they are on the same workgroup. XP defaults to WORKGROUP, and Vista defaults to HOME, or something like that.</p>
<p>Another way to test is to UNC to the other machine.</p>
<p>Click on start, then run, and type in “\[computername]” without the quotes. It should bring up a list of the available shared resources on that machine. If not, replace the computer name with the IP address. If that doesn’t work either, then there are some other issues that need to be resolved.</p>

            <p>Already tried that. I’m also not even in a homegroup (I made sure to leave it).</p>
<p>I think I’ll just install W7 on the XP machine. That’ll probably save me a lot of time and effort.</p>
<p>I think the problem is that W7 doesn’t detect the XP computer, and thus can’t give it any permissions. I can ping it though. Strange shit.</p>

            <p>I’ve never been able to set up file sharing properly between 7 and XP due to the stupid HomeGroup (not to be mistaken with homegroup) bullshit that doesn’t let me access windows 7 folders on XP. I’ve always been able to view files that are on the XP machine properly, just enable file sharing and put videos in SharedDocs (or make more shared folders).</p>
