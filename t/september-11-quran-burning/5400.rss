<p>I personally have no problem with people practicing their beliefs unless it means they get to become violent towards me and my family as a result of me practicing MY beliefs.</p>

<p>So when some of “them” actually want to leave their “sandy countries”, so that they can practice their beliefs freely, in the USA for example, they should be sent back because you’re not allowed to practice your beliefs in their countries?</p>
<p>Or did you make that posts solely to point out that it isn’t possible for people to practice their beliefs everywhere?</p>

            <p>I can practice my culture anywhere I want to? So I can go to some of these sandy countries and practice my Christianity in the streets without fear of death eh?</p>
<p>It is great that you have such a liberal and wonderful “live and let live” mentality, but it doesn’t work that way everywhere.  But you knew that.</p>
<p>I’m just sayin.</p>

<p>Not taking any action is hardly an effort for destruction. I wonder if the only way for a decent life would be by attacking another country you would still say that it’s their right. And I didn’t understand the second sentence, but that just because I’m not so smart as you are :awesome:</p>

</aside>
<p>uh… apparently. that sentence was fairly easy to understand. you might just be entirely stupid, but then again most racists, bigots, and self-admitted xenophobes are. you happen to fall under all three categories!<br>
please tell me how they are attacking your country. they have every right to practice their culture ANYWHERE THEY WANT TO. if you don’t like it then don’t participate, you have absolutely no say in who is or isn’t “allowed” in a country THAT IS NOT EVEN YOURS.</p>

Your post just confirmed your lack of empathy and humanity.</p>
<p>And you “didn’t cause anything”? Your entire way of life (and mine, of course) is based on the exploitation of “third world countries”. If you don’t realize that, you should really take another look at the world, because you have <span class="bbcode-i">no idea</span>.</p>
