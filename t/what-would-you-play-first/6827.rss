    <title>What would you play first?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-would-you-play-first/6827</link>
    <description>Alright, I looked and I don&#39;t know if there is one of these already (Sorry for this if there is). But I was wondering, if Black Mesa, Half Life 2 Episode 3 and Half Life 3 all somehow got released at the exact same time, which would you play first?</description>

<p>if you think about it, if they both came out on the same day, I would be torn between which one to play first, I would probably attempt to run both at the same time.</p>

<p>Wait, you celebrate Christmas but not Easter? You can’t have one without the other. Those days are related to the same dude.</p>
<p>Oh and I would play Epsiode 3 first thing. I agree with whom ever said we already know what happens in the past. Time to move on with the story and THEN relive the whole thing from the beginning</p>

            <p>Playing Half Life 3 before Episode 3 seems a little redundant; I’d probably play Ep3 before Black Mesa if only for the fact I’ve played through the Half Life series quite recently and could use a fresh story.</p>

<p>Neither do I, but that’s not the point I was trying to make.  What I meant is, that since Black Mesa, Half-Life 2 Episode 3 and Half-Life 3 are - <span class="bbcode-i">without any doubt whatsoever</span> - never going to be released on the same day, this whole thread is pointless.  It would be the equivalent of discussing which holiday you’re gonna celebrate, if they were somehow all on the same day.</p>
<p>Don’t let my opinion stop you though, if you really think this thread is interesting.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I have a question.  What if somehow Easter, Christmas, and Thanksgiving would all be on the same day?  Would you first paint eggs, open your presents, or eat turkey?</p>

<p>Er, well I don’t do thanksgiving and I don’t celebrate Easter, so that’s a no-brainer!</p>

<p>Alright, I looked and I don’t know if there is one of these already (Sorry for this if there is). But I was wondering, if Black Mesa, Half Life 2 Episode 3 and Half Life 3 all somehow got released at the exact same time, which would you play first?</p>

            <p>Personally I would play Episode 3 first since I really want to know what happens next. We already know what happens in Black Mesa.</p>
