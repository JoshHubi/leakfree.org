    <title>What game(s) did you buy today?</title>

    <description>In the same spirit of the game played thread but for games you&#39;ve just bought.

----

Today I bought Persona 4 Golden for the PS Vita. It was a completely blind buy and I have not played it yet.

As someone who never played a single game in the entire franchise and does not play jRPGs at all, what&#39;s some good advice you can give me before I dive into the game?</description>

            <p>MGSV: Ground Zeroes.<br>
I was planning on getting it when The Phantom Pain came out, but then one of my roommates told me it was on sale for $5. (Which I didn’t have in my Steam Wallet)<br>
A quick exchange of cash got another roommate to buy it and gift it to me.</p>
<p>So excited.</p>

            <p>Space Station 13. I think I may discovered one of my new favorite bugs.</p>
<p>I managed to set up my character’s medical records with some fancy custom formatting. You can view them just fine at a console, but viewing them from any handheld PDA will instantly brick the thing. It’s amazing. That’s not even supposed to be possible.</p>
<p>Edit: Why do I keep thinking this is the other thread? Pah.</p>

            <p>Transistor! I’ve put it off more than long enough. I loved Bastion so much, I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to play Transistor. Anyway, it’s very good. A lot more challenging than Bastion. Which… isn’t saying much, because Bastion wasn’t exactly known for its difficultly. But I’m having a lot of fun with it.</p>

            <p>Metro 2033: Redux</p>
<p>I haven’t played much of the original so it’s hard to make comparisons (I only got to like chapter 2 in it?), but does anyone know full extent of graphical updates/changes between the games and has the time to explain it? I’ve looked up a bunch of stuff and lots of people seem to say it looks worse now, though I can’t tell if they’re saying it factually or out of bias/nostalgia.</p>
<p>For example reading this - <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2466623/metro-2033/metro-redux-review-the-definitive-way-to-play-metro-2033-and-metro-last-light.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2466623/metro-2033/metro-redux-review-the-definitive-way-to-play-metro-2033-and-metro-last-light.html</a><br>
Redux just seems better by far, but I can’t tell if the removed particles are cause he has an AMD card and Phys X turned off, or if they’re just gone (in which case thats a little sad, smoke and dust particles are so pretty).</p>
