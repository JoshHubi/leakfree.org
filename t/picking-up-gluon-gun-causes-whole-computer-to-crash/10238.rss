    <title>Picking up Gluon gun causes whole computer to crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/picking-up-gluon-gun-causes-whole-computer-to-crash/10238</link>
    <description>Bit of a weird one:

When encountering the Gluon gun, picking it up caused my whole computer to freeze. This could be repeated reliably 3-4 times in a row and happened literally just as the gun was picked up.

The odd thing is, I then picked it up by accident (trying to open the door so I could kill the bullsquid) and no crash. Just thought I&#39;d report it though.

Let me know if you need computer info.</description>

            <p>Post your system specs (CPU, GPU, OS)<br>
I had a similar problem on my crappy laptop, but it depends. Does it show any error when it crashes?</p>
