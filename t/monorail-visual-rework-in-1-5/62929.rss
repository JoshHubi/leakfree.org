    <title>Monorail visual rework in 1.5?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/monorail-visual-rework-in-1-5/62929</link>
    <description>Is the monorail tram going to receive any additional visual reworks in 1.5? I always though that while the model shows a lot of work it never made a lot of sense and its textures feel too handcrafted and complex (too grainy).

Takig a look to that photo reference the textures could be a lot simplier and make better use of phong materials (flooring doesn&#39;t have any crevices and the same goes to walls), seats are simplier an usually aren&#39;t individually separated (less polygons).</description>
