            <p>I tried watching 2010 and just couldn’t. I liked the ending to 2001 and 2010 just ruined all the stuff about the first movie for me. And the filming style was totally different due to a different director and it looked lower budget to me somehow. Just everything about the movie turned me off.</p>

<p>2001 is a movie about space with a subplot about a monolith.Space is not a mystery to me like it was to the world when the movie was made. I don’t like it for this reason. I can’t understand and respect the movie for what it is, but watching it is a chore.</p>
<p>I actually like 2010 better. It’s a movie about a monolith that is set in space, and the ending actually makes sense (probably because the script was written and finished before they started filming  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  ).</p>

            <p>Yeah, a lot of old movies and shows have been permanently lost because the tapes are missing, destroyed, or just worn out with age. I think some of the earliest episodes of doctor who are gone for this reason, among many others.</p>

Except for the mediary bullshit. That was so fucking hamfisted and corny even for the time. In fact, I think that’s what most of the reviewers hated about it too  :s</p>

<p>It’s still got a little bit missing but most of the footage was restored. They had a premier in Germany this year or last that I found a recording of and it was pretty cool. You might be able to find it on piratebay still. You should watch it if you can, it’s really good.<br>

<p>If you like screwball comedies (unfortunately, I do; it’s a weakness of mine), might I suggest the 1970s flick “What’s Up Doc?”</p>
<p>Yeah, I know it has Barbra Streisand in this but she’s actually okay in this.  It’s also Madeline Khan’s first feature-length movie and it has, as the judge–in a great casting choice–Liam Dunn (the preacher from “Blazing Saddles”).  In fact, the movie has a very Mel Brooksian feel to it even though it wasn’t made by him.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend it.</p>

            <p>If you like screwball comedies (unfortunately, I do; it’s a weakness of mine), might I suggest the 1970s flick “What’s Up Doc?”</p>
<p>Yeah, I know it has Barbra Streisand in this but she’s actually okay in this.  It’s also Madeline Khan’s first feature-length movie and it has, as the judge–in a great casting choice–Liam Dunn (the preacher from “Blazing Saddles”).  In fact, the movie has a very Mel Brooksian feel to it even though it wasn’t made by him.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend it.</p>

            <p>Isn’t Metropolis that really old sci-fi movie with some of the footage missing?</p>
