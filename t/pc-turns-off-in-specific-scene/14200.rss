    <title>PC turns off in specific scene</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pc-turns-off-in-specific-scene/14200</link>
    <description>The scene in questionable ethics after you leave the scientists to go outside on your own is where my PC is crashing every single time I try to play it. After around 30 seconds of loading up the scene, my computer just turns itself off.
I&#39;d get some screenshots, but I don&#39;t want to turn my computer off again.
This has happened over 3 times now consistently.

There&#39;s nothing for black mesa in my Steam/dumps/ folder.</description>

            <p>Like Morloc said, check the Windows Event Log (can be found by searching in the Start menu) and see if any fatal errors happened at the times of the crashes.<br>
Windows event logs are created and saved instantaneously, so there will most likely be something there.<br>
Also, try updating any out-of-date video drivers and such, it never hurts to check that sort of thing.</p>

<p>the answer is simple, instead of starting BM with your PC on, start BM with PC off then it will surely turn itself on at that exact same part and you will be able to play the rest of the game</p>

<p>I doubt very much its blackmesa. I would say either memory or graphics card ie drivers.</p>
<p>Ofcourse it could be that its trying to play a sound and the audio drivers are falling over. Have a look through the windows event log and see if anything stands out</p>

<p>Tried replaying to the part I was at, but it crashed my pc on the launch aswell. It’s not been happening with any other games, and it was working before in that part.</p>
<p>That being said, I’ll see if I can get any logs that are made before my pc crashes.</p>

            <p>I cleaned my PC out just recently and bought a new GPU just recently because of the old one overheating (due to issue with fan). Also, it wouldn’t just turn itself off, nor within 30s after being off for 8 hours.</p>

            <p>Sounds like possibly an overheating issue.  Maybe check to see if your computer is dusty inside and take a can of compressed air to it?</p>
