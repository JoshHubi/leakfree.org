    <description>Half-Life 3 is in development, says Counter-Strike co-creator.   :slight_smile: 

Found this article on Neowin today:

Minh &#39;Gooseman&#39; Le is the co-creator of the phenomenally popular Half-Life mod Counter-Strike, and a former employee of Valve. In a recent interview by goRGNtv on Twitch, Le claimed that he has seen evidence that Valve is indeed working on a new sequel. 

When asked about Half-Life 3, Le joked that there was &quot;a laser sight at [his] head right now&quot;, adding: &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can talk about that to be honest... but I think it&#39;s kind of public knowledge, that people know that it is being worked on, and so if I were to say that, yeah, I&#39;ve seen some images, like some concept art of it, that wouldn&#39;t be big news to be honest.&quot;

            <p>Albums a lot of the time don’t have the artist or title on them. I don’t know why people are saying it won’t work on a video game case. Especially for a big game that most people will recognize by the logo.</p>

            <p>Not sure if it counts, but I’ve got an album and both the album title and artist name are only located on the spine.</p>
<p>But it’s not difficult to create and print CD covers. Especially ones that simplistic. Case looks in rough condition, too.</p>

            <p>LOL. I contend that Half-Life 3 needs no title.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Drama factor aside, it’d be pretty bad marketing to actually go without putting the title on the box at all.</p>

            <p>That doesn’t prove much of anything unless we know where he got that. Also the fact that there’s a rating on the box is kind of suspicious. I’m not sure if you’re saying the Instagram person is a troll or Valve though.</p>

<p>I really hope HL3 isn’t vr exclusive. I want to be able to play it like the other HL games and without buying a bunch of extra equipment to play it. As cool as vr seems, stuff like the Kinect also seemed pretty cool, but all it was useful for was gimmicky games. This vr stuff should be used to enhance games, not required to play most games. Of course I don’t have a problem with making games to show it off, but make new games for that. Don’t make the third (fifth) game in a series require it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think Valve has an interest in having exclusive content, meaning they will likely also release a version for “normal” PC gaming or vice versa, a extra version of the game for VR. They always wanted to make their games, tech and software accessible for everyone. That’s why Steam OS is based on Linux for example, they are working on a new open graphic API, don’t use/sell their Steam Machines or the tech for the VR exclusively and so on.</p>
<p>What I meant was that people shouldn’t expect HL3 soon, even with Source 2 and VR around the corner, things that most people speculated would be THE reason for the delay or rather requirement for a new HL3 part. Why requirement ? Well, to start with something fresh and revolutionary - and VR without doubt is exactly that - HL would’ve been the perfect fit. Think about it: Every Half-Life set new standards and marks in it’s time (well the episodes not so much), whether it be for the graphics, immersion or physics.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But “Not saying no” doesn’t equal “Yes, we’re doing it absolutely”. Still, even if VR would be no thing for HL3 at all, I assume a new installment in the Half Life Series is still ways of, IF they even want to further pursue Half Life all together for the time being. Because right now, it seems that with Steam VR, the machines and everything else in the works, Valve will focus solely on these things in the next years and either start on a new IP or rely on an existing one for launch of  Source 2 and VR. And that probably won’t be HL3 (at least that’s my gut feeling), because of the reasons discussed in the article.</p>
<p>In short: What I’m saying is: Don’t sweat it, this news probably means nothing. If it does and Valve surprises us this or next year with a Hl3 announcement for… IDK, 2018 or something, good for us, I think (!?).</p>

            <p>It was always a presentation on physics. If anything Source 2 related is going to be shown it’ll probably be at the glNext thing. I can’t remember what I said when I posted the info here but it was never a conference that Valve was doing to announce games.</p>

<p>It’ll probably end up being nothing just like every other time stuff like this has happened. Valve’s booth at GDC is on 3/3/15 at 3:00PM though. I think the convention schedules stuff, but that’s still a hilarious coincidence/humor on the convention’s part.</p>
<p>Edit: At least one of them is at that time. The physics one. The OpenGL one isn’t though.</p>

            <p>The main thing I’m looking forward to in Half-Life 3 is…</p>
<p>Enemy variation.</p>
<p>In Half-Life 2 the player was supposed to have encountered some Bullsquids, Houndeyes, and a few other Xenian aliens.</p>
<p>Along with the Gargantua at some point.</p>
<p>But somewhere along the line… that all got shoved into a room and got locked.</p>
<p>Because in Half-Life 2 it’s just Combine, Headcrabs, and that’s it… it’s kinda just the same enemies.</p>
<p>I hope there’s enemy variation in Half-Life 3.</p>
