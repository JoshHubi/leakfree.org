            <p>This is actually pretty good, makes me think of something ‘Digitalism’ would make. Plus you say your 17? You’ve got a long way to go, but I have to say I’m excited to follow, wherever your taking this. Keep it up.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if you create music to apply to an element (video game, movie etc…) or if you create for listening enjoyment, but I hear some good melodies in there for sure.</p>
<p>You have a nice build up to the climax. There are one or two overbearing instruments (Or VST’s) but you did well in cutting them short so I can have a break from it from them until your next build up.</p>
<p>My personal tastes don’t have me listening to this while I’m driving down the road but I can definitely find enjoyment listening to your song while playing a nice side scrolling game similar to Super Meat Boy.</p>
<p>Keep up the good tunes</p>

<p>You can’t go wrong with honesty. I totally agree with you. I favor epic background music you might find in a movie or videogame, with an orchestra/ ambient feel. Like John Williams! He’s my idol and has inspired me greatly as a kid -from Star Wars to Jurassic Park (I’m 17 btw so I guess I’m still considered a kid). I try basing my music more off this orchestra form that enriches an experience, and gives you that chilly feeling. Its hard to explain, but I’m sure you know what I mean  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
