    <description>**Xen**

Bad collision on loads of models. Makes no sense that a couple of tree branches blocks everything including bullets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB9VbBvZqRo
Misleading collision on this floor. The whole area below can be destroyed by grenades anyway like video below:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t1XAQBXz_E

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoRofdidX5I
There&#39;s a really big invisible wall that stretches far beyond the vines.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIgQMsb37RQ
No collision in this prop.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbNp6f1VkrA
Props have a really big collision box.

*WATER*

Water is extremely bad in some parts of the chapters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m17HXB2MQRA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-tg5kkpseU
Seen in these videos is the itchy bugging out AND the fact that actual water is far below the &quot;water&quot; texture. Being underwater has no effects which means it&#39;s like you&#39;re just floating. It&#39;s very empty the entire thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUvyIByo2oY
More of the same. Same map too IIRC.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLGfQhSvWqA
Buggy waterfall effects from certain angles.

*AI*
AI can glitch out in some areas or can&#39;t reach you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEtQQyy0T5I
Gonarch gets stuck and gets stuck in a static animation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_TgmBNhJgI
Enemies can&#39;t get to you here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLHKusHICbw
Enemies have a hard time pathing down this crystal thing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jq0Lnomsfk
Gonarch arrives too early and is even very inactive when finally going down. Additional thing in this video is visual stuff with the purple goo. It is seen through from behind.

*Trigger stuff*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6foxNp2Il9k
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFxgA38QWns
Destroying these specific bombs triggers a trigger_hurt that instantly kills you even though there is no visual indicator for it. In the 2nd video you can even trigger it after going past the area and then going back.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlvG5K3Mrwg
Gonarch can knock you up too high and have it trigger the smash sequence at the crevice too early, blocking your way to progress and instantly killing you when you try.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQCPnlE1w0
It isn&#39;t a good idea to use trigger brushes on these leaves. It just doesn&#39;t work well visually. Why not make the leaves an entity that triggers when landed on?

*Out of bounds/skips*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZg1Aosemqo
No invisible wall for this hole, allowing you to escape the entire map.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE8_73I8THw
Gonarch can knock you to the other side of the arena, making you progress faster and without the gonarch.


**Maps need serious culling at bottom of all maps**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiAb04kLo-E
Hearing the stupid ragdoll sounds so fast when you kill an enemy off the ledge and just seeing them land on the skybox really takes off the atmosphere and kills the whole feeling of being on a floating island.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk9jcH7W4XY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUlZ5ms1qAQ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAlH9thWBeA

*Misc stuff*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAxDW2tiEIE
Wire twitches a lot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwPUfp6WeG4
The area is flickering a lot, it looks like there are maybe 2 models ontop of eachother?</description>
