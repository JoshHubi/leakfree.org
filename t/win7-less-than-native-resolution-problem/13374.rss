    <title>Win7 Less-than-native resolution problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/win7-less-than-native-resolution-problem/13374</link>
    <description>I upgraded to Win7 recently, as my win xp died...
I am getting a problem with my games which I run in less than native resolution (or different screen format, I think) - they get black borders on screen... Can anyone tell me about a possible solution?
P.S. Nvidia Control Panel seems not to be working too, I&#39;m currently going to install new driver with &quot;clean install&quot;, hope it helps...</description>

            <p>Thanks for the help, but I got it working the way I wanted after I installed new Nvidia driver. After that, the control panel woked normally and I managed to set it so it would always fill the screen. The problem was aspect ratio - mine is 16:9 (or 16:10, I don’t really remember), so running 4: 3 caused black borders to appear before the change.</p>

            <p>There are two things you can do if you’re running less than native resolution: stretch the picture to fit your screen or put letterboxing around the picture. It seems like it’s doing the second for you when you want it to do the first. There’s a way to set it up in the Nvidia control panel so let me know when you have that working.</p>
<p>Also, do you want no black bars at all (in which case if you’re running at an aspect ratio different from your monitor the picture will be distorted) or are you fine with say black bars on the sides with a [noparse]4:3[/noparse] resolution? If you’re keeping the same aspect ratio but just a lower resolution this shouldn’t matter as stretching the picture to your screen shouldn’t cause any distortion.</p>
