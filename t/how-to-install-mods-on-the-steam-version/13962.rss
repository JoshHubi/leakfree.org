    <title>How to install mods on the Steam version?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-install-mods-on-the-steam-version/13962</link>
    <description>Hello I recently installed black mesa and have noticed that it now uses the vpk system which is great but how do you install skins or mods that came out before the mod was a game? I went into the mod directory and tried creating a custom folder just like for Counter strike source or Tf2 but it doesn&#39;t seem to work. Is there something I&#39;m missing? Any help would be much appreciated.</description>

<p>Can somebody explain the changes in gameinfo.txt extactly?<br>

<p>It’s  <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> unnecessary to modify the gameinfo.txt, just place mods into the addons folder (but not the addons/workshop folder).</p>

            <p>Never mind I figured it out I was putting files into the steam workshop folder inside the addons folder, instead of putting them into just the addons folder which is why they were being deleted thanks for the help guys!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/thumbsup.png?v=9" title=":thumbsup:" class="emoji" alt=":thumbsup:"> Everything seems to be in order now.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not sure if vpk files are allowed as attachments but could you either put your vpk on mediafire or something and link it, or put the vpk in a zip or rar and attach that(surely those can be attached?)<br>
I’ll see if i can figure out what the issue is</p>

            <p>I edited the .dmx scripts for a few of the guns that don’t have cvars for damage, etc and made a vpk and put it in bms/addons. Its still there after running the game so i’ve got no idea why it would delete your vpk addon.</p>
<p>I should probably verify that the gun values actually changed lol, gonna go do that.</p>
<p>edit: confirmed working for weapon script modding. I upped the 357 to 50 dmg from 45, set vortigaunts to have 50hp(for the test), spawned one ingame and one torso shot took him down.</p>
<p>Also, in my post about folder structure I wasn’t paying attention and forgot to add that you need to have a folder that is your “mod” or whatever. I used “Weapon Rebalance/gameplay/weapons/weapon_357.dmx” or weapon_shotgun, etc .</p>

            <p>I found out how to make the folders into vpk’s and they seem to work okay but whenever I try to start the game up it deletes them. Good thing I had a backup of them or I would have lost all the mods I made into vpks! Does anybody know how I can get them to work?</p>

            <p>Adding to what Lestat said, make sure you have the folder structure correct before making it into a VPK. For instance, a new firing sound for the Magnum would need to be “sound/weapons/357/single.wav” or “materials/models/weapons/v_357/357_sheet.vtf” for a reskin of the Magnum.</p>
<p>I just noticed that the folders for the 357, crowbar, shotgun, satchel charge, and viewmodel hands are under “materials/models/weapons” in the textures vpk while the rest of the weapons(glock, gluon, etc) are in “materials/models” for some reason. Odd</p>

            <p>Hello I recently installed black mesa and have noticed that it now uses the vpk system which is great but how do you install skins or mods that came out before the mod was a game? I went into the mod directory and tried creating a custom folder just like for Counter strike source or Tf2 but it doesn’t seem to work. Is there something I’m missing? Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
