    <title>Black Mesa Coop with Synergy?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-coop-with-synergy/11221</link>
    <description>I was able to get BMS into Synergy but i have a problem. There are no ais and a lot of errors in the console pointing to missing actors.
The method i used was by copying bms files right into  synergy folder.
Another way is by creating an &quot;Game Definition File&quot; so that the mod will appear under Game Mounts in menu but i have no idea how.
Anyone tried to make it compatible?

            <p>Think its all about compatibility but since Synergy supports mods too not only hl2, dont think is that hard to make the ais work. Maybe the devs from Synergy will work on it soon.</p>

            <p>There’s lots of missing code, probably. I don’t know how it could be fixed, personally. There’s a <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=13451" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">really hackish setup</a> but I haven’t tried it so I couldn’t speak to it’s efficacy.</p>
