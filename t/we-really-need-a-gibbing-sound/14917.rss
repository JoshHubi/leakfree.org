    <title>We really need a gibbing sound</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/we-really-need-a-gibbing-sound/14917</link>
    <description>Especially since the alt fire for the shotgun now gibs things, it&#39;s a lot more noticeable when a scientist still screams as per his normal death scream, after he&#39;s already been blown to bits and has no head.

Also is single player gibbing glitched? In MP when you blow someone up the gibs seem to have the momentum of the explosion/attack, while in SP currently NPC gibs just kind of fall to the ground</description>
