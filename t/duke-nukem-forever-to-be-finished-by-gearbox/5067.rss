    <description>According to an article on Kotaku, Gearbox software is  going to finish this sequel. With a source even indicating that a demo might even come out this year. What does everyone think, could  Dnf&#39;s  development time finally be up?

            <p>yes. it doesn’t have to be like Team Fortress 2 to look like a cartoon.<br>
Have you guys ever read comic books? they have vastly different art styles. Donald Duck doesn’t look like anything Marvel comics but they are both comic books.</p>
<p>seems like a misunderstanding here…</p>

            <p>My two cents on the cartoony debate: DNF may not be gritty, but I wouldn’t call it Cartoony. I’d say it’s texture style would be similar to that of Halo 3’s.</p>

            <p>For the record, cartoony != cell shaded (or whatever the equivalent ink n paint material was called before accelerated shaders existed). I believe that’s where the confusions may come from.</p>

<p>Sorry, didnt mean to sound so angry lol, but I do interpret being in denial as an insult (represents a lack of common sense and reality, which I hold as sacred).  Ill take it you didn’t mean it as such…no hard feelings.</p>

            <p>i wouldnt have said duke 3d was cartoony. with the exception of the epic nipples: <span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>like doom it was low quality images which i spose gave the appearance of a cartoony graphics but compared to games like full throttle and day of the tentacle which were intentionally cartoony and released around the same date you can see the difference.</p>
<p>I do agree with the childish jokes but thats part of the fun. we all say those lines when we pwn newbs online now. childish jokes - yes, but now common language amongst internet-folk</p>

            <p>Now your being insulting.  Nostalgic denial?  Sorry, but go fuck yourself, im not in denial.</p>
<p>Your explanation and description of cartoony is shitty and half assed:<br>
Please, explain to me how its modeled and drawn like a cartoon?<br>
What does “exaggerated characters” mean?<br>
How is Duke’s voice “childish?”<br>
How does it “play out like a cartoon?”<br>
Once again, you are incapable of explaining yourself and your opinion.  In my eyes, Duke is dark and girtty, while being humorous but not cartoony.  I suppose as soon as humor is injected, its automatically cartoony to you.  I believe the term you are looking for to describe Duke3D is COMICAL…not cartoony, two completely different things.</p>
<p>Duke Nukem’s character is comical, Duke Nukem 3D is NOT cartoony.</p>
<p>Besides, the point of this discussion is the GRAPHICS and the look I would prefer for the newest Duke game, its that simple. I think your the one who doesn’t know what hes talking about.  Its not really even that big of a deal honestly, Im sure I will enjoy the newest iteration of Duke regardless.</p>

            <p>Doom didn’t look cartoony to me. Duke did. why? Because it does. I still don’t get how you can not acknowledge that. It looks like a cartoon because it is drawn and modeled like a cartoon. It has bright colors, exaggerated characters, childish voiceovers (come get some, who wants some, oh yeah, groovy baby), with childish jokes, and plays out like a cartoon.</p>
<p>That isn’t a bad thing, but it is true. You are so in a nostalgic denial it is scary.</p>

            <p>If that is true, that is good to know and definitely makes a difference.  I was curious to know if gearbox was going to finish DNF or start from scratch.  Regardless, even if gearbox does not finish DNF as started by 3DRealms, no matter what Duke Nukem game is released it will be the proverbial “Duke Nukem Forever” that everyone has been waiting for, aka, a FPS “sequal” to Duke3D, whatever the new title happens to be.  Gearbox should start from scratch though and not simply finish something from 3DRealms.</p>

<p>Yes, things do exist on a scale, and Duke 3d looks cartoony to me. I can’t believe that you don’t see it. The new game looks more dark and gritty then the original to me.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not to be annoying, but I would love some reasoning behind your opinion (people love to state opinions without their reasoning, thats probably why I “don’t see it”)…what makes the original duke graphics cartoony? Explain.  You have to keep in mind the technology available back in 96, I personally think it is due to the relatively shit graphics that make it appear cartoony to you.</p>
<p>Now that I think about, you dont have to answer.  We can just let this topic die, its like beating a dead horse.  I am excited for Duke no matter what, I just hope Im not <span class="bbcode-i">too</span> disappointed.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Somebody already said this but Gearbox WILL NOT be working on DNF. in order to stay afloat and continue working on DNF 3Drealms sold the rights to making a second Duke Nukem videogame to Gearbox. Gearbox will be making their entirely own Duke Nukem game while 3Drealms will continue to not finish DNF.</p>
<p>I couldn’t find the article I read it from, or I’d link it.</p>

            <p>Wat? I didn’t know about that. Meh, it’s kinda bad I suppose, but it doesn’t have the noticeable impact on gameplay that no AA does. Playing Halo pc, I’m just sitting there thinking OH GOD MY EYES ARE BLEEDING.</p>

            <p>I think they should start by picking an engine and staying with it. After all, that’s the main reason DNF isn’t out today; they kept changing engines and having to scrap 90% of the content each time. Also Duke is gritty in a silly colourful way. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, so it’s a fun, humorous experience. (Even if most of that humor is childish)</p>

            <p>so long as there are ten dollar hookers, pipe bombs and door-kicking shenanagans I’ll be happy. The ulimate irony is that the perfectionistic bullshit that has delayed this game for a decade is wasted on fans that would have settled for moar fun and less graphix about 8 years ago.</p>
<p>sigh.</p>

            <p>You are the first person Ive known to describe Duke Nukem 3D as bright, colorful, and cartoony.  It was colorful, because it wasn’t black and white, so I will give you that.</p>
<p>Things exist within a scale, things arent simply THIS or THAT; it may not be AS dark and gritty as quake, but I sure as hell wouldnt describe D3D as bright and cartoony.  Most of the game took place at night and fighting aliens/pig cops (which is probably the most comical and childish gameplay aspect of Duke3D) does not justify a cartoony description.</p>
<p>Just for an idea of the style I prefer, here are some early DNF screenshots:</p>

<p>The current iteration of DNF, as seen in the teaser, is not as dark and gritty. Different strokes for different folks…lets just leave it at that and move on.</p>

That all looks quite exaggerated to me. Especially when you compare to Doom which came out 3 years prior on a far less capable engine.<br>

            <p>Duke3D was as realistic as you could get, for an fps, in 96. Thanks for agreeing it was not cartoony, but please describe how its graphics were exaggerated, while keeping in mind the limitations of the tech in 96.</p>
<p>Also, I do not think brown = realistic, nor want COD graphics.  Speaking of colors, who else is a little disappointed with the amount of brown seen in the latest <a href="https://pc.ign.com/dor/objects/907179/deus-ex-3-unofficial-title/videos/gamescom10_deusex_trl_gameplaytrailer_81210.html?show=hi" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">video of Deus Ex 3</a>?</p>

<p>I know Duke3d, apparently better than you do.  Go play it and tell me how Im wrong.  That game is gritty and mature (it has an adult content lockout btw)  and not supposed to be cartoony, 3DRealms was striving for realism (as much as '96 tech would allow, thats the only reason why Duke3D <span class="bbcode-i">MAY APPEAR</span> cartoony). You do not know what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, how old are you and when did you first play D3D?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m 22 and I first played D3D when it came out. The game is created in an exaggerated and colorful style. It’s not cartoony, but they were obviously by no means striving for realism.  The leaked footage of DNF fits the style well IMO.  If you want brown ‘realistic’ graphics go play COD.</p>
