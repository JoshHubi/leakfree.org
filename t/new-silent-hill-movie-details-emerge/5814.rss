[i]&quot;For years, Heather Mason and her father have been on the run, always one step ahead of dangerous forces that she doesn&#39;t fully understand,&quot; the synopsis reads. &quot;Now on the eve of her 18th birthday, plagued by terrifying nightmares and the disappearance of her father, Heather discovers she&#39;s not who she thinks she is. The revelation leads her deeper into a demonic world that threatens to trap her in Silent Hill forever.&quot;[/i]

Hope you liked Silent Hill 3 cause they&#39;re making a movie out of it.
Personally I can&#39;t wait. The Silent Hill movie was one of the few gametomovie adaptations that went well.

<p>Man, i also loved sh2 best, but its funny how everybody call it the best horror game nowdays, i remember first reviews, and it was doing really bad, most i saw were 5-6/10</p>

</aside>
<p>yeah, because it was doing a new thing<br>
it wasn’t fun<br>
it was trying to convey different emotions, like dread and exhaustion</p>
<p>well okay not that new since sh1 was already out</p>
<p>also if there is any mention of pyramid head on the previews the movie will god damn suck</p>

</aside>
<p>Regardless of how accurately they follow the game’s storyline (and they can’t absolutely because of what they’ve already done) I can’t see there being a place for Sean Bean’s character.</p>

I hope the second movie is just as fucked up.</p>

            <p>I agree that SH2 is the best game, though I prefer the story they went with in the movie to the one in the games. I’m looking forward to this.</p>
<p>I hope they use as little CG in this as they did in the first film. Those monsters were hella scary and the people in those suits were real talented.</p>

            <p>Silent Hill 2 was the best fucking game, why spoil the fun and skip to the third. Seriously, this is going to end up like the Resident Evil franchise - which sucks massive cock.</p>
