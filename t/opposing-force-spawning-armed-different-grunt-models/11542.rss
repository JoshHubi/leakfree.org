    <title>Opposing Force: Spawning armed &amp; different grunt models</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/opposing-force-spawning-armed-different-grunt-models/11542</link>
    <description>I realise that asking this on a source modification of Half Life may not be the brightest idea, but seeing as console commands are pretty much universal with HL, I thought it was worth a shot.

Anyways. I&#39;ve browsed the interwebs far and wide, and have been unable to find and answer to this particular question.

While I am aware of the -dev -console command parameters for hl.exe, and the accompanying sv_cheats 1, restart/load another map, then give monster_human_grunt_ally to spawn generic gas mask grunts, or give monster_human_medic_ally / monster_human_torch_ally to spawn medics and engineers respectively.

The problem is all they all come unarmed. I have heard of the impulse 76 cheat, but all that does is require a restart, and then restarts the level. Nothing seems to happen.

What I am after is firstly, the commands to spawn the large variety of grunts and models available, ie the tower, beret sergeant, headwrap and balaklava models, both ethnic white and black, and also the mustached beret model (seen in We&#39;re pulling out), with assorted weapons such as the M4, M249, shotgun and so forth, as seen here:

So basically, how do I spawn them, and how do I arm them.

Thanks.

PS: I am using the steam version of Op4, with the HD pack installed.</description>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Dias, but I mean ingame, I’m playing the Foxtrot Uniform level and would love to have more soldiers to command!</p>

            <p>If you’re going to make a map with hammer, you should easily be able to spawn the entities with different skins &amp; weapons. Console commands aren’t necessary for this.</p>
