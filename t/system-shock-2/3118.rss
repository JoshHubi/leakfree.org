    <title>System Shock 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/system-shock-2/3118</link>
    <description>I recently pulled this game out of my &quot;old games&quot; draw, and I have to say, its probrably the most fun i&#39;ve had for a while in any game recently. While the graphics suck, the gameplay is very good, and the atmosphere is incredible - it still retains its scare factor today, even with it&#39;s low end technology and graphical capabilities.

Its a bit of a bitch to get running on newer operating systems, but it is well worth it. It is one of the most atmospheric experiences you can have with a game - the combination of excellent sound design and constant survival aspect make this game incredibly eerie to play.

Bioshock has been recognised as sytem shock 2&#39;s successor, except System Shock 2 has far deeper gameplay in many areas (hacking, character development, and psi skills/plasmids). The enemies in system shock 2 and Bioshock are very similar, except those in System Shock tend to be alot more fear inspiring and seem more real IMO. As for the setting, rapture is very classy, but the Von Braun is AWESOME - the helpless survivor aspect added to the immersion tenfold. If you like Bioshock, you will LOVE System Shock 2.

Luckily for us, some kind people have created mods that increase the level of details on enemies, weapons models, player models, and textures, allowing it to actually look semi-decent.</description>

<p>I agree. A lot of gaming companies (Valve and DICE excluded) tend to do this with their sequels.</p>

            <p>wow, I’ve never had any of the trouble that everyone else seems to have playing System Shock 2, I’ve played it on all 4 operating systems since it’s release, and it was relatively smooth sailing to get it working, mods and all, each time</p>
<p>biggest thing Dead Space did wrong was the sound, that B-movie/Psycho style horror audio every time there are enemies nearby cheapens the game/atmosphere, and all the whispering and whatnot throughout cheapens it even more.  simple, area based, elevator/mall music is the quintessential tone-setter.</p>
<p>hearing that garden music and the midwife saying “little ones need lots of care” still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up lol</p>
<p>but nice try by ea with Dead Space, they have the rights to SS2 right?  seems they took a lot from it anyways, without necessarily even trying, it’s a better (spiritual) successor to SS2 than BioShock IMO</p>

<p>Thanks, worked like a charm! Well… except for:</p>
<p>“SHOCK2 caused an Access Violation in module SHOCK2.EXE at 001b:00594937.<br>
Error occurred at 6/11/2010 23: 30:42.<br>

1 processor(s), type 586.<br>
2048 MBytes physical memory.<br>
Read from location 00000000 caused an access violation.”</p>
<p>P.S. tried renaming the LGVID.AX file again too.Also added SHOCK2.EXE to my antivirus’es safe file list.<br>
I’ll try a different version of the game.</p>
<p>[EDIT] Reinstalled it in the default dir (\games\Sshock2) and it seems to work. haven’t installed the MM yet though…</p>

            <p>woot!  finally played bioshock, it definitely lacked the progression of SS2.  your character and enemies are about the same from beginning to end, I kept waiting for something more grotesque and dangerous than a splicer, but it never came, kept waiting for a game-changing atom or eve upgrade, never came either, and the fact that the eve upgrades didn’t build on each other, but just had more powerful replacements… <em>sigh</em> and I strongly disliked the unlimited inventory, at one point I had to have been carrying around more than you could fit in a full size truck!!!</p>
<p>more variety in enemies; SS2 style inventory, powering up, and weapon management, and this game could have been perfect.  loved taking down those Rosies and Bouncers, and really loved the Atlas Shrugged influences</p>
<p>lol, comparing SS2 and Boishock on a half life remake board</p>
<p>also Dead Space ain’t bad, it has a lot of similarities to SS2</p>

<p>Soo, basically what we said about BS1 was true and it cut out a lot of things that made SS2 so good; then we started bitching and they realised what they did wrong and are taking steps to fix it in BS2?</p>

<p>Yes, I’ve played both. And you’re wrong to think that BS isn’t a dumbed down version of SS2. Of course it’s not a replica, but it is very derivative. Have you heard of the word “accessibility”? That doesn’t necessarily make it a bad game, but I can see why alot of SS2 fans inherently dislike it. Sure, you can customise your character with different plasmids and tonics, but then again you can go and freely swap then at any time at a gene bank. Kind of negates the purpose of choice, don’t you think? SS2 is more of a role playing game because it has an emphasis on choice and consequence. It lets you tailor your playing experience far better than the hand holding that is BS. It lets you build your skills in certain areas, such as strength, cybernetic affinity, agility and so on. The choices you make you’re stuck with. In short, BS is good if you want some run-and-gun mindless FPS action with pseudo role playing elements, SS2 is good if you want a deep, thoughtful and intellectual experience.</p>

<p>I think it’s far from a mindless FPS game, if you want a mindless game see MW2 or something. I mean, Bioshock doesn’t have much choices in the game but when you do choose to do something. (Let someone live, Harvest or save, etc) it affects the story. Honestly I never thought of SS as a uh… deep, thoughtful and intellectual experience, I thought of it as a game that was enjoyable.</p>
<p>It’s not like I’m disagreeing with you that SS has more role play elements than BS but BS was aimed at being a FPS with role play elements. It’s not like you have to have a leveling system and stats to make it a role playing game. I don’t think there is really a set requirement for genres like this.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. One of the focuses of going from BS1 to BS2 was to force the players to make more planned choices. In BS1 you could purchase all plasmids/tonics and fully upgrade them and fully upgrade your weapons as well. In BS2 they eliminated the power overwhelming concept and made it so you could upgrade most of your weapons, but not all. Same with plasmids. On another level, BS2 players have to manage their adam at a whole new level compared to BS1. It’s by no means on the level of SS2, but BS2 was a step in the right direction to getting there, IMO.</p>

<p>Have you even played SS2? Everything in Bioshock is a disturbingly dumbed down form of what appears in it. They’ve taken out pretty much all of the character development that makes SS2 interesting and replayable, and instead swapped it for some upgradeable powers and weapons that you distribute points into. With the character system in SS2, you could tailor it to fit your playstyle, eg A Hacker/Tech character, or a pure Psi character, whereas in BS you have access to all the classes at the same time. I think if they had kept the same level of depth and complexity of SS2 and tried to market it to a present day mainstream audience many people would be turned off or confused by it.</p>

<p>Yes I have, but have you played Bioshock?</p>
<p>You can tailor the character to fit your play style in Bioshock too, with tonics and plasmids and weapon upgrades. The game wasn’t setup to be for classes, it wasn’t supposed to be a replica of the SS series.</p>
<p>I just don’t think leveling up would feel right in Bioshock. I mean what do you think actually fits as a role-playing game? I wouldn’t call Bioshock a RP game but it has the same feeling as a RP one with more of a focus on FPS elements.</p>
