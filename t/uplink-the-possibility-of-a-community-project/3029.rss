    <title>UPLINK - the possibility of a community project</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/uplink-the-possibility-of-a-community-project/3029</link>
    <description>Maybe it&#39;s not in right time, but how about integrate the &quot;Uplink&quot; abandoned chapter back in game? After &quot;standard-and-already-boring&quot; HL gameplay, it give the shocking fight experience, fulfilled with blood, darkness and gore. Today I completed playing in it... beautiful, fresh, crystal-pure game!

Also today I&#39;m finished  HL: Day One (Demo), and spotted some interesting ideas were not seen in final game...</description>

            <p>OBM’s bullsquid looks like a messed up pitdrone trying to swallow a giant squid or something - imho, the tentacles don’t really look like they’re part of the creature and overall, it seems to deviate too far from the original.</p>

<p>I guess I should’ve said “possible” rather than realistic, since obviously, aliens cant’ be considered realistic. However, I can actually imagine that mod’s Bullsquid hopping around in real life, while I fail to see how the Bullsquid in HL and BMS could even stand up for more than 5 minute.</p>
<p>This is, of course going by the rules of evolution, where the best design prevails in the end. The original Bullsquid’s feet are way too tiny to allow the head and tail to be in balance of eachother, it might be possible and the Bullsquid’s legs might be strong enough to balance it out, but that would require too much effort for it to move around not only as a hunter, but as a prey as well.</p>
<p>The mod’s Bullsquid has bigger feet, longer tail and a head+body that feels a lot less heavy. I can imagine a beast like that existing, while the original… Well, the original looks like it came out of a bad sci-fi movie (probably the only (well, + the houndeyes) creatures in HL that really mde no sense to me).</p>

</aside>
<p>it’s pretty much a bipedal version of crocidilia. did you notice how it loves to swim in swamp and dirty locations. Being as your taking video game anatomy to the extreme, you might as well say that the bullsquid is amphibious.</p>

            <p>So far, Operation Black mesa can’t use BM content, because if I’m correct, BM team is not going to release source code.</p>
<p>Same for Blue shift… Maybe there is less new stuff than in Op4, but still, I can see porting BS for Black Mesa just restrict us. We have our own vision of the remake and we are expecting some kind of freedom in creating these games (GD,OBM) and running under BM mod may just and only restrict us…</p>

<p>BM’s bullsquid seem to use it’s tail as a ‘third’ leg, so balancing could hardly be an issue.</p>
<p>OBM’s bullsquid on the other hand, has far too small thighs, which makes it seem implausible that the damn thing could even lift itself.</p>

            <p>I’m sure someone will try to recreate Uplink and Hazard Course as non-standalone maps for Black Mesa (much like custom single-player maps for Half-Life 2). I can’t say the same for Opposing Force and Blue Shift. I understand your point, but using BM’s assets won’t be the best for those mods.</p>

            <p>Isn’t that exactly what I’ve been saying!!! That there’s a lot more involved for a small mod team to do a remake of Uplink. That they’d have to model/texture/animate/code almost all of the HL1 enemies/NPCs and weapons.</p>
<p>In fact, this IS exactly what I’ve said.</p>

<p>Seriously, I appreciate what these mods try to do, but I just think it’s stupid not to make their game a mod to BMS. They can still do a lot of work before BMS’ release, they can orange map the levels, and they can make whatever assets that BMS will not have (new enemies, weapons, etc…).</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that when BMS is released, either the existing Op4/BS teams will use the assets, or new teams will see that this would be much easier than to make it all from scratch.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sorry, but this will never happen. There is a lot more involved than you can realize.</p>

            <p>I guess I should’ve said “possible” rather than realistic, since obviously, aliens cant’ be considered realistic. However, I can actually imagine that mod’s Bullsquid hopping around in real life, while I fail to see how the Bullsquid in HL and BMS could even stand up for more than 5 minute.</p>
<p>This is, of course going by the rules of evolution, where the best design prevails in the end. The original Bullsquid’s feet are way too tiny to allow the head and tail to be in balance of eachother, it might be possible and the Bullsquid’s legs might be strong enough to balance it out, but that would require too much effort for it to move around not only as a hunter, but as a prey as well.</p>
<p>The mod’s Bullsquid has bigger feet, longer tail and a head+body that feels a lot less heavy. I can imagine a beast like that existing, while the original… Well, the original looks like it came out of a bad sci-fi movie (probably the only (well, + the houndeyes) creatures in HL that really mde no sense to me).</p>

            <p>So, we don’t know about its internal anatomy, you can’t just look at their outer appearance and think you know all about it. And Earth isn’t its original home either.</p>
<p>And, and… it’s a video game, you could say that any of the aliens are unrealistic.</p>

            <p>I like that Bullsquid more than BM’s tbh. It may not be true to the original model, but at least it looks “realistic” in terms of anatomy and balancing capabilities. In BM (and the original game), Bullsquids looked like they could fall over any moment.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Lord</span> Grievous: You sound like you dont like the other projects? Its better that they stay their own, then using the mapping part of black mesa. That way they each have their own feel to it, because lets face it who doesn’t like a little variety. If I saw the same houndeyes, bullsquids, HECU Marines, Assassins, and all the other models, I’d get pretty bored, like how I did with Blue Shift and Opposing Force. Now granite they were both great games, just I didnt like how they recycled the models. With each mod being different they each have their own swing to it, and they all have talented Coders so that is out of the question.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I do like the other projects, I just think it’s stupid for the Uplink team to not wait for BMS to release. Would it really be worth it to have to wait 2-3 years on a mod that you can clear out in less than an hour?</p>
<p>As for the Op4 and BS Source remakes, I’d rather not wait another 5-6 years for these mods to finish. The Op4 mod could use about 60% of all the BMS assets (props, textures, sounds, etc… ) as well as all of the NPCs and enemies. This would mean they’d still have to do all the Race X aliens from scratch and all of the new weapons, and about 30% of the map props and textures for levels that weren’t in the original (like Biodome).</p>
<p>The BS remake could use about 95% of the BMS assets since it doesn’t have any new weapons or enemies and it doesn’t have any new gameplay mechanic.</p>
<p>Seriously, I appreciate what these mods try to do, but I just think it’s stupid not to make their game a mod to BMS. They can still do a lot of work before BMS’ release, they can orange map the levels, and they can make whatever assets that BMS will not have (new enemies, weapons, etc…).</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that when BMS is released, either the existing Op4/BS teams will use the assets, or new teams will see that this would be much easier than to make it all from scratch.</p>
<p>Also, have you seen the Op4 version of the bullsquid and shock trooper? I much prefer the BMS version any day of the week <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>

<p>They should just wait until BMS is released and then make it a mod to BMS using its assets. Same goes for the Op4 and BS remakes. That way we’ll also get a more consistent look between the different Source remakes of HL1 and its expansions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Maybe this is the some right way. But it is impossible to mod finished BMS because the integrity of mapcycle…</p>
<p>I talked about the FULL integrate the Uplink back into main story. This requires a huge buch of changes in other maps and scripts, and design concept (Lambda Complex entrance and other).</p>
<p>Normal scripting and voicerecording not take too much time (there just a few phrases), maybe one or two month.</p>
<p>But if you say “no”, its means “no”.</p>
<p>P.S. Oh, forget about Uplink Source. Its dead.</p>
