    <title>&quot;The Illusion of Free choice&quot; Coming back to Half life 3?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-illusion-of-free-choice-coming-back-to-half-life-3/11359</link>
    <description>I listened to enough dev comentaries in-game to know that valve loves to reuse their old concepts for half life games

So what if half life 3 presented gordon with the choice to destroy the borealis or use it against the combine and face any consequent consequences
(just like how gordon in hl1 was given a &quot;decision&quot; to accept GMAN&#39;s job offering, or succome to a mass Agrunt rape)

the alledged [color=lime]return to xen may foreshadow such a returning concept.  But it is still unknown if gordon will assault the overworld from xen or just have a lone battle with whatever he has to encounter (from what i seen in the concept art leak on the day of Meet the pyro, there is somthing else gordon will encounter either far worse than advisors or somthing higher up in the combine; or maybe the advisor&#39;s final form in metamorphesus, as it is a larva creature)</description>

            <p>oh wait wait wait… I wouldn’t build my hopes on these old concept arts. It could be that Valve long ditched the Possibility of a Return to Xen. There is so much misinformation or simply trolling about HL3 these days I don’t take any news seriously as long as the source is validated. There ARE Xen Concept arts, so it is likely we will see something related, but no one (from Valve or who has insight into development) ever said explicitly we WILL return to Xen.</p>

<p>Oh. In that case, I’d say it would be an okay idea, depending on how they carried it out. If it was a little homage to the original scene that would be quite cool.</p>
