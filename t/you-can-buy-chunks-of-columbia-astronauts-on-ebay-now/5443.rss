<p>Hey, Bolteh.</p>
<p>You’re being an Asshole.</p>
<p>I hate having ADHD; it gives me uncontrollable impulses. It has nothing to do with “today’s youth,” because the symptoms you attribute to both are different that those of ADHD.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Basically.</p>
<p>Bolteh, your logic/inferrance/whatever fails.</p>
<p>My parents were both born in the 40s.  I was born in the 80s.</p>
<p>My father is an asshole, but he’s probably one of the smartest people you could ever meet.  He was an engineer in the Navy for years, and helped with Admiral Rickover’s nuclear submarine program, and then worked for the US Department of Energy for over 20 years.</p>
<p>My mother brought me up well, helped me learn good values.  She never drank or smoked because of her religion.  She doesn’t even drink coffee or tea.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in middle school.  I’m not near as smart as my father was before he started to go senile, and he’s still probably smarter than me, even though he doesn’t show it.</p>
<p>I was never the best student, but I always knew what the teachers were talking about.  I was just fucking lazy and didn’t do my homework, so my grades weren’t that great.  In high school geometry, some of the other students would ask me how to work out the answer to whatever problem the teacher was going over, and aside from the very beginning of a unit, I always knew the answer way before the teacher got to it.  And I almost never took notes or did the work on paper, I just did it all in my head.</p>
<p>Maybe I don’t have ADHD, but I can see how teachers thought I wasn’t paying attention.  I was paying attention, but I was always bored because I got it right away, when only a few of the other kids ever did before it was drilled into them 10 or more times.</p>

            <p>Did you ever think that maybe ADD is a legitimate affliction and was dismissed previously due to lack of scientific backing.  I don’t think there has been a single generation that didn’t have hyper active kids.  They’re fucking children they’re hyper.  However what if what has previously been known as hyperactivity resulting from bad parenting and sugar has ALWAYS been ADD but people where too ignorant to accept that it could be something other than what they thought it was?  Its also interesting to hear a lot of stuff about bad parenting from someone who hasn’t had a kid.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So all of you ADHD crusaders, have you actually read up on what may cause ADHD, or at least “enhance” it?</p>
<p>The cause is most likely genetic (or drug/alcohol abuse during pregnancy), but can also be caused by a specific diet (sugar and coffee for example), and social environment. And even if those things didn’t directly cause ADHD, they most definitely will enhance the symptoms.</p>
<p>So yes, more often that not, ADHD is caused or enhanced by bad parenting, lack of education, and lack of discipline.</p>
<p>What parent exposes his kid to cigarettes, alcohol or drugs? What parent exposes his kid to domestic violence? What parent exposes his kid to social drama and general FUBAR situations? What parent lets his kid do whatever the fuck it wants to do, and even allow it to talk back to you? A bad parent allows all of that, and it’s those things that can cause or enhance ADHD.</p>
<p>And yes Burb, I realize that, and I know plenty of people who don’t have it. But does that change anything about the fact that most cases of ADHD that are “diagnosed” are causes by shitty parenting? It does not.</p>
<p>PS: I also know people that supposedly have ADHD, and they don’t go around acting like someone who has ADHD, they don’t put a disclaimer on their forehead saying “yo guise, i has ADHD so forgive me for being a huge fucking cunt”, they don’t use ADHD as an excuse to be retarded.</p>

<p>My point wasn’t “because it didn’t exist xx years ago, it’s made up”, my point was that when the generation of lazy punkass younglings spawned, ADHD and ADD popped up en mass.</p>
<p>So what do we have? Parents that grew up in the 70s and early 80s, parents that weren’t allowed to do anything wild by <span class="bbcode-i">their</span> parents. So they have kids in the early 90s and don’t want their kids to go through the same shit they went through.Enter a generation where kids are raised with complete freedom and spoiled lifestyles.</p>
<p>And then… Woop! Shit hits the fan, kids are uncontrollable idiots, parents go “wtf, what is this? Surely it has nothing to do with our bad parenting… Surely… No?”, claim their kid must have some sort of mental condition, go to the doctor, cry their hearts out, doctor smells money, says “Yes, your son has ehm… <em>browses through latest magazine of “Doc”</em> … Ah here, your son has A, ehm… A, D… H, D! Yes, ADHD, that seems to be all the rage today. Here have some prescription for drugs to ease your kid!”.</p>
<p>And about dyslexia, there’s a difference between “brain reads things backwards or wrong or phonetically” and “kid just lacks discipline, education and control”.</p>

</aside>
<p>I repeat, there are <span class="bbcode-i">plenty</span> of people born and raised in the 90s (i.e. my generation) that aren’t out of control, aren’t spoiled, aren’t brats, etc.</p>
<p>I think this is a classic case of ‘today’s youth’, only from a person too young to expect it from.</p>

            <p>The point is, unless you are a neurologist, you can never be sure if someone has a mental condition or not. Especially not on the internet, which makes asshats and trolls out of even normal people via the power of anonymity and the terrible form of communication that is text-based language.</p>

<p>Or, people had ADHD over 20 years ago, and just weren’t being diagnosed with it, and just being passed off as undisciplined and rambunctious, when they could have been medicated and helped.</p>

            <p>dyslexia wasn’t diagnosed until like 20 years ago either, does that mean it doesn’t exist? (<a class="mention" href="/u/bolteh">@bolteh</a>)</p>

            <p>his logic is faulty anyway (even if I do agree it is way over-diagnosed). just because a condition is first diagnosed 20 years ago doesn’t mean that no one had it longer ago. It just means there wasn’t a specific classification in the medical community for that specific set of symptoms.</p>
