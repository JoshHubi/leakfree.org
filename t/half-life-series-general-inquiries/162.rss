    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-series-general-inquiries/162</link>
    <description>Creating this thread for the quick questions regarding most anything in the Half-Life series to date.  This could be in regards to gameplay, continuity etc, but let&#39;s try and stay away from the questions that could raise debates, this thread really isn&#39;t for that.

For example, and this is actually a serious question of mine that I&#39;ve been wondering about for some time now.

Is it possible to destroy the striders with the Dark Energy Orb launcher (secondary fire) on the Pulse Rifle?

I assume that it is, mostly because of the Strider encounter in The Citadel, but all of my attempts have met little success, it&#39;s difficult to hit them with the slow moving orbs.

If this thread is redundant feel free to close or merge.</description>

            <p>tbh I would have preferred it if you started in your HEV suit…even though it wouldn’t make sense(seeing as how the mark V has better protection against bullets,etc.) it would be cool to hear people say stuff like ‘What the hell is that?’ or ‘is that some kind of CP?’. I know it would mess everything up, I just think it would be cool.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>@ CTID : I’d recognised that he interrupted the man, but I hadn’t thought that he was about to reveal something. It might have just been that the vort was so excited upon seeing Freeman. It wouldn’t really make sense that the man was about to say something that he wasn’t supposed to.</p>

            <p>I find it kind of odd when you jump into the rail car with the G-Man on the tv, and the guy and the vortigaunt are there. The man says, “You’re not the first one to show up-” and then the vortigaunt cuts off his words, as if the man was about to say something he shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>It could be just pure coincidence, and probably is, it’s just something I noticed out of the ordinary.</p>

 Super Toast:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Vortigaunts could have known, but that still leaves the question of Gordon’s HEV suit. If it is actually a modified version of the same suit Gordon wore in HL1, as we’re led to believe by Kleiner telling Gordon that it’s his old suit, how did Kleiner get it in the first place? The Vortigaunts could have managed to steal it somehow, since they apparently have access to whatever dimension the Gman uses to put Gordon in stasis, but I kind of doubt that.</p>
<p>I just hope Ep3 clarifies at least some of this.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, Eli knows G-man, and Kliener knows Eli… Do the math.<br>
Of course, I don’t know what story Eli would have told Kliener about where he got it, or even if Kliener cared. I’m certain that Eli got it from G-man.</p>

<p>I always figured that Eli and Kleiner had merely figured that Gordon was mucking about as a citizen and had just happened to wander through City 17. Several comments have been made about him just being the right man in the wrong place, or so some people might say.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Well yeah, he said ‘‘My, you haven’t changed one iota, how do you do it? <span class="bbcode-b">BACK TO BUSINEEEEESSSS!</span>’’. I thought it was odd that he didn’t really say anything about your unchanged apearance after 20 years.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Please understand that at that moment, Eli knew about Gordon’s return for several hours already (Red Letter Day - Route Canal - Water Hazard chapters), so he probably had enough time to think about how to properly “celebrate” Gordon’s return, when to brief him about the development on Earth, which is why he might have decided to postpone any info sessions to later, after something urgent is done. I can imagine that briefing Gordon about everything would take several hours, during which you would not like to be disturbed.</p>
<p>The fact that G-man informed the Resistance that Gordon will be returning may also explain why Barney was placed as “undercover” agent into CP; perhaps he volunteered just mere days or weeks before the arrival and was on constant lookout for Gordon. I can hardly imagine that he could work in CP for more than few weeks without becoming suspicious (“I’m way behind on my beating quota”…).</p>
<p>Events of Episode 2 would also suggest that Eli doesn’t like G-man, so maybe G-man did not inform Eli (or, rather, told everyone involved NOT to tell Eli…?) Which is why Kleiner says “I expected more warning”, while Eli says “That’s not who I think it is?” There’s a clear difference in their approach – one sort of expected Gordon, although not so sneakily, while the other might have already given up all hope of ever seeing him again.</p>
<p>Which returns us to Eli’s “welcome sentence” (about iotas <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) – perhaps Eli felt a little ashamed that he gave up on Gordon, and wasn’t entirely sure how to talk to him, so he used the “back to your lab coat” direction.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve thought about a similar theory. Perhaps it became obvious to the Gman that Eli “knew too much” and had to be killed or his/his employer’s plan would in some way be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>If the Gman does end up being the main adversary after Ep3 (Which is just a theory that could [and will probably] end up being very, very wrong), then revealing that he was behind Eli’s death in some way could be a good way to try to make sure that the player would likely begin to feel animosity towards the Gman, since right now he’s not really viewed as anything more than an enigmatic observer (and occasional interloper) by many players.</p>
<p>(Discussing all of this is kind of fun, eh? No one I know in real life is quite as nerdy as me when it comes to the HL universe, so it’s rare that I get to discuss the plot with anyone.)</p>

            <p>I’m thinking G-man probably told Eli about Gordon’s return just prior to the events of HL2, considering they (G-man and Eli) already knew each other from Black Mesa. Eli probably told Kleiner and Barney etc.</p>
<p>G-Man may have also been behind Eli’s death… trying to prevent Eli telling you what he intended to at the end of Episode 2. Whether that was by distracting DOG or simply luring advisors into the hanger is up to further speculation though. Not that it really matters…</p>

            <p>^ Seems a bit farfetched doesn’t it? The suit would have been custom-made specifically for Gordon. Even <span class="bbcode-i">if</span> Kleiner somehow managed to get a suit out of Black Mesa whilst being chased by aliens and the HECU, how could they be sure it fit Gordon? It seems far more likely that they were given Gordon’s old suit and simply upgraded it. Also, he says “Gordon, I trust your HEV suit still fits you like a glove, well, at least the glove parts,” or something to that extent. It might not explicitly say that the suit was the same as in HL1, but it more or less does.</p>

            <p>The HEV suit Gordon wore in HL1 was not the only one of it’s kind, and Kleiner never say it was Gordon’s suit in particular. Kleiner could have gotten one of the other suits. Somehow.</p>
<p>As for Gordon not wearing the HEV suit when he leaves the train in HL2: it would probably attract a lot of unwanted attention from the Combine.<br>
G-Man is probably keeping Gordon’s Mark IV in his little harm-free dimension.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Vortigaunts could have known, but that still leaves the question of Gordon’s HEV suit. If it is actually a modified version of the same suit Gordon wore in HL1, as we’re led to believe by Kleiner telling Gordon that it’s his old suit, how did Kleiner get it in the first place? The Vortigaunts could have managed to steal it somehow, since they apparently have access to whatever dimension the Gman uses to put Gordon in stasis, but I kind of doubt that.</p>
<p>I just hope Ep3 clarifies at least some of this.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I would imagine that the G-Man is only vulnerable to the vortigaunts when he’s in our own dimension. When he takes his subjects away, he takes them somewhere where “[they] can do no possible harm, and where no harm will come to [them],” and I’m sure that he was well aware of the dangers, if not directly of the vortigaunts, as he seems genuinely surprised by them in Episode One, then at least of teleportation and its risks.</p>
<p>The whole suit business is probably not a huge issue to Valve and just a plot device that won’t be continued or explained in Episode 3, but I see no reason why the G-Man wouldn’t be able to deliver it himself, or leave it somewhere for someone to find. That might not mean that he knocked on Kleiner’s door and introduced himself, but there are many ways he could have gotten the suit to him. I would probably imagine that the suit was his proof that Freeman was alive.</p>

            <p>Valve had Gordon start out without his HEV suit for the purpose of story/gameplay. They didn’t want Gordon to begin, walking around, in his HEV suit when geting off the train. So they simply had him in regular clothes.</p>
<p>It isn’t something people were meant to think about / give a shit about I guess.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>But they knew he was alive at the very least, and for them to still be able to understand the situation they must have been told that he would arrive at some point. Neither Kleiner nor Eli seemed overly surprised to see Gordon. Kleiner just goes “My goodness, Gordon Freeman. I expected more warning,” whilst Eli simply goes “That’s not who I think it is, is it?” With a timespan of 10 years at the least and 20+ years at the most, you would have thought that if they <span class="bbcode-i">hadn’t</span> been warned that Freeman was coming, they would have said more than the equivalent of “oh it’s you.”</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, like I said in my original post, they seemed more surprised with the <span class="bbcode-i">timing</span> of his return rather than the fact that he returned <span class="bbcode-i">at all.</span> Kleiner saying that he “expected more warning” backs that up a bit.</p>
