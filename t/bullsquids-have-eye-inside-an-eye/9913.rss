    <title>Bullsquids have eye inside an eye?</title>

You can see clearly that an eyeball is inside an eye that the player actually sees. I doubt that this is intended, and it seems bullsquid&#39;s eye position was changed very shortly before release, so that might contribute to this... bug? I saw this on maxed-out video settings.
@EDIT
Now I am thinking that this could be the eye gib that falls from bullsquid (I didn&#39;t gib any bullsquid yet so I&#39;m just guessing that), but nevertheless it looks awkward.</description>

            <p>Well, if it’s necessary for engine to look around, why couldn’t they make the inner eyeball invisible?</p>

            <p>I noticed that too… But it does have to look around, so it kinda makes sense…</p>

            <p>one of the “eyeballs” seem to be specular mapping, hence why they change position unrealative to the actual eye</p>
<p>same bug happens to ichysaur in hl2</p>
<p>so blame valve</p>
