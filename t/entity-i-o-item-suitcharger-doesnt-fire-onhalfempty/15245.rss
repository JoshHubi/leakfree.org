    <title>[Entity I/O] item_suitcharger doesn&#39;t fire OnHalfEmpty</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/entity-i-o-item-suitcharger-doesnt-fire-onhalfempty/15245</link>
    <description>Says it all in the title, really. OnEmpty fires just fine, but OnHalfEmpty doesn&#39;t get called when the suit charger is, well, half empty. Not a huge issue since it&#39;s never used in the campaign or official MP maps, but any level designer wanting to use this output will have to use a workaround with OnUse and a (high max value) math_counter.</description>
