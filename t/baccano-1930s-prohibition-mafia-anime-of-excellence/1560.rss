You know how there are some animes where you just stand around looking at scenery?  Yeah, Baccano doesn&#39;t really do that except when it comes to violence.  It&#39;s actually pretty brutal and is rated M for Mature audiences.  But it&#39;s also mature in the sense of telling a very elaborate story through the viewpoints of an ensemble cast that represents a wide spectrum of interesting and intelligent characters.

            <p>He didn’t say it was bad. He simply said ‘Fuck Hulu’, and he said it because he can’t easily use it, which would make it a bad service in his eyes.</p>
<p>it would be akin to me saying ‘To Hell Angelina Jolie. She won’t have sex with me.’  Doesn’t mean the sex is bad, but I’m saying to hell with her, because I can’t tap 'dat ass.</p>

<p>Anyway, I might watch this.  It’s kinda hard to peg it for violence, though.  The intro seems pretty light-hearted.</p>
<p>I mean, are we talking Elfen Lied violence or more slapstick violence?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the first episode, someone is shot directly in the head making for a mess.  You see someone grip a knife and when the knife’s pulled back, a couple of fingers come off as well.</p>
<p>I never saw Elfen Lied, but after using this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx61G_thXWM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">random AMV video</a> as a reference, I have to say that Baccano isn’t quite that violent.  But it does come close on a fairly regular basis.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s like Hollywood making a movie about the history of another country.</p>
<p>Especially a time period that featured such things as violence, intrigue, betryal, and multiple allies and enemies.</p>

<p>Wait I don’t think that is the same thing.</p>
<p>Mostly I’m just trying to say there are plenty of services that are denied because of world location.  But that’s life.</p>

<p>You know how there are some animes where you just stand around looking at scenery?  Yeah, Baccano doesn’t really do that except when it comes to violence.  It’s actually pretty brutal and is rated M for Mature audiences.  But it’s also mature in the sense of telling a very elaborate story through the viewpoints of an ensemble cast that represents a wide spectrum of interesting and intelligent characters.</p>
