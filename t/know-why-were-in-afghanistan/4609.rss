    <title>Know Why Were In Afghanistan?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/know-why-were-in-afghanistan/4609</link>
    <description>Do you know why were in Afghanistan? Its not because of the Taliban, or because of al qaeda. Its because we found Lithium there, so all their interested in is mining it out and making more batteries. We should leave Afghanistan TODAY!!!! I hate all of those ignorant republicans who say that if we leave there, that they will just come over here. Well if we hadn&#39;t of gone over there in the first place this dirty little war wouldn&#39;t be happening.</description>

<p>Let me pose you a question: Why would the USSR want to overthrow the Daoud regime? Why they invaded in 1979 is a different question, since then they had a valid security concern, but why did, under your hypothesis of absurdities, did it do it then?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I should cry about your “ad hominem attacks” rather than responding to this, but the Daoud  government Russia had helped to install (via planning and supporting the coup, not directly as per your straw man) was insufficiently friendly towards Russia and was making overtures towards the West, therefore the Kremlin “supported” (again, this is a quote from evidence you specifically cited) the overthrow in favor of an even more friendly regime. For a historical example of how a friendly client states leadership will be changed when it becomes inconvenient, see: Diem’s regime/regime change in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Since you have focused on a straw man, I’ll clarify what I’m saying. I’m saying that political instability in Afghanistan was fomented by Russian interests and these coups were carried out with Russian support.<span class="bbcode-b"> I’m not saying Russia somehow directly overthrew the Afghan monarchy through direct military action. </span><br>
Again, what your sources tell you is that Russia was intimately involved in every significant political development in Afghanistan from 1973 until they invaded. During every change in government, each time resulting in a government friendlier to the USSR than the previous one, your sources specifically point out a Russian connection in planning, supporting, arming, and training coups.<br>
What exactly are we disagreeing about here?</p>

<p>My god, you really are unbelievably and completely intolerably bigoted, aren’t you. On the one hand you attempt to criticise me for having ill-formed opinions based on nothing but fallacy, and yet at the same time you “guess” about particular points of history and ignore pretty much everything I write. I know that convincing you of your own fallacy is patently impossible, but hopefully others wont fall into the trap of believing what you write.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Your contention, as weird and fantastic as it has become, is that as a result of some junior officers in the army helping in carrying out the takeover which overthrew a fundamentally undemocratic government, and the fact that the Communist Party in Afghanistan liased with some of the USSR’s security officers, therefore the 1978 Saur revolution was a coup by the USSR. Aside from the fact that the <span class="bbcode-i">exact same source</span> said that the 1978 coup/revolution <span class="bbcode-i">wasn’t</span> a USSR takeover (a fact that you skillfully avoided talking about by completely ignoring). Your analysis ignores the point that the US actively hoped to win over the Communist Party precisely because they knew that it wasn’t just a USSR puppet.</p>
<p>It also ignores the fact (which I haven’t explored in the past) which is that the USSR obtained permission to enter the country only after they entered and replaced the government. Two days after they killed and replaced the leader, he <span class="bbcode-i">then</span> asked for their help. If the Afghan government was just a puppet of the USSR, then why didn’t they just stroll in as though nothing was out of the ordinary?</p>
<p>Also: The fact that they replaced Amin with someone from his own party proves nothing; the Afghan government had very little, if any, control over the country after the invasion. Mostly because the USSR troops dissolved the Afghan army almost completely.</p>
<p>Let me pose you a question: Why would the USSR want to overthrow the Daoud regime? Why they invaded in 1979 is a different question, since then they had a valid security concern, but why did, under your hypothesis of absurdities, did it do it then?</p>

</aside>
<p>And let’s sort out this whole coup/revolution thing. Frankly, I think the distinction is somewhat moot, mainly because the terminology doesn’t prove anything one way or the other and its absolutely irrelevant for the purposes of this thread. I called it a revolution mainly because that’s its name; the Saur <span class="bbcode-b">Revolution</span>. Presumably as part of a ploy by the Communist Party to legitimise their takeover of power as ‘popular’.</p>
<p>While I could list examples of where the distinction between a coup and a revolution is blurred, I think its irrelevant here; the people, very quickly, came to hate the Communist Party (the main reason why the Russians invaded), and their system of government wasn’t democratic in the slightest. The only reason it was relevant was because you were contending that it overthrew a democratic government, which it didn’t, so the entire point is, as I said, moot.</p>

            <p>Ok, we’ll wrap this it up then. I took a look at the quotes and links you’ve provided, and hey, looks like I learned a thing or two about Afghanistan’s history of outside intervention (which by the way <span class="bbcode-i">couldn’t possibly be more relevant </span>to the topic of this thread, “why are we in Afghanistan”). I guessed that Daoud’s coup was democratic, oops, according to the link you provided, quote, “<span class="bbcode-b">the coup itself was carried out by junior officers trained in the Soviet Union</span>.” My mistake! And hey, I didn’t even know that it was common knowledge that the '78 coup was planned, quote, “<span class="bbcode-b">with support from Soviet intelligence</span> officers” so thanks for pointing that out. You’ve really blown your own argument* out of the water - unless you have any other positions you’d like to debunk, I think we’re done here.</p>

            <p>Okay, this is the last time I’m even going to bother engaging with you on this topic. Mostly because its so ridiculously far away from the entire <span class="bbcode-i">point</span> of this thread that its not worth talking about any more. That and your endless plethora of ad hominem attacks cause me to beat my head into the table, and the constant concussion-related hospitalisations are proving a hefty burden on my family.</p>

<p>In this case, the afghan army was supplied by the USSR, the “civilian government” had strong ties to the USSR, the “local communist party” had strong ties to the USSR. Sure, the Russians deposed the head of the civilian government when they invaded, but they also installed one of the founding members of the supposedly “local” communist party to replace him as the figurehead.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Okay, I agree with your premise that the Saur revolution was carried out by the army. But here is where you run into problems: You continually assert that the Afghan Army was, in fact, run and controlled by the USSR, that the Afghan Communist Party was effectively the Politburo and that Afghanistan was nothing more than a satellite state for the USSR. Here are a series of direct quotes from ‘A Bitter Harvest: US Foreign Policy and Afghanistan’ by Tom Lansford:</p>
<p>“The leadership of the PDPA, with support from Soviet intelligence officers, had been planning a coup for some time. In 1977, the two main Communist factions, Khalif and Parcham, agreed to cooperate in order to topple the regime.”</p>
<p>“…the coup was not a Soviet-sponsored exercise in regime change.” (p 115)</p>
<p>“In the aftermath of the coup, the United States in particular sought to maintain a relationship with the new government.” (p. 118)</p>
<p>“American policy would remain cautious until February of 1979 when its new ambassador, Adolph Dubbs was kidnapped in Kabul. Dubbs was held hostage in a hotel and killed along with his two captors when Afghan police, under the direction of Soviet advisors, fired into the room in an effort to rescue him…The Carter administration curtailed aid and withdrew the Peace Corps.” (p. 120)</p>
<p>If it was a cut-and-dry USSR-sponsored coup, <span class="bbcode-i">why did US give them aid and send in the Peace Corps</span>?</p>

</aside>
<p>This is how every coup in history works. The military decides they don’t like the democratic government, so they remove them by force and install martial law. Shortly after, the military government installs a “civilian” puppet government typically through sham elections. The puppet government acts democratic superficially, but the final authority always rests with the military. In this way, the gullible and ignorant can plausibly claim that there was no coup, and the whole episode was simply an exercise in democracy. This relies on people<a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=5900&amp;page=4J" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">conveniently “forgetting”</a> that the military takeover ever happened, and as we can see from this conversation it’s a highly effective tactic.</p>
<p>In this case, the afghan army was supplied by the USSR, the “civilian government” had strong ties to the USSR, the “local communist party” had strong ties to the USSR. Sure, the Russians deposed the head of the civilian government when they invaded, but they also installed one of the founding members of the supposedly “local” communist party to replace him as the figurehead.</p>
<p>This is not “proposing an alternate viewpoint,” this is pointing out how <span class="bbcode-b">historical fact</span> proves that what you are saying is at best false and at worst a deliberate distortion to support your bizarre insistence that the democratic overthrow of a monarchy is a coup, but a military takeover of civilian government is a “revolution.”</p>

<p>My lord you just don’t stop do you? I was studying for exams back then so I didn’t notice your post.</p>
<p>So, right, let’s get to it.</p>
<p>The 1973 overthrow was, as you have correctly pointed out, a coup. The 1978 Saur revolution was not, however, a coup; it was a revolution carried out by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Democratic_Party_of_Afghanistan" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">local communist party</a>.</p>
<p>The 1978 Coup was not supported by the USSR. It was a native Communist Party who rose up completely separately from either the US or the USSR. As a result, nobody knew what on earth was going on. It wasn’t until about 6 months later when the USSR and the new government signed a non-aggression pact that the US got wind that something strange was up. When the USSR instructed a bunch of Afghani police to open fire on a US ambassador who was being held hostage, they knew that they certainly weren’t going to be buddies.</p>
<p>Funny story: When the USSR invaded and installed their own government, did you know what they did to the old guy? They killed him. Why? Because it wasn’t just a case of the USSR being asked to go in; they invaded to stop the native Islamic movement from taking over and spreading their interests to the USSR’s other Arab-dominated interests. They killed off the old leader not because he asked for the USSR to come in, but because they forcefully came in to protect their own interests.</p>
<p>Just because you propose an alternative viewpoint to me doesn’t make yours right, and even if you are it doesn’t mean that you get the right to be a self-righteous git about it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In an exploratory attempt to form instantaneous travel, two Soviet airliners, while taking off seventeen minutes apart from the same runway, were erased from history in an experiment gone awry late spring of 1981, only to mysteriously and tragically reappear in September 2001, roughly 7,750 kilometers over the Earth’s magnetic north pole in New York City.</p>
<p>After the failure the project was deemed a waste of funding, and the equipment was put into storage and eventually sold to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan along with various other containers of mechanical surplus much needed by the materiel-short regime. It was lost over time, and American agents maintained a small level of information regarding the experiment - - not its precise nature, but where it was, when it was canceled, and where its equipment ended up.</p>
<p>A plot of terrorism was concocted after the disaster to placate any Russian memories of their two lost airframes, with an entry into Afghanistan (to obtain and resurrect this assumed-worthless technology). When American intentions in Afghanistan began to be questioned, a distraction was staged along the Euphrates.</p>
<p>Estimates for a pullout of Afghanistan are based on how soon the last of the equipment is expected to be tracked down. It will be buried innocently in the withdrawal’s myriad shipments.</p>

</aside>
<p>No one said the Taliban is a global terrorist group, but the reality is that they are using terrorist methodology to attack a percieved invader. I’m not saying if that’s correct or not, it’s just the truth.</p>
<p>The main reason foreign armies there was because the international community disagreed with the extreme policies of the Taliban government. Naturally the Taliban thinks they were doing a fine job so they’re trying to regain power.</p>

            <p>Well technically they are fighting terrorism, in the broad sense of the word. US troops were fighting terrorists in Vietnam, and the South African Nationalist Party was fighting anti-apartheid terrorists as well. You’re only manipulated by the US government (or just plain ignorant) if you think the word “terrorist” means some Arab bloke blowing himself up in a city square.</p>
<p>Currently most of the forces in Afghanistan are fighting a terrorist enemy, whether it be direct combat with militia or convincing the population to stand against them.</p>
