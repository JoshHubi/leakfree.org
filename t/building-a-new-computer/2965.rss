    <description>I&#39;ve never done this before, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing stuff but here&#39;s what I have so far:

Tower: [url]https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811133089[/url]
Suggested Tower: [url]https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119077&amp;cm_re=Cooler_Master-_-11-119-077-_-Product[/url]

[COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]Suggested Hard-Drive: [url]https://hitachigst.pgpartner.com/search_getprod.php/vcode=HIT/partnum=0A34193/[/url]

Power Supply: [url]https://www.antec.com/Detail.bok?no=567[/url]
Other Power Supply: [url]https://www.corsair.com/products/hx1000/default.aspx[/url]
Power Supply recommended as an &quot;Upgrade&quot; to my current one according to google searches: [url]https://www.atxpowersupplies.com/1200-watt-atx-power-supply-Magna-1200.php?psu=Magna1200-NPS-750AB-1B[/url]

[COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]OS: Windows 7 x64 Home Premium 

What I already own:
250gb hard-drive
750watt Power Supply
Power Strip
DVD-RW
2 DDR3 Memory Sticks (Possibly 2GB each I think)

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]Estimated Cost: $3855.97
[COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]Update: I recalculated the price. If I use the cheaper items people suggested and do not use CrossFireX: [COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]$1716
If I do 2 cards and a new Power Supply it&#39;s: [COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]$2603 

Obviously wasn&#39;t going for cost effective. It&#39;s still cheaper than anything Alienware will sell you, so it can&#39;t be a complete rip-off. I&#39;ll probably worry about making it more cost effective once I figure out that I have all the parts and understand what I need and how it all works.

Update: Just checked, my current computer cost $3,871. 
[COLOR=&#39;Yellow&#39;]Note: As long as my new computer doesn&#39;t jump too much higher than this price, the cost is irrelevant. 

Anyway, mostly wondering what I&#39;m missing and if there&#39;s anything there that won&#39;t work. 

Other Questions: 
1) If I plan on using DDR3 Memory Sticks each 4GB, and I already own 2 DDR3 1GB ones, can I use them together to get 10GB as long as they are all DDR3 even though the sizes are different? [COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]Answered

2) I was looking at AMD processors because I was looking at the ATI Graphics cards and have heard mixed things about using Intel and Nvidia mixed with ATI and AMD. Are there any issues with getting AMD instead of the standard Intel? [COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]Answered

3) I can&#39;t find a sound-card in my current computer, if I plan on just using a generic 2 speaker set-up and a headset, do I need to purchase a fancy sound card? [COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]Answered

4) Do I need to worry about any cooling system or will whatever comes in the tower I buy be sufficient? [COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]Answered

5) Should I worry at all about what Overclocking is? [COLOR=&#39;SeaGreen&#39;]Answered</description>

            <p>Ah, cool. Nothing was more frustrating with Windows Vista than having to change compatibility mode, turn off DEP, fiddle with security settings, trying running in window mode, etc.</p>
<p>Edit: Couple more cases:<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/NewProduct.aspx?Item=N82E16811103033" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/NewProduct.aspx?Item=N82E16811103033</a><br>

<p>Dad gets home from business trip tomorrow and that might be when I start ordering things, so final opinions are needed.</p>
<p>Double Edit: I just took a closer look at my PSU and ends up I should have enough connectors. It appears a vast majority of the connectors have been tied up and hidden within all the cords but if I cut off all the restraining ties that were put on when the computer was made it should work nicely.</p>

            <p>I’ve had Windows 7 on my computer for a couple months and haven’t had any problems with compatibility whatsoever.</p>
<p>Oldest game I’ve run on it is Deus Ex (2000), runs perfectly with no tweaking. You should be fine.</p>

            <p>Well, as long as x64 won’t cause any compatibility issues and Windows 7 isn’t any harder to get backwards compatible than Vista I shouldn’t have too much trouble. It takes some fiddling, but Vista could be made to do stuff… with the exception of reading a video camera for a school project that was due in sometime in the next two days. (Grrrr) That would be the reason for me to have a “back-up” OS, for those rare but important situations where something isn’t compatible.</p>

            <p>You have to be playing some pretty old games if they won’t run in vista or 7. However, I was talking about hardware, and productivity software, not games.</p>

<p>Unless I’m mistaken, hibernation technically powers the computer down altogether after storing session information on the hard drive. Sleep mode, on the other hand, stores the information in RAM. This is why you can put your computer into hibernation, unplug it from the wall, plug it back in and still continue where you left off, whereas unplugging your computer after putting it to sleep will make you loose any unsaved session data.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh, well then, nevermind. I don’t keep my computer on 24/7 after all. I’ll let it go into sleep mode if I just step away, but over-night or if I plan on being away for a good while I’ll always hibernate it. Since I didn’t trust my computer I never trusted turning it off. Once I got it working I figured KEEP IT WORKING. Probably poor logic, but whatever.</p>
<p>Ok, back to the two OS’s thing. Will having an x64 computer cause much compatibility issues? I occasionally like to purchase “retro” games such as THIEF and System Shock 2 and wasn’t sure if they would still run on an x64 computer.</p>

            <p>You can have 2+ operating systems on one harddrive, you just need to partition it properly. I think they have to be on one hdd, the bootloader only loads from the primary hdd.</p>

</aside>
<p>Unless I’m mistaken, hibernation technically powers the computer down altogether after storing session information on the hard drive. Sleep mode, on the other hand, stores the information in RAM. This is why you can put your computer into hibernation, unplug it from the wall, plug it back in and still continue where you left off, whereas unplugging your computer after putting it to sleep will make you loose any unsaved session data.</p>

<p>Well sort of. No patter what when you have a second card occupying a PCI express slot the primary will switch from x16 to x8. On some cheaper board there will be a mini PCI x4 slot, like the MSI P55 CD53. Those mini PCIexpress slots are mainly designed for sound cards and other small peripherals. If you have a large card like a 5970, this single slot being brought down to x8 so that you can use the second pathways is a bit of a limitation.<br>
Here is the diagram of the P55 design:<br>

It’s possible that board makers might have tweaked things on lower end boards, but it’s not a chipset limitation, and I can’t think of an example off the top of my head. But yeah it’s possible that a budget board might put a restriction like that, for some reason.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok, yeah, that’s what I mean. Most boards that I’ve seen below about $150 have an x16 slot and then one or two x4 slots, so obviously those x4 slots wouldn’t somehow become x8 slots even though the x16 slot becomes an x8 slot. The articles I’ve seen say that running two 5870s in CF on P55 costs you about 4% performance compared to X58, assuming you have two 16 lane slots and not the 4 lane slots.</p>

<p>Don’t you leave your computer on 24/7? You don’t expect it to be using 250W on idle, do you? In practice, your computer will only spend the maximum wattage is when you are using everything to its full potencial, e.g., when you are gaming.

<p>You don’t need to worry to much with this, it just isn’t recommended to buy a PSU with a too much higher wattage then you need, otherwise you will waste your money… twice. While the efficiency at 25% to 90% of load is more than 80% on a good PSU, you can’t expect that below 25%.</p>

<p>A big benefit of the GD65 is the OC Genie. Since it sounds like you aren’t comfortable with overclocking I suggest this as an interesting option. You don’t DO anything. Just press a button on the motherboard, and it overclocks itself. If you are looking at the i5 750 with a stock cooler, I’ve seen results range from 3.2 - 3.4GHz depending on the memory used. Asus, and gigabyte both have something similar, but neither are as seamless, and their options are both OS based.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True, but it doesn’t look like it has some of those useful “quick fix” features such as MemOK! that the other board has. I’m not saying I’ll necessarily need those or rely on them, but it’s reassuring to know things like that are on the board. Also, looking around with Google it looks like the ASUS can be bought for cheaper.</p>

            <p>Correct me if I’m wrong max, but not all P55 mobos will split into x8x8. Cheaper ones will split into x4 slots, which will hurt performance significantly as compared to x8.</p>

            <p>With what you are using your load wattage is going to be &lt;300W drawn from the wall, you might breach the 300W mark with multiple hard drives, and a lot of fans, but the new fab process in the AMD GPUs are very efficient. I have tested this on about 7 systems now ranging from the i5 750, to the i7 940.</p>
<p>The antec 1200 is a decent, if a little loud, case. It has excellent air flow, but no real noise dampening. Setting the fans to low is still better than most cases air flow, and still reasonably quiet. When set to high the fans are…quite noticeable, but airflow is significant.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about the antec 1200 is you can buy a proprietary PSU for it that is designed for the case. The Antec CP-850 CP Series 850W is an amazing modular PSU ( which is actually using the components of the Antec signature series PSUs ) . Simple remove the bracket and you have a nice PSU that usually sells for reasonably cheap. The drawback is that it is basically tied to the case, it’s design won’t fit in most any other case.</p>

<p>Just want to point this out, the MAX wattage of a power supply is not how much it draws. A power supply will only pull the amount you are useing. A high wattage can be more effectant as most power supplys peak at 50% load.</p>

<p>But they will use much more energy then necessary when they at less than 25% of load.</p>
