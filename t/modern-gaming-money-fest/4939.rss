    <title>Modern gaming, money fest?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/modern-gaming-money-fest/4939</link>
    <description>So i&#39;ve realised that some game companies are just spewing out games quite literally out of their arses, to name a few: Activision, THQ and EA.  :frowning: 

I&#39;ve a few problems with modern sales tactics.

Starcraft 2 being sold in 3 parts.
I&#39;m looking forward to SCII but i&#39;ve only played the first one, i don&#39;t know, 3 times? with three factions i don&#39;t know who would be more fun, so i guess i&#39;d better buy all three so i can play a deep story for each faction.

DLC.
pretty much i see it like devs couldn&#39;t be bothered to put all of the content in the same release so you have to pay about 50p for a new gun or car. What happened to patching?

Generic series.
Westwood started something awesome. Then EA came in, made it slightly better looking, kept a few things origional to each universe, then implemented 3 factions and orbital bombardment powers to each universe.
I also feel like not very many new games have brought something really original to the table, like homeworld brought spaceships into a whole 3D field (forgive me if they weren&#39;t the first to do so) and audiosurf brought putting your own music in a race track environment.

That&#39;s how I feel, or am I just being cheap? I guess I can&#39;t just find an awesome game for less then a tenner anymore.</description>

            <p>Yeah, Phantasy Star 4 for the Genesis, the original cost for the game was $100.</p>
<p>Part of me still thinks I would pay for it at that price</p>

            <p>Right. I’m not saying that games haven’t gotten blander. Perhaps they have (though there were always shitty games as well). I dislike the bloatedness of the game industry today too, but there are gems all over, you just have to know where to look. Some smaller indie games are really worth playing, and there is still a market out there for the hardcore. I just wish developers would grow more balls, and start treating games as an art form, not as the behemothic bland entertainment machine that movies have become.</p>

 Naked Shooter:</div>

<p>I’d just like to point out that gaming has never been a poor-man’s diversion. It didn’t get more expensive, if anything, it got cheaper. The NeoGeo was worth $600+ with games costing $200+. Granted, NeoGeo was notorious for being expensive, but other games were never too cheap. SNES games went up to (and probably over) $70, and some computer games before that were around $70.</p>
<p>We are probably over reacting to the $10 rise in the price of games from last gen to this one, and possibly from the PS1 generation, but gaming is by no means more expensive than it was before, especially with inflation taken into account.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Nah, gaming has simply gotten more uniform.  Before games could be really really cheap or as you said crazy expensive.  Average that out and its about the same.</p>

            <p>I’m sure that Super Metroid didn’t have a graphics development budget in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Games indeed cost a HELL of a lot more than they used to to make, but since they have a HELL of a lot bigger market, they make a HELL of a lot more revenue.  It’s also why games are getting more bland and generally more broadly inoffensive, like Garfield.  They practically all have to have relatively large production costs (though not necessarily as big as AAA titles), and company heads want to be like the others and hit that biggest market, the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Oh well, maybe we’ll have another gaming golden era, or maybe games will all just keep getting lamer until it’s all daytime TV.</p>

            <p>You seem to ignore the 3 things that I posted valve gets out of things like that.  Gabe Newell is a true gamer, he only owns and runs part of the company.  He is a co-founder.  They don’t just do things because  they love you.  They do them in that manor because they love you but not solely out of love.</p>
<p>Also, if this <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=6380" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=6380</a> ridiculous I don’t know what is.</p>

            <p>Valve honestly did not have to give away Portal for 2 friggin’ weeks.  They could have easily halved the time, or maybe limited it to only new Mac customers.  Or hell!  They could have just made it half off!  But no, they let anybody have it for free.  For all the people who were never going to buy it anyway because they didn’t want to spend any money.  I think that’s good will, since they really, truly did NOT have to do it.  In fact, they could have easily made money, but they chose to give away free content instead.</p>
<p>Remember, Valve is still run by a gamer.  I don’t think many of the other AAA-title-producing companies can say the same.</p>

That just shows that they aren’t only to make a profit (Valve didn’t HAVE to give L4D2 free and if they’re giving it away free then they’re not making a profit). Obviously they still want money but they take many years (as we all know) to make their games and polish the hell out of them until they’re insanely good.</p>

<p>I dunno, maybe it’s not so prevalent recently, but I have noticed a number of games in the past where the opposite was true: SP was well done but the MP felt unnecessary and just tacked-on as an afterthought, without much effort put into it. Either way, I am of the opinion that if you’re not going to put equal amounts of effort into both SP and MP so that they are both good, you might as well scrap the weaker and use the effort saved to make the good part better.</p>

<p>I just hate games that “force” you to work on multiplayer to get the most out of it though, especially with trophies/achievements, seriously, not everyone CAN do online multiplayer, so why force them to do so?<br>
MW2: I don’t want to pay 30 additional bucks to be able to play with 90% of the people on there</p>
<p>And yeah, Borderlands ending?  It puzzled me, I mean it seemed anti-climatic at first, but then I actually thought about WHY that’s how it turned out, and I came up with a good bit of fridge logic there.</p>

<p>One more thing that seems to have crept into gaming recently is neglecting story modes and single player for online multiplayer.<br>
I side with Yahtzee saying a game should be worth it’s money for single player alone, unless of coarse it’s a game like TF2 where all you have is online.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t say Borderlands had awesome single-player. The story wasn’t very fleshed out, the characters weren’t given any depth, and the ending was nothing short of disappointing.</p>
<p>The gameplay was still fun, it just doesn’t stand out as an awesome single-player game to me.</p>

            <p>Yeah boarderlands was awesome single player but it also kind of changed itself for multiplayer which impressed me quite a bit.<br>
it was worth £7</p>
