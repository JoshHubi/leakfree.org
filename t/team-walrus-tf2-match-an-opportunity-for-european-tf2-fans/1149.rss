    <title>Team Walrus TF2 match? An opportunity for European TF2 fans</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/team-walrus-tf2-match-an-opportunity-for-european-tf2-fans/1149</link>
    <description>Hola guys. I&#39;ll let you know via chat later in case anyone misses this, but in the mean time here&#39;s the skinny:

As some of you are already aware, I&#39;m a member of a European (mainly but not exclusively British) Team Fortress 2 clan called The Sexual Gimps, or TSG. TSG exists under the umbrella gaming community called [url=&#39;https://www.jarhedz.com/page.php&#39;]jarHedz[/url], and they host our servers (jarHedz Fun Servers 1 and 2 and the Animal Server are the ones I usually drag you guys into for a game) and forums, as well as a few other clans for other games and a general gaming community who play on the servers or post on the forums without being in a clan.

Something I&#39;ve been thinking about for a while is trying to get a bunch of the BM community who play TF2 (Team Walrus essentially but not exclusively) together for one or more friendly matches against my clan, just for a bit of semi-competitive fun. Yesterday I ran the idea by my clan leader Russ (you may have seen him in the server as [-TSG-] WildRuss [CL]) and he&#39;s on board, and I then ran the idea by Keresh as figurehead and spiritual leader of Team Walrus and he&#39;s agreed to captain a team. As for my own involvement, I&#39;ve no idea which team, if any, I would play on - either would be a bit weird and traitorous - and if need be I&#39;ll just organise and spectate. Though it would be a shame to just sit on the sidelines. Maybe I could be a floating sub, and play for either team as needed. Anyway, that&#39;s all just detail, along with time/date/format and such, that can be worked out once I hear if anyone&#39;s interested. So what do you say? If there&#39;s enough interest I&#39;ll probably 



One caveat - I&#39;m afraid our servers, as some of you are already painfully aware - are configured to kick anyone whose ping is consistently over 150 for a period of time, so that excludes anyone from far enough away or with a poor enough connection to not meet that criteria (sorry Coll). In the longer term, if we do this more than once, I might see if I can loosen that restriction for a future match of casual fun, but we&#39;ll have to see about that. If you&#39;re unsure what ping you would get on our servers (or you&#39;re curious and looking for a cool place to hang out and play TF2  :slight_smile:  /advertisment) hit me up with a PM and I&#39;ll give you the IP addresses so you can try them out.</description>

<p>Just don’t go to a server that kicks because of high ping.</p>
<p>I’ve played with Sam and others on European servers and not been kicked.</p>
<p>Just don’t choose your clans server when you play.</p>
<p>It’s not like you get brownie points for playing on it.</p>
<p>And plus it allows the extended BM fanbase to join in, it not just me but the American fellows as well.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Trying to organise any kind of even slightly competitive game on a server to which none of use has admin access is a bit of a pain, Coll. On our server we can put it into tournament mode that will make it much easier to set up and run a match, and we don’t have to worry about auto-balance making it hard to separate into teams at the beginning. We also can password it once we get everyone together so we don’t get randoms dropping in and making a mess of the whole affair. Lastly we can choose specific maps we want to play on, as in maybe one chosen by TW, one by TSG and one chosen jointly by popular vote, or something.</p>
<p>I’m not adverse to finding a European server that’s more forgiving of pings and trying to get a big Team Walrus get together there for you and other BM fans who can’t play on my clan servers, but I think that’s more easily handled as a separate affair than this friendly match, otherwise it’s just going to be a big headache. Sorry mate.</p>

<p>This isn’t ‘clanning’, it’s some people from a clan (who you play with all the time anyway) and some friends (ditto) having a laugh together. It’s not more serious than if you and your mates got together for a game of football in the park or something. But if you really can’t be swayed, then so be it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll be trying to get us together to look at availability so I can pick a time and day when as many as possible can join. Speak to you all then.</p>
