    <title>Load loop in surface tension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/load-loop-in-surface-tension/14118</link>
    <description>So recently I got to the section in surface tension with the warehouse filled with explosives. I left after a while. When I returned and used the auto save (the one where the scientist tells you to proceed with extreme caution) The explosion happens immediately, even with godmode on. I tried loading an earlier save to see if this fixes the problem, it does not. Can someone hep me please?</description>
