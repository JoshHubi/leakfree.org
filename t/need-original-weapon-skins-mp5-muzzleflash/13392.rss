    <title>Need original weapon skins + MP5 muzzleflash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-original-weapon-skins-mp5-muzzleflash/13392</link>
    <description>(Damn I hope I posted this in the right section) So, I usually make back ups for most of the games I use mods on. Not Black Mesa, though. And that was dumb of me. I know. This thread wouldn&#39;t even exist if I had been a little more careful. But yeah, as you might&#39;ve figured, I messed up some files. Yes, I would reinstall BMS but my internet has not been too kind lately, and I also have several custom files I would like to keep.

Sorry for the annoyance, but yeah, if anyone could upload the original weapon skins (and the muzzleflash for the MP5, as I got a really bland one that came with a skin), I&#39;d be very happy!

Thanks for your time, and sorry in advance.</description>
