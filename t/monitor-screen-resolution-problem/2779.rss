    <title>Monitor Screen Resolution problem.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/monitor-screen-resolution-problem/2779</link>
    <description>Er, I&#39;ve had this monitor for two years now, and I suspect that age might have SOMETHING to do with my problem, but am not yet willing to write it off as old and useless.

My monitor (a Gateway FPD1975W TFT LCD Monitor) is capable of up to 1440x900 resolution, widescreen, but I never liked that, so I always use 1400x1050.  Just a few days ago, it started cutting off the top 2 pixels on my screen, and I&#39;d have to hit the Auto-format button on the side of the monitor to fix it.  This error would recur every time I opened then closed a game or restarted my computer.
Just today (in the last hour or so), the monitor decided to be unable to rescale those missing two pixels, and is now cutting off about...  Two window-scroll-bars worth of screen.  It doesn&#39;t seem to happen on other resolutions, but...  I&#39;m used to this one, and widescreen resolutions make me want to puke, when it comes to looking at how horribly stretched fonts are.

Anybody know what might be causing this?</description>

            <p>Widescreen resolutions would make everything <span class="bbcode-i">un</span>stretched.</p>
<p>Stretching 4 : 3 to 16 : 10 does not help at all. In order for things to <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> be stretched you would have to set your GPU scaling to proportional, in which case you would have black bars on the side of your screen.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>LCD monitors cannot display MORE pixels than the native resolution. You cannot actually display 1050 horizontal lines of resolution on a monitor that has 900 horizontal lines. It’s possible that you can have the GPU software scale the image down to fit your screen, but there will be graphical issues. This will be exaggerated by the fact that that 1050 resolution isn’t even the 16:10 aspect ratio of the monitor.</p>
<p>I think it’s funny that you say the widescreen resolutions make you puke because things are stretched, when you are looking at stretching with that resolution as there is no way to fit the res. on your monitor without scaling.</p>
<p>Use the native resolution. ALWAYS. Turning off scaling will also give better performance in games.</p>

            <p>Have you tried setting the resolution with your graphics card’s control panel?</p>
<p>Could be that your monitor is about to cash in, they have a tendency to crap out after a few years. At least mine do, that is.</p>
