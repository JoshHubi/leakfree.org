    <title>Mp5 shell casings?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mp5-shell-casings/11761</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone out there has made a fix for the shells ejecting out of the mp5. They currently come out the front of the muzzle everytime you fire. Can anyone fix them so they come out of the side like they should?</description>
