    <description>Hey guys, just thought i&#39;d report a bug in my opinion.

As you can see, the pump is on yet I have the handle in my hands. All I did was push E next to it.

It was on the level [b]BLAST PIT[/b]

It wouldn&#39;t let me give my co-ords or anything.

It&#39;s not a big deal as I was just pushing buttons but y&#39;know, it&#39;s there!

Also, dont ask why I have 1hp, I haven&#39;t found a health thing in ages XD QUICK SAVE

It&#39;s just after the Big Fan when I go through the air duct, about 2 mins on from that, maybe less.

[EDIT]

I turned my head and saw a health thing! YOU GUYS DO CARE!
