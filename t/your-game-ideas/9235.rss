    <description>Yeah, I may get the &quot;this is a place to talk about the mod&quot; thing this time but hear me out.
Simply put, what game ideas have you come up with that you would like to see realized? A old-school type shooter that brings back the fast paced action of yesteryear? A more thoughtful game that deals in things more profound? Or simply a fun little thing to play on your spare time?

Well, I had an idea about a alternative history game (yes, yes I know) that takes place in 2012 in world where neither World Wars happed. Instead, Europe got stuck in the &quot;armed peace&quot; period a lot longer, resulting in vastly different world (the Russian empire hasn&#39;t fallen, Germany is still under, tanks don&#39;t exist or are nowhere near as advanced today, etc).</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I had a game idea once a while back, MMORPG. I started to work out the kinks but it started to become a bigger project than I was anticipating.<br>
Basics were you started as one of 2 classes of any race you wanted in the game. Each race had a different fighting style for both of the classes, but mathematically no race was better than any other. It was all Aesthetic.<br>
The two classes were Magic, and Melee, and as you leveled up your class could evolve in several different ways. no limit. It makes finding your own style of fighting easier and warrents playing the way you want, not cookie cutter.</p>
<p>The game plays out through quests that tell a story, each time you play the story dynamically changes along with the quest as the players evolve the world. My idea was to keep it updating all the time based on what majority of the players did. Like if they let a certain character die 70% of the time, then after a certain amount of time, (like a month) I’d remove that character from gameplay and any quest line he or she may have had in the next update would be gone for good.</p>
<p>Pvp wise there would be 6 different factions for the players to choose from. Each with their own political power, their own allies, and their own enemies, and they would fight over land to gain economic power. But the more land they grabbed the farther apart their forces spread making it easier for the other factions to push back and regrab the land lost. Making it impossible to wipe out a faction mechanic wise. Story wise each headquarters of the seperate factions are heavily guarded and hard to stamp out. You can change factions at any time through a series of quests, and once done if you want to go back to your old one or change to a different one. same quest series for a different faction. meant to be long and difficult to prevent the want to switch by those who always want to be in the strongest faction.</p>
<p>Haven’t worked out more than that, decided to take it and turn it into a story itself, which is actually getting worked out more than I ever did for the game.</p>

            <p>I want to make a Bethesda-scale open-world game based in a steampunk alpine lake setting.  In the main quest, you play the role of a law officer tracking a dangerous fugitive.  Exactly what the fugitive is on the run from, who was involved (witnesses/victims/accomplices), and what sort of trail of chaos he/she wreaks across the game world in his/her attempt to avoid capture are drawn at random at the beginning of each game from a large library of possibilities, so that the main quest is different each time you play.</p>
<p>The game world would be inhabited by its own unique menagerie of punk-fantasy themed creatures and factions, and you’d have at your disposal a combination of state-of-the-art steampunk tech and sorcery (called “worldsong,” a term borrowed from a really mediocre steampunk novel I read once).</p>

            <p>Id like to see more stylistic games, today’s art design is terribly boring. A few older games had really great innovative art, Oddworld, Medievil, SkullMonkeys.</p>
<p>Slightly less creative, but still awesome art direction, Spyro 1, Crash Bandicoot, Worms Armageddon.</p>

            <p>I’d like to see a game where EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY you kill has an effect on the story, the effects don’t have to be too huge, but it would be kind of funny if a the mother of a rat you kill in the first part of the game comes back as the final boss, and makes the game uber difficult.</p>

            <p>I always wanted to make some kind of first-person game based around the idea of super realistic and fluid character movement, as in you would move your character’s body more realistically than the normal mouse and keyboard set up allows for. I’m not sure what the actual game would really be though, but it would have lots of hand-to-hand combat like Riddick, probably.</p>

<p>Not really… If the game takes place indoors, you could save up a lot of RAM, dividing the stages a la Half-Life. The budget part I agree though. It would need a fuckload of programmers and would need about as much disk space as RAGE.<br>
Besides this sounds just like the organic shooter the genre needs. I say set it in the future so you can have some awesome weapons and can explain everything from aliens attacking to faulty AI or terrorist takeovers of the facility.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It would also be really cool if you had the option to record the events of your play-through and play as someone else during that campaign. Not reasonably possible withing the next few years, but still exhilarating to think about.</p>

            <p>I like Dr. Maxwell’s idea, it does have potential.  It would be cool if after you played a character, or after you saw a disaster, you could choose them in a NG+.  Also, if there is voice acting, don’t ask Bethesda where to get voice actors for hundreds of characters :fffuuu:</p>

 Dr. Maxwell:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Bear with me, this is going to sound like Half-Life 1 or Black Mesa at first…</p>
<p>It’s a first-person game with no cutscenes and a silent protagonist.  It starts out as a normal day in some kind of enormous mysterious facility.  Then, something goes drastically wrong, people start dying, hostile entities begin to flood in, and the whole complex falls apart.</p>
<p>The first thing that you might notice that distinguishes it from Half-Life and Black Mesa is that you’re not always being railroaded in one direction.  There are tons of different paths you can take, and they lead in different directions.  That’s not the only way you can influence the course of the story - even if you are mute, you can still communicate with the other survivors by answering questions with “yes” and “no” (by nodding or shaking your head).  Everything is incredibly detailed, and I mean even beyond Black Mesa level.  Every person in the complex has a full personality and history (and there are a lot of people in the complex), every document in the complex is readable, and every room in the complex is mapped out and could hypothetically be visited.</p>
<p>But the real magic starts when you finish, and you hit new game.</p>
<p>The facility is in working condition, again, like it was when you started it the first time.  All of the calendars indicate that it’s the same date as it was on your first playthrough.  All of that makes sense, it’s a new playthrough, so it starts at the same point in time as the first one did.  But everything isn’t quite the same.  You don’t recognize the part of the building that you’re in.  And you’re not playing as the same character, either.  Then the disaster strikes.  But it’s not the same disaster.  Maybe the first time, aliens teleported in, but this time, the central computer has gained self-awareness and doesn’t like people.  Or maybe the power went out and all of the experiments escaped.  Or maybe you were invaded by a paramilitary organization.  There are a lot of possibilities, and it varies from playthrough to playthrough.  (There are enough different disasters that it’ll take a while for them to recur, and each disaster can play out in many, many different ways.  Sometimes, one disaster will cause another one, but only if it’s a logical procession of events.)</p>
<p>Whatever the disaster is, the effects on the facility are randomly generated to suit that disaster.  The self-aware computer would tend to use the facility’s electronic systems to create hazards and barriers, for example.  What it takes multiple playthroughs to get, though, is that the only random elements are “who is the player character” and “what is the disaster and how does it effect the facility”.  The starting state of the facility is always the same, and you’ll slowly recognize this over the course of multiple playthroughs, as you visit an area you’ve seen before in a different disaster, or you meet up with a survivor who you’ve met as someone else in a different disaster.  Also, note that everything in the facility is simulated independently of the player’s presence.  When you reach an area and you see a group of survivors hiding in a little shelter that they’ve made, that’s not randomized when you got there.  That was randomized a while ago, while you were somewhere else, and the game bounced those character’s AIs off of each other (and every character has a unique AI, since every character has their own personality and history), and they decided together that it would be a good idea to hide in a shelter.</p>
<p>Every time you play, you learn a little bit more about the facility and the people in it.  It’s never explicitly mentioned, but on average, the security clearance of the character you play as increases as you play the game more and more times.  Over multiple playthroughs, you can slowly flesh out your map of the complex and your knowledge of its history and inhabitants.  The thing is, the complex is always struck by SOME kind of disaster.  At first you just take it as a given, but as time goes by, it really gives you pause to think, doesn’t it?  As you play more and more, it will slowly become apparent that there is a reason that the complex is always struck by disaster at the same time.  You can only find out why by piecing together little subtle details from different playthroughs - and maybe, just maybe, you might eventually be able to stop the cycle.</p>

            <p>Bear with me, this is going to sound like Half-Life 1 or Black Mesa at first…</p>
<p>It’s a first-person game with no cutscenes and a silent protagonist.  It starts out as a normal day in some kind of enormous mysterious facility.  Then, something goes drastically wrong, people start dying, hostile entities begin to flood in, and the whole complex falls apart.</p>
<p>The first thing that you might notice that distinguishes it from Half-Life and Black Mesa is that you’re not always being railroaded in one direction.  There are tons of different paths you can take, and they lead in different directions.  That’s not the only way you can influence the course of the story - even if you are mute, you can still communicate with the other survivors by answering questions with “yes” and “no” (by nodding or shaking your head).  Everything is incredibly detailed, and I mean even beyond Black Mesa level.  Every person in the complex has a full personality and history (and there are a lot of people in the complex), every document in the complex is readable, and every room in the complex is mapped out and could hypothetically be visited.</p>
<p>But the real magic starts when you finish, and you hit new game.</p>
<p>The facility is in working condition, again, like it was when you started it the first time.  All of the calendars indicate that it’s the same date as it was on your first playthrough.

            <p>That’s because it’s essentially a new form of storytelling that hasn’t is still on its first steps. Old games were either one extreme or the other (Doom or Monkey Island, for the sake of comparison), so developers still have problem detaching themselves from the old school or outright cinematic narrative.</p>

<p>Another idea i’ve had is an effective perma-death mmorpg. One where death set you back to a new character but wasn’t frustruating when it did so. This would make high level characters more revered, because the skill required to get there would be immense, while also allowing for more open adventuring. But the whole perma death would be tough to master, and even then would only appeal to a select audience.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like this. You could make it that, instead of leveling up, you could build up connections between NPC and PC alike. Kind of a social ladder mechanic maybe? This means you still have pretty much any skill avaible to your class, but the concentrates on moving stuff behind the conflicts of the world. Eventually you could build an army of NPC’s and PC’s and lead land grabs maybe?</p>

            <p>To be honest, I feel like most of today’s young game designers are running into issues when the first thing they think of for their game is the storyline, basically ignoring how it plays. Most effective game design discussions move the opposite way, with story being fairly modular. I think Final Fantasy 7 was at one point some sort of Noir murder mystery game in Midgar.</p>

            <p>I have an idea for a first person shooter roguelike crossed with Zelda.</p>
<p>The player dungeon-crawls in 4 Zelda-like dungeons and utilizes the guns they find within each dungeon to advance puzzles later on in the dungeon and the game.</p>
<p>The story itself is intentionally silly and simplistic. To cut it short, the apocalypse has happened 2 times, and the second resulted in reality itself being shaken up. There existed a former order of Technomages called the Technolords, who lived to use their technomagic to keep the weaves or reality held together.</p>
<p>However, one of these technolords went rogue many years ago and killed the rest. Now, the purpose of the Technolord is a sort of gauntlet challenge. If someone manages to kill the current Technolord, they take his or her place and rule over Earth with an iron fist.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. Your job is to technologically kill the existing technolord and rule Earth.</p>
<p>I’m actively developing it; its working title is Technoquest, and it’s going to be made in a heavily modified Doom engine - you’ll be able to play without Doom, though. However, it has yet to get passed the asset gathering, art drawing, and concept phase, and I’m mostly working off of Doom 2 at the moment. No real gameplay or anything exists yet, though I have a very solid document outlining all the gameplay concepts. It’s not the most complicated game in the world.</p>
<p>(techno)</p>
