    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-would-you-release-black-mesa/4056</link>
    <description>Change the &quot;Black Mesa is some hot shit&quot; thing on the page?  Add a trailer?  Just tell the forum members and see what the hell happens?

Realistic or ridiculous, how would YOU announce the release of this baby?</description>

            <p>i would openly release a fake terrible version of it to the peoples of the interwebs and hide the actual games downloads, in parts, in the coding of various websites most of which are in different languages and arent popular at all but leave one very important file out of the parts which would make the game crash on startup and 5 months after somebody figures all of that out i would upload the missing file for everyone but put a password on the .rar with no way of finding out what it is so people would sit at their computers all day trying to crack the code and once somebody figures it out i would release the same file with no password</p>

            <p>Ahaha, I had a dream last night in which BMS was finally released.<br>
My thoughts were “Ram had to release it because otherwise he was going to have to pay someone $50”<br>
The front page of the site contained a giant flash animation with fireworks and BMS IS RELEASED flashing up.</p>
<p>I’ve been remembering lots of dreams the past few nights.  It’s a bit freaky.<br>
Another dream last night consisted of an ancient tribe of amazonian warriors who were now living in a giant cinema.  The cinema had rivers in it.  Then I got a blowjob from a girl I haven’t seen in about 5 years.  Much cooler than real life.  Except when the tribe turned out the be cannibals and tried to kill me.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure if BMS was released before or after the tribe tried to kill me.  But I’m hoping that this isn’t prophetic in any way.</p>
