    <title>Other mods to recreate HL1?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/other-mods-to-recreate-hl1/1618</link>
    <description>As I&#39;m sure we&#39;re all very excited, I think it would wet our appetites a bit to pass around other similar mods that we can play until BM is released.
The closest thing I found was [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/provenance&#39;]Provenance[/url]. I&#39;ve only played about 30 seconds into it, but so far it sucks.
What do you guys have?

Edit: apparently there was some hoax called [url=&#39;https://bit.ly/1WFLUx&#39;]BubbleHL[/url]... interesting stuff I&#39;m finding.</description>

            <p>I always died when the Strider used its warp cannon. When I later retried it, I survived for some reason (without shooting at the damned thing), but then kept dying when the tram started to raise. The mod’s not perfect, but still one of the good ones  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>I got stuck at the Strider part of Provenance first. But found out you had to shoot at it’s legs. This didn’t break the legs off or anything but somehow stalled the strider from launching it’s super attack which will kill you instantly. Also I think I reloaded this part so many times that it might have been the Strider logic that finally glitched out so I could escape it.</p>
<p>That part of the game really needs adjustment. It is a gamebreaker.</p>

</aside>
<p>So THAT’S how I do it. I’ve only been able to make it to the part where the tram begins to ascend by randomly reloading and getting a glitchy strider, but maybe now I can go back and actually finish it. There definitly needs to be something there that more clearly tells you to shoot the legs, since most people will automatically assume to shoot for a strider’s head.</p>

            <p>I just played this and I didn’t get any lag at all except for the giant explosion part in the tunnel. Other than that, it ran fine. I enjoyed it a lot. Interesting puzzles, interesting story telling, I like it a lot. It’s got me pumped for bms and the rest of the episodes. :^D</p>

            <p>Why look for another mod that recreates Half Life? There are plenty of mods and just because one recreates half life doesn’t make it any more fun than any other mod.</p>

            <p>I don’t know any that are trying to recreate HL1… Sorry. I know some that have their own story line… =)</p>
<p>Also if you play 30 seconds into a game/mod you won’t get the good stuff.</p>
<p>Even HL in the first 30sec was boring as fuck because I had to listen to the annoying intercom.</p>
<p>Did that stop me? Nooooope. =D</p>
