    <title>Fixing Issues with Latest Patch (Content Update 0.1.0)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixing-issues-with-latest-patch-content-update-0-1-0/14213</link>
    <description>As you may or may not be aware, we just released our first big content update! You can [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28318-Content-Update-0-1-0/&#39;]view the details here[/url].

If you are having strange issues with the latest content update, it is most likely to do with using old save games from before the update. Unfortunately, Source and old save games do not seem to handle updates very well.

It appears the issues do not happen if you start a new game. If you are experiencing weird bugs (such as having zombie hands in SP, health chargers not working, sprint being stuck on), try starting a new game from whatever chapter you were on. You will lose your progress in the chapter, but the bugs will be resolved.

You may still find sprint is stuck permanently on. If that is the case, you just need to untick &quot;always run&quot; in the Black Mesa tab of the options menu.

We apologise for the inconvenience, but the way Source handles saves with updates is unfortunately something we have very little control over.

Thanks for playing, we hope that aside form this minor blip that you guys love the patch!</description>
