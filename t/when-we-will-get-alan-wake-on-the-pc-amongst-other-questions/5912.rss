    <title>When we will get Alan Wake on the PC? (amongst other questions)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/when-we-will-get-alan-wake-on-the-pc-amongst-other-questions/5912</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m considering investing some money in my favourite hobby. I could go for a new CPU for my pc, a quad core for example, that would require me to get ddr3 ram and a new mother board. I mainly want to do this because some games are starting to lag on me (specially BFBC2 on multiplayer with more than 15 players on the server). These are my specs:

[u]CPU[/u]: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3600+
[u]Memory[/u]: 4096MB ddr2
[u]Motherboard[/u]: Asus m2n-sli
[u]HD[/u]: 483 GB Total
[u]Video Card[/u]: NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GSO
[u]Operating System[/u]: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit

OR
I could finally get a console for the exclusives. In this case I can&#39;t decide between the PS3 and the 360. So, finally the reason for the title. Now that Microsoft seems to want to take back the pc market and start releasing some games here. Do you think they will release Alan Wake on the PC?.
It&#39;s very important for me because, if M$ ever releases this game on the pc  AND I decide to get a console, I will get a PS3. I&#39;ve waited to be able to play this game for a long time and still am very hyped about it as I love good stories, specially ones about mystery.

PS: Any thoughts on what should I get for my pc, if I decide not to turn to the dark side and to stay with the pc master race, based on my gaming ring?</description>

<p>There’s nothing to worry about in the way of the PS3’s popularity waning. Sales are above the 360 in Asia and Europe, and while they’re less in the US, they’re nothing to scoff at.</p>
<p>Actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_exclusives#Microsoft_Xbox_360" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">I think you’ll find</a> that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_exclusives#Sony_PlayStation_3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">PS3 has far more in the way of exclusives than the 360 does</a>. Beyond the big ones like Halo, Gears of War and the titular Alan Wake, there’s not that many I can put my finger on. And most of those games are pretty tired as it is. Project Gotham Racing? Except the PS3 just got GT 5 and has enough racing games to drown any other console. Viva Pinata maybe?</p>
<p>On the other hand the PS3 has epic titles like Uncharted, God of War, Metal Gear Solid, the aforementioned GT, Final Fantasy, Heavy Rain, inFamous, Killzone, LittleBigPlanet, Resistance, Singstar, Time Crisis (epic with a Move) and Ratchet &amp; Clank, to name a few.</p>
<p>Obviously, however, this comes down to choice. If you hate hack-n-slashes, dislike stories and never play racing games, then the advantages of the PS3 diminish exponentially. If you are a Halo lover and simply <span class="bbcode-i">must</span> experience those precious few months of Halo Wars before the leaderboards go offline, then a 360 would be infinitely more appropriate.</p>
<p>Right, well, let’s break this down a bit. Firstly, ‘social gaming’ most often takes place on your own console, so the fact that other people own it is a tad irrelevant. What’s more important is that you have more controllers, and that’s a moot point when comparing the 360 to the PS3. Secondly, while more people having 360’s may be <span class="bbcode-i">your</span> experience Garth, I seriously doubt its universal. Aside from Wiis, none of my friends have 360’s, and my girlfriend and a few other friends have PS3’s. So your milage may vary; see what your friends have got, but generalisations are a big nono here.</p>
<p>One important note for ‘sociability’ is that the 360 will make you pay a yearly subscription to play <span class="bbcode-i">any</span> game online, whereas the PS3 lets you go right from the start.</p>
<p>zou do know they got rid of the boomerang, right? They’re exactly the same as the PS2, but just wireless. If you experience discomfort while playing, I’d contend that you must have unusually shaped hands.</p>
<p>And you’re advocating for him to get an Xbox…why?</p>
<p>A further question I think you should consider is whether or not you want to invest in either of the new motion controllers and, if so, which one you wanted to go for. From what I can see, the Move has more potential for actual playability, whereas the Kinect wins hands down at being the pinnacle of gimmicks, though both are still fairly early on in their circulation, and we haven’t seen what they can really do beyond the release titles.</p>
<p>Finally, the PS3 is a BluRay player. If you haven’t got one of these yet, then the PS3 would serve this purpose perfectly.</p>

<p>Well, it looks like I was severely mistaken. I’ll stick to pcs then and stop butting in in console vs. console arguments. :retard:</p>

            <p>I’ve been in a lecture by the art director of remedy. He answered to the question of Xbox exclusivity by saying that they couldn’t release it on the PS3 because microsoft was publishing it, and didn’t release it on the PC because piracy would affect their sales negatively. He thought that if the game was available on the PC, it would even lessen the xbox sales, so they just dropped the whole PC version.</p>

<p>I even remember them saying that Alan Wake would really squeeze the potential of quad-core processors…</p>
<p>Seeing I own an HDTV but no bluray player (so far I hooked my PC to the tv in order to watch tv shows such as Lost and Fringe on HD) and I’ve several friends that own a PS3, I think that if I go for a console I will choose the PS3. Still, I’m seriously considering sticking with the pc master race, overall it is cheaper if you are smart and patient. In addition to this I’ve been a pc gamer since I was really young. I think that I will wait some more before I buy anything. I’m a pc gamer, I’m a patient gamer.</p>

            <p>I say get a 360 if you’re going to get a console. PS3 popularity is slipping and it really doesn’t have much in the way of exclusives. Most importantly, the only big advantage consoles have over pcs is social gaming, and, at least in  my experience, most people have xboxs. What’s the point of buying something for social gaming if no one else has it to socialize with? Also ps3 controllers are uncomfortable.</p>
<p>As for M$ wanting a bigger presence in pc gaming, sauce plz? I’ve been screwed over by M$ too many times to expect anything from them.</p>

<p>I know and I thank you for that. Sorry if I came out as angry or anything. I’m not an English native speaker but I do my best (btw, please, point out any grammar mistakes as it may help me improving).</p>
<p>The main reason why I’m asking this is because I was wondering what will M$ do now with the PC. Apparently they want to have a larger presence here, but we don’t know whether that presence would mean they will start releasing casual games (such as that new AOE and the new flight “simulator”) or give us ports of their main games from the 360 (such as halo, fable, Alan Wake, gears of wars, etc).</p>

<p>That is why I was asking about Alan Wake being released on pc, so far it’s an xbox 360 exclusive.</p>

            <p>Yeah, don’t decide between the two consoles. I can’t remember what it was, but a game I really wanted was on a PS3, and I had a Xbox 360…and other times, friends have had to come over to my house because I had an exclusive 360 game… it gets to be a Find a friend with the other console and get buddies QUICK.</p>
<p>Sorry, I have no ideas on what PC to get. I get people to help me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>It has a simultaneous release with Black Mesa.</p>
<p>As for what console to choose… Never ask that question. No matter what you chose you’ll end up envying the other side for it’s exclusives.</p>

            <p>I suppose Microsoft will port over a few of their exclusives, probably Alan Wake as they aren’t clinging on to it as a cashcow at the moment.   As for what  to get for your pc, I reccomend a Dx11 enabled card, I would reccomend the 5670 from my personal experience as it has greatly enhanced my performance. Though the 5870 would be a more reccomended purchase.</p>

            <p>Well, I’m considering investing some money in my favourite hobby. I could go for a new CPU for my pc, a quad core for example, that would require me to get ddr3 ram and a new mother board. I mainly want to do this because some games are starting to lag on me (specially BFBC2 on multiplayer with more than 15 players on the server). These are my specs:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">CPU</span>: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3600+<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Memory</span>: 4096MB ddr2<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Motherboard</span>: Asus m2n-sli<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">HD</span>: 483 GB Total<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Video Card</span>: NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GSO<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Operating System</span>: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit</p>
<p>OR<br>
I could finally get a console for the exclusives. In this case I can’t decide between the PS3 and the 360. So, finally the reason for the title. Now that Microsoft seems to want to take back the pc market and start releasing some games here. Do you think they will release Alan Wake on the PC?.<br>
It’s very important for me because, if M$ ever releases this game on the pc  AND I decide to get a console, I will get a PS3. I’ve waited to be able to play this game for a long time and still am very hyped about it as I love good stories, specially ones about mystery.</p>
<p>PS: Any thoughts on what should I get for my pc, if I decide not to turn to the dark side and to stay with the pc master race, based on my gaming ring?</p>
