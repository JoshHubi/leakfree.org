    <description>Hey there all!

I&#39;ve designed a Portal 2 singleplayer map. This map is a two-room chamber map that focuses on making use of [i]both[/i] rooms to solve the puzzle. Many areas are recycled throughout the course of the level. Repulsion gel and propulsion gel sees use in this level.

The map can be found here: [url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=467846609[/url]

I have had this map floating around in my head for around two years. Once upon a time I even tried to realize it but didn&#39;t get very far (I had a functioning puzzle but the asthetic didn&#39;t gel), and I lost that version a long time ago. I sat down a few days ago and decided to give it another try. I am immensely satisfied with the results. This is my first attempt at the Old Aperture theme and I think it turned out really well.

Comments and criticisms welcome!</description>

<p>Because I was fixing the map. It’s up now.</p>
<p>I added a small fizzler portion that should put the exploit to rest for good. At least, nothing short of speedrunning tactics I think.</p>

            <p>…Yeah, that’s very not supposed to happen, since if you did that you skipped 5/6 of the entire puzzle. Since you mentioned it, I was able to replicate it. Going to patch that.</p>

            <p>In the spoilers, possible bug, unsure if intended:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>I was able to complete the challenge without using the propulsion gel.  I coated the area with the repulsion gel spigot with the blue stuff, bounced around, grabbed the cube, and used the elevated platform to gain the needed height to get the cube up to the button.  Put the cube on the button and walk through the door to the elevator/exit.</p>
</div>
<p>Was I supposed to do it that way?</p>

            <p>It usually takes me about three minutes to run the course. I expect it’ll take more for everyone else only because I know the map (and its solution) like the back of my hand. I would estimate a 7 minute game.</p>

<p>Man, I wanna give it a shot, but I don’t have P2 installed. How long do you expect the chamber to take to play?</p>
