    <description>Yup, seems the camera has shifted to an unattractive view for this particular loading screen.

I don&#39;t have to do anything to reproduce this, happens consistently every load for me, not sure what caused it initially though.

Edit: Well go figure, forgot I had the experimental coop commands still in my startup options (not sure what sv_cheats/deathmatch/and sv_lan could do to cause this) but none the less, i removed the startup options and the menu is fine.</description>

            <p>Good to hear you had resolved this one. It’d be cool if you spend some time investigating what was the command that had been causing this problem. It’s not that important but rather I’m simply curious about this :-).</p>
