    <title>Crash in Antimass-Spectrometer Room</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-in-antimass-spectrometer-room/12891</link>
    <description>I was simply enjoying this awesome game :3 , when I went into the Antimass Spectrometer room to progress through the storyline as normal. I activated the machine, and went down the ladder. I was waiting for the machine to fully turn on, so I started to screw around to kill time. :retard: By the door, there is a white power box, and I jumped on top of it to see if I could climb into parts of the room that would be normally inaccessible (I tend to do that a lot). Then the game crashed. Not sure why, either.  :frowning: 

Sadly there is no MDMP file for this crash. :meh:
