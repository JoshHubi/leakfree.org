I know I&#39;ve been spamming the chat with this a lot in the past week, so now I&#39;ll give you guys a break and spam this thread instead. [/SIZE]

It&#39;s a little project I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot in the last months, and I thought I could share it to you guys. Basically I want to set up a weekly radio show broadcasting electro, house and trance over the wonders that are called Interwebs.

How is it better than other shows like this? Well I don&#39;t only stick to one genre. A lot of show only play Trance or House music. It&#39;s good, but I think sometimes a little variety doesn&#39;t hurt. I&#39;ve also seen a lot of shows that are only broadcasting (bad)[/SIZE]remixes of Pop songs. Yeah they can also sound right, but I don&#39;t think the word &quot;remix&quot; means &quot;adding a few lines of singing. Yes I&#39;m looking at you MIMS and your Calabria remix.

It is also the opportunity for you guys who are producing music to get your songs on air. I know there are quite a few peeps on this board who are making music, and most of the time it sounds quite good! So if you want one of your songs to be put in, just say it!

Now, I havn&#39;t started to do real episodes yet, &#39;cause I&#39;m still thinking about how the show would go. So far I only did two demos, and here they are.

[b]DEMO ONE.[/b]

[url]https://www.mediafire.com/download.php?lmt2kh3onfm[/url]
[url]https://www.megaupload.com/?d=XLYDJCLO[/url]
[url]https://rapidshare.com/files/272396682/demoonepointfive.mp3[/url]

[b]Tracklist:[/b]

Moan [Trentemøller Remix] - Trentemøller
Castle Rising - Nathan Fake
The Drive - Florian Kruse
Electric Feel [Justice Remix] - MGMT
Lunar Flare - Collision Radio
Dare [DFA Remix] - Gorillaz
Music Sounds Better With You [Bibi &amp; Dimitri Remix from Paris] - Stardust

It&#39;s my first demo, and I am quite happy with it. Yes, Collision Radio is Coll from the boards.

[b]DEMO TWO[/b]

[url]https://www.mediafire.com/download.php?mwnmukzyn3r[/url]
[url]https://www.megaupload.com/?d=IDZ5T0V5[/url]

[b]Tracklist:[/b]

Crazy Penis - Starwar
Justice - Tthhee Ppaarrttyy
Sia - Buttons [Markus Schultz Vocal Remix]
The Knife - We Share Our Mothers&#39; Health [Trentemoller Remix]
Matt Zo - The Fractal Universe
Eric Prydz - Call On Me [Henrik B Remix]
Paul Van Dyk feat. John McDaid - Home [Cosmic Gate Remix]
Daft Punk - Around The World

I&#39;m not quite happy with how it turned out. I think I tried to fit in too many genres and the result if very unsatisfying.

I am currently gathering songs for the third and final demo. It should be what the episodes will sound like. Right now everything is done in Audacity, &#39;cause I don&#39;t know how to use anything else. Coll recommended me to use Acid but I don&#39;t get a thing to it. Also, since my funds are very limited, I am forced to pirate a lot of stuff. Of course what I can&#39;t pirate I buy it from Beatport.

So, how do you think it sounds? What should I improve? Discuss!</description>

            <p>Well, I’m a simple person from simple times, and all you young’uns with your electric music shit get me confused, but that is a mighty fine wall of words you got yourself there, and that means it must be a good idea.</p>
