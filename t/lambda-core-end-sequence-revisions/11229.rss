    <title>Lambda core end sequence revisions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lambda-core-end-sequence-revisions/11229</link>
    <description>There is a couple of problems with the lambda core teleportation room that I have noticed.

The scientist that starts the machine going can be killed and this stops the sequence he is currently set to not be critical to mission to keep alive. Try it out if you like for a laugh but he needs to be made critical to the mission.

Acording to the commentry where it is said the devs planned to have an alien controller attack him this might be a nice update that you have to save him before loads start spawning in after he says we have a breach. This would be a nice introduction to the new enemy Then on death of the said controller this would spawn more controllers in to the area and make him even more mission critical

Although it sounds great in the teleportation chamber the sfx volume of the teleport sequence is just a bit too loud of the machine whilst not wanting to lose the imapct that it has it needs to be lowered just a bit...

Other than this the whole sequence is Briliiant but this is not really a bug fix more a tweak to the overall way it works.</description>

            <p>Oh yes he does… Depending on what you kill him with he drops everything as he flies off of the gantry  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Another point to note at the top of the teleport platform puzzle I kept getting stuck in the ceiling in the room with all the moving platforms… I wondered if it’s worth just making a slightly higher ceiling or not making the metal grate platform ring raise quite so high as on this platform is where it was happening everything else seemed fine</p>

            <p>I originally nailed him with the crossbow to demonstrate to my brother that killing mission-critical allies will end the game.</p>
<p>To my surprise, it didn’t… And I was thoroughly confused.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>yeah agreed maxwell but I probably was not clear enough you can shoot the scientist before he gets into the control booth and stop the sequence from starting all together and then you are just trapped in the room.</p>
<p>He needs to have a critical to mission that it’s game over if you kill him like some other scientists or npc’s in the game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>But like you say it’s also game over if somthing else kills him… No AI Relationship but like the scripted seuence they had in mind… Re-enforce that critical point a bit more perhaps</p>
<p>As it is now if he dies you are just trapped in the room with no teleport sequence  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I know your not meant to kill him but if you do then…</p>

            <p>As is, you can essentially exploit through the level by running in circles until the teleporter has charged, dodging the alien controller attacks.  So, yeah, there definitely has to be some kind of “defend the scientist” angle to force the player to kill the controllers.</p>
