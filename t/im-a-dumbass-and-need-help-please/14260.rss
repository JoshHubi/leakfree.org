    <title>I&#39;m a dumbass and need help please</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/im-a-dumbass-and-need-help-please/14260</link>
    <description>I have a really quick question that I know will be dumb. But my stupid ass can&#39;t figure it out... how do I submit content to the Steam Workshop?  I&#39;ve never had any interest in submitting my own content before. So that&#39;s why I don&#39;t know. Please forgive my stupidity.

P.S If it&#39;s done through hammer, that would explain why I don&#39;t know. The modifications I&#39;ve made are all retrofitting (combining the old with the new) the modern BM sounds.</description>
