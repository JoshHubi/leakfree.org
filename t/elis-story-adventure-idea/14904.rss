    <title>Eli&#39;s story/adventure idea</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/elis-story-adventure-idea/14904</link>
    <description>Now we all know the story of Eli Vance from Half Life and Half-Life 2. The only missing equations from the story is what happened at Black Mesa and what happened after that until Half-Life 2. Well the things we know that happened after he escaped Black Mesa was that his wife died during the disaster and he was only able to save the family photo and his daughter Alyx. And obviously later he became the leader of the rebellion group against the combine and he dies later in episode 2 (spoilers for those who don&#39;t know yet). Any way&#39;s, my real question is how did Eli escape the facility in the place that he was in? Him and Kleiner were the only two (and possibly Lamar) who were in that room. I was wondering after the full completion of Black Mesa, should there be a chapter about Eli Vance&#39;s escape to freedom with Kleiner and Alyx as an infant? It&#39;s just an idea and I don&#39;t currently have any idea of how the story would/should go but I think it&#39;s a very interesting topic to think about. Tell me what you guys think and get back to me.</description>

            <p>I’ve had this idea for a while, really would be interested in getting a team together for this, as I think there’s a lot of potential… only if it’s done correctly, with talented choreos for the Kleiner scripted sequences (if the character plays as Eli), and good voice acting.</p>

            <p>Okay, so I was looking around and I saw that there was the room just above Eli and Kleiner.<br>
[attach=5004,none,1920][/attach]</p>
<p>Another View of the area and I noticed the catwalk<br>
[attach=5005,none,1920][/attach]</p>
<p>Then I noticed this gas leak and my ideas are rolling in…<br>
[attach=5006,none,1920][/attach]</p>
<p>So I’ll let you guys think of what to make of these before I add more pics<br>

<p>Dude, I am so on board with this idea, provided it continues the survival horror of Unforeseen Consequences.  After all, you are two scientists with no HEV-suits.</p>
<p>I would expect that Eli and Kleiner, after getting their act together, proceed through some of Unforeseen Consequences until they at some point branch off and go through one of the locked or blocked doors (They will have to, as Gordon fell down an elevator shaft when going to Sector B). It’s a mapper’s free for all from there, really.</p>
<p>Consider this:  Eli reveals in Episode 2 that it was The G-Man who saved Alyx:</p>

<p>Living spaces are an ideal horror environment, especially those with children (Dead Space 2, anyone?) So Eli would want to go to the dormitories to retrieve Alyx first, but maybe he wouldn’t find her there. Would he find Azian, dead, undead or alive? Her necklace would have to find it’s way to Alyx somehow. Perhaps Azian gave it to Alyx as she died? How old is Alyx even at this point??</p>

<p>Thanks for the support of the idea. It was something I was thinking of while I was away. I’m no whiz in game design but I do think it would be cool to see something like that play out. Of course, we’d need at least a story or something written first before even considering making a game.</p>
