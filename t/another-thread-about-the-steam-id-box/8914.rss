    <title>Another thread about the Steam ID box</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/another-thread-about-the-steam-id-box/8914</link>
    <description>It&#39;s stopped working for me...again.

It&#39;s been awhile since I was last here, so I dunno when it broke. Anyone know how to fix it?

Steam community ID number gives: Invalid community data.
STEAM_ ID gives: Invalid community data. (I know it&#39;s not calibrated for that, but I thought I&#39;d give it a try)
I&#39;ve no idea how to fetch the Steam-ID Number.
Custom URL gives the right account name, but wrong avatar (one I haven&#39;t used in ages) and incorrectly states that I was online near 2-3 hours ago. I&#39;m sat idling in Steam as I type this.

Or is this one of those problems that just randomly fixes itself over time? Either way, it would be nice to have my little account thingy back again.  :frowning: 

EDIT: Using Chrome, if that helps. Version 19.0.1084.56 m.</description>

</aside>
<p>It’s what it says for me as well, which is wrong because I’ve been a member on Steam for a number of years now.</p>
<p>This is all so confusing.</p>

            <p>Is it wrong to bump a thread 3 months old if you’re still having the same issue? No matter, it’s done.</p>
<p>Disregard OP. Problem is now: Community URL links right profile, but states I’m offline when I’m on.<br>
STEAM_ID doesn’t work.<br>
Other ID number doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Help a fellow scientist out?</p>
