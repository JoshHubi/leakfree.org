    <title>Half-Life &quot;Xeno Force Green Shift&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-xeno-force-green-shift/4005</link>
    <description>Was there ever an attempt to make a mod-expansion a la Blue Shift/OpFor/Decay where you play as a Vortigaunt? Because, that would be epic.

I seem to remember hearing something about it awhile ago, but this is the first time I&#39;ve thought about it in ages, so it might&#39;ve been a daydream. It may have been that little project for HL2 but I&#39;m thinking HL1. 

If it hasn&#39;t been done, how cool would that be huh!??! Of course you really wouldn&#39;t get any weapons except for like, Lighting Attack and clawing stuff. 

Think of it. For starters, you could be minding your own business on Xen being a good little slave when suddenly you&#39;re happened upon by a team of Hazard Suit-wearing scientists who zap you with something and you black out. You wake up in a daze inside a glass observation chamber and get flashes of being experimented upon. Then the resonance cascade happens and you find your chance to escape, and battle your way through Black Mesa fighting Security Guards, HECU Marines and dining on the odd scientist. To lend some imperative, perhaps the Black Mesa scientists managed to remove your slave collar, freeing you from the Nihilanth but at the same time robbing you of any save-haven -- you&#39;d surely be re-enslaved or killed should you return to Xen, while the prospect of escaping to live in the human-infested Earth is equally unappetizing. But hey, you&#39;re a Vortigaunt and you shoot green lightning and have a giant red eye, there&#39;s no limit to what you can do!

A problem is the lack of weaponry. We of course never get to see Vortigaunts with anything other than Lightning and claw attacks -- but then again we never see Security Guards with anything other than a pistol or scientists with anything period, so maybe some exceptions can be made -- such as Snarks and Hivehands and perhaps some sort of alien grenade for explosive effect -- as well as perhaps a retcon of the HL2e2 &quot;area of effect&quot; attack Vortigaunts can suddenly and inexplicably do. 

But yeah, running through BM nibbling on scientists and frying Marines with green lightning sounds pretty appealing and I&#39;m disappointed I can&#39;t find anything on a mod -- I would&#39;ve thought something like this would be a sure thing.</description>

            <p>It had great level design, and the dual hivehands and stukas were a lot of fun, but I agree that the lightning could have been a lot better.</p>

            <p>Yes there is a hl1 mod with the content you described.</p>
<p>e: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q95p8pQwA5U&amp;feature=related" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q95p8pQwA5U&amp;feature=related</a><br>
it’s called point of view<br>
edt 2: btw it’s a long time ago that i played this but i can still remember that it was becoming very annoying that you only have the ability to shoot a green lightning all 5 seconds or so and the use of the claws. becomings boring fast and in the end you’ll just play it to the end because you want to get done with it ^^</p>
