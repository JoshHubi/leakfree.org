    <title>Can&#39;t watch videos on Discovery.com</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-watch-videos-on-discovery-com/1629</link>
    <description>Never had this problem on any other site before... but when I watch any video on Discovery.com, for example:
[url]https://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-duct-tape/?smid=FBMBU-FWP-PLP[/url]
I only get the audio. I see the cursor move and everything, but no image. I have Flash Player 10. I have the K-Lite codec pack with a bunch of codecs too.
Their site doesn&#39;t seem to have any help section for these things, and google didn&#39;t help me much either...
Tried with both Chrome and IE browsers.

Any ideas on what would be different on their site than on, say, youtube?</description>

            <p>Works for me on both Firefox and Chrome.<br>
Try <a href="https://www.free-codecs.com/download/Codec_Pack_All_In_1.htm" data-bbcode="true">these</a> codecs.</p>
