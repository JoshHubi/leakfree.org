    <title>The Lambda Core - most mysterious place in the game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-lambda-core-most-mysterious-place-in-the-game/608</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

im new to this forum and want to share some of my thoughts about the first [b][i]HALF LIFE[/i][/b] and its most mysterious chapter! 
The [i]Lambda Core[/i] chapter is the one i was always mysteriously drawn to the most. Maybe it is the environment of this place, the ambient music at the beginning of the chapter when you enter the lift down to the reactor complex, or just the design of the level! Although every other chapter of HALF LIFE has its own mystery and spookiness, the LAMBDA CORE was always kind of special in my mind. 

Does anyone else share the same thoughts about this one?......
BTW, i cant wait to walk through this chapter in the [i][b]BLACK MESA [/b][/i]mod:

</aside>
<p>I actually share your idea. For some reason, I have always been drawn to the Lambda Complex, as well. That’s why I made a Half-Life Mod that was based in it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I don’t know what it is about the Lambda Complex that I liked so much. I really liked the colored walls with the levels A-D, and I wished that they would have expanded on the Lambda Complex to add more areas with those colored walls. For some reason, the colored walls attracted me to want to play that chapter more. Also, the entire feel of the Lambda Complex is high-tech. From the floor textures and ceiling textures, to the special doors and cool teleportation chambers - it was just a really neat area of Black Mesa (my favorite area, by the way). The Lambda Reactor Core was also very cool, and the teleportation was neat, as well. The texturing in the Lambda Complex was the most attractive thing about it.</p>
<p>I’m glad to see that someone else shares my opinion about the Lambda Complex. I just wish more Half-Life Mods would be made to showcase more of that complex.</p>

            <p>Lambda Core, Office Complex, and Questionable Ethics were my favorites. I took a long time on Lambda Core because I started it with 17 Health and 3 suit :fffuuu: Still fun though, I never knew how much the “Run” aspect of the game was important until my Hard difficulty go on L.C.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>(All you do is jump in a portal that brings you to the next level at the the right time and repeat. If it helps, the portals to jump in are 2, 4, and 7. the seventh portal being the one that teleports the player to the top.)</p>

            <p>I liked the Test Chamber . It realy gave me the feel of being in a high technological facility based on learning on what everything is made of and things like that. Don’t get me wrong, the Lambda Core was a interesting part of the game, but if you didn’t know where the hell you were going, than it was just a process of trial and error(which takes a very long time).</p>

<p>Does anyone know when the game will be released?</p>

<p>Have you ever remade something that looked better than the original? Have you ever made a mod. Now combine those two, and what does that give you, A LOOOOOOOOOOONG time span. I am just as anxious as the next guy about BM’s release, but seriously you don’t have to complain about it.:meh:</p>

            <p>I wasn’t that keen on Lambda Core, due to the lack of soldier enemies, and the teleport portal puzzle. But I did enjoy the first part where you go down the big lift, and fight the assassins. It was nice getting the gluon gun. And I thought turning on the reactor coolant system was cool. I thought that asthetically the reactor and teleporters looked good, and I liked the colour-coded walls and stuff. I liked the G-Man sighting as well.</p>
<p>Hard to say my favourite chapter. When I first played it was Questionable Ethics, I loved being in this lab where they studied the aliens. And you got to fight soldiers and had first encounter with alien grunts. Also loved the puzzle with bouncing the lasers, and it was great getting the tau cannon. I’m less keen on that chapter now though, because I now realise how absurd the layout of those labs is, they aren’t convincing labs at all.</p>
<p>You’ve got to walk THROUGH a dangerous biological lab to get to another dangerous biological lab? So if the doors are sealed at the first one everyone in the second one is trapped too? And upstairs is a crazy laser/weapons lab, in the same building as a biological lab, and there isn’t even a set of doors seperating upstairs from downstairs… downstairs you’ve got containers full of headcrabs, with no door seperating that area from the laser lab upstairs. Crazy!</p>
<p>I enjoyed Office Complex, and I think I still do.</p>
<p>My favourite now is probably Surface Tension. You get to fight outdoors in the sun, the enemies are mostly military, there’s stuff like helicopters and tanks.</p>
