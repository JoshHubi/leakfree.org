    <description>After playing Black Mesa through I can&#39;t even express with words how unbeliveably good this game was.. 
Pure and utter [b]genius[/b]! 

The voice acting was superb. 
The music was giving me chills, and the sound effects were earthshattering.

Though the best, I have to say, was how astonishingly accuratetly you captured the Half-Life atmosphere and aesthetics.
Ontop of that, the graphics were [b]stunning[/b] for being source..

You blew my expectations away! [i]like HL could get any better?![/i]

It has been my complete privilege to play your amazing, [b][u]AMAZING[/u][/b] game!</description>

            <p>Most of the parts they removed/replaced I didn’t like very much anyway. I especially like what they did with Questionable Ethics. That one earned it’s title. And the resonance cascade was so intense. The sound effects, the particle effects, the voices, everything was amazing, by that point I was already very into everything and caught between fear and joy.</p>

            <p>I loved the desert part when you walk on the side of the cliff with rocks tumbling down. I was almost sure that wooden bridge would have a loose plank that would fall off when I stepped on it but it didn’t.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Playing that part in 3d was kind of scary.</p>

            <p>I had really high hopes for this mod and I have not been disappointed in any way. Black Mesa is extremley well executed and I love all the links to Half-Life 2. It just makes the whole story a lot more cohesive.</p>
