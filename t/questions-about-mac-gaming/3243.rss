    <title>Questions about Mac gaming!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/questions-about-mac-gaming/3243</link>
    <description>Alriiiigghtttt since this question is pretty general, and I&#39;m not sure where exactly to post it anyway, I figured I&#39;d post it here.  Yes, I do own a Mac, and yes I am a gamer.  I own the thing because I make films and I need a Mac to use my preferred editing software.  That being said, I&#39;d just like to say that Mac computers are actually very ideal for gaming, hardware-wise.  They are built with ideal specs for running even the most costly of games very well.  ANYWAY:

About a year ago I loaded a program called CrossOver Games on my MacBook.  I have a DirectX9 graphics card, but when I ran steam games through that program (such as Half-Life 2 and so-on), I could only play on DX level 8 for some reason, it wouldn&#39;t let me enable DirectX9.

I&#39;m betting the cause for this is because of the fact that my computer was essentially trying to run two operating systems at once, which caused some trouble.

Now that Steam is being released for Mac soon and I should be able to run all the games legitimately, will I encounter that problem or should I be able to run games with DX9-level quality?

Thanks for your help and interest.:3</description>

<p>I never really had a problem with mac users, or the OS itself. If they prefer the operating system, then fine, more power to em. But I have met a few mac users that talk about it like its the Master-OS, and will use every opportunity to let you know how much better than Windows it is. The “I’m a Mac, and I’m a PC” commercials didn’t help either.So when situations creep up where PC’s obviously beat out Macs in some area, I take a small measure of pride. I know there are several PC people like that too, but they don’t try to annoy me with their claims since we share a common OS.</p>

<p>Yeah, I titled this page very poorly.  I more wanted this page to be for mac users to discuss Steam coming for the mac, and to clear up a question I had (See the first post).</p>

<p>Then prove him wrong. You constantly accuse people of having no evidence and so on, yet you never bother to disprove them. If you think someone is saying something that is wrong, then disprove them. Go out and find some games that are significantly cheaper on the mac than on the pc.</p>

</aside>
<p>Give it up Loony, will all know mac gaming pales in comparison to pc gaming. In fact, it’s hardly even a comparison. I’d like to point out that there are about 1 or 2 “next gen” games on that list. The bottom line is, if you’re a gamer, don’t buy a mac.</p>

            <p>The problem with gaming for the Mac is that the majority of the games listed usually aren’t carried in-stock at the local Mac Store itself (at least not MY local Mac Store).  When I wanted to get The Sims 2, I had to order it online and have it specially ordered in, which they charged me extra for.</p>

Try adding Age of Empires, America’s Army, American McGee’s Alice, Battlefield 1942/2142, Bioshock, CoD/2/4, Civ 4, C&amp;C 3/Tiberium Wars/Generals/Red Alert 3, Dragon Age, EVE Online, Fallout 2, Guitar Heroes, Halo, Harry Potters, Homeworld 2, LotR: RotK, Need for Speed: Carbon, Myst IV/V, Neverwinter Nights/2, Knights of the Old Republic, Rome: Total War, SimCity 4, Star Wars (lots of 'em), Starcraft II, Tales of Monkey Island, Warcraft III, WoW, X2 and X3 to that list.</p>
<p>So yeah, there’s just nothing to play.</p>

            <p>I’ve got WINE working very successfully with a lot of games (Deus Ex, Half Life, Modern Warfare 2), all of which are running DirectX 9. Post any issues if you have them.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for more info on gaming for Mac, Google Winebottler and go to the website. Poking around with that is good fun. The WINE website and info on that should work the same for Winebottler, so go check it out.</p>
<p>Also: Apparently the Source engine is coming to Mac?</p>

            <p>You can get some pretty cool games for mac, but only with piracy, so yeah… Which doesn’t stop me. What does stop me is a sucky graphics card, but oh well.</p>

            <p>The extent of Mac gaming is The Sims 3, DooM, Quake, and Lego games, nothing more.  I own a Mac, yes, but I don’t use it for gaming.  Obviously I don’t use it for gaming.</p>

            <p>I never got this. Do you consider running bootcamp to fire up Xp and playing games as actually playing games on a mac. Seems strange hearing the mac crowd using this as a “macs can play games too” argument. Especially nowadays, seems like when you stop using OS X your mac ceases to exist as a mac.</p>

<p>That being said, I’d just like to say that Mac computers are actually very ideal for gaming, hardware-wise.  They are built with ideal specs for running even the most costly of games very well.</p>

            <p>I would dual boot, but I don’t have enough hard drive space.  I’m planning on getting an external for all of my macintosh applications and documents, etc. then partitioning my drive to dual boot it with windows xp.</p>
<p>However, my money situation being what it is, that is VERY far-off from happening.  Believe me, I would have by now if I could. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Also, to acristoff, I don’t care which is “better”.  I use Mac OSX because my preferred editing software, the Final Cut Suite, is only operable with Mac.:jizz:</p>
