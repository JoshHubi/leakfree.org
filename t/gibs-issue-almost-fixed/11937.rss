    <title>Gibs issue almost fixed</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gibs-issue-almost-fixed/11937</link>
    <description>From my last thread I have told you all I had an issue with the gibs. Weapons that were suppose to dismember were no longer doing so on surface tension and beyond. Well I deleted most of my saves and cache in the game (which I think was the problem) and got as far as the part where I am using a 50. cal gunning vortigaunts. 

When I hopped on the 50. cal and gunned away the gibs stopped working again. Idk if this game has some auto mature content filter that keeps turning itself on but if someone does know please tell me were it is located. Kinda kills the gorey fun for me :/</description>
