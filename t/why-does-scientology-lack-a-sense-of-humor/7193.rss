    <description>I finished listening to an interview with the south park guys about their Mormon musical. The Mormon Church, while not all embracing of the musical, acknowledged it and let it be. Why can&#39;t Scientology do this.  I see a lot of humor about jewish culture from jews. Even a few reformed Christians can laugh about their faith, why not Scientology?</description>

            <p>Because they’re mostly a bunch of overpaid and underbrained Hollywood new-age doofuses. It also doesn’t help that their leadership <span class="bbcode-i">insists</span> on them being offended by any jokes thrown their way.</p>
<p>If I believed in something as stupid and obviously fraudulent as Scientology, I’d be pretty defensive too.</p>

<p>Any person or organisation unable of stopping the charade of identity and power, if only for a moment, and unable of using this moment of pause to laugh about himself / herself / itself, is in danger, and I would say irrevocably, of succumbing to fanatism. That is why every king always has his jokers. And why democracies need political satire in order to exist. And this is why I will oppose Scientology, as long as they do not prove that they are tolerant towards the idea that every single human being is a retarded animal (including me and L. Ron Hubbard) and that we have no idea what we are actually doing most of the time.</p>
<p>Imagine Scientology admitting that some of the Scientology-parodies are actually pretty hillarious. What would happen? Their claim that Dianetics/The church/auditing are the only way to perceive reality would be nullified, because they would admit there is truth in the words of their critics, who have a diametrically opposed world view. Their members would begin to understand that they have paid incredible amounts of capital to an enterprise/church hybrid (bit of a pleonasm) selling them a ticket to a community of similarily excluded people simply in need of a hug and a really funny philosophy in return.</p>
<p>That said, I think both the organization and the philosophy will end badly unless their own members initiate self-parody. Something like auditing-jokes, or making fun of the members above them in hierarchy, or deriding their “secret service” like agency. Something …</p>

            <p>Religion is not about faith, it is mostly just a theory that gives a simple, but fake answer to life, the universe and everything. After it has got your belief, they get your life, making rules about how to life and limit parts of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, members of the church consider their religion as a “alternative to psychology”. Even trough their main intention is to make you feel depressed and committing your life to try to make you feel better, taking your money on the way.</p>
<p>Also, Scientology doesn’t follow science, it follows science <span class="bbcode-b">fiction</span>.</p>
