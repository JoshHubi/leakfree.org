    <title>hl1 radio jamers missing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl1-radio-jamers-missing/12609</link>
    <description>Ok lot of people did not know this in the original games hecu actually had devices to inhibit teleportation which does make sence because who want to go to sleep in a complex where at any moment you could have a whole mess of head crabs appear right above your head.

now what they looked like was just a simple radio
Well turns out they were not what they appeared they may have been used as radio in some instances but that does not seem to be there main function.
they where set up by the marines to try and sop aliens being able to teleport straight onto there position or in the area. now proof of this comes in the level power up  where they first make there appearance

you encounter the device after despatching third group of marines. if you destroy it you start getting aliens teleporting right onto of your position. this is not the only instance where this happened to me some thing happened in surface tension and other level&#39;s in half life one it generally was a very bad idea destroying any of these devices because some times you have large numbers of aliens teleporting right on your head.

im mentioning this now because im currently playing the mod and iv noticed there missing and I was wondering if they dev&#39;s did not know about them and could they put them back in./</description>

            <p>Yeah, I don’t think that was ever a thing. It certainly won’t be going in the mod.</p>
