    <title>Alternate path? (Either in &quot;Blast Pit&quot; or &quot;Power Up&quot;)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/alternate-path-either-in-blast-pit-or-power-up/11804</link>
    <description>Unfortunately I can&#39;t remember which of the two levels I was playing, but I happened upon an elevator and then realized there was a grate that let me take ANOTHER path that involved lots of ladders (with a fall at the bottom), and a music track that I don&#39;t believe would have played had I taken the elevator. 

Was this path in Half-Life or added by the Black Mesa team? I was just curious because it was a moment that stood out to me and I know that you guys can answer this question for me XD.</description>

<p>In the original, you have no choice but to take a (really unnecessarily fancy) elevator. The ladder path didn’t exist.</p>

<p>There we go, and thats what I thought.</p>
<p>Really cool addition, as well as the music guys. Reminded me of the great moment in Half-Life 2 where you go under the bridge (which isn’t alternate of course).</p>

<p>Its in the beginning of Blast Pit around 00:53. He doesn’t use the alternate pathway though.</p>
<p>My question was if that was originally in Half-Life or if the developers added this moment. I just don’t remember from my playthrough.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t count that as an “alternate path” since both the elevator and ladders go the same way and are a few meters from each other… the only difference is an extra battery or health kit lol</p>

            <p>Do you remember what you were trying to do? either kill giant green tentacles or a giant blue armored monstrosity? That would narrow it down.</p>
