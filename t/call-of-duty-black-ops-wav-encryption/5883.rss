    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/call-of-duty-black-ops-wav-encryption/5883</link>
    <description>Im sure that everyone who has played black ops would know of it awsome soundtrack, but when i tried to get the soundtrack from the .iwd files (it works on CoD4, 5, and 6) the .wav files wont run :&#39;(. I am fairly certain that it is encrypted, so does anyone know how to decrypt them?</description>
