    <title>We need new H.E.V Suit players + Helmet questions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/we-need-new-h-e-v-suit-players-helmet-questions/14948</link>
    <description>I think this has been said before, but the current H.E.V Suit playermodel is long overdue for a makeover. It&#39;s rigging is kinda crappy and it still uses the old version of the suit.
While I&#39;m certain that the next update will include this, there is another thing that I would like to discuss (since it hasn&#39;t been shown what the helmet redesign will be (if any)): Why does the current version&#39;s helmet look so different than how it appeared in the original Half-Life?
This may be my own opinion, but I kinda like the look of Half-Life&#39;s helmet [i]more[/i] than I like Black Mesa&#39;s. It looks more like what a scientist would wear (leaning more towards the look of a hazmat suit), while the redesign looks like a mix of a space suit helmet and a motorcycle helmet. 

What was the reason for changing it, and (in the next patch) could it be redone to look like the original?

To better visualize this, I took some pleb-tier screenshots of what could be:

<p>We had intended to use the new HEV suit model as the MP playermodel back when Kevin made the new HEV suit (he even made an awesome helmet for it if I remember correctly), but we never got around to doing it because it was a huge amount of work and MP went pretty low down on our list of priorities as we ramped up work on Xen.</p>
<p>We are aware that the rigging on the suit in MP is kind of crappy and exhibits a lot of weirdness - it was a hack job if I remember correctly but there was no better way of doing it.</p>
<p>I’m imagining this is something we may tackle post-Xen (especially if we manage to get some coop action going). But we may also never get around to it, who knows. Hopefully this information is useful.</p>

<p>Coop action? As in “Cooperative mode”? Does that mean that Black Mesa Coop isn’t off the table!?</p>
