    <description>Yes yes I know, Game movies are most of the time terrible. However what would YOU do to make it better? Who would you cast for a movie based on a game? How would you do the film (in first person perhaps). Creativity tiem.</description>

            <p>wouldn’t it be better if it were made according to the HL2 story line ?  There’s more space for creativity and workarounds if needed and /or plot twists/drama etc. Also in the first game Gordon is playing the role of a survivalist scraping by ,trying to get to the surface,if anything it would just turn into a disaster movie</p>

            <p>actors != a good movie.</p>
<p>a convincing script, talented director, cinematographer, and editor do most of the heavy lifting. actors just play a part. good directors like tarintino can pull great performances out of no name hacks. so, let’s focus on how we’d want the movie to look/what kind of storyline/script we’d want instead.</p>
<p>also: robert downey jr is too busy being the planter’s peanut man.</p>

            <p>Agreed. And had Liam Neeson as one of the scientists. He could be one of the people who takes charge and helps people to the surface during the Resonance Cascade. At the end of the movie he is captured and executed by the HECU. In that way, the movie would be similar in tone and general flow to “Rome, Open City.” (an Italian neo-realist film from 1946. Really quite excellent, track down a copy if you can)</p>

            <p>I think Gordon would be best with a voice that isn’t particularly assumed to be “badass.” Something regular, kind of like some of the least nerdy/old man-sounding scientists in Black Mesa.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t expect a theoretical physicist to do what he does, so the voice would add to it.</p>
