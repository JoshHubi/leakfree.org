<p>My $19.99 should give me a little more than “when it’s done.”  This is no longer a mod, this is a paid video game.  I would ask the same about fixes/completions of any other piece of software I have paid for.  That last 9 years of me following the mod  was different. Now it is not</p>

</aside>
<p>The “when its done” approach was clearly written on the store page, where we stated that:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“We feel it will take us considerable time to get the last 15% up to our standards, and putting a time estimate on it would be a total guess.”</span></p>
<p>We are sorry if you’re unhappy with that, but if you didn’t like that, you could have waited to buy the game when we added Xen instead of purchasing the early access. We will give you guys a time estimate when we are comfortable with it. The development process is extremely complicated and hard to predict. We are aiming to deliver Xen within a reasonable timeframe, all things considered.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure if you’re acting entitled because you payed, knowing it didn’t include Xen, but you’re still not entitled to a release date before they can give you an accurate one.</p>

            <p>Yes.  When Xen is complete, your purchased copy of Black Mesa will be automatically updated through Steam to include the Xen chapters.  It’ll be “free” if you’ve purchased the game.</p>
