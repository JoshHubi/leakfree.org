    <title>The assassins</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-assassins/653</link>
    <description>A few suggestions for the assassin NPC:

1. In HL1, the assassins mostly avoided the direct contact with the player by running and jumping away.
I could imagine that it would make sense, if the assassins would go into a direct confrontation sometimes and not only shooting from the distance and for example try to stab the player in close combat, especially if you stand with your back to them.

They could jump at you from a higher position for melee attacking.

I think the melee abilities (punching, kicking and the use of their dagger) of this enemy should also more show to advantage in general.

2. Also it would be cool, if the assassins could perform a few more athletic movements than in in the original. Like doing a roundoff. I could imagine, that the movie Matrix would also give you some inspiration for great fighting movements.

3. They should be able to jump onto higher objects (like a container) from the ground.</description>

            <p>Ok… I am new to this thread, but this collides with hl2 beta; Because you are using the source engine for half-life 2, you may end up with a very buggy assassin! The assassin was buggy even in hl1!</p>
<p>Also, if you are using a backstab action, you would think this is easy scripting (L0L it really is). But you have to think of why the hydra NPC did not get in the original half life 2, even when it had some awesome AI and stuff; the player will sometimes not know who killed him/her then it will cause frustration witch will minimize the game experience!</p>

<p>That’s some mod you can download for HL. It just replaces a few maps with teh needed level change tweaks, and then add the new maps there. Wherever you got it from must have had that installed. You may be able to remove it, but I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Edit: I’d need to know if the models are dumped right into the folders, or actually in .pak files. I’m not really sure. You know you can just use programs like Boot Camp that let you run Windows on a Mac, right?</p>

            <p>That’s not so much out of the question or ‘too advanced’ in terms of what the engines are capable of, it’s not something that would be implemented because it would be god damn annoying. What if she knocked away your crowbar &amp; you couldn’t or didn’t bother to find it after? Not to mention all the other horrible &amp; annoying shit it could result in.</p>
<p>Blocking the crowbar would just be pointless.</p>

<p>Nice ideas.  I think that the Assasins are a great opportunity for some really spectacular AI and animations.  Also, as these are assasins obviously trained in advanced martial arts,  a cool new mechanic would be the ability to disarm you of your currently equipped weapon for you to take back once you kill the bitch.  Of course, that’s probably too advanced and too far beyond the limits of classic HL mechanics.  Maybe make it so the Assasin is able to block some strikes from your crowbar, should you manage to get close enough to get a swing at her.</p>

            <p>No, currently we don’t really know what’s coming, they said “the Half-Life series” is coming, but no one really knows what exactly that means. For example, I’m sure HL1 will be available, however, maybe they will want to only port the HL: Source version, since it’s easier for them. However, the Source version doesn’t work with all the awesome mods for HL. I would love it if the original, non-Source HL would make it to the Mac, because of the mods (and the feeling of nostalgia).</p>

<p>Can’t believe no-one pointed out yet that the cloaking behaviour had nothing to do with the high-def pack, but the difficulty level. Play on Hard and they cloak whenever they’re not shooting you. Play on any other difficulty level and they don’t.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I didn’t know that indeed! But I swear I’ve always played on Hard, and I only noticed the cloaking thing when I installed the High-Def Pack on another machine… But it’s possible that my first installation was slightly modified so the “hard” and “easy” mode didn’t change anything, they all did what “medium” did. Well, that’s how I remember it… By the way, is there a way to uninstall the high-def pack? I hate it anyway!</p>

<p>Really? In a game where you have to fight a giant crustacean with a single 500 pound testicle? You consider the ASSASSINS to be the most comical?!</p>

<p>I think we should have a whole chapter dedicated to these girls and possibly to add the male ones from opposing forces. I can just imagine a chapter were the lights go out and all you here is foot steps running around and bullets flying while you have to rely on the trusty torch.</p>
<p>Off topic: first post yes.</p>
