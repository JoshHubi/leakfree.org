    <title>WiFi in Ubuntu</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wifi-in-ubuntu/5027</link>
    <description>So basically, I can connect to almost any unsecured wifi network in Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows XP. But with a WEP secured network (the only kind I can connect to right now) I can only gain Internet access in Windows. I really don&#39;t want this, because the ONLY thing I use Windows for is gaming. Is there any way to connect to this network in Ubuntu? Or both windows and ubuntu? I will reward each and every one of you with in advance with a cookie.  :wink:</description>
