    <title>What is the most important thing to teach a child</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-the-most-important-thing-to-teach-a-child/13370</link>
    <description>Children will encounter and absorb many things in their lives. You can expect them to learn a great deal of important things on their own accord, but some things must be taught-- either by chance or design, something special must occur to help this child become a better human being.

What should it be? What is the most important lesson a child should learn, but risks passing up? What is the best principle you can pass along to give this child a better chance at a healthy and happy life?

I am not seeking humor here (lord knows we get enough of that in other threads) but, instead, your honest opinions. But I&#39;m not looking for a checklist of commandments... I want you to express what you think is the singular most important thing a child should learn.

...

So far, personally, I am leaning toward &quot;[u]to never abuse power[/u]&quot;. Benevolence is a trait that marks the best people. People must be trustworthy when they&#39;re put in charge. It&#39;s what socipathic machiavellians fail to grasp-- it&#39;s a trait that separates [i]family you hope to visit[/i] and [i]family you dread asking you for money[/i].

Now for your thoughts?</description>

            <p>Being myself, even though it thrust plenty of hardship on me, made me who I am. I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t have the stubbornness to stand up for myself and what I believe in. So many people these days just phase through social groups like chameleons, afraid to find their own sense of identity for fear that having an identity will push people away.</p>
<p>Anyone who is pushed away by who you are isn’t worth your time. What you believe in can change, and reasoned debate is always great, but someone who rejects your beliefs out of hand and uses them to judge you is also not worth your time. At least, that’s my opinion.</p>

</aside>
<p>Lying is a part of life, sometimes ethically justified, in a way that honesty is overshadowed as “most important thing”. If your one tenet is honesty, it will leave you vulnerable, and it will benefit you/everyone less than if you focused instead on something else.</p>
<p>I still side with “Never abuse power”. Trust is a form of power-- <span class="bbcode-i">The Boy Who Cried Wolf</span> contains one of the best morals to be learned. It teaches risks of lying (as opposed to benefits of truth).</p>
<p>I agree with Bur when he says:</p>

            <p>Personally I find that goodwill and understanding are more valuable than honesty in itself.</p>
<p>If you are generally and unconditionally open and empathetic towards anyone, people pick up on it and tend to be nicer and more honest towards you in return. At least in my experience.<br>
It also makes you vulnerable at times, but it’s more than worth it in my opinion.</p>
<p>Vulnerability is not weakness.</p>

            <p>Well sometimes honesty isn’t always the best thing. It’s kind of a gray area imo. There are things you should always tell the truth about, and then there are things that you should think about telling people before just saying a truth or a lie about it.</p>

            <p>I think neither one is effective without the other. You can’t beat someone and instill hate and fear and expect the best, just like you can’t spoil and reward someone and expect the best. Everything in moderation, and definitely never too extreme for rewards or punishments, that’s my view.</p>

<li>Live in the moment (peace of mind without indifference)</li>
