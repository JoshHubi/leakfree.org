16 minutes of pure awesome.

Certainly beats the shit out of Beyond Black Mesa when it comes to respecting the source material.</description>

<p>also i agree this was better than BBM, because i actually enjoyed the characters,<br>
I think if BBM had made me feel anything for adrian shepard or that fat chinese guy (like escape from city 17 did) then with the post production it would have been awesome-cakes but a shame that it was so bad  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>It’s not just that they didn’t stick to the source meterial, they left something that is a key element of half life out.<br>
I mean combine with samurai swords…it’s farfetched but maybe there are special units, that would’ve been ok.<br>
However headcrabless zombies just does not fir into the half life universe at all. 1. How are they zombies 2. does this mean headcrabs don’t exist 3. Did I mention there’s no headcrabs on those zombies?</p>
<p>You can turn a fan movie of something into your own storyline and change some things or add others but missing out something as vital as having headcrabs on zombies is a huge mistake.</p>

            <p>I am incapable of proper thought at the moment but what I am trying to say here is that because it’s a film based off another intellectual property, taking any little steps away from that somehow makes it bad (according to the target audience). They were repeatedly shooting themselves in the foot by basing it on half life, and then not sticking with the source material.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows Half-Life knows what they were supposed to be. The very fact we’re discussing this proves that the film is terrible as if you have ever played half life you know the zombies are supposed to have headcrabs on them. Leaving them out just makes a half arsed attempt at a Half Life fan film.</p>

            <p>It’s just that most of the humor was Fallout, and red being very irrelevant to it made her jokes didn’t fly as well due to not taking the wind of being video game related. Probably not explaining it well.</p>

<p>I think Red being painfully average looking with the irritating diva personality made her character. She’d have no purpose if she looked good.</p>

            <p>I’ve always considered good cinematics as relative as good writing or good art direction. Yes there are general rules for it and you can generally tell if its quality is good or bad, but at the end of the day, it all comes down to whether or not you like the style, and I happen to like the style of BBM.</p>

<p>You’d be correct! If your point weren’t a straw man, that is.</p>
<p>I was responding to this statement specifically:</p>

</aside>
<p>In terms of which was more “cinematic” I think the fact that I work in this industry and have to edit things like this on a daily basis isn’t totally irrelevant.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>It’s still mostly subjective – that goes without saying – but I think there are objective points to be made on which is closer to something you’d see in a cinema, and there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s Nuka Break.</p>

            <p>They just cover different ends of a spectrum. One is action oriented and one is character oriented. In their respective fields they work, but I just found BBM more enjoyable and thus a better product. It says nothing bad of the other.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In my professional opinion, Nuka Break is miles above BBM. Beyond Black Mesa fell into the same trap that a lot of the special effects majors at my college fell into with their films: the cinematography was flashy, but it wasn’t actually <span class="bbcode-i">motivated</span>, and the story more or less existed to service the special effects.</p>
<p>Nuka Break focused on the story and characters, and even though the cinematography and editing were less flashy, they both serviced the storytelling in very specific ways, which is a much more difficult thing to achieve. It was actually very well directed, whereas BBM was really workmanlike.</p>
<p>Put another way, the people who directed and shot Nuka Break could easily be working on feature films or high-end television. The same can’t be said of the BBM people, aside from the visual effects people.</p>
