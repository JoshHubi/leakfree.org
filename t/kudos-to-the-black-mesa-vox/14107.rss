    <title>Kudos to the Black Mesa Vox</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/kudos-to-the-black-mesa-vox/14107</link>
    <description>I was wondering how I would do a Black Mesa Vox (PA system) in my map.  My experiments to use my own voice in Audacity weren&#39;t going so well.  So, I decided to see what lines already existed.  And, to my surprise, I was delighted to see that you guys implemented the vox on a word-by-word basis!  That&#39;s freakin&#39; awesome!  I was able to retrofit my intended dialog to use these existing words.  Really cool.</description>

            <p>Heh, neat, I hadn’t noticed that.<br>
It was missing from the mod version (due to an error in a junk-file remover, IIRC) but now that the entirety of the vox lines are back, it seems they elected to do it HL1 style.</p>
<p>Which is good, because HL1’s vox was designed for mappers to have full flexibility on the lines.</p>
