    <description>I have a save file that exists right before I jump into the Lambda Core. If I bought the steam version, would I be able to load that file and jump to Xen. Also, is any of the new steam content going to be between the beginning and Xen? Would I be missing anything if I started where I left off?</description>

            <p>I think it was implied in the official announcement in November that the Steam release would come before Xen.</p>
<p>I say this because of this post</p>

<p>At the top it says the Steam release is ‘Soon’</p>
<p>But down below it says “Xen is still a ways off.”</p>

Xen will be a while…</p>

<p>There will probably be some small differences between the current version of the map and the Steam version. Even one change is enough to corrupt a save file. So, no. Besides, the Steam version is built upon a different engine branch, so there’s little chance it would work anyway.</p>

<p>Xen is not coming with the first Steam release.</p>

</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>its not clear whether or not the stema release will include xen, it is clear it xen would stil take a while and the steam version be released “soon”, however they are both arguable, so it might still end up on the same time</p>

            <p>The Steam version is on a new engine 100% certain the saves won’t work.</p>
<p>The Mod version is also on a updated version of the engine mods are allowed to use, so I’m also sure it won’t work there as well.</p>

            <p>Doing a new playthrough is the only sensible thing to do in the Steam version. You’ll want to see all the improvements at least, besides any possible new content.</p>

            <p>You could always copy the save files and move them from the sourcemods folder to wherever the new one will be. I doubt it would work but it’s worth a shot. If it doesn’t work, you could skip to the xen maps using the console. When I get the steam copy, I’m going to do another playthrough though. Apparently, there will be more content in the game. Wouldn’t want to miss it!</p>
