    <title>No audio at all (Had some problem with another source mod)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-audio-at-all-had-some-problem-with-another-source-mod/11505</link>
    <description>Im going to assume this is not the games fault, but more of a software (Not hardware) issue on my end. Im using Logitech speakers and a subwoofer (Not sure of model but very generic) with realtek HD audio. Ive seen a few posts here about it on google but no one answered.</description>

<p>Post your specs.</p>
<p>Are your drivers updated?</p>
<p>Have you tried to modify your audio configuration to simple stereo(no subwoofer)?</p>
<p>Sounds like an issue with Source 2007.</p>

<p>I remember when I was trying the other mod I had the same issue. I googled it and I read up that installing HL2E2 might possibly fix the issue but I was too lazy. Im gonna try that now</p>
<p>Gonna try the audio configs too</p>
