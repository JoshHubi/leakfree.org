            <p>But my generation forgot (havent been taught this) so we will have to learn the hard way. After a couple of other serious threats to Western freedom I think we will learn but we will die and our children won’t have learnt and so it continues and so their paranoia tactics will continue working.</p>

            <p>I think that would have to be coupled with a wish to terrorize some people. Terrorists need to instill terror in people by terrorizing them? They are just signs the government uses to base their preliminary assumptions. Unless your actually using that to fuck up some security in order to blow up some shit I can’t imagine it’d be a problem.</p>
<p>By default the word terrorist can’t lose its meaning, however people can have a warped/overly sensitive view of its meaning.</p>
<p>Then again one persons terrorist is another persons freedom fighter. I think in that case though it’s a moral/numbers game. The more people that think a group/someone is a terrorist, the more they become one?</p>
<p>It’s very tricky. All in all though, if your trying to instill fear into people by means of doing awfull extreme things you’l more than likely fit into the catagory. Again though, it’s all subjective, Again again though, so if everything.</p>

<p>It’s not that the word has lost it’s definition it’s that the definition is <span class="bbcode-i">extremely</span> broad.</p>
<p>terrorism [ter-uh-riz-uhm]<br>
ter·ror·ism   [ter-uh-riz-uhm]<br>
noun<br>
1.the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.<br>
2.the state of fear and submission produced by terrorism or terrorization.<br>
3.a terroristic method of governing or of resisting a government.</p>
<p>So, I don’t think it lost it’s definition at all.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So, who of you truly believes that all terrorists are people who blow shit up?</p>
<p>I’m not saying that the FBI is correct in labeling pirates as terrorists, but a “terrorist” isn’t a term exclusively used to define someone who blows things up.</p>
<p>The “terrorist” label can be applied to anyone who causes social unrest and/or chaos by placing terror in the hearts of civilians through the means of unlawful actions. So in a way piracy could be viewed as terrorism in the eyes of someone who thinks that structured and organized capitalism is the glue that keeps mankind together.</p>
<h2>[COLOR=‘Gray’]-----<br>
The text in this post above this bit was before I read the article, below is after I read it</h2>
<p>Anyway. Not sure if anyone actually read that flyer (odds are “nope”), but it doesn’t say anywhere that “if you like privacy, you’re a terrorist”, it merely points out a few things that might make someone suspicious. So for those of you who haven’t, this is the list of suspicious signs:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">People Who:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Are overly concerned about privacy, attempts to shield the screen from view of others</li>
<li>Always pay cash or use credit card(s) in different name(s)</li>
<li>Apparently use tradecraft: lookout, blocker or someone to distract employees</li>
<li>Act nervous or suspicious behavior inconsistent with activities</li>
<li>Are observed switching SIM cards in cell phone or use of multiple cell phones</li>
<li>Travel illogical distance to use Internet Café</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Activities on Computer indicate:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Evidence of a residential based internet provider (signs on to Comcast, AOL, etc.)</li>
<li>Use of anonymizers, portals, or other means to shield IP address</li>
<li>Suspicious or coded writings, use of code word sheets, cryptic ledgers, etc.</li>
<li>Encryption or use of software to hide encrypted data in digital photos, etc.</li>
<li>Suspicious communications using VOIP or communicating through a PC game</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Use Computers to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Download content of extreme/radical nature with violent themes</li>
<li>Gather information about vulnerable infrastructure or obtain photos, maps or diagrams of transportation, sporting venues, or populated locations</li>
<li>Purchase chemicals, acids, hydrogen peroxide, acetone, fertilizer, etc.</li>
<li>Download or transfer files with “how-to” content such as:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Content of extreme/radical nature with violent themes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Anarchist Cookbook, explosives or weapons information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Military tactics, equipment manuals, chemical or biological information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Terrorist/revolutionary literature</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Preoccupation with press coverage of terrorist attacks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Defensive tactics, police or government information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Information about timers, electronics, or remote transmitters / receivers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what on this list is so far fetched? Is there anything on there that isn’t suspicious or weird? Hell, if I saw someone shielding his screen, using different credit cards under different names, communicating with someone else in code and looking up how-to-make-a-bomb on the internet (I saw this because he didn’t shield his screen properly), I’d inform the police as well.</p>
<p>This list isn’t “if you see someone do one of these things, he’s a terrorist”, it’s merely a list of suspicious behavior that could indicate something bigger. You won’t get arrested because someone saw you playing a shooter or watching a movie of 2 chavs having a fight in downtown Glasgow.</p>
<p>Fuck, why did I post this? It’s like talking to a remarkably thick wall here. Take away the free shit of you kids and you rage all over the internet, sharing all sorts of uninformed articles on conspiracy theory websites.</p>
