Note the top link&#39;s an up-to-date feed, this is an article on the early side of the investigation:

Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- Nearly 20 people died Friday in an elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

At least 10 of the dead at Sandy Hook Elementary School were children, the source said. At a news conference Friday afternoon, state police Lt. Paul Vance would say only that there had been &quot;several fatalities.&quot;

The school was secure, and the public was not in danger, Vance said.

&quot;Why? Why?&quot; one woman wailed as she walked up a wooded roadway leading from the school.

A parent who was inside the school at the time of the attack said she heard what sounded like at least 100 rounds being fired. She said she saw two school employees who had died.

Hospital officials in neighboring Danbury said they were treating three people wounded in the shooting. Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton said the victims were in &quot;very serious&quot; condition.

The shooter is dead, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN&#39;s Susan Candiotti. The suspect&#39;s body is in a classroom at the school, the source said.

A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said a male was being questioned but he is not being called a suspect.

Federal officers in tactical gear were on the scene, coordinating with local and state police. At least four ambulances remained at the school Friday afternoon.

Police have recovered two weapons from the suspect, a Glock and a Sig Sauer, the source said. It&#39;s unclear if police killed the suspect.

&#39;It doesn&#39;t seem possible&#39; -- parents shocked by school shooting

Police and teachers rushed students from the building as police swarmed the area shortly after the first calls came in, around 9:40 a.m. ET. Officials moved students to a nearby firehouse, where parents frantically sought information about their children.

Third-grader Alexis Wasik said police and teachers barged into her classroom and told students to hide in the corner.

&quot;Everybody was crying,&quot; she said. &quot;And I just heard the police officers yelling.&quot;

Aerial images from CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey showed police officers armed with rifles following a dog into woods near the school.

Other officers, some in tactical gear, stood around the school with guns drawn, CNN affiliate WFSB reported.

All schools in the city were on lockdown Friday as police assessed the situation, Vance said.

Gov. Dan Malloy is &quot;horrified&quot; by what happened, a spokesman said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration feels &quot;enormous sympathy&quot; for affected families and pledged federal support for state and local law enforcement.

Newtown is about 60 miles north of New York.

            <p>You won’t choke on a Kinder egg either if your throat isn’t abnormal large. Any one who can get choked by a kinder egg must have a big mouth, those plastic containers are rather big.</p>
<p>Then there’s the point that any one eating a Kinder egg without splitting the chocolate egg first and removing the container is doing it wrong.</p>

            <p>Speaking of the news, I really think that the mass media handled the event exceptionally poorly. So much misinformation. Zero fact checking. All in the name of getting the latest scoop before the other news channels do.</p>
<p>They’re like vultures, literally feeding off of the dead. It’s disgusting.</p>

<p>On the other side of the argument, there are a lot of misconceptions and vitriol thrown at people that just want to have a discussion including, but not limited to, being called Nazis or whatever.</p>
<p>I, myself, have been called “fearful that a gun will suddenly jump up and fire at a bunch of schoolkids all by itself” and that I must be the dumbest person on Earth to believe such a thing…even though I’ve never said anything like that in my life nor do I believe that.</p>

<p>What I meant is that the way your country’s laws and regulations works, you simply breed social outcasts that see no other way out than doing shit like this, and your country isn’t doing an awful lot to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]You can blame that on those NRA people. There’s like this battle of ideals/culture in the US and especially in DC, between Democrats and Republicans. The current Republicans are the gun freaks.</p>
<p>Seriously, you can’t purchase alcohol when you’re under 21. In most states you can’t marry the one you love if it goes against an obscure and ancient standard proclaimed by a bundle of pressed pulp. You’re not allowed to use recreational drugs that have been used by mankind since the dawn of time, etc.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]I can agree to that.</p>
<p>But anyone can walk in and buy semi-automatic military grade firearms, provided of course that they can pay for them (oh wait, you can probably get a loan for that).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And I agree as well. You really find this kind of thing in Republican culture/states. What made me respond the way I did was that your post generalized the whole culture, not just the Republican culture, which bugged me.</p>

<p>Yes, these things always come down to “'murica rah rah”, I think the problem is a combination of American culture and mental/emotional health.<br>
Now, I’m a depressive, and I know quite a few depressives, but growing up, I and everyone else I know were taught in an atmosphere of “how lucky we are to live in a free country”, not how “we deserve to live in a free country”. Americans (in general) grow up learning to stand up for your rights, fight anyone who challenges your rights, you deserve your rights, make anyone pay for taking away your rights etc. It’s an incredibly selfish culture.  So when you get someone who is mentally/emotionally broken down, some of them don’t just feel hopeless and suicidal, they feel like making other people pay for it as well.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can agree that, but it’s something that you find again, in the Republican culture/states. The White House and a good part of the Senate are currently made up of people who oppose this kind of culture.</p>
