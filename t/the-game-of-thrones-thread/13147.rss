    <description>Yeah, I know. Imaginative title.

Great start to the 4th season.

Didn&#39;t know that they had recast Daario Naharis, so that took me by surprise. I think I liked the previous actor better.

EDIT: 
Just in case it needs to be stated:

            <p>Finally finished A Dance with Dragons, so I’m completely caught up with the series now! \o/</p>
<p>It was good, too. George RR Martin has finally managed to make me feel genuinely bad about the (likely) death of a main character. (This is probably a major spoiler if you only follow the show.) [[color=’<span class="hashtag">#171717</span>’]Poor Jon Snow. I also felt pretty bad about Brienne, but someone spoiled that for me ahead of time, and also her fate has since been left up in the air. Jon’s stabbing hits especially hard, because he’s been a major character for five very long books.]</p>
<p>That said, I have no idea what was going on at the end of the book’s Epilogue. Am I missing something I should be connecting it with, or has GRRM really just introduced a completely new threat out of goddamn nowhere?</p>

            <p>From what I understand, the books and the show begin to move apart gradually. Someone correct me if I’m wrong. But eventually they will distinguish themselves from one another.</p>

            <p>So I’m not quite halfway through A Dance with Dragons and I’ve just started watching the TV show.</p>
<p>I’m finding it disconcerting, because almost none of the characters in the show look anything like I imagined them. Even some of the locations and castles are different how I pictured them. It took me way too long to figure out that one of the guys at Winterfell was Robb Stark, because not only was he totally different from the image in my head, [[color=’<span class="hashtag">#171717</span>’]I’d actually forgotten his character ever existed].</p>
<p>What’s really weird, though, is that the show follows the books so closely it’s almost boring. I’ve read most of these scenes, and seeing them acted out feels kinda repetitive. It’s to the creators’ credit, no doubt, but it’s a weird feeling.</p>

            <p>Nah, bowels.</p>
<p>Also, I was really hoping for Stannis the Mannis to show up at the end of episode 409.  That’s an example of something that doesn’t happen til just a bit later in the books but would be awesome to see on screen.  Think about it, Night’s Watch getting hammered, defeat is within sight, Ygritte is dead, Jon Snow is crouched over her corpse in complete resignation…only for the attack to suddenly be repelled.  Armored riders arrive, bearing unfamiliar (to the denizens of the wall and the Wildlings) banners, and the chants of “STANNIS!  STANNIS!  STANNIS!”.  Credits roll.</p>

            <p>Sure, but they could’ve put Stannis’ arrival on the previous episode instead of making it solely about the siege. That way they would have had enough time on the last episode to treat this properly.</p>

            <p>It also potentially fucks up any future reunion that Jaime and Tyrion may have, since in the books their parting was very rough, but here it was all hugs and kisses.</p>
<p>Also, everything after Tyrion learns about Tysha is in a dull dizzy haze, and it is in this haze that Tyrion kills Shae in <span class="bbcode-i">cold blood</span>.  It’s a rage so dull and defining that he is emotionally vacant.  It’s not a murder that’s partially in self-defense.  He definitely doesn’t apologize afterwards.  She mockingly calls him her lion, and he twists the necklace around her neck and then goes off to search for his father.  Shae is hardly mentioned in their conversation.  Instead, they discuss Tysha, what happened to her, and where she ended up.  Tywin calls her a whore, Tyrion threatens him not to use that word then asks where she went.  Tywin responds “Wherever whores go.”  Enter crossbow shot to the bowels and the revelation that Tywin, in the end, did not in fact shit gold.</p>

<p>Eh, that’s not it.  If that were it, they could have spent less time and money on that beetles monologue, the ridiculous skeleton fight, or the tiring Meereen scenes and Daenerys’ titles of varying length.</p>
<p>It has more to do with the pacing, flow, and overall thematic structure of each season.  There’s a lot to put in each season if they were totally faithful to the books, and plenty of that doesn’t translate to screen well.  It’s a shame, since what was on paper was magnificent and what is on screen is a condensed abridged version.  Still good, don’t get me wrong, but the character development, plotting, and overall airtight consistency  and story arcs pale in comparison next to the novel.  I just hope more and more show watchers are inspired by what the see on screen to read the marvelous books one of the best television shows currently being aired is based off of.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think it’s ok to talk about Tysha. It doesn’t contain spoilers about future events in the series, but rather how the show chose to handle Tyrion’s storyline differently.</p>
<p>Read on if you wanna know what actually happened in the books (again, <span class="bbcode-b">no show spoilers</span> of any kind):</p>
<p>[color=’<span class="hashtag">#131313</span>’]Tysha was Tyrion’s first wife. After marrying her, his family tells him that she was a whore and just wanted money; and that he had been tricked into marrying her. <span class="bbcode-i">How could someone love a monstrosity like him</span>? Then they sent the whole army to rape her and forced him to watch. This bit of the story was featured on the earlier seasons of the show, not sure which one though.</p>
<p>Before sending him off with Varys, Jamie confesses that Tysha actually wasn’t a whore, she was just a peasant girl who really loved Tyrion. This essentially <span class="bbcode-i">breaks </span>Tyrion. He snaps and starts to tell Jamie things to piss him off; his own brother had let the only woman who had ever loved him suffer so much, he had let Tyrion suffer so much. So he tells him that Cersei has been fucking Lancel, and that he actually <span class="bbcode-b">had </span>poisoned Joffrey (although he hadn’t actually done so). The discovery of this lie is THE reason why he decides to go and kill Shae and Tywin.</p>
<p>The way they handled it on the show was cleaner but it feels like Tyrion’s actions didn’t have as much justification.</p>
