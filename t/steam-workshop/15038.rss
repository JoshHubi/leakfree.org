    <description>Hi,

maybe a stupid question but how can I upload custom maps to Black Mesa workshop? I tried blackmesa_publish.exe but somehow it doesn&#39;t work.
I selected my mod folder (inside that folder I have my .vpk), the upload progress bar showed up and it looked like it uploaded something but when I look up my submitted items via steam there is only an empty new entry with 0 MB filesize and no thumbnail. What size (resolution) do I have to use for my workshop item thumbnail? What version of Black Mesa do I need to submit files to the workshop?</description>

            <p>I think the important part is the aspect ratio. After they fixed it three dozen fixes ago it got more picky. I used to use 16:9 screenshots but only 1:1 images work for me now.</p>

            <p>Shouldn’t need to have it as 512x512, mine aren’t and the mods seems to work (mostly) on steamworkshop.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Ok cool it worked! I think it did not work because my thumbnail wasn’t 512x512… I changed it from 800x600 to 512x512 and now it worked.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Thx!</p>

            <p>Make sure you open the folder with the .vpk in blackmesa_publish.<br>
It won’t show any files, but just hit ok or whatever.</p>
<p>So don’t just select it, make sure you open it.<br>
Also open up your .vpk so you see its made correct, do you have a maps folder in it?</p>

            <p>Should work fine on the public branch, but last I tested I was on the beta branch. Make sure your thumbnail is 1:1, I use 512*512.</p>
