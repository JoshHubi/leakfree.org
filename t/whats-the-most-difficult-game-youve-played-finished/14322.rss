    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/whats-the-most-difficult-game-youve-played-finished/14322</link>
    <description>For me, [b][i]Grabbed by the Ghoulies[/i][/b] is one of the most difficult games I&#39;ve completed. Once you get gold medals on all 20 extra challenges (Which unlock one at a time for every 5 secret books you find in the main game)  you unlock Challenge 21 which is replaying the main game again with limited health and no power ups. I heavily relied on these power ups scattered across the levels for health, invincibility, and instant kills on my first playthrough, especially for the final boss (Which will one hit kill you if it touches you, or if you hit it wrong). Words can&#39;t describe my anger when my save got corrupted a couple months after I beat it.

Ignoring games where the difficultly can come from random chance and terrible controls, [b][i]Holy Diver[/i][/b] on the Famicom is probably the hardest game I&#39;ve ever played. If I were to quickly describe the game I&#39;d call it Castlevania on steroids. It starts out slightly difficult in the first stage but its true nature isn&#39;t revealed until the 3rd and 4th stage. You have a standard fireball attack which you can always use, though it&#39;s usually a last resort. Your main weapons though are the 5 spells that you unlock one by one at the beginning of each stage. All the spells are extremely useful from stopping some enemies in their tracks, shots that pierce through foes, orbs that spin around you, and a screen clearing thunder blast. Despite the difficulty I&#39;m having a lot of fun figuring out strategies for getting past tricky parts. I recommend giving it a try if you like action platformers.</description>

<p>I second this. I remember the sometimes horrible platforming (leading to multiple deaths and furious saving). I might just play it again in the near future with an HD upgrade mod.</p>

            <p>Far Cry 1 my favourite FC . I’d say it’s more more difficult because of its unfairness  but still yea, good one  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Crysis also, not that much since you have the suit but it can be hard sometimes if you do something stupid  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I still play both games to this day.</p>

            <p>I <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">love</span></span> the original Deus Ex. Realistic mode is brutal, too. One or two good shots kills you, making the augs more useful and meaningful.</p>

            <p>Hmm not sure if this is the hardest game I’ve ever played ever, but I had to really push myself to finish Ninja Gaiden Black. And I never finished Master Ninja mode because hot damn…</p>
<p>(For reference, this is <span class="bbcode-i">that annoying game</span> whose max health upgrade increases the maximum health you can have, but <span class="bbcode-i">doesn’t increase your current health along with it</span>.)</p>
<p>(EDIT: This is also <span class="bbcode-i">that annoying game</span> that basically pits you, a ninja, against soldiers whose unblockable “throw” move is to impale you on a rifle bayonet and fire an M203 grenade into your gut… while you’re still impaled on the bayonet.)</p>

            <p>The number one hardest game I’ve ever beaten is a toss up between Dark Souls (any of them really, as well as Bloodborne) and then motherfucking Iron Storm on the hardest setting. Fuck. That. Game.</p>

            <p>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was one of the hardest games I beat in recent years. The last boss is a pain in the ass and basically requires you to use every skill you need to learn throughout the game in order to beat him.</p>
<p>Currently I’m playing through The Witcher 3 and it’s been fairly difficult at times and I can see how it could get progressively more difficult as I level up and get bigger monster hunting contracts, not to mention the enemies of the main quest.</p>

            <p>Most difficult game I’ve tried is Cave Story on hard. You don’t get any health upgrades so any attack more powerful than a gentle breeze kills you instantly. Made it up to Monster X and couldn’t get past it due to how many projectiles filled up the screen. The hell level may have actually been easier because it’s not as much full of insane projectiles as much as high-damage enemies. With no health upgrades it doesn’t matter if the falling rocks do 20 damage or 3 damage.</p>

<p>Portal Stories: Mel was really tough. After a two week delay in getting my motherboard replaced I finished it just today. Personally, I’d highly recommend it especially since it’s free!</p>

            <p>Hm…</p>
<p>I would say the most difficult game I’ve completed yet is Hotline Miami. I haven’t really played that many games that are considered insanely hard. I thought Portal and Portal 2 were fairly difficult at times and I had to look up some solutions. So far, Portal Stories Mel is even harder, but I haven’t had to look anything up yet.</p>
<p>That being said, some classics like Super Mario Bros. Lost Levels are tough as nails. Farthest I’ve ever made it is World 2.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that some games on Hard aren’t that hard. I decided to replay Half-Life 2 on Hard thanks to HL2 Update, and up to Ravenholm it hadn’t been very hard. Haven’t played in months, though. While replaying BioShock Infinite on Hard, it’s kinda hard but fair. I was pretty late in the game last time I played. Meanwhile, Dishonored on Very Hard really isn’t very hard at all once you’re used to how the game works. This may also have something to do with the fact that I’ve played all of those games at least once, but it’s still not that difficult.</p>
<p>Also, that signature thing is pretty cool. I’ll have to look at that.</p>

Words can’t describe my anger when my save got corrupted a couple months after I beat it.</p>
<p>Ignoring games where the difficultly can come from random chance and terrible controls, <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Holy Diver</span></span> on the Famicom is probably the hardest game I’ve ever played. If I were to quickly describe the game I’d call it Castlevania on steroids. It starts out slightly difficult in the first stage but its true nature isn’t revealed until the 3rd and 4th stage. You have a standard fireball attack which you can always use, though it’s usually a last resort. Your main weapons though are the 5 spells that you unlock one by one at the beginning of each stage. All the spells are extremely useful from stopping some enemies in their tracks, shots that pierce through foes, orbs that spin around you, and a screen clearing thunder blast. Despite the difficulty I’m having a lot of fun figuring out strategies for getting past tricky parts. I recommend giving it a try if you like action platformers.</p>
