    <description>Been absent since my first playthrough on release day. Decided to give the mod a second shot and I&#39;m still amazed by the quality of the game. I have no clue what&#39;s going on in development these days. Do this project have anything to do with the Steam release? Are there any news about it?</description>

<p>But we know they won’t. The first game on Source 2 was the Left 4 Dead 2 port (confirmed on linkedin long time ago) and the first public Source 2 thing is a Dota 2 Workshop Tool. There are also many rumours and leaks about Left 4 Dead 3.</p>

</aside>
<p>Much like Black Mesa in 2010, Valve had a totally complete Half Life three game some time ago but decided it did not meet the standards of their vision so whole parts had to be redone. That is why HL3 is taking longer than HL2  to finish</p>

<p>If it was just the same engine as all those other games, why would they need to keep it vague rather than just saying so? I’m not super well-informed about all of this, so don’t think much of this if you think the answer is obvious.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why do you assume we didn’t need to be vague about it? We have a very good reason for not being specific, but we wanted the community to know why so much work has been involved. That’s totally fair. We also immediately clarified that it was not Source 2 - but that rumour still gets spread around. No harm, no foul, it’s just a little silly. Good ol’ internet.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is not Source 2. It’s kind of an illogical conclusion to jump to, as well, really.</p>

<p>They’re moving to the 2013 engine &amp; Source 2 (With Source 2 being retail). Since you came out of the wood work and likely haven’t read <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=18848" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the rules</a>, I’ll let you know now: Questions like that don’t have a place to be asked on this blog. Not all the devs are networked with each other constantly. That being said, questions like that would be better suited for <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12508" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. The same general rule of thumb applies there as well; don’t expect an answer to your question.</p>

            <p>Been absent since my first playthrough on release day. Decided to give the mod a second shot and I’m still amazed by the quality of the game. I have no clue what’s going on in development these days. Do this project have anything to do with the Steam release? Are there any news about it?</p>
