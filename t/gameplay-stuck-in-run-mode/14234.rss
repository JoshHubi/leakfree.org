    <title>Gameplay stuck in run mode</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gameplay-stuck-in-run-mode/14234</link>
    <description>Hi.... new here so please be gentle ;o)

My game seems to be stuck in run mode like I had the shift key pressed... I reloaded previous game saves where I was able to walk and Freeman runs everywhere now.... I&#39;ve tried resetting the keybinding to default but this hasn&#39;t changed anything, Freeman still runs everywhere... what have I messed up?

Thanks in advance for any pointers to help me fix this!</description>

            <p>Go to Options &gt; Black Mesa  and uncheck “Always Run”</p>
<p>The option wasn’t working before, but the recent patch fixed it and in the process of doing so made it on-by-default for all players. Whoops. I guess Gordon didn’t want to be late to work again.</p>
