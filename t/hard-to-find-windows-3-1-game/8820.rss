    <title>Hard to Find Windows 3.1 Game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hard-to-find-windows-3-1-game/8820</link>
    <description>When I was 8 or 9 years old, my parents had a computer with Windows 3.1 on it, and there was a video game that I am 99% sure was called Streetball. 

Gameplay:

There was a ball that moved along these power beam sort of things. It would stay on the beam and move in one direction until it hit the wall, then it would bounce back (while staying on the beam). The only controls were the arrow keys, and when you pressed one, the ball would leave the power beam at a 45 degree angle. It would then bounce around until it hit another power beam, then it would latch on to that beam.

The purpose of the game was to maneuver the ball around each level to gather items such as keys, jewels, etc. and to unlock doors to get to the portal at the end of each level.

I realize this is a long shot, seeing how it seems like the average age of users on this forum is about 19 years old... But does anyone know anything about this game? Any and all attempts at searching Windows 3.1 forums, &quot;complete&quot; Windows 3.1 game lists, etc. have turned up with nothing. 

I can only remember two specific terms that MAY be helpful in jogging some memories (or searching):
Streetball (like I said, I&#39;m 99% sure this was the name of the game)
Brickyard (the name of one of the groups of levels)

Thanks in advance!</description>

<p>WOW. I just had a really strong feeling of nostalgia when you mentioned that xalener. I don’t know if we’re thinking of the same game, but I too remember playing a game like that too. It looked similar to Rise of the Robots which Vitriol mentioned, except the graphics were distinctly older. It was a very early polygon game, and I seem to remember that the robots had swords and crystals had something to do with the game, but I can’t remember what exactly. Man, I had completely forgotten about that game. Now I gotta go see if I can find it. I seem to remember it had a rotating camera, so it wasn’t fixed back and forth like Street Fighter, but was more like Soul Calibur, except I think you could even look behind your character at your opponent.</p>

<p>I think I finally found it. I’m pretty sure it was Beast Wars: Transformers. Used to play it in the computer labs back in middle school I think.</p>

<p>while we’re doing this, there was an old PC 3d robot fighting game. It was presented kinda like virtua fighter, except the fighters were robots or some shit. When I was about 5 (this was in 96- 98 ), I would visit my friend’s house and he’d always be playing it and he’d never let me play. Does the general description of the game itself ring any bells?</p>

            <p>I’ll hop on this wondering if anybody knows of a game I loved - there was this taxi that just kept moving forward, and you had to quickly slide pieces of the road so it would reach its goal without falling into the gaps. You know, like those annoying <a href="https://cdn2.staztic.com/screenshots/panda-puzzle-37-1.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">sliding puzzle games</a>. I’ve looked for it for AGES! Does it ring a bell?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  It’s like <a href="https://www.juegos.org.mx/5691-slide-roadway.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>, but way cooler.</p>

<p>WOW. I just had a really strong feeling of nostalgia when you mentioned that xalener. I don’t know if we’re thinking of the same game, but I too remember playing a game like that too. It looked similar to Rise of the Robots which Vitriol mentioned, except the graphics were distinctly older. It was a very early polygon game, and I seem to remember that the robots had swords and crystals had something to do with the game, but I can’t remember what exactly. Man, I had completely forgotten about that game. Now I gotta go see if I can find it. I seem to remember it had a rotating camera, so it wasn’t fixed back and forth like Street Fighter, but was more like Soul Calibur, except I think you could even look behind your character at your opponent.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>When I was 8 or 9 years old, my parents had a computer with Windows 3.1 on it, and there was a video game that I am 99% sure was called Streetball.</p>
<p>Gameplay:</p>
<p>There was a ball that moved along these power beam sort of things. It would stay on the beam and move in one direction until it hit the wall, then it would bounce back (while staying on the beam). The only controls were the arrow keys, and when you pressed one, the ball would leave the power beam at a 45 degree angle. It would then bounce around until it hit another power beam, then it would latch on to that beam.</p>
<p>The purpose of the game was to maneuver the ball around each level to gather items such as keys, jewels, etc. and to unlock doors to get to the portal at the end of each level.</p>
<p>I realize this is a long shot, seeing how it seems like the average age of users on this forum is about 19 years old… But does anyone know anything about this game? Any and all attempts at searching Windows 3.1 forums, “complete” Windows 3.1 game lists, etc. have turned up with nothing.</p>
<p>I can only remember two specific terms that MAY be helpful in jogging some memories (or searching):<br>
Streetball (like I said, I’m 99% sure this was the name of the game)<br>
Brickyard (the name of one of the groups of levels)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
