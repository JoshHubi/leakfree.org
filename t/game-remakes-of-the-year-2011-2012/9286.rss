<blockquote>
<p>Metal Gear: Remake the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 from the ground up in 3D as one game, using MGS4’s over the shoulder perspective. Full voice over for the cast, with all returning members of the Solid cast that are in the game, such as David Hayter, Paul Eding, and most importantly Greg Eagles as Grey Fox instead of Rob Paulsen. Change story to be consistent with all current MGS retcons as stipulated in the MGS4 Database as well as the stories of the most recent games in the franchise. Snake has CQC, but after the events of the Metal Gear 1 portion of the story, have him begin his self-imposed ban on CQC to make the second part of the game harder.</p>
<p>Metal Gear 1: Include a mix of the ocean landing and the jungle approach from both the MSX2 and the NES Metal Gear versions. Include LTL weapons to compliment the game’s originally lethal arsenal. Include one other operative dropped in with Snake, who is killed early on in a manner similar to Sam Fisher’s partner in Iceland in Splinter Cell: Double Agent. If Metal Gear ZEKE is not destroyed in the events of “Ground Zeroes,” replace the TX-55 Metal Gear with Zeke. If the player has a save file of Peace Walker on the PS3 or 360’s hard drive, import the color settings and armaments the player mounted in the game, to twist the knife on the player for playing the prequels in a satisfyingly meta way.</p>
<p>Metal Gear 2: Include LTL weapons to compliment the game’s lethal arsenal. Rework the plotline to fit in with nuclear weapons continuing to exist in the story’s timeframe. Make sure the manual has the fucking tap codes this time. Make this combined game kill off any possible continuation of the franchise, freeing up Kojima to develop new intellectual property.</p>
<p>Front Mission 5: Scars of the War- Remake in HD, translate and release in North America and Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While I think metal gear remakes would be cool, I really enjoy the originals as they are. I’m not of the opinion, however, that they should end the series once and for all. As far as storyline goes, going over the top has always worked for Metal Gear games. Expanding the storyline, however ridiculous the additions may seem, will add more hours of quality stealth gameplay to the series. The only Metal Gear I think should never be made is Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. I WANT that game to fail horribly so Hideo Kojima realizes that Metal Gear should always be about stealth gameplay.</p>
<p>Also, while Front Mission 5 could benefit from graphical updating, the story would be butchered in any sort of official localization. The fan translation is already better than Front Mission 3 and 4. What I’d like to see is a re-translation of Front Mission 3 and 4 whenever the Front Mission 2 and Front Mission: Alternative fan localizations are finished.</p>

            <p>Star Wars: Podracer, and Star Wars: Droidworks. I loved those two games as a kid. Podracer actually holds up alright these days, if you can get your PC to run it. It doesn’t like new computers <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>But yeah, I want to see podracers crashing and exploding on a modern engine. In the case of Droidworks, it was a really cool premise for a game, and a lot of neat features, but some stuff…Just didn’t work well. Plus it doesn’t like new computers either.</p>

            <p>I played Aleph One’s Marathon port. I don’t really see the point of a remake, honestly. The levels were pretty large but confusing due to the low texture detail. It just felt like running through endless tunnels with the occasional burst of gunfire to liven things up. Bungie should persue new IP.</p>
<p>Fuck, the whole <span class="bbcode-i">industry</span> needs new IP. At least I have Watch_Dogs to look forward to.</p>

<p>Have you not heard of Aleph One? Even since Bungie released the Marathon 2 source code, there has been an open source engine that runs all three Marathon games on Mac, Windows, and Linux with the option to replace textures with higher-res ones and to replace the original music with remastered remakes. Due to the engine open source, you can pretty much bring the absolute best out of Marathon. Even works with a lot of those famed Marathon total-conversions.</p>

<p>So I’ve heard! I’m really excited to see what they do with that, but of course, it’s hard to live up to such an insanely epic sci-fi trilogy.</p>
<p>And that small part of me will always want a remake of the original. I tried to assemble a team for a source remake when I was thirteen, but I had no idea what a difficult task it was, and didn’t really get far with it.</p>

<p>Deus Ex 1 with Human Revolution game mechanics and full graphical overhaul. Story mostly the same, but additions are made to fit better with Human Revolution’s story arc, and the ending the player chose in HR should carry over to Deus Ex in terms of the consequences from it. Get the original cast back to re-record their lines with the better audio quality expected of the remake.</p>

<p>The other mistake was putting it on Gamecube, because the face buttons don’t have pressure sensitivity like the PS2’s, so once you aim a weapon, you either fire it or you have to put it away with the inventory button, which is clunky as fuck.</p>

<p>The Y button.  Hold it before pushing A to pull out the FAMAS without firing, push it and let go of A to not fire the SOCOM, etc.</p>
