    <title>Need help with a collaboration comic</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-help-with-a-collaboration-comic/1013</link>
    <description>If anyone is skilled with Gmod and photoshop and makes super poses and edits but can&#39;t think of a storyline or script, you&#39;re in luck!!  And maybe I am too.

I&#39;ve been fleshing out the story for an epic Gmod comic for years now, titled B1NARY.  Problem is, in those years my skills in photoshop and Gmod have not increased one bit. =(

That&#39;s where you come in.  Post a short comic or even a screenshot that displays excellence in editing and posing, and you&#39;ve got the position.  As this is a collaboration comic, you get the credit for posing and editing.  All I ask is for credit in regards to the storyline.

Oh, and I need an easy way of contacting you to discuss plot events.

And I also ask Raw Bean to lock this when I have found that special someone.

This is in no way a method of extracting slave labor...I just want my story out there.</description>

            <p>You’re my man, then.  I trust your skills in Gmod and PS and, truth be told, I was kinda hoping you’d drop by to offer your skills.</p>

            <p>I’m well-versed in and actually certified in the use of Photoshop; but I’ve only fiddled around in Gmod from time to time - sorry.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
