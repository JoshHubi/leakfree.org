    <title>Brian&#39;s Black Mesa Improvement Project: part 1</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/brians-black-mesa-improvement-project-part-1/13043</link>
    <description>Ok guys were are going to try something new. We have this nice developer update section that has never seen an update. That is going to change. Before we get into what I&#39;m going to show let me lay some ground rules. This blog hopefully will be on going about every week to 2 weeks. What I am going to show is very recent stuff that is in game. It is ONLY to show what I am working on personally. Work is going on by other team members to make the MP maps and balance that game play, textures are being added and tweaked and lots of code work is being done. Please don&#39;t ask about that stuff. It won&#39;t be answered and will probably get the thread locked and the blog stopped. This is to talk about what I am doing and nothing else.

My name is Brian and I&#39;ve been on the team since 2004....from the beginning. I started off doing concept art (the apache and M1 drawings are mine and the artwork published in PC Gamer of ST was mine) and moved on to environmental textures (all the rock textures) and props textures (consoles to name a few). Now I basically do lots of things modeling, textures what ever needs doing. The last year or so of development I spent improving old models and textures plus finishing off things that got added. I redid all the military vehicle textures and remodeled some of them (m35, HUMVEE). And as crazy as it sounds I ran out of time. You wound think with a 10 year dev cycle that wouldn&#39;t have happened but it did. I got to redo most of what I wanted to do. But there was a lot left that I wanted to redo.
That is where this comes in. I&#39;m calling it Brian&#39;s Black Mesa Improvement Project or BBMIP. Since we now have a bit more time to tweak and polish the SP side this blog will serve as a preview of what to expect in the retail version (art wise). All the improvements will only be in the retail version.

So since December I have completed 60+ models and they are in game. Most are to replace brush work allowing for more detail and AO to blend in that texture better. LDs started giving me things they wanted modeled and I found things I always wanted to change and it got a tad bit crazy.

So this first image is basically what I did as a test to see how my idea would work. In case you can&#39;t tell there are 5 new models in &quot;lab 2&quot;. The rest should show the progression through AM and the models that were added. The wall wires being the only prop that was just improved by adding more polys vs being redone from scratch. I hope you enjoy the images. Stay tuned for more.

            <p>i saw that warning : All the improvements will only be in the retail version.<br>
it is not very fair as bms team always said their mod will be and stay free …<br>
may be you should add that fact instead of part 1 in title and make it sticky .</p>
<p>you could ask to use the .rk and TextFAMGUY1 in your mod to make people have the best for their money . for models from valve games …i think you can use them without limit : no one else but valve or valve games mod makers use the source engine .</p>
<p>will your release be made with xen ?</p>

</aside>
<p>Um did you read the first post? I’m not anything like fake factory. This isn’t a stand alone mod of a mod, this is (mostly) stuff that will be in the PAID version. We don’t take models from anywhere except HL2 and most of those we replaced with our own. All that stuff is legally belongs to someone else.</p>

            <p>No, he’s a Black Mesa team member redoing/upgrading segments of Black Mesa for the Steam release. He isn’t in charge of maps, so no extensions on them from him, they can’t legally use anything from L4D, DoD, etc., and enemies introduced in HL2 won’t appear in Black Mesa.</p>

<p>Salk,  The original version of Black Mesa is a free download.  I “desperately” recommend you to download and play!  The graphics are phenomenal as is and it is the most exciting game to play.</p>

            <p>Apparently some people can’t spot the changes in the first picture (at least reading the FB posts which I usually never do) The changes are…the whole window frame work is now a model with AO and detail textures (1). All the lab cabinets are modeled with doors/drawers and handles, the fume hoods in the back have the cabinets modeled and the hl2 prop replaced  (3) and the over head fume hood is now a stainless steel model (1). Next update tomorrow night instead of Saturday because I’m working.</p>
