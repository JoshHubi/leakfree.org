    <title>CSM not working on 2017/2018 public beta</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/csm-not-working-on-2017-2018-public-beta/15323</link>
    <description>I finally found some time to check out the public beta! While the godrays (in- and outdoor) and the lensflare seems to be working just fine, the CSM doesn&#39;t work for me. I tried diffrent settings in the Advanced videos options, but it didn&#39;t do anything. I am guessing it is graphics card related, as I have an AMD card and the same issue came up, when CSM was first introduced in 2016. It could be solved back then by setting &quot;-force_vendor_id 0x10DE -force_device_id 0x1180 -dxlevel 95&quot; in the launch options, but this doesn&#39;t seem to work this time around. Anyway here are some pics and my specs. Hope there will be a solution for it, as the game looks awesome in the pics!

DELL Inspiron 15r se
Intel Core i5-3210M CPU@ 2.50Ghz
16GB DDR
Switchable graphiccards:
INTEL HD Graphics 4000 &amp; AMD Radeon HD 7730M
