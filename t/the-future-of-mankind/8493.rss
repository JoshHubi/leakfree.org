I don&#39;t know if anyone has ever heard of the [b]Venus Project[/b], but I&#39;ve been following them and their advancements for some time. Recently, the [b]Venus Project[/b] team has received a rather large donation, which combined with previous donations, has reached a total of $113,856.00 dollars. This has sky rocketed their moral and advertising abilities -- I feel it&#39;s necessary to share this World-Changing system with as many forums and feeds as possible. The video I posted above is something they are making to show this world to the public - a sort of film/documentary. 

[i][FONT=&#39;Book Antiqua&#39;]&quot;The world needs to be ready to accept the [b]Venus Project[/SIZE][/b], otherwise it will all be for nothing.&quot;[/FONT] --[/i] [FONT=&#39;Book Antiqua&#39;][b]Jacque Fresco/ Project Leader[/b] - ex. Social Engineer and Industrial Designer.[/FONT]

[i]&quot;The [b]Venus Project[/b] advocates an alternative vision for a sustainable new world civilization unlike any socio-economic system that has gone before. It calls for a straightforward redesign of a culture, in which the age-old inadequacies of war, poverty, hunger, debt, and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable, but totally unacceptable.&quot;[/i] -- [FONT=&#39;Arial&#39;][b]Venus Project Official[/b][/FONT]

Please don&#39;t ask me anything about the project that is too complicated for me to efficiently answer; their entire site has plenty of videos that will answer any possible questions voiced.

[FONT=&#39;Arial&#39;]P.S: Before anyone tries to foolishly criticize the system represented here, please note that these people have worked for over 40 years on this and probably know more about the world your living in than you ever will -- no insult intended, just giving you a heads up. If you have questions that you can&#39;t find an answer to on their site, feel free to ask.[/SIZE][/FONT]</description>

            <p>Complete central planning has never worked and will never work, whenever the profit/loss system and the price system are abandoned you end up with massive shortages and/or surplusses. Under a completely centrally planned economy resources are never allocated efficiently. It’s no surprise that North Korea has one of the worst performing economies on Earth. Central planning is also the reason the Soviet Union collapsed. The financial interactions between the billions of people living on this planet cannot be centrally planned, not by computers and certainly not by a bureaucracy. You need money, profit/losses and above all: PRICES</p>
<p>The Venus Project has some good points, I particularly like their critique of statism, state collectivism, government granted banking monopolies (central banking) and fiat currencies. But I think their views on capitalism and free trade are flawed and certainly not new.</p>

            <p>A utopian society that looks good on paper but forgets that you have to count on peoples of different societies to make it work. You have to count on the entire population of the planet to agree on it. If humans wage war over things like which invisible sky daddy to believe in then how could you ever get them to agree on ideas like this?</p>
<p>Makes  a good sci-fi story but won’t work unless the population is very small and of one mind.</p>

            <p>Ah, Run Lola Run! Without a doubt one of the finest examples of modern German cinema, right up next to Das Leben Der Anderen! Love that film! Anyway, if you want my opinion, I think Lola was able to break glass with her voice in the same way Casper Van Dien has such an epic jawline: movie magic. The vast majority of film from any time period requires a certain suspension of disbelief to enjoy on an intellectual level, but Lola Rennt in particular. It’s not metaphorical, but figurative. When Lola runs downstairs, she is suddenly animated, with no explanation as to why. The movie takes us for a ride, you see. It doesn’t ask us to unlock a meaning. It simply shows us an unrealistic world, and asks us to accept it as fact.</p>

<p>I don’t know if anyone has ever heard of the <span class="bbcode-b">Venus Project</span>, but I’ve been following them and their advancements for some time. Recently, the <span class="bbcode-b">Venus Project</span> team has received a rather large donation, which combined with previous donations, has reached a total of $113,856.00 dollars. This has sky rocketed their moral and advertising abilities – I feel it’s necessary to share this World-Changing system with as many forums and feeds as possible. The video I posted above is something they are making to show this world to the public - a sort of film/documentary.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><font face="Book Antiqua">“The world needs to be ready to accept the <span class="bbcode-b">Venus Project[/SIZE]</span>, otherwise it will all be for nothing.”</font> –</span> <font face="Book Antiqua"><span class="bbcode-b">Jacque Fresco/ Project Leader</span> - ex. Social Engineer and Industrial Designer.</font></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“The <span class="bbcode-b">Venus Project</span> advocates an alternative vision for a sustainable new world civilization unlike any socio-economic system that has gone before. It calls for a straightforward redesign of a culture, in which the age-old inadequacies of war, poverty, hunger, debt, and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable, but totally unacceptable.”</span> – <font face="Arial"><span class="bbcode-b">Venus Project Official</span></font></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thevenusproject.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.thevenusproject.com/</a></p>
<p>Please don’t ask me anything about the project that is too complicated for me to efficiently answer; their entire site has plenty of videos that will answer any possible questions voiced.</p>
<p><font face="Arial">P.S: Before anyone tries to foolishly criticize the system represented here, please note that these people have worked for over 40 years on this and probably know more about the world your living in than you ever will – no insult intended, just giving you a heads up. If you have questions that you can’t find an answer to on their site, feel free to ask.[/SIZE]</font></p>
