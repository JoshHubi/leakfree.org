    <title>Doc&#39;s Wireless PS1 Controllers- No Signal</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/docs-wireless-ps1-controllers-no-signal/9058</link>
    <description>So I just got 2 Doc&#39;s wireless controllers for the original Playstation, the guy selling them said they were tested and working. I pop 2 AAA batteries in and switch the toggle from &#39;Off&#39; to &#39;1P.&#39; The red light on the controller lights up, as does the light on the receiver. Yet there is no response from the system. I&#39;ve tried multiple games, multiple sets of batteries, multiple angles and distances from the sensor, 1P and 2P, with and without a memory card, and both controllers. Same deal.

So I plug in my old wired controller that doesn&#39;t reach back to the couch, and voila. The buttons start working again.

I&#39;m using one of the original Playstations (before the PSOne redesign) which, according to everything I&#39;ve read, should work just fine. The only documentation I&#39;ve found for these things is a diagram that shows the position of the different buttons. No syncing instructions, and there are no buttons or compartments on the receiver whatsoever.

Any ideas?

P.S. I know this is a wild stab in the dark since Half-Life/Black Mesa have nothing to do with PS1, but figured someone must know more about troubleshooting wireless hardware than I do. Plus this is like the only forum I ever visit.</description>

            <p>Thanks. I’ll look into that.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Edit: Well, couldn’t get them to work at all on an original Playstation but they worked a treat on the PSOne. Same as the pair I got to replace them. Weird. Also turns out the wireless PS2 controllers worked on the original Playstation the whole time. Derp.</p>

<p>Some of the IR LED’s may be burnt out or damaged and in need of resoldering, which is an easy fix if you’ve got a Radio Shack nearby. Try testing them out on a PS2 or PS1 with controller ports you know work to be sure as well.</p>
