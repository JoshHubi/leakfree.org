<p>It was pretty hard not paying attention to them when they filled the entire forum in new threads every 5min.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I just had to re-confirm my email, so I dunno if that’s something the mods have put in place to deter throwaways, someone tried to access my account, or just a hiccup in the login system.<br>
Hopefully they’ll get this under control soon.</p>

            <p>I thought this issue was fixed back in December, guess i was wrong.</p>
<p>EDIT: i made a dummy account under the username TestDummy a few days ago. You don’t need a steam account now.</p>
<p>For a while after Decembers spam attack i think some users, including myself, had to have a steam account to even log in.</p>
<p>This needs to be fixed, its getting ridiculous.</p>
