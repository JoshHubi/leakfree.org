    <description>My problem is as follows: Source SDK Base 2007 is over 4GB big, &amp; I would like to know if there exists a seperate off-line installer (outside the steam interface) that I can download from my office PC where I have an uncapped internet connection, &amp; then transfer to my home PC where I have limited internet access.</description>

            <p>Thanks guys, Valve tech support confirms that you can simply copy the SDK Base 2007 files onto an external &amp; into a fresh Steam installation on another PC. Will post if I have trouble.</p>

<p>If you have a DVD installation of HL2, HL2:Ep1 and HL2:Ep2 you can install those and Steam will grab a lot of content from there, which reduces the download time on Source SDK Base. Although, since the DVD releases, Valve has overhauled the engine and SDK structure a few times, so it will always be a download of considerable size.</p>
<p>As an alternative, you can download Source SDK Base 2007 and then burn the folder to a DVD / copy it to an external drive. Then manually copy it back into your other pc’s Steam folder. As far as I know, Steam checks which files already exists, so you should be good using that method. If you give it a shot, let me know if it actually works  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>You’d have to get Steam on your office computer, but if you right click Source SDK Base 2007 in the tools menu once you’ve installed it, and click Backup Game Files, Steam can make a compressed file with all the data you need to install it on another computer. It can even split the file into bits for burning onto CDs/DVDs.</p>
