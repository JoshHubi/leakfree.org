    <title>Upgrading my friend&#39;s PC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/upgrading-my-friends-pc/8004</link>
    <description>So my friend is upgrading his PC.

He&#39;s probably getting i7-2600 3.4Ghz and 8GB 1600MHz RAM.

So my question is, what gpu and what motherboard does he need? And how much watt? Brand for the power supply?

Thanks

oh yeah, budget all-inclusive is around 4-500€ ideally
oh, and maybe it&#39;s better to get an i5 instead of an i7?

Edit: All I really need to know is, with a budget of ~€500:
-Is it worth investing in i7, or will i5 do?
-RAM has already been decided.
-Should he go with nVidia or ATI?
-Which gpu of either brand is high-end but still not all that expensive? (~€150 ideally)
-Which motherboard is compatible with these parts, and is of a decent quality? (~€60-100)
-How much power will this need?</description>

<p>Exactly. And to be honest, I appreciate the size-- I don’t have a hard drive attached to my system yet (can’t buy one because the flood in Thailand made the prices jump 2x-3x), yet I’ve managed to install all the programs and games I play with ~ 30 gigs to spare. Sure, I won’t be torrenting too much now, but I’m not complaining.</p>
<p>And I still find it incredibly entertaining to open folders on the hard disk instantaneously. No spinning up-- it’s just there. Puts a smile on my face every time.</p>
<p>P.S. I was pleasantly surprised to see Crysis 1 run totally smoothly maxed out at 1920x1200 (with no AA, which IMO is unnecessary at that resolution) with a single GTX 560 ti. I’m sure the processor plays a major part in that as my old alienware’s i7 860 and ati 5870 didn’t play it nearly as well at 1080p.</p>

<p>Good to hear that you can play Crysis 1 maxed smoothly, that means you’re pretty much ready for everything else you can throw at it</p>

            <p>I didn’t have any problem playing it on my 5870 besides it not playing at 60 FPS on maximum. Also it crashed on the last boss in DX10 mode but I don’t think that was because of my card.</p>

            <p>Well my point at the SSD was you wouldn’t need one that’s 120 GB. 60-80 is all you’d need for your OS + system updates, and would be considerably cheaper, but as he got it on craigslist, there wasn’t much he could do about its size.</p>

            <p>I don’t think the SSD was a bad idea, I have one in my macbook pro and it makes a huge difference. Way better than my raptor in my PC, although that drive is pretty old school these days. And for 1K that’s a pretty damn good rig if I say so myself. Also, over-clocking is super overrated especially because of the added cost of a better cooler and the risk of hardware failure, and even more especially since 90% of games are GPU bound. I mean, my four year old dual core E6850 3.0GHz still runs literally every game on the market at max settings at 1080P as long as I don’t use AA. I’m not a 60FPS snob so I can handle a game running at 30FPS as well.</p>

<p>Ah. Regardless, my point was that the i7 WAS “smart shopping”, on the contrary to what you said, simply because I got it (plus a hell of a lot of other amazing hardware) for much less than I could build a “smart” system with a smaller SSD/hard drive + an i5.</p>

</aside>
<p>…the i5 and i7 have the same socket type.  You can use either on the same motherboard.  Also, the i5 is not going to become obsolete for quite some time.  Ivy Bridge might have a new socket when it comes out, but again, Sandy Bridge is not going obsolete any time soon.</p>

            <p>Apparently you’re one of those retards who missed the fact that I got that system on Craigslist. Obviously I would’ve used a smaller SSD, a different case, an i5 2500k, less RAM, different video card, etc. if I was building it myself. But I wasn’t. And I got a superior system for much less than you could build any “smart” system, especially when you take into account the $400+ worth IPS display I got with it.</p>

            <p>Yeah but the i5-2500k overclocked to its fullest potential would probably last you a few years, negating that. Unless you’re one of those retards who likes to just throw money around just because you have too much disposable income.</p>

            <p>I paid $1000 even for the following just last weekend:<br>
Asus Sabertooth P67 motherboard with an i7 2600k and 8gb 1600mhz memory, as well as a GTX 560 ti and an intel 120gb sata iii SSD, powered by a Corsair TX750 psu, all in a Corsair 600t case (plus a Dell U2410 24" 1920x1200 IPS display and a backlit keyboard + Logitech gaming mouse)</p>
<p>My point is you don’t need to spend insane amounts of money for insane hardware. It’s about smart shopping. I got the above setup on Craigslist, an hour after selling my old POS alienware for $1250.</p>

<p>I don’t think you looked at my link, which shows you that an 800 dollar rig can run BF3 maxed out. My 4 year old rig (with a newer gtx 275) can run BF3 maxed out at 1080P at 30fps. 1600 is overkill these days man. Don’t add fuel to the console haters’ fires.</p>

<p>Does this seem like a good setup (€583.78):<br>

<p>You NEED to spend about a thousand and a half to play latest games that require intense amount of processing power maxed out with a decent fps enough to be enjoyable and smooth.</p>
<p>Look at me, I spent 1600 on mine, and metro2033 still runs at 40fps maxed out.</p>

<p>I had this running while I was playing some WoW, and my 470 maxed out at 93 C, and seemed to average in the high 80s.</p>
<p>I will leave it running while I sleep to get a decent idle temp, and play a real game tomorrow and see how high the temps go.</p>

            <p>I just saw an article today about building a pc for battlefield 3. It’s a great article that shows you how bogus the belief is that you NEED to spend thousands to play the latest games. It’s bogus because consoles are holding back graphics anyway so any decent rig can play just about every game on the highest settings. I know you’re going with intel but this article might still be of interest to you. And I think the Nvidia ATI debate is just fanboyism. I’ve always had Nvidia and they’ve served me well. I can say the same about my friends who’ve had ATI also. In all my gaming history I would say that I’ve HEARD more issues happening with ATI and their drivers, but I really have yet to see many issues with either companies’ products. The only game-crippling bug I’ve seen is with my GTX 275 in Crysis near concrete buildings with shadows set above low. Nvidia acknowledged this problem with specific 200-series cards but never fixed it. Anyway here’s the article: <a href="https://videogamewriters.com/how-to-build-a-battlefield-3-ready-gaming-rig-for-under-800-27454" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://videogamewriters.com/how-to-build-a-battlefield-3-ready-gaming-rig-for-under-800-27454</a></p>

<p>So my friend is upgrading his PC.</p>
<p>He’s probably getting i7-2600 3.4Ghz and 8GB 1600MHz RAM.</p>
<p>So my question is, what gpu and what motherboard does he need? And how much watt? Brand for the power supply?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The latest Intel Core i-series chips are socket LGA-1155.  The most popular line of motherboards with this socket type are the ASUS P8P67 boards.  I have an ASUS P8P67 Pro, and it’s been working marvelously for me.</p>
<p>If your friend insists on getting an i7 (as opposed to an i5, which should serve him just fine), then he should probably spring an extra thirty bucks to get the 2600K (as opposed to just the 2600).  That way, it’s unlockable for overclocking further down the line if he needs more performance in the future.</p>
<p>8GB 1600MHz RAM is a good amount at a good clock speed.  Just make sure - and this is IMPORTANT - that whatever memory he buys is rated for 1.5 Volts.  Memory rated at 1.67 Volts does NOT play nicely with the Intel Core i-series chips.  I use Corsair Vengeance memory.  G.Skill is also a really popular brand with gamers right now.</p>
<p>I would decide the wattage for the power supply based on the video card’s specs.  I have an nVidia GTX 580, for which the minimum spec is 600 Watts, so I got a 650 Watt power supply.  Generally, builders-of-their-own-PCs are adivsed to go with PSUs from a trusted brand, and not some generic brand.  My PSU is a Corsair Enthusiast series.</p>
<p>As for the GPU, some prefer nVidia, some prefer ATI/AMD.  I happen to prefer nVidia.  Don’t try to save money on a graphics card by getting a GTX 400-series card (they have heating and power-draw issues) or a “recertified” card.  If you go with nVidia, go with a GTX 500-series.  The 550 is a great budget card, the 560 is awesome bang for the buck if you’re willing to shell out, and if you can afford it, the GTX 580 is godmode.  There’s also a GTX 590, but you should only consider it if you’re going to game on an HDTV with enormous native resolution.  As for manufacturers: the two big companies (ATI and nVidia) license their technology to third-party manufactures, so that you see their brand name on the card.  My GTX 580 is manufactured by EVGA; they’re very popular for their good customer service and excellent warranties.  ASUS and Sapphire are also good card manufacturers, from what I’ve heard.</p>
