    <title>New Headset for Gaming</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-headset-for-gaming/5990</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I am looking to buy myself a new headest for gaming, since the one i have is dead, and was crap when i had it. I am looking currently at the Logitech G930, and looking for other people&#39;s opinion. Most of the reviews online say its awesome, but I want your opinion. If you have any others that you think are better, please post a link. Keep the price under $200 if possible  :slight_smile:  thanks :pirate:</description>

            <p>Tritton AX pro.<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826235005&amp;cm_re=tritton_ax_pro--26-235-005--Product" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826235005&amp;cm_re=tritton_ax_pro-<em>-26-235-005-</em>-Product</a></p>
<p>Best headset i’ve ever used. It’s not simulated surround sound, there are dedicated speakers for front, center etc. that make it real surround.</p>

            <p>Eh, my $70 Razer Characarias does the trick just fine. Great stereo sound and comfortable as holy hell. The mic is pretty decent too.</p>
<p>“Surround” headphones don’t do much for me.</p>

            <p>Pricey, but I’d recommend G35’s too</p>

            <p>Logitech G35 is really nice, I got it on an open box deal from Newegg for like 80. 7.1 Surround, noise cancelling, voice morphing, good sound quality and really durable! I love them.</p>

            <p>Plantronic headsets are usually good. I got a Gamecom model which is really good quality and cost about 50€.</p>
