This is really annoying, I can&#39;t manage to jump through broken windows, on to desks, over a small waste paper basket etc. It&#39;s killing the mood dude!</description>

            <p>The jump system in BM really sucks.  I have been going back and forth between HL and BM, and HL is really easy.  Maybe too easy.  I can always jump onto and over the laser mines.  Can’t do that at all in BM.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to do this, but now I feel like explaining my situation.<br>
I used to be ambidextrous.  In fact my left hand was stronger than my right hand.  Then I got into a moptorcycle accident in 1979 that left my left hand half numb.  I wuz 48 when HL came out in 1998 and had no trouble jumping then or now.  I have not had any problems in any game I have played since.  BM is unique in its demand that one must do a tap dance on the keyboard in order to play this mod.<br>
That   aint   happnin  kid.</p>

            <p>You must really suck. Sounds like you have a lot more experience playing HL than me, yet you have way more trouble using BM’s jump system? It really isn’t that difficult. You don’t need to press four buttons at once. All you need to do is press crouch when you’re <span class="bbcode-i">already in the air</span>.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I wish they would have kept the movement/jump mechanics the same as in HL2, but it’s really not that big of an issue.</p>

            <p>Tried binding different buttons but it didn’t work out.  Reread this thread and found some help.<br>
The idea of Zen.SS.SharpShooter in post <span class="hashtag">#38</span> on autoexec.cfg settings is a huge help.  It cuts the number of buttons needed from 4 to 2 or 3.  Much much better.<br>
Then I tried the idea of Xalener in post <span class="hashtag">#44</span> about playing with the skill.cfg.  Bumping the 3 jump parameters up 20 is another help.<br>
It is a whole new game now and very nice.</p>

<p>I have been playin HL1 for 14 years.  My last complete playthrough on hard was last July.  I have no problem with jumping in HL but BM is a major pain. Most jumps require 4 buttons to be pushed, which I have problems doing.  I am now finishing my 6th playthrough of BM and am getting better, but jumping still feels just plain wrong.</p>

<p>Hahahaha, so funny.<br>
In another video he gives an explaination for all this, he just basically says : thank you haters, you gave me more views, so i got more money.<br>
I also thought this was some 14 year old kid that only played COD and such, but it turns out to be an 30 years old guy that played Quake, Unreal and all those kind of games.<br>
Anyways, back on topic.<br>
I never had any problem with crouch jumping, even in this game.<br>
After all these years playing source games, i became used to it, so no i don’t think it was overused.<br>
I only realised this after i read all the complains about the jump mechanics, but i can understand that if some new players or gamers that have just been introduced to this awesome, can think this crouchjumping is troublesome or annoying.</p>

            <p>Do you know that bridge on the cliff with 2 jumps required?  When you miss the jump you land by that helicopter that you just shot down.  I have landed ON that chopper more than I have completed those jumps.  I saved there when I finally made it and use that save every time now.  On 6th play through with this very clumsy control system.</p>

            <p>I do not want to play BM running around like a demented squirrel on crack, so play with always run off.<br>
That means I have to push 4 buttons in a certain sequence with my left hand in order to make any jump.<br>
IMO this is a game breaker.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s just me, but HL1 was the first game that I remember ever using the crouch jump a lot, and as such it has become second nature for me to crouch jump everywhere, just because it is easier. I really don’t know if that’s just me tho.</p>

<p>IMO, crouch-jump is something realistic movement ever made in video game. Hey, imagine yourself jumping over a 3-feet table. Are you going to bend your legs (in this case, crouching) or just simply jump with your legs pointing straight toward ground? Be realistic people, get used to it. This is not COD. I believe most people complaining about a crouch-jumping never play Half-Life before, am I right?</p>

            <p>I don’t mind crouch jumping, but it is just ridiculous how much it’s done in Black Mesa. I mean, I can’t get over an ankle-high tripmine or wall without crouch jumping.</p>
<p>Then I look at it from my brother’s POV who doesn’t play Half-Life as much as me. He dislikes the crouch jumping. He says he doesn’t always know whether the jump requires a normal hop, a crouch jump, a sprinting run, or a sprinting run crouch jump. And seeing how he doesn’t quicksave every 5 seconds, sometimes he’ll get through a difficult event and then die because he jumped slightly wrong. Then he has to do the event all over again. It seems kinda unfair how the game expects you to do these crazy button combos more often than in Half-Life 1 <span class="bbcode-i">or</span> 2. I love Black Mesa but I have to agree with him when he says there’s a reason most non-valve games don’t have crouch jumping.</p>

            <p>I’ve always enjoied crouch jumping as a feature.  I always crouch jump in HL2 (where I’m pretty sure there are some secret areas you can only access by crouching). Anyway personally it makes things easier for me, but I guess that’s just personal.</p>
<p>It’s also not really “unfair” because you can crouch mid air to the same effect, so you don’t need to hold down sprint and crouch at the same time.</p>

            <p>Am I the only person who used crouch jumps in HL2? They’re super handy for getting over the top of walls, getting through windowsills, clambering up crates, and other such things.</p>
<p>Also, has anyone captured from original HL to compare to both HL2 and BM?</p>

            <p>^ What jezMM said.</p>
<p>I don’t have a ‘problem’ with it per say, but I think jumps that aren’t special in some way (noticeably higher/farther than usual) should be one button.</p>
<p>I also played HL2/E1/E2 and Portal/Portal 2 first, jumping felt WEIRD in BM.<br>
Edited config, problem solved.</p>
<p>Btw, I still LOVE this game, having a blast.</p>
<p>P.S. Dr. Tub BM:QWOP needs to actually happen! :3 (maybe an… …abstract take on the hazard course?)</p>

            <p>As someone who played Half-Life 2 first, and at the late time of The Orange Box no less, I do find the crouch-jump weirdly unnatural.  I’ve never liked it really, as the idea that my character is tuck jumping into vents looks completely ridiculous in my mind’s eye.  I guess it’s a technique that sort of “emulates” what in real life would be pulling yourself up onto stuff with your arms, but… yeah it’s weird, and I don’t see why people defend it as a necessary component of challenge to the game.  I mean do you honestly think the game is “harder” for including it, and if so, that is somehow a good thing?</p>
<p>I also don’t get what all these people saying “Source games have always used it” are talking about.  I play Half-Life 2, Episode One, Episode Two, Portal, Portal 2, Left 4 Dead, and Left 4 Dead 2, and I don’t think the latter three even allow crouch jumping.  HL2, the episodes, and Portal never require crouch-jumping once, and I don’t recall ever feeling the allowing my entry onto higher objects with only one keystroke was ever patronising or somehow needed an extra feeling of control.</p>
<p>Considering the game used the HL2 style rolling/throwing for grenades, I don’t think it would be tarnishing the original game to update the movement to feel like Half-Life 2.</p>
<p>To be honest as someone who adores Half-Life 2 but could never get into the original game going back (the things that define the Half-Life series for me are the physics play and memorable characters, both things the original lacked, despite being groundbreaking in its own way at the time), I always saw Black Mesa as basically bringing the original up to HL2’s standards, so the presence of an age-old technique such as crouch-jumping felt really strange to me.  Granted, I’m not the only target audience here, well aware of that, just saying.</p>
<p>Honestly I think the ideal solution would be to have some sort of options screen item that activates/de-activates a script that auto-crouch jumps at the points where it is necessary to progress through the game.  That way HL1 veterans can keep their manual crouch-jumping if they want, and those who were introduced to the series in HL2 have the option of keeping the experience consistent.</p>
<p>Granted, I don’t know how difficult it would be to put in, but yeah.</p>

            <p>Just play with always run and it becomes much easier to crouch jump, but I’ll admit that it’s unfair for players who play without always run.</p>

<p>You jump about as high as Half life 2 actually. It’s just that your jumps don’t cause as many deaths in HL2 as in Black Mesa that you don’t notice it.</p>

<p>As those videos show, you don’t jump nearly as high <span class="bbcode-i">or</span> as far in BM as you do in HL2. I don’t really mind the jump mechanics in BM all that much, except for the fact that it’s wildly different than in HL2.</p>
<p>I don’t really get why they changed it. Jumping was fine in HL2. It also has crouch-jumping, anyway. If they wanted to put more focus on it, they should’ve just made obstacles a bit higher.</p>

            <p>The problem is that Valve (professionals in their business*) introduced crouchjumping for special occasions and special jumps.</p>
<p>And in BM it got reduced and simplified to press two buttons every time. There isn’t anything special about it anymore, no special gaps that need a special jump, which reduces the game to a non-HL-style-game with two buttons for jumping.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
THe only good thing about it is, that it gives a few people the opportunity to feel superior by telling others “learn to push two buttons” ignoring that these others managed it perfectly fine. It also reveals how short-sightened it is to say that pressing two buttons for crouch-jumping is unique for the HL series. It is unique that the HL games offer special jumps that require crouch jumping, no matter how many buttons you press.</p>
<p>*) I am not saying that BM isn’t (close to) professional quality. But it has some game design flaws that still make it a mod besides all technical quality and the awesome mod they created overall.</p>

            <p>Yeah me too, but I usually crouch jump only when I can, and when I’m in Gordon Freeman mode.</p>

            <p>I definitely seem to recall being able to jump higher/farther in vanilla Half-Life 1 and Half-Life: Source, but perhaps I am not remembering correctly. But yes, in the old versions of ‘Black Mesa’ you had to manually crouch while jumping to raise your legs.</p>
<p>During my playthrough I at first found it a funny feature bringing you back to the olden times of Half-Life, but after my left hand started hurting after a good bunch of levels (played through them like mad, and loved it!) I really preferred not having to crouch while jumping.</p>
<p>So (shameless plug) I messed around with a few keybind aliases and came up with the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=13723" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=13723</a></p>
<p>It’s a small tweak set adding some extra (and optional) controls to the bottom of the keyboard options menu that allow you to toggle duck and perform automatic duck jumps, and a few other keybinds (some of them considered cheats).</p>
<p>Try them out if you like and drop a few replies with ideas for improvement. The keybinds are gathered in a separate ‘Sjakal’ category at the bottom of the keyboard options menu, and you can mix and match them with the original keybinds if you prefer manual duck jumping or sprinting and so on.</p>
