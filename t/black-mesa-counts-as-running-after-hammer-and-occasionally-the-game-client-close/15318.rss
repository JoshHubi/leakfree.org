    <title>Black Mesa counts as &quot;running&quot; after Hammer and occasionally the game client close</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-counts-as-running-after-hammer-and-occasionally-the-game-client-close/15318</link>
    <description>Often after closing Hammer, and occasionally after closing the game, Steam will continue to register Black Mesa as &quot;running&quot;, preventing BM and any other game from being launched until Steam is forcibly killed in the task manager.

As much as I would love to be able to claim I have over 800 hours logged in Black Mesa, at least half of that time is a result of this bug happening and me not noticing until later.</description>
