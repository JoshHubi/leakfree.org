    <title>A glitch a bug and a way to exploit the game [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-glitch-a-bug-and-a-way-to-exploit-the-game-fixed/11014</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had the chance to play the game yesterday at a friend&#39;s house, and trough my playtrough i&#39;ve only found two issues (and a bug which involves the first issue).

All of them are about elevators,but I swear it&#39;s pure coincidence (haha  :wink: ).

 1) The first one is that, at the begining of the game , at the descending elevator (Unforseen Consequences chapter i believe) which dozens of headcrabs are falling from a ramp. [b]On this elevator, it is possible to hide behind the elevator&#39;s fence and avoid all the headcrabs. It is also possible to &quot;surf&quot; trough the ramp aiming towards a safe jump at the end, and by doing so it is possible to avoid the whole falling headcrab sequence.[/b]

[b]The bug:[/b] If you stand on the edge/corner of the elevator (behind the fence) the elevator will eventually get closer to the plataform (near the bottom, the one with a door in it) and the player will get stuck, forever. That could have been avoided if the plataform was &quot;more of a far jump&quot;.  [It&#39;s a truly simple common bug in games, [b]it&#39;s one of those &quot;stuck by geometry&quot; bugs.[/b]] [The corner is the one at the right for the player who stand facing the ramp.]


2) I noticed a glitch (maybe a bug I wouldn&#39;t know the difference); [b]If the player manage to[/b] kill an enemy inside an elevator, or by any other means [b]get a corpse inside an elvator[/b] (not all elevators do that), sometimes [b]the corpse falls trough the floor and sometimes[/b] when the elevator start moving (up/down) [b]the corpse gets shattered/smashed by the gibs system.[/b]. This only happened to me twice though. [b][The elevator must be moving for this to happen].[/b]

I&#39;ll report more if I find more.</description>
