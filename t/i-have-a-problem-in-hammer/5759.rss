    <description>yeah... I have a problem in hammer...

I&#39;m trying to make a skybox. I follow tutorials. The tutorials said that I need to make a huge brush that covers my whole map, so I did it. Next, the tuts said that I need to make it hollow but EVERYTIME I do, in any measurement, EVERYTHING INSIDE IT DISAPPEARS! they are still there but not visible. I mean it&#39;s like a graphical error. When i come close to entities like the spawn point, SOMETIMES I see just a part of it like legs only. What&#39;s the fix? I can&#39;t find one.

EDIT: I used another texture for the skybox. I used concrete or windows, it works properly even when hollowed. But when I use a skybox texture, the brushes becomes transparent to the skybox texture but not the concrete texture. help?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I thought it was unneccesary to create a new thread for my question/problem, so I just write it into this one. I’m working on a map for Counter-Strike: Source for a few months now, it is about to be finished but I have a problem that I must solve or I can’t release it. When I look at a certain place of the map the fps rate gets low but I don’t know exactly why. It’s an abandoned supermarket with empty shelves, a few bottle props and cans but not too much, and I put some foodpile models from cs_militia in it so it looks like all that stuff has been dropped from the shelves. I also built a hole into a wall at the storage room that has been blown in. I didn’t just carve a hole into it but made it look like it was a real brick wall. But I don’t whether the props are the reason why the fps rate is low or the complex wall constructure pulls it down. I thought I ask someone who might know something about that before I make a copy of the map and test it by deleting the props and then compile the map.</p>
<p>Here’s the hole in the wall.<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>These are the shelves and the foodpile props, the shelves are converted into func_details.<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>And here are some bottles and cans.<br>

            <p>Did you turn the wall func_detail before cutting it?<br>
If so, either convert it into a non-entity world object or use the ‘Solids’ selection mode to select only the cut part.</p>

            <p>Now I have a problem with the Clipping tool.</p>
<p>I’m trying to make a door so I have to use the clipping tool. After I use the clipping tool, the box that I just cut is still attached to the wall. I can see lines that I already cut it but it still a part of the wall. It won’t separate. I tried moving, and deleting it but whatever happens to the wall or box that I just cut out happens to one another. It’s still whole. Help?</p>

<p>It’s only for fun. Besides, I’m still learning. It’s like training.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, forgot, I’m the only one in my school who knows about steam. My schoolmates are somewhat ignorant. They do know some valve games like L4D but they don’t know who made the game. So… they are somewhat impressed with what I’m doing even though it’s not something to be impressed. It’s a school’s first in my school.</p>

I’m gonna put a headcrab on top of my principal. Of course the face can’t be seen, since it’s covered by the headcrab, so the model doesn’t really matter much.</p>

            <p>I recommend not using the “hollow” tool by the way. Can get really messy. Just create a brush and shift + drag to clone it a few times. Much more controllable that way.</p>

            <p>I don’t know if this would fix your issue. But hammer has settings to show models and objects how ever far from the camera. You can go into hammer settings under tools, I believe. Then go under 3D views. You can set how far you want the objects in hammer to show up for you. Your computer might have set the settings with a small point of view so your program won’t crash. You can change it if you want to have a larger view point.</p>
<p>^Might not be your solution but sounds like you can see them until your close because your computer isn’t trying to focus on showing that object but it’s not close enough. Hope that helps  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Well, you need to make big square, that will cover whole map. Then you need to choose material. Type “skybox” in material search and scroll down to the bottom. There should be blue material named “skybox”. Apply it. Then right click on your skybox, make hollow, and type -32. It should work, because it work for me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">   Sorry about my English.</p>
