            <p>the worst that can happen is the HDD firmware gets wiped, you can do the same for the RAM and other components, but you need a massive collection of drivers and most virus makers just want a backdoor into the system to use it as a proxy for other e-crimes or to sell it for someone to use it in that effect</p>
<p>if you’re accused of piracy just tell them you have viruses</p>
