    <title>Help With Recording Comparison Footage</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-with-recording-comparison-footage/14116</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing the original GoldSrc games for some time now and I just got to Half-Life. There is a strong difference between this game and the original and I want to record footage to clearly convey how I believe Black Mesa is holding itself back. Does anyone have any suggestions for recording software? I&#39;ve got a 1080p monitor but I don&#39;t want to record the entire screen, just 720p in a 720p-sized window.</description>

            <p>If you have a newer NVIDIA card you could use ShadowPlay.</p>
<p>Or something like OBS, which you normally use to stream games, but can be used to record locally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>use the "record ", “stop”, and "playdemo " commands in the console to record gameplay, stop the recording, and play back the recording, respectively.  If you look around, there are a few ways to render these demo files;  Console commands or just recording with fraps, etc. while the demo plays back.  This system is used in a bunch of other source games, so there is help out there.</p>
<p>Using this has little to no affect on gameplay or framerate.</p>

</aside>
<p>That does not work in GoldSrc though.</p>
<p>Also I tried FRAPS a few years ago and had an awful time with it. I have no intention of using it.</p>

<p>Source has a built in recording feature, but it can be kinda janky.</p>
<p>I don’t record footage foten, so I’m sure osmeone else has better suggestion, but from me, I’ve used Bandicam before, though it can do a number on your FPS (not as bad as Fraps in my experience, but sometimes it can be a bit noticeable).<br>
Also, OBS works surprisingly well, though quality isn’t always great.</p>

<p>Alright. I’m concerned about recording while playing Black Mesa, but if I knock down the resolution to 720p and turn off a few graphical settings I should be okay.</p>
