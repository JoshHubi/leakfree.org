    <title>how do i create a mod with source SDK 2013?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-do-i-create-a-mod-with-source-sdk-2013/12808</link>
    <description>going to keep this short

valve phased out the old source SDK launcher, and with it the create a mod wizard to make a mod and directory, and i have no clue on how to create my own custom mod without it.

I&#39;ve downloaded the source code from github but i have no idea what to do with it, and valve has nothing useful on their developer community wiki.

so can someone give me some instructions? also I&#39;m using content from HL2 and it&#39;s episodes if that&#39;s important</description>

            <p>okay i followed it but i’ve got 2 questions now.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>what do i put in my “sourcemods” folder? do i just put in the “mod_episodic” folder and leave the source code and other stuff in some random folder? or do i have to put it in a specific place?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as far as accessing hammer editor and other tools go, do i just access it under the bin folder in the HL2 files or is there something specific i need to use with the SDK</p>
</li>
</ol>
