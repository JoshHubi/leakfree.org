    <title>Game crashes at bm_c2a2c - game ending bug</title>

    <description>Hi there

Great game so far, but Ive found a bug that makes the bulk of it unplayable. In Surface Tension, as soon as I get to the loading screen that takes me to map bm_c2a2c my game crashes. it says &quot;Hl2.exe unplayable&quot; or something like that. Ive tried loading my game from multiple save files, playing the whole chapter through again, tried reinstalling the game, and tried the game even at lowest settings but it always freezes right at that exact same point. Your thoughts? 

Andy

<p>… Your thoughts?</p>

<p>Your system specs are generally OK for the game. The bug you’re hitting seems to me moderately widespread (i.e. there are a number of people reporting various variations of it) and there’s no known reason for it to happen. Some people reported that they had this one fixed by moveing their Steam installation directory to the “C:\Games\Steam”, other reported that the bug auto-healed itself after performing complete system reboot and toggling Steam offline and then back online. Third reported that deleting up models and sound caches and having the game reconstruct them fixed it. Caches are files with .cache extension located under the BMS folder. I can’t give you the exact names/locationg right now because I’m away from my main workstation where I have Steam and BMS installed. Look for something like modelsounds.cache file and delete it. Look for a folder named like “soundcache” under BMS/maps and delete everything from inside it.</p>
<p>Lastly, there’s a number of people who seem to not be able to resolve this bug and still trying to find a solution. Thus If you happen to fix your problem using on of the methods I had described above or would happen to find a new way to get it fixed - please report back so other people could benefit of your findings.</p>
