    <title>Iceland</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/iceland/7212</link>
    <description>Anyone of you that have read about the new eruption from the volcano Grimsvötn in Iceland? Same thing happened last year when Norwegian newspapers invented the term &quot;askefast&quot; (ash-stuck) that cost companies like Norwegian and SAS a lot of money. Now a new ash cloud has appeared and the airline companies is already having issues.

Even if we can&#39;t travel by plane, it is one other thing that concerns me. Iceland is located just on the border between two continental plates. This was what created this temporary island, but it will not be there forever. Back in 05 (or something like that), there were a few eruptions and that created a small new island. So is Iceland already going to sink into the ocean because of the increasing eruptions or is still being created?</description>

<p>That is… astonishing…</p>
<p>Anyway, back on topic: Continental plates move relative to each other, but are a constant size. At one end, it will be being pushed under or over the adjacent plate, depending on which one is denser. Plates stay as a constant size, so at the other end, material is being deposited from within the mantle of the earth to maintain the size of the plate.</p>
<p>Iceland lies on the borders of the North American and the Eurasian plates, where they are moving apart. So the volcanoes are this new material being deposited from the mantle. If anything, it will get bigger! But we’re talking in geological time, so I wouldn’t start buying up land just yet  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
