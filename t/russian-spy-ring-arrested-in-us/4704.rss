    <title>Russian Spy Ring arrested in US!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/russian-spy-ring-arrested-in-us/4704</link>
    <description>This makes no fucking sense, a dozen people in the US just got arrested and accused of being a spy right - one of them has  been released already, none of them are being charged with &quot;espionage&quot; because they never spied on anyone or obtained any classified information. They had all been living in the US for quite some time and had careers and marriages. They are being accused of swapping &quot;briefcases and newspapers&quot; (of course not containing any classified information) as well as burying money in a park or something and doing other things that seemed &quot;spy-like.&quot; The arrests were supposedly triggered by the fact that one of the &quot;spies&quot; was going to go back to russia permanently (again, not carrying information - just moving).

Can someone tell me what the fuck this is? The most rational explanation I&#39;ve heard is that the arrests were a CIA covert op to make the Democratic government look weak on national security and therefore derail [url=&#39;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/02/pelosi-blocks-intel-bid-increased-congressional-oversight-cia/&#39;]Pelosi&#39;s CIA transparency bill[/url] that is making its way thru congress.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Many Russian officials and analysts said they presumed that hawkish elements within the U.S. government had engineered and timed the arrests to embarrass President Obama and undermine the “reset.” Mr. Putin echoed that concern during a meeting at his residence outside Moscow.</p>

<p>So you admit that factions within the US military/intelligence establishment “probably” timed these arrests to damage the White House’s efforts to thaw relations with a foreign power, but you’re saying it isn’t worth discussing because “everyone does it?” That’s an almost comically childish point of view.</p>

</aside>
<p>Nope, I’m saying that there is some ulterior motive, but there is no way to actually know what it is, and just throwing out some motive without proof makes you look like a conspiracy nut, as you have hopefully noticed.</p>

<p>There probably is an ulterior motive for the timing, the spies posed no imminent threat, but at this point I figure every action by everyone in the government has an ulterior motive. Instead of figuring it out, support the things you want to support and don’t complain about move against them without definitive proof. It won’t convince anyone.</p>

<p>Are you talking about today or during the Cold War? Cold War’s obvious, different economic philosophies.</p>
<p>Today, we aren’t enemies. Allies will spy on other allies just in case they become enemies. Its not a sign of hatred or rivalry, its a sign of acceptance that every country’s first responsibility is to itself, and as such everyone else could become an enemy at any time.</p>

            <p>Why would Russia actually send those spies? I thought the cold war was over already. I thought the relationship between America and russia was getting better.</p>

            <p>There probably is an ulterior motive for the timing, the spies posed no imminent threat, but at this point I figure every action by everyone in the government has an ulterior motive. Instead of figuring it out, support the things you want to support and don’t complain about move against them without definitive proof. It won’t convince anyone.</p>

            <p>If they weren’t spies, Russia wouldn’t be doing a trade for American spies that they caught. But this still doesn’t explain the timing.</p>

<p>I’ve given up following news. All new news can be summed up like this: the rich fuck over the country in some genius new way.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is this actually relevant to the spies or are you just being off topic.</p>
<p>Anyway, apparently we’re getting some of our spies for some of these spies. Basically about as much came of this as I thought it would.</p>
<p>As a side note, we seem to be getting a much better deal out of this than russia.</p>
<p>Also, shadow, if they weren’t spies, they were doing some pretty weird stuff, i.e. using false names.</p>

            <p>BTW, I know many patriots will believe that they are spies. I just know. Not to say that patriots are all dumbasses, but there are alot of american patriots that still have their mind in the cold war.</p>
