    <description>Hi guys,

i&#39;m not here to ask if there is/there will be a mp for black mesa source, i&#39;m here because i already made this, using the console, but with some problems.

Screenshots:

The problem is with the player as you can see, i already tried activating sv_cheats and using setmodel, but  nothing changes.

I tried &quot;setmodel models/zombies/zombie_guard.dml&quot; (an existing model) but it simply says nothing, why? Maybe i&#39;m simply doing something wrong :|

For the rest, the game is ok, except naturally for some doors that close and i can&#39;t go in if the other player is in the room, and a crash after the explosion in the test room :3

            <p>I’ll try that later. It seems it still works extremely derpy then.<br>
So yeah, it’s ALMOST playable. Most things work, especially NPCs n shit. The most annoying bugs are that dying stuff and when, well, it crashes for no fucking reason (i suppose cause of tons of shit going on).</p>

            <p>How the fuck do i read minidumps, i wanna know why the fuck is it crashing.<br>
So guys, for your own safety, ONLY use noclip and, if you die,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">give item_suit; give weapon_crowbar</code></pre>
<p>Lowered maxplayers to 4.<br>
And stop turning on godmode ffs, it turns it on for everyone.<br>
There’s also some weird shit going on with mapchange. The server gets stuck in an infinite mapchange loop, so i assume only the host can exit maps properly.<br>
upd: it also seems you can’t set off triggers or collect items after you die. The game runs much smoother with all BM options off and in DX8 mode.</p>

</aside>
<p>You can’t load/save in mp, the best thing you can do is change map to change the part of the game where you are playing (changelevel if you are already playing, otherwise map)<br>
The other npcs are fully working, except that if one player goes ahead and a door closes, you are locked behind and you have to do noclip.</p>
<p>And also achievements can be unlocked by both the players  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Usually when you die you respawn at the start of the level, and you have to noclip to return to where you were.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It’s simple. (you need the console)</p>
<p>Type in the console:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>net_start<br>
maxplayers 4<br>
sv_lan 0<br>
map [map name]</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The client, should open the console and type:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>connect [ip]</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Naturally replace the map name with the real map name (bm_…) and the ip with your ip.<br>
If you get stuck somewhere (very probably) type:</p>

<p>sv_cheats 1<br>
noclip</p>

            <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>i’m not here to ask if there is/there will be a mp for black mesa source, i’m here because i already made this, using the console, but with some problems.</p>
<p>Screenshots:</p>
<p><a href="https://imageshack.us/g/1/9764536/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://imageshack.us/g/1/9764536/</a></p>
<p>The problem is with the player as you can see, i already tried activating sv_cheats and using setmodel, but  nothing changes.</p>
<p>I tried “setmodel models/zombies/zombie_guard.dml” (an existing model) but it simply says nothing, why? Maybe i’m simply doing something wrong <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>For the rest, the game is ok, except naturally for some doors that close and i can’t go in if the other player is in the room, and a crash after the explosion in the test room :3</p>
