    <title>Gmod weapons porting</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gmod-weapons-porting/12518</link>
    <description>Sorry for spamming in wrong forum section,but did you know how to port for example DAO 12 weapon from Battlefield 3 in Gmod? What file extensions to Gmod weapons got? Is porting and development of weapons is possible in 3DS Max 2014? I think it isn&#39;t because when I click to upper right scene called &quot;Front+Wireframe&quot; and when I press Alt+B 3DS Max displays me only Viewport Background Configuration. It also looks like Autodesk don&#39;t make 3DS Max 2014 yet,isn&#39;t it? :&#39;(

EDIT: One more thing about this DAO 12 weapon if you would like ask me about textures. Yes I download all textures and pictures of that weapon from this video [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BjbXHZn8Vw[/url]. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s malfunctioning with Viewport Background? Maybe Alpha Channel is also mulfunctioning?</description>

<p>Wrong site, buddy. Try posting it here, on THE Garry’s Mod forums.</p>

            <p>This isn’t even close to a Black Mesa related question.</p>
<p>Regardless, I’m not entirely sure what you’re asking, so I’ll guess.<br>
I’m guessing you’ve probably never even opened a modeling program, nor have any experience with Source, in which case you should probably do both of those things, first. I couldn’t point you in the direction of any modeling tutorials, however <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Category:Modeling" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this page</a> should tell you all you need to know about Source (and by extension, Garry’s Mod) models.</p>
<p>As for getting the weapon functioning in game, I’d suggest you pick up some Lua, and yeah, you’ll have this DAO-12 in Garry’s Mod well before 2020.</p>
<p>Have fun, good luck!</p>
