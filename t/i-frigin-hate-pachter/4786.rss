    <description>Goddamn that Michael Pachter, why does every single game website treat him like the de facto expert on the videogame industry?

The guy doesn&#39;t play videogames, he has no feeling whatsoever what gamers want and how the industry (fails to) deliver. For an industry analyst he knows jack fucking shit about the industry. And what little he does know is confined to console games, the fact that the PC is a more open platform and that games are cheaper on the PC is unknown to him.

This is the guy who encourages publishers to charge $15-$20 for a stupid little mappack, he&#39;s basically encouraging publishers like Activision (who are already greedy as fuck) to squeeze every last penny from people.

All he does is make these broad generalizations that every other moron with half a brain can make, and sell it as his expert opinion.

The only guy more obnoxious than Pachter is Bobby feckin&#39; Kotick!</description>

            <p>Unrelated: In MW2 I always felt bad for killing the spec ops soldiers near the end of the game, they’re just doing thier jobs, they probably didn’t even know what was going on.</p>

<p>In my obviously-knowing-nothing-about-games opinion: the plot of Modern Warfare 2 was the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen; my jaw was dropping while I was playing.

What cracks me up is that <span class="bbcode-b">I read all the “No Russian” criticism</span> about being put in the role of a terrorist, but being in the role of a guy gunning down American troops is worse.

<p>true, and the “No Russian” thing was WAY to much criticized, it wasn’t that bad (no offense)</p>

<p>And Sony - I’m not sure if they had a firm agreement but they may have had a handshake - said to Take-Two, “You’ve got to give us something else.” And the “something else” was a zombie game that Rockstar wanted to work on.

Rockstar realised they were up against a saturated market and Valve, and, <span class="bbcode-b">“What can we possibly do that will be any better than what Valve’s done?”</span> They started again and that’s when they came up with the idea of The Agent, which nobody actually knows what it is.

            <p>Yeah. He’s the laughing stock of the PC section in Gametrailers ever since he said that there’s no PC as powerful as the PS3.</p>

            <p>Goddamn that Michael Pachter, why does every single game website treat him like the de facto expert on the videogame industry?</p>
<p>The guy doesn’t play videogames, he has no feeling whatsoever what gamers want and how the industry (fails to) deliver. For an industry analyst he knows jack fucking shit about the industry. And what little he does know is confined to console games, the fact that the PC is a more open platform and that games are cheaper on the PC is unknown to him.</p>
<p>This is the guy who encourages publishers to charge $15-$20 for a stupid little mappack, he’s basically encouraging publishers like Activision (who are already greedy as fuck) to squeeze every last penny from people.</p>
<p>All he does is make these broad generalizations that every other moron with half a brain can make, and sell it as his expert opinion.</p>
<p>The only guy more obnoxious than Pachter is Bobby feckin’ Kotick!</p>
