    <title>Track 7 music file?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/track-7-music-file/1452</link>
    <description>A while ago I think I downloaded some of the Black Mesa soundtrack and it included a piece called Track 7 and a Track 7 Remix. Now when I look at the game music download section they are missing. Are they available anywhere, and are there more complete versions of them (mine were like 1:30 long)?

Sorry if this is the wrong forum, I wasn&#39;t too sure.</description>

            <p>I remember there being a old thread about this song.  They did say it wasn’t really meant for the mod and they weren’t sure where to place it anyway.  A few suggestions were made by people who enjoyed the music including me (made a HL video using the music) but weather or not they found a place for it is up in the air.</p>
<p>Not sure if Nielson ever intended this to be longer but since its the perfect length for a HL song that’s probably why it was mistakenly included a while back.</p>

            <p>IIRC it wasn’t supposed to be for Black Mesa, but they accidentally included it, because everybody liked it so much, they said they’d include it in the mod.</p>

            <p>Thanks guys, that’s basically what I wanted. I guess there’s no longer versions, though Nielsen really makes great music.</p>

            <p>The only thing I recall is that it somehow leaked out in a media release a couple years back when it wasn’t ready yet.  But the fact that it was mistaken for media means it’s probably associated with the mod, right? (fingers crossed)</p>

            <p>Yep… track 7 and demo 4 are basically the same song remixed.  However I fail to remember if/how they might be related to the game itself.  I believe they are not, but I am still hoping for a full song when the release of the soundtrack comes.</p>

            <p>No, all the other songs I have are the ones on the download page. It’s just as if Track 7 and it’s remix version are randomly missing from the download page now.</p>

            <p>That’s funny, because the Black Mesa soundtrack was never released. Except for the six tracks on the downloads page. I’m pretty sure that’s not what you downloaded.</p>
