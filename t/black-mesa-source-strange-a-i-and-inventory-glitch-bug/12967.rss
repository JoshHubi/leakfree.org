    <title>Black Mesa Source: Strange A.I. and Inventory Glitch/Bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-source-strange-a-i-and-inventory-glitch-bug/12967</link>
    <description>Okay, Here we go...

So I was bored one day and I wanted to play Black Mesa Source...You don&#39;t know what Black Mesa is...get out of here......but if you do know what I&#39;m talking about, this is what happened...

As I was saying, I launched Black Mesa and loaded up my latest save file. (It was at the bit where a tank is trying to shoot you and your standing next to a car repair station.) I look at the right side of my screen and I see some text saying A.I. Disabled and what do you know THE A.I. IS DISABLED!!!

Before you reply:
I have typed ai_disable 0
I have typed ai_resume
I have re-launched the game about 2.6 billion times.

It would be great if you could help.

Thanks a lot.</description>

<p>If that doesn’t work, I would recommend uninstalling and reinstalling Black Mesa. Before you do that though, backup your saves and your gamestate.txt file (achievement data).</p>
