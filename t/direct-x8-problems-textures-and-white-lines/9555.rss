    <title>Direct X8 problems (Textures and white lines)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/direct-x8-problems-textures-and-white-lines/9555</link>
    <description>Hiya.

I´m playing in DX8 mode (Baddy graphics card are cool in 2012) and the game is playable and cool. But the problems is
1- A white line in the middle of the screen (Really really annoying
2- Missing Eye textures, green water (the toxic of the beggining) and Pistol (I don´t go too far, but maybe there are more textures)
3- Not a problem of DX8 but, The spanish translation have problems with á or ó. When you start a new chapter the words with that don´t show (But the subtitles don´t have this problem)

Any form to fix this without need to play in DX9?

Specs: Amd Phenom x3 2.1
          3GB RAM ddr3
           Nvidia 6150 Se Integrated

Screen of the problem (Sorry for no pistol)

And too for making the game works with DX8

            <p>First question: Did you install the most recent graphic card drivers?<br>
If not, you should do so. Also check if Half-Life 2 is compatible with your graphics card or if there are known issues (as it uses the same engine)…</p>
