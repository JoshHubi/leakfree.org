    <description>After posting a pic of my arm, Jokerine make this suggestion jokingly, but I think it&#39;s genius.

I&#39;ll be kicking off with the scar I got from my burn.

I have a few others, but they are almost invisible these days.

<p>silly faggot, metho is for drinking, not burning</p>
<p>Also most of my scars are on my head. Two in my left eyebrow (one baseball bat, one barbeque) and another above my ear (bit of wood). None of these blows ever left me worse for the wear. :retard:</p>

<p>I drink probably 2 -3 litres of Tea a day depending on when I get up and how long I’m in the house. I probably get through a pint or so of milk just from the tea and then quite a bit more on the cereal. I could measure if you want.</p>

            <p>No significant scars, just minor ones that have been there for so long you can barely see them. Several injuries but never any broken bones.<br>
A trampoline once fell on me, crushing my foot and I couldn’t walk for weeks.</p>

            <p>Lol.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t worry about half a litre. I’ve drunk a pint or more (so over half a litre - UK pints are bigger than US pints, and come in at 568ml) a day for years with no harm. There’s still a big jump up to half a gallon (even the smaller US gallon).</p>
<p>Either way, I’ve never broken a bone - not even when I was run over by a van, though when I was a kid I got a green stick fracture (youthful, still growing bones tend to bend and splinter rather than snapping, like a still green and growing stick on a tree does) in my arm. I don’t have any scars worth showing either - no really serious cuts and I don’t scar very visibly.</p>

<p>Done by a fuckin’ bear, while I was wrestling him.  Now it’s about a millimeter and a half high.[COLOR=‘White’]No seriously it was done by a patio-door. I don’t know why I felt, but I did and my arm scratched on the door handle. It was easily half an inch deep, it was all blue inside but strangely it didn’t hurt. Probably because it was so deep that the sensory receptors were just not there anymore, therefore not able to transmit the pain.</p>

<p>The camera didn’t exactly show it that well but what that is there is the result of most of the skin being flayed off my left elbow. Quite a few years ago me and my friends were playing the game of “jump over the tennis net” and one of my friends pulled the net up so that it caught my foot. Naturally I went flying and landed most of my weight on my elbow. Luckily it didn’t break (I really don’t know how it didn’t break considering the force that I landed on the ground). Anyway I went to the school nurse after P.E. (I just carried on playing tennis until the end of the lesson) and he cleaned it up and gave me a bandage thing and said there was no point in going to hospital. Bare in mind that pretty much all of the skin on my elbow was gone (make a ring with your thumb and index finger and put it over your elbow, that is roughly how much was gone) and you could see the bone, it was also bleeding for most of the rest of that day.</p>
<p>Anyway that was 3 years ago now and it’s “healed” this much. The pink part is all new skin and it doesn’t feel like skin at all as it’s smooth (kind of like the frictionless pads on the bottom of computer mice). Also as far as I can tell, there are no nerve endings there or they aren’t working because I can touch it and not feel it at all.</p>
<p>I have various other scars from skateboarding and such. One is covered up by my right eyebrow although you can see a faint line underneath the hairs if you look closely. Also my left hip has various marks on it from falling over (skateboarding) but nothing paticularly spectacular.</p>

            <p>My left hand and right arm are all scarred up. My favorite is from when I grabbed a glass doorknob without knowing it was actually broken.</p>

            <p>I have a lot of scars, one across the forehead one across the cheek, one on my left shoulder, one across the stomach, quite a few on my left arm, and a small one on my right hand. oddly enough I have never broken a bone <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’ll post pics when I get around to taking pictures of them all.</p>

            <p>I’d post my right knee and my right elbow, but I still don’t have my camera available (rage) and my phone camera doesn’t show them that well. Just some scratches I got from biking.</p>

            <p>Uh, I told Collision that I would post here if he created the thread, so what the heck.</p>
<p>MAH HAND<br>
<img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f0984456f8dd47c5beb0a68b72c3d6cf62ef2aa.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="6I6PuuEmauXO02up6hgyYXrei26" width="300" height="300"></p>
<p>The camera is not very good (but better than the phone camera, I guess), but I think that the three long scars are pretty visible. By the way, they were self-inflicted. <span class="bbcode-b">INB4 LOLO EMO.</span> The pic may not be very clear, so, <a href="https://i28.tinypic.com/35mky3d.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>’s a closer shot, maybe it will make them clearer. My hand was kinda cold at the moment; when it is warm, the scars pop up like freakin’ neon signs  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I also noticed that I have a pretty ugly scar on my knee, from this one time I visited the countryside a few years ago. Might post a pic later if I manage to remember.</p>
