<p>Here you‚Äôre assuming every religion even has the concept of sins. Buddhism, for example, does not, as far as I know.</p>

<p>This is precisely my point, actually. Saved by works. As long as you believe in our religion and do what it tells you to do. Thats works. You do something  to save yourself. You choose to believe in Christianity and you save yourself, as you say.<br>
That‚Äôs not it. That‚Äôs the point. That‚Äôs what makes Christianity different.<br>
You‚Äôve done something wrong. Nothing you can do can change that. You‚Äôve earned sin. Punishment is death.<br>
Think of it this way. The Bible says to obey God‚Äôs commands. I‚Äôm a Christian, and I still sin every day. I still disobey! I earn death every day by my actions.<br>
How are you saved? By <span class="bbcode-i">grace</span> through <span class="bbcode-i">faith</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.</span> You can‚Äôt come up with faith, you have to be given faith from God.<br>
You cant just believe in ‚Äòour‚Äô religion, and you can‚Äôt just do what it tells you to do. And neither can I.</p>

<p>You didn‚Äôt watch the entire video did you?I think you‚Äôd first have to get a rational argument out of him first before you could get something that nigh-impossible.</p>
<p>This is like talking to a brick wall, so I‚Äôm done with this topic, but I will leave you one last question specifically about christianity: If god created everything in the universe and Jesus is god and can perform miracles (albeit not depicted as impressive as the former) why did he need to wreck the vagina of one random young girl that he himself created, merely to have a human body when he could have just cut to the chase?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I did watch the entire video. Like I said somethings werent bad. Most of the arguments were off-topic, and didnt reach any conclusions though. He started getting to important points around the 6 minute mark. I summarized the main points, and mostly agreed with him. The cosmological argument is not intended to prove Christianity, but why a God is logical. A deity is a potential cause. He was wrong in saying that the universe could have been going on forever. Firstly there are no infinities in a finite universe, and secondly my bonus fact explains one important reason why scientifically the universe must have started at one point in time.<br>
I didnt mention the well what caused God part, cause I thought it was silly.<br>
Of course nothing caused God. If something did, fine call that thing God instead.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIrreducible complexity‚Äù is a term invented by creationists because, unfortunately, they don‚Äôt know how evolution happened.  They look at the eyeball, for example, and suggest that, if any one of the mechanisms inside the eyeball were to be removed, the eye would no longer function.</p>
<p>Evolution is not a puzzle someone puts together.    You don‚Äôt take a spare vocal cord here, a lymph node there, and many other thousands of parts to create a human being, nor do you take a lens here, some vitreous humor there, and so forth and create an eye like that.</p>

<p>It attempts to prove that certain things couldn‚Äôt have evolved. That has nothing to do with evolution? Does anybody claim to know how the eyeball evolved?</p>

<p>Wow, this thread full of Christian flamebaiting, I don‚Äôt know why I bother to post this.</p>
<p>As for the original poster‚Äôs request, you want evidence that God exists?  As a Christian, I can say that there is no proof that He does exist.  If there was solid, 100% undeniable proof that He did, then it wouldn‚Äôt be faith now would it? So I don‚Äôt think that there ever will be proof.</p>

<p>Woah man. What do you mean there is no proof? Psalm 19.<br>
1 The heavens declare the glory of God;<br>
the skies proclaim the work of his hands.<br>
2 Day after day they pour forth speech;<br>
night after night they display knowledge.<br>
3 There is no speech or language<br>
where their voice is not heard.<br>
4 Their voice goes out into all the earth,<br>
their words to the ends of the world.</p>

<p>The above (edit: jeffraven‚Äôs) post is one of the main reasons why I do not believe:<br>
You do not need proof for god, because you have faith. The only reason you have faith is that you were taught, in one way or the other, to have faith.<br>
From that we can logically conclude that faith is completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>Therefore, what <span class="bbcode-i">reason</span> is there behind your faith? What makes you think the things you have been taught are better or more correct than what, say, an atheist or a muslim have been taught?</p>
<p>In light of that, the correct thing to do is to deduce conclusions logically from observations, also known as <span class="bbcode-i">science</span>; no god or higher power or anything comes into play that way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, knowledge must come from science; religion comes from arbitrary teachings, and is therefore irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<ol>
<li>Faith is no substitute for proof. Neither is faith something you turn to when you have no proof. That‚Äôs a foolish belief rather than faith.</li>
<li>You can‚Äôt teach faith. Then it‚Äôs not faith.</li>
<li>Knowledge can be discovered by science, but science can also be wrong. Science can and does point to a creator, namely God.</li>
<li>What makes my religion better? I don‚Äôt believe other religions are valid. I dont believe other religions are logical. I also believe that because of sin we reject truth. I believe I didnt choose Christianity, because as a sinful rebellious against God person, I dont choose God.  I believe my faith is God given, and Im glad it is because I never would have figured it out.</li>

<p>This is precisely my point, actually. Saved by works. As long as you believe in our religion and do what it tells you to do. Thats works. You do something  to save yourself. You choose to believe in Christianity and you save yourself, as you say.<br>
That‚Äôs not it. That‚Äôs the point. That‚Äôs what makes Christianity different.<br>
You‚Äôve done something wrong. Nothing you can do can change that. You‚Äôve earned sin. Punishment is death.<br>
Think of it this way. The Bible says to obey God‚Äôs commands. I‚Äôm a Christian, and I still sin every day. I still disobey! I earn death every day by my actions.<br>
How are you saved? By <span class="bbcode-i">grace</span> through <span class="bbcode-i">faith</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.</span> You can‚Äôt come up with faith, you have to be given faith from God.<br>
You cant just believe in ‚Äòour‚Äô religion, and you can‚Äôt just do what it tells you to do. And neither can I.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My point was this: pretty much every religion I can think of has a device to subjugate people to faith.<br>
Whether it is salvation through grace, or the possibility of enlightenment, those devices exist to have faith in the given religion based on nothing but, well, faith.</p>

If the lifespan of an organism is short, and it has many offspring, and there is much adversity, evolution will be quicker.<br>
There are also acceptable theories on how evolution can also happen very quickly. I.e. a giraffe‚Äôs neck becomes much larger in only a few generations, as opposed to over thousands of years (just an example to illustrate, don‚Äôt know how valid it is).

Your parents have faith and pass it on to you by their actions and their words.<br>

Alternatively, you read books or articles, do research on the internet, whatever, and come by your faith in that way.</p>
<p>Faith has to come from somewhere, therefore it is taught.</p>

<p>Yes, science can be wrong, but the current state of science is always based on the best conclusions that have been made from the current available evidence. Faith is based on indoctrination and millennium-old books.<br>

If anything, a god by its very nature is opposite to what science is supposed to be.<br>
Science tries to explain things; it tries to find the origin and reason of things.<br>
God is inexplicable, and has no reason or origin. It‚Äôs just another way of man trying to stop the old infinite question of ‚Äúif x creates y, what created x?‚Äù which has been shown to be unnecessary in the first place from what I understand is the current accepted theory of the universe.</p>

<p>It attempts to prove that certain things couldn‚Äôt have evolved. That has nothing to do with evolution? Does anybody claim to know how the eyeball evolved?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, yes.  Many people.  Just because YOU may not know doesn‚Äôt mean that NO ONE knows how it happened.</p>
<p>Here are just a couple of links from the FIRST PAGE ON GOOGLE:<br>
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html" data-bbcode="true">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html</a><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye" data-bbcode="true">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye</a></p>
<p>Then they go on to misquote Darwin (as if proving Darwin wrong does a thing to proving evolution wrong) when they say he said, ‚ÄúTo suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.‚Äù</p>
<p>Had they continued the quote, they would‚Äôve blown their case right out of the water:</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. When it was first said that the sun stood still and the world turned round, the common sense of mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of Vox populi, vox Dei, as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in science. Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to its possessor, as is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case; and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest organisms in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed with this special sensibility.‚Äù</p>

<p>Everyone is fighting a losing battle with one another. You‚Äôre looking for answers that are impossible to find, as well as trying to get the other person to admit defeat by asking him questions he can‚Äôt answer in any way that would satisfy you. The religious debate is so enfuriating because it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre speaking different languages - no person can answer the other‚Äôs questions in a way that would satisfy the other. Every point you make can be countered in an equally unconstructive way so that you end up back where you starting having achieved nothing. <span class="bbcode-i">That‚Äôs the whole point of it.</span></p>
<p>Logic and belief, science and religion - you have to admit, it‚Äôs a battle that looks almost bespoke in its construction, every single aspect of every single argument negating the other. And yet they always seem so intrinsically twined. Where it gets muddled is when people try to argue by talking about something that they have virtually no understanding of and jumping to silly conclusions.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not attacking you personally, but your post contradicts itself. You say that this is my opinion, but you state your argument as cold fact. I agree with you in parts though. There is no reason that one belief system should be greater than another belief system. The reason is that what you believe in cannot be confirmed as fact, and therefore there is no right or wrong in the matter. Religions teach moral laws, but there is no, as far as I know, teaching of direct competition with another religion.<br>
What they do teach is to preach to the people who have no faith, but here is where I get muddled. What right do you have to preach to others? Is it moral to try and convert others, some who may not have a certain intellectual defence to be able to counter your teachings? That is something I‚Äôve always questioned about religion.</p>

<p>As I‚Äôve said before, in a different thread I believe, religion is faith, science is the scientific method. The scientific method doesn‚Äôt fit with religion and it makes no sense that part of the universe follows the scientific method and another part doesn‚Äôt.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Science and religion <span class="bbcode-i">are</span> compatible. That‚Äôs the whole point of the religious debate that has been going on for thousands of years. The problem lies in the fact that religious texts are debateable, science is not. Therefore, people try and fit science around religion and they clash. Taking the Creation story for example - since God‚Äôs ways are not ours and therefore his notion of time is also not ours, seven days to him could be 3 billion years to us. When he made something in a day, that could appear as evolution to us that took place over several million years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whenever religion seems to contradict science in the form of miracles, an explanation is always available. For example, when Jesus calmed the storm, you could say that storms on the Sea of Gallillee have been known to stop almost instantaneously, here is the reasoning etc. etc. It was merely coincidence, here is our proof. However, you could also counter-argue that by saying that God is the master of time and therefore, it‚Äôs not so much controlling weather as it is knowing when the storm will cease. Virtually all miracles have a scientific explanation, but that doesn‚Äôt make the miracle any less miraculous. Science and religion are compatible, but it‚Äôs like hammering a square peg into a round hole - you can do it, but only with force and a lot of swearing.</p>

<p>If god created everything in the universe and Jesus is god and can perform miracles (albeit not depicted as impressive as the former) why did he need to wreck the vagina of one random young girl that he himself created, merely to have a human body when he could have just cut to the chase?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The whole point was that he was born as a human, therefore entwining God and man. I think the reasoning behind this was that he could be proved as human and above all killed as a human.</p>
<p>Also, I‚Äôd like to point out something that I‚Äôve concluded about belief, or faith. You can <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> believe in something 100%, because it‚Äôs extremely difficult to quantify something so ambiguous as faith. You can say that this chair is made of wood or that this is metal, but you‚Äôre basing your belief on something that you‚Äôve been taught. You make an educated guess as to its nature, but in the end you can never be 100% sure. It‚Äôs exactly the same with religion. I‚Äôve struggled with religion all my life. I‚Äôve never (perhaps due to lack of courage) split with it entirely, but then again I‚Äôve never fervently believed in it, again perhaps due to lack of courage. However, I think of it as a journey. Believing in something 100% is impossible, but I‚Äôll damn well try, if only to have a better understanding of human nature and how I can better myself as a person. If I get to the end of the journey dispirited with humanity and with no faith whatsoever, then so be it, I‚Äôll have learnt something. However, if I don‚Äôt try at all then I‚Äôll look back on my life and see myself as a coward, someone who took someones teaching and took it at face value without exploring it and followed other people blindly.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve always questioned religion and its effects - sometimes I agree with it, at other times I don‚Äôt, but I think of myself as someone who, having come from a religious background, can step back and look at it without bias. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion, as many others have, that it is man‚Äôs interpretation of religion and the power that comes with so much belief that corrupts it. At its very heart, religion is a philosophy, something that will better humanity as a whole if people live by its teachings.</p>
<p>Where the whole situation gets muddled is the belief in an all-powerful God and the afterlife. People who question religion are forever looking for proof and challenging those who believe in a god to deliver something, when everyone knows that this is impossible and therefore futile.<br>
I think the real question is why is everyond so aggressive about it? What will you gain or lose by trying in vain to prove that you are right and the other person is wrong? You‚Äôre both speaking different languages.</p>

<p>I agree with you on this to an extent. It <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> impossible to prove the existence of a god, so I‚Äôll never ask for proof (unless someone claims there is evidence or proof, as has been the case in this thread).<br>
Despite that, if you look at where religion comes from, historically as well as ‚Äòsocially,‚Äô if you will (i.e. how people get their religion), I believe it makes religion seem completely arbitrary and baseless, which defeats, in my view, every reason to have faith.</p>
<p>All that doesn‚Äôt mean that debating it can‚Äôt be interesting, though, for both sides.</p>

<p>Religion is nothing but a scape goat for people to scared to really face whatever is after death, not only that but the miracles performed by ‚ÄúGods son‚Äù are so full of stupidity, if someone in MODERN times ran around doing all the ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù he performed, the last thing that would be in your mind would be ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs obviously gods son‚Äù.

I mean if the primitive people in his OWN time wouldn‚Äôt follow him why do some many people believe in it today? Because it happen a VERY long time ago, Not only that but it has also been embellished and exaggerated.</p>

<p>i dont wish to be rude or anything but i just want to state the fact that almost everything you said above is actually complete nonsense and actually i am pretty sure your knowlege of religion is very shrouded or unlearned‚Ä¶dont critisise religion when you have no idea what you are on about because actually re-reading all that the only thing you might be right about is homosexuality bit but you know there is a reason for that, the main reason why we are on this earth is to have kids and bring more into this life but if with homosexuality you cant do that and so defiles the whole point of life which is why is was not to be allowed by alot of churches.</p>

<p>what???..your kidding right you know you can be forgiving for all your sins apart from taking the life of another?</p>
<p>And lastly yes many religious parties have causes problems in the past but they were ‚ÄòCORRUPT‚Äô any true christian can never really cause any problem if all hes trying to do is be a good person and follow the ‚Äòsaviors‚Äô example. Which by the way had followers all over the place the 12 which folowed him were called diciples, yes, BUT thats another term for those who were basically helping him out but they werent his only folowers he has thousands all over the place.</p>
<p>There have been mentions that there is no purpose in god, and what created that god?</p>
<ol>
<li>God is eternal, so is the universe and every other universe which may too have their own seperate gods, however we are only human and find it hard to comprehend the fact there was no start and there is no end.<br>
2)The purpose of this life (which we chose to come down to, because we chose heveanly fathers plan) is to get a body so that we can become like him. Basically so we can become perfect and become gods but to do that we need to have a body and learn the difference between right and wrong like he does.3</li>
<li>Science is actually a major part (note when something is called a ‚Äò<em>name</em> Theory‚Äô, it is jsut a theory and so isnt fact). For all we know our heavenly father is actually the greatest science ever as he understands how to universe works and created it.</li>
</ol>
<p>All religion does, is help us to become our perfect form and so if followed correctly has no negative effects, so why not have faith in something that can only bring good?</p>
<p>i could say more but ive said too much all ready, please dont slander religion or beliefs just because of what you think you know unless your sure plz.</p>
