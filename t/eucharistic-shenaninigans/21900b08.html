<p>The problem with this is they didn’t discover religion using the scientific method. They started with the assumption that they were right. This causes strong bias and causes them to throw their training to the wind every time it contradicts their stubborn belief.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>None of that is really part of the debate ( amongst reasonable circles ). Evolution is proven. We’ve witnessed it. It’s getting to be very hard to deny our evolved roots, given the evidence. Though not without unproven or theorized patches, it’s getting to be evident that we are evolved creatures as well.<br>
The debate of religion is that it can be argued that it’s symbolic, and intangible. It’s difficult to debate this because of the cyclic arguments they perpetuate. Because of our unique perspectives, and lack of ‘hive conscientiousness’ we cannot debate someones personal views, or feelings.<br>
It’s impossible for us as humans. The best that we can do is use tangible evidence and shared perceptual accepted items, and debate the evidence we have to describe it, and it’s function.</p>

          <p>Pretty wordy, but I think I can get what your saying, and by using your logic, I can point out that emotion is not a valid argument and thus an argument based off faith is invalid.</p>

<p>My point was that you don’t assume God and conclude something else.

If the lifespan of an organism is short, and it has many offspring, and there is much adversity, evolution will be quicker.<br>
There are also acceptable theories on how evolution can also happen very quickly.

<p>How do you come by faith if not by teachings? The very nature of faith is the result of teachings.<br>
Your parents have faith and pass it on to you by their actions and their words.<br>
If not that, your peers, friends, colleagues influence your views to ‘guide’ you to faith as it were, effectively teaching you to have faith.<br>
Alternatively, you read books or articles, do research on the internet, whatever, and come by your faith in that way.</p>
<p>Faith has to come from somewhere, therefore it is taught.</p>
<p>You would not have a christian faith if you were born in Afghanistan. Generally, you would have a muslim faith. Why? Not because god gave you your faith, but because you gained your faith through environmental influences.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The point of faith is its not something taught. There’s nothing I can say or teach to anyone that will give them faith. Someone can go to church, read the Bible, strive to live by it’s teachings, and not have faith. No one can give someone else faith.<br>
Other religions say you need to find religion inside yourself. Find that faith inside of you.<br>
Christianity holds that natural man rejects God. Ever since Adam, the world is corrupted by sin. Sin is rebellion against God. No one has faith in God unless God first works in someone.</p>
<p>Someone can be told about a religion, and genuinely believe what they hear. I get what you’re saying. And yet this makes Christianity different.</p>

          <p>I did not know such denial of reality could exist.</p>
<p>You’re saying God exists but there is no way to prove him.<br>
You’re logic is the world is so purtiful and fills me with such warm and fuzzy feeling that god must exist.</p>
<p>You are saying information cannot appear by chance. Why not?</p>
<p>At all religious:<br>
The world follows natural laws or axioms. Nothing can go faster than the speed of light, mass cannot be created or destroyed, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another and many many more. God contradicts these. He can speak to you, so he is telepathic and his thoughts exceed that of the speed of light. We can’t find him so he probably isn’t matter but if he isn’t matter then what is he?  If he created the universe, then he created matter and energy, how does he create matter and energy? He sends you to Hell or Heaven. Where is Heaven and Hell? Are they some far away planets? If they are then where are they? How do you get to them?</p>
<p>What is God? Is he matter? Then what elements are he made of? How do the compounds he is made of give him the power to do what he does? If he isn’t matter, then what is he and how does he affect our universe? How does he make our universe? If he made us in his image then why are we corrupt? Why aren’t we telepathic? Why can’t we create matter? Why aren’t we all-knowing? How is he all-knowing?</p>
<p>Science states that everything follows natural logical laws, and as you say, god follows natural laws, yet in the above paragraphs he repeatedly breaks every single scientific natural law there is. God contradicts science so both cannot possible be true. Science and religion are mutually exclusive. Pick one.</p>

<p>I understood that; what I was trying say is that going from a complex organism, for example, to a god or intelligent design, is a big leap.</p>
<p>You say that “information can not arise form natural events.” This is, in my view, faulty for two reasons.<br>
First, information is relative and subjective. Information is only perceived as information by a mechanism or decoder if you will that can interpret that information. From that you could conclude that what to us may seem like information, could be totally nonsensical to other beings.<br>
Take language for example. No one <span class="bbcode-i">designed</span> language, it evolved through hundreds of thousands of years, basically by chance: words and grammatical constructs that were the ‘fittest,’ i.e. the most popular and the most commonly used, survived.</p>
<p>Second, ‘information’ arises naturally all the time. Nearly every natural process, from ecosystems to star systems, are governed by ‘information.’<br>
If simple informational systems can arise naturally, why not more complex ones over time?</p>

<p>The concept of a veritable “tree of life” is outdated. Current evolutionary theories include explanations for these bursts of evolution. Some things I can think of off the top of my head are natural disasters, like meteorites striking the earth, super volcanoes erupting, etc. These things could usher in a period of little evolution because there isn’t much to evolve, but as soon as life starts picking up again, spurts of evolution can occur.</p>

<p>This sort of argument is faulty and stems from the perception of time inherent to all humans.<br>

<p>You could in theory go back in time until the big bang, but before that, time does not exist and therefore concepts such as a beginning are irrelevant.</p>
<p>I know I’m not explaining this very well, but I suggest you read Stephen Hawking’s A Briefer History of Time if you haven’t already. It explains these concepts concisely and understandably.<br>
I must say that Stephen Hawking believes in god and does explain how he can still fit into everything in his book, but his arguments are entirely different from yours.</p>

<p>I know I said i quit this thread but I can’t let ignorance go unflamed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Neither can I, since you are clearly being the most ignorant here. I’m not criticising your views on evolution - I agree with it. Instead, I’m criticising your bigoted views on science and religion being either right or wrong.</p>
<p>Firstly, the whole question of science and religion is primarily a historic one in your case where, by the examples you chose, the earth isn’t flat and isn’t at the centre of the universe. Those ideas were first put forward when science and religion were far closer together, when indeed much scientific thinking <span class="bbcode-i">was</span> religious. The two were almost intertwined. Many of the greatest minds of those ages (Philolaus, Ptolemy, Herman of Reichenau, Copernicus, Galileo) were of a society where belief in gods, or God, was the norm. These men weren’t atheists - their ideas or discoveries didn’t dissuade them from religion, even when, in the case of Galileo, they were punished for their works. I say this to highlight that both in a historical background and a modern one, the line between science and religion isn’t cut and dry. You can’t simply state that one is right and one is wrong when they were born of the same idea - it’s just that one looked to a more philosophical, metaphysical arena for more contemplative, less introspective answers.</p>
<p>Your example of the earth being flat or at the center of the universe as being of a religious basis is also false. Those two ideas came from observation of our surroundings and drawing the simplest, easiest, most logical solution from that. Who knows how long those ideas have been around for. Christianity simply sponsored those ideas because they supported vague quotations in the Bible, and because religion ofted headed the scientific research in those times and, like all people, they were often resistant to change. There would have been many educated people who would have resisted any new theories too.</p>
<p>Secondly, you say that science has always been right. May I ask for proof, or is that too dismissive? Science has <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> been continually right. You can observe and study something and draw a conclusion from that, but that’s not to immediately say that, because it’s science, it must be correct. You’re drawing a conclusion from something and providing the best proof that you can come up with. It’s up to others to look at your work and decide whether or not it is correct or not and for it to become common knowledge. That’s pretty much what scientific theories are. If you look at the ideas of gravity or motion, or the theory of relativity or of quantum mechanics, these are ideas that have been written down and become accepted as common knowledge <span class="bbcode-i">because they must,</span> in that it is the most logical conclusion there is. Sound familiar? Even theories of dinosaurs or of multiple universes have become common belief now, when they are simply theories.</p>
<p>In many cases, such as the concept of gravity or of quantum physics, the ideas <span class="bbcode-i">have not been proven.</span> Taking the example of gravity - you can study its effects, but gravity itself is intangible, and it is still being debated and studied furiously today. My point is that science is by no means infallible. There have been theories and ideas and solid, supposedly proven facts, that have been proven wrong further down the line somewhere. All science is, is a theory upon a theory upon a theory that has entered into common knowledge. Very few things can be proven beyond all doubt. That sounds extreme but really it is quite logical. For example, prove to me that this desk is made of wood, or your chair of plastic. All you will show me is an idea - an idea with evidence arguing for it, yes, and evidence that I will most likely agree with, but it is undeniably an idea. And that is what science is - a belief. All you’ve done is got enough evidence for you to make that leap to certainty and belief and there you have it - you <span class="bbcode-i">believe</span> that the chair is made of plastic. This makes me sound very anti-science, but I’m just playing the Devil’s advocate in this case. But I digress.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a rant. I’m not taking sides in this particular discussion. I see myself as a person who respects both science and religion - I’m a logical person and yet I have a certain idiosyncracy within my nature that also makes be somewhat keen to believe in something far greater than human existence. Be that as it may though. Learn before you flame garth.</p>

          <p>But science is the BEST set of theories on top of theories. It explains everything far better than everything else.</p>
<p>There’s a tiny chance I’m wrong and there is a god and I’m being an idiot, but that chance is so slim I’m going to dismiss it. Much of science hasn’t been proven, but it all makes sense and it’s the best possible explanation. If a better one comes along then I will fervently preach it, but for now, because the likelihood of science being right is so high, I’m going to take it’s laws as true. Religion is wrong. Do I know that with 100% certainty? No. But I know that religion doesn’t make sense and contradicts everything that does.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe gravity isn’t true, but there is so much supporting it I’ll accept it as an absolute truth.</p>
<p>Also, Religion enforced that the earth was flat.</p>
<p>People have put a barrier in their mind between science and religion. One is evidence and logic and the other is tradition and faith. They tell themselves that the two intertwine and work together, but if they knocked down that barrier and truly eliminated all faith from their thoughts, they would find that science smashes their comforting bubble of god to pieces. If you truly apply the ideas of logic reason and evidence to religion and block out your faith for just one moment, you will find the world is very different than you have imagined.</p>

<p>Wow, this thread full of Christian flamebaiting, I don’t know why I bother to post this.</p>
<p>As for the original poster’s request, you want evidence that God exists?  As a Christian, I can say that there is no proof that He does exist.  If there was solid, 100% undeniable proof that He did, then it wouldn’t be faith now would it? So I don’t think that there ever will be proof.</p>
<p>Also, it is sad to see someone lose their faith.  I’ll pray that you’ll find it again someday  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It’s pretty tiresome seeing people make up what I said in the OP. I didn’t say <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> about the existence of god, I said about the Eucharistic Miracles. Jesus.</p>
<p>Also, if I lost my faith, I lost for a reason. I find it insulting when people say they’re sorry about it, or they’re sad that it happened. I’m glad: it’s my ‘soul’, it’s my happiness: leave me be.</p>

<p>Scientists do every day. Brane Theory? M-theory? Right now if you went to the store and looked at the magazines, the science ones are especially touting the brane multiverse theory.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">No one has ever said these have been proven, because there’s no <span class="bbcode-u">evidence</span>. That’s why it’s difference, it’s matter of thought and discussion, not blind acceptance.</span></p>
<p>God isn’t an assumption. If it were I would totally agree with you. Rather, God is the conclusion based on observation.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I actually laughed out loud at this one. I know you’re going to get all high-and-mighty at this and ask me “well, how isn’t he?” but this doesn’t even deserve an answer.</span></p>
<p>Even if its many occurrences of chance, in the end its still chance.<br>
Microevolution where species adapt and change is totally legit. Evolution happens, but not on such a scale as to explain phenomenon as the Cambrian explosion.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Man, you should be a comedian: this is a laugh a minute! Oh, <span class="bbcode-u">of course</span>! Micro-evolution, that’s fine! Makes sense because species can adapt and change <span class="bbcode-u">to their conditions</span>, but there’s no way it can happen, oh, I don’t know, over and over due to changing conditions! That’d be <span class="bbcode-u">crazy</span>!</span></p>
<p>I didnt say there’s no evidence or observation. Thats the starting point. The stuff around us. Howd it get there? Evidence of design? You start with observation.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How can you work out how everything got here if you need to look back to a point where there was nothing? Just because you can’t work out what happened before the Big Bang doesn’t mean that religion automatically makes sense. Also, I and many others have observed a hell of a lot, and I still see no evidence of design. How about a hallmark, a logo, or maybe a little signature?</span></p>
<p>A deity is a potential cause.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So is my arse, but that doesn’t mean it’s probable.</span></p>
<p>I didnt mention the well what caused God part, cause I thought it was silly.<br>
Of course nothing caused God. If something did, fine call that thing God instead.</p>
<p>[b]Oh, man, this got the most laughs yet. Hahaha, yes, <span class="bbcode-u">that</span> argument is <span class="bbcode-u">silly</span>! Something really complex, like the universe, <span class="bbcode-u">had</span> to have a creator because it’s so complex. Why’d he make it? Oh, we can’t know, he’s too complex.</p>
<p>Oh, yep, perfect sense. Certainly no recursive nonsense in <span class="bbcode-u">that</span> argument.</p>
<p>Complexity = creator, in your argument. Complex universe &lt;- Complex God &lt;- Complex ??? &lt;- Complex ??? etc. I’m sure you’re argument is that “it’s silly.” Well, hat’s off to you, sir, you should be in Mensa.[/b]</p>
<p>It attempts to prove that certain things couldn’t have evolved. That has nothing to do with evolution? Does anybody claim to know how the eyeball evolved?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">This has already been answered very well, so I’ll leave it here.</span></p>
<p>Woah man. What do you mean there is no proof? Psalm 19.<br>
1 The heavens declare the glory of God;<br>
the skies proclaim the work of his hands.<br>
2 Day after day they pour forth speech;<br>
night after night they display knowledge.<br>
3 There is no speech or language<br>
where their voice is not heard.<br>
4 Their voice goes out into all the earth,<br>
their words to the ends of the world.</p>
<p>God has made himself known in His creation such that no man is without excuse. Natural Man rebels and turns from him.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Look up the word proof. You seriously need to.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Knowledge can be discovered by science, but science can also be wrong. Science can and does point to a creator, namely God.</li>
</ol>
<p>[b]Yeah, science can be wrong. No-one says otherwise. There have been so many scientific theories that have been removed or revised over the years that this point is just… Ugh.</p>
<p>And no, it doesn’t do anything of the sort.[/b]</p>

<p>They try to find evidence of this in a natural world.<br>
God is a supernatural being, and true as far as we know you cant do a test on natural things and have a supernatural outcome. There’s no litmus test for God. You won’t find God doing natural tests, but you will find indications of God and evidences of God’s handiwork.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Again, look up proof, look up evidence.</span></p>
<p>My point was that you don’t assume God and conclude something else. You look at the evidence, a complex organism perhaps, and conclude that such an organism could not evolved through natural processes because information can not arise form natural events. This gives evidence for God, you don’t start with God as the assumption.<br>
The problem is that we don’t know everything about the world, and this isn’t conclusive. As far as we know currently, the only reasonable explanation for how information could arise is through a supernatural force. Chance can’t create meaning. Meaning comes through intention and design only.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This is such a load of crap. You’re making this utterly ridiculous “watchmaker” argument, aren’t you? Yeah, you can get “information” out of chance if the event reoccurs enough. That’s what chance is all about.</span></p>
<p>What we have is long bursts of time with no evolution, and then explosions of evolution. Not like the tree of life where there are gradual evolution happening, but millions of years of nothing, and then within a very short time-span thousands of new species. <span class="bbcode-u">These bursts are currently unexplainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I know I’ve already answer, as have others, but, come on, really? You actually made that point with a straight face?</span></p>
<p>The scientific arguments for God, as opposed to the logical arguments for God, come from the evidence of the beauty around us.<br>
The world. The universe. Matter. Beings. All points to a creator. How did matter get here. How did stuff arise. We know there was a point in time where there was nothing, and then there was something. Something beautiful. Something that follows orderly laws. Where we can discover the characteristics of God by the things he has made. The evidence is simply things exist.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">That. Isn’t. Evidence.</span></p>

<p>I steadfastly disagree and I’m an atheist.  Let’s take it down to variables for simplicity’s sake.</p>
<p>Science deals with X and only X.<br>
Religion deals with Y and only Y.</p>
<p>Religious scientists, in their job, deal with X.  Religious scientists, in their personal life, deal with Y.  They know that they cannot test Y because their tests come from X.  Y is not science.  They know that.  So, in matters of science, they deal exclusively with X.  A scientist can test the makeup of the universe and still believe a god had its hand in doing so.</p>
<p>I don’t buy it for one second, though.  If Y had something to do with X, it would leave a mark on X and testing and observing in X would reveal that mark.  In thousands of years, we haven’t seen a single thing from Y that cannot be fully explained inside the realm of X.</p>
<p>That’s also not to say that there are some nonscientists who want to inject Y into X.[/SIZE]</p>

<p>Sorry if it’s confusing.  I’m trying to remove any values-judgments.  Yes, Y is most likely wrong (as I’ve stated before).  However, religious faith is about unprovable things and most definitely are not science.  That’s not to say that it has to be either/or.  You don’t give up science because you’re religious and you don’t give up religion because you’re a scientist.</p>

<p>Yes, science can be wrong, but the current state of science is always based on the best conclusions that have been made from the current available evidence. Faith is based on indoctrination and millennium-old books.<br>
How does science point to a creator?<br>
If anything, a god by its very nature is opposite to what science is supposed to be.<br>
Science tries to explain things; it tries to find the origin and reason of things.<br>
God is inexplicable, and has no reason or origin. It’s just another way of man trying to stop the old infinite question of “if x creates y, what created x?” which has been shown to be unnecessary in the first place from what I understand is the current accepted theory of the universe.</p>

<p>So, I am a math and science guy. I really love science, and especially physics. Its not like when I don’t know something I just say, ‘well God must have done it’ when science can’t figure it out. Rather it is a motivation. We have discovered how God has made gravity to work, and the strong nuclear force to work, and all the natural laws. Then we see quantum weirdness, and I want to know what miraculous thing God has created. What is this mystery yet to be discovered? God isn’t a fallback, its a motivation.</p>

<p>Actually, yes.  Many people.  Just because YOU may not know doesn’t mean that NO ONE knows how it happened.</p>
<p>Here are just a couple of links from the FIRST PAGE ON GOOGLE:<br>
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html</a><br>

<p>Then they go on to misquote Darwin (as if proving Darwin wrong does a thing to proving evolution wrong) when they say he said, “To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.”</p>
<p>Had they continued the quote, they would’ve blown their case right out of the water:</p>
<p>“To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. When it was first said that the sun stood still and the world turned round, the common sense of mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of Vox populi, vox Dei, as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in science. Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each grade being useful to its possessor, as is certainly the case; if further, the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited, as is likewise certainly the case; and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest organisms in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed with this special sensibility.”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I wasn’t claiming that no one knew how the eye evolved. I didn’t know the eye example meant anything significant. If it could be shown that it could have evolved, then yes it is plausible that it could have evolved. No argument.</p>

<p>Don’t make a claim when you don’t know what the facts are. That’s what this book is. Its science through and through. Most of it so deep its completely over my head. What’s the test? You want a test right? The test is do current models produce the intended results. The conclusion is, with all the science you could ever want proving it, no.<br>
Remember what we’re trying to do. We’ve already established that you can’t prove God exists through scientific method. Why not? Because the scientific method only applies to natural things. You can’t do a test on matter and find anything other than matter. What these people are doing is proving the effects of creation. Proving that all this could not exist without divine intervention. This example for instance, the Signature in the Cell, looks to scientifically prove that current models of evolution do not explain the information we see in the cell. It posits that the only working model is that of a divine intelligence.<br>

<p>Is it wrong to teach something? If I truly did have the key to salvation, would it be moral to keep it to myself? But because we do believe that we have been given God’s Word, we believe we have a responsibility to let others know.

<p>Also, I’d like to point out something that I’ve concluded about belief, or faith. You can <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> believe in something 100%, because it’s extremely difficult to quantify something so ambiguous as faith. You can say that this chair is made of wood or that this is metal, but you’re basing your belief on something that you’ve been taught. You make an educated guess as to its nature, but in the end you can never be 100% sure. It’s exactly the same with religion. I’ve struggled with religion all my life. I’ve never (perhaps due to lack of courage) split with it entirely, but then again I’ve never fervently believed in it, again perhaps due to lack of courage. However, I think of it as a journey. Believing in something 100% is impossible, but I’ll damn well try, if only to have a better understanding of human nature and how I can better myself as a person. If I get to the end of the journey dispirited with humanity and with no faith whatsoever, then so be it, I’ll have learnt something. However, if I don’t try at all then I’ll look back on my life and see myself as a coward, someone who took someones teaching and took it at face value without exploring it and followed other people blindly.</p>
<p>I’ve always questioned religion and its effects - sometimes I agree with it, at other times I don’t, but I think of myself as someone who, having come from a religious background, can step back and look at it without bias. I’ve come to the conclusion, as many others have, that it is man’s interpretation of religion and the power that comes with so much belief that corrupts it. At its very heart, religion is a philosophy, something that will better humanity as a whole if people live by its teachings.</p>
<p>Where the whole situation gets muddled is the belief in an all-powerful God and the afterlife. People who question religion are forever looking for proof and challenging those who believe in a god to deliver something, when everyone knows that this is impossible and therefore futile.<br>
I think the real question is why is everyond so aggressive about it? What will you gain or lose by trying in vain to prove that you are right and the other person is wrong? You’re both speaking different languages.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just one note here. Do I believe in God? Yes. Do I believe Christ died to pay for my sins? Yes. Do I ever have any doubts? Occasionally, but not very often. Why at all? Because I still am a rebellious person who breaks God’s law. I still have sin as a part of me. And as long as I am on earth in this body, I’ll still be imperfect and with sin. Though of course I strive to grow closer to God every day.</p>

Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. 20 Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also. 21 But all these things they will do to you for My name’s sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.</p>
<p>DONT REPLY YET PLEASE PEOPLE. I CANT KEEP UP! IM GOING THROUGH POSTS RIGHT NOW.</p>
