<blockquote>
<p>At all religious:<br>
The world follows natural laws or axioms. Nothing can go faster than the speed of light, mass cannot be created or destroyed, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another and many many more. God contradicts these.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The existence of God would allow for miracles by definition. If God exists, then you must assume the possibility for miracles. </span></p>
<p>He can speak to you, so he is telepathic and his thoughts exceed that of the speed of light.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">If God is outside of time and space, as he is a supernatural entity, I dont see how this is a problem. He’s not in some far off reach of the universe, sending messages. He can act anywhere at any time. I don’t see how this advances the conversation.</span></p>
<p>We can’t find him so he probably isn’t matter but if he isn’t matter then what is he?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Of course he’s not matter. He is not of the creation. He is not a big one of us floating out there somewhere. He is supernatural. Outside of nature. Not part of the creation.</span></p>
<p>If he created the universe, then he created matter and energy, how does he create matter and energy?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Creation is a supernatural event, which as you explain is not something that we know to happen through natural causes.</span></p>
<p>He sends you to Hell or Heaven. Where is Heaven and Hell? Are they some far away planets? If they are then where are they? How do you get to them?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Nope, well as far as we know. These bodies we live in will never travel to heaven or hell. We will receive new bodies, we are told. No, it doesn’t make sense that heaven or hell would be places within the universe. I suppose maybe, but we’re not told that. If I were to guess I would say these are outside the universe, but that’s not just a religious belief, just a mental pondering. I guess I’m rambling here, but a religious reason why heaven isn’t in the universe is because there is no sin in heaven.</span></p>
<p>What is God? Is he matter? Then what elements are he made of? How do the compounds he is made of give him the power to do what he does? If he isn’t matter, then what is he and how does he affect our universe?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Again he isn’t matter. He isn’t physical. Okay yes the Word became flesh. Maybe this is what you’re getting at. The trinity concept is important here. There’s the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is a weird one and we don’t know precisely how this works. The Son (previously the Word) became flesh. Jesus, in a physical, 100% man body, existed and died yes. okay, if you want me to talk more on the Trinity and who then is Jesus let me know, but I have a feeling you don’t. Bottom line is God is not limited by physical constraints.</span></p>
<p>How does he make our universe?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">He spoke. That’s about all I can say. Do you expect me to have an answer for this? All I can say is not through physical means.</span></p>
<p>If he made us in his image then why are we corrupt?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Here’s a good question. Why does evil exist. Why are we sinful. I have written extensive works on this. If you want me to spend a couple paragraphs answering this one too I’d be glad too. It’s really hard to answer this one unless you have a good understanding of basic Christian beliefs already. Id have to do quite a bit of explaining how God works. If you want me too, I will.</span></p>
<p>Why aren’t we telepathic? Why can’t we create matter? Why aren’t we all-knowing? How is he all-knowing? <span class="bbcode-b">Cause we’re the creation, we can’t create. Why does God know everything, cause he made everything.</span></p>
<p>Science states that everything follows natural logical laws, and as you say, god follows natural laws, yet in the above paragraphs he repeatedly breaks every single scientific natural law there is. God contradicts science so both cannot possible be true. Science and religion are mutually exclusive. Pick one.<span class="bbcode-b">If you allow for God to exist, again you have to allow for miracles. But this does not mean you can’t study science. If you’re wondering about miracles, God has the capacity to break natural laws because he is not bound by them.</span></p>

<p>You say that “information can not arise form natural events.” This is, in my view, faulty for two reasons.<br>
First, information is relative and subjective. Information is only perceived as information by a mechanism or decoder if you will that can interpret that information. From that you could conclude that what to us may seem like information, could be totally nonsensical to other beings.<br>
Take language for example. No one <span class="bbcode-i">designed</span> language, it evolved through hundreds of thousands of years, basically by chance: words and grammatical constructs that were the ‘fittest,’ i.e. the most popular and the most commonly used, survived.</p>
<p>Second, ‘information’ arises naturally all the time. Nearly every natural process, from ecosystems to star systems, are governed by ‘information.’<br>
If simple informational systems can arise naturally, why not more complex ones over time?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We agree here on virtually everything. Information is indeed relative and subjective. It does require a decoder to decipher it. It does yes only make sense to those who can interpret it. All good.<br>
Your language example I think is an example for my point. No one designed language? It was intended for one human being to talk to another. The fact that everything relies on information I think proves my point. Explain how simple informational systems can arise naturally. You just told me that information requires intelligence to understand it and to relate it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This sort of argument is faulty and stems from the perception of time inherent to all humans.<br>
Time does not work in such a way that there must be a starting point and an ending point. There was no beginning, there will be no ending. There was never nothing, there will never be nothing.</p>
<p>You could in theory go back in time until the big bang, but before that, time does not exist and therefore concepts such as a beginning are irrelevant.</p>
<p>I know I’m not explaining this very well, but I suggest you read Stephen Hawking’s A Briefer History of Time if you haven’t already. It explains these concepts concisely and understandably.<br>
I must say that Stephen Hawking believes in god and does explain how he can still fit into everything in his book, but his arguments are entirely different from yours.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We agree again. Well mostly. You say there is no beginning because before the big bang there was no time. Well current theories place the big bang at 13.5-14 billion years ago. Sure there is no time before, but however you look at it, time started. It hasn’t been around for an infinite amount of time. I think we’re off topic though. I’m not sure what we’re trying to prove at this point.<br>
It seems to me that we understand each other for the most part, at least it certainly seems that way. If you have any further questions I’d enjoy discussing them. Thanks and I’ve had a great time discussing with you Burbinator.</p>

<p>But science is the BEST set of theories on top of theories. It explains everything far better than everything else.</p>
<p>There’s a tiny chance I’m wrong and there is a god and I’m being an idiot, but that chance is so slim I’m going to dismiss it. Much of science hasn’t been proven, but it all makes sense and it’s the best possible explanation. If a better one comes along then I will fervently preach it, but for now, because the likelihood of science being right is so high, I’m going to take it’s laws as true. Religion is wrong. Do I know that with 100% certainty? No. But I know that religion doesn’t make sense and contradicts everything that does.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe gravity isn’t true, but there is so much supporting it I’ll accept it as an absolute truth.</p>
<p>Also, Religion enforced that the earth was flat.</p>
<p>People have put a barrier in their mind between science and religion. One is evidence and logic and the other is tradition and faith. They tell themselves that the two intertwine and work together, but if they knocked down that barrier and truly eliminated all faith from their thoughts, they would find that science smashes their comforting bubble of god to pieces. If you truly apply the ideas of logic reason and evidence to religion and block out your faith for just one moment, you will find the world is very different than you have imagined.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m all for science! Bring on the science! Religion and Science don’t interfere. I don’t know how else to put it really. I think we’ve already stated that science can’t prove God’s existence, and it can’t disprove God’s existence, because science doesn’t work on God.</p>

<p>And Soup, I can’t very well respond when you do it by editing the quote. I can’t hit respond. Can you in the future break it up like I have done? Thanks.</p>

Scientists do every day. Brane Theory? M-theory? Right now if you went to the store and looked at the magazines, the science ones are especially touting the brane multiverse theory.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">No one has ever said these have been proven, because there’s no evidence. That’s why it’s difference, it’s matter of thought and discussion, not blind acceptance.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">I think so too. My previous posts also indicate God can’t be proven or disproven.</span></p>
<p>God isn’t an assumption. If it were I would totally agree with you. Rather, God is the conclusion based on observation.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I actually laughed out loud at this one. I know you’re going to get all high-and-mighty at this and ask me “well, how isn’t he?” but this doesn’t even deserve an answer.</span></p>
<p>Even if its many occurrences of chance, in the end its still chance.<br>
Microevolution where species adapt and change is totally legit. Evolution happens, but not on such a scale as to explain phenomenon as the Cambrian explosion.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Man, you should be a comedian: this is a laugh a minute! Oh, of course! Micro-evolution, that’s fine! Makes sense because species can adapt and change to their conditions, but there’s no way it can happen, oh, I don’t know, over and over due to changing conditions! That’d be crazy!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">We don’t know it to. We don’t see examples of it happening today. We don’t understand how it would happen. But does this matter? If we did know this doesn’t prove or disprove God. These are just scientific musings.</span></p>
<p>I didnt say there’s no evidence or observation. Thats the starting point. The stuff around us. Howd it get there? Evidence of design? You start with observation.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How can you work out how everything got here if you need to look back to a point where there was nothing? Just because you can’t work out what happened before the Big Bang doesn’t mean that religion automatically makes sense. Also, I and many others have observed a hell of a lot, and I still see no evidence of design. How about a hallmark, a logo, or maybe a little signature?</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">I believe the beauty and simplicity is the signature. As well as the information. I want to hear back from Burb, but I don’t think yet that information can arise from chance. Data and a decoder as he called it have to arise at the same time for there to be information. I dont see how this can happen without intelligence.</span></p>
<p>A deity is a potential cause.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So is my arse, but that doesn’t mean it’s probable.</span></p>
<p>I didnt mention the well what caused God part, cause I thought it was silly.<br>
Of course nothing caused God. If something did, fine call that thing God instead.</p>
<p>[b]Oh, man, this got the most laughs yet. Hahaha, yes, that argument is silly! Something really complex, like the universe, had to have a creator because it’s so complex. Why’d he make it? Oh, we can’t know, he’s too complex.</p>
<p>Oh, yep, perfect sense. Certainly no recursive nonsense in that argument.</p>
<p>Complexity = creator, in your argument. Complex universe &lt;- Complex God &lt;- Complex ??? &lt;- Complex ??? etc. I’m sure you’re argument is that “it’s silly.” Well, hat’s off to you, sir, you should be in Mensa.[/b]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Why did God make the universe? Isaiah 43 explains simply. ‘For His own glory’. That wasn’t too complex.</span></p>
<p>It attempts to prove that certain things couldn’t have evolved. That has nothing to do with evolution? Does anybody claim to know how the eyeball evolved?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This has already been answered very well, so I’ll leave it here.</span></p>
<p>Woah man. What do you mean there is no proof? Psalm 19.<br>
1 The heavens declare the glory of God;<br>
the skies proclaim the work of his hands.<br>
2 Day after day they pour forth speech;<br>
night after night they display knowledge.<br>
3 There is no speech or language<br>
where their voice is not heard.<br>
4 Their voice goes out into all the earth,<br>
their words to the ends of the world.</p>
<p>God has made himself known in His creation such that no man is without excuse. Natural Man rebels and turns from him.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Look up the word proof. You seriously need to.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Is it a logical proof? No. I should have used the word evidence. My bad. You’re right there is no scientific proof for God.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Knowledge can be discovered by science, but science can also be wrong. Science can and does point to a creator, namely God.</li>
</ol>
<p>[b]Yeah, science can be wrong. No-one says otherwise. There have been so many scientific theories that have been removed or revised over the years that this point is just… Ugh.</p>
<p>And no, it doesn’t do anything of the sort.[/b]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Order doesn’t happen by chance. This at least you must admit. And yet through science we see an ordered world. This points to a rational creator.</span></p>
<p>Originally Posted by The_Assassin47<br>
They try to find evidence of this in a natural world.<br>
God is a supernatural being, and true as far as we know you cant do a test on natural things and have a supernatural outcome. There’s no litmus test for God. You won’t find God doing natural tests, but you will find indications of God and evidences of God’s handiwork.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Again, look up proof, look up evidence.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Again, thanks for addressing this.</span></p>
<p>My point was that you don’t assume God and conclude something else. You look at the evidence, a complex organism perhaps, and conclude that such an organism could not evolved through natural processes because information can not arise form natural events. This gives evidence for God, you don’t start with God as the assumption.<br>
The problem is that we don’t know everything about the world, and this isn’t conclusive. As far as we know currently, the only reasonable explanation for how information could arise is through a supernatural force. Chance can’t create meaning. Meaning comes through intention and design only.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This is such a load of crap. You’re making this utterly ridiculous “watchmaker” argument, aren’t you? Yeah, you can get “information” out of chance if the event reoccurs enough. That’s what chance is all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">If its just chance, it should be random. You can’t get information out of randomness.</span></p>
<p>What we have is long bursts of time with no evolution, and then explosions of evolution. Not like the tree of life where there are gradual evolution happening, but millions of years of nothing, and then within a very short time-span thousands of new species. These bursts are currently unexplainable.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I know I’ve already answer, as have others, but, come on, really? You actually made that point with a straight face?</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Again, scientific musings that don’t relate to the existence of God. We don’t understand this yet. I hope we continue to research it until we do. Again, evolution does not remove God from the picture.</span></p>
<p>The scientific arguments for God, as opposed to the logical arguments for God, come from the evidence of the beauty around us.<br>
The world. The universe. Matter. Beings. All points to a creator. How did matter get here. How did stuff arise. We know there was a point in time where there was nothing, and then there was something. Something beautiful. Something that follows orderly laws. Where we can discover the characteristics of God by the things he has made. The evidence is simply things exist.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">That. Isn’t. Evidence</span>.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">It isn’t? I’m looking at orderly things pointing to an orderly system. Chance isn’t orderly, its random.</span></p>

<p>Think about it this way:  Take letters of the alphabet.  The letters C and H have natural affinities for each other.  Words, in order to survive, must have a vowel inside them.  Throw letters on the floor.  You have no idea how many of each letter there are.</p>
<p>The first time you do it, you get nothing.  The second time you do it, you get nothing.  The 80th time you do it you get CHA.  A word.  CHA stays.  Keep going.  On the 150th time you do it, you get the the word CHURCH.  Another word.  Keep at it.  Oh, look, you got CHEECH.  Sure, it’s a proper name and wouldn’t be allowed in Scrabble, but it’s still a word.</p>
<p>Eventually, you’re going to have MANY words in your possession.</p>
<p>Now, expand this out to other letters.  S and H have natural affinities.  Y can be considered a consonant or vowel.  Q can only bind with U.  And so on.  Affinities occur in nature all the time.</p>
<p>Quickly, after hundreds of generations of throwing these letters on the floor, you start forming actual words BY ACCIDENT.</p>
<p>Eventually, some words bind with other words.</p>
<p>After 600-1000 generations, throw what you’ve got on the ground.   “PREPARE FOR UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES”  What did you just do?  You created a sentence with meaning.  By accident.</p>
<p>What happens to all the possible English words such as FLOOBLE which have no meaning?  They’re ugly and don’t get a date to the prom.  They die, alone, with 50 cats in their house.  These words do not survive or produce offspring.</p>

<p>Oh how I wish you would…</p>
<p>Just a point but I’ve never had a Christian give a decent answer to this.</p>
<p>There’s a story in the Bible about a man who’s bald, these children start mocking him because of it. God sends two female bears down to kill these children. Why on earth would anyone argue that the God in these stories is a nice guy? That he loves us? 42 children die in the story because they bullied someone for being bald.</p>
<p>Assuming you believe that God is Jesus, Jesus is God, this doesn’t sound so much in the spirit as the “Father forgive them, for they know not what they do” stuff. He is a rather inconsistent man.</p>

<p>Which excuses the killing of children?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thanks Quintix. I’ll add a little bit more for context and all. So you have two men, Elijah and Elisha. This passage and the passage before it discuss the transition from Elijah who was the head prophet, to Elisha who was to be the next head prophet. The people still want Elijah, but Elisha is called to be the new prophet, and Elijah is taken up to God in the chariots of fire story.<br>
This connects back to the point of this thread. In order for Elisha to be respected, he has to perform a sign in order to prove (yes prove, not evidence this time.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  This is how prophets were proven) that he was indeed the next prophet and not some liar. So he lifts the curse on the water that Joshua had placed on it. As he leaves the city, the youths you’re talkin about say ‘Go on up [to God] you baldhead!’<br>
The point isn’t that they are teasing him for being bald, its an insult that was aimed ultimately at the God whom he represented. Elisha’s prophetic ministry was in jeapordy, the people need to respect him as the prophet of God. The sudden arrival of the two bears who mauled the 42 youths to death would serve as both an awful sentence on unbelievers and a widespread reminder that blasphemy against God and his prophet would be met with swift and certain consequences. These two miracles secure Elisha’s succession to Elijah as God’s chief prophet. Well now you know.<br>
Does this mean we should throw anyone who mocks God to the bears? No of course not. God had commanded that his messangers were to be approached with reverence and without mockery or abuse. And God is just according to His Word.</p>

          <p>All of your retorts to my point were either non-committal vagueness or about your stupid watchmaker argument.</p>
<p>Like danielsangeo has said, it’s so, so easy to create “information” using chance. Like I said, it’s the nature of chance to produce something we can interpret as information.</p>
<p>By the way, what is it you mean by “information”? Are you talking about DNA, or what?</p>
<p>Also, there is plenty of evidence for evolution. Not logic, not reasons, but proof. Viruses and bacteria evolve all the time. We’ve also witnessed the evolution of all kinds of animals: insects, birds etc. There is <span class="bbcode-i">evidence</span> for it happening.</p>
<p>It’s pure, beautiful logic.</p>
<p>If a creature has offspring that are slightly different, and it has offspring itself that are also slightly different, it’s not hard to believe that after a significant number of offspring down the line the end result could easily be wildly different. If there are certain changes in conditions (say temperature, surroundings, other wildlife) then certain changes will mean that some types of this creature will die off quicker than others. These other ones will thrive more, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>It’s just logic. I don’t see why you’d even contradict it, plenty of Popes have supported evolution for god’s sake. It doesn’t go against the bible, it makes sense and it happens all the time.</p>
<p>There’s absolutely no reason to deny it.</p>

<p>Look in a mirror.</p>
<p>Alternatively, watch this Youtube video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcAq9bmCeR0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcAq9bmCeR0</a></p>
<p>Think about it this way: Take letters of the alphabet. The letters C and H have natural affinities for each other. Words, in order to survive, must have a vowel inside them. Throw letters on the floor. You have no idea how many of each letter there are.</p>
<p>The first time you do it, you get nothing. The second time you do it, you get nothing. The 80th time you do it you get CHA. A word. CHA stays. Keep going. On the 150th time you do it, you get the the word CHURCH. Another word. Keep at it. Oh, look, you got CHEECH. Sure, it’s a proper name and wouldn’t be allowed in Scrabble, but it’s still a word.</p>
<p>Eventually, you’re going to have MANY words in your possession.</p>
<p>Now, expand this out to other letters. S and H have natural affinities. Y can be considered a consonant or vowel. Q can only bind with U. And so on. Affinities occur in nature all the time.</p>
<p>Quickly, after hundreds of generations of throwing these letters on the floor, you start forming actual words BY ACCIDENT.</p>
<p>Eventually, some words bind with other words.</p>
<p>After 600-1000 generations, throw what you’ve got on the ground. “PREPARE FOR UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES” What did you just do? You created a sentence with meaning. By accident.</p>
<p>What happens to all the possible English words such as FLOOBLE which have no meaning? They’re ugly and don’t get a date to the prom. They die, alone, with 50 cats in their house. These words do not survive or produce offspring.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A fun video. But here’s the problem. Youre going backwards here. You’re trying to make a clock, or you’re trying to make a sentence. Before you do, these things don’t exist. When you start, CHURCH has no more meaning than FLOOBLE. Its the same. Its not information. You need to have a system before you can information. You can’t work toward a function before you have a function. He orders them by how close they are to a working clock, but without him this wouldn’t make sense. Before a clock exists, this is impossible.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">EDIT: In light of recent posts, I’m not going to muse upon evolution anymore. It is being argued that it disproves religion. My questioning it is being connected to Christianity. If you want to make a different thread on the current evolutionary models, that is fine. But here it is off topic.</span></p>
