<blockquote>
<p>why not worship the sun?</p>

</aside>
<p>That would actually make more sense than worshipping God. The sun and the benefits it gives us are visible almost every day, which according to one of my favourite comedians “kind of helps the credibility along”.</p>
<p>In fact, as far as I know, most religious myths about an iconic figure being born on December 25th by a virgin maiden and later killed and ressurrected after 3 days are an astrologic metaphor for winter solstice. As can, for instance, be read <a href="https://paganizingfaithofyeshua.netfirms.com/birthday_of_son_of_sun_of_god.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p>You said religions back charities and do good, so made a counter argument, it’s what we do. I didn’t say it was representative of all religions.</p>
<p>I picked out Catholicism as it’s one of the religions that has massive weight in the realm of charity, often in a negative way: one of the reasons why the US Presidential Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief excludes anyone involved with sex workers.</p>

<p>“[AIDS is] a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems.”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I hate to admit it, but the Pope is right on this one. Surely AIDS can be prevented from spreading by use of condoms, but it will never disappear. And not every condom is entirely safe to use. Only a change in attitude towards with whom to have sex and under what circumstances can lead to a major blow against AIDS. People need to learn not to fuck around with just anybody, but to get to know their sex partners first, to earn their trust and find out if they are trustworthy - and, ultimately, to test their own and their partner’s health before indulging in sexual activities. That requires a massive rethinking of how to handle sexual relationships, and it requires it from everybody. Money and condoms alone can only try to keep the disease under control. But they will not achieve victory over AIDS.</p>

<p>I hate to admit it, but the Pope is right on this one. Surely AIDS can be prevented from spreading by use of condoms, but it will never disappear. And not every condom is entirely safe to use. Only a change in attitude towards with whom to have sex and under what circumstances can lead to a major blow against AIDS. People need to learn not to fuck around with just anybody, but to get to know their sex partners first, to earn their trust and find out if they are trustworthy - and, ultimately, to test their own and their partner’s health before indulging in sexual activities. That requires a massive rethinking of how to handle sexual relationships, and it requires it from everybody. Money and condoms alone can only try to keep the disease under control. But they will not achieve victory over AIDS.</p>

          <p>So, rounding this up because I don’t see me responding further to this thread (it’s gotten rather tangential):</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s no evidence for God because there can’t be.</li>
<li>If God does interact with our reality, then there must be a mark extant in our reality; something that we can test.  To date, no “mark” has ever been put forth*.</li>
<li>Religion can be a good thing or a bad thing.  It can make corrupt people more corrupt if they feel that they’re right and that God is on their side.  It can make corrupt people less corrupt if they feel they might not be right and God will punish them for their misdeeds.  It can make good people less good if their God says that they should involve themselves in places where they aren’t wanted (“But it’s for your own good!” is arrogant.)  It can make good people even better…for obvious reasons.  There is no evidence, however, that people that do not ascribe to your personal religion are necessarily “good” or “bad”.  And…</li>
<li>God is a slippery minx, isn’t he?  When you can’t find him, just change his characteristics into something that has been shown to exist (Big Bang, light, love, etc).</li>
</ol>
<p>If anyone wants to respond to this, I’ll be willing to converse.  Otherwise, I’ll see you in the funny papers…er, I mean…another thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>No, the Bible isn’t a “mark” any more than “Star Wars” is evidence of the Force.[/SIZE]</li>

<p>If you’re looking for proof of God you’re not going to find it. That’s pretty much the whole point of religion, that there is no proof. Yes it’s flawed, yes it’s illogical, yes you get some retards who take the wrong meanings from it or get brainwashed and fuck things up for the rest of us, but in my experience religious people are generally normal - nice, pleasant, normal people.</p>

</aside>
<p>Your experience of how religious people treat atheists is far different than mine. I’ve never asked for proof ( or if I did I misspoke ). What I’m looking for is any sort of REAL evidence that can be tangibly tied to any religion, which would lead a reasonable person that basis their beliefs off of logical method thinking to consider ANY religion more credible than any other imaginary/fictitious conjuring.</p>

<p>I personally use my own analogy of sports fans. There are millions of people who watch football all over the world. Some follow their own teams avidly, who never miss a game and who wear their team’s clothes when they go out. Others watch it simply because there’s nothing else on, but you can’t assume that they’re all the same. I think what many people fall into the trap of is that they assume that people who follow a religion follow it flawlessly, and that they take those beliefs blindly and follow them to the letter without thinking it through. Utter bollocks. One of my best friends is a scottish former rugby-playing nutcase who has taken huge amounts of drugs and has had some pretty hilarious and scary sexual encounters in his time, and yet through and above all that he’s a Christian. Fuck knows why but he is. I wonder whether his faith has any effect on his life at all, or whether he’d be any different without it, but you absolutely <span class="bbcode-i">cannot</span> assume that he’s a perfect person and then criticise him for not showing any proof.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The problem with this analogy is that sports fans are not required to do act say or think anything. It’s an open personal choice that isn’t dictated by any set doctrine. At best you have social pressures. Social pressure is a different beast though when not backed up by concrete ‘rules of conduct’.</p>

<p>Now when someone who follows a religion and chastises you for not following God, or outrightly says that you are wrong, you are, I feel, morally entitled to defend yourself and debate about the existence of God and how there is no proof. However, what I’ve seen many people do is repeatedly challenge, and aggressively so, the existence of God and attack the supposedly small and weak-minded individual who follows him, and that is pretty much doing the opposite of those who attack others for <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> believing in God. I’m not saying that anyone in particular is doing that here, but it’s so easy to get carried away and become overly aggressive.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how that would be a way to deal with a reasonable person, but rather a person of weak mind willing to take persuasive sweet talk as truth.

<p>Christianity is an ideal – you are only a perfect Christian if you treat others how you would like to be treated and to love your neighbour as yourself, which is inherently impossible. Therefore the way I see it is that people are always people and only ever will be that. You can say that some are Christians, but that is no more valid or correct than saying someone is black. You can argue that someone is black of course, but first and foremost they are a person. You can’t assume anything about them until you know them. You can’t assume that they are weak-minded blundering sheep any more than you can assume that everyone from Afghanistan is a terrorist.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What confuses me is why religious texts can be totally ignored in some of the critical areas, while it’s still okay to accept the whole as something to base a faith system on. In Genesis of the christian text the god figure shows himself to be a liar ( or at best a deceiver ) and an unjust deity. This image in the later texts totally changes this. How can that happen? Is THIS what I’m supposed to accept as the word of an infallible being?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I’m looking for is any sort of REAL evidence that can be tangibly tied to any religion, which would lead a reasonable person that basis their beliefs off of logical method thinking to consider ANY religion more credible than any other imaginary/fictitious conjuring.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s a pretty hard question to answer, and anything I write here will inevitably fall short of doing it justice. The short answer is that I personally don’t know why I believe in God. However, whether it is due to twisting of logic or beliefs or not, science and religion can coexist. There’s nothing that I’ve learnt that disproves the existence of God and there will never be. As I said before, I find it hard to believe in an all-powerful being, but the teachings of religion I find very easy to believe and support. I suppose my belief in God, however small, stems from the concept of morality.<br>
Personally, and as far as I know this isn’t a religious teaching, I like to think that morality is something that has been given to humanity through evolution. Our concepts of right and wrong are what make our lives worth living. For me, there seems to be a reason why acts of spontaneous generosity and kindness leave you feeling good. If you give money to charity or do something kind to a complete stranger, even just smiling at them, you feel good about yourself. It sounds soppy, sentimental and naive perhaps, but if a complete stranger smiles at you it is something you’ll remember for a long time. Why is it that humans feel such strong emotions and have such a powerful and overriding awareness of right and wrong, even in situations we couldn’t possibly predict?<br>
The answer is that we were taught it, but that is only part of it. What Jesus taught and the things that he spoke of (the first will be last and the last will be first, whoever is humble shall be raised up, love your enemies, forgive not just seven times but seventy times seventy seven) were illogical, almost paradoxical, but make perfect sense when looked closely at. The Jewish laws of an eye for an eye are really just human nature, and in the words of Ghandi make everyone blind. Jesus said that he didn’t come to rewrite the law but to complete it, implying that human logic is flawed. What he taught makes sense to us in hindsight, but it doesn’t make sense naturally - if you love your enemy and forgive endlessly then you’re inevitably going to be screwed over several times, but that’s simply looking at yourself and on a very small scale.<br>
Where human logic is flawed is that we simply look out for ourselves and those we love - that’s the logical and sound solution. There are a lot of dangerous people in the world and why should we risk our health and happiness to please them when we have our friends and loved ones to look out for? However, the illogical teaching of Jesus is that we should lead by example and love our neighbours as ourselves, thinking of humanity as a whole rather than on a personal level, and I respect that.<br>
For me, part of the reason why I believe that Jesus was from God is that his teachings were completely and utterly illogical superficially, but also revolutionary. Ultimately, even if there is no God and Jesus was merely a philosopher, his teachings still make sense and I am happy to do my best to follow them. I’ll fail countless times, but going to church reminds me of them and keeps my morale up. There’s a lot I don’t understand and don’t agree with, but that’s life - you learn.<br>
I’m sure this won’t satisfy you, but that’s my own personal opinion.</p>

<p>I didn’t mean to imply that you personally were being aggressive, but often that seems the case on the internet - that people know there’s no way you can respond with violence so words are the only tool available. They say what’s on their mind, but they can do it overly aggressively and often without meaning to. I agree with you about religious wars - religion is a powerful tool and can be used dispicably. There have been countless cases of unanswerable evil done in the name of religion in the world’s history. I won’t defend it, but who’s to say that those sorts of things wouldn’t have happened, or what the world would have turned out like without religion? There’s always going to be a cause worth fighting and dying for, and people will inevitably be deceived and taken advantage of. If it wasn’t for a God that they fought for then it would have been for a king or out of fear of something.</p>

<p>I agree, but then you have faith. If there was unrefutable evidence somewhere, then there would be no point in faith at all. It’s a catch 22 I know. Some people say that they encounter God when they feel overwhelming joy in praise or being kind to people - I personally haven’t felt that sort of joy in a long time, nor do I feel comfortable praising something I can’t see, but I’ve certainly encountered it. The problem is that whatever ‘evidence’ that people give for their belief in God can also be explained as coincidence. Catch 22 again.</p>

<p>What confuses me is why religious texts can be totally ignored in some of the critical areas, while it’s still okay to accept the whole as something to base a faith system on.

Is THIS what I’m supposed to accept as the word of an infallible being?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s a very good question and something which I can’t reply to as I’m looking for the same answer. Some people will try and defend God, but that’s something I can’t agree with because, by the very nature of itself, God’s ways are not ours. Perhaps it’s simply a metaphor, perhaps not. Out of curiosity, which example were you thinking of when God shows himself to be a liar or deceiver? This is probably where most people find it impossible to follow God - they get hung up on the Bible which is something that I don’t entirely agree with or understand, nor do I pretend to.</p>

</aside>
<p>Of course, every day. I question myself a lot, wondering whether the reason I follow a religion is because I’m too scared to give it up? It’s still a possibility. However, I went for three years without going to church, where I might not have rejected God per se, as I still agree with Jesus’ teachings, but I certainly didn’t count myself as a Christian and I didn’t follow any teaching. The experience was inconclusive to be honest - I slept around and drank a lot in my first year of uni, but that didn’t make me happy. I’m not saying that only God can bring happiness or that happiness can’t come from leading a normal life without God, but I simply find that I’m a moral person.</p>

<p>I would argue that they don’t understand - they believe in Father Christmas because they want to and because their brains haven’t developed fully to look at the evidence for and against and come to a conclusion. The exact same can be said of religious believers I know, but perhaps their belief comes from something altogether more philosophical and human, through emotions they feel and the kindness they encounter in others. A child will believe in a mythical being who comes down chimneys because they find presents in the morning and because their parents say so, but they’re basing that off different things to what a Muslim might or a Christian.<br>
There you have physical evidence and strong support from a more knowledgable person than yourself. A religious belief is based on more intangible proof - evidence that will only be evidence to the person themselves - catch 22 again. It’s strong proof to the individual though, hence why two thirds of our world’s population follow a religion.</p>

<p>[/QUOTE]<br>
You won’t find one. I don’t like the idea of religion being based on something that isn’t evidence. As I said before, my belief is more in the human spirit and our concepts of morality. The lack of physical evidence of God is something that makes me uncomfortable, but the whole basis for this topic is that believers believe something that you can’t comprehend. I’m not saying they are more intelligent that you or me (I can’t comprehend it either), but it is impossible for you to understand the sort of emotion that goes with religion at the moment. If you have ever felt it, then you would most likely dismiss it with a psychological reason that could never have come from God - I see it as a psychological reason as well, but I also see no fault with God’s ways being interpreted by science. If it has a scientific explanation it doesn’t immediately make it man-made or anonymous, just as evolution can be seen as God’s detailed construction - catch 22. You’ll just say that I’m on the other camp, refusing to think of anything as <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> being from God - but that’s where you and I differ. You <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> an explanation. I do too, but I can accept one without physical evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you choose to be a Christian or i.e. you were raised in a Christian family and had no choice?<br>
Raised a Christian. There was a period of three years where I chose not to be.</p>
<p>If you’re Christian then you think that other religions are wrong. Does that make them evil? Why do you think that Christianity is right and other religions are wrong? Can you disprove them?<br>
[COLOR=‘royalblue’]I try not to think of other religions as being right or wrong - the majority of them believe in the same God and all of them, as far as I’m aware, are morally sound. Perhaps a better word for them is incomplete perhaps? But I hope that doesn’t make me sound short-sighted and dismissive. If you agreed with them then there’d be no point in following a single religion to be honest. That in no way makes them evil, I would never think that. I think there’s a collossal amount that religions and denominations can learn from each other. I can’t disprove them though.</p>
<p>What if someone is good but professes some other religion? Will he go to heaven or hell?<br>
[COLOR=‘royalblue’]I was told by a nun once that hell is a misunderstood concept, that hell is only for those who fully reject God and his teachings. In other words if you don’t love anyone. That doesn’t make her automatically right, but it makes sense to me. Having a heaven and hell conjures up a concept of being immediately right or wrong. If you’re an atheist then there is no rejection of God personally because you don’t believe in him. If you’re generally a good person as I’ve seen most people to be, then you’re half way there whether you know or believe it or not. Even when you get something that is seen as a sin by religion, such as homosexuality, they teach to love the sinner but hate the sin. Personally I don’t enjoy the act of homosexuality and I doubt many people here do - I wouldn’t like to be arse raped or to kiss a man, but I still get on with gay people. It sounds like a cliche when someone says one of my best friends is gay/black/etc. It’s true though - there’s a difference.</p>
<p>Why do you go to church? If God is omnipresent then it doesn’t matter where you are.<br>
[COLOR=‘royalblue’]Going to church is more about remaining faithful to a teaching, plus you can interact with like-minded people. If you don’t go then you will inevitably neglect the teachings or worse, draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p>Do you confess? If so, then why are you doing it? The bible doesn’t say you should.<br>
[COLOR=‘royalblue’]Jesus preached forgiveness, the Church follows his teachings. He said that any sin is forgiveable, but I suppose it’s more for ease of mind and conscience than anything else.</p>
<p>Do you hate other religions?<br>
[COLOR=‘royalblue’]Nope. I wish there was more cooperation or talks between them, but I doubt that will happen.</p>
<p>What happens to people that didn’t have a chance to profess Christianity (i. e. primitive tribes all around the world excluded from society)? Will they be condemned?<br>
[COLOR=‘royalblue’]What there’s a lot of in this topic is people answering questions as though they have authority. I’m probably guilty of that myself but I’m sure you won’t take everything I say as the be all and end all. Personally I don’t know the answer to this question, but it wouldn’t make sense to me for them to be condemned. Perhaps they have their own test, I don’t know. It’s like judging a child who dies as a baby - you can’t.</p>
<p>What about jehovah witnesses? According to their beliefs if you’re not professing their religion you won’t go to heaven no matter how good you are. Will they be condemned?<br>
[COLOR=‘royalblue’]Given my views on hell, I doubt anyone is there to be honest. It’s something to scare people and in a less sceptical age it would have worked. But again I don’t know - perhaps they go to pergatory, or the equivalent of it. The whole idea of pergatory is that it’s not permanent, and that you can move from one to the other.</p>
<p>EDIT: Looking at the past, religions (including Christianity) has caused countless wars and millions of innocent people died because of it. What do you think about that? Does that make religion evil?<br>
[COLOR=‘royalblue’]I can’t condone that, nor deny that religion can be a powerful tool for evil. I don’t think that makes religion evil though. I wrote something in more detail for Max’s reply.</p>
<p>If God created us and he’s omniscient isn’t it his fault that we commit sins? He knew that we’ll commit them even before he created us. So why did he do it?<br>
[COLOR=‘RoyalBlue’]I had a huge discussion with a few other people about this very question not so long ago. In the end it’s a bit of a paradox. But knowing that someone is going to do something isn’t the same as doing it ourselves. God might know everything but he can’t stop us from committing murder - he gave us free will so that we could choose to live good lives or not. But then again I can’t answer that question with any authority and I doubt anyone could.</p>

<p>Keresh, I haven’t said they are wrong. If you prepare a hamburger for me, I’ll eat it and probably say “This was a good meal.” But if you prepare Cordon Bleu (or whatever it’s spelled like), I’ll probably say “This is a great meal.”<br>

<p>It’s common sense, really. You may have 20 different candidates to fill the position of Teacher. The first one has 2 years of theory education and no practice.

Whom would you prefer? And how much MORE would you be willing to pay the best available teacher to get him?<br>
Christianity simply asks of us certain things, that some other religions don’t. And it simply provides answers or guidance for things that some other religions don’t. Many are not willing to pay the price Christianity asks for, many don’t need the extra answers the Christianity provides, or maybe they don’t like those answers. They rather blind themselves from the truth so that they can continue their comfortable lifestyles, perhaps, or perhaps they want to continue accumulating wealth they should share (in the “Overpopulation discussion” thread, I’ve pointed out that 90% of world wealth is exploited by 10% of population. We know this, we can measure it, but we still don’t do anything about it, still exploit the poor regions of the planet for our own “satisfaction/comfort/perversions”).</p>

<p>So people have to lead a good life and that’s it? They don’t have to do anything else and they will still be equally judged with others?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sure. The million dollar question is: How would you know if you’re leading a good life, without spiritual guidance? We’ve become so detached from nature that we have trouble dealing with things as natural as death. The bible tells you you should not fear Death, while Pharmaceutical companies live off the fear of aging and death they help create in people. And people have lost touch with nature/God, and spend enormous sums to postpone old age and death. 15 years old girls damage their facial skin by make-up, which results in their skin being old at the age of 25, forcing them to keep applying more and more make-up every day, undergo plastic surgery etc. That’s just one example how not having a spiritual guidance can result in activities that are against the will of God. But if you are able to keep living a good life, then you’ve “multiplied the money God has given you”, and God will be happy with you.</p>

<p>So if someone is participating in a mass he’s a better person than someone who preys in his home (or other places)? People decided to build churches. God didn’t tell them to do it. They could meet in any other places. Wouldn’t it be pretty much the same?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They are not automatically a better person. It’s still the same concept: Masses, prayers, confessions, Bible… they are all here mainly to remind you WHAT you SHOULD be DOING, and what you should be AVOIDING. It doesn’t give you a “carte blanche” (as some see it), in the sense “I sin, and then go to mass/confession, and I’m OK! Hooray!”. It doesn’t work like that. I’ve seen people go to Sunday morning mass, still so drunk they fell asleep there. God saw it and will undoubtedly ask the sinner “Why were you destroying your body with alcohol, when I told you to keep your body in honor and to use it for good?”<br>
You can pray at home, you can have your own house masses, the thing once again is that during the ages, the “protocol” of Mass has been polished to have a high chance of successfully invoking the spiritual stuff in humans. To cleanse their minds of stress or anger, to let them forgive others, to enlighten them with reading from the Bible, and so on…<br>
And then there’s the Eucharistia (sorry for misspelling) as well, the greatest miracle of the Church, probably.</p>

<p>God is omniscient and omnipresent, right? So if he knows our sins then why do we have to tell them to a priest? He’s not a proxy because God already knows about our sins. People could just acknowledge their sins and promise to repent. They don’t need a priest for that. He can tell you that what you did was wrong but isn’t that obvious? You have to realize that, if you’re going to confess. And once again, confession was “invented” by people not by God.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You are speaking about your sins not for God to hear it, but for yourself to hear it. To “bring the skeletons out of the closets”. The priest is an educated person who specializes in “spiritual psychology”, sort of. Not everyone is a psychologist, and also, we often have trouble to admitting the true reasons of our actions, we may try to portray our sins as lesser or “partially justified” to feel better, and the priest can help us see the real extent of our behavior.</p>

<p>I don’t know about USA, but in my country, Jehovists are a sect, not a registered church. I am not here to judge anyone. Maybe they will realize their wrongdoings early enough, maybe they will repent and god will forgive them just as he forgave the murderer on the cross next to Jesus… But once again – we don’t know everything, maybe the murderer was a simple person that got under wrong influence and was convinced that killing some people is OK, and only when he saw Jesus’s behavior and love even for those who crucified him, he realised how wrong he has been. I’m not so sure Jehovists who persuade old ladies to take a mortgage on their houses so that they can donate money to their “church”, are so simple… Just like scientologic church is basically a brainwash money tunnel from rich pockets, Jehovists do something similar (in my country at least).</p>

<p>And that’s the point, Keresh! Because of free will, no-one, not even God, knows whether or not I will now get up from my computer and go kill my wife. God knows that the probability of me doing something so horrible is 0.000000000001%, and he knows what would happen if I did (he knows what would be the probability that I would be escaping for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days… that I would commit suicide right after that crime…), but I was given free will and God created this World so that there are quite a few incentives why I shouldn’t do it – I was raised by loving people, I saw the suffering of violently dying creatures, and I am convinced that killing is wrong.<br>
Because of this, I am going to raise my children so that they avoid violence as long as possible, I am going to teach them to reason instead of to bully, to help instead of to exploit, to love instead of to hate. By doing that, I will be increasing the chances that they will not murder anyone, that they will respect others and try to help them if they can. But even my children will have free will and it may, sadly, happen that they will do something really bad, which will make both me and God very sad.</p>

<p>Consider the guidance system of a tactical missile such as Trident. It has the precision of 5 meters (let’s say). So, if you want to destroy Saddam Hussein’s palace, you aim at the center of it, and you can, at the moment of launching the missile, say that you are certain you will hit, simply because no matter in what direction the missile deviates (within its precision), the building will be hit. If you ask such guidance system where it’s gonna hit, it will tell you “Saddam’s Palace”. You wouldn’t be told which exact square inch will be hit first, but it doesn’t really matter to you.<br>
God knows all possible outcomes of all events that are subject to the free will of all his creation. Every future that can happen - God knows it. And in his endless graces, he let us, his Creation, to determine which of those futures will actually happen.

<blockquote>
<p>That’s a pretty hard question to answer, and anything I write here will inevitably fall short of doing it justice. The short answer is that I personally don’t know why I believe in God. However, whether it is due to twisting of logic or beliefs or not, science and religion can coexist. There’s nothing that I’ve learnt that disproves the existence of God and there will never be. As I said before, I find it hard to believe in an all-powerful being, but the teachings of religion I find very easy to believe and support. I suppose my belief in God, however small, stems from the concept of morality.<br>
Personally, and as far as I know this isn’t a religious teaching, I like to think that morality is something that has been given to humanity through evolution. Our concepts of right and wrong are what make our lives worth living. For me, there seems to be a reason why acts of spontaneous generosity and kindness leave you feeling good. If you give money to charity or do something kind to a complete stranger, even just smiling at them, you feel good about yourself. It sounds soppy, sentimental and naive perhaps, but if a complete stranger smiles at you it is something you’ll remember for a long time. Why is it that humans feel such strong emotions and have such a powerful and overriding awareness of right and wrong, even in situations we couldn’t possibly predict?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t feel that emotions count as much in the way of evidence. However, the ability to feel emotion, or the endorphins released when we do something good is simply a function of our brain. It’s how our minds deal with a world it is essentially detached from. If you damage the lower frontal lobe, all sense of right and wrong go out the window. Priests become immoral and violent. If emotion comes from god, then why is it so easily lost when there is small damage to a certain part of the brain?</p>

<p>The answer is that we were taught it, but that is only part of it. What Jesus taught and the things that he spoke of (the first will be last and the last will be first, whoever is humble shall be raised up, love your enemies, forgive not just seven times but seventy times seventy seven) were illogical, almost paradoxical, but make perfect sense when looked closely at. The Jewish laws of an eye for an eye are really just human nature, and in the words of Ghandi make everyone blind. Jesus said that he didn’t come to rewrite the law but to complete it, implying that human logic is flawed. What he taught makes sense to us in hindsight, but it doesn’t make sense naturally - if you love your enemy and forgive endlessly then you’re inevitably going to be screwed over several times, but that’s simply looking at yourself and on a very small scale.<br>
Where human logic is flawed is that we simply look out for ourselves and those we love - that’s the logical and sound solution. There are a lot of dangerous people in the world and why should we risk our health and happiness to please them when we have our friends and loved ones to look out for? However, the illogical teaching of Jesus is that we should lead by example and love our neighbours as ourselves, thinking of humanity as a whole rather than on a personal level, and I respect that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The concept of ‘eye for an eye’ isn’t a limitation of human logic. It’s not beyond human logic to see the benefits of avoiding violent conflict or reprisal. This isn’t something that needs to be taught, or gleaned from some sort of prophet or deity. We, as humans, are pack creatures. It is actually in our nature to accept others as part of our behavior. Violent creatures will remain in a group despite internal violence because their nature has told them that is the best chance for survival as a species. Humans still bend to this primal instinct. We moralize it based on our inherent love for our own kind. It’s not really all that mystical.</p>

<p>For me, part of the reason why I believe that Jesus was from God is that his teachings were completely and utterly illogical superficially, but also revolutionary. Ultimately, even if there is no God and Jesus was merely a philosopher, his teachings still make sense and I am happy to do my best to follow them. I’ll fail countless times, but going to church reminds me of them and keeps my morale up. There’s a lot I don’t understand and don’t agree with, but that’s life - you learn.<br>

<p>I didn’t mean to imply that you personally were being aggressive, but often that seems the case on the internet - that people know there’s no way you can respond with violence so words are the only tool available. They say what’s on their mind, but they can do it overly aggressively and often without meaning to. I agree with you about religious wars - religion is a powerful tool and can be used dispicably. There have been countless cases of unanswerable evil done in the name of religion in the world’s history. I won’t defend it, but who’s to say that those sorts of things wouldn’t have happened, or what the world would have turned out like without religion? There’s always going to be a cause worth fighting and dying for, and people will inevitably be deceived and taken advantage of. If it wasn’t for a God that they fought for then it would have been for a king or out of fear of something.</p>

<p>While there will always be some cause to fight for religion is a barrier of difference. Differences cause conflict. It is one of the more complex and wide spread differences as well. I can’t say for sure, but evidence would suggest that removing such a conflict causing barrier would have a greatly beneficial effect on world conflict. The distribution of wealth and resources is a topic for another thread. This all doesn’t even take into account the negative effect religions can have in terms of progress as a species.</p>

<p>I agree, but then you have faith. If there was unrefutable evidence somewhere, then there would be no point in faith at all. It’s a catch 22 I know. Some people say that they encounter God when they feel overwhelming joy in praise or being kind to people - I personally haven’t felt that sort of joy in a long time, nor do I feel comfortable praising something I can’t see, but I’ve certainly encountered it. The problem is that whatever ‘evidence’ that people give for their belief in God can also be explained as coincidence. Catch 22 again.</p>

<p>Your brain interprets input to define the world around it. This is true, you are human, so this can be taken as truth.

<p>That’s a very good question and something which I can’t reply to as I’m looking for the same answer. Some people will try and defend God, but that’s something I can’t agree with because, by the very nature of itself, God’s ways are not ours. Perhaps it’s simply a metaphor, perhaps not. Out of curiosity, which example were you thinking of when God shows himself to be a liar or deceiver? This is probably where most people find it impossible to follow God - they get hung up on the Bible which is something that I don’t entirely agree with or understand, nor do I pretend to.</p>

</aside>
<p>What I was referencing was the origin story. God says to Adam that he must not eat from the tree of knowledge. Adam is told that if he does he will die. Adam goes on to live for another 900 years after eating the apple. Now, you can say he didn’t lie because he did die eventually. God didn’t provide a basis for context, so it should be implied that he would die WHEN he ate the apple. Literally that moment. If it was otherwise, there needs to be context, or else it is deceptive. Some say it is because to god time is meaningless, but it’s not meaningless to Adam. I would presume god should know this. So god would still need to provide context. Some mention it being a death of spirit. However, there is no mention of this after the eating. The very concept is flawed. You tell two people who are so unaware of evil and good, that they don’t even realize they are naked ( again, I’m not sure why nudity is evil, but moving on ). How are these people being told not to eat an apple by god, but then being told by a serpent supposed to know what is right and wrong without any concept of it? Remember, before eating from the tree of knowledge they don’t even know of evil, so they wouldn’t even understand what they were doing is even wrong. What sort of cruel god punishes those who lack the capacity to understand him? That’s not really fair. We cannot please him in that sense. We still do not understand him, and by that he is always punishing us in everything we do? Damn.</p>

<p>Of course, every day. I question myself a lot, wondering whether the reason I follow a religion is because I’m too scared to give it up? It’s still a possibility. However, I went for three years without going to church, where I might not have rejected God per se, as I still agree with Jesus’ teachings, but I certainly didn’t count myself as a Christian and I didn’t follow any teaching. The experience was inconclusive to be honest - I slept around and drank a lot in my first year of uni, but that didn’t make me happy. I’m not saying that only God can bring happiness or that happiness can’t come from leading a normal life without God, but I simply find that I’m a moral person.</p>

<p>Do you believe because I don’t think religious teachings are anything but fiction, that I am immoral. Immoral, I may be, but I don’t think it’s because I’m not religious. Happiness is something difficult. I find happiness in seeing my little girl. This has nothing to do with religion or beliefs. I just relish in the little person who is made from a part of me. Caring for her makes me happy. People find happiness in many different ways. I love my little girl, but that doesn’t mean she is relevant to people who don’t know her. In this way I’d say religion is unrelated to happiness. Is it impossible for you to be happy without religion? That is a very upsetting thought to me. I would feel very sorry for someone who can’t be happy without religion.</p>

<p>I would argue that they don’t understand - they believe in Father Christmas because they want to and because their brains haven’t developed fully to look at the evidence for and against and come to a conclusion. The exact same can be said of religious believers I know, but perhaps their belief comes from something altogether more philosophical and human, through emotions they feel and the kindness they encounter in others. A child will believe in a mythical being who comes down chimneys because they find presents in the morning and because their parents say so, but they’re basing that off different things to what a Muslim might or a Christian.<br>
There you have physical evidence and strong support from a more knowledgable person than yourself. A religious belief is based on more intangible proof - evidence that will only be evidence to the person themselves - catch 22 again. It’s strong proof to the individual though, hence why two thirds of our world’s population follow a religion.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s not really the point though. the human mind allows there to belief of something without any prompting. Think of a child who you introduce to another person. Then that person leaves. That child will still believe that person is alive. Imagine that person dies. Without some sort of key, that child will continue to believe that person is alive. Belief without effort. This continues on in a child having imaginary friends, and making things up on their own without prompting. It’s our ability to imagine things that don’t exist without conscience effort that allows us to dominate this planet. It’s so easy it happens is we want to or not.</p>

I’m not saying they are more intelligent that you or me (I can’t comprehend it either), but it is impossible for you to understand the sort of emotion that goes with religion at the moment. If you have ever felt it, then you would most likely dismiss it with a psychological reason that could never have come from God - I see it as a psychological reason as well, but I also see no fault with God’s ways being interpreted by science. If it has a scientific explanation it doesn’t immediately make it man-made or anonymous, just as evolution can be seen as God’s detailed construction - catch 22.

<p>It’s common sense, really. You may have 20 different candidates to fill the position of Teacher. The first one has 2 years of theory education and no practice.

Christianity simply asks of us certain things, that some other religions don’t. And it simply provides answers or guidance for things that some other religions don’t. Many are not willing to pay the price Christianity asks for, many don’t need the extra answers the Christianity provides, or maybe they don’t like those answers. They rather blind themselves from the truth so that they can continue their comfortable lifestyles, perhaps, or perhaps they want to continue accumulating wealth they should share (in the “Overpopulation discussion” thread, I’ve pointed out that 90% of world wealth is exploited by 10% of population.

I find that exceedingly pompous and self righteous. Many atheist dedicate their lives and expend great self sacrifice for the betterment of the human race. They don’t follow Christianity because they don’t feel it is right, not because they don’t want to go to church on Sundays. If this is the sort of attitude that christian ‘truth’ provides.

<p>I don’t feel that emotions count as much in the way of evidence. However, the ability to feel emotion, or the endorphins released when we do something good is simply a function of our brain. It’s how our minds deal with a world it is essentially detached from. If emotion comes from god, then why is it so easily lost when there is small damage to a certain part of the brain?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“If you have ever felt it, then you would most likely dismiss it with a psychological reason that could never have come from God - I see it as a psychological reason as well, but I also see no fault with God’s ways being interpreted by science.”</span></p>
<p>I never said there is evidence. You’re the one who is looking for it, and so you should - indeed, the problems that you face with being able to look at everything in terms of fact and fiction are the very problems that I face with logic and religion. I don’t have the answers to your questions, but for me I do see emotion, especially heightened emotion that I have felt myself and seen in others, as some form of evidence of God. It’s not concrete and by no means infallible, but it’s a start for me. I’ll say again - because something has a scientific explanation or can be explained as coincidence doesn’t go to say that it is false or no longer from God. As for being damaged so easily, I see that as a side-effect of a world which isn’t perfect. I see no reason for humans to be invincible, and emotions are no different. It’s no one’s fault if you get cancer.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of ‘eye for an eye’ isn’t a limitation of human logic. It’s not beyond human logic to see the benefits of avoiding violent conflict or reprisal. This isn’t something that needs to be taught, or gleaned from some sort of prophet or deity. We, as humans, are pack creatures. It is actually in our nature to accept others as part of our behavior. Violent creatures will remain in a group despite internal violence because their nature has told them that is the best chance for survival as a species. Humans still bend to this primal instinct. We moralize it based on our inherent love for our own kind. It’s not really all that mystical.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Again, I never said that an ‘eye for an eye’ was the limitation of human logic, or even implied that. I used that as an example of typical human logic. We would have probably been able to rise above that eventually, but religion teaches those morals on a basic level. Jesus’ teachings were also very illogical, and I very much doubt whether you would get other teachers who would preach something that was so illogical and revolutionary.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>All of this seems to be relating to morality. I don’t see morality as evidence or indicator of anything beyond our functions as intelligent and reasoning beings capable of free thought.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No evidence as such, but I see it as part of the argument for me. As I said before, faith is something that is different for everyone. Religion is a deeply personal thing. Just as people have different ways of reading, working out problems etc. so they have different reasons for believing. What counts as evidence or a reason for someone won’t be the same for someone else. I don’t see much point in asking for evidence or proof from people when it’s such an ambiguous subject. That will, I’m sure, be frustrating but it’s true.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>While there will always be some cause to fight for religion is a barrier of difference. Differences cause conflict. It is one of the more complex and wide spread differences as well. I can’t say for sure, but evidence would suggest that removing such a conflict causing barrier would have a greatly beneficial effect on world conflict. The distribution of wealth and resources is a topic for another thread. This all doesn’t even take into account the negative effect religions can have in terms of progress as a species.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is really just a hypothecy - religion has always been a part of our evolution as a species, perhaps even essential. I think it’s impossible to say what the world would have been like without it. Of course it’s easy to say it would be better without when you see things such as 9/11, but what is much harder to see is how much religion really mattered in those issues. How much of it say, was looking to destroy the West and humiliate them? What is even harder to see is what the world would have been like without religion. Religion causes conflict, but I see the world as full of conflict - people will pick on <span class="bbcode-i">anyone</span>, simply because they are a different colour, of a different country, have a funny walk, have different customs and cultures, have a strange voice. There is <span class="bbcode-i">no</span> reason to think that conflict is limited to religion.<br>
As far as I’m aware, religions teach kindness and generosity, but they also warn us of the dangers of prejudice and racism. They keep these teachings at the forefront of our minds - who’s to say what the world wouldn’t be like without it? All the small, tiny, insignificant acts that people have done in the name of religion would <span class="bbcode-i">far</span> outweigh any atrocities done by a 100th of a fraction of the world’s population.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>The thing about faith that makes me uncomfortable, is that it’s thrown around so lightly. You can have faith, but it is important to consider what you have faith in, and why. It’s a personal question one should ask themselves. Does your faith deserve your faith?</p>

</aside>
<p>I think so, yes, when it is morally sound.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>Your brain interprets input to define the world around it. This is true, you are human, so this can be taken as truth.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Give an example. If you’re referring to God, taking something as true implies that you believe it. I’ve said this before - belief is something that you can’t quantify. Even something as simple as saying you believe something is metal, can you really believe it beyond <span class="bbcode-i">any</span> doubt? I don’t play with belief and faith, at a whim saying I believe this and that. Some might, but that’s their choice. It doesn’t make them wrong. I don’t think that believing in something beyond our own understanding of existence is wrong, even without concrete evidence. Besides, if you had some sort of evidence that we can relate to, wouldn’t that something beyond our existence and understanding then serve no purpose, or at best a lesser purpose? I find it hard to think that anyone would go to their deaths believing <span class="bbcode-i">absolutely</span> in God. I think at some point or other in people’s lives there has to be a gap there that they have to jump. For some people, who might think along more superstitious and less logical lines that gap might come early on in their lives and they can believe in God quite early. For others, like you and me, our logic would prevent us from making that leap, and therefore it would come at our deaths, if it comes at all. You want evidence, but you probably won’t find it to your satisfaction. There are countless others in the same boat who find it hard to follow or believe in a god. For them, I suppose the answer is that they have to follow the teachings, which make sense and are logical, and the things that they cannot follow come after you die.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>What I was referencing was the origin story. God says to Adam that he must not eat from the tree of knowledge. How are these people being told not to eat an apple by god, but then being told by a serpent supposed to know what is right and wrong without any concept of it? Remember, before eating from the tree of knowledge they don’t even know of evil, so they wouldn’t even understand what they were doing is even wrong. What sort of cruel god punishes those who lack the capacity to understand him? That’s not really fair. We cannot please him in that sense. We still do not understand him, and by that he is always punishing us in everything we do? Damn.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s pretty melodramatic. I’m not entirely sure what the Church teaches about Adam and Eve. Some might say it’s real and others that it’s a metaphor. I like the latter myself, simply because the Bible is full of metaphors and you come to a lot of nonsensical conclusions if you take things literally. Basically we’re imperfect beings - we sin, whether we know it or call it sin or not. The point isn’t that God deceived us into being sinful (deceived is a pretty strong word, since all he could be accused of would be not telling the whole truth), but that we were sinful to begin with. I agree, it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense when you take it literally, but I don’t see how God is punishing us now. How?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t want you to go twisting my words or jumping to conclusions. I never said that anyone who doesn’t follow religion is immoral or that only religion can bring happiness or that I can’t be happy without religion. I don’t know you, I can’t call you immoral. And I doubt you are immoral. An immoral act is easy to do, but to be immoral is something else.</p>

<p>I’m not asking for proof. There isn’t proof for a lot of things in science. But there is evidence.</p>

</aside>
<p>Sorry, getting the definitions of proof and evidence mixed. I’m not sure I’m the one to answer this question though, as I said that people’s reasons for believing are different. If you look at every reason that people give and just explain it logically then I very much doubt you’re looking for religion. Perhaps all this is pointless, since I think that someone will find religion only if they look for it. If they can’t believe in God, fine, neither do I if I really think hard about it, but you can believe in the teachings. If you’re looking only for a scientific explanation then I doubt that anything said here will satisfy you. You’ll only come away disappointed. You can’t expect a belief or faith to fall ready-made into your lap.</p>

<p>It’s secure and logical, yes, but that doesn’t make it right. Needless to say you’re not looking for religion but you want answers about why people believe in it when there’s no evidence. I’ve done my best to explain what religion is to me and really I can offer nothing more than that. I’m not believing in something that I can’t see or understand - I believe in the moral teachings with which I agree entirely and I can understand.

I base my beliefs in the teachings rather than on God alone, who is but an idea. I don’t think that’s ill-advised. The concept of God can come later if I can make that leap.</p>
<p>I think we’re going around in circles. I’ve done my best to present my argument but I think if you’re not looking for religion then my answers won’t satisfy your questions. I’m not sure you’re ever going to find the answer to the question of evidence.</p>

<p>The point I was not really explaining well was that human emotions are very sensitive to our current state. Because you feel something now, doesn’t mean it can’t be changed by something physical. Everything else about you can remain the same, but your beliefs can change by even the smallest physical change. Though I do agree life ( supposedly gods first gift to man ) can be taken away rather easily, it cannot be changed. Through physical change man cannot become demon. Can he?</p>

<p>a human without literature or external influence would define his world through stimulus. The stimulus that humans are able to perceive include: smell, taste, touch, see and hear. Since god is not directly perceptible as a being/entity using these stimuli, to the uninfluenced and untainted human ‘god’ wouldn’t exist in the universe as he perceives it.

I imagine there would be a great feeling of hope for me and humanity if such a thing could be done. But it doesn’t seem likely at this point.</p>
<p>The more I read here, it seems your not religious at all though. It seems your not even overly spiritual. It seems like you are some kind of…moralist. Questioning the morals of our species, and the guidelines we use to conduct ourselves. Since you’ve looked so much into the moral teachings of gods teachings, have you also looked into the moral theology of the great human thinkers? I think you might find that some of gods teachings can also be found in human theology born from creatures capable of love and compassion.</p>
<p>If this were true, what of god, religion, and spiritualism would remain? What use for it would you have?</p>

          <p>You know what I hate about debating religion?</p>
<p>It’s so gosh-darn convenient for people: you can excuse murder, rape, anything with it, you can’t prove it at all because that’s “how god works”, any illogical fallacies that are pointed out can all be excused with some convenient thing from the bible.</p>
