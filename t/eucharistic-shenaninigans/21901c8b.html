<p>All of your retorts to my point were either non-committal vagueness or about your stupid watchmaker argument.</p>
<p>Like danielsangeo has said, it’s so, so easy to create “information” using chance. Like I said, it’s the nature of chance to produce something we can interpret as information.</p>
<p>By the way, what is it you mean by “information”? Are you talking about DNA, or what?</p>
<p>Also, there is plenty of evidence for evolution. Not logic, not reasons, but proof. Viruses and bacteria evolve all the time. We’ve also witnessed the evolution of all kinds of animals: insects, birds etc. There is <span class="bbcode-i">evidence</span> for it happening.</p>
<p>It’s pure, beautiful logic.</p>
<p>If a creature has offspring that are slightly different, and it has offspring itself that are also slightly different, it’s not hard to believe that after a significant number of offspring down the line the end result could easily be wildly different. If there are certain changes in conditions (say temperature, surroundings, other wildlife) then certain changes will mean that some types of this creature will die off quicker than others. These other ones will thrive more, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>It’s just logic. I don’t see why you’d even contradict it, plenty of Popes have supported evolution for god’s sake. It doesn’t go against the bible, it makes sense and it happens all the time.</p>
<p>There’s absolutely no reason to deny it.</p>

<p>Then you’ve got your talking donkeys in Numbers, Jesus shouting at a fig tree in Matthew and Mark (you’d think if it was something worth mentioning for both of them it might be a little more important/make a little more sense.)<br>
I’m sorry but the Bible has some of the most fucking mental stories ever written in it. Jesus gets pissed off with a tree because figs aren’t in season and CURSES IT.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is a “moral of the story” type thing.  The fig tree was given life and a direction.  It was supposed to continue on the path and to grow as it was meant to.  It refused so it was cursed/cut down/killed.  In short, it is a warning to Christians that each of us has a purpose in life.  A God given purpose. If we refuse it, then we could be doomed to die.</p>
<p>And if you think that part about the children being killed by bears is bad, there are a ton more messed up stuff in the old testament that are much worse.</p>
<p>I dont take it as God being a sadistic Em Effer, I take it to mean he is not one to be messed with and he gets tired of his children’s behavior.  Jesus is simply the buffer that the human race needs in order to pass the pearly gates. :chuckle:</p>

          <p>This isn’t really going anywhere. It’s possible to create arguments against the fundamentals of religious texts, but when you put them in a metaphorical sense, debate comes down to interpretation and personal ideals.</p>
<p>I should point out that random chance is a far more powerful force than Mr. Assassin is giving it credit for. The way he is doing this is by ignoring a common human flaw. SCALE. The complexity of systems we exist in may seem simple and odds of randomly occurring events simply causing creation may seem slim, or even impossible. However, when you put it in the context of the size of the system involved, it becomes possible and even likely that random events will cause creation. I will acknowledge that there is limitations where this sort of thing can be analyzed, but when you picture every single particle in existence influencing everything else in existence, even in the smallest way, chance based on actions that greatly change the system we live in.</p>
<p>Physicists like to imagine they work in a frictionless vacuum for even small scale tests because even at the most base of existence systems are so complex, predicting the behavior of anything quickly spirals out of control.</p>
<p>Proponents of the scientifically acceptable god beyond our perception like to point this out as possibly suggesting that it implies a creator beyond the limits of our acceptance of being.</p>
<p>However, given evidence we have this seems unlikely. It seems there is no control of any portion of even the most base building blocks of our universe. There is information that indicates that the activities of matter that doesn’t even exist as we perceive it, behaves in any predictable fashion.</p>
<p>While you COULD interprit this as a limit of humanity, and human understanding when compared to god, I see no evidence pointing to any sort of god. I simply see this as a limitation of our perception in general. To us a 5th dimensional being would seem to be a god. A being able to control both time and all possible outcomes of our universe. But that doesn’t mean that such a being WOULD be a god, because it is possible that there is dimensions where the fundamental rules of existence would be different and such a creature wouldn’t be able to control the rules of existence beyond it’s perceived existence.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to get to here, is that even if there is a ‘god’. Some being of supreme creation of all existence, it seems rather self aggrandizing that such a creature would be OUR god, or would have any concept of our existence because as creatures we are not even visible on the scale of creation. It makes no sense. But it can’t be proven, especially not by us. We are too small, and know too little of the universe to come to any real conclusion about this. You can’t expect protons, electrons, or neutrons to conceive of complex systems. To them we may appear to be gods, because we can combine and separate them at will. But we aren’t. We are just beings beyond the system they exist in, while somehow being tied to their limitations as well. A god being to us may still be limited to different existential limitations. Anything beyond that seems as though the separation in scale is too great to make any real sense.</p>

<p>Then you’ve got your talking donkeys in Numbers, Jesus shouting at a fig tree in Matthew and Mark (you’d think if it was something worth mentioning for both of them it might be a little more important/make a little more sense.)<br>
I’m sorry but the Bible has some of the most fucking mental stories ever written in it. Jesus gets pissed off with a tree because figs aren’t in season and CURSES IT.</p>

<p>TALKING DONKEYS: This is a funny story! Here’s the account in the Bible. Numbers 22:21-34</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">22But God’s anger was kindled because he went,(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2022:21-34&amp;version=ESV#cen-ESV-4398A" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">A</a>) and the angel of the LORD took his stand in the way(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2022:21-34&amp;version=ESV#cen-ESV-4398B" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">B</a>) as his adversary. Now he was riding on the donkey, and his two servants were with him. 23And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand. And the donkey turned aside out of the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the road. 24Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side. 25And when the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pushed against the wall and pressed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So he struck her again. 26Then the angel of the LORD went ahead and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left. 27When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam. And Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff. 28Then the LORD(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2022:21-34&amp;version=ESV#cen-ESV-4404C" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">C</a>) opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?” 29And Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you.” 30And the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Is it my habit to treat you this way?” And he said, “No.” </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i"> 31Then the LORD(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2022:21-34&amp;version=ESV#cen-ESV-4407D" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">D</a>) opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face. 32And the angel of the LORD said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2022:21-34&amp;version=ESV#cen-ESV-4408E" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">E</a>) to oppose you because your way is perverse[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2022:21-34&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-4408a" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">a</a>] before me. 33The donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let her live.” 34Then Balaam said to the angel of the LORD,(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2022:21-34&amp;version=ESV#cen-ESV-4410F" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">F</a>) “I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back.”</span></p>
<p>So what we have here is Balaam, disobeying God, so an Angel is sent to stop him. Balaam is internationally known for being a ‘seer’, but he is still unable to see an Angel of the Lord, but his donkey, a symbol of stupidity, can. When Balaam will not see the angel, the Lord uses the donkey instead. The speaking of the donkey isn’t the point of the story, its just an amazingly humorous way of humiliating Balaam, and getting his attention in such a dramatic fashion. Balaam had to learn from a donkey before he could learn from God.</p>
<p>2 Peter comments on the foolishness of Balaam.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">They have followed(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter+2&amp;version=ESV#cen-ESV-30499AF" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">AF</a>) the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter+2&amp;version=ESV#cen-ESV-30499AG" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">AG</a>) gain from wrongdoing, 16[/SIZE]but was rebuked for his own transgression;(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter+2&amp;version=ESV#cen-ESV-30500AH" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">AH</a>) a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.</span></p>

<p>So you do excuse the brutal killing of children. Nice. I thought your God was meant to be merciful.<br>
I know the context and the story, you patronising moron. I didn’t ask for you to explain it, did I? What I’m saying (which you managed to completely ignore) is that if Jesus is decent enough not to blame the people who killed him, how could God be enough of a cunt to kill children for being rude to someone?</p>

If you read a book or a testament there is a meaning behind it. If you read the whole thing, by golly there is a meaning behind it all as well.</p>

<p>Much like a parent gets sick and tired of her child misbehaving and ultimately kicks him out on the street.  (which I have done)  It is very painful to do, but if begging pleading nudging grounding taking away and all other means of discipline do not work, what else do you have but to tell the child they no longer have access to your grace.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not going to read through all these but I will reply to this.</p>
<p>If you truly belief in science then you cannot belief in the supernatural. Scientific laws CANNOT BE BROKEN no matter what the circumstance.  Breaking them is like saying 2+2=5. There is no room for the “supernatural” in science. If your idea of a god truly exists then we will have to rethink science.</p>
<p>Just think of it, we have a set of scientific laws that EVERYTHING follows, and there are an infinite situations and an infinite occurrences when those laws were supported. So if SOMETHING, no matter how “supernatural” breaks those laws, then we must find a very very good in-depth scientific explanation for why that thing broke those laws, make a completely new set of laws, or, realize that whatever was breaking those laws doesn’t actually exist.</p>
<p>There is nothing outside of science, everything can be explained by science.</p>

</aside>
<p>Let me give some reasons for the interpretation.<br>
Fig Trees are symbols of Isreal.<br>
Hosea 9:10<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">      I found Israel<br>
Like grapes in the wilderness;<br>
I saw your fathers<br>
As the firstfruits on the fig tree in its first season. </span><br>
Nahum 3:12<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">      All your strongholds are fig trees with ripened figs</span></p>
<p>In this passage, Jesus just finished talking about the hypocrisy of Israel. The fig tree is fully leafed out, and in such a state one would normally expect to find fruit. I mean if you say any fruit tree, looks healthy and everything with big leaves, you’d be surprised to find no fruit. The fig tree is peculiar in this way, it gets leaves long before there is any fruit. This is like the hypocrisy of Israel. A people who said they honored God, but in their hearts were far from Him is like a tree with an abundance of leaves but no fruit.<br>
You’re right its not the trees fault, he’s using it as a symbol for Israel. We know this is how we are to take the interpretation because we are told that fig trees are symbols for Israel, and it makes sense after a lecture of Israel’s hypocrisy.</p>

<p>I should point out that random chance is a far more powerful force than Mr. Assassin is giving it credit for. The way he is doing this is by ignoring a common human flaw. SCALE. The complexity of systems we exist in may seem simple and odds of randomly occurring events simply causing creation may seem slim, or even impossible. However, when you put it in the context of the size of the system involved, it becomes possible and even likely that random events will cause creation. I will acknowledge that there is limitations where this sort of thing can be analyzed, but when you picture every single particle in existence influencing everything else in existence, even in the smallest way, chance based on actions that greatly change the system we live in.</p>
<p>Physicists like to imagine they work in a frictionless vacuum for even small scale tests because even at the most base of existence systems are so complex, predicting the behavior of anything quickly spirals out of control.</p>
<p>Proponents of the scientifically acceptable god beyond our perception like to point this out as possibly suggesting that it implies a creator beyond the limits of our acceptance of being.</p>
<p>However, given evidence we have this seems unlikely. It seems there is no control of any portion of even the most base building blocks of our universe. There is information that indicates that the activities of matter that doesn’t even exist as we perceive it, behaves in any predictable fashion.</p>
<p>While you COULD interprit this as a limit of humanity, and human understanding when compared to god, I see no evidence pointing to any sort of god. I simply see this as a limitation of our perception in general. To us a 5th dimensional being would seem to be a god. A being able to control both time and all possible outcomes of our universe. But that doesn’t mean that such a being WOULD be a god, because it is possible that there is dimensions where the fundamental rules of existence would be different and such a creature wouldn’t be able to control the rules of existence beyond it’s perceived existence.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to get to here, is that even if there is a ‘god’. Some being of supreme creation of all existence, it seems rather self aggrandizing that such a creature would be OUR god, or would have any concept of our existence because as creatures we are not even visible on the scale of creation. It makes no sense. But it can’t be proven, especially not by us. We are too small, and know too little of the universe to come to any real conclusion about this. You can’t expect protons, electrons, or neutrons to conceive of complex systems. To them we may appear to be gods, because we can combine and separate them at will. But we aren’t. We are just beings beyond the system they exist in, while somehow being tied to their limitations as well. A god being to us may still be limited to different existential limitations. Anything beyond that seems as though the separation in scale is too great to make any real sense.</p>

<p>Anyway, say there really is a god out there. Then WTF are his motives??? Why the fuck did he make everything? What’s it mean to him? What was his purpose in making people and the universe? And don’t give me some bullshit that his motives can not be understood. If he is supernatural and odes all this stuff he must be capable of thought, and if he is capable of thought, he then must require motives. And if he truly exists and is truly all-powerful then he should have a motive for creating people. So what was that motive? Was he trying to pick up chicks at a bar by showing them this cool planet he made? Was he bored and decided to make himself an ant farm? Is he trying to learn  something by making a massive cage full of guinea pigs?</p>

You may say unlikely, and surprising. I say surpassing the point of ludicrous. I admit, my mind can’t conceive of the infinite, but we are talking about infinite, piled on top of infinite, on top of infinite…and so on. Even when thinking of a universe of infinite size, and then thinking up an infinite number of alternate universes, with an infinitely different set of outcomes and rules simply leave humanity as too insignificant. If we are so damned important, why were we made to be so insignificant in relation to our own existence, let alone the possibilities that exist beyond it?</span></span>

<p>First answer me this Garth dear.  Knowing how crappy the world is, why on earth would you pro-create?  Children cause you heartache and pain. They turn against you and dont listen to you.  They grow up and who knows if they will turn into murdering monsters. Why bother?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I probably won’t have kid. Mainly because I have a personal aversion to them, I don’t believe it is bad to simply have children, I feel it is bad to have too many children. If everyone had a certain number of children, we could maintain our population or even slowly lower it. Also, most children do the above actions because they have shitty parents. And then they themselves grow up to be shitty parents and the cycle continues endlessly. But I really don’t see what this has to do with this topic.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m sorry catz, it appear I didn’t quite catch what you were getting at. God is all-powerful, so then he could so easily create perfect children that didn’t cause heart ache.</p>

          <p>That’s not really a comparison that is fair catz. Children relate to their creator in a real sense. There is a basis of similarity. A more accurate thing to say is Why do you create proteins in you body knowing they will be burned away in a very short time.<br>
This lack of relation is more accurate to the relationship of a god figure to us. Weather or not ‘god’ creates us out of will, or simply as function is an interesting thought though.</p>
