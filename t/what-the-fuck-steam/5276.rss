    <title>What the fuck, Steam?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-the-fuck-steam/5276</link>
    <description>So I tried to start up Steam just now, it gave me the update bar, then all of a sudden it goes away and says it deleted the .exe but the &quot;files are still there&quot;.

Huh?

Why the fuck did it do that?</description>

            <p>Meh, Sometimes I wish I didn’t have steam. While it is a good way to organize my games some times it’s just a hassle to use. I do miss the original screen of Half Life, well used to. I found old WON versions and installed those, but still. People who can’t be connected to the internet 24/7 like alot of us are at a disadvantage when it comes to steam. It means they can’t play their single player games 24/7 with out being online and they have to go find something else.</p>

            <p>But if I deactivate the updates, I would be missing the entire point of Steam! I mean I think Steam is good, and it’s better than standalone games in many ways. Overall, I like Steam a lot, however, there are some small things that sometimes bother me that didn’t happen before Steam. But this is just evolution, you have to lose some things to gain other things!</p>

            <p>Steam does fuck around sometimes. After an update it stopped working for me and I couldn’t be bothered to mess with it so I just played my non-stem games. Then a couple of days later another update and voila, it’s working again. Go figure.<br>
I do think you might have to reinstall it though…</p>

            <p>So I tried to start up Steam just now, it gave me the update bar, then all of a sudden it goes away and says it deleted the .exe but the “files are still there”.</p>
