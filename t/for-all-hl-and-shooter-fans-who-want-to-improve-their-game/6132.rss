    <description>i&#39;ve found this forum just surfing around and looking for a doom 3 gfx-mod. there you find a link collection to mod the gfx of all the great shooters and i think it&#39;s the best and most complete link selection with the best gfx-mods. they also have a lot of gfx-mods for all half-life games there.

here we go:

</aside>
<p>protip: maybe, but if you are on the forum i’ve posted i thought it would be no prob to scroll to the game you want to mod, because in germany the games have most likely the same name and if you’ve polished your glasses you will see that game titles are big and fat written there  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  if you’re glasses are ok then and you’ve finally found the game of your choice and if you click a mod link there they mostly lead to english sites :3</p>
<p>it’s worth to look there often because it seems they keep the mods with link updates up to date.</p>
