    <description>Hello All, 

No modern games really impress me these days, they all seem the  same and are more like a Hollywood film and don&#39;t give you complete control, so far no game since &#39;Oblivion&#39; has impressed me with its gameplay, although I still keep up with reviews modern games are all looks and little substance in my opinion  :frowning:  I was about to re-play all the Splinter cell games again when I found info about &#39;Black Mesa&#39; and it bought back fond memories of &#39;Half Life&#39; and what a great game it was in changing gaming history, that opening scene &#39;wow factor&#39; !!  I am so glad you guys are still keeping this classic alive  :slight_smile: 

So are there any fans of the original &#39;Splinter Cell&#39; games here  :slight_smile:  ?</description>

            <p>Blacklist and Chaos Theory are tied for my favorites. If you haven’t tried Blacklist, I strongly urge you to. Much, MUCH better than Double Agent and Conviction.</p>

            <p>Conviction and Blacklist in particular are a lot more linear than previous entries. I mean, the very earliest Splinter Cell and Pandora Tomorrow were pretty linear too, but Chaos Theory had some pretty open layouts with a few paths open to the player in some missions. The Panama Bank map is probably my favorite map in the whole series from the sheer amount of ways you can play it- there’s three ways into the building and the vault access panels can be used in any order.</p>

<p>I’d disagree on the more recent ones. I haven’t played the newest one, but I played the hell out of Conviction (and watched a bit of the newest), and while it’s not much like the previous games, I don’t find it in any way like Call of Duty, nor a bad game in general. It’s much simpler than its predecessors in terms of completing objectives and game mechanics, yeah, but I feel it’s still a great game that can stand on its own.</p>

</aside>
<p>What put me off everything post DA was how the game tells you what to do by projecting instructions  on buildings and what button’s to press etc, it took the ‘intelligence’ out of the game and dumbed it down IMO, perhaps I will give the newer ones another go now sometime has passed  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I agree about Double Agent I have not even finished both versions, I think I got board on the cruise ship level  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  But I attend to finish them when I have done Black Mesa now  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  As for the most recent ‘so called next generation’ ones it just don’t fell like Splinter Cell but more like ‘Call Of Duty’ in my opinion  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Massive Splinter Cell nerd right here.</p>
<p>Own just about all of them, often for multiple platforms. First game on PC,PS2, Xbox, and GameCube alone.<br>
Chaos Theory was my favorite. When they hit Double Agent, things started to go downhill  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>I felt it worked really well. You at least got more control over your speed than a simple toggle, which was kind of necessary since I think the early SC games had fully analog movement speed. Not too common anymore. Anyway I almost never used anything besides slowest, fastest, and maybe one of the in between ones out of maybe 5 or 6 speeds. It’s as good as any solution to a kb not having any way to emulate analog movement speed like that, though like I said, it’s not that common that games (third person at least) do that anymore.</p>
<p>It’s in 1 and CT, and I assume 2 as well. I think they removed it in Double Agent and if not that then Conviction.</p>

            <p>I remember 1 had this walk speed control, where instead of a simple walk button, you used the scroll wheel to tweak the speed, like a makeshift joystick tilt. It was interesting, and kind of awkward to use at first.</p>

            <p>The PC versions of 1 and 3 (3 is Chaos Theory) are fine. It’s the second one that’s screwed up. And no, the PS2 was much weaker than the Xbox, so the graphics are worse. I’m not sure if there’s any differences between the PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube versions besides graphics though. But again, 1 and 3 play fine on PC.</p>

            <p>I’ve only played 1 and 3 but they were pretty cool. Honestly I like the Thief games better, 1 and 2, and stealth games.</p>
<p>Apparently the second Splinter Cell game has lots of problems on PC, which is a shame.</p>
