    <title>Intel Core i7 2600 Stock Cooler</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/intel-core-i7-2600-stock-cooler/8849</link>
    <description>Can someone give me an idea of how well the stock/default heat sink for the Intel Core i7 2600 performs?  I&#39;m about to put together a PC and it was suggested on another thread that I ditch the default cooler and go for the Cooler Master Hyper 212 plus/evo.  Can someone tell me which one is better?  I don&#39;t plan on overclocking at this point and time but I just need to know if it&#39;s worth the extra 30 dollars if I don&#39;t plan on doing anything special with my CPU.

Here&#39;s the default cooler:

            <p>for non overclocking purposes its good, mine ran at a stable 30-40 degrees celsius durring gaming (it is now overclocked to 3.8 ghz) and is 10 degrees higher temps.</p>
<p>EDIT: noticed you got the 2600 while i have the 2600k but its the same cooler.</p>

            <p>It’s not like the cooler is horrible, but it’s not very good if you want to do anything with the CPU in the future.</p>
<p>It’s better to get a good cooler to future-proof it in case you ever do want to do anything. You know, to just get it out of the way.</p>
