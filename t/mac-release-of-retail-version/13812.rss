            <p>I’d assume its like it said on the forums for the (now) legacy version: they have no plans to do it because it is difficult, but if you can do it then by all means, go for it.</p>
<p>But don’t take my word for it. I use both Mac and PC so having both versions would be great, but I can settle for the better PC version. In any way, if you’re a Mac only user, I feel you. I hated not having a PC to play awesome games on.</p>
<p>…but it would be really cool for a Mac version   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">   . Just don’t get your hopes up.</p>
