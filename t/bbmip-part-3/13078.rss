    <title>BBMIP:Part 3</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bbmip-part-3/13078</link>
    <description>This update is a little early this week because I am on vacation and don&#39;t want to do it over the weekend. This will be a smaller update than the last 2 and will show some of the details from the first thread. As a reminder please remember to keep it on topic. Questions about ANYTHING other than what I am posting is going to be considered off topic. Start your own thread.  :smiley: 

Ok the first picture is a new version of what we were doing with models and brush work before. In different areas of AM/UC there were CRT monitors kind of embedded in the counter tops. I went ahead and made these to replace them. The screens are all linked to the generic office screens. In case you are having a hard time figuring out this model it is covered by glass so its flush with the counter and in the render back face culling is on. The next 2 are of the new hood in the 2nd lab in AM. Like everything else this replaces brush work. Note that the stainless steel texture pictured in this one is WIP and was changed since that picture. I made the fire extinguishing nozzles to go in the inside. I pictured Halon gas or something like that coming out of those if there was a fire. The 4th picture is of all the new cabinets in lab 2. These pictured are early WIP and are a bit different in the final version. The final picture is of a TEM microscope we have had for 8 years or more. The old model was dusted off and remade. The only thing that is original is the cabinet everything else is mine. There are several skins for this. This model hasn&#39;t been compiled so its not currently in any level, but I think it will show up somewhere.......

            <p>I like to think my math would add up… if you guys were developing full-time. But you’re not. Everyone is doing this in their free-time. So of course it would take much much longer than what I guessed.</p>
<p>Kinda slipped my mind.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I work full time plus so your math won’t add up. I’m lucky most weeks to get one done. There usually aren’t more than 4 modelers working on something at one. time</p>

<p>How long would you say it takes from making the first polygon to having a finished mesh (I think that’s the term)? I know it probably depends on the complexity of the model so could we use, say, the vent grill as an example, and that microscope as another example?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well it literally depends on the model. There were not many changes to a simple grill model pictured with the TC anteroom vent (anteroom vent took 8 hrs). I basically converted and UV mapped it ( it is the untextured model to the left of the TC grill). For like the powersource model maybe 20 hours +. There are 5 UVs and multiple revisions, rebakes of the AO and texture changes. Or like the cabinet models… once I got the basic shapes and proportions set, the first might take 5 hours and the rest 30 min. For the microscope I need to determine the detail level I want on the cylinders, 6, 8 ,10 ,12+ sides and how much other detail I will want in the model. Most models in our original mod were very low poly. Over the last 11 years  the requirements have changed and so will the poly counts. I can’t tell you the exact poly count of the microscope but its probably around 7k. Any model with cylinders over 6 sides will really shoot the poly count up.</p>

<p>By the way, the screen looks cool. Great work. Just another question. The glassware on the countertop. How is it modeled? That material could be slightly more glassy/transparent</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s just a polygon plane with transparency. The way alpha channels work in source is all or nothing. You can have a plane with holes via alpha chanel like a chain link fence or grating you walk on. The other option is to have it transparent where you can see through it and that’s either on or off and you can’t adjust the opacity. Other game engines can this can’t.<br>
Edit: I was reminded on Facebook that the microscope is a TEM not SEM they are different and I get them confused because I have never used one.</p>

            <p>The keyboard looks like a Model M keyboard. Certainly a relic, but an amazing gaming Keyboard. A smaller keyboard would make sense in a modern lab, taking less space of the desk. But for me, the real weird part is the absence of mouse.</p>

            <p>Agreed, it would be better if there was a keyboard in the table with it. Maybe even a panel that flips so you have desktop on one side, then flip over the panel and there’s the keyboard.</p>

<p>Not worth it size wise. The rivets are small and if I made them any bigger it looks out of scale. Plus the thing is 15 feet up and you don’t get close. Odds are no one would have noticed it (the hood) if I hadn’t mentioned it.</p>

<p>Thanks. Just to show the difference in WIP textures and final, this is 2 shots I just took in HLMV. It really sucks compared to toolbag… The reason it looks a lot different is once I got the base texture close to what I wanted I tweaked things after seeing it in game. There was also a bit of feedback from the other team members that I used to get to the final state. Mostly it was making it look like it had pieces that were riveted/screwed together. Also is you not the first hood picture didn’t have a collar at the ceiling. After getting it in game it just didn’t look quite right and needed to be blended in better.<br>

            <p>Um no lol. If you ever seen Halon gas used to extinguish fires it sprays out of relatively small nozzles. It isn’t used in game as an effect this is just a little detail touch. It could also be a sprinkler. Here is a non game related video that shows the gas going off. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI_jWN2fWIY" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI_jWN2fWIY</a> And to answer the next question before its answered…the effect isn’t in game because the the gas tanks that housed them are empty by the time the player wakes up.</p>

            <p>This update is a little early this week because I am on vacation and don’t want to do it over the weekend. This will be a smaller update than the last 2 and will show some of the details from the first thread. As a reminder please remember to keep it on topic. Questions about ANYTHING other than what I am posting is going to be considered off topic. Start your own thread.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Ok the first picture is a new version of what we were doing with models and brush work before. In different areas of AM/UC there were CRT monitors kind of embedded in the counter tops. I went ahead and made these to replace them. The screens are all linked to the generic office screens. In case you are having a hard time figuring out this model it is covered by glass so its flush with the counter and in the render back face culling is on. The next 2 are of the new hood in the 2nd lab in AM. Like everything else this replaces brush work. Note that the stainless steel texture pictured in this one is WIP and was changed since that picture. I made the fire extinguishing nozzles to go in the inside. I pictured Halon gas or something like that coming out of those if there was a fire. The 4th picture is of all the new cabinets in lab 2. These pictured are early WIP and are a bit different in the final version. The final picture is of a TEM microscope we have had for 8 years or more. The old model was dusted off and remade. The only thing that is original is the cabinet everything else is mine. There are several skins for this. This model hasn’t been compiled so its not currently in any level, but I think it will show up somewhere…<br>
