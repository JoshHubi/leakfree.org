    <title>Animation Revamp Crashes and Uncut Maps</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/animation-revamp-crashes-and-uncut-maps/12509</link>
    <description>I am posting my mini-dump files from using the animation revamp Particle pack and the uncut maps...

I would like to know how the engine is being affected by using the enhancements in conjunction with unofficial maps... So this is not so much a bug report of vanilla black mesa so treat it as such only for seeing how things are going wrong when using the heavier animations and performance straining maps combined.

It&#39;s perhaps the best stress test we could give the Black Mesa Game... Under this source engine build...And it failed on my PC and others too.... So I have posted it in hope that the port to SDK 2013 better resources can perhaps be routed to different tasks but I honestly know not how this works... So please do not consider it that I am asking anything from this only that it may show you where something is going wrong that should not with engine resources.
