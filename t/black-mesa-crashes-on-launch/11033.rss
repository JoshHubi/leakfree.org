    <title>Black Mesa Crashes on Launch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-crashes-on-launch/11033</link>
    <description>Hello. I have looked everywhere, and not quite seen anyone else with this specific problem to this degree.

Basically, I have spent now two days reinstalling BM over six times now, and everytime I install, it goes in my steam, but every time I try to launch it, it shows the blurred screen with the &quot;Loading...&quot; in the corner, then that screen goes to black, and I always have to use Task Manager to shut it down. Now it WILL launch in windowed mode, but even then, attempting to start a new game crashes the mod.

I have...downloaded the mod from many different places (all files, MD5, Installer and the main one, called a zip and archive). I put the files in the same folder (outside the entire steam folder), run the installer in the same folder as the MD5 and the zip. It installs, and tells me at the end when the installation is finished (it asks you to run black mesa when finished, its the popup with the zombie on it). So...I do all this, and have done it many times and I end up with the same problem. Tried downloading a torrent (which has all three files in a single folder for you). Nope. Tried changing the dx setting, nope. When it runs in windowed mode, I tried to change the resolution from there (just makes the mod crash), manually used both the fullscreen option in the windowed mode (crash) and used the launch properties command -fullscreen, nope.

I simply cannot figure out why this mod will not work. I do make sure it installs to the sourcemods folder (it becomes the BMS folder). I have no possible idea of what else I can even try.

And my system specs are...
