    <title>We&#39;ve Got Hostiles: Pre-Disaster</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weve-got-hostiles-pre-disaster/14553</link>
    <description>Well, it&#39;s now officially 2016- and what better way to kick off the new year than by announcing a new project?

After my previous project fell through, I found myself out of work. This was somewhat problematic for me, since it meant I didn&#39;t have anything to map for- and let&#39;s face it, mapping doesn&#39;t quite feel the same if it&#39;s done just for the heck of it. Now, while I was still working on the project, I did do a bit of work for BMPD- it mostly involved making tram stops for when the tram lines are useable. So, having been a part-time contributor, I figured I could step it up a notch and become a full-time contributor- after all, how hard could it be?

So, after a bit of deliberation, I eventually decided to have a go at We&#39;ve Got Hostiles. Now, this chapter is [i]barely[/i] affected by the Resonance Cascade- the worst that appears to have happened is a few of the lights have gone out. However, I still think you could do a fair amount with a pre-disaster version of this chapter. But, because of the minimal changes throughout most of the map, most of the screenshots in this thread will be new areas (unless there have been [i]significant [/i]changes to existing areas).

I&#39;ve also decided to announce that you might also see [b]entirely new maps[/b] in this chapter&#39;s pre-disaster campaign. This is mostly because the WGH maps are already pretty full (at least in terms of entdata), and a lot of my ideas for new areas would take up a fairly large amount of space. Now, I can&#39;t guarantee that these new maps will come out, as I might be pretty sick of warehouses by the time I&#39;m done with the existing maps. And, as I somewhat inplied in the last sentence, the new maps will come [i]only[/i] once the existing maps are completed. But, if all goes well, you&#39;ll get 3 new maps to explore- won&#39;t that be fun?

[u][b][i]Progress so far[/size][/i][/b][/u]
At this point, the pre-disaster campaign of WGH is still in it&#39;s infancy. I&#39;ve only completed a few areas of the A map, and most of them are still a work-in-progress. I can&#39;t really say when you&#39;ll get it (I&#39;m not very good with release dates), but if I&#39;m getting close to a release I&#39;ll let you know. I&#39;ll make sure to keep you all up-to-date on progress in the coming months. Until then, though, why not take a look at some of what you can expect in Pre-Disaster We&#39;ve Got Hostiles?

The cafeteria looks pretty good fully lit. It would probably be even better if there were people using it, but I&#39;ll get to that later (oh, and it looks like I forgot to turn on one of the lights over the menu, too. Just ignore it for now)

[img]https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/364029569305470240/5FBBA9381DF5C232B2C3CE529577BEF2F5FD37D0/[/img]
I can&#39;t take full credit for this area- it was copied over from an old PD WGH map Sakai was working on. At this point, it still needs a bit of work (note to self: look in to aligning the stripe textures. Oh, and give those trucks a bit more space- if this were real, it would be a real pain to back in without damaging something), but I&#39;d say it&#39;s mostly finished. Also, I cannot explain the red glow in the upper left-hand corner (however, it wasn&#39;t there before I built cubemaps, so I suspect it&#39;s related to reflections somehow).

[img]https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/361777350814344216/EB83D8CF2C2E4B0CCE8238970DBF1346E71E8E5A/[/img]

The room shown here was originally going to be a storage area, but I thought the available space wasn&#39;t wide enough to fit a warehouse. So I decided to build this forklift repair area instead. This area changed a fair amount from it&#39;s original design. I created the more contrasting room on the top, which was later modified by Sakai to fit in with the WGH aesthetic better (the current product is at the bottom). Also, ignore the black room at the end. That&#39;s there until I decide what I want to put there.

[img]https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/364029569305470070/292113122DB3E9ABC7ED317219067D59470160E1/[/img]
Here&#39;s the current version of the offices adjacent to the forklift repair area. There was an easter egg in one of them, but I hid it so I wouldn&#39;t give it away.


And that&#39;s about it for now. As always feedback, suggestions, and ideas are appreciated!</description>

            <p>Hello, I would  like to point out that every time I launch the map, the game closes by itself, and I can’t play with the map, I tried to check the local files but nothing works, here, if someone could help me, I’m a taker. Thank you</p>

            <p>Yeah that definitely sounds like I need to recompile in that case, however I’ll need to see if I have the old map source lying around- I was in the midst of moving a <em>lot</em> of stuff around before I kinda lost steam so I’ll need to see if I still have a version that compiles all right</p>

            <p>That’s definitely possible, I know updates can cause issues between versions. I’ll look into recompiling the map for the latest game version, should have some time over break but I have no idea if it’s gonna break anything lol</p>

            <p>Alright so I loaded in map 2 of Inbound, and then loaded in the map from the console and it still failed to load. I want to play this map but I have no idea what may be causing it, maybe an update to the game caused it?</p>

            <p>Have you made sure to load an official BM map? I’ve seen a few other threads on the issue and that tends to fix the issue. Dunno why it works, but give it a shot and lemme know if that solves it</p>

            <p>Idk if you’re still working on this, but I just wanted to let you know if you still check this, that your map crashes upon inputting it into the dev console. Just check the comments on the workshop and you’ll see i’m not the only one either. You should look into this if you ever have the time.</p>

<p>These doors are really weird. Why not just the regular WGH garage doors?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of real loading docks which use these kinds of doors. In most instances I’ve seen, these doors are used on the loading docks themselves (i.e. the spot where the truck backs into), whereas the more common “roll up” doors which are found throughout the facility are generally used between rooms within the facility itself (which is not to say that I have never seen them used for loading docks). However, I will note that doors like these don’t usually go straight up- so I’ll either replace them or make some adjustments to their tracks so they don’t look so odd.</p>

<p>maybe we should have two different types of wall texture to help break things up?</p>

</aside>
<p>I was actually thinking that we could get some custom restroom textures in here, but until we get a texture artist we’ll have to find another way to resolve this issue. I’m wondering <span class="bbcode-i">which</span> textures we should use though- I’m not entirely sure which textures would go well with the texture the restrooms currently use- or which ones to replace them with.</p>

            <p>Wow, this is actually <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> shaping up!</p>
<p>The new areas are looking really good. A while down the road, I may actually want to work with you on moving them <span class="bbcode-i">around </span>to make this level of the HSSF more of a cohesive section and less just a sprawl, but as it stands I quite like the design of each individual one. A few things worth noting:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280520202/FFCB779FABBB7CA051D4DF44CEB98E4B51439709/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280520202/FFCB779FABBB7CA051D4DF44CEB98E4B51439709/" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1920×1080</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div>Think you’re going a little overboard on the lights in here. Or, well, actually a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> overboard. Get rid of the side lights and just keep the roof one.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280530188/EF6B47466457F8B0D52D64A9798B46D4243A5412/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280530188/EF6B47466457F8B0D52D64A9798B46D4243A5412/" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1920×1080</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div>The offices are finally shaping up, which means I can finally put my finger on what exactly was bothering me about them. First of all, there’s the desks- WGH uses those green metal work tables in place of the white L-shaped desks, and the small steel desks use the ‘dirty’ skin. Additionally, the room as it is is very <span class="bbcode-i">cramped</span>- there’s a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> of decals on the walls, and more importantly every available bit of floor/wall space is taken up with desks. Black Mesa usually does not do things this ‘dense’ in the administrative areas; I’d say offices of this size should only have one or two desks. That, and the chairs are different colors.</p>

<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280567472/542B1741AADF2C39BF94259FE24D6B2DF516C717/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280567472/542B1741AADF2C39BF94259FE24D6B2DF516C717/" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1920×1080</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>I’m still triggered by the placement of this stairwell, and still looking for any other place it could possibly be put.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280572506/89E7BE01FCB1E7C8D4905AB8BFF31416DFFD1FC7/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280572506/89E7BE01FCB1E7C8D4905AB8BFF31416DFFD1FC7/" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1920×1080</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div>These doors are <span class="bbcode-i">really</span><span class="bbcode-i"> weird</span>. Why not just the regular WGH garage doors?</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280591352/E991FFF23F3567327E149F681B8884ACE05D4474/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/106229389280591352/E991FFF23F3567327E149F681B8884ACE05D4474/" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1920×1080</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div>Obviously the bathrooms are extremely new, but I’m already thinking of how to go about making them less fake-looking. For one thing they’re very boxy, but I’m not sure how to fix that… hmm, maybe we should have two different types of wall texture to help break things up? Also, while it might be expected in an actual building, Black Mesa is much more sparing in the overhead lights: I’d suggest removing at least half of the ones in here.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>While it certainly wasn’t as long as my previous period of silence, It’s definitely been a little while since I’ve checked in. I am pleased to report that after spending a few weeks wrangling various bugs (and dealing with the ultimate evil known as tjuncts), I have finally released version 0.2. While there’s definitely room for improvement, I’d say that the current product is of an acceptable level of quality. There were still a few things that I was unable to include in this update, but it’s far less than what I was unable to include in the previous release. Which brings me to my next announcement- I am pleased to announce that the A map is nearing completion. That’s right, after almost a year in development, it is almost done. Unfortunately, this isn’t necessarily a voluntary decision. The map is simply becoming too big for the compiler to handle. So chances are the next update will contain some refined areas, and maybe a few new ones- after that, most of the updates on the map will be bug and lighting fixes. On the bright side, this means I can finally move on to the long-awaited Map B. It’s likely the first release will just be the stock map without any disaster elements, but chances are most of you will be just fine with that. Anyways, enough announcements. I think it’s about time you got a look at what you can expect in this update.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108480551728071568/175D4E324CD54BA3313A3427894D4FAE81084246/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108480551728071568/175D4E324CD54BA3313A3427894D4FAE81084246/" alt="" width="690" height="323"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1280×600</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>Right here is one of the bathrooms next to the High Security Storage Facility Cafeteria. Not much to say about this one, since there really aren’t any points of interest here. The only thing of note that I can think of would be that I’d like to get a few custom props for this bathroom, but since I don’t have a modeler working with me, the custom props will have to wait.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108481189090794295/ECF7BF65BA10FF0313C9A32C25C675A82B3FE4CC/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108481189090794295/ECF7BF65BA10FF0313C9A32C25C675A82B3FE4CC/" alt="" width="690" height="323"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1280×600</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>As I stated in an earlier post, this room is the new location of the Hazardous Materials Storage Area (and it looks a heck of a lot better than the original). I was originally going to have the barrels stored in separate stalls, but a quick Google search showed that real Hazmat Storage Areas look very similar to the design seen here. It’s by no means perfect (the lighting around the blue barrels is pretty wonky in places, but overall I’m fairly happy with how it turned out. There’s also an elevator in the very back- it’s mostly just there because I needed something to fill the back wall, but I think it turned out to be a nice addition to the room.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108481189090794872/43EDC2CFC527FC25AA3A90FC7E8DF13C564EF8D2/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108481189090794872/43EDC2CFC527FC25AA3A90FC7E8DF13C564EF8D2/" alt="" width="690" height="323"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1280×600</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>This hallway is the new connection between Silo D Access Point 2 and the back end of Storage Area 3. The diagonal hallway does look a little bit odd, but I figured that if the Cafeteria could get away with it, I probably could too, to some degree. If you’re fine with it, I’ll keep it, but I’m thinking of changing it up eventually. As a side note, that weird-looking out-of-place steel beam on the floor is a workaround for an issue with textures not lining up. I think there’s one more spot in the level where this occurs, but it’s not too noticeable (I do, however, plan on fixing it soon).<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108481189090796030/EDAE5AFB0B9457EDCF0794658A157132584D3010/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108481189090796030/EDAE5AFB0B9457EDCF0794658A157132584D3010/" alt="" width="690" height="323"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1280×600</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>This area actually has a fairly interesting story behind it. Originally, it was intended to be a distribution hub where goods travelling on conveyors would be routed to different points of the facility. However, it soon became obvious that this would not work. Firstly, such a room would’ve taken a a lot of work if it was going to look good. Since I was already concerned with time constraints, I felt that something like that would have a major impact on my overall productivity. Second, it would probably be beyond my ability to get such a system working, and I didn’t want to take the easy way out and just make it not work. Third, the room really didn’t feel right- it just felt kind of odd. And, upon further examination, I found that the room clashed with part of Blast Pit. So I moved the room, ripped out all the conveyor stuff, and converted the room into a storage room (which I’ve dubbed Storage Area 4). I’m pretty happy with how it turned out, and I think it looks a lot better than the conveyor room did (not that I’ve completely dismissed the idea…).<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108481189090796439/C61E5651915F5E6FE2EE0B003676EAC4FA245D7C/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108481189090796439/C61E5651915F5E6FE2EE0B003676EAC4FA245D7C/" alt="" width="690" height="323"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1280×600</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>This odd looking area is a small set of offices located behind Maximum Security Storage Area 1, and is mainly tasked with keeping and processing freight records. I must say, I really wasn’t feeling it with this area. It’s probably one of the oddest looking areas that the facility has seen to date. But even though it seems odd for me to release a map with an area I wasn’t entirely sure about, there is reason behind my decision. I want to see what you think of it- so let me know what you think of it. If you like it, I’ll keep it. But if you don’t, I’ll go in and make some adjustments. I’ll probably keep the sliding doors though- even though there’s no other doors like them throughout the facility, they’re a lot easier for NPCs to move through.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108480551732056846/C8EDD7987E8CC6AC7B67D7E070107D3801DFA2D2/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/108480551732056846/C8EDD7987E8CC6AC7B67D7E070107D3801DFA2D2/" alt="" width="690" height="323"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1280×600</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
The last stop on our tour is Receiving Dock 1, which serves as this level’s main means of receiving cargo from other areas of the facility. While I’m mostly pleased with this area, the lighting seems to be a little it dim in places (Especially the upper corners). But, since I’m no lighting expert, I decided that it was good enough (not perfect, but at least you can see everything). I’m also thinking a few of the walls might be a bit bland, but then again I do seem to feel the urge to fill every surface to the brim with details, so I thought that it would probably be best if I took it easy and didn’t go overboard on detail (still not sure whether I should’ve added a few more things, though). I probably will come back here to make some adjustments, but I’m not sure what those adjustments are going to be yet.</p>
<p>That pretty much concludes this update. As I have mentioned before, feel free to give feedback, criticism (as long as I can actually get something useful from it), suggestions, or ideas. If you find any bugs, be sure to report them, and I’ll get them fixed as soon as possible. Next time, I should have some news regarding the B Map and what you can expect in it. But until then, you’ve got a nice nearly-completed map to tide you over. Thanks, and have fun!</p>

            <p>So, rather than coming here to post a new update (rest assured version 0.2 is being worked on), I’ve come to let you know that I’m looking for a texture artist. Nothing major, since I figure the most I’ll need are a few signs. However, the main reason I’m looking for someone with texture editing skill has to do with the security monitors seen throughout the level. There’s a pesky tripmine being displayed on the monitor scrrn for Storage Area 3- which makes little sense, seeing as the tripmine is not present in this iteration of said storage area. In conclusion, if you have the ability to create textures/model skins , just send me a PM. Anyhoo, that should be it for now, and an update showcasing my current works in progress should be up soon (or when I feel like it).</p>

            <p>Because I’m such a nice guy, I thought I’d give you a preview of a revamped version of one of the areas in the warehouse. Aside from fixing some lighting issues and comatose NPCs (along with a few other bugs), the next update will include a redesigned version of what was originally the Hazardous Materials Storage Area (which still exists, just in a different location).<br>

<p>Seen here is Maximum Security Storage Area 1 (which, If you ask me, looks a whole lot better than the original design). Since this area is a work in progress, feedback or suggestions are welcome. Anyways, that’s about it for this update, and you can expect Version 0.1.2 to be released sometime next week (if all goes according to plan, that is!).</p>

            <p>Due to a number of technical limitations something like that would be VERY difficult if not impossible to implement as part of the regular user interface. However, we do plan to have <span class="bbcode-i">some sort</span> of controllable tram system that will make it easier to move to different parts of the facility without spending hours walking from place to place. I don’t know <span class="bbcode-i">quite</span> what form the controls for the tram will take, but a map where you can select different areas of the facility <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> be doable with basically a lot of func_buttons.</p>

            <p>Hey guys, first of all: Kudos! This is a great project and i am definately looking forward to roam the facility like a boy on his first visit to Disney Land.</p>
<p>As I gather that several maps eventually will be able to be entered through more than one transition point and as Grey Heron already adressed the possible resulting loss of sense of direction, are you planning of implementing some kind of map system? I do know that most of the chapters are actually overlapping, but I am thinking of a mapsystem similar to somethink like <a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/z2g663smz5io6dqtqbhn.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Metroid Prime</a> or the recent <a href="https://cdn2.gamepur.com/images/feature/doom-2016-secret-level-argent-facility-1.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Doom</a> (see the links for reference). It might be a combination of a simplified, scaled-down map for local orientation and a general facility map that works more like a <a href="https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/metroid/images/d/d3/Zebes_Hexa_Map.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20081122115504" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">topogrammatical map</a> like the Metroid Series uses, too.</p>
<p>Anyways, awesome job so far!</p>

<p>That’s a pretty interesting expansion of the canonical map. However, you should go through at some point and make sure all the openable doors have a visible handle on both sides, or some other visible cue they’re openable. I also got lost quite easily, but I’m not sure if that’s bad layout or just me having a poor sense of direction.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Unfortunately, I kind of glossed over putting a distinction between which doors can be opened and which ones can’t. Although I could probably make the difference more recognizable with the grey metal doors (just leave all the ones you can go through open), It’s going to be a little bit harder with the doors with the locks on the front (seeing as the rules of restoration don’t allow me to change up existing door models, It’s going to be somewhat difficult to provide distinction between doors of that type that do open and doors that don’t). As for the layout issue, I am by no means a professional, so the layout might not be 100% optimal. However, if you could tell me which parts you found confusing, I could try to iron it out in the next update.</p>

<p>(In all seriousness, I already got early access to this one from MDG himself, so I don’t really have anything new to say about it. Glad it’s getting ready to ship, though!</p>

<p>It’d be nice if we could open large doors between storage rooms, though.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Getting the big door in Storage Area 3 to work is next on my list. I’m not sure about the doors in Storage Area 1, though, seeing there isn’t enough vertical room above the doors for them to open without clipping into the hallway overlooking the warehouse. If I can find a workaround, though, I will definitely make them usable.</p>
