    <title>Quick Idea: Something wrong with Eli and Kleiner</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/quick-idea-something-wrong-with-eli-and-kleiner/6303</link>
    <description>Okay, I was reading the FAQ like a [Sarcasm] kindhearted, good forum member [/Sarcasm] and I read something about Eli, Kliener, and Barney being the only ones to make a re-appearance in the mod. I know that, this late into development, the devs wouldn&#39;t want to change that but I have some news. Kliener wasn&#39;t the one Eli was afraid to move. It was Magnusson. For me, every time I played through HL1, the Einstein looking scientist was the one who was hurt. That same scientist was also the one who&#39;s casserole I blew up in the microwave. Although never noted in HL1 at the time, Magnusson was the scientist said to be the one with the casserole by his reference to it in EP2. Even though it doesn&#39;t make a difference which scientist was hurt in the incident, I just thought that I&#39;d put it out there that Magnusson was the injured scientist who never got his casserole, it&#39;s more true to the story. Jeez, I&#39;m a nit-picky son of a bitch.  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>…and, stemming from the Laidlaw comment, he noted that, in retrospect, he would have preferred that scientist to be the bald, bespectacled model had he known in advance the direction the character design would take.</p>

            <p>I’d like to point out that the reason it’s not a ‘bald, glasses’ scientist is because Kleiner wasn’t a character back them, same as Eli. They were both retconned in, and they decided not to make people re-download the entire Half-life GCF just because the model was wrong in two maps.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I just always saw the Einstein looking fellow at both locations and never saw Kliener at either. I just thought since the Einstein looking fellow and Magnusson had some similarities and Magnusson’s reference to the casserole, that he’d be the logical choice for the role of the guy who was hurt. In any case, it doesn’t matter. Close thread please.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>and it wasnt Magnusson sitting in the room where you blew up the cassarole, it was someone else watching the cassarole for him.</p>
