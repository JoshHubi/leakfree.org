            <p>Okay I just remembered I watched the worst movie EVER a few months ago.</p>
<p>I can’t remember the name, but the plot was something about the world being dominated by some evil stuff (machines or something), and a guy recruits a few people to go to the evil people’s “headquarters” or something, to destroy the “mother machine” or whatever.</p>
<p>I believe it had something to do with people opening some kind of seal during the WW2, and a war between continental clans or something. Seriously. Worst. Movie. Ever.</p>

<p>I saw the Director’s Cut of both, and I preferred Alien 3. I have to say, I did use to love Aliens, but it’s still too action-movie in my eyes.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to watch it again.</p>
<p>EDIT: What did you guys think of Resurrection?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s the thing about Aliens. It’s an action movie.<br>
But that’s why Aliens WORKS. And Alien 3 does not. (Well, Alien 3 isn’t bad. It’s decent. Certainly not as bad as Ressurection)</p>
<p>The first Alien worked as a horror movie because you didn’t know what it was. It’s constantly hiding, and each time you only catch a glimpse of it. This is what makes it so damn scary. Some thing’s on the ship killing everyone one by one. In the end the alien is fully revealed. And that’s where he stops being scary as hell.</p>
<p>Second horror movies never work. You already know what the monster looks like. You already know what it can do. You already know what’s gonna happen. And that’s why it was such a smart move from Cameron to turn the second film into an action movie. He KNEW alien wasn’t scary enough anymore after the first film.</p>
<p>In Alien 3 they go back to the horror idea. But it’s just not working. Yeah okay it’s a slightly new breed. But it’s nothing so special that it becomes scary again. After you’ve seen hundreds of aliens in Aliens, they kind of lose all their impact.</p>
<p>Alien Ressurection was god awfull. And I’m just not even gonna talk about what happens after that. It’s still too soon. The wounds have not healed yet.</p>
<p>By the way: Did ye hear that Ridley Scott’ll be directing a prequel to Alien?<br>
(Maybe it’s a no shit sherlock piece of info, but I dunno how widly known this is)</p>

<p>Strapped down in a chair with Legally Blonde 2 looping into one eye, and The Postman into another, you know damn well only one hemisphere of your brain will still be alive on the tenth viewing. It will certainly be the hemisphere connected opposite of your Postman-eye.</p>

            <p>Yay! I inspired like, a full page of conversation.<br>
Anyways, I agree with all these points. Alien was a landmark film in cinema and Aliens reinvented the franchise in the bestest way ever. Alien 3 on the other hand…I like to pretend it never happened, that way, when I dream I can imagine Ripley, Hicks and Newt happily bounding around the galaxy, blowing away xenomorphs, punching weasley lawyers and lighting a generally large amount of fires.<br>
As for The Postman…ughh. Somewhere around the time the main character spent a good half hour sitting on his ass, bitching to some unnatractive girl about the fact he’d been shot, I realized I’d made a huge mistake in watching this. I was 12 years old when I formulated this opinion. That’s how bad it was.</p>

            <p>It’s easy. It was poorly written, poorly thought out, and poorly acted. It’s a bad movie, and therefore easily disliked, or even loathed.</p>

            <p>I found Resurrection to be an ok film up until two things happened that shouldn’t have. They killed off the sharp-shooter for no real reason, and everything after Ripley’s sex scene with the queen was god-awful and unneeded. the whole affair just falls apart after that.</p>
<p>Yes, I like watching Dan Hedeya get the back of his skull bitten off so that he can pull off a piece of his own brain and look at it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Alien 3 has an interesting premise, yes. But it is poorly put together. None of the scares work because you can see them all coming from a mile away. The only characters that you really care about were from Aliens and are dead already. Ok, so I liked the Doctor and Charles Durning, but I also knew that both of them were going to die as soon as I started liking them. That is just how predictable the movie was.</p>
<p>It may be an interesting concept, but as it is, it just doesn’t work.</p>

<p>EDIT: What did you guys think of Resurrection?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You didn’t see a Director’s Cut of Alien3, because no such thing exists. As I said, the director almost completely disowned it. There was an attempt in the quadrilogy boxset to get a version closer to Fincher’s vision together, but that was only an attempt to resurrect something like his work-print version that was as far as he got before completely falling out with 20th Century Fox and Sigourney Weaver and whoever else was sticking their oar in, and even that recreation was done without any input at all from Fincher who wanted never to touch or see the film again.</p>
<p>Well I for one am in the mood for rewatching the first two again (not sure which version of Alien to watch - the newer Director’s Cut is not obviously better than the one Ridley Scott was happy with the first time around to me), so you should too and we can discuss them like artsy film critics.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Personally I prefer to pretend Resurrection simply doesn’t exist, my world is a happier one when I do this. The only thing I find interesting about it now is seeing how much of a prototype for the crew of Serenity the crew of whatever the smuggler ship in Resurrection was for Joss Whedon (another man who has completely distanced himself from the Alien film he worked on - he thinks the director mangled his script and having read it I tend to agree).</p>
<p>P.S., of course Aliens is an action movie - it’s one of the eighties films that pretty much <span class="bbcode-i">invented </span>the genre. It still has some nice thematic weight to it though (the first film was about rape and sex and death and the male fear of birth, the second film is about motherhood and children and the lengths a mother will go to for them)</p>

            <p>I think you meant to say that in Aliens the characters were all colourful and cool and fighting in awesomely staged action scenes with Stan Winston’s fantastic version of Giger’s aliens, whereas in Alien3 they were a bunch of indistinguishable baldies you were waiting to see get picked off by a retarded alien dog rendered in terrible CGI. The major thing Aliens and Alien3 have in common beyond Sigourney Weaver? The directors of <span class="bbcode-b">both </span>films hate Alien3.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate, the director of Aliens hates Alien3 because it shat on the ending to his film (and after he did such a great job of easing in from the slow and sterile sci-fi moodiness of Alien and picked up its story so naturally, too), and <span class="bbcode-i">the director of Alien3 hates Alien3</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">nearly took his name off it</span> because it was <span class="bbcode-i">nothing like what he wanted it to be</span>.</p>
<p>That said, I’m a long way from putting Alien3 on any ‘worst of’ list (even bad David Fincher is still good), but to say it’s better than a genre classic like Aliens is just a sin against the movie Gods and might be enough to make me stop loving you, James. :fffuuu:</p>
<p>I’m going to allow you to live on the basis that you may not yet have seen the much superior Director’s Cut of Aliens, which adds nuance to Ripley’s character, backstory to Newt and the colonists, some fucking awesome remote sentry guns, and fucking Captain Hollister from Red Dwarf in a small role.</p>
