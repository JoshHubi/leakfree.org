    <title>Black Mesa SweetFx problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-sweetfx-problem/12297</link>
    <description>Hi. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a right section for this but I need help and I hope someone will know the anwser. I download sweetfx post processing for black mesa from here : [url=&#39;https://gsngaming.com/topic/7971-black-mesa-sweetfx-v13/&#39;]LINK[/url]
Then I followed the instruction. I put d3d9 and injector in source sdk base 2007/bin and sweetfx folder in source sdk base 2007 folder. Then, when I launch the game through steam it doesn&#39;t launch even main menu doesn&#39;t show up, game just not launch. Here is a log file with error but I don&#39;t understand the problem : 
full path: c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\hecumarine\source sdk base 2007\bin\
redirecting CreateDevice
initialising shader environment
D3DXCreateEffectFromFile failed
try to use &quot;c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\hecumarine\source sdk base 2007&quot; for shader files

Anyone know what to do ? Also I have cinematic mod for half life 2 and it has sweetfx included which works when I launch cinematic mod.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I will resurrect this thread because I felt like finally playing BMS.</p>
<p>Now the game is working, except the fact that I only can launch the game in Windowed mode then change to fullscreen when inside the game. But I get HL2.exe has stopped working when trying to get SweetFX 1.5 working.</p>
<p>It looks like it’s d3d9.dll which wont cooperate, when I put the d3d9.dll and injector.cfg inside Source SKD 2007/Bin folder BMS just refuses to start.</p>
<p>I really need the sharpening effect SweetFX has in order to get a cleaner and crisper image when using AMD’s Supersampling, otherwise it’s really blurry.</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some extra info:<br>
I have SDK + SDK 2007 installed<br>
I don’t have half-life 2 installed (is it required?)<br>
I run Win7 64bit.<br>
I have the Radeon 7950 with the latest beta drivers.</p>

            <p>CeeJay. Man I just realised that I’m weird <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Even from the instruction I can’t understand how to install it properly. I put d3d9 and injector in bin, I also moved entire “SweetFx” folder to source sdk base 2007 folder because in instruction it says install Install SweetFX to \Steam\steamapps\YourName\source sdk base 2007\ and I also moved d3d9.fx and shader.fx to Source sdk base 2007 just as you said. That’s all I did at still no progress in launching game. Any ideas ? I din’t copy dxgi because it says these files are not needed for source game. BUT AFTER DOING THAT A DIFFERENT LOG APPEARED :<br>
full path: c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\hecumarine\source sdk base 2007\bin<br>
redirecting CreateDevice<br>
initialising shader environment<br>
D3DXCreateEffectFromFile failed<br>
c:\program files (x86)\steam\steamapps\hecumarine\source sdk base 2007\d3d9.fx(39,10): error X1507: failed to open source file: ‘SweetFX_preset.txt’</p>
<p>EDIT : I managed to open the game. I needed to put SweetFX_preset.txt in the source sdk base 2007 and it was in folder. But I see no difference after launching game. How to activate/disactivate mod ?</p>
<p>EDIT2 : You activate mod with scroll lock. I read it in readme. Also, antyalias must be turned off for this to work.</p>

<p>just use ENBseries, it’s faster and more advanced</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>ENBseries have some advanced effects that SweetFX do not, but SweetFX also has effects that ENB lack.<br>
SweetFX is however clearly faster and much easier to tweak the settings for.</p>
<p>You can chain them and use both at the same time BTW.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>From the description and the log it sounds like you forgot to put the .fx files in /source sdk base 2007/</p>
<p>I wrote instructions on how to run Black Mesa in Game_compability.txt which you can find in the SweetFX folder.</p>
<p>Here it is :</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>** Source SDK 2007 based mods **<br>
(like Black Mesa)</p>
<p>Install SweetFX to<br>
\Steam\steamapps\YourName\source sdk base 2007\</p>
<p>but put d3d9.dll and injector.ini in<br>
\Steam\steamapps\YourName\source sdk base 2007\bin</p>
<p>For source games dxgi.dll and dxgi.fx are not needed as it’s a DirectX9 engine so you can delete them if you want or leave them be - it doesn’t matter.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Also note that you will probably have to disable MSAA in Black Mesa - This is not a requirement for all games but if I remember correctly you need to do this with the source engine.</p>
<p>There is also a preset for Black Mesa in the SweetFX presets folder. I made it for 1.2 but it should still be compatible with 1.4 (if not let me know)</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy my mod.</p>
