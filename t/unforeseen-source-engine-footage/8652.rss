    <description>Gray Horsfield, who has worked on movies like King Kong and Lord of the Rings has left Valve. He worked for them from 2006 - 2012.

Now, new videos reach the internet which show new, unseen scenes from the Source Engine.

There were rumours many months ago, that Valve was working on a space game. The scene with the swarm could be the space game SOB.</description>

            <p>Valve don’t use ironsights because they’re not necessary, and they’d rather stick to the run-and-gun gameplay they’ve always had, and been successful with, than jump on the bandwagon of “realistic” games that are often anything but. Personally, while I probably could get used to them, assuming the animations and models were good, I dislike ironsights in games. A story/action-based FPS doesn’t need them. I can see them in FPSRPGs where the focus is survival, and Tactical Shooters, as DiePoente said (a rather over-saturated subgenre, IMO), but no other subgenre requires them in any way.</p>
<p>Oh, sniper rifles, too, but that would require they actually use a refractive scope shader on the model instead of the archaic HUD-based shit we usually get these days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of Valve’s upcoming- CS:GO is kind of weird looking. If it weren’t for the lack of iron sights and the addition of foley from previous games, it would be easy to mistake the game for Call of Duty 4 from the visual style alone. The weapon animations are better looking by far but that’s something you could fix with weapon model swaps in CSS. There’s some nice physics on display for the Lake beta map but ultimately it just looks like a cosmetic update.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The game price won’t be over $ 30. The team is smaller, because it’s a download only title. It is a bit different than CSS. 5vs5 teams, new weapons, new modes and new maps.</p>

<p>Me too.</p>
<p>On a side note, why do Valve hate ironsights so much? I can’t think of any other FPS developer who doesn’t put ironsights into their games. Also, I’m really not a fan of the CS:GO animations; they look a little awkward to me. Has anybody seen the City17 Episode 1 animations? Those are much more realistic than Valve’s ones, and they have ironsights too.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Valve are developing CS GO with Hidden Path entertainment. And I think I’ve read somewhere that they are responsible for the 3D models and animations.</p>
<p>And I guess Valve doesn’t use Iron Sights because their games aren’t tactical shooters.</p>

            <p>Speaking of Valve’s upcoming- CS:GO is kind of weird looking. If it weren’t for the lack of iron sights and the addition of foley from previous games, it would be easy to mistake the game for Call of Duty 4 from the visual style alone. The weapon animations are better looking by far but that’s something you could fix with weapon model swaps in CSS. There’s some nice physics on display for the Lake beta map but ultimately it just looks like a cosmetic update.</p>

<p>Blasphemy, burn the heretic!</p>
<p>But to be fair at this stage, we know more about SOB than HL3 at this stage so anything looks pretty at this point (Though looking at that video, those scenes certainly looked impressive).</p>
<p>One thing that I am intrigued with is knowing whether SOB is even running on Source, I thought the engine didn’t like open spaces that much (and space is one great big, eh, space)</p>

<p>I’ve given up all hope of seeing HL3 or Episode 3. We’ve been waiting for 5 years without any sort of indication that the project is even being worked on.</p>

</aside>
<p>I can stop you right there and say that a recent interview with the voice actor of Dr.Kleiner clearly states that there is a new Half-Life game in progress.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve heard from people who have gotten a tour of Valve HQ and they said they saw a lot of concept art for Half-Life and Valve’s new (yet unnamed) “mysterious space game”.</p>
