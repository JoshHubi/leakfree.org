    <title>Force Black Mesa to run on custom resolution?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/force-black-mesa-to-run-on-custom-resolution/11420</link>
    <description>After playing with Source ingame recorder for awhile, I decided to record my Black Mesa playthrough again with 1080p quality. Since my laptop only supports up to 1366x768, is there anyway to force Black Mesa to run on 1920x1080 resolution?

I&#39;ve tried the custom launch options (-w 1920 -h 1080) and forced windowed mode as well but the game always automatically closed before the background map even load up.</description>

            <p>my GPU can easily run on that resolution (NVIDIA GT 525M). Too bad I was short on cash so I couldn’t afford the higher resolution screen for my laptop :meh:</p>
<p>I read several articles about custom resolution on valve developer wikia and they seem to imply that you could run on unsupported higher resolution, like this one: <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/How_To_Take_Artistic_Screenshots" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/How_To_Take_Artistic_Screenshots</a></p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure you can only go as high as your monitor/GPU will allow. Otherwise you’d probably fry your everything.</p>
