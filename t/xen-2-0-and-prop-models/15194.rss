    <title>Xen 2.0 and prop models</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xen-2-0-and-prop-models/15194</link>
    <description>Going to do things a bit different than what I usually do, I&#39;ll give some background on how we are doing the levels and then show some of the small props I have been making. So we posted new images today to go along with the summer sale showing new images from the map Xen.  C4a1a which is where all the images have come from so far (except for my wire frame shots)  is a desert like area that is quite rocky and has many different islands. Adam, Shawn and I have been detailing the map using 3dsmax and a plug-in called WallWorm (WW) developed by Shawn Olsen (a team member and creator of the program, buy it it is great you will need Max though).  Our process is to import a vmf that a LD has already made and has been divided up into a instance for ease of bringing back into hammer later. Once in Max we can turn all the displacements into a sculpt mesh and sculpt it very easily. We also can vertex paint 4way blended textures onto the mesh. We also can sculpt the mesh to form around pretty much anything. Our next task is to place and scatter various props around that need to added to specific areas. We use an importer from WW to import either single source .mdls or large numbers of them into the scene. We can either place each prop by hand or use one of paint functions to paint props on the mesh or just shift drag them (copying them) . This is a pretty intensive process, but can be quite fun. We have rocks that are modular and can be rotated around to look different. We also have some large rock props that are used to cover larger areas. These all match our base rock texture.There is then a foliage pass that is either hand placed or in the case of the grass and some other plants scattered using a powerful program called forest. Once every thing is finished we collapse back to displacements, group props, cull polys, create collisions for the new groupings and export the vmf. The LD then takes and tweaks it all doing the optimizing,lighting scripting etc. By using this pipeline we can get really natural looking vegetation and rock formations. These end up being a lot more dense than doing it in hammer.
Here are a small sampling of the models I made to be scattered around in Xen.

These are the shots used in the media release just a bit bigger. Tree textures are just placeholder.

            <p>XEN has been out for ages. Just go to the Betas tab in the game properties, and for “password betas” type in “Will gordon have a helmet in Black Mesa?” to gain instant access to it’s glory.</p>
<p>We weren’t supposed to tell people who ask for Xen, but I got so tired of it that I decided to spill the beans.</p>

            <p>The new Xen or what we’ve seen of it gives me Avatar vibes. Not that that’s a negative thing, Pandora had a very ethereal and surrealist thing goin’ on. But i’ll admit it makes me think more of where the Vortigaunt race originates from.</p>

            <p>There are issues with alpha on cards (or model parts) and having them light up. We had the programmers work on it but the result wasn’t something that we were really happy with. The textures for pretty much everything in the swamp are done, I just finished a massive 2nd pass on  it, there should be some media released soon ish.</p>

            <p>These are awesome! I can’t wait to see more!</p>
<p>Question: I know you said their textures are place holders but will those trees with the orange leaves glow? Cause it would be pretty sweet to walk through a swamp filled with glowing trees and whatnot.</p>

            <p>It is annoying to have to read through a thread with nothing but requests that are off topic and and questions that have nothing to do with the content of the thread. Also people seem to think that we should change something based on x (when x is their personal peeve etc). It got so bad before that I locked most threads and temp banned people for not following the rules, or the other option was to stop doing these blogs about props. Just look at the steam forums, people are too lazy to read stickies or do a search. I don’t want to waste a lot of time re-answering derailed threads. If we interact with people they think it is a license to ask whatever questions they want anywhere they want. There are specific threads to do that. That is why there are very narrow rules regarding how these threads work. If you have read all 15 or so threads you would understand what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>In regards to interacting with Xen props, other than 1 or 2 instances you can’t interact with then they are static or animated.</p>

            <p>Solution’s simple; talk about the thread content. If you wish to talk about stuff not in the thread, go to a different thread or make one.</p>
<p>Getting pestered about unrelated stuff is a hassle and kind of a spit in the face (“I know you just showed X but can you show Y instead”), and they’re not really into putting up with it. Derailment in the “official” threads is very looked down upon. Speaking of which…</p>

            <p>I see that and obviously the velocity’s comments were inappropriate but I get a strong hostile feeling from the devs. I mean people have to apologize when they ask something or say something in fear of being banned for going out of topic. Its not like these threads get an insane amount or reply’s to keep up with.</p>

            <p>Jeez why are the mods so hostile? Starting to not like the vibe I get from these devs from time to time. I mean the guy just  asked if you could show what the new version of some old xen props look like. You know a simple no suffices instead of threatening bans left and right like its purposeful thread sabotage. Anyways, I really like the foliage of xen that you guys are creating it really makes xen look alive and foreign. I have high hopes for the coming xen levels.</p>

            <p>Great job in here, sir.<br>
Love the way you manage to find your own workaround to push Hammer’s limits.</p>
<p>Love the foliage-dense vision of yours. Makes Xen a really wild place, interesting and creepy in the same time to explore.</p>

            <p>You can just use the rocks in hammer. Where you will run into issues is with the number or props hitting the entity count. WW/max just allows us to group them and get more on the level. You can place 100 grass models and group them so they count as 4 or 5 entites. There is also a ton of other tools in WW/max that it a lot faster.</p>

            <p>How flexible are the pre-existing props, and how available are the tools used to make them for modders? If I wanted to make new sections of Xen, could I just assemble the existing rock sections differently to suit whatever structure I want to make, or are the sections large enough that they determine the overall shape of the level by themselves? If I wanted to make new sections, would I <span class="bbcode-i">need </span>WW and Max, or can a similar result be produced in Hammer (presumably just with more work)?</p>
