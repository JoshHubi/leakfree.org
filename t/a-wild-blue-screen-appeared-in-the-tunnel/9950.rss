            <p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>Yesterday I’ve got the same problem with switching to the “Blue screen” near toxic lakes. And I’ve found solution that works for me.</p>
<p>I turned on HDR in the advanced video options. And picture had come back to normal, and become more shiny and beautiful that it was. And perfomance had not decreased.</p>
<p>So I decide not to turn off  HDR any more.</p>
<p>I hope it will help all of you.</p>

<p>I wonder if that’s related to the annoying film grain effect that appears when you are in radioactive areas (I personally haven’t had the glitch you have). I wonder why they put that film grain effect in…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The effect is supposed to similar to any video footage taken in Chernobyl in areas of high radioactivity… the radiation causes a grain effect on the film. Of course, human eyes cannot see that effect. But STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl used the effect as a visual indiactor of being in strong radiation (rather than just having the Geiger counter clicking).</p>
<p>There is an age-old debate as to whether Gordon has a helmet on his hazard suit, and whether your HUD (heads up display) is an actual display on a screen in front of your eyes or whether it is just a videogame representation of stuff that is actually on little screens on your chest or arm or whatever. If you do have a helmet that has a heads-up display, then its conceivable that display is getting interference from the radiation.</p>

<p>This is impossible. Last time ATI updated the drivers for my videcard was in 2010 :’( Would be nice if it’s possible to disable that effect in order to play these levels.</p>

</aside>
<p>The CPU and Video Drivers are the issue here. They are fairly old. Can you try upgrading your video driver? The issue at hand here is whenever you seen anything toxic in the game, there is a overlay of film grain on your screen. This effect is not currently supported by your out of date driver. Try upgrading, in the meantime. I will search for a way to disable that effect from the console.</p>

<p>I was unable to see that effect anyway, it might cause the problem tho.</p>

            <p>Everywhere the toxic waste is , the screen imediately goes blue/black. I have skipped the whole “toxic waste” chapter using a quick save of a friend of mine… Not cool.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

</aside>
<p>I had the same issue. The old HL1 cheat codes still work with Black Mesa, so look em up you can bypass this a couple different ways:</p>
<p>1-Figure out which map code takes to the next level and just skip this part<br>
2-basically the same idea, only using noclip. For me, as long as i stayed far enough above the toxic waste (which seems to cause the problem) i was fine. Just fly your way in the the big toxic chamber with the elevator. Here you’ll have to fly into the elevator i/o/t progress. The elevator is close enough to the toxic waste that the screen’ll go blue/black. If youve noticed, muzzleflashes still illuminate the world. Fire your weapon in order to see the elevator button, press it, and you elevate to the next “loading” screen. Once it loads, things should return to normal.</p>
<p>Also, in Black Mesa, you don’t need to change anything to activate cheats. Just go into options&gt;keyboard&gt;advanced options and check next the console box. Then type “sv_cheats 1” to activate cheat mode and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>It’s not a “fix” but at least it’ll allow you to move on with the game.</p>
