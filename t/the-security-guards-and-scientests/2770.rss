    <description>This may be stupid, but I was wondering if you could make the SGs and the Scientests die less... easily, or be more smart as to avoid the onslaught of bees flying at them.
Because that&#39;s always bothering me in Half Life, I get a SG to join me, we go off, and he just stands there and tries to shoot a zombie as it beats him to death in less than five seconds. :meh:</description>

            <p>any HECU appeared interrogating any scientist in hl. So I doubt they will here. They are just there to kill and some want to interrogate them before killing them to know what the fuck happened and who the hell is freeman.</p>

<p>What about interaction?</p>
<p>Are the scientists and guards going to have random conversations like in HL1? I remember there was a cut event from the game when one of the guards was blaming a scientist for the disaster and was getting ready to beat the s*** out of him. That struck me as very “Mist”-like (which is itself one of Valve’s inspirations for HL). Will we see anything like that? Or maybe the soldiers interrogating the scientists?</p>

There was also another post by JamesKane (I think?) stating that their animators/faceposers are real perfectionists and have gone great lengths to ensure believable character interactions. No, there won’t be any interrogation scenes judging from what I’ve read.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is there no way for you guys to set it up so they prioritize “I DON’T WANT TO DIE!” so that they will only heal others outside of combat.  They don’t have to be field medics, but it would be a great help to revitalize friendly combatants before the next fire fight.  Oh yeah, I just thought of something: If the scientists won’t heal anyone but you, then can the npcs (Security Guards preferably) pick up health packs like the citizens?  I know the Devs are always stressing how they are not like citizens, but can they at least do that?</p>

<p>1- That is NOT black mesa. It’s opperation black mesa by another mod team and it’s Oppossing force in source, not hl1.</p>
<p>2-Read the wiki a little bit boy, the scientist will never NEVER use a weapon or defend themselves.</p>
<p>3-I don’t see why it would make it fun, I mean, yeah, pretty realistic and all that crap but fun? if you shoot him by accident he will go on rage and shoot you into your eyes!</p>

<p>For a time they had the scientists healing security guards, but it was removed due to scientists commonly getting in the players way to heal your other companions.</p>
