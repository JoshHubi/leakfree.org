    <title>Left 4 dead 2 sale</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/left-4-dead-2-sale/6007</link>
    <description>Steam is having L4D2 on sale again, obviously...and because I&#39;m deluded enough to think I have a chance at the sweepstakes, I&#39;m looking for someone who also wants it to gift the same game to each other to complete one of the objectives.  Technically it&#39;s not [i]selling[/i] games, so shouldn&#39;t be illegal...
