    <title>A Minor Suggestion.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-minor-suggestion/14480</link>
    <description>In the chapter Power Up, there is a guard in the control hub overlooking the tram depot. Since this guard is wounded, it&#39;d be a nice but small detail that if you brought him a Medkit from the lower levels, he will gratefully take it. He would obviously still refuse to go with you but he would also thank you. You could also just not bring it to him and what is currently in the game would still happen.

It&#39;s a minor detail, and there are other things you guys could be working on so I realize it&#39;s not a huge priority. It&#39;s still a nice detail and would hugely help with immersion.</description>

<p>Or just have an extra line of dialog:</p>
<p>“Thanks for thinkin’ of me, buddy, but yer gonna need it where you’re goin’.”</p>

<p>I actually really like this idea. If the developers were to ever find the time, this would be a nice bit on the side.</p>
