    <description>Why do people think Crysis is fun? The thread&#39;s kind of got a trollish purpose, but the question is genuine.</description>

            <p>You see though. Crysis is just another step into the future of gaming because it’s an open and wide game firstperson shooter. More freedom more fun. Now they just need a little work on the story and more weapons. They kinda have a limited selection of weapons from my view.</p>

            <p>I have Crysis Warhead, and that’s pretty fun.<br>
-I like it for the suit changing styles and abilities<br>
-The gameplay can sandbox to your liking, if your a stealthy gamer, you can do that. If you like to go in and attack, you can do that. If you want to be like Heavy or Brick and use your fists as WMDs, go right ahead<br>
-Scenery is very enjoyable, I can mow down a forest with my fists<br>
-Game looks pretty good with my current processor, but that will change today<br>
-Storyline is borderline between okay and good<br>
-While the battles are irritating, they are somewhat fast paced and exciting, until you die<br>
-the battles with enemies get really irritating if you get surrounded and are low on health and energy<br>
-In the first level if you skip over looking at a ship explode, it can glitch where you can’t destroy the reinforcement tank and finish the level, which forces you to restart or reload<br>
-You die a lot for really stupid reasons in battle</p>
<p>Now after making this list, I don’t really realize why I like Crysis. I guess it’s the Sandbox ability. But overall, it’s just one of those games that you either like it, or don’t.</p>

            <p>Pretty much if you are one of those types of people who watch movies and play games like your in a movie, Crysis is going to suck. Not a grand story, not even hardly a story at all, and it is hard to have a fast moving story when the landmass you have to travel across to get objectives done is massive.</p>
<p>But if you are one of those “there’s no story so I’m just gonna make my own fun” (throwing chickens at koreans and chopping forests down with turtles, Etc) you will love the game because of the large amount of freedom it provides.</p>

<p>Looks like it could go either way.</p>
<p>EDIT: The blood looks way better! Not realistic, but cooler. I hope they have two versions for this (uncensored and censored) because most of the potential “sandboxyness” of Crysis died when you couldn’t pick up or inteact with dead bodies. Speaking of which, I hope you can still grab enemies by the neck. They’d be fucking idiots to take that out.</p>

</aside>
<p>A fucking decade and only 3 official games released in that time is “milking”?</p>
<p>Franchises that started AFTER 01 have MORE games than Halo, but no one says a fucking word about those.<br>
Milking a franchise is putting out a shitload of installments in a short amount of time. It’s a display of desperation. And sure, the Halo formula has gotten DAMN stale (but it’s become a charming retro feel now that no one else does it… part of why I’m drawn to it), but it’s no where NEAR desperate for cash. No milking required. Anyway, this thread shouldn’t have anything to do with Halo.</p>

            <p>That’s pretty much my feelings on C1.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m e bit hopeful for crysis 2. Since they’re holding themselves back, they might stop trying to “push the boundaries of the generation” (which means dicking around making a game look better than it needs to while skimping out on EVEYTHING else) and try to… idk… make a game? Could be the first ENGAGING crytech game since farcry.</p>

<p>Why do people think Crysis is fun?</p>

<p>Because you can cut down half a forest with a fucking machinegun!:retard:<br>
But seriously, Crysis is, or was, trully groundbreaking. The game itself wasn’t actually all that great. It just looked really good. The fun is actually in the engine itself, you can do lot’s of awsome shit with it. But for the most part the game isn’t all that fun.</p>

            <p>You guys know I have never played crysis and didn’t plan to but more and more this thread is convincing me to play it.  And correct me if i am wrong but this thread is telling me</p>
<p>Pro’s<br>
-Open ended world<br>
-Great graphics/physics<br>
-Ability to dick around (one of my favorite things to do in a game)<br>
-Necessity to use tactics to win</p>
<p>Con’s<br>
-Poor story line<br>
-Poor AI<br>
-My PC will probably run it worth shit and I’ll be butt hurt</p>
<p>1 more pro then con to me so… why is all this bashing going on?</p>

<p>[…] And you usually have to run and hide if there are more than 3-4 enemies, even on EASY (you could call that combat realism, but considering you are wearing a nanosuit that allows you to jump like 25 feet high and run at 50 MPH, I say where the fuck does realism enter the picture?).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I would say this is a nice feature of the game. Well, I never really played it, but one thing I like to do in FPS’s is to think about how to take one enemy at a time, or finding a good spot, a good path, the right weapon. This way it is not an “ability” game, but a “tactics” game. I always play on some dificulty above “medium”. If you can face three enemies while they are shooting at you without having to seek cover, the game is too easy. Unless you are hidden in a very good spot, in which case you are using your mind in a positive way.</p>
<p>I am currently playing Far Cry. It is also a open-wide game, I love it. It is very fun to play because you can find a good cover, spot or path and take down the enemies one by one. Most of them don’t even know what hit them.</p>
<p>And some enemies say “I have a bullet with your name on it.” Then I get them from behind, kill them before they even see me, and think “Too bad you ain’t gonna use it, bitch.” :freeman:</p>

            <p>Crysis had some really great ideas. I love the idea of open-ended gameplay. I love the nanosuit - power armor with stealth camo. I also love how it looks great even if you can’t run it on maxed-out settings, and winding through that alien zero-G cave only to emerge on a flash frozen tropical Island was amazing and epic.</p>
<p>But Crysis also has some serious shortcomings. The voice acting is shit. At heart, it’s another goddamn military shooter (I hate space marines, I hate normal marines, I hate any scenario that puts you as a mindless grunt taking orders from some superior officer. It’s LAZY, HACKNEYED writing that gives us this endless barrage of military scenarios in shooters. It’s done, it’s played out, it’s rarely any fun). You have to manually pick up a weapon every time you need ammo, which is just annoying (apparently they fixed that with warhead, but I can’t be bothered to play it). And you usually have to run and hide if there are more than 3-4 enemies, even on EASY (you could call that combat realism, but considering you are wearing a nanosuit that allows you to jump like 25 feet high and run at 50 MPH, I say where the fuck does realism enter the picture?).</p>
<p>I’d give the game 2.5/5</p>

<p>I hadn’t seen Aliens for a really long time, then I watched it a year or two ago and I lol’d at just how much Halo had borrowed from it. Just look at Sergeant Johnson. He has <span class="bbcode-i">exactly</span> the same character as Apone. Tough black dude with a moustache? Check. Wears a patrol cap? Check. Smokes cigars and spouts one liners about the marines? Double check.</p>
<p>The Pelican is the UD-4L dropship:<br>

<p>The Pillar of Autumn is the Sulaco:<br>

<p>The assault rifle is…crap I was gonna say pulse rifle, but that actually looks more like the Sulaco than the Pillar of Autumn<br>

<p>Anyways the point is - even if you think you have an original idea, chances are someone’s done it before, so just make sure (1) nothing is blatantly and obviously stolen, and (2) that you make something good enough that no one will care much you stole. Crappy games steal. Good and great games “are inspired by”.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
