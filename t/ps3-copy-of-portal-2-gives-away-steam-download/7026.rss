    <description>Hey guys, so for those who didn&#39;t know the PS3 version on Portal 2 supposedly comes with a code for a free download for Portal 2 on Steam. Obviously its asking alot but if someone nice enough in the community would be so gracious to send me there code I would very much appreciate it. I don&#39;t wanna ask people to just hand it out but i figured if anyone without an intention of activating their code, they could decide to let it sit there or let me bask in the glory of the new game. I thank whoever in advanced very much!</description>

            <p>Oh I may be wrong about where to enter the code. I’m sure you still have to prove you own the PS3 version by linking your Steam ID with PSN ID, otherwise the system is open to abuse like that of which you are asking.</p>

            <p>The code won’t work with Steam on the PC, you have to enter it on the PS3 to unlock your PC version and to play online with the PS3. It really isn’t that hard to understand.</p>

            <p>In order to play online with portal 2 you have to enter the code in steamworks on PS3. This then entitles you to the steam PC version too. If someone were to give you their code it would mean they forfeit playing online coop, which at the moment is impossible for PS3 players anyway.</p>
