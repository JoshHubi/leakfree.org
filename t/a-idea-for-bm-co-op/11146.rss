    <title>A idea for BM: Co-op</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-idea-for-bm-co-op/11146</link>
    <description>Obsidian Conflict has risen to power as the sven coop for the source engine (mostly because the sven team still havent started development of sven coop 2)

Many mods (like c17 episode 1, mistake of pythagoras, neo tokyo to name a few) have been mount-able for OC, why not add BMS to this esteemed list?

a co: op for BMS could also follow Half life: decay&#39;s direction, where it would be more of a peer-to-peer style (ie. invite your steam friends to play kind of p2p)

a pub-style coop would be handled in OC</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>sven coop 5.0, thats when they will resume development of svencoop 2</p>
<p>but seriously that OB update for old source games really did purge the coop scene in source mod community, but after that time, the mod community for source is back on its feet, (and BMS of all things is a pheonomenon to say the least) its a great time to revive the coop scene.</p>
<p>either huge competition between OC and sven coop 2 will ensure, or a merge will occur, creating one big source coop juggernaut</p>

            <p>they’re never going to stop updating sven1</p>
<p>when they do, it will be because they have quit altogether</p>
<p>and personally I left sven after 3.0</p>
<p>just doesn’t feel the same as before</p>

            <p>Anyone remember Synergy, before it turned into utter shit?<br>
Orange Box Engine more or less killed the Source Modding scene to me.</p>
<p>Synergy:<br>
-Tons of servers for both the HL campaign and custom maps.<br>
-A server or two with puzzle maps 24/7.<br>
-That one server running the fun as balls fishing map.<br>
-About 200 unique custom maps, or even more. I would start the mod up every day and eventually play through one new map every time. The mapping scene for it outgrew even Zombie Master.<br>
-Fun player models.</p>
<p>Then Synergy OB came out and both mods died within the first month.</p>
<p>Synergy OB:<br>
-Nobody mapped for it. Why would they want to redo everything?<br>
-Buggy as all hell.<br>
-Nobody interested in hosting servers for it. Most servers switched from old Synergy, realized S:OB sucks ass, then stopped hosting for both after a week or so.<br>
-Nothing to do.<br>
-No more fun player models, only 5 shades of Civilians, because hurr realism.<br>
-The cool extra weapons were dropped cause hurr those weren’t in HL2 we changed our minds to be more mature.</p>
<p>I hope the Synergy team regret getting hyped for a shitty new engine. They killed a very fun mod and community with their obsession.</p>

<p>This.  Ultimately co-op isn’t worth the time and effort to implement.  It wouldn’t be played nearly as much as BMDM, and it would require double the effort (it would’ve been effectively a second campaign).</p>
<p>You could say “just allow more than one player in the existing maps!” but this would be unbalanced.  It would be like trying to play the Portal 2 coop on singleplayer maps.  It would be way too easy.</p>
