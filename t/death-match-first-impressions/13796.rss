    <title>[Death Match] First Impressions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/death-match-first-impressions/13796</link>
    <description>Hello there! First of all I want to introduce myself shortly. I am crowbar /`, leader of the HL1 competitive team Xen-Raiders since 2009 (yes, there is still a comp scene in this freaking old masterpiece) , and developer of the HD mod Half-Life: Gold. I got like 4000+ hours in HL1.

As a very experienced HL1 player I wanted to share my opinion on the Death Match part of Black Mesa. I am also curious on your thoughts.

[b]The Pro&#39;s:[/b]

[b]+[/b] I really love the maps
[b]+[/b] I like that some weapons work in a very similar way as they did in HL1. For examaple: beegun, shotgun, glock, rpg, egon, colt.
[b]+[/b] weapon models and player models are beast! Great job there!
[b]+ [/b]gaussjump is a bit weird, but at least you didnt get rid of it.

[b]The Contra&#39;s:[/b]

[b]-[/b] maybe its just the servers, but hitreg felt really bad. Maybe its just the bucking playermodels that made me think like that.
[b]-[/b] no bhop
[b]-[/b] no circle jump
[b]-[/b] no strafe jump
[b]-[/b] Longjump noise is annoying
[b]-[/b] Longjump physics are annoying
[b]-[/b] Longjump animation looks really unnatural
[b]-[/b] Gauss animation and particles look odd
[b]- [/b]no settings to change crosshairs in game
[b]-[/b] recoil of mp5


Overall it just doesnt feel like Half-Life 1 at all. Besides that, the lag and model issues are even more annoying.
Nower days Deathmatch games can only stay allive, if there is a competitive scene. But if you leave the game like that, there is no much hope of long survival.

Looking forward for updates and bug fixes.

Greetings, crowbar /`</description>

            <p>severians mod is indeed a very common modification in halflife. it has its roots back in 2001 and is still beeing played up to this day.  Basically its a serverside mod that increases shotgun damage and reloadspeed and lets every player spawn with longjump, shotgun, pistol and crowbar. Usually you also get a crossbow to spawn with (crossbow reload is also sped up). There are some other changes that i leave unnoted cuz they are not essential and unknown to most players anyway. <a href="https://www.cerious.com/severian/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.cerious.com/severian/</a> (relict of the original HP)</p>
<p>The fun comes from spamming longjumps all over the place and having that nearly instant gib feeling, since the shotgun and crossbow already are extremly deadly weapons in half life + having increased sg damage making a good placed shot on short range always an instant kill and also dealing notable dmg on medium range. Also, every time you die you come right back into the action because of the items you spawn with. This mode certainly needs infinite LJ.</p>
<p>There exist different mods of this with different spawning weapons. however, i consider removing the pistol from the spawning weapons to be retarded. I wont comment this further but i can write a book about it if u like.<br>
This mod is not part of the competitive scene but rather has its own scene in hldm. which is probably because it gives even weak players the option to move fast and giving them the feeling of making more awesome kills. A match usually usually ends at a certain fraglimit achieved by a player. some servers also offer severians teamplay with about 5 teams.</p>
<p>about 5 or 6 years ago someone created a remake (ujjl’s mod // <a href="https://www.hl.hu/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.hl.hu/</a> ) making a lot of small high quality improvements and reducing the sg damage a bit (still notable higher than in hldm) and adding smg with one nade to the spawning weapons. it was already a year or 2 later that ctf became popular in this remake aswell.<br>
Any questions about severians go to alles_ratten // longjump shotgun crossbow  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>On a separate note, the action in gasworks seems wayyyyy to concentrated in the outdoors section of the map. It makes the rest of the map feel like just a passage to the outdoors part . Additionally, in TDM, one team usually takes control of the outdoor area early on and then completely steam rolls the other team making the matches completely imbalanced and not very fun for either side. Maybe reduce the concentration of power weapons in the outdoors and increase the concentration in the indoors? Or make very limited access to health and armor in the outdoors so it’s very hard to maintain control for long. The easily accessible Gauss rifle is a huge part of the problem. The idea is that you have to expose yourself to get the weapon, but if your team has control of the area there’s no longer a risk in grabbing the weapon and you just end up with an entire team with Gauss rifles dominating anyone who dares step outside.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not at all, gasworks looks fine and is a lot of fun.<br>
The thing is when you are playing with random people then yeah you are right.<br>
If you play with a good team simply stay downstairs (indoors) and lure them out, or do a group attack once you have stacked up indoors then storm them outside.<br>
Overwhelming them from all sides, you’ve got the indoors LJ module advantage!<br>
In my opinion nothing is wrong with the map, it just needs time for people to start playing it as a team.<br>
That is where competition and clans come in  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I think the short matches makes it a little more fun, but either way seems fine to me. The important part is don’t make it team deathmatch like Arms Race in CS…completely ruins the gamemode IMO. The whole point is to race to the top of the weapons, and it feels like a lot less fun when racing to the top is about your team winning, not you winning. It just doesn’t make sense to have an FFA competition in a team setting.<br>
The more I think about this, the more hyped I get, devs, please make FFA gun game a game mode!!!</p>

<p>I sometimes played gungame in HL1DM and it was really a lot of fun. But if you add gungame you should make it 3 frags per weapon to make the matches a bit longer.</p>

            <p>Hey.</p>
<p>I think it is very important to make the gameplay fast, fluid and responsive, so I agree with a lot of points raised earlier in this thread (crowbar, fury, rammy and others) and they should be taken in consideration.</p>
<p>One more think i would like to add: Could you please make the weapons more visible? You should make them float (Like in Quake 3) or add a strong colored light under them (like it was in gta 4). There is a lot of detail in these maps and most of the times it is very hard for me to see the weapons.</p>

<p>[…] We’re buzzing with cool ideas for other gamemodes so hearing from the community what you guys would want to see would be pretty helpful. […]</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Other popular modes are Arcade and “Severians Mod” (I think you can better call this mode “shotgun&amp;bow”).</p>
<p>Arcade is pretty much like free for all, but each player spawns with all weapons, full health, armor and the longjump-module. Whenever you kill somebody, you get an instant recharge to full ammo, full health and armor. Maybe it should not recharge you up to 100 / 100, because that’s a bit extreme. I’d recommend to make it more like a vamp-mode (Whenever you deal damage to your opponent, you should get few health and armor back…) This mode is mostly used to warm up.</p>
<p>In Severians Mod (I call it shotgun&amp;bow) each player spawns with a shotgun, a crossbow and the longjump module. You should not have a pistol and no crowbar, too. This gamemode is mostly played in Free for all, but in the past months it became popular for Capture the Flag, too (personally I would prefer a normal CTF-Mode, because I hate Sev).</p>
<p>Some tips about CTF gameplay &amp; map design:<br>
When designing a CTF map, it’s very important to make the map symetric. CTF should be based on Teamwork. That means that there should not be too many powerful weapons/items inside a base. A team should be forced to share their ressources strategicly.<br>
Each base should have only few entrances (maybe 2 main ones and/or 1 hard to reach / secret one) and the Flag should not be placed too far inside the base.<br>
Playerspawns should be somewhere behind the flag and they should be behind some kind of gate. Atleast it should not be too easy to farm the enemies spawn for too long. If players spawn in seperate “spawning-rooms” (similar to how it is in Team Fortress), they can get some weaker weapon and/or few armor before they open the gate to enter their own base.<br>
You should put 50 health near the flag (so some player can defend the flag and recharge after a successful defense).<br>
You should put 25 hp near the middle of the map (25 hp for each team) to give attackers the possibility to recharge on half the way. Ofc the healthpacks in the middle area should not be placed on the middle of your route, but a bit off (so flagstealers don’t get the chance to recharge quickly). I would be rather careful with placing armor, because CTF should be a movement based gamemode and fast killing (I would still like to see bhop in future… or atleast strafe and circlejumps).<br>
Fast jumping (Gauss- and Longjumping) is really powerful in CTF gameplay. So I suggest to put only 1 Longjump-pack and 1 gauss with 20 uranium in each base. This would allow some interessting strategy… The Gauss could be timed by one player of a team (for example the flag defender). He could collect the gauss a few times in a row and afterwards he could attack the enemy flag together with his team. The longjump and the gauss should not be placed in spawn-rooms, but they should not be easy to steal either.<br>
The Egon is a very powerful weapon. Since it shares ammo with the Gauss, it should not come with too much uranium. I would suggest to place one egon with ~40 uranium and ~30 armor in the middle of a map. This way the middle area would be an important place to control to get your team some important item-advantage.<br>
I would not place any satchels or trip mines in CTF maps, because these are completely lame in a gamemode full of rushers. If you still want to place any of these inside a CTF map, I would suggest to place 1 on each side, and they should not be available inside your own base. CTF should mainly be played with SMG, Shotgun, Magnum and the RPG. The Hivehand could also be unbalanced in CTF (imagine 2 or more enemies shooting a flag-carrier with hivehands) so I would not place too many of them.</p>

<p>How do you guys feel about the ammopacks player drop when they die. In the original half-life you could only pick up the last weapon (+ammo) used by that player.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with what you stated… Only the last used weapon &amp; ammo should be dropped after death just like in HLDM. It was fair and “realistic.”</p>
<p>As for how many consecutive long jumps you can do, I think 2-3 is a good number. Maybe even 3. I know people have been talking about bunny hopping. I think the movement speed just needs to be increased &amp; more reactive. When gauss jumping or long jumping, you feel “stuck” in air. Strafing in mid air should yield some movement.</p>
<p>I am glad the devs are listening to the community. I hope this game continues to evolve &amp; mods/maps/models begin to develop at a rapid pace  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> .</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So it looks like there’s a lot of competitive HL1 <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> M players here, so hopefully the first impressions of someone who has been following BM for forever and loved HL1 but was certainly never competitive will be useful. I’ll be mostly noting complaints here and it’ll make me sound very negative, but that’s just because I think they’re the most important to bring up. I’ve been having tons of fun with the multiplayer.</p>
<p>-The maps feel way to dark and difficult to read to me. Brighter textures brighter lighting and general readability improvements would be very much appreciated, especially contrasting details to draw the player’s attention to weapon spawns. I think this is the single most needed improvement at the moment.</p>
<p>-In my own shitty description, shooting people feels “off” in a vague difficult to discern way. Others have been complaining about the models and lag with respect to hit registration, I suspect that’s what I’m experiencing. It’s most noticeable when using the pistol which I find to be incredibly unpleasant to use as its low damage and mediocre rate of fire make the problems all the more noticeable. Using the gluon gun also feels off, I don’t seem to be hitting people when I feel like I should be.</p>
<p>-Snarks should run around wildly until they die or find someone to attack instead of just standing passively. It makes them feel more threatening and more like living creatures.</p>
<p>-When scrolling through a category of weapons by clicking on a number key weapons you have picked up but no longer have ammo for should be skipped over so you don’t have to press the number key extra times.</p>
<p>-The shotgun is really overpowered. It has an insanely fast time to kill, is a relatively common pick up, and its falloff with range doesn’t matter because the maps are CQB. It’s the strongest weapon in the game IMO (except for maybe the Gauss Rifle). It could use a nerf. Also there’s no reason to ever use its secondary fire over its primary since I’ve fond in many cases one shot is enough to kill. Nerf the primary and leave the secondary alone? EDIT: after more playing I’ve decided this opinion was a little bit exaggerated, but still to an extent true.</p>
<p>-Satchels don’t seem to do that much damage or have a very large damage radius. The disadvantages of the weapon should be compensated with tons of damage over a larger area.</p>
<p>-Kill feed should have some indicator for headshots</p>
<p>-High tiered weapons (gauss rifle especially) feel way too available while mid tiered weapons (such as SMG) feel way too few and far between. Increasing the respawn timer on high powered weapons and replacing some of their spawn points with mid tiered weapon spawn points would help.</p>
<p>-Health Kits and suit power both glow blue, makes them hard to distinguish, would be nice if health kits glow green to differentiate them.</p>
<p>Will add more as I keep playing.</p>

            <p>How do you guys feel about the ammopacks player drop when they die. In the original half-life you could only pick up the last weapon (+ammo) used by that player.</p>
<p>However, in BMS, you even get ammo of other weapons. I don’t like that because in death match games you normally should time weapons and ammo and also if you are in an 1on1 and get killed by your enemy several times in a row, you should be able to “steal” items in front of him, so he cant pick them up and forces him to take other routes to stack himself up.</p>
<p>What’s your opinion on this?</p>

I think it could be like this: 100 energy pool, 40 for a jump, 20 per second.<br>
So, a player can jump up to 3 times - the last 20 needed for the third jump will be recovered during the first two. But if he jumps 3 times in a row, he will have to wait significant amount of time (2 seconds) to jump again. Probably too long, hard to say without testing it, but anyway, such things can be cvars.</p>

<p>I am quite liking that particular balance idea. Adds a bit of depth. I’ll look into it as a potential first implementation.</p>

            <p>So, first futile steps in deathmatch made… and disconnected immideatly. My Ping is up in the Sky, don’t know if that’s the current server or my lame ass bandwidth or whatever… but could be a source for optimazation. Second: The spectate system is from the normal Source games, right (I remember it from CS:Source… gosh, it’s ages ago since I stepped into multiplayer shoes) ? Any chance to overhaul or improve it ? I dislike it big time. It’s just clunky and outfashioned to me. Another problem I get is, I can’t change the spectator camera. It opens the option menu, but shows no other camera modes. Another nice add would be to have some kind of explanation how to change it, how to open the spectate menu and so on. May seem useless and obvious to most multiplayer ( source) gamers, I just did random key hitting to figure out how to open it.  Another “newbies” in multiplayer might need a few hints for some features. Also, BM Multiplayer frequently crashes for (yet somehow, I’ve only found one dmp.)<br>

<p>The idea we’re having at the moment is to have it be something like charge based. You have 100 long jump charge, and a jump consumes 50 charge. You recharge at a steady rate, and will recharge 100 in something like 2 seconds. This lets you do 2 consecutive jumps before waiting for a recharge. If you are impatient and need to jump again, you don’t have to wait for a full charge, you could jump again when it charges back up to 50. We already have a meter which shows up on the screen the cooldown for the longjump, we can repurpose it to illustrate this charge.<br>
This is just an idea I’m toying with at the moment, what do you guys think? How many consecutive long jumps would you like to be able to do? We don’t want to allow infinite jumps, so please don’t suggest that as an option. 2? 3? 4?</p>

</aside>
<p>One Mode that I can definately recommend is the Arena-Mode. This mode basicly is a round based 1v1 mode where multiple players can be on a server and the gamemode puts 1 player vs another. These two players play against each other with the full arsenal weapons, full health, armor and the longjump. When one player kills the other, he as the winner will play against the next player in the queue. This mode is very popular on not too complex maps with about 4 to 6 players on a server.</p>

This Lj in itself is similar to rolls in console games, they usually make you invulnerable, and once you learned it, the game becomes very easy.  On the other hand, if you add energy management which wont let you just spam rolls, the game will become harder - look at dark souls for example, its roll system looks pretty competitive for me.</p>

</aside>
<p>In my opinion, what made hldm so successful was the competitive nature of the game that kept people coming back for more. Too many games now a days never make it out of Early Access because they rush the fine details. I realize that the game will get better in time, hence Early Access. Nevertheless, we live in a NOW society where people want things to work right away and if they don’t, we move on to something else. That is why too many games that start off in beta or Early Access release to the public don’t make it because of all the early review criticism. Everyone is a critic… Believe me, I am a chef and deal with this on a day to day basis. People do not give second chances.</p>
<p>My point is… to make this games multiplayer successful, the devs must keep people wanting more. The way to do that is to make it as skill based &amp; competitive as possible. Therefore, all the things that we aforementioned in this thread about fast weapon switching, no delay on long jump, &amp; overall movement, must be addressed in order to grab and keep people entertained. As hldm fans, we do not want to see this game fall by the way side.</p>
<p>I really do enjoy this games MP so far (love the balanced recreation of classic maps). I am just giving my humble opinion and am not trying to sound negative. Let’s make this game as successful as the rest of the Half-Life series  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>-No cool down for long jump. Long jumping is an integral part HLDM tau jumping and overall fluid control. It slows down the game tempo too much by having a cool down.<br>
Nonstop lj spam was rather bad part of hl1 gameplay, so the idea of adding energy (which is also pretty logical) looks very good for me. However, sometimes in the game its necessary to do more then one jump in a row, so, as I already said before, it would be better to reduce energy cost of a single jump and reduce energy recovery rate.<br>
Of course some people like nonstop lj, but I think its better when people need to manage a resource well and spend it for distinct actions, not just spam it.</p>

            <p>These guys have a lot of love for the game.<br>
From the hassle and criticismn the dev team had about BM single player, I think near to none came from this die hard community.<br>
Imagen the competitive scene from hldm was like cs1.6 &amp; csgo now.<br>
These people can back you up with organizing tournaments, hosting servers, content creation, clans you name it.</p>
<p>There is some good criticism now about the multiplayer which shows you passion and likely can reverse when some points are met within updates.<br>
It is a recreation of the original half-life afterall.<br>
At first glance the game looks amazing, I am temped to join in.</p>
<p>Ofcourse it wont be the same, nor should it be expected.<br>
I’m not sure where you guys want to go with this project, what it is that you aim for.<br>
But think about that.</p>
<p>Its fan base is not COD oriented, nor am I saying that BM Multiplayer is that.<br>
Im trying to get a sense across.<br>
These guys know every successful ingredient that the game owes its legendary legacy too.<br>
If you want to listen and make BM  multiplayer the hl1 recreation it deserves to be this is the place.</p>
<p>Lol I just noticed I’m a cockroach   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
