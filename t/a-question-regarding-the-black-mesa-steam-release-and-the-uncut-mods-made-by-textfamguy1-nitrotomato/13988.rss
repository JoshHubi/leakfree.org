    <title>A question regarding the Black Mesa steam release and the &#39;uncut&#39; mods made by Textfamguy1/nitrotomato</title>

    <description>First of all i would like to say 20 euros well spent.  :thumbup: 

Played through quite a bit of the steam release and i must say that a lot of the changes hit me in a right way.
The MP5 feels statisfying as hell. Some voice changes are very nice. And the easter eggs are plenty!

However there is one thing that felt a bit like a punch to the stomach.
Back in the olden days when Black Mesa was a mod, there were 2 mods for it (modception) which we all  know about.
On a rail: uncut, and Surface tension: uncut really were a great addition to the game. I found myself replaying the game over and over. THese 2 mods were the cherries on the cake that completed it for me.
I was quite shocked to find that these areas weren&#39;t included in the steam version, and it makes me want to ask one thing:

Are the devs of Black Mesa and the creator of the uncut mods planning to add these areas to the game later during the early acces period, or will these mods be released on the steam workshop?

I thank you for your time to read this through, and i hope a dev can give me an answer on this.

Feel free to discuss what you lot think about the uncut mods and their place within the retail version of Black Mesa!</description>

            <p>“A couple of days” might be a bit generous, unless there’s been an update on “soon.”<br>
Can’t wait for OaRU. It was just enough to make OaR feel totally complete without dragging on (barring the office section), and excusing optimization, it felt quite up to par with BM.</p>
