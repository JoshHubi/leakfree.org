    <title>Getting Convars to stick between game loads</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/getting-convars-to-stick-between-game-loads/11192</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to get the maximum ammunition values to stick between game loads (those using the SK_Max_### convar commands).  I&#39;ve placed entries in both Autoexec.cfg and the Config.cfg, but the values never seem to carry between sessions.  

A snippet from my Config.cfg can be seen below - should this be possible?  Am I doing something wrong?  Any tips appreciated :-)

[code]
joy_wingmanwarrior_centerhack &quot;0&quot;
joy_axisbutton_threshold &quot;0.3&quot;

sk_max_357 &quot;24&quot;
sk_max_9mm &quot;250&quot;
sk_max_bolt &quot;20&quot;
sk_max_buckshot &quot;80&quot;
sk_max_grenade_mp5 &quot;5&quot;[/code]</description>

            <p>Ah, well that makes perfect sense.  I should have done a text search on all the cfg files for the string “SK_MAX”.  Thank you for the prompt and informative response  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Write the values inside “skill.cfg”. I did that with ammo limits as well as enemy health and damage.<br>
It doesn’t change afterwards, I have played through the entire game with those tweaked values.</p>
<p>Hope this helps <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
