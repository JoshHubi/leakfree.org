    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/texture-quality-automatically-set-to-low-and-micro-stuttering/11842</link>
    <description>I fixed missing texture problem by typing mat_dxlevel 90 into file autoexes.cfg. But new problem came in - every time I launch game texture quality is set to lowest value and if I try to set it to high game freezes for long time.
Additionally I&#39;m experiencing random micro stuttering, especially when door is opened. Also tried typing in the console and autoexec.cfg codes mat_queue_mode 0, limiting FPS and setting CPU affinity but nothing helps. Are there any other techniques to fix the problem?</description>

            <p>Just trust me, don’t use the dxlevel 90 command in console. Use it only in the shortcut properties, otherwise it makes performance worse and adds wait time.</p>
<p>Now that I have your specs I can clearly see that you have 1gb of RAM shared with a GPU so that puts it down to 870mb of RAM, barely enough to run XP+Steam+BM, you should upgrade to at least 2GB of RAM and increase shared memory size in BIOS, then report back.</p>

            <p>Low memory or another software/driver is overwriting your in-game settings.<br>
But that’s just my guess.</p>

<p>Performance didn’t changed. Texture quality was set to medium. But gone to low after typing in mat_dxlevel 90 and I had to wait long until it was changed.</p>

            <p>My laptop ASUS A6R specifications:<br>
CPU Type: 	Intel Pentium Dual-Core 1.6Ghz<br>
Screen: 	15.4"<br>
Resolution: 	1280x800<br>
Memory: 	1Gb DDR2<br>
Hard Disk: 	80GB<br>
Optical Drive: 	DVD Super Multi<br>
Graphics Card: 	ATI Radeon Xpress<br>
Video Memory: 	128 MB<br>
Communication: 	Modem • Gigabit LAN • WLAN • Bluetooth<br>
OS: Windows XP SP3<br>
Ok I’ll try your method. But why I can’t write into automatically executing file code mat_dxlevel 90? Is there other way not to type it every time.</p>
