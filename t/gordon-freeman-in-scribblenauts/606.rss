    <title>Gordon Freeman in Scribblenauts</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gordon-freeman-in-scribblenauts/606</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure alot of gamers here who followed E3 a bit heard about a game called Scribblenauts, where the player can type nearly any word into the DS and be able to use it in the game.

Well, watching an interview with the developers, I noticed they used a [i]veeeeery[/i] familiar word as a weapon.

Wait until around 1:23 in the video to see its greatness

Could we expect more half-life references? Headcrab, perhaps? Or Combine? I know they&#39;re kinda copyrighted, but I think Valve is a cool enough company to allow this if the developers planned this.</description>

            <p>I don’t think it is a reference to Half-Life. You can summon watermelons too, so I just think it is a side effect of how many choices are offered.</p>
<p>If you could summon the gravity gun, that would be an entirely different story.</p>
<p>It could be a reference to Half-Life, but if it is, it’s not an obvious one.</p>

<p>Yes, of all the things to spawn, in a video game, they picked a crowbar.  Not to mention that the main character is wearing an orange suit and black rimmed glasses at that time too.</p>
<p>You’re absolutely right. Obviously not a reference to Half-Life.</p>

            <p>I’m sure alot of gamers here who followed E3 a bit heard about a game called Scribblenauts, where the player can type nearly any word into the DS and be able to use it in the game.</p>
<p>Well, watching an interview with the developers, I noticed they used a <span class="bbcode-i">veeeeery</span> familiar word as a weapon.</p>
<p>Wait until around 1:23 in the video to see its greatness</p>

<p>Could we expect more half-life references? Headcrab, perhaps? Or Combine? I know they’re kinda copyrighted, but I think Valve is a cool enough company to allow this if the developers planned this.</p>
