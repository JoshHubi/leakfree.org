    <title>Non-BM Developers Speculation Thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/non-bm-developers-speculation-thread/8296</link>
    <description>While the development team has found it more practical to stay silent on the development on Black Mesa :freeman:, I thought this thread would be a good area for awaiting fans to get some resolution. 

This thread is primarily to be posted by those of you who have some kind of experience in the game developing community who would like to guesstimate the progress of Black Mesa development based on previously released info from the developers. This could also be a good area to just talk about the development process in itself and how much of a hell it can be.</description>

<p>Uhh…you really wanna promote that kind of talk here?<br>
Let’s not forget that this thread is about educated guesses about the mod’s release.</p>
<p>If we’re drifting off topic here, especially about somethink as grave as a leak or rumored leak - I’d suggest a lock.</p>

            <p>Well I guess I could provide my input - I’ve been working in the gaming industry for about 3 years now (for companies such as Microsoft and Activision Blizzard) - and I can tell you - Game Development can be a lengthy process. Even if everything is “done” - the QA process of just finding and fixing bugs - can be a lengthy process all in itself.</p>
<p>My educated guess?</p>
<p>Well consider the fact that these guys are spread all over the world, have different time zones, are NOT sharing the same office - and are probably using Subversion (project management software)- to keep the entire project up-to-date - and consider the fact that many of them probably have real jobs and/or are studying or have a family - I’d say they are doing the best they can.</p>
<p>Many people like to forget these details.</p>
<p>Also consider that because they have different people working on different parts of the game - they have to merge those together and make it look consistent.</p>
<p>It-takes-time.</p>
<p>I’d say by now they have most of the work complete, are getting all the different parts of the game together, are doing a heavy amount of testing - and it’s a matter of months.</p>
<p>They have to find every possible way to break the game to find any bugs that might stop a player from finishing the game (game stoppers).</p>
<p>Then there is balancing which needs to be tested - is it too hard, too easy.</p>
<p>Also consider the engine - for every bug fix the level needs to be re-compiled (correct me if I’m wrong) - so that takes time too.</p>
<p>I’d say the wait is almost over.</p>
