    <description>Hey guys.. I think you should higher the jump hight. The normal jump is too low. I always have to use crouch-jumps. The longjump is also not high enaugh.
In HL1 you were able to climb up 64x64 unit-crates using LJ. ATM I think that&#39;s not possible.</description>

            <p>In Half-Life 2, I literally never had to crouch-jump, so clearly something has been modified. It takes a lot of practice to do well, and all we’re asking for is some sort of automatic crouch-jump option.</p>
<p>And I swear, every time I see somebody call it a duck-jump, I want to scream.[/SIZE]</p>

<p>I don’t see the problem.  Jump height is identical to HL2 and its episodes*; if anything, you should be complaining about jump height in Source engine games in general.</p>
<p>*In both BM and HL2, you can’t jump on top of an upright barrel with the regular jump, but you can with the crouch jump.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The point is… It’s the same to HL2 and Episodes… But not identical to HL1 or HL:Source… In HL1 the normal jump was higher --&gt; less crouch jumps were required --&gt; better gameplay… In HL1 you only needed crouch jumps for getting into vents or to climb high platforms (&gt; ~44 units)</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No it doesn’t, unless you consider pressing Alt-Tab to be challenging. It’s pressing two buttons to jump instead of one. What it makes the game is slightly more complex and it allows the player to get on top of taller obstacles without the hit box problems related to a taller jump, and it allows the player to enter vents without them having to be at ground level. That’s not challenge, it’s the basic functioning of a fairly rudimentary movement system.</p>
<p>The only thing that makes duck-jumping confusing to people is the lack of a tutorial that explains it, considering Half-Life is one of the very few games that actually use it.</p>

            <p>The crouch jumping is no problem! It just makes the game that more challenging. I had difficulty in the beginning though, with jumping off the latters when Im on top. But I found that if you face towards the latter, look down, while holding D and S, press space, and Freeman jumps backwards and to the side at the same time  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, but so is jumping. I have to agree with the others - it does seem like not only is there a lot of crouch-jumping required, but there are very few instances where regular jumping works at all. It’s a bit like Ubi’s Prince of Persia getting a jump action that almost never gets used for anything since he’s almost always either wall-running or climbing. There may or may not be two or three instances in that entire game where actually jumping over a gap is even an option. Same deal here.</p>
<p>I don’t find duck-jumping hard at all, myself. Used to be my keyboard would lock my keys if I pressed too many, but after relocating to WASD, with Space being jump and F being crouch, I haven’t had any issues with it. All it takes is finding a control scheme that’s convenient for you. All I’m saying is it feels odd how much duck-jumping there is to how much regular jumping is worth.</p>

            <p>yeah, remove crouch jumping. Then add weapon mods. and killstreaks. and take out the aliens.</p>
<p>Sod it, lets just make this Call of Duty: Black Mesa.</p>
<p>K so that escalated far too quickly but still . . .</p>
<p>Crouch jumping is a key component of the series.</p>
<p>YES, THE SERIES. If you weren’t crouch jumping in Half-Life 2 you were <span class="bbcode-b">doing it wrong</span> and there’s a solid chance you were slow or missed out on load of gear.</p>
<p>And for the guy who said his hands were cramping cause he had to press W+Shift+Ctrl+Space . . . Welcome to Half-Life.</p>

            <p>A special feature of the HL series was stripped from it’s uniqueness here.</p>
<p>If it was a feature that is used for special occasions (either secrets or a hard part of a jump puzzle) it still would have been a special feature unique to the HL series.<br>
But in BM it was degraded to a normal jump that needs two keys pressed instead of one.</p>
<p>And that is the sad part here. That it became something ordinary that is nothing more than an additional key being pressed.</p>

<p>I don’t see the problem.  Jump height is identical to HL2 and its episodes*; if anything, you should be complaining about jump height in Source engine games in general.</p>
<p>*In both BM and HL2, you can’t jump on top of an upright barrel with the regular jump, but you can with the crouch jump.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Except that jumping was nowhere as much necessary in HL2.<br>
And when it was, jumping was for heights lower than a upright barrel, thus crouch-jumping was rarely necessary.</p>
<p>In HL1, jumping is a fundamental part of the game.<br>
In BMS, jumping is a fundamental part of the game.</p>
<p>In HL1, you crouch-jump to go into air vents, and over some objects, but crouch jumping is only required for at most 1/3 of the jumps.</p>
<p>In BMS, there isn’t a SINGLE JUMP where crouch jumping is not necessary.<br>
In that case, why didn’t they just make the player auto-crouch while jumping?? Just because they like to annoy us into pressing another key after jumping?</p>

            <p>I am a HL1 veteran and hate the constant crouch jumping in Black Mesa. It is easy to do, it gets me where I want to go, but having to do it all the fucking time to accomplish the most basic jumps like reaching the top of a small box? It is just a pointless, arbitrary inconvenience for the player. I’m definitely not saying it should be ditched altogether, just that it is needed to reach high places or squeezing through narrow spaces like windows or vents.</p>

            <p>Jump-crouching has never been difficult, and it’s always been tedious and a barrier to new players. I’m so used to it I didn’t even realize that most jumps in black mesa required crouching.</p>
<p>I also wonder why I ever tolerated contorting my thumb under my palm just to jump, and I do not wonder why I feel retarded when I have to explain to someone how to do it. Crouch-jumping is less threatening, but what is the point of making players commit sorcery with their fingers just to accomplish the most menial task in the game next to walking?</p>
<p>This mechanic is nothing more than a trophy for people who played PC FPS 10 years ago, it needs to go. I would be OK if jump-crouching to reach secret locations, extra items, or shortcuts; but it shouldn’t be a requirement to complete the game.</p>
<p>Requirements for crouch-jumping should stay in because it’s intuitive enough for new players to figure out on their own, and I don’t want to bother mappers with worrying about vent placement.</p>

<p>Got any statistics on that? I am more inclined to think of a reduced jump height as a usability issue, and that’s actually a developer’s responsibility.</p>
<p>The logic is pretty straightforward: a restored jump height</p>
<ul>
<li>doesn’t harm those who crouch-jump anyway</li>
<li>is less annoying for those who only crouch-jump over higher objects. I <span class="bbcode-i">remember</span> how jump priginally felt, and it is horribly wrong now.<br>
Don’t see why not do it then.</li>
</ul>
<p>“I’ve been happily jump-crouching in every FPS I’ve ever played since 1998.” isn’t a valid argument as long as the game is designed for people who may or may not have been playing FPSes this way.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Statistics for people capable of pressing ctrl after space? Okay. Most people here have completed the original Half-Life, and a lot of people here have now completed Black Mesa. The jump-crouch is <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> a usability issue. If the jumping prevented, or even hindered people from advancing in the game, that would be a usability issue. “I don’t think Gordon jumps high enough now” isn’t.</p>
<p>I don’t mind if the jump is tweaked, but people arguing that the jumping in BM is “horribly wrong” just seem silly. Especially considering it takes 5 seconds to change it yourself.</p>

<p>Hey guys… I think you should higher the jump hight. The normal jump is too low. I always have to use crouch-jumps. The longjump is also not high enaugh.<br>
In HL1 you were able to climb up 64x64 unit-crates using LJ. ATM I think that’s not possible.</p>

<p>It’s <span class="bbcode-b">JUMP-CROUCH</span>!! Ffs. Crouch-jump is longjump, jump-crouch is JUMPING <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">and then </span></span>CROUCHING.</p>

            <p>I too find the constant crouch jumping in Black Mesa a little strange. I finished the game and as far as I can tell almost every single jump NEEDS to be a crouch jump.</p>
<p>I’m curious why the devs made the decision to design things this way. I went back and played a little bit of Half-Life: Source and found that regular jumping works fine in every situation. Take the first jumping puzzle where you hop up on some pipes and then jump between suspended boxes. In Black Mesa I died about 20 times because a regular jump only propelled me a short distance and I found it difficult to get the timing down for crouch jumping. In Half-Life: Source the exact same spot is simple. You jump onto the pipes, jump onto the boxes, and 5 seconds later you’re on the other side.</p>
<p>In my opinion, requiring crouch jumping makes the game more difficult, but not in a fun way.</p>

            <p>Crouch-jumping is fine and AND will be expanded on Xen. So stop arguing and practice more.</p>
<p>The Devs make the mod with that in mind so…and  read this:</p>

<p>i don’t really recall crouch jumping in HL2 so it couldn’t have been necessary all that often.</p>
<p>there is no jumping in BM - only crouch jump. so many people are mentioning it that it’s obviously a problem, even if some people are used to it. something is wrong when a player needs to hit 2 buttons to use the jump option, you can’t just hit the jump key in BM and expect to jump on anything. i really hope they fix it, imagine what Xen is going to be like, crouch-long-jumping everywhere, man that would be a nightmare.</p>
