    <title>DM ventrilaquism.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dm-ventrilaquism/7954</link>
    <description>I&#39;m damn sure this has been grazed upon before. There&#39;s no question about this mod that hasn&#39;t been asked yet. The thing is, if it&#39;s been mentioned I haven&#39;t seen it, and I&#39;ve been here a while so...

yeah.

Would it be at all possible to animate the jaw of an MP character&#39;s mouth to open more depending on the volume of the person speaking into their mic?

[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=RXMjwvyD9IQ#t=57s[/url] Something like that.

Something simple. No lip movements in this, they look shit anyway (see uncharted 2).

I haven&#39;t the slightest clue if this is something that would have to have been set up for way early on or if it could be added in on a whim or if it could be added on a whim but won&#39;t be (most likely)... but I was more curious as to if it could even work with the current source.</description>

            <p>Although L4D did have a different set of facial animations for each character, I would imagine that if the BM team did implement this they would only use one or two sets of animations for the player models unless the npc animations could be used for it too.</p>

            <p>It might have worked back when HL1 was out, or in a game where you play as a puppet, but with the source engine’s face posing system having only jaw movement change with voices would look pretty poor &amp; would probably sync up poorly. I think Valve tried to do it with TF2 during it’s development, but it worked out about as bad as you’d imagine.</p>
<p>What would be neat is to have the player’s faces change in expression based on damage taken &amp; remaining health. Not unlike the Doom guy’s face icon. Possibly limping player animations like the human grunts in BM single player, so long as it wouldn’t affect movement speed.</p>

            <p>It’s really about how you’d make that in faceposer.</p>
<p>If I understand Faceposer’s workings correctly (And I only have a passing familiarity with it so please bear with me), the facial animation for dialog is generally done by the programmer using a phonetically based text string of the dialog in question. I’m not sure if there’s a way to control “lip spacing.” Plus, you’d have to compile in animations for what the ventriloquist is using as his medium.</p>
