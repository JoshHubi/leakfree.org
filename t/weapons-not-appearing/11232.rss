    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weapons-not-appearing/11232</link>
    <description>hey guys so i was on the level surface tension, and i went through a loading screen, but my weapons disappeared. every one, crowbar included. so i had to go pick up new weapons, but the weapon models dont appear, and every time I try and use explosives, the game crashes.

            <p>Have a similar thing here, but I dunno whether it’s a bug. Leaving “Questionable Ethics” (where you open the gate to the dam) always makes my shotgun and the Tau disappear. After killing the first soldiers and picking up a shotgun, it’s all there again: bucket image and even the ammo is it should be. Only prob is that you cannot obtain the tau again as easily as a shotgun.</p>
<p>I also suspect this to happen to frag grenades coz the slot (5 or 6) is highlighted, but i cannot go there by keyboard or mousewheel. Wasn’t sure the first three times but this time i grabbed the 3 grenades (q.ethics end battle) and did not use them. Passing through the gate to the dam they were gone.</p>
<p>Didn’t want to file a bug before asking here as I’m not sure whether it was meant as a feature. Thx in advance if someone could drop me a note here whether this is meant to be or not.</p>

            <p>What happens when you bring down the console? Could you please copy-paste everything in the console when you load a level where the weapons don’t appear.</p>
<p>Are they gone completely, or can you pick them up but not see them? If you reload a previous save, from a level further back, do they appear again?</p>
