    <title>Have Valve&#39;s updates caused delays in BM development?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/have-valves-updates-caused-delays-in-bm-development/4624</link>
    <description>Everyone knows about the update to HL2 and the episodes that have resulted in numerous glitches, as well as breaking nearly every mod in existence, but I had originally thought that the development of Black Mesa wouldn&#39;t be affected by any of these issues since it was being done on the Orange Box engine.

However, I&#39;ve finally started to dip my own toes into hammer with the hopes of getting started on my own mod and found that I was having some serious issues even getting a brush created, since all of the top, side, and front views didn&#39;t show any of the brushes I was trying to create. I didn&#39;t even know what was going on until I finally managed to find a bug list that explained that the latest souce SDK update apparently broke those camera views so they only show black.

I was just curious how the Black Mesa dev team was being affected by these issues. Has this issue, as well as other similar issues caused a slowdown in the desired production level? Have there been cases where it has stopped completely? Have the devs figured out some workaround or fix that might be helpful for my situation? Or for that matter, does this issue only have limited range, and some people are completely unaffected?</description>

<p>Okay, please read the whole thing before responding, especially when the devs at whom the question was asked already have answered. There was an update to SOURCE SDK recently. I’m ALSO asking about that one, not JUST the one for HL2.</p>

            <p>thanks, Ram. I’ll try that. (I’m assuming you mean the one that is in the vconfig folder) I had originally tried to start the SDK using the 2009 engine, but it told me it wasn’t available to use. I didn’t realize that you could get access just by editing that file.</p>
<p>I’ll let people know if it works, otherwise I’ll just keep looking for solutions elsewhere.</p>
<p>EDIT: I figured out my problem. I think I messed up the initial setup. I switched from trying to edit the mod I initiated to trying to edit HL2:Ep2 and now I get the proper grids and stuff. I’ll guess I just have to play around more.</p>

<p>Thanks. Sadly I don’t get flickers, as I am using the 2007 engine, but I just don’t have any of the brushes that I create show up visibly. I’ll see if I can try reinstalling the SDK bases as well as the SDK itself and see if that fixes anything.</p>

<p>Thanks all. But the point that I’m asking isn’t just about the updates to HL2 and Ep1, but also the update to Source SDK(not the Bases, but the actual source SDK that lets you create the mods and muck around with things) that came out just a few days ago. It was about 26MB.</p>
<p>I was also asking if the BM devs had come up with any workarounds that they might be willing to share for getting Source SDK to work the way it’s supposed to. All I’ve been able to find on the official Hammer wiki is “recent update broke top, front and side views”</p>

            <p>To clear up confusion, it looks like they did have issues but they seem to be minimal. Found this answer as well. I think the reason for the various answer is that there are devs whose jobs were not affected at all.</p>

<p>I was just curious how the Black Mesa dev team was being affected by these issues. Has this issue, as well as other similar issues caused a slowdown in the desired production level?

<p>Two questions that need to be answered:</p>
<ol>
<li>Were there problems with something to do with the source engine [during the update]?</li>
<li>If so, is that effecting development?</li>

<p>PLEASE ANSWER!</p>

            <p>I think this is a perfectly legitimate question. I’ve run into this problem myself. Unless they’ve found some sort of fix for this issue, there probably isn’t any mapping going on under the 2007 SDK.</p>
<p>They could do brushwork and perhaps some entity creation under the older (or newer) versions though.</p>

            <p>Everyone knows about the update to HL2 and the episodes that have resulted in numerous glitches, as well as breaking nearly every mod in existence, but I had originally thought that the development of Black Mesa wouldn’t be affected by any of these issues since it was being done on the Orange Box engine.</p>
<p>However, I’ve finally started to dip my own toes into hammer with the hopes of getting started on my own mod and found that I was having some serious issues even getting a brush created, since all of the top, side, and front views didn’t show any of the brushes I was trying to create. I didn’t even know what was going on until I finally managed to find a bug list that explained that the latest souce SDK update apparently broke those camera views so they only show black.</p>
<p>I was just curious how the Black Mesa dev team was being affected by these issues. Has this issue, as well as other similar issues caused a slowdown in the desired production level? Have there been cases where it has stopped completely? Have the devs figured out some workaround or fix that might be helpful for my situation? Or for that matter, does this issue only have limited range, and some people are completely unaffected?</p>
