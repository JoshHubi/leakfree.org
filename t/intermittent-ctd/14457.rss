    <description>This just started this evening. but every other time I hit the Escape key to pull up the in game menu/overlay to save the game it crashes to desktop.  The area I first noticed this in was at the end of On a rail where you encounter the final trackside grunts, all the way past the rocket launch.  Once the next level loaded (when the tram crashes into the water) I tried to save the game by hitting Escape and it crashed again.</description>
