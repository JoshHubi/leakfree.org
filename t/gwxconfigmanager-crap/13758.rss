    <title>GWXConfigManager crap</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gwxconfigmanager-crap/13758</link>
    <description>Hey, folks.

I signed up with Microsoft to be notified when Windows 10 will be available to so I can make a decision as to whether to get it or not.  Microsoft then evidently installed GWXConfigManager.exe which is evidently a program that will make sure my computer is ready for Windows 10.

That&#39;d be fine with me if the program didn&#39;t take up nearly a quarter of my CPU usage and it&#39;s been going for nearly a week now.  Anyone know how to stop this?  I still would like to possibly upgrade to Windows 10 when it comes out, but I can&#39;t take having  essentially one core of my quad core devoted JUST FOR THAT.

Thanks, everyone!</description>

<p>Just had this start affecting me today (on Windows 7) - I could hear a lot of unexpected HDD activity, so I opened Resource Monitor and found that GWXConfigManager.exe reading a bunch of different files (mostly executables).</p>
<p>After looking it up I found out it was installed as part of <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Windows Update KB3035583</a>, which is apparently supposed to “assist” with upgrading to Windows 10 by showing a Windows Update notification for it (once it is available) and possibly running compatibility checks (which might be what GWXConfigManager.exe was doing).</p>
<p>I uninstalled the update through Control Panel and the GWXConfigManager.exe process stopped.</p>
