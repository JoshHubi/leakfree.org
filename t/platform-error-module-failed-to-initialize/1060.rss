    <title>Platform error: module failed to initialize</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/platform-error-module-failed-to-initialize/1060</link>
    <description>I was compiling a new map I just started. Right as HL2DM was about to autorun my new map I decided to listen to music, so I frantically opened Zune and hit the play button. This caused HL2DM freeze. alt+ctrl+delete didn&#39;t work so I had to hit the power switch on my computer. Now I get the error in the thread title when DM gets past the blurred loading screen after starting the game. I reinstalled DM and still got the problem. I get the same error with HL2.


Please help.  :frowning:</description>
