    <title>Auto-Crouch Jump?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/auto-crouch-jump/12078</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve played through the game until about halfway through Unforseen Consequences, and one thing has just been making the otherwise-enjoyable parkour (and box-jumping) completely ridiculous. Crouch jumping has always been difficult for me, even though other gamers have it down pat; the combinations just never seem to work.

So I was thinking. Perhaps there should be some sort of auto-crouch jump implemented into the options. This would make the game more enjoyable for people who didn&#39;t start out with Half-Life 1. It&#39;s just a suggestion, and threads have probably already stated all this before, but I wanted to get this out there as a sort of introduction.</description>
