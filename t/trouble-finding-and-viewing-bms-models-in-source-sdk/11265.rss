    <title>Trouble Finding and Viewing BMS Models in Source SDK</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/trouble-finding-and-viewing-bms-models-in-source-sdk/11265</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;ve been wondering where I can find the textures and model files for the charger battery and medkit, along with where I could find a texture for the scientist name tag.

I&#39;m looking into making some props for cosplay and I&#39;d like a better look at the models for accuracy sake.

If someone could direct me to the directory where these textures and viewable models would be for the Source SDK Model Viewer or to view in Garry&#39;s mod or something similar, I&#39;d be very appreciative.

(Also, I&#39;m new to this forum, so if this has already been solved or is in the wrong board, I do apologise).

Thanks in advance, 

Ramsey</description>

<p>In Source, models and their textures are stored seperatly. A model can be found in the BMS/models folder, but their textures will always be stored in the BMS/materials/models folder.</p>
<p>Those materials are saved in VTF format. You’ll need VTF Edit to view these files. Get it here: <a href="https://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?c=178" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?c=178</a></p>

<p>Still not finding what I’m wanting, but your post gave me an idea.</p>
<p>Could someone upload the texture and model file in a zip somewhere containing the Medkit model and texture, and the battery model and texture? I’m having trouble with the SDK model viewer, so I’d be grateful with any other help on this.</p>
<p>Or, does anyone know the exact directory and filename of these resources?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
