Microsoft has quietly ended retail sales of Windows 7, according to a notice on its website.

The company&#39;s policies for shutting off sales to retailers and shipping licenses to OEMS (original equipment manufacturers) are posted on its site, which was recently updated to show that Windows 7&#39;s &quot;retail end of sales&quot; date was Oct. 30.

The next deadline, marked as &quot;End of sales for PCs with Windows preinstalled,&quot; will be Oct. 30, 2014, less than a year away.

            <p>I used Vista for about two years I think, I honestly never had any problems with it. I think I had a BSOD maybe twice.<br>
I realize I may have been lucky with the peripherals I was using though (hardly any).</p>

            <p>Back in 06 (1 year before Vista came out) I used to test beta versions and they were all relatively as stable as XP (if not more) but when the final retail build hit my PC I started getting BSOD’s and almost instantly switched to ubuntu for 2 years.</p>

            <p>win 9x was dos based, cheap(relatively) very unstable and basically indicative of what microsoftie thought of its home user base. NT was stable and $. Multi processor support, great for enterprise but lacking 3d graphics support. Win2000 hit it out of the park. Stable, easy to use, well supported, multi-processor support. Xp home blew chunks. No mp support but stable and good networking. XP pro, as awesome as win2k. I had to buy it to install microsoftie on my Mac and used it until 2012. Vista sucked so bad I never used it. Win7 has been great. Everyone I know hates win8, just like vista</p>

            <p>Horrible compatibility with Win9x software, half baked Sidebar that looked like shit, initially quite unstable/insecure. Only every other Microsoft OS can really be considered serviceable.</p>
<p>More specific example: My mom’s friend, a former Apple employee, was really pissed at how hard it was to get my Vista laptop to use her printer. Instead of being in a unified Printer UI, there was like, two separate printer programs that both had to work instead of just one. In completely different folders. It was just a royal PITA. In fact, we couldn’t get it to work at all and I just wound up sending the document to another computer in the house and printing with that.</p>

            <p>Funny how I used Vista for over 5 years and I never got why everyone hated it until I got Win7 and actually looked back at it :fffuuu:</p>
<p>though really I never found out why it was that bad sure Win7 is better but Vista somehow never seemed seemed all that different from it to me[/SIZE]</p>

<p>Which part are you referring to? The change to the clean non-bezeled look??? Or to Win8 in general?</p>
<p>You’re absolutely right, Win8’s advantages should have just been a service pack for 7 (with an optional metro UI add-on for filthy touchscreen devices). But M$ wants their money. I would never have gotten Win8 except for the fact that I was building a new rig and my Uni gives me one free copy of 8 and one of 7, and I had already used the copy of 7.</p>

It’s got a lot of features that are really nice, like the new file transfer window. And the OS just looks sooo much cleaner.</p>

            <p>To be fair, I’ve finally switched to Win8, and after hiding the MetroUI in a deep dark corner in a nailed shut crate and downloading a third party start menu, I’m loving it.

            <p>In my opinion, what justifies piracy of Windows software are two things: the presence of free alternatives that would be better if windows wasn’t simply more popular, and also, they keep extending the copyright term for 20 more years every time something important comes close to actually reaching the public domain.</p>
