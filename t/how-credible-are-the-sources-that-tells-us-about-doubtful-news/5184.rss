<p>Good rule of thumb, anything that claims news about HL2Ep3, HL3 or anything called “Source Engine 2” is BULLSHIT. If you really think it sounds plausible, look at the url. If it isn’t from <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.valvesoftware.com</a>, it’s BULLSHIT.</p>

3: The vast majority of information on the internet is either porn or spam.<br>

<p>I KNEW IT I’m going to post this all over facebook and twitter so there’s a mass hysteria over a rumor started on one fake site in the likes of <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/66425/formspring-to-reveal-users-private-data/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this formspring hoax</a></p>
<p>These kinds of things happen all the time, and while the internet is an amazing place for information, it is home to both truth and fiction, and it is up to the reader to discern it.</p>

            <p>Even the most credible sites fall victim of rumors and hearsay, so it’s perfectly normal for that kind of things to be published.</p>
<p>In fact, rumors are good for them as it brings in more viewers.</p>
