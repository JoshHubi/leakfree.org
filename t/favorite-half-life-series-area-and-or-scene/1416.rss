            <p>Half-Life: Haven’t played it very much, but I love the Resonance Cascade sequence, at the end of Anomalous Materials.<br>
Half-Life 2: The whole “Our Benefactors” level. The two pod rides are excellent.<br>
Half-Life 2 Episode One: The thrilling ride in “Undue Alarm”, the “Direct Intervention” level and the exploding Citadel at the very end of the game, when Freeman is on the train.<br>
Half-Life 2 Episode Two: The Portal Storm at the beginning and the Strider battle at the end.</p>

            <p>I’m a sucker for things that are blue. I throughly enjoyed “Direct Intervention” from Episode 1. The interior spaces and the captivating citadel core was really quite amazing. Although it wasn’t very challenging; I simply loved the the change in theme from what is stereotypically combine.</p>

<p>Half-life 1- Gotta love blast pit(Felt like you really in a decrepid part of the base).  Half-life 2- Highway 17 in-particular the bridge part ( I loved the sense of height). Hl ep 1- Waiting for that dam lift (The first time it felt like the darkness was actively trying to kill you.).</p>
<p>Hl ep Clearing out the silo before the mai assult. ( It was a very refreshing brake being on your own in a run and gun enviroment after the wide areas, and it had a very old school Half-life feel.)</p>
<p>But on The whole blast pit.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with you on a lot of those points. I’m not sure they were my favourite points, but they were close. I’ve chosen my top two in these case:</p>
<p>Half-Life:<br>
Blast Pit. There was a great combination of exploration, adrenaline, fear and clever puzzles with a <span class="bbcode-i">fantastic</span> reward. In my opinion it’s the best designed level in the entirety of HL - it just felt like very good quality.</p>
<p>Xen. There were a few points in particular that I recall where you were able to calm down and be amazed by the bizarre, lonely, majestic and fearful atmosphere of Xen. There were several moments when I was awed by what I found, such as the first crystal room, the area with the three tentacles, and the waterfall cave. They were amazing.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2:<br>
Ravenholm. I loved the feel of this whole level - the level design that wound its way all over the map, the feeling of lonliness and the sheer incredible character of Father Grigori. The zombies were the peripheral for me. They provided the fear, but it was the clever use of level architecture that put you in situations that made it so fearful, rather than the zombies themselves.</p>
<p>The Battle for City 17. Everything about the battle felt so epic. You were encountering striders, dropships, gunships, combine elite, snipers, soldiers and headcrabs. I remember recalling city battles like Berlin and Stalingrad, and this really reminded me of that. I played through both chapters in one sitting and by the end of it, felt absolutely exhausted.</p>
<p>Episode 1:<br>
Lowlife. This whole level had an incredibly palpable claustraphobic feel to it, something that isn’t done for long in HL. The use of darkness as a level design tool was something that worked brilliantly, and there was definitely an enjoyable tension throughout the whole level.</p>
<p>Arriving from the underground and seeing Kleiner on the monitor was one of the best moments of the game. Kleiner’s one of my favourite characters and was the perfect way to introduce the game’s situation after Lowlife. The hospital was certainly the most fun moment, but not my favourite.</p>
<p>Episode 2:<br>
Freeman Pontifex, without a doubt. I loved the sinister, decrepit feel to the whole level, but it was also clever how it twisted and looped around to make use of a single loading screen. Very good level, and one where the graphics looked most impressive.</p>
<p>White Forest Silo mission. After spending so long outdoors (where, in my opinion, the Half-Life games don’t lend themselves quite so well to), it was refreshing to be able to fight indoors in environments that are made for firefights. My only wishes were that it were longer and that the AI was better. The Combine soldiers always seem so keen to run foward rather than stay where they were or flank you.</p>
