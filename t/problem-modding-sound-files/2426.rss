    <title>Problem modding sound files</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-modding-sound-files/2426</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to modify some of the EP2 songs (which something I&#39;ve done succesfully in the past). Now the problem is that, when the music is supposed to play (for example, the last stand on the mine shaft) I just get nothing. Not even the default music comes up. Also, when I first modded the ep2 music, I got it right, and did the same thing now, except now it simply doesn&#39;t work.

So I ask you, what could&#39;ve gone wrong?

Note: I already checked and double checked the files names and their mp3 information. I obviously changed that as well to match the original music files info.

EDIT: Nevermind, I finally corrected the issue. I had to re-compress the sound files so they got a 44000khz frequency, otherwise HL2 wouldn&#39;t accept them.</description>

            <p>I’m not a genius with this subject, however it sounds like you saved it in the wrong mp3 format. I would try to re-save it with default settings.</p>

IDK if this could help you but give it a read.</p>
<p>EDIT: Never mind it sounds like you figured it out.</p>

            <p>Right-click the file &gt; Properties &gt; Set “Read-Only”. Retry.</p>
<p>Double check the file name and the folder structure. At least for Original Half-life the game kept overwriting the music file.</p>

            <p>Maybe someone can help me too, i tried to change the Nihalinth battle theme for something else, and it reverts back to the normal track. I changed the name to match the original file and it keeps on being replaces when i play the level.</p>
