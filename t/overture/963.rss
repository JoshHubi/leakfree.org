    <description>Overture - my one-man Portal project - has finally reached its second release.  This mappack will eventually feature 5-7 maps, a custom storyline, and I hope some custom textures and voice acting.

[url=https://forums.thinkingwithportals.com/post23760.html#23760]Here[/url] is the thread (with download link) on ThinkingWithPortals.

And here are some screens (which I hope work... this forum doesn&#39;t seem to like imageshack):

            <p>So I downloaded it. And enjoyed it. Really liked the last couple of puzzles.</p>
<p>Didn’t find any bugs though (I know you’re disappointed =P).</p>

            <p>Alright, that blocked portal is the same one Wasabi encountered… I’ll fix it soon.  I can’t believe that happened… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Alright, so the update is up… same thread that’s linked in the OP.  It fixes that bug and a few other ones that I found.</p>

            <p>^Which stairs, the ones that descend into the pit, or the ones at the beginning of the level?  I’ll take a look at them.  And which portal, when?</p>

<p>In the area with the platform that goes through the material emancipation grill the cube got stuck in the vital apparatus tube and just floated there, forcing me to noclip to it and grab it which started it moving. I then became stuck in the area behind the railings. The orange portal nearly killed me as I came through it and then would not let me or the cube out, as though there was a clip brush in front of it or something.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve never seen the cube get stuck there before… did it do that repeatedly?  As for the part behind the railing, please tell me how you tried to go about solving it, because I’ve gotten that complaint from another player as well, which leads me to think that people might be solving it in a way I hadn’t anticipated.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m still not seeing nodraws on the stairs; would you mind taking a screenshot?  I’m also still able to enter those portals without any trouble.</p>
<p>I’m also still not seeing the cube getting stuck in the vent.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">But…</span> I do know why you’re having the issue with the orange portal and getting stuck in the railing area.  I presume that you (highlight it) [color=white]stood on the unstationary scaffold and dropped the cube on the orange-toggle button from above?  If so, that’s one of two solutions that I had anticipated; however, it wasn’t the one that I had originally intended when I designed the puzzle.  It also looks like I didn’t take the proper measures to make it a fully workable solution… my bad.  I’ll try to fix it (along with a few other things I noticed) and reupload within the next week.  (I’ve got a final tomorrow and then am flying home, so I don’t know how much time I’ll have to work on it.)</p>

            <p>Your level seems to be rather… Unstable. In the area with the platform that goes through the material emancipation grill the cube got stuck in the vital apparatus tube and just floated there, forcing me to noclip to it and grab it which started it moving. I then became stuck in the area behind the railings. The orange portal nearly killed me as I came through it and then would not let me or the cube out, as though there was a clip brush in front of it or something.</p>

            <p>Ooooooh, about freakin’ time! (just joking, please don’t kill me…)</p>
<p>Those screenshots look amazing! I’m definitively going to download this. Like, right now. I’ll let you know my opinion once I spend over six hours trying to finish the first map, as it always happens… Damn, I’m slow  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I hope you can figure out the voice acting issue. I would help, but then again, weird accents get in the way. Now, off to the download link!</p>
