    <description>Medal of Honor - Bought the standard edition for full price thinking it would get me BF3 beta access, turns out it didn&#39;t and I ended up with a mediocre game.

Black Ops and MW3 - Bought both on impulse and while I don&#39;t actually hate either of them, I do regret paying 60 bucks for each.

Mafia 2 - Good game but was still a disappointment.

Saints Row 3 - Great game but bought it on impulse, played for an hour and haven&#39;t got back to it yet.

Dead Island - Almost the same case as SR3 but I did sink quite a few more hours into it.

RAGE - Way too short for the size (Yes, I know why is it so big) and did nothing to innovate both the FPS and open world genres.

SiN Episodes - While I loved the game, I bought it on the assumption that a steady stream of new episodes would be made after the first one but, unfortunately, Ritual wasn&#39;t able to continue the project and eventually faded into nothing.

Borderlands - I&#39;ve got mixed feelings about this one. While I love the freedom it offers and I think the gunplay is fun, I got bored of it very easily because the gameplay is very repetitive and the world is not diverse enough. Doesn&#39;t help that I also bought the GOTY edition because of the Duke Nukem Forever First Access thing. Oh boy...

From Dust - Should I even explain why?

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light - Very fun game but I couldn&#39;t be arsed to keep playing it after the first couple of levels.</description>

            <p>Maxey, it’s one of those things that’s a bit hard to put my finger on.  I didn’t like them, but I can’t fully explain why.  Some of the problems I noticed with the second one, yeah, it looked great and was quite colorful, but it seems like each “level” has a palette of only a few colors.  The city was all brown, yellow, and red.  The jungle was all green, grey, and blue.  The only parts that I felt broke this rule were the train wreck and the village in Tibet.  I’d have to play it again to see if there are any other standout areas, but I’m not going to.</p>
<p>I also didn’t particularly like the gameplay.  Jack of all trades, master of none.  The gunplay could have been a bit better, but I guess the climbing mechanics were solid enough.</p>
<p>The story also failed to suck me in.  It was okay, but for me, wasn’t much incentive to keep playing.</p>
<p>There’s more to it that I can’t really explain, as I said above.</p>

<p>They could have done something with Drake’s Deception- they hinted that Drake isn’t even his real name. Did they go anywhere with it? No. We went to a cruise ship that capsizes for no reason other than they made a dynamic water system and wanted to show it off. Uncharted needs to start thinking character instead of just set pieces. I like the gameplay for the most part but I just wish the story was up to snuff more. Uncharted 2 did a reasonable job of making everyone feel vulnerable, like there was a ton at stake. And it had that train level. A train level that took the entire development cycle of the game to make work. And oh BOY did it work.</p>

            <p>I played the second, and beat it.  I then played, and didn’t finish, the first, and just recently played, and didn’t finish the third.</p>
<p>So I didn’t play Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune first.  I took the time to beat Uncharted 2, even though I disliked a great deal of it, but got fed up with the other two.</p>

<p>Well as far as the Uncharted games go, don’t you have to enjoy the first one to even begin to enjoy the next two? Basically, if you loved the first one, you’re going to love its predecessors simply because they were made by improving upon the concepts of the original. Likewise, if you really can’t stand the first one at all, then I don’t think the latter one’s aren’t going to convert you as they don’t depart from the core concept.</p>

<p>Figured it would be a decent enough game and innovative enough to change my mind.</p>
<p>Nope. Still the same “run here, get me this, kill these for me, I’ll give you one of these”. Not too much to get excited over. No real reward for doing anything.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t regret paying full price for it, but looking back at my 300+ hour addiction, I now realize that it wasn’t the story or gameplay enjoyment or whatever that kept me coming back, it was mostly just the need for leveling up, getting better perks, weapons, armor and spells, and the occasional suddenly-an-epic-view! :awesome:</p>
<p>after skyrim, I went back and replayed Mass Effect and was surprised at just how much more I enjoyed every minute of it compared to skyrim.  better story and better characters make a better game IMO</p>

            <p>Uncharted 2 was my favorite of the series. The first game (Drake’s Fortune) had less solid climbing mechanics, stupid vehicle segments, and the AI wasn’t very good. Of course, it was good for narrative context for Uncharted 2.</p>
<p>Uncharted 3 was fun, but it wasn’t as fun as Uncharted 2. The game’s plot was much more obviously cobbled together around it’s set pieces, such as the capsizing boat sequence that had little or no relation to the rest of the game and was purely included because one of the developers had spent a bunch of time on a dynamic water system for the level. That said, there were some really great moments (such as the foot chase through the city that captured the feel of the Tangiers chase in "The Bourne Ultimatum), but all in all nothing could save the game from the Michael Bay trap of writing the plot around action setpieces.</p>
<p>Compare the above sequences to the train levels in Uncharted 2- that was a fantastically designed level that used every car of the train to it’s fullest, conveyed a perfect sense of danger, and constantly surprised the player with the crazy things that happened. Or that sequence in Tibet with the ice climbing. Or even the museum infiltration level near the beginning. Ultimately it’s proof positive that fantastic technical ability is unimportant when compared to narrative gravitas and good game design.</p>
<p>What I definitely want to see is how “The Last of Us” turns out- if they get a great story going in that one, the game could really push the envelope.</p>

            <p>From Dust- It was alright, but not what I had in mind when I bought it.</p>
<p>Uncharted 2- My dad told me he would go halves with me (so technically I got it 50% off) however I did not like it at all and stopped playing after an hour or so.</p>
<p>L.A. Noire - Its a fun game, but gets stressful and I have to stop playing it after a short period of time.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 13- The combat seemed too cheap compared to what the game can be and also compared to other recent FF games.</p>

            <p>Soul Calibur 5. its alright, but 4 was way better. story mode sucks, no cinematics at all, just pics with sound. black and… parchment color pics. the only redeeming factor imo is that it got Ezio from assassins creed 2… im thinking about selling it.</p>

            <p>Yeah I forgot about Red Alert 3. Such a damn let down. Red Alert has always been abit of a cheese, but imo it went way over the top. The gameplay didn’t really go anywhere interesting and the new additions just felt half assed and completely out of place.</p>

            <p>Aliens versus Predator: 50 euros IIRC. * crying*<br>
Man, I love the setting, but man did the game suck. Unfortunately I’m no Source modder, otherwise I would have started an AvP Source mod.</p>
<p>Red Alert 3 - Premier Edition: 60 euros. Didn’t like building on water. But mods (especially The Red Alert) changed it for the better returning to the old school Red Alert setting.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Empire Total War, Napoleon Total War and Shogun 2 Total War: they all look pretty nice, but really beneath those visuals there’s little options concerning diplomacy and it’s always you versus the rest. Dumbass games…</p>

            <p>Saints Row 3: The novelty quickly wore off tbh, and overall it just wasn’t as improved over sr2 as I’d liked/thought from the trailers, whilst also removing stuff I did.</p>
<p>MW3: Whilst the single player started well it quickly trailed off into macho BS. Spec Ops was interesting but certainly nothing new. Survival mode kinda sucked imo for what it could of been. Multiplayer is just garbage all around. Although I did buy it second hand, I still shouldn’t of paid that for it. MW 2.5 is the most spot on description I’ve ever heard.</p>
<p>Gears of War 3: Bought it because the beta was just awesome. However they decided to rehaul the damage for the main game ( cunts trick ) and I found the multiplayer to become the same old gears shotgun fest. I have all the gears, yet they are the games I least play. I haven’t touched 3 in months. Now it’s like £15.</p>
<p>I didn’t pay full for Rage as some people did. Infact I got it for the equivilant of around under 20 dollars. In that case it was money well spent as I found it to be a very rich/detailed and interesting world, with some of the most solid albeit nothing new shooting mechanics this gen. I loved the A.I too, and the multiplayer was a fun surprise as I thought it would be shoddy.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t of wanted to pay full price though. The ending did leave alot to be desired  and it was far too short, even with all the additions. If they had lengthened out the second half and had a more substantial ending I would of REALLY enjoyed it.</p>
<p>My biggest disapointment by far though I did pay full price for was Brink. God damn that game had SO much potential. I hung on to that game for months after and it was still unplayable. I contemplated trading it in and getting over half my money back, then less than a week later I could only get less than a quarter. I did it anyway as I still couldn’t find enjoyment in it, when underneath the problems there clearly was some potentially awesome fun to be had. But unplayable games are unplayable games, and quite simply not worth the time (xbox360).</p>
<p>Everyone also hated Alpha Protocol, but I actually enjoyed that game despite the problems, and thus wouldn’t consider it a bad purchase.</p>

<p>$30 is full price these days?</p>

</aside>
<p>Full price implies the price of the game at release. If SWTOR was $30 at release, then yes, I would consider it full price. To be fair, I had initially presumed that it was $50 for the hard copy.</p>
