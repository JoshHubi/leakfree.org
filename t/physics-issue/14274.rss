    <description>Greetings. Can someone explain why when I jump in moving rail wagon i&#39;m stoping while the rail wagon keeps moving? This is just the begining of the game and it already breakes all laws of physics  :frowning:  This kills  all wish to play  :frowning:</description>

<p>Probably not. Source uses licensed Havok physics, which I don’t think we have code access to. Even if we did, that stuff is extremely complicated anyway (hence why it’s licensed from a professional company who specifically deals with game physics), so I doubt we’d be able to do a better job. And regardless, it is a fairly minor issue, it only crops up 2 or 3 times throughout the course of the game.</p>

<p>Well. you right of course, i just thought that engines like Source can program speed of a player inside an object like “player speed + speed of object relative to outside world”  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  Sorry for my bad English and thanks for explanations  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Is there any chance it will be fixed or it’s imposible on current engine?</p>
