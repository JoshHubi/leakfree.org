    <title>AVP 2 Mouse Axis Y slower than X</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/avp-2-mouse-axis-y-slower-than-x/12209</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m a little at my wit&#39;s end here with this. I have to slow the framerate down, (using Vsyc atm) otherwise the NPCs all move around too fast, and the Dialogue cuts out. A nastly side effect of this however, is that the Mouse Y axis (up and down) has a much lower sensitivity than the mouse X axis (left and right), which causes looking up and down quickly very difficult as my view is swinging ridiculously from side to side. Anyone have any idea how to fix this?</description>

            <p>Well, isn’t it the case that you can only use DX11 if the game supports it?</p>

            <p>Yeah, I did, it’s still the same issue.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Now, I didn’t install the DX8 when I was prompted, because I figured I have DX11, there is no need, would installing DX8 possibly help, or would it be pointless?</p>

            <p>Have you tried it with another mouse, just to be sure that it’s not an oddly specific hardware problem?</p>

            <p>Thanks a ton Blood! I didn’t know how to do that, and it should have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m a giant moron and apparently misdiagnosed the problem.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  What actually happens (apparently) is the mouse randomly jerks from side to side when moving on the y (up and down) axis. It felt like a sensitivity issue because when ever I moved the mouse up and down, the screen moved horizontally giving the illusion that the X axis was way stronger than Y.</p>
<p>So… Square one.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  Any other ideas? Blood would have fixed the problem with the erroneous information I gave him.</p>

            <p>Do you have a gaming mouse? I had the same problem so I used a mouse profile to make the Y-axis faster then the X that would only apply when AvP 2 was launched.</p>
<p>That, and there’s also the “Use OS native drivers for pointer speed”</p>
<p>But that’s if you even have a mouse like that though…</p>
