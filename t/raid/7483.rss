    <description>Is it THAT dangerous to run RAID 0? Is the performance worth anything, or should I go with RAID 1?

EDIT: Probably should have been in help and support but whatever...</description>

<p>That’s what I needed to hear, thanks.</p>
<p>I have a 3rd laying around, might look into RAID 5 too.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t suggest you get a SSD contrary to what everyone thinks. Although booting fast is neat and all I wouldn’t consider it worth it.  The price point and extremely limited re-write compared to normal HDs makes it not a very good product at this point.</p>

            <p>If you have 3 hard drives, you could do RAID5, which is RAID0 + a redundant drive (you should get RAID0 performance with RAID1 storage capacity of the same two drives).  Otherwise, my vote would be a 120GB+ SSD because DAMN they are fast  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .  From POST to Windows 7 desktop = 10 seconds, and that includes the 2 it takes me to enter my password.</p>

            <p>Wanting to put off getting an SSD since I had 3 big HDDs laying around.</p>
<p>Getting around to this may take a while, because I can’t be arsed to backup all my data this week. :V</p>
<p>Anyway, I was considering 1 instead of 0 because I want to make use of these HDDs, but I might just sell the 2 extra ones and pick up an SSD.</p>

            <p>I have no firsthand experience with RAID 0, but if all you’re concerned with is performance, why would you consider 1 as a backup? It only provides data redundancy.</p>
<p>If you really want to boost your computer’s loading speeds though, get an SSD. They’re expensive, but if you have the cash you will really see improvements. My friend and I tested his computer once - from cold boot, including Windows and <a href="http://Battle.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Battle.net</a> logins, he could be in Starcraft II in 30 seconds. Kind of imprecise, but real-world tests tell a lot more I think.</p>
