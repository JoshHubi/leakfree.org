    <title>GoldSrc Game Configurations</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/goldsrc-game-configurations/549</link>
    <description>Hi, im wondering how I can make GoldSrc engine maps. A few weeks ago my computer got clogged with crap, so my freind kindly came over and fixed it. When I went to load up hammer it said something about game configurations being lost, and that I would have to select them again. I just said okay and loaded it up. However, at one point it had an option of which engine the maps you made would run on. I noticed in the list, that it said GoldSrc but I thought nothing of it and just clicked the Source Engine configuration. But a few weeks later I though of the GoldSrc engine option and thought about it. I eventually went to see if I could reconfigure the maps to run on GoldSrc engine, but nothing worked. Can someone please tell me if there is any way to reset my game configurations?  :[

ALSO: Please note that I have tried selecting the Reset Game configurations option in the load up menu but that did nothing, so please dont tell me to do that.</description>
