    <description>It was discovered today that Apple removed there jailbreak API detection feature in iOS 4.2!!! Posing the question &quot;Did apple finally give up?&quot; &quot;DID WE WIN THE CAT AND MOUSE GAME!?!?!?!?!?!?!?&quot;

            <p>I seriously doubt this is Apple giving up. They most likely found a different, “better” way of protecting against jailbreakers (clearly the special API dedicated to it didn’t stop the jailbreaking scene), although I’m sure that people like the Devteam members will find a way around whatever Apple is planning on implementing as well.</p>

            <p>He’s right. I know lost of people who JB there ipods, just so they can change the wallpapers, remove regenial volume limits, tweakers rather than piraters.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes but this analogy fails when you realise that 99% of jailbreakers don’t pirate. I know a ton of people who jailbreak and not one of them pirates apps. I know it’s anecdotal evidence but I don’t think jailbreaking is anywhere near as bad for pirating as torrenting.</p>
<p>Just look at the App Store, it’s absolutely BOOMING!</p>

<p>Doesn’t help me much, I have a bricked iphone 3GS that fails restore from iTunes and never goes past the lockdownd screen, so i’m waiting for either a tool that can flash a firmware without using itunes or until the 3gs android port is complete (maybe never)</p>
<p>I also have two ipod touch 2g’s that are both bricked and don’t restore in iTunes for some reason… Gotta love apple and their shitty software update system that bricks your device permanently even without attempting a jailbreak.</p>

</aside>
<p>From what i remember, the 3GS you have has its IMEI blocked anyway dosn’t it? Even if you flashed the firmware, the phone wouldn’t work as a phone anyway.</p>

<p>Right, but it often leads to piracy.  I do like having open devices, like my CFW PSP, but it could kill sales.  Of course, the masses will still buy everything from iTunes.</p>
<p>I do not support piracy, but I do like to be able to play stuff I’ve paid for with better loading times (I have ripped a few of my PSP games and put them on my memstick) and the ability to use homebrew.</p>

            <p>Apple would never simply give up fighting piracy. They’re probably just implementing an entirely new form of anti-piracy. Or perhaps they are luring you into a false sense of security and once everyone has jailbroken their ipod they’ll release an update catching the jailbreak and do something to your ipod.</p>

            <p>Lol! 2 possible outcomes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Apple realised that they cannot win against the hive-mind collective like the internet, and decided to forget it. (possible but unlikely since Jobs is a narcisistic asshole)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are planting tracking devices in their products and the drivers for which will be included in the new OS so they can track and sew people at their leasure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
