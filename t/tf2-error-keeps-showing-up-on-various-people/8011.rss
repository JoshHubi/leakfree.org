    <title>TF2 - Error keeps showing up on various people</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tf2-error-keeps-showing-up-on-various-people/8011</link>
    <description>Whenever playing a game in TF2, I encounter this error: [url]https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/631854688433193612/0BC0FBD3025581430F7477A475F63BCB8CC6696F/[/url]

Now I notice that it only occurs when some things are worn, like various hats and medals. This piece of shit error happened after one of the recent patches.

Any help?

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I already verified my game twice already</description>

            <p>I appreciate the reply, but I just figured out that it’s because of a No Hat mod I installed a long time ago. After deleting it, it fixed itself. Thanks mate</p>

            <p>That error is caused by a missing model.  Since it only happens when the character is wearing hat or medal, this means that your TF2 doesn’t have the models for hats or medals.  Since you’ve already verified, I would try reinstalling.  I doubt there’s much else you could do without obtaining the models from somewhere else and sticking them in your models directory.</p>
