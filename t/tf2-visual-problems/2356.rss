    <description>Yes, I realize I have a lot of problems  :stuck_out_tongue:  .

So I decided to fire up TF2 today after not playing it for awhile. There are a lot of problems with the way the game looks. One of the levels I was playing on had a lot of wire frame looking stuff and those purple and black squares. The sky was also flickering. The character customization screen has that same wire frame look and most of the pictures for the achievements are a square with a diagonal line through it. That&#39;s how most of the level screenshots are too when looking for a server to play on. 

I realize that it&#39;s because I&#39;m missing files somewhere but I don&#39;t know exactly which files. And I would prefer not to entirely redownload it. The game plays perfectly fine and I managed to play point capture on Dust Bowl for an hour.</description>

            <p>Sorry, last post in here.</p>
<p>Okay, I redownloaded the files and verified the game files. It worked so I was able to play normally. I also checked on the graphics card driver and it was out of date so I updated it.</p>

            <p>Okay, I redownloaded the game and will move the files over in a little bit. If that doesn’t work then I’ll try your thing DrFate.</p>
