    <description>[u]*WARNING, MY MAIN LANGUAGE ISN&#39;T ENGLISH (CAN BE MISTAKES)*[/size][/u]

[b]Dear Crowbar Collective.[/b][/size]

From the all Russian Black Mesa Community members, I speak to you about all the known problems in the game – Russian Localization. I will not talk about others languages, because I don’t know how are they. Since May 2015, all the Russian-speaking community is waiting for the update, which will be introduced to the game Russian language. And October 31, 2016. We kind of got what we wanted. If not the quality of the localization.[/size]



* 1.	Many well-known problem that immediately notice the player an eye, it is a problem with fonts.[/size]
* 2.	The quality of the translation. Frankly - [b]it&#39;s bad![/b] Starting from grammatical mistakes, prints, mistranslation, which does not reflect the essence of what was said. Pumping the lack of translation in many places.[/size]


[/size]

These problems are set to reflect on your relationship to the RU community. waiting for more than a year, we got a bad translation. So even after the update has been more than 3 months, and you have not corrected these problems.


We would have to understand that it is difficult, you need a lot of time and etc. If from the moment when modification was out in 2012, didn’t exist [b]AMATEUR RUSSIAN LOCALIZATION.[/b] That supports to our days. Includes:


1.	Full quality translation of subtitles with the preservation of all meaning.
2.	Russian voiceover!
3.	Translation textures!
4.	Adaptation of the font on the main menu and it’s a full translation[/size]
[/size]
[/size]
Even after Hallowe&#39;en update our compatriots have corrected all of your translation mistakes. I can say that all the job was done for you, but we still don’t see it in the game. Why?![/size]


You see, Black Mesa is no longer a free modification made by fans, it’s a paid game on steam. Accordingly, the attitude to it as to a quality remake. When the player is not familiar with the game before comes in and sees these problems, what is his reaction? Dissatisfied increasingly, because the problem has not been solved.


You do not take labor to add 1 and 4 point in the game of the already existing localization. I know about your love to produce only a major updates with all the bug fixes, but I think here it is possible to make an exception.[/size]
