    <title>Pointless invisible wall in bm_c1a2a</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pointless-invisible-wall-in-bm-c1a2a/14276</link>
    <description>There&#39;s a spot in bm_c1a2a where an invisible wall prevents me from shooting a houndeye (see screenshot; includes position data). If I&#39;m not supposed to kill it at that time, I&#39;d suggest another solution because placing an obvious and confusing invisible wall at such a spot is always the worst solution (IMO). Making the houndeye appear there after reaching a certain area on the map might be a solution.

            <p>This houndeye at that point in the level is meant as a bit of a gag (as it’s sitting there watching the TV). You do actually end up being able to kill it a bit later once you get to that next area.</p>
<p>Though I agree, there’s no real reason to not let you kill it there, other than the devs not wanting the player to be a heartless dick with interrupting its favorite show.</p>
