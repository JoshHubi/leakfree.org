    <title>Need help installing On a Rail Uncut and Surface Tension Uncut.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-help-installing-on-a-rail-uncut-and-surface-tension-uncut/14325</link>
    <description>Ok,


So I have been a fan of the OaRU and STU and have installed them both and played them before. However, I cannot successfully install either of them now. The case in...

...[i]Surface Tension[/i] is that I use the installer, I read the readme, make sure the path is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS (that&#39;s correct). I play through surface tension, and every time, that spot where I should enter the parking garage, there is always the same fucking vent that the snarks come out of.

...[i]On a Rail[/i] is that I extract the files with WinRar to the path (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS) and boot up the start of On a Rail. I bring the tram to the top of the elevator, and go around the corner, and instead of merging left onto a looping path like in the mod I am brought to a straightaway.

I have reinstalled Black Mesa several times, redownloaded the mod, installed and played with an existing save, to no avail.
All I want to do is just play some mods, help would be appreciated.  :cursing:</description>

<p>This only works with the free mod version of Black Mesa. There will be a Steam Workshop version of it for the Steam version of Black Mesa when the Steam Workshop limitation is removed.</p>

<p>As I read your post this immediately caught my eye. Typically when installing map addons you <span class="bbcode-u">should not</span> use existing saves. Only use new saves from after installation.</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t think that much is your actual problem. My guess is that you did not allow the stock files to be overwritten by the uncut files. Although I can’t exactly speak for STU since I would think the installer would take care of that for you. But with Uncut? Yeah, definitely make sure you do that.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is to reinstall the mods and then go into your BMS/maps folder and confirm that the modded files are there.</p>
