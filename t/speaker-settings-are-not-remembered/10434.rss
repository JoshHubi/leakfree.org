    <title>Speaker settings are not remembered</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/speaker-settings-are-not-remembered/10434</link>
    <description>Thought I&#39;d throw this bug out there.

I like to play with headphones, so I set the speaker settings under the Audio tab to &quot;Headphones&quot;. However, every time I start the game, it sets itself back to &quot;2 Speakers&quot;, so I have to change it every time I launch the game.</description>

            <p>This is the case with Half Life 2 as well.</p>
<p>I noticed this with the roll effect option.  It is always reset to 3.5 whenever I start the game.</p>
