Looks like Microsoft is finally shaping up and willing to follow the W3C schools this time around.

Now if only people were willing to upgrade from IE6 to something new, then my nightmares as a webdesigner are finally over.



*PS* With IE embracing HTML5 Video as well, Adobe could be in serious pain as far as Flash for webcontent goes.</description>

            <p>Peh, just another tool for them to scan your damn computor and your privacy. Microsoft fails at 99%. 1% is there only success The “Windows XP,” and yes, I do use Firefox because it never failed me once. Like Microsoft Explorer did when ever I went to a site or dl something.</p>

            <p>I’m always using my add-ons, last time I used chrome was when it was in alpha stage, I lost interest shortly after I realized, google wants the user to switch from anything they’re using to an alternative made by google, that’s why I don’t have a gmail and I still use firefox.</p>

            <p>Except for firefox’s add-ons, nothing can compare to google chrome. Use firefox when you want to use an add-on then use google chrome for absolutely everything else.</p>

            <p>I’m glad they’re finally taking things seriously, and this is no doubt great for the web as a whole, but my relationship with IE ended with version 6.  I haven’t even updated it to version 7 or later because it’s not even worth it for a browser I never open (except to test websites, on the rarest of occasions).  I’m Firefox all the way now, just for the addons… they hooked me. :[ User Agent Switcher, Web Developer, Image Zoom, UnMHT, Adblock, Request Policy, Multiproxy Switch, RefControl, Regular Expression search from the search bar… the list goes on…  I just wish they would dump Gecko and get on the WebKit bandwagon. Shoot, even Steam is getting it. :’(</p>
<p>As far as Google Chrome goes, it may have <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> addons, but it can’t even begin to compete with Firefox’s extensive list.  Maybe someday, but not just yet.  (Also, if anyone’s thinking of bashing Chrome simply because it’s from Google, you may want to <a href="https://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">look here first</a> — bottom line is, it’s really is a decent browser, don’t bash it until you’ve tried it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )</p>

<p>Microsoft may get “this”, but they don’t get it all. Did you know that the Windows Phone Series 7 will have no cut and paste or multitasking? As Microsoft said:</p>

<p>The issue is that it’s not going to convince any of the companies that still use IE6, mostly because the IT department don’t want to have to deal with all the idiots who deny change or they have stuff that only works on IE6.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s nice and fast (I have been using Chrome since December), but the addons are kind of limited in their functionality. Like the ad-blocking ones don’t actually block the ad from loading, it just hides them from view, while in Firefox they are literally blocked from even loading.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s really worth keeping in mind the technical benefits of the more limited extension design, though. The interface is VERY consistent (you don’t get extensions polluting context menus, or the odd extension that wants to be in the status bar for no reason), and with that consistency we get goodies like badges to indicate the number of new items.<br>
Extensions can be installed / enabled / disabled / individually killed (and checked for resource consumption) instantly without restarting the browser, and they have far less capacity to screw things up.</p>
<p>Besides, who needs ad blocking when the performance hit is practically invisible?</p>

            <p>It’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>But to answer your statement: I think most people on here don’t really care what Microsoft’s up to with the internet, since most people on here don’t use IE anyway. So it doesn’t really affect a lot of people here.</p>

            <p>Webkit FTW.  Safari on my Mac, Chrome on my PC.  Haven’t needed IE (except for a few IE-only internal corporate websites) in ages.</p>

            <p>Not really a huge deal since it’s not widely used yet, but IE still doesn’t support apng.<br>

The little ball on that page is animated, for those running running browsers that don’t support it.</p>

            <p>Opera is decently fast, and low impact but lacks customization in it’s layout, which isn’t good for me, because I really hate it’s design.<br>
I’ve tried out IE9 in it’s limited form, and it still doesn’t abide by web standards enough.<br>
Fails Acid3 still…l I hope it does better.<br>
I’m a firefox/chrome user. I have a lot of use for certain Firefox apps, and I have a real love for the ability to maneuver the layout of the interface.<br>
chrome is fast and lightweight and simple. It doesn’t customize as well, but I like the design more than Opera.</p>
