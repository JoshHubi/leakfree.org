            <p>You guys weren’t using those hotswap bays for hard drives were you? If not, good! They’re known to have heating issues average temp in those are over 50C. too long usage and the next time you turn it on, dzzittt! short circuit in the board and the disk. That happened to my brother and I. my solution was to put a 120mm fan on top of the case, now it’s average 28C. And my brother took his out entirely and now his new HDD works at around 33C.</p>

<p>I doubt that this hard drive could be recovered that way. That’s probably the first thing they tried.</p>

<p>actually, from what I hear replacing everything with 0kb files can be recovered from, if you have really good, really expensive recovery software, the problem is when you have randomized junk files.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When files are removed from a hard drive, they aren’t actually removed, just the reference to them is removed, and the hard drive says it’s free space that can be written over. So, those recovery programs are just looking through the hard drive for files that haven’t been overwritten by something else yet, and then restoring that reference to them.</p>
