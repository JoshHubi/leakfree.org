            <p>The “innovation” they speak of is one that has already been available in WoW (and probably others as well) for a little under 2 years now. Having your actions and quests effect the world permanently really isn’t available.</p>
<p>But of course, they’re talking an a broader sense… Which is not feasible in an MMO. Great, you’re doing a quest to save a caravan from a raid of centaur… And now that caravan is saved and you’ll never see it attacked again… But wait a minute, this is supposed to be an MMO… You’re supposed to meet players… But how do you meet them if they’re doing stuff that you’ve already done?</p>
<p>They’re selling the “innovation” part nicely with smooth talk, but don’t expect that much innovation. I have a feeling it’ll be a near exact copy of how WoW handles story progression with phasing technology.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the video didn’t really show anything that’s unique.</p>

            <p>Ahaha I remember when Activision said that MW2 was going to be the best online fps experience or something like that (can’t remember very well). Well you can go to see that it got high scores, but then look for the players/community rating. I’ve seen many guys on IGN saying 1.0/10 and 0.0/10.</p>
<p>TF2 is much older game and it’s still my favourite Online FPS ever and HL2 being my best offline FPS ever.</p>
<p>Developers don’t go for innovation, it’s just hire some modellers/artists/programs throw all that was ever done before and put it on a different place and then put a their “new game” selling for this price.<br>
Don’t know if you care much about MMO’s but recently ArenaNet released a Manifesto Trailer where the word " innovation" is the key for the game. They want to innovate the MMO genre as HL did with the FPS genre. And it’ll be F2P (<a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/media/videos/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Video</a>)</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, because getting getting exploded, falling down a waterfall, getting stabbed in the chest, THEN PULLING THE KNIFE OUT, and still having the ability to throw it at someone’s head - whilst not bleeding out yourself - is very realistic.</p>
<p>EDIT: That car has been seen so many places before, I remember something similar being in Ratchet and Clank.</p>

            <p>I guess that’s my issue with the gaming industry these days. Very few publisher (or developers for that matter) are pursuing innovative games. Look at whats been coming out:<br>
7 Halo games, 6 CoD games, 16 Final Fantasy games, and every other game with a number on it. Zero innovation with a well known name will still sell. Thank god Valve isn’t a piece of shit like every other developer out there.</p>
