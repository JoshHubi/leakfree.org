    <title>Changes from WON to Steam: Half-Life 1</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/changes-from-won-to-steam-half-life-1/8924</link>
    <description>I was taking  a look at an old WON version of Half-Life the other day and I noticed some things between the two.  I&#39;ll list them out just to simplify things:

1.) The camera tilts when you strafe left and right.  Just as in Quake.
2.) When you run forward, the weapon behaves differently.
3.) The UI is completely different.  The menu from 1998 was much cooler and more animated than the Steam version.

Why would Valve change the game when porting it to Steam?  Couldn&#39;t they just  remove the CD key from the original and put that on Steam?  What was the point of changing it?  And from what I&#39;ve seen, only version 1.0 had the camera tilt in it.  Why would they remove that?  If I remember correctly, that same tilt appeared in the early trailers for Half-Life 2 as well. :hmph:</description>

<p>Maybe. Sounds like it could work, although we would need to reprogram the game to only use one background map, and then make the brush, textures, etc. It would be better to just program the game to use a simple background picture that had the animated logo on it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But doesn’t the mapper define the camera points? So couldn’t he just make a small room outside of the map in each “Chapter” map and put the texture in front of it?</p>
<p>Or in the case of black mesa, it would be cool to have it so the first time you load it up it has the scrolling logo, then subsequent times after getting further it changes to reflect your current chapter</p>

            <p>One thing I remember about playing HL single player from the CD (unpatched) is that it used to dial up my ISP for no apparent reason.  Patches later fixed it.</p>

<p>Shit i just realized, HL2/source based games sometimes use actual levels as their backgrounds right? So couldn’t we make a level (HL: S or HL2, or even black mesa when its out) and use animated HL1 AVI logo (or make a new one) as a texture on a brush in front of the camera?</p>

            <p>I loved the old menu, especially the sounds the buttons made. The Steam menu is ugly and looks like a green, rounded version of Windows 95.</p>
<p>I think a large part of me liking it is also related to nostalgia though, and I don’t really care about menus that much.</p>
<p>If you think Steam’s menu is crap, check out Skyrim.</p>

<p>I don’t think you know the difference between something being “polished” &amp; something being “flashy”. The steam one is simple &amp; utilitarian, which I like.

            <p>Forget about the WON version taking longer to navigate. All I fucking want is that flashing logo and the awesome sounds when you close stuff. They could have easily kept that stuff without making the menu clunky.</p>
<p>If you think that stuff wasn’t cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGJzMp7b-MY" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">you’re a fucking moron</a></p>
<p>And honestly, you can make that pretty damn functional if you take that root menu and make it so when you click on the buttons there the steam windows pop up. Functionality problem solved, and stylishness returned. Oh, and it had a mod loader FROM THE MENU.</p>
<p>If Black Mesa had the flashing, scrolling logo in the main menu I would fucking burst</p>

<p>Also, in the steam version I’ve noticed a horrible glitch when hitting dead npcs with the crowbar. There seems to be no constraint on the rate at which they can be hit, and the gib nearly instantly. This doesn’t happen in 1.0 at least, and maybe all WON updates.</p>

<p>I liked the original  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">   The original wasn’t really obnoxious just a little more polished.  Neither takes long to load and neither are hard to navigate.  But the original is considered better by most people.</p>

<p>I am more annoyed that they dumped VGUI after the orange box and went with some kind of L4D/Portal 2 menu system which takes 3 times longer to navigate through (especially advanced 3D settings)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s most likely because Valve’s been expanding to the console market more in recent years.  I would be fine if they made they just made the options easier to navigate through.  Portal 2 especially.</p>

<p>Also, in the steam version I’ve noticed a horrible glitch when hitting dead npcs with the crowbar. There seems to be no constraint on the rate at which they can be hit, and the gib nearly instantly. This doesn’t happen in 1.0 at least, and maybe all WON updates.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think that was in all WON versions.  What I really hate was that stupid glitch when you gib a dead npc with the crowbar and the animation freezes and it goes into some kind of “hyper-gib” mode. :meh:</p>

<p>Also the old version only supported 4:3 aspect ratios and had other problems with newer gpus.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That really doesn’t have to do with the UI.  That’s within GoldSrc itself.  All it took was some simple source code fixing.  And HL doesn’t really look good on higher resolution monitors.  Some things get stretched out.  Like the menu backgrounds.</p>

<p>no, you cant. it used to be in the multyplayer option when selecting the player model. you cant do this, on the source version… can you do it on the older engine version that is just updated for steam?</p>

            <p>The only things that really bug me about the Steam version are A) The lack of head-tilt (I thought it was really cool actually, to be honest) entirely, and B) The movement freeze on level-change, it’s quite annoying.</p>
