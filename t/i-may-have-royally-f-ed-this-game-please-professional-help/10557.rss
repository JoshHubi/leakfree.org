    <description>my game wont work. last night i installed it into the bms thing, didnt work. so i installed it into my desktop (stupid i know) but when it was fnished installing it said &quot;run bms&quot; and i clicked it and played for hours straight. then i exited the game. then the next day after hours of trying to find the place where i can click to play it again, i found it on steam. but it kept on showing errors. so i deleted all the files (keeping the SAVE file in a different folder) i reinstalled the game, id everything right, then put the save file in the bms folder, clicked the thing on steam, and it didnt work. i took out the save file, didnt work. restarted steam, didnt work. ill write exactly what shows up when i click on it:
MountAppFilesystem() failed:
SteamMountAppFilesystem(218,0,0x1716f81c) failed with error1: No default filesystems for this App


i dont know what else to do, i still have the save  file stored iin a different folder, i have all the requirements. if i need to start the game over i guess ill have to do it but if theres a way please help</description>

<p>ok i did it, but now a different error shows up that says "this game is currently unavailable. please try again later’</p>

</aside>
<p>You did not exit Steam before deleting the file, didn’t you?<br>
Try exiting and starting it now.<br>
It should do an update cycle on starting up.<br>
Then try BMS.</p>
