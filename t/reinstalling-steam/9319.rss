    <title>Reinstalling Steam</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/reinstalling-steam/9319</link>
    <description>Bloody typical now that BM has a release date, my main hdd has gone wonky. (clunk of death and lockups)
Anyway, just set up another drive to boot from with a clean OS install and now to install Steam.
My question is, after installing Steam, is it possible to drag the games etc from the olde drive to the new one, without having to download all the games again, which would take forever?
Anyone tried this?
Cheers  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Yeah Steam is incredibly portable. You can literally delete everything except the main steam.exe and steamapps folder, move JUST the steam.exe and steamapps folder, and it will just automatically fix itself when you run it from the new location.</p>
<p>Then you can clean up the old location, and tada! Steam location moved. Zero hassle.</p>

            <p>the registry entries it makes are for mods and other installers to find out where Steam is located IIRC</p>

<p>Hey that’s great, thanks!<br>
Sounds like Steam is portable lol.<br>
Are there no registry entries?</p>

<p>There are, but they’re unnecessary. Either that or they set themselves if they don’t exist.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Yeah. I keep my whole steam folder on a separate drive to my OS, to avoid the small hassle.</p>

            <p>You don’t even need to reinstall steam, provided you’ve left the whole steam folder intact.<br>
Just run the executable, steam is cool like that.</p>

            <p>Yeah, this is very simple to do.<br>
Just copy the steamapps folder from your old installation into the new one.</p>
