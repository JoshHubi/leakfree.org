    <title>Video game banning and censorship</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/video-game-banning-and-censorship/2038</link>
    <description>So how far do you think this will go? What with the media milking the &quot;Gaems &#39;r&#39; bad&quot; cash cow, and the power being held by people who don&#39;t play games.

Recently [url]https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2009/12/04/Brazil-Bill-Outlaws-Offensive-Games.aspx[/url] Brazil may outlaw some video-games and making import of it a crime.

How far do you think they&#39;ll go to attempt to ruin one of our favorite pass-times? Personally I think that at one point someone is going to cross the line and the games industry will grow a spine.</description>

            <p>Games shouldn’t be banned or censored. If they do anything, they should just clean up the covers of the games so people incapable of handling viritual blood and gore don’t have to see it. It would be like banning Cannibal Corpse records. Oh wait… Anyway, sure, they can keep it off the non-owner of the games vision, but they can’t take away the fun of mutilating for the person who bought it.</p>

<p>It’s because the people behind AvP refused to alter the game, so they either had to ban it or let it go out with the violence.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is very true.<br>
See if game developers had refused to make changes to begin with and taken their lumps for a while, they could stand a chance against the censorship demands of various countries (Maybe not all but certainly some).</p>
<p>But since they typically cave in and made changes which cost time and money to expand their market slightly, it tells the governments that they will play ball and accept censorship and the costs of making the needed changes for that small market portion. Good luck getting any significant change to game censorship in the next 50 years.</p>
<p>This whole thing carries some parallels to the movie industry in the 1950s and 60s. But It was simple enough to just take all the copies of a film coming into your country (at most a few hundred probably) and snip out <em>bad</em> footage and glue it back together.</p>
<p>But it is a much different story to take a companies game reverse engineer it make their changes, troubelshoot the resulting product, recompile and press 10,000-100,000 copies and pass the payment on to the maker.</p>

<p>hahaha, oh Acristoff, if you only could know what is really happening here, you would think that is the minor of the problems…</p>
<p>By the way, do you know why CS was banned here?<br>
There was a map called as_rio (or something very close to that), which was based on rescue the hostages on a shantytown. The judge said that (and see, only because of this map - fan made) that CS teaches guerrilla tatics to people (specially sellers). Everquest was banned too.</p>

<p>So how far do you think this will go? What with the media milking the “Gaems ‘r’ bad” cash cow, and the power being held by people who don’t play games.</p>
<p>Recently <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2009/12/04/Brazil-Bill-Outlaws-Offensive-Games.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2009/12/04/Brazil-Bill-Outlaws-Offensive-Games.aspx</a> Brazil may outlaw some video-games and making import of it a crime.</p>
<p>How far do you think they’ll go to attempt to ruin one of our favorite pass-times? Personally I think that at one point someone is going to cross the line and the games industry will grow a spine.</p>

<p>hahaha, oh Acristoff, if you only could know what is really happening here, you would think that is the minor of the problems…</p>
<p>By the way, do you know why CS was banned here?<br>
There was a map called as_rio (or something very close to that), which was based on rescue the hostages on a shantytown. The judge said that (and see, only because of this map - fan made) that CS teaches guerrilla tatics to people (specially sellers). Everquest was banned too.</p>

<p>Well it seems that L4D has to censor it’s material but this is allowed?<br>

<p>Well we now have a version of L4D2 which has all the gore, violence, guns, zombies, characters, lighting, scenery, walkmeshes, menus, loading screens and fun removed.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well I don’t mind people voicing an opinion per ce, I just mind it when the elected officials in government who are elected to represent the views of the majority refuse to listen to that majority when it comes to issues such as this.</p>
<p>The point of discussions like this is to get change happening in places like Australia (where I have the misfortune - at least as far as video games go - of living), where conservative, confused and downright <span class="bbcode-i">wrong</span> people enact ridiculous, time consuming and pointless decisions like renaming the drug “Morphine” to “Med X” in Fallout 3. Supposedly it detracts from the realism of the game, but is that what we want? Its like saying “nice book Agatha Christie, but how about we replace the main character with a small rooster to make it more suitable”. It destroys the artistic integrity of the game and makes it utterly unenjoyable, vis a vis L4D2, which now possesses none of the elements of “fun” that one would normally expect from a game of that description.</p>

<pre><code>I honestly feel that's a poor comparison... War/video games. 
</code></pre>
<p>I am not really for the war in Iraq/Afghanistan (I served 15 months total in Iraq) But politicians are looking out for not only our county’s well being but the worlds.(But the US is hated the most out of all it <em>seems</em>). (I don’t want to get into theories of conspiracy if that’s what anyone is thinking.)</p>
<pre><code>Although I don't agree with any politicians disposition on violent video games. I believe the leaders involved on the war probably don't give two shits about video game violence. If anything they support them because they feel it possibly "desensitizes" younger children to violence. And in tern gives them a want to be a part of a dramatic adrenaline filled combat scenario then those who have been sheltered with the farm life in Idaho. (Or wherever)  And that can lead to others, political or otherwise to raise a fist towards violent video games. (I'm not stating that as a fact merely a scenario) 
</code></pre>
<p>The thing is, there are ALWAYS going to be people that over react to entertainment violence, whether these people are influential and have power or are Mr and Mrs. joe blow. These people will stand up to violence just because. I don’t know the reason and I don’t care to know. But there is nothing really anyone can do about it. Argue will only create more hate and more hate will only create a more intense passionate fight.</p>
<p>Whenever I have met someone who was against violent video games (even fantasy games like the Final Fantasy series!) I just shook my head and let it go. It’s not worth arguing about. If that’s how they feel them let them hide in their boring stupid box with their picket signs degrading violent games and melt away with time while we go on enjoying what the world has brought to our front doors.</p>
<pre><code>Nothing can change their minds and nothing will change ours. So what is the point really?????? Sorry I have rambled on. I suppose I will get a good flaming, but I don't care.</code></pre>
