    <title>HLSS is pissing me off</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hlss-is-pissing-me-off/4189</link>
    <description>So i tried installing HLSS for tf2, but it never worked. Now that i have half life, the game auto plays my music at the beginning. I tried deleting HLSS but it didnt work, so now I could use some help. 

EDIT: I reinstalled Half life, it didn&#39;t work

EDIT2: I feel stupid. I got really pissed off and deleted every file in my half life directory. I reinstalled again and it fixed it. /thread</description>

            <p>GOD DAMMIT!!! it was working fine, then music started playing again. HLSS uses scripts i beleive but i cant find them. Deleting the sounds didn’t work either.</p>
<p>Edit: The music was playing from my cd drive. Fixed it</p>

            <p>Uninstall Both games, keeping save files from Half-life in a backup file and Delete the remaining files from the steam/steamapps/yourusername/HalfLife and steam/steamapps/yourusername/TF2 directories. Reinstall and Replace the save Files from Half-life… if that doesnt work, I don’t know what to do.<br>
EDIT<br>
ALSO if “permission denied” is the error message you get when Deleting HLSS, Disconnect, Then delete.</p>
