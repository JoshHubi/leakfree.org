    <title>Save Game Function No Longer Works</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/save-game-function-no-longer-works/62378</link>
    <description>Hello,
First let me say that I am an older gamer, having played Half Life when it first came out, and am now playing Black Mesa off Steam.
I love this game.  I have had NO problems at all until now that I have reached the Lambda Core...and am in the process of going into one of the coolant tanks.

Suddenly my game refuses to SAVE in game, or allow me to OVERWRITE a previously saved game.  The screen just stays the same, and there is no &quot;game saved&quot; white letters notification any more.  
I have started and restarted my computer
I have logged into and out of Steam.
I have revalidated the game files twice now on Steam.

I can LOAD a NEW game with the Lambda Chapter, it is unlocked in my game files...but even when I start that level new, the SAVE function no longer works.

I stopped drinking years ago, but might start up again now, as I really am sad.  Any help would really be appreciated.
Thank you.</description>

            <p>Wow.  There’s no doubt that my 999 saves (OK, don’t laugh) prevented me from going any further.  But thanks to you, and the method you taught me how to go into Windows in-game and clear out the clutter, I am back in the saddle again.</p>
<p>Flavrans, you’ve helped me carry on to the finish of this masterpiece, when I couldn’t find a solution anywhere.</p>
<p>I am forever in your debt, and appreciate your help beyond measure.  Thank You!</p>

            <p>Also restart your computer.<br>
Another thing you can do is restart that chapter from the New Game menu just to see if you can save and quick save.</p>

            <p>It’s possible one of your recent saves got corrupted somehow and is preventing the save function from working correctly.</p>
<p>Try deleting your most recent save from the load game menu. Alternatively, launch Black Mesa. When the menu comes up, Alt-Tab to Windows. Then browse to the folder <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bms\save</code> and delete the most recent <code>bms-nnn.sav</code> and <code>bms-nnn.tga</code> files <sup>(save games must be deleted while the game is running, otherwise they will be restored by Steam Cloud synchronization when you launch the game again)</sup>. Return to Black Mesa, try loading a game or start a new game, and try saving a game again.</p>
<p>If deleting the most recent save doesn’t fix it, try deleting the autosaves and/or quick saves. Or better yet, delete all the files from the save folder. In this case, you’ll have to start a new game from the Lambda Chapter.</p>
