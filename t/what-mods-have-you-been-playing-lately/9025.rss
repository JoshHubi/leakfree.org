    <title>What Mods Have You Been Playing Lately?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-mods-have-you-been-playing-lately/9025</link>
    <description>This thread is meant to be similar to the [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=1297&#39;]&quot;What Game Did You Play Today?&quot;[/url]thread.  Except, of course, this one&#39;s focused specifically on mods.  So this way anyone can show off what mods they&#39;ve been playing and share them with the rest of us.  Feel free to post your screenshots for the mods too.  Oh, and when Black Mesa is released, first one to say they&#39;ve been playing it gets a cookie. :freeman:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I&#39;ll start us off:

I tried out [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/science-and-industry&#39;]Science and Industry[/url] for the first time today.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find any active servers and just ended playing by myself  :frowning:   The game looks promising though.</description>

<p>why u guys keep posting non source mods?<br>
I bet there are lot of source mods or games powered by source that many of you dont know, like Vindictus<br>

</aside>
<p>Um, because it’s not a thread exclusively about Source mods? Additionally, given that this community is BASED around the creation of a Source mod and are therefore interested in such things, we’re probably likely to know the vast majority of those already.</p>

            <p>Yeah, and it’s a really fucking long mod too. The atmosphere is fantastic, probably one of the better post apoc settings I’ve seen in a game. Some really creepy parts too. Still havent finished it yet, got tired of getting stuck constantly.</p>

            <p>Decided to play a bit more of Gstring. God damn MyoHyo’s level design is fucked up. Like, it looks great, but it just doesn’t flow well at all. That being said, sometimes I have to do shit I never thought I’d have to do in order to make progress, like use a tree to get over a concrete wall, so that’s pretty cool. I just have to keep in mind that the only way to move forward is to hug every corner and look for little ledges I can climb onto and shit.<br>
Hopefully V2 is a bit more fluid.</p>

            <p>Played a lot of half-life mods when I finally got half-life. Both Poke646 games, They Hunger Trilogy, Sweet Half-Life, Half-life: Redux, Half-life: Zombie Edition, Sven Co-op, Afraid of Monsters: Directors Cut, and Cry of Fear. I haven’t played much of AoM: DC &lt;.&lt;. I intend to play it, but it seems rather scary  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> . But I have played co-op of Cry of Fear.</p>

            <p>Residual Life for Half-Life. Really captures the cold, obsolete industrial mope-ride vibes that the original game failed to deliver. It’s like Michael Crichton beat up Mark Laidlaw, took his script for Half-Life, and fixed all the parts he thought were too cool.</p>

<p>One of few endings.<br>
The choices you make lead you to a path to a certain ending.</p>

<p>Love that one.  I kind of like the mods that tried to make a Half-Life 2 before it even came out.  Very interesting.</p>
<p>I also semi-recently played  <a href="https://www.planetphillip.com/posts/black-ops-half-life/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Black Ops</a>, a HL mod that puts you into the Black Ops.  Except there’s not as much of Black Mesa as there is other locations in some city.</p>
