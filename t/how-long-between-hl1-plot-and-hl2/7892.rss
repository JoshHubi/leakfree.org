    <description>I know this is a not typical question but I suspect you guys might just have a simpler answer than some I have found on my own.

      Just how much time passed between the G-Man putting you into limbo/stasis at the end of Half-life 1 and you finding your sorry bum on a train with two guys in blue clothes complaining about relocation in HL2?</description>

            <p>She looks younger than 7, lol; About 2 or 3.</p>
<p>That would make her about 22-23ish when Gordon is 27.<br>
But considering that Alyx doesn’t know about Gman’s stasis, I’d say she probably thinks Gordon is 47.</p>

            <p>There is <a href="https://images.wikia.com/half-life/en/images/2/2f/Frame002a.jpg" data-bbcode="true">a photo of Alyx (as a young child), Eli and his wife, Azian</a>.  Azian was killed during the aftermath of the Resonance Cascade and only Eli and Alyx survived along with the photo.  There can only be a certain amount of time (say, 20 years) between the Alyx in the photo and the Alyx you meet pummeling the Metrocops.</p>

            <p>When HL2 was released there wasn’t any PR statement about it but someone at Valve, I think, said it was 10 years. Then the Aftermath / Episode One webpage said it was ‘two decades.’ So there is your official statement, I guess.</p>

            <p>I realize this. That’s why I said assumption. But I’m pretty sure that’s what the plot difference is based on, I don’t think it’s been officially stated.</p>

<p>Twenty years Aylx is 7 in Half-Life 1 Freeman is 27 so after 20 years in stasis Gordon and Ms Vance are both twenty seven, therfore a ‘more than friends’ relationship is quite likely in a future HL installment.</p>
