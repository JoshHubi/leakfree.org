    <title>The only file in BMS is the .7z file HELP</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-only-file-in-bms-is-the-7z-file-help/11497</link>
    <description>When I run the setup it only puts one file (BlackMesa.7z) into
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS

Should it not be installing other files to the BMS directory?

I&#39;ve scoured the internet and cannot for the life of me figure this out.

I install it to the default folder.
After the setup is done, I restart steam and that stupid &quot;gameinfo.txt is missing&quot; screen pops up.

            <p>I got it working. I downloaded the file from one of their mirrors (multiple times) but they must have gotten messed up somehow. I found a completely different site and downloaded it from there and everything is peachy. Very weird. Thanks for the help.</p>
