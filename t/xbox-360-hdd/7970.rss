    <title>Xbox 360 HDD</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xbox-360-hdd/7970</link>
    <description>OK, so I had a Xbox awhile ago that got the &#39;red ring of death&#39; while I was playing it. It never got repaired, but I still have the HDD thing that was attached to the side of it. Is it safe to use on a new Xbox?

It has also been in the garage for about 6 months.</description>

            <p>No don’t format it! You will lose the security sectors you need for it to work on the console and will have to reinstall them.</p>
<p>Your hdd won’t cause a RROD, at worst system lock ups but test with and without.</p>

            <p>I can’t see why it wouldn’t be safe to use. I’ve never heard of a RROD that was caused by the HDD. But if you want to be really sure that it’s not damaged, open it up, remove the 2.5" HDD and plug it into your computer, format it and then check for errors.(If you don’t format it you won’t be able check for errors, but if you have old saves on it that you want to play, just plug it in your new xbox and test it.)</p>
