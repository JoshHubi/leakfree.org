    <description>Hello

Last night I downloaded the mod: Black Mesa

[url]https://www.blackmesasource.com[/url]

Everything I did for proper startup and operation of the game:

How to play:

Game: Black Mesa install into your STEAM folder usuall it looks like this:

&quot;C: \ Program Files (x86) \ Steam \

You will also need: Source SDK Base 2007, Which Also install.

Farther, you must restart your steam and run it again.

Then it Would Be in your games library installed should see the availability of Black Mesa and now you can run

I do not know why it does not work.
I run the game through steam loading splash screen before the main menu. The game completely crashes. Game will crash and show up on the desktop. The error message: ENGINE ERROR - Could not client library

Can you please help to solve the problem?</description>
