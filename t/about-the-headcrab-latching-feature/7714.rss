    <title>About the headcrab latching feature..</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/about-the-headcrab-latching-feature/7714</link>
    <description>I know it was removed for various reasons, but I just figure there&#39;s no reason it couldn&#39;t be included as a one time off, scripted event, maybe with NPCs around to help the player work out to get it off. Or you could have the NPCs be fighting them off as well. Well?</description>
