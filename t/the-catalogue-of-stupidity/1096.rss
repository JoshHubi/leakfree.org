    <title>The Catalogue of Stupidity</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-catalogue-of-stupidity/1096</link>
    <description>As of today, August 3, 2009, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population of the United States to be 307,057,144 living persons. But being a nation notorious for stupidity, many may wonder just how many thousands or millions of people are incompetent. This is a project to catalogue every idiot possible through sampling their YouTube comments/videos, whether they are subject to a Living Darwin Award, their actions over X-BOX live or another online service and many more. 

Here are the rules for posting someone:

If it was a youtube user, their comment (or part of it- it MUST exemplify their stupidity) and username must be posted. If they uploaded a video, their username and a link to their video must be posted.

If they won a living darwin award or an honorable mention, a link to their story must be posted (make sure it happened in the United States and the story was &quot;confirmed by darwin&quot;.

If they were an X-BOX live user/Playstation online/ Steam/ X-fire user, the stiry of their actions must be posted, their Gamertag/Account name/username, and the name of the online servive must be posted.

Every month, or when I deem necessary, the total number of people found to be &quot;guilty&quot; of stupid will be subtracted from the population figures today to reveal the number of people competent in the United States today. 

This project is not funded by any source and I, Pkemon Eater, made it up today and is a completely independent project.

And perhaps most importantly, I depend on the cooperation of the Black Mesa community members and myself to make this project succeed.</description>

            <p>I knew this guy Jeff. He sucked the intelligence out of a room. You were dumber for having spent time within sight of him. He was like a black hole of intelligence. It disappears forever, never to be seen again. You can’t get t it, and neither can he.</p>
