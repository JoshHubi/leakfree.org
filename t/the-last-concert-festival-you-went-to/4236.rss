    <description>In spirit if the &quot;What are you listening to&quot; and &quot;Last film you saw&quot; threads: a thread where you post the last concert/festival/music related event you went to and &quot;review it&quot;.

---

I went to Dinosaur Jr and Built to Spill in the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels yesterday. Sadly, we missed half of Built to Spill due to missing our train (and having to grab something to eat beforehand), but the bit I actually witnessed was really good, sounded great, though it&#39;s not really music that makes you go wild.

Dinosaur Jr started with some plagued sound, the vocals didn&#39;t manage to get over the wall of instrumental sound (frigging wall of Marshall stacks for one guitar (so damn tasty)), but that was mainly because of bad PA positioning, it was a lot better when we moved 4-5 rows back. Per usual, Mascis didn&#39;t really interact with the audience that often (well, never, apart from the end, where he said &quot;Thank you!&quot;. Barlow did most of the talking.

Not the best concert I&#39;ve seen, but still very enjoyable, but that might just be because I -love- Dinosaur Jr.

8/10


Next up: Garcia sings Kyuss (next Saturday) and Megadeth (June 8th)</description>
