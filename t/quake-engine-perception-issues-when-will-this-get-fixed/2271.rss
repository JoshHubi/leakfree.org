    <title>Quake Engine Perception Issues... When Will this Get Fixed?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/quake-engine-perception-issues-when-will-this-get-fixed/2271</link>
    <description>Ever wondered why is it in a videogame which uses technology developed from the original Quake engine your weapons seen to have no prescence in the game&#39;s world? 

Look at it this way: remember DOOM? The guns were 2D. Even today, the weapons in all games using the Quake engine, including new titles such as CODMW2, are actually two dimensional objects with no prescence in the game world. They don&#39;t bang into walls and whatnot. 

What I&#39;m wondering is, how could first-person shooters actually utilize 3D weapon models which actually have physical attributes, so every time I walk into a wall my gun taps it or slides across?</description>

<p>Yeah… maybe someone could like get gears of war and somehow mount the view camera so it looked out of the guy’s chest, allowing the camera to show the gun from a sort of first person perspective… it would kill viewmodel problems, but then you’d have to have player models which looked weird. You’d probably have to have viewmodels for players, in an ersatz role-reversal.</p>

<p>Sounds like a pain in the ass if I wanted to stand up against something AND shoot it, or just simply shoot around it.</p>
<p>Although, sounds for guns clacking up against the wall as you walk into them sounds simple enough, though it doesn’t seem worth the effort.(or any effort at all)</p>

</aside>
<p>That sounds fun, the most awesome thing that could ever be programmed into a videogame would be a fully-hudless game where the character’s body would totally react to the physics engine and world and there would be some way to check ones equipment by having the character look themselves up and down and selecting with a key, preferably very quickly. A bit like the new Alone in the Dark, but not shit. And faster. For example if my guy was carrying a boot knife and got knocked down, I’d hold shift, aim the crosshair at the bootknife and click to draw it and use it. Also dropping one’s weapon when knocked over would kick ass.</p>

            <p>View models are huge, so allowing interaction would cause a bit of odd problems like hitting a wall when your 100 HL2 Units away ( It would be like knocking all the shit off your shelf when your across the room ).</p>
<p>It is possible.</p>
<p>The view model is currently not a solid and set to not collide with anything.<br>
Change those two things and bam you got a interactive view model.</p>
<p>Before anyone asks, it will NOT BE a feature in BM.</p>

            <p>Well… technically getting the thing to work would require complex knowlege of… everything to to with FPS games. I guess the Crysis this is as close as we’re gonna get, but if there’s a dev team actually working on a better way of doing FPS you guys gotta let me know.</p>

<p>Ever wondered why is it in a videogame which uses technology developed from the original Quake engine your weapons seen to have no prescence in the game’s world?</p>
<p>Look at it this way: remember DOOM? The guns were 2D. Even today, the weapons in all games using the Quake engine, including new titles such as CODMW2, are actually two dimensional objects with no prescence in the game world. They don’t bang into walls and whatnot.</p>
<p>What I’m wondering is, how could first-person shooters actually utilize 3D weapon models which actually have physical attributes, so every time I walk into a wall my gun taps it or slides across?</p>

</aside>
<p>Good point ,but do we really have the answer to that ?</p>

            <p>You mean like in crysis where if you get close to a wall or object you raise the gun? Or is a workaround not what you are looking for?</p>

<p>It’s generally looked upon as unnecessary and it’d conflict with what the player sees and what everyone else sees. There are little addons for Garry’s Mod that allow that, and they aren’t really helpful.</p>
