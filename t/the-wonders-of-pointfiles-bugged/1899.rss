    <title>The wonders of pointfiles.....bugged!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-wonders-of-pointfiles-bugged/1899</link>
    <description>I am currently doing some level design which involves making an elevator that stops in two places. Surely enough I compile my work but don&#39;t run the game, and yet as I look at the report it says that I have a leak.

So I load up the pointfile and it points me to where the leak is, only to find that it starts from where I placed my second path-track waypoint and then the red line worms its way through the facility that I have created and disappears into a solid brush. Confused I decided to run the map and everything seems to be fine (RAD compiled properly too). Is there a problem with my compiling?

I&#39;m not sure if this is a bug, but I&#39;m also not sure if it will hinder my progress trying to find [b]actual[/b] leaks. I assume the pointfiles will only locate one leak at a time, but will it priorities from the obvious to the most subtle leaks in the level?</description>
