    <title>Which University Should I Attend?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/which-university-should-i-attend/4166</link>
    <description>Hello all.  I have recently been accepted to the following 5 universities:

McMaster
Ottawa
Toronto
Waterloo 
Western Ontario 

Biochemistry is my major.  If you have an opinion on any of these institutions please reply; this is a very difficult decision.</description>

            <p>No actually, no igloos at all here. It’s quite pleasant here in the summer, and fairly mild at the worst during the winter. Saskatoon is a great place to live, the city has lots of stuff. It’s still small, but it’s growing. Another thing to consider when choosing a school is the city that it’s in, which can be a big factor to some people. To me, it’s close to home and has a good engineering program, so I’m all in.</p>

            <p>The bottom line is the utility of what you will learn/retain when you are finished.</p>
<p>You have some questions to ask yourself in this process and really, only you can answer them.</p>
<p>I suppose a few things to consider is the enviroment you will be in. Coming from a well known school does not count for jack if what you end up with a mere name. On the other hand, a school with a good rep is a fractor, in that, they have a good name for a reason. Only you will be able to balance the schools name compared to how you measure up. If you simply want a title, then look for presteige but keep in mind, that then you run the risk of the WHO"S WHO game. (Not what you konw, but who you konw - Bleh - not so many are good at teh social wheel and deal game -just sayin’)</p>
<p>All fancy education is expensive, so if that is a factor, you need to include that in your final decision.</p>
<p>Is you choose one that is known for parties and goofing off, then that is not so helpful, if a life long career is your goal.</p>
<p>If there is some way to find out what the grads have gone on to accomplish from each school, then that is consideration. If there is a high placement rate, likely, they have a good education program.</p>
<p>Do you have a significant other? How far will any of those take you away from them? If you do, how likely is your emotional concerns going to be an issue for you?</p>
<p>Look to the practicle, not the popular, because your talent in your field will mean more in the long haul, than the glip and glamour of the short haul… Yes?</p>
<p>Only you can deceide, so consider many things and list them good and bad, and then choose from there. Smart cookie for looking early.</p>
<p>cheers</p>

            <p>Yeah thing is, and I’m guessing here, not many people in this forum are from Canada. And even so, most of those who are from there probably won’t have much knowledge of the background of such universities.</p>
<p>Basically, you’ll get people picking a random name from the list, and the other people mocking of names such as McMaster. And also some people saying how dumb you are for asking this here.</p>
<p>Consider me a bit of all three. mcmaster lulz</p>

            <p>Hang on a second people. It’s not like he’s started a poll where he applies to the winning university. He’s just asking for people’s opinions. If he was in the UK I’d be happy to give the inside scoop on the universities I’ve either studied at or worked at. Y’know, the kind of thing you don’t get from a prospectus or two hour guided tour by the only people to volunteer on a day off.</p>

            <p>Indeed it is one of the most important decisions of my life, which is exactly why I would ask for advice on the subject.  Perhaps when you are going through this process and finding out that it is impossible to receive honest opinion about different universities, you would understand why someone might come looking for a more firsthand non-endorsed assessment.  Also, it is very odd that you would assume my final decision would be entirely based on this thread.</p>

<p>I would take the opinion of a random person on the internet more seriously than any “student ambassador” getting paid to embellish the qualities of a particular school any day of the week.  If you have not noticed by now, people tend to not hold back when they have strong feelings toward something in this place.</p>
