    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-buy-stemabox/12787</link>
    <description>this question has bee bothering me reasently, why would anyone want a steambox?

I am a pc gamer, but i might be willing to buy a console, but only for the reason that there are some games that i am a big fan off, that cannot be played on pc

for examnple 
Nintendo&#39;s Zelda &amp; Metroid
Playstations Final Fantasy

i dont see what steambox has to offer that for example an xbox one or pS4 doesnt have. It might be linux and all but personaly i never used linux (well only ubonto to try it out once), but i dont see the benefit of that either</description>

<p>an issue with it will be its power, like the PS3 and Xbox 360 are “out dated” while pc games keep on envolving, they might be albe todo software upodates but i dont think hardware updates will be available. while a normal pc can still be easely upgraded</p>

<p>As Bur above me said, Valve has confirmed that Steamboxes should in fact be upgradable.</p>
<p>The SteamBox is a pre-built PC with a slim form factor running a console OS. Simple as that. As others have said, it makes PC gaming significantly more accessible to the console gaming market. It’s for console gamers looking for an easy transition into the PC gaming sphere without losing the console experience.</p>
<p>The cool thing in all this is not the SteamBox itself. Pre-builts with slim form factors are nothing new. The important things are the OS and controller, which could be used with your current gaming PC (at no cost for the OS) to give you a much much better living room experience (better in fact than anything PCs OR consoles currently offer) in addition to your windows/desktop based gaming. I just hope Valve revives splitscreen gamin which seems to have largely died on console and PC.</p>

            <p>Don’t forget that you’ll be able to switch parts in a Steambox just as easily as in PC.</p>
<p>So you could get a Steambox because it’s cheap and convenient (honestly, I think at least at first the Steambox will be cheaper than an equivalent self-built PC), and basically use it as a PC.</p>

            <p>Because it offers the convenience of the consoles with the versatility of the PC, not to mention extra features such as streaming. Also, Steam Controller seems awesome.</p>

            <p>A Stemabox? That sounds like stemmeboks, which is danish for voting booth, do I have to vote now? I’M ONLY 15, I DON’T WANT TO VOTE.</p>
<p>… in all seriousness, pretty much what almost everyone else said. It’s made for people who just can’t be bothered with building a PC, but want the power of one anyway.</p>

            <p>If you are an avid PC gamer who knows how to build your own rigs, then the Steambox is not for you.</p>
<p>If you want all the advantages of PC gaming with the advantages of console gaming, then the Steambox is for you.</p>
<p>Simple really, the Steambox is for the demographic that wants a powerful gaming PC ready to connect to a TV but doesn’t know/have time to build their own PC box.</p>

<p>steambox mightm ake this more accesable.</p>
<p>an issue with it will be its power, like the PS3 and Xbox 360 are “out dated” while pc games keep on envolving, they might be albe todo software upodates but i dont think hardware updates will be available. while a normal pc can still be easely upgraded</p>

            <p>The reason why I would buy a Steambox?</p>
<p>Because it’s a console that can run PC games, allowing me to get a cheaper computer for work and web and not have it be painfully outdated within half a year.</p>
<p>But all of this depends on the final price of a high-end Steambox.</p>

            <p>I think the goal for the steamboxes is to get the strength and versatility of PC gaming and entertainment out of the workstation and into the living room.<br>
It’s for people who want to sit on their ass with a controller and enjoy their games luxuriously and still have the option to whip out a wireless keyboard and write an essay.<br>
An environmental shift from the dark cramped slimy dungeon most of us occupy.</p>
<p>It’s not a binary of <span class="bbcode-i">“hunch over a desk smash wasd and go on forums”</span> or <span class="bbcode-i">“sit on couch”</span> as much as it is a third option.<br>
Whether or not this third option is a fusion of the first two or something new entirely is dependent on the creativity of the user. not everyone is so open to change.</p>
<p>It’s nothing that can’t already be done with a computer hooked up to a quad-hd 90" television and some wireless peripherals.<br>
The steambox aims to offer this in a condensed, reliably powerful device that you could feasibly do anything with as far as storage and transport goes.</p>
<p>To be brief: Don’t fight the future, you miserable wet sack of chips.</p>
