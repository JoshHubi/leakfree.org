    <title>Who is making BMS Co-op mod?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/who-is-making-bms-co-op-mod/6151</link>
    <description>Rumor has it that in exactly two months time BMS will be released in march!

So who here is going to make the BMS Co-op mod? How is it going to be presented to the community?</description>

            <p>Sure does.  I think just simply saying the rumors were false would have been good.  Granted there’d be more rage but It’d die out real quick.</p>

<p>Breaking news folks…</p>
<p>I am sorry but do not expect the game to come out within the next two months.</p>
<p>That is all.  :wipes the tears from her eyes:</p>

</aside>
<p>I stand by that statement, but lets clarify something. The only reason I said that was because due to <span class="bbcode-i">someone </span>mentioning <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">something </span></span></span>might happen at the end of the year, there was a big stir happening throughout the forum.   MY statement is only saying what NOT to expect. It is not saying what WILL happen or at what time.</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>

            <p>NOOB!</p>
<p>nah, just kidding, but i hate it when people like the OP take stuff a developer says, like when catz said “don’t expect anything from the mod in the next two months” and turns it into “HOLY SHIT THE MOD IS GONNA BE RELEASED IN TWO MONTHS!”</p>

            <p>the rumor of 2 months until release was started by people who read things but don’t comprehend them.  Raminator recently stated that the mod would NOT be released anytime within the next two months.  That didn’t state that the mod would be released after that time, simply that it wouldn’t be released before then.  People who can’t comprehend that have taken it to mean a release date of late Feb or early March.</p>
