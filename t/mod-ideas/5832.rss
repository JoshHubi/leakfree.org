<blockquote>
<p>A 3-4 hour long clue-like game where you have to investigate several seemingly unrelated major crimes. In which the characters, motives, locations &amp; such are procedurally generated in a random-story-generator sort of way so that each game would be mostly different. The player should use basic forensic tools to get as much evidence as possible, as well as small notebook to reference what characters have said &amp; what evidence they have. The player should also be able to ask npcs basic who/what/where/when/why/how questions, as well as inform them of your evidence &amp; what other npcs have said. Both the player &amp; the npcs should be capable of lying to throw one another off. This could be mixed-up with a little bit of simplistic beat-'em-up or stealth if the gameplay seems a bit too stale or poorly paced on it’s own.</p>

            <p>it actually started as a mod but we have recently been pushing towards a standalone udk based game</p>
<p>The only problem is I haven’t been able to get much of a team together and this project is way too big for just two guys.</p>
<p>And yeah the gameplay and general atmosphere (but not the story) were greatly influenced by Deus ex which is my favorite video game of all time  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>DAYLIGHT:  a dystopian cyberpunk fps-rpg originally conceptualized as a total conversion mod for unreal 3</p>
<p>Story:</p>
<pre><code>  "It's in man's DNA to expand, his nature to destroy. For too many years we have been pillaging the earths natural resources en mass, the rain forests of the world came crashing down like piles of tomorrows garbage. We expanded too fast and with our lust for consumption we have robbed the world of its most precious natural resource. The ozone was weakening, and we were the cause. Plant-life began to fade, and what animal life had survived the mass deforestation was left with almost no viable food source and under the relentless rays of the sun began to change, to lash out, against man... and ultimately in their desperation, against each other.


  The ground soon began to burn with a ghostly fire. The radiation set on us by the Sun spread upon the distant horizon. When at last we were backed into a corner, industry, The very villain that had brought us so close to the edge of extinction became our only hope.


  A small group of scientists had foreseen this fate and had been working in secret on a plan, a plan to fill the sky with artificial clouds that would block out the Sun and its deadly rays while pouring down a healing rain to cool our sweltering climate. The barren lands that once held mighty trees was now to be the home of gleaming metal foundations, wires, tubes, and coolant. Sparkling towers that reached over the heights of the trees that were once their fore-bearers.

  It was not by any means perfect. The sun was gone and with it went any form of what was once called "nature" but we were alive, and for the time being there was peace.


  But after many years the once gleaming towers began to crumble and decay, The harmless rain they had once poured down turned acidic and became as a pestilence upon man. Over time the burning rains began to spread and once again we were afraid. But this time we, the masses were not joined by the wealthy aristocracy. Those who owned the towers, and should have cared for them were overcome with another lust... one for power and control. For with the towers damaged a new advantage was revealed to the ruling class. That they could control us like cattle, force upon us whatever way of life that they saw fit. They began to use our own fear as a weapon against us.


  Terror now reigns around the world. Uni-chem, The principle corporation in charge of maintaining the towers has positioned itself as the ruling world power. They create the law and enforce it with ghastly man made soldiers who stalk from street to street. People are taken in the night. A lucky few are beaten in interrogation, released with broken ribs and noses but most are never seen again.


  Blood flows in the streets of this dark twisted metropolis, and the those in charge of Uni-chem known only as "The Board" are riding in on it.

  Those who managed fled to The Zone. The lawless country between the cities where the towers lie and acidic rain still pours. Zone 00 is ours. It stretches the whole of ruined North America. Dotting the country side between Mega cities lie shanty towns and rebel outposts crawling with villainy, prostitution, and black market sales.

  It is here, Within The Zone that the last hope for freedom lies, a resistance. A rebellion is against those on the top, The men on their gleaming pedestals, The Armored fortresses of UniCHEM, And anyone left in the world who would seek to push down the common man. And time is ticking. "


  Setting:

  A dystopian future in which major conglomerates rule the burned out shell of Chicago.

  The current location is a 1 Mile square section of Chicago near Sears Tower. The area will begin to expand as time allows

<p>That sounds EXTREMELY awesome. At first it kind of sounded like Deus Ex (the man) which was a relly good game, despite the graphics. then I kept reading and and WOW. But how long do you think a mod like this would take? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>If it were a GAME, I would buy it and give it a full try before passing judgement. Really cool story idea.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Plant-life began to fade, and what animal life had survived the mass deforestation was left with almost no viable food source and under the relentless rays of the sun began to change, to lash out, against man... and ultimately in their desperation, against each other.


  The ground soon began to burn with a ghostly fire. The radiation set on us by the Sun spread upon the distant horizon. When at last we were backed into a corner, industry, The very villain that had brought us so close to the edge of extinction became our only hope.


  A small group of scientists had foreseen this fate and had been working in secret on a plan, a plan to fill the sky with artificial clouds that would block out the Sun and its deadly rays while pouring down a healing rain to cool our sweltering climate. The barren lands that once held mighty trees was now to be the home of gleaming metal foundations, wires, tubes, and coolant. Sparkling towers that reached over the heights of the trees that were once their fore-bearers.

  It was not by any means perfect. The sun was gone and with it went any form of what was once called "nature" but we were alive, and for the time being there was peace.


  But after many years the once gleaming towers began to crumble and decay, The harmless rain they had once poured down turned acidic and became as a pestilence upon man. Over time the burning rains began to spread and once again we were afraid. But this time we, the masses were not joined by the wealthy aristocracy. Those who owned the towers, and should have cared for them were overcome with another lust... one for power and control. For with the towers damaged a new advantage was revealed to the ruling class. That they could control us like cattle, force upon us whatever way of life that they saw fit. They began to use our own fear as a weapon against us.


  Terror now reigns around the world. Uni-chem, The principle corporation in charge of maintaining the towers has positioned itself as the ruling world power. They create the law and enforce it with ghastly man made soldiers who stalk from street to street. People are taken in the night. A lucky few are beaten in interrogation, released with broken ribs and noses but most are never seen again.


  Blood flows in the streets of this dark twisted metropolis, and the those in charge of Uni-chem known only as "The Board" are riding in on it.

  Those who managed fled to The Zone. The lawless country between the cities where the towers lie and acidic rain still pours. Zone 00 is ours. It stretches the whole of ruined North America. Dotting the country side between Mega cities lie shanty towns and rebel outposts crawling with villainy, prostitution, and black market sales.

  It is here, Within The Zone that the last hope for freedom lies, a resistance. A rebellion is against those on the top, The men on their gleaming pedestals, The Armored fortresses of UniCHEM, And anyone left in the world who would seek to push down the common man. And time is ticking. "


  Setting:

  A dystopian future in which major conglomerates rule the burned out shell of Chicago.

  The current location is a 1 Mile square section of Chicago near Sears Tower. The area will begin to expand as time allows

<p>The story did not even freaking make sense. I honestly think the GTA series makes a better storyline - it’s at least more believable.</p>

<p>Not at all.<br>

</aside>
<p>A shame that the endings were a bit of a cop out, considering how the plot develops and what happens between two of the characters.</p>
<p>“Your lips… they’re so… cold…”</p>
<p>Whoever wrote that scene should be dragged into the street and shot in the face. It was hammy and it was one of the many ways in which the ending was fucked beyond all belief. Considering what happens to Lucas towards the end, that seemed like an ass pull too. I personally think the end could have used some major rewriting.</p>

            <p>Make a mod, that acts like the ant-lion holdout in Episode 2. Except add in ALL the enemies, in waves. So like Nazi Zombies, except with Combine, Ant-Lions, Zombies, Scanners, hunters, headcrabs, ect.</p>
<p>Make it harder each level, and add in a boss for the hell of it. Like a Strider or a APC or something.</p>
<p>Make it a big thing where you need a specific weapon to kill them. Make players pay for weapons using points they get from killing. JUST like Nazi Zombies with a Half Life 2 twist and Half Life 2 maps.</p>
<p>Then, make it multiplayer  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I would actually BUY a game like that.</p>
