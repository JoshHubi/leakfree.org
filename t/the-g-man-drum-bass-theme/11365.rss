    <title>&quot;The G-Man&quot; Drum &amp; Bass theme</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-g-man-drum-bass-theme/11365</link>
    <description>I loved Black Mesa so much, I just had to make a track. So I used the g-mans voice from the various games and made a violent fast-paced drum&amp;bass track.
It will be free to download once it&#39;s finished. (all my finished tracks are free)
Hope you like it.

            <p>I tried something slightly different, I put it at the end of a longer break. I might add some other sample for a short break, like one of the HEV-suit warnings.<br>
This is what is sounds like for now. (same link) Let me know what you think.</p>

            <p>Just after (or in-between) a ‘<span class="bbcode-i">break</span>’ is what I meant.</p>
<p>Maybe, after a short ‘<span class="bbcode-i">calm down</span>’, which could last a few seconds, add the line I mentioned and transition to another peak (or the rest of the song), afterwards.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[B]... [PEAK][/B]►►► "[I]Prepare for Unforeseen Consequences...[/I]"[B] ◄◄◄[PEAK] ...[/B]</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> I hope the '<span class="bbcode-i">diagram’</span> above isn’t too hard to understand, I was just trying to illustrate a peak-to-peak transition (of some sort).</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll figure something out, if the idea / suggestion doesn’t fit, just drop it (if you want to).  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Cool, thanks.<br>
Great idea, i’ll see if I can fit that somewhere  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
Just to clarify though, did you mean in-between (behind the bassline), or right before the drop? Or even in-between as a break?<br>
Anyhow, thanks for the suggestion! I’ll try it out tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Nice one, I like it!</p>
<p>No, wait… that’s such a standard answer, let me rephrase that:</p>
<p>It’s fantastic - I love it, but it needs more ‘<span class="bbcode-i">highlights</span>’, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Simply put, I’d like to throw in a suggestion here:</p>
<p>For (one of) the peak(s) of the song, why not use something like “<span class="bbcode-i"><em>Whispering</em>: Prepare for Unforeseen Consequences…</span>” (click the link, for a video), then transition to said peak(s).</p>
<p>This’s just an idea though, you’re the artist - do whatever you like best!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
