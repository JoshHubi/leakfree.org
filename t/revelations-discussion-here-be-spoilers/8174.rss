    <description>Man oh man, what an ending!

Not only do we see the final resting place of Altair, but we also have the first clear shot of the First Civilization...where they lived, their architecture, what they looked like.  We even see the Catastrophe that ended it all.

But these people that filled the streets...were they human?  Or Those Who Came Before?</description>

            <p>Aye.  I just found out about Ascendance…must watch that VERY soon.  And there’s also apparently this good comic series that details some very important shit in terms of current-day Assassin/Templar relations.</p>

            <p>The reason Ezio’s chronicla worked so well was because it followed him from a roudy boy at 17 to a wise leader at 53…not even mentioning Embers, the short film following Revelations (which you should DEFINITELY watch).</p>

            <p>I agree- Ezio felt like a leader of men this time around. You really get why he’s so important. In ACII, he was a naive man looking for justice. Over the course of the next two games he gets older, wiser, and becomes a competent leader for the Order. It’s rare to see a character so fleshed out in terms of living through a person’s entire lifespan over successive games, and in that regard Ubisoft took a gamble in thinking that Ezio’s life over three games would remain compelling. Surprisingly, it worked. But yeah, bring on 3.</p>

            <p>I really did like the whole Assassin Brotherhood concept, though.  In the previous games, it really felt like it was you against the Templar Order without any help.  They made you feel like you were the last member of the Brotherhood.  But in this game, they extended the concept to the point where it felt like you were actually leading a <span class="bbcode-i">huge</span> group, the size of which is breathtaking.</p>
<p>The contract missions were done terrifically, your apprentices had this personal feel to them, and when you called upon their aid it seemed much more fluid.</p>
<p>The Altair missions especially, where as an old man you hardly had to kill anyone because your followers did it for you.</p>

<p>It’s because they didn’t have any budget left after getting John de Lancie.<br>
(probably not true, but you know)</p>
<p>I disliked how half-assed the Desmond sequences were.  If I wanted to do decent first person platforming, I’d play Mirror’s Edge.  This wasn’t nearly as good, but still less frustrating.</p>

            <p>I think the entire Animus island concept was used as a shortcut for the devs, which is just plain lazy. They didn’t have to expand the Desmond plot or do much in terms of voice work in present day. Now that I think of it, this bugged me the most. After the brotherhood cliffhanger I expected that revelations would have dealt with the Desmond bit right off the bat.</p>

            <p>Yeah, if not a little underdeveloped.  I would have liked if there were more ways you could interact with the world.  I also was hoping for more to be unlocked as I collected more data fragments, but oh well.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, the Animus Island as a whole seemed like a conglomerate of wasted potential.  There was so much they could have done, but alas</p>

<p>and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix Desmond, he looks so shitty as of Revelations.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I appreciate that they brought some phong into the game, but damn Desmond looks completely different.  I know Desmond, Altair, and Ezio all had the same face in AC1 and 2, at least try to keep it looking similar instead of completely different, Ubisoft!</p>
<p>But yeah, the story did feel lacking.</p>
<p>And Keeper, I refer to The Lost and Damned and Saints Row 3 again.  In TLAD, Brian was just dead with no explanation other than “Brian got killed” in a mission briefing. (it was Brian, right? I only played through TLAD once)  In SR3, Gat gets shot in a cutscene, but instead of going out in a blaze of glory, as one would expect from him, he gets cut off mid sentence, over the radio, by gunfire.</p>

            <p>I find the game lacked a compelling Ezio story compared to the whole Italy/Borgia debacle. Istanbul didn’t really have the zing Italy had. Not to mention the tower defense crap game.</p>
<p>Like most of you, I’m mostly pissed about how tight lipped they were with whats happening with Lucy. How could they kill off a major character like that and merely have a “oh we buried her in a small cemetery in Rome” mention? Revelations my ass. Why did Juno kill her!? We were with 16 the entire game and he doesn’t explain what he meant in the brotherhood truth? However, I don’t agree with the speculation that she may not be dead after-all because that would absolutely make no sense. Short of having you wake up at the beginning of ACIII and everything is explained as a dream sequence.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure. ACIII will have a lot of explaining to do.</p>

            <p>The annualization of AC will eventually hurt it. I wouldn’t mind waiting at least 2 years between each game, instead of just 1, if that meant a bigger game with more relevant innovations.</p>

            <p>You’re right, it does seem like he should be gone.  We don’t know if the Animus did the same thing when 16 died, apart from him having to do something similar to what Desmond had to do.</p>
<p>Even so, Rebecca’s Animus was finished with a copy of Abstergo’s Animus.  Assuming they didn’t wipe the data from the unit Desmond used, 16 could still be “alive” at Abstergo, at least.</p>

            <p>From what I can tell, Subject 16 is no more.  He was deleted while the Animus did that huge deletion sweep.</p>

</aside>
<p>It wasn’t nearly as disappointing as Brian in The Lost and Damned, or Johnny in Saints Row 3.  You got to see Desmond stab her, and they were in a hole in the ground, it wasn’t likely that she wouldn’t bleed out before they got her out.</p>
<p>There were some problems with the game, but overall I found it fun.  I will be done with the series if the next game isn’t AC3, though.  It feels like they’re stretching it out too much.</p>
<p>Not right away, but pretty early on I thought 16 was going to take over Desmond’s body at the end.  Kinda glad he ended up being a bro, and hey, if the system shut down when 16 died, yet he was still there when it came back up, there’s no reason he won’t be there again in the future.  Maybe he’ll take over one of the Templar trainees, assuming the Animii at Abstergo all use the same code base as the one in Desmond’s room, instead of an image from before the final version was run with 16.</p>

<p>Aw, but AC is BUILT on plot and lore, that’s the main reason I play the games.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know that and I do love the plot too but I leave deep plot analysis for movies and books. Even though a good plot is still important, gameplay matters most in games.</p>
