    <title>Military Vox Effect/Processing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/military-vox-effect-processing/15162</link>
    <description>To all the sound designers on the team, I was wondering what processing and effects were put on the military vox in WGH and onwards.
it&#39;s probably my favourite part of the game (weirdly enough), and i wanted to create a similar effect myself.
so, what effects were put on the voice? thanks  :thumbsup:</description>
