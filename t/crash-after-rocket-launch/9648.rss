    <title>Crash after Rocket Launch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-after-rocket-launch/9648</link>
    <description>This is different from the other On a Rail bug another guy posted...or at least I think it is.

I launched the rocket and quickly progressed to the next area where the freight tram is. I decided to save, as it was calm, and went forwards. It hit the load screen, and I got the first error (*_23C0.mdmp) as CMDL Cache ran out of memory. I had seen something similar earlier (but didn&#39;t manage to grab it&#39;s details), so I shrugged it off and restarted the game. Loaded the save I did just before the crash, and this time, the same thing happened, but with no visible error message. I got the Windows &quot;hl2.exe is not responding&quot; message (*_31c0.mdmp).

Otherwise, I&#39;ve had a pretty bug free play till this point. It happened twice in a row, so IDK what to make of that. I&#39;ll probably just load the previous save and try again.

            <p>I got the same problem, stuck at that one spot on the tram system. It’s been a bit buggy through the whole game though, had another crash but loaded fine afterwards. Hope the fix it soon lol</p>

<p>I am also stuck at this point in the game.  It automatically quick saved right after entering the area with the freight tram after exiting the rocket launch area but the door to the rocket area had not closed yet behind me.  The game crashed one time in an earlier part of the game but seemed to work fine after simply starting it up again at that point.  I’m stuck now because it reliably crashes for me.</p>
