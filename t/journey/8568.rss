If you haven&#39;t heard, thatgamecompany&#39;s (thats their name) third game came out yesterday on PSN. Unfortunately they signed an exclusivity contract with Sony (which ended with this game). So those who don&#39;t have a PS3 will not be able to play this beauty. In any case, I saw there was no thread for this game, and I thought that I might as well start one.

The game uses an interesting take on co-op. Players who are able, are connected to another player, with which they can follow, lead, or ignore. These other players lack any titles or usernames and communication is limited to a wordless &quot;shout&quot;. Co-operative play is entirely voluntary, and the game can be beaten without even seeing eachother, but from what I&#39;ve heard the wordless understanding two players have for each other when playing really adds to the experience.

            <p>I played it in the middle of the night last night and barely ran into any co-op buddies, but I can vouch for it as an amazing single player experience as well. It’s a lot different that way, but very cool in its own right.</p>

            <p>This is one of those games that I would genuinely by a PS3 just to play, if I had the money.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>It really is too bad that it’s restricted to PS3. It’s a very calming experience. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I’d love to discuss its contents and speculate but I don’t wish to spoil things.</p>
<p>Edit: Perhaps I’ll write in black text soon.</p>

            <p>Just beat it. Truly an amazing experience. Its astounding how much could be told with no words. It elevates the game to the deepest levels of human emotion by doing so, and as a result imo is a deeply spiritual game. I loved my partner, and nearly cried at the end from being separated. I started at 12:45 and its now 2:35 so very short, but worth every penny. Buy it, play it, beat it, repeat the previous 2 parts to your liking, rejoice. Be warned however, as Boromir would say,“one does not simply play <span class="bbcode-b">part</span> of Journey”. Prepare 2-3 hours of time before playing, because unless you or your partner have no heart/s you won’t want to leave the other’s side. Enjoy.</p>
<p>BTW <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/journey/user-reviews" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">these reviews</a> from Metacritic pretty much sum up my thoughts on it.</p>

            <p>I got it today, and literally just completed it.</p>
<p>It’s fucking brilliant.</p>
<p>The co-operative aspect of the game in particular works incredibly well. Unlike most online play, you don’t know who you’re playing with, but the enourmous environments in the game culture a connection between both the players as they progress along the Journey.</p>
<p>In addition, the gameplay itself is very enjoyable, there’s an emphasis on exploration as you play, but it’s not mandatory. The art style is minimalistic and engrossing, the soundtrack is epic.</p>
<p>So yeah, buy this.</p>

            <p>I was a bro to someone yesterday.  It was their second playthrough (you can tell from looking at their cloak) and I showed him a bunch of stuff.  We met in the second level (first available for coop) and played the rest of the game together.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in this game, but does not have a PS3, I had planned on recording a full playthrough this weekend with no commentary, and putting it on YouTube, since I’ve seen people around the web asking for one of those.</p>
