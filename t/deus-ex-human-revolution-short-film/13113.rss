<blockquote>
<p>“Robocop isn’t coming to save you.”</p>
<p>That line doesn’t make any sense where it was placed. Adam Jensen wasn’t upgraded yet when Megan was kidnapped, and they wouldn’t have been paying attention to his recovery enough to know that he was being upgraded when it did happen. Plus, he didn’t return to work until around a month after the initial attack.</p>
<p>The dream sequence was a waste of time.</p>
<p>Why was Bob Page there? He was mentioned (or heard) in the intro of the game, but he wasn’t seen, especially not within arms reach of the mercs that kidnapped Megan. If this is supposed to be a sequel to the game, then the mercs that kidnapped Megan were dead already.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, You could think that it takes place after the game, as she did start to work for him. Maybe something went wrong and she refused to continue. The only problem would be Fedorova, but who knows… But WTF was that robot supposed to be???<br>
On the other note, my friend told me that the begining looked like porn…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>It says in the description it doesn’t follow the narrative of the game. It’s just based on the characters and relationships of the game. Still, I would’ve liked it better if it fit into the narrative somehow, or if it at least HAD a narrative other than “Adam tries to save Megan”. This doesn’t really give you much to think about, it’s just pretty to look at.</p>

</aside>
<p>So it says in the description that they don’t care about the source material unless it looks cool? Good to know. Now I will look for a different screenwriter  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
