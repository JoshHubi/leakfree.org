    <title>HECU medics, and their healing(?)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hecu-medics-and-their-healing/10690</link>
    <description>Hey all, awesome mod played all the half-lifes up to episode 2. 

Im just a bit curious about the sk_ commands about the HECU marine medics,

I noticed that the &quot;sk_human_medic_health_amount&quot; command and am wondering if this is the command that allows the medic to heal his comrades?

if so-&gt; can a healing interval be added like the one that the scientists have? (sk_human_scientist_heal_interval	&quot;60&quot; )

if this is the case as well, I have not noticed the HECU medics healing anyone. I have tested it over and over with noclip/notarget and npc_select along with several other commands to check individual NPC health, and the medics don&#39;t seem to be doing anything....  

perhaps I am making a mistake when I use the command &quot;npc_create npc_human_medic&quot;?   should I be arming them with &quot;healthpacks&quot; or something?

very confusing, some information would be awesome thx!</description>

<p>I hope that is the case, because the level of epicness would be insane. lol Im gettin super nostalgic playing throu the scenes and recreating alien/Hecu battles of my liking!! and the heal ability (if they do indeed have one) would be freakin awesome for the HEcu…</p>
<p>Sure they already seem to be attacking in full force, but comparitively the alien_grunts are stronger 1x1 than the HECU grunts, so i thought the medics might tip the scales.</p>

“sk_human_medic_health_amount” could be about the likelihood of a soldier dropping medkits.<br>
I checked and its the healing valuie for the healthkit that is dropped randomly by soldiers</p>

</aside>
<p>oh nice, I was a bit confused. So the health_amount is just the drop variable for the medics… interesting. So then I take it that is the only difference between medics and grunts?  they have no actual “heal” ability to use on other marines?</p>
