            <p>How will the gameplay be? Crawl &amp; hide? I’m not sure of the combat capabilities of a 2 year old, not to mention puzzle solving (other than putting a square box to a square hole)</p>
<p>The concept is still great, i remember fearing toys moving by themselves and bogeyman shit</p>

            <p>I can only predict that players get ranked by how traumatized their player character grows up to be. Prioritize between receiving a lack of stimulation and sustaining utter paranoia.</p>
<p>I hope the levels are bigger than a single four-bedroom home. Like, a sprawling forested backyard, or a full suburban neighborhood, or a basement that leads to an abandoned bomb-shelter network.</p>
