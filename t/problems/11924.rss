    <description>Hey guys!

Sorry if this is the wrong section...

i have 2 problems with the mod..and i would like some help.

1. My settings wont change... if i change anything, like getting rid of the headbobbing, and then save that change...next time i start the game, the headbobbing is back... and that goes for a couple of other settings...anything you can do about it so it remembers the changes?

2. i cant start the console... i enabeld it in the settings menu, and then added -console in the desktop shortcut...but nothing happens when i press the console key...

EDIT:
ok...so i got the console working.. but..

how do you go about binding keys in console... lets say i wanted to bind O to impulse 101..

the line used to be &quot;bind o impulse 101&quot; right? but i cant get it to work..

in HL2 i had sv_cheats 1 binded to P, and impolse 101 binded to O but i cant get it to work...

also..if you could tell me how to set new max ammo for all the guns =)</description>

            <p>There’s no console command, you have to change the skill.cfg located at “\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS\cfg” for maximum ammo.<br>
For clip sizes, you’ll have to edit corresponding weapon script file located at “\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS\scripts”.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>bind o “impulse 101”</p>
<p>works too</p>
<p>the settings not being remembered is a known issue, it should be fixed in the next update</p>

            <p>The line is "bind “o” “impulse 101"”. You’ll have to show what’s the key and what’s the command by separating them with quotes when the command is more than one word.</p>
