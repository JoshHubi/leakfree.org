    <title>Oh shit fuck- RAM issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/oh-shit-fuck-ram-issue/5328</link>
    <description>I bought some RAM for this guys laptop, because he was running vista with only 1gb, so things were obviously slow. When I stuck the new stick into his laptop, it wouldn&#39;t boot. The RAM stick I used was [url=&#39;https://www.misco.ie/ProductInfo/ProductInfo?productCode=Q100757&#39;]this one.[/url]
Is there any reason as to why this would not work (it fit into the slot fine), or is it just a faulty stick?

EDIT: It&#39;s a Toshiba laptop, but I don&#39;t know which one exactly.</description>

            <p>Well Katana (and thus, I) was not saying that it’s bad for YOU to be doing the work.  It more so applies to the guy you’re doing it for.</p>
<p>I work on computers for my friends and family all the time, and I give them my honest recommendations (whether that includes building a new machine or not) and whatever they choose, I do.  So it goes  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Quoted for truth.  Sure, you can get a dedicated gaming laptop, but it will cost twice as much as a comparatively (or better) performing PC, weigh 15 pounds, have an idling battery life of 45 minutes, and fry eggs in its spare time.  If you’re a mobile gamer, or HAVE to buy a laptop for whatever reason and still want to game, then fine.  But like katana said, if you don’t move around and want to upgrade, desktop FTW.</p>

<p>You can’t just buy a memory stick and put it in a computer then expect it to work properly.</p>
<p>If the PC doesn’t boot then the memory is probably not supported by the motherboard, otherwise check the BIOS to see if the memory is recognized. If it is recognized by the BIOS, make sure to enter the proper voltages and memory timings as the computer will not do this automatically.</p>
<p>I suggest you contact the manufacterer to find out which memory the laptop supports, or look it up on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This.  Laptops are especially finnicky about RAM.  Depending on the model, some can’t even be expanded beyond stock - if it came with 1GB, it’s dying with 1GB.  Others only allow you to add 512 (which is retarded, since you’ll lose dual channel if you run mis-matched RAM).  Finally, you have to check the DIMM slot, voltage, timing and capacity as per the manufacturer, like Jeannotvb said.</p>

I thought I had bought the right kind for his laptop.<br>
Clearly not. I hope I can return it.</p>

            <p>You can’t just buy a memory stick and put it in a computer then expect it to work properly.</p>
<p>If the PC doesn’t boot then the memory is probably not supported by the motherboard, otherwise check the BIOS to see if the memory is recognized. If it is recognized by the BIOS, make sure to enter the proper voltages and memory timings as the computer will not do this automatically.</p>
<p>I suggest you contact the manufacterer to find out which memory the laptop supports, or look it up on the internet.</p>

            <p>I bought some RAM for this guys laptop, because he was running vista with only 1gb, so things were obviously slow. When I stuck the new stick into his laptop, it wouldn’t boot. The RAM stick I used was <a href="https://www.misco.ie/ProductInfo/ProductInfo?productCode=Q100757" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this one.</a><br>
Is there any reason as to why this would not work (it fit into the slot fine), or is it just a faulty stick?</p>
<p>EDIT: It’s a Toshiba laptop, but I don’t know which one exactly.</p>
