    <title>Copyright Violation?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/copyright-violation/12783</link>
    <description>Hey guys.
I&#39;ve been wanting to create my own Black Mesa T-shirt for a while now. The thing is, though, is that it would include the Black Mesa logo, which is no doubt copyrighted. My question: would making a custom shirt that used the Black Mesa logo be a copyright violation if I did not intend to profit from it?
Thanks.</description>

            <p>I actually tried to get a black mesa mug with a personalized saying on it along with the black mesa source logo on in. The company denied my money saying the logo was copywrite. I was like “but um… I am on the actual development team… it is kinda MY logo… now gimme my damn mug!”</p>
<p>They never replied. Christmas last year sucked as a result.</p>

            <p>you’re <span class="bbcode-i">supposed</span> to get into legal trouble for that.</p>
<p>but you can find about 300 different cafepress/zazzle/ebay shops doing exactly what you’re thinking, and for profit</p>

            <p>It’s only if you’re selling it that you should be wary. You could get sued big time if you produce them for sale.</p>

            <p>If you’re making it to wear yourself (which is what I think you mean?) there’s no copyright violation. This applies to anything.</p>
