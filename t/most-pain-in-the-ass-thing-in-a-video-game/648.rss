    <title>Most Pain in the ass thing in a video game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/most-pain-in-the-ass-thing-in-a-video-game/648</link>
    <description>Post your thoughts on an enemy/obstacle/any other problem you&#39;ve encountered in a video game  that completely pissed you off.

For me, it has to be the completely overpowered calvalry units in Medieval II: Total War. Units like the Royal Banderium or Qappalulu are almost impossible to kill unless you manage to hit them with a cannon. Which you won&#39;t, since the accuracy of cannons is shit. &gt; :frowning:</description>

<p>I know they were on the left hand side first. That’s when I first played it. I just didn’t know why. I always assumed it was because that way you could see the bolt moving and it would look cooler.</p>
<p>But I still blame the lazy modelers. They should’ve made new ones for right handed configuration. :meh:</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><span class="bbcode-b">N</span> - That whole fucking game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Psychonauts</span> - The Meat Circus level to an extend. Also, finding the last figment in The Milkman Conspiracy was-- no, <span class="bbcode-i">finding information on the internet about finding the last figment in The Milkman Conspiracy</span> was goddamn annoying.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Diablo 2</span> - Barbarian. Whirlwind. Oblivion Mages. Iron Maiden curse. <span class="bbcode-i">FFFFFFUUUUUUU–</span> Also, the undead exploding flayers in Act III.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Assassin’s Creed</span> - The part near the very end of the game when you <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">literally</span></span> had to fight over <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">twenty</span></span> templars to kill that bald fuck. I ended up spending 60% of that fight running in circles, waiting for my sync bar to go over three blocks. But then the ending comes allright, and then you decide to replay it, and then OH GOD THESE CUTSCENES ARE UNSKIPPABLE WHAT IS THIS I DON’T EVEN</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Dead Space</span> - The Hunter on Impossible difficulty. I’m currently stuck on the part when you’re in a small room you can’t escape from, with him, <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> about 4 Female (acid spitting) Slashers. And a couple of Lurkers (babies) too. One hit from the Hunter brings you to one health bar, two acid spits in your face and you’re a goner, shit’s a clusterfuck and you don’t even have time to turn back and shoot from running for your life, let alone figure out how the hell you’re supposed to get out. GOOD TIMES!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Titan Quest</span> - Now Titan Quest’s all fine and dandy, but once you get to the expansion world, Hades, Immortal Throne being the name of the expansion IIRC, you notice that the devs decided that what this expansion needed was a sudden bump in difficulty. And that doesn’t mean the enemies become more resilient or increase in numbers. All ranged enemies just suddenly start dealing a FUCK. LOAD. OF. DAMAGE. As in, A WHOLE FUCKING LOT, SON. Yeah, couple that with Legendary difficulty (the highest one) and you’re pretty much fucked.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Devil May Cry 4</span> - <span class="bbcode-i">“Jumping puzzles - fine. Timed jumping puzzles - fair enough. Timed jumping puzzles with fixed cameras - now we’ve dropped into the ocean of shittiness. But then they hit us with timed jumping puzzle with a fixed camera where enemies spawn in every time you fail, and now the ocean of shittiness has closed in over our heads with no rescue boat insides.”</span> - Yahtzee</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Prototype</span> - I’ve been actually enjoying it so far. I’m halfway through the story missions, and everything is going pretty nice, I’m sure it will stay that way. :retard:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Braid</span> - I swear I had to use outright glitching to my advantage, just to get past one or two select puzzles. Plus, the moment when I found about the stars. REALLY? DO <span class="bbcode-i">THAT</span>? <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">REALLY??</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">GRAW</span> - As a previous poster mentioned; view <span class="bbcode-b">N</span> above.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Silent Hill 2</span> - PAERAMED HAED IS OVARPOWAERD!!1 OK, OK, that’s just bitching but I’ve ran out of games that I can think of at the top of my mind. And I can’t exactly think when I haven’t slept for a day. (But since I brought this up, some <span class="bbcode-b">Silent Hill 1</span> puzzles were a real bitch. OK, OK, I’m done.)</p>
<p>To be noted: I’d also like to state that building your Protoss army was a major pain in the ass. It almost seemed as if you had to construct additional pylons just to continue production.[/SIZE]</p>

<p>Well, there’s realism and there’s believability. Surprisingly two completely different things.</p>
<p>So what if my villains have outlines, why the fuck would they essentially rig their own base with C4?</p>
