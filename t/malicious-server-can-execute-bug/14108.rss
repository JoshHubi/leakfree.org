    <title>Malicious SERVER_CAN_EXECUTE Bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/malicious-server-can-execute-bug/14108</link>
    <description>None of the current servers are exploiting this at the moment, however, multiplayer servers using third party plugins such as SourceMod or maps using point_clientcommand have the potential to execute any command from the server onto the client. (I think)

This is supposedly caused by the concommand flag SERVER_CAN_EXECUTE not appearing to function correctly. Meaning, servers can fire malicious client commands onto the player, which the whitelist concommand flag SERVER_CAN_EXECUTE, allowed only certain commands to be executed in the rest of the Source multiplayer games. I&#39;ve tested this with SourceMod as well as the point_clientcommand entity.

I hope this gets resolved soon, I really don&#39;t want to see &quot;slow-hacking&quot; become a problem again. Thank you.</description>
