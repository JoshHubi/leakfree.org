    <title>The way the scientist says &quot;...climb up and start the rotors...&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-way-the-scientist-says-climb-up-and-start-the-rotors/11446</link>
    <description>It sounds so similar to the original, it almost seems like a carbon copy. If you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, it&#39;s the tidbit where you first step into the test chamber where things are about to fudge up, a scientist with a deeper voice says &quot;If you would be so good as to climb up and start the rotors...&quot; continued by the rest of the dialogue.

The particular part where he says the word &quot;rotors&quot; sounds pretty much exactly the same as the original HL where the scientist also says it, or at least to me, it does.</description>
