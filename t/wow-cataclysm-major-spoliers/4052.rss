            <p>i am not sure but i think i read somewhere that the old models do get updated to look alot better because…well yeah what you said brokenfridge they need updating.</p>
<p>wow wazad, a bit extreme? there not making a whole new game their trying to revamp the old vannila wow back again so people can revisit that type of wow, dont be so judgemental before a game hasnt even come out, really its prob best that images dont get shown because people build judgements quickly <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> you could have gave me your gold i would of been happy to take  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  lol</p>

<p>Man that was stupid, you could of totally sold your old characters for real money to some lazy player who can’t be bothered grinding all the way to 80, then raiding for weeks to get epic gear.<br>
Also I agree that the older player models are in desperate need of an update, because they’re going to look like a joke next to the Goblin and Worgens. I read somewhere that a Northrend mailbox has a higher polycount then some of the old race models. Think about that for a second. And the female Worgen has 22 different hairstyles to choose from, so it really wouldn’t hurt to update the older races with higher polycount and texture, and more customisation options.<br>
I haven’t played since the start of the year, but seeing <a href="https://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/cataclysm-zones-screenshots-npc-models/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">all these new leaked screenshots</a>, I will probably give in to the money machine again and renew my sub just to check out all the new shit they’re adding to this xpac. And they’re certainly not gimping us out with this one.</p>

            <p>Actually, complaints have been heard by Blizzard and they are going back to classic on a few items in cataclysm. Like, the old pvp system will be back.</p>
<p>I aggree that WoW changed, but I don’t find it worse, it just became a different game. Roleplaying got killed by the dungeonsystems and the ability to get a race, faction, name and looks change. But thats not too big of a problem…</p>
<p>As for cataclysm, I’m gonna love it, major changes for my huntard. And yeah, I care about Deathwing, <a href="https://www.wowwiki.com/Deathwing" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">lore-wise</a>.</p>

            <p>I was level 40 something and near the Goblin desert place or something. I remember fighting giant ants as an owl but thats about it. I don’t even know if I still have my password. But I do hope this is going to make it worth coming back, as I said earlier.</p>

            <p>am glad you replied to his post like that^  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . Obviously i still play wow, but yeah gets boring but the expansions are worth it once i get to highest lvl and finnish everything ill cancel my account and wait for the next one  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> , i am hoping that catacalysm means i wont have to cancel my account as soon as its finnished though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> , looks like their will be lots to explore.</p>
<p>i dont care what blizzard say although they dont want it to be WOW 2.0 it is that no questions asked (which is a good thing) going from 1-60 with wotlk style fun interactive quests sound very interesting and i am sure ill have fun going from lvl 1 with a goblin and their awsome city and tech  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I quit playing WoW in December when it started to get obvious that I couldn’t free the time to raid. And let’s be fair, the only thing to do right in WoW when you’re at the maximum level is either raid or do arenas. And since I couldn’t raid anymore, and PvP only manages to amuse me for short stretches of time, I figured it’s not worth the money anymore.</p>
<p>When Cataclysm comes out, I’ll pick it up and play until I get to the point where the only thing to do is raid and/or PvP and then quit again.</p>
<p>I’ve always liked WoW and will play every expansion/sequel that comes out for it, but due to real life, I can’t/don’t want to get caught up in endgame. Blizzard should add more solo-content at the end. Like solo dungeons and what not where you can test your own skills rather than the combined skill of 2-3-5-10-25 people.</p>

<p>apparently WoW will also be going under a complete graphic overhaul later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As far as I know, Blizzard wants to update the graphics a bit (but remain on the same engine), but it’s not on their big-to-do-before-<em>date</em>-list. We got dynamic shadows and now we’re getting some fancier water, but I doubt we’ll see a big graphics upgrade soon/this year/following year. Which makes me sad, because the old races are to the Worgen/Goblins as a paper plane is to a spaceshuttle.</p>

<p>Blizzad already said that they have a system in place where you’ll get a buff that allows you to move as if you’re walking/running/jumping/turning/strafing under water on the bottom, and when you jump off, you’ll swim (read: fly) under water. Additionaly there’ll be watermounts to make swimming less of a drag.</p>

<p>They aren’t “suddenly appearing” island. The islands they add in Cataclysm have always been there in the Lore, Blizzard just never added them because they had no need for them at the time, or because they had no part in the storylines of that time. Now they do.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve played WoW since the Korean closed beta (huhu hax) and at the time the world was great and perfect and it fit the game at the time. The game has since evolved, quantity and quality went up, the old zones started lagging behind. I absolutely love the idea of the entire old world getting fucked up/changed so -everything- about this expansion is completely new. My only gripe is that some zones didn’t change enough.</p>
<p>Cataclysm feels like a fresh start for WoW. A point where Blizzard can now forget the past and start everything anew. Including the extremely dodgy class balance right now. With the new mastery system, new talents and path of the titans, it looks to me that it will be a lot easier to balance classes, rather than just “if we remove 0.01% modifier on this move, that class will be slightly more balanced against that class, but it’ll be extremely gimped versus that class…”</p>

<p>I quit WoW 1 Year ago. Last week i got 1 month refferal award because i invited a friend and thought “Hey … maybe i will play this again. Makes me fun again” … but now, after i saw all this “new good stuff” : <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Definitly NOT</span></span>!</p>

<p>Also, I’ve been sitting at lvl 70 for around 2 months. This may give me the determination to finally get up to 80 and wait for the expansion to come out.</p>

            <p>I like how they’ve changed the zones, makes you realise how much work they’re actually putting in to this. And yes, it is a moneydrain. I haven’t played for months but this is making me turn over to the dark side again.</p>
