Make a portal in my home, go to a bank and make a portal underneath a safe and then quickly do a portal under me so I get home. Then I&#39;m rich.</description>

            <p>Actually, new theory regarding the compactor:</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Height on exit proportional to distance between portals when portals were originally created/connected.<br>
Okay technically this means if you fall through it infinitely and it’s been vertically offset by a little bit, you will keep getting shorter and shorter or taller and taller with each vertical pass. YOU would be feel normal, but your matter’s dimensions would simply be altered. So the world would seem the opposite warp to you.</p>

<p>What would happen if you were to put a two portals in a vertical trash compactor ceiling to floor, jump in starting the portal loop and then get someone to turn it on?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If the portals didn’t close when the surface they were on moved like in the game, you’d fall endlessly, but the distance between the top of you and the bottom would get gradually smaller. Eventually, your head would get shoved so far up your ass that you’d just explode, but you’d still be getting compressed. You’d be flat as paper, and the top half of you would be pressing on the the bottom half through the portal. This would put your weight x ∞ on you because the you above you is also being pushed on by the you above it, so on and so forth, thus compressing you further with yourself. you’d be more crushed than physically possible in our world.</p>
<p>When the compactor started opening again, you’d be a paste of blood, bones, and organs falling from the top portal to the bottom in over and over again.</p>
<p>Not to mention the worst part, the portal gun you were holding would be destroyed.</p>

<p>That’s not valid troll science, because the physics there are legit. The portals, however, are not. If portals existed like that, they’d shield gravitational influence, like a shadow being cast away from Earth.</p>

            <p>That is true, but if the room is sealed off completely, evaporating water wouldn’t matter, it’d condense again eventually.</p>
<p>We need to pointlessly fix all of the problems with that picture.  Damn trolls!<br>
(also, cooling the room would help keep the water in a liquid state)</p>

            <p>Take a trip to Paris or something, make a portal, hide it, come back home, make another portal, and travel the world, all while keeping that one home portal… suck if I hit the wrong trigger… :l</p>
<p>I would try to portal a large cruise liner to a desert  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Use it to travel to places I have lived before.</p>
<p>Might get money…</p>

            <p>I would put one on a car, and one on the inside of the door leading into the cart bay at work to make bringing in carts easier.<br>
That or be like Sersoft and steal a bunch of new DS games from gamestop all while appearing to browse their meager PC game collection. :3</p>

            <p>Clearly, tone it down a few notches (to reduce the portal size), then put a portal on the bottom of some panties and the inside fly of some boxers. <span class="bbcode-i">Discrete sex anywhere.</span></p>
<p>But you know what, even if the panties are in some sock drawer, the portal would <span class="bbcode-i">still</span> make a very good “boner-shield”. Or invert the panties over some toilet. Wham, remote-access urinal. The possibilities are <span class="bbcode-i">endless</span> (although I think I’ve just exhausted them).</p>
