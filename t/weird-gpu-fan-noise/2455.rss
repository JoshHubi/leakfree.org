    <title>Weird GPU fan noise</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weird-gpu-fan-noise/2455</link>
    <description>My GPU fan (Radeon 4670) is making really weird noises. It&#39;s like it can&#39;t get up to speed: it speeds up, then slows down, speeds up again, etc. It makes a pretty loud noise in the process.
Can these (kind of built-in) fans simply be replaced? Could the problem be something else?

Some details that might give clues:
I came home after 2 weeks; my machine was on all this time since I connect to it via remote desktop a lot. When I came in my room I immediately noticed this weird noise... Opened it up, noticed the GPU fan acting weird... Then I also noticed my power supply fan not working at all...
I shut the computer down, hoping it cools down or something. Then I couldn&#39;t boot it at all, nothing happened. This happened to me a month or so ago, I couldn&#39;t boot for an entire evening, but it worked the next morning, so I thought, no big deal, it&#39;s not all dead yet.
I finally decided to try my old 250W power supply, and surprise, computer booted fine.
Conclusion: My newer power supply cannot handle long periods of runtime, and is probably toast.
My GPU fan is still making this messed up noise though.
Oh, and I&#39;m monitoring the temperature on the GPU, and it&#39;s fine for now, though I didn&#39;t run any gpu-intensive game yet.

I tried to get the latest Catalyst + drivers, that would allow me to control the fan speed manually to see if the problem is the regulator, or the motor itself. But Catalyst won&#39;t start anymore, it crashes instantly &gt;=(</description>

            <p>I think the fan is really about to die completely lol… temperature has some spikes… underclocked the GPU, that should help  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>The card is still under warranty… Would be better if I just send it back to MSI, than risk voiding the warranty by taking the fan out, right?<br>
Would be about 10$ to ship it, if my estimations are right on Canada Post’s website… hmm… I guess whatever I would need to attempt a repair would cost at least as much  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Oh… since it’s entirely possible to control a DC motor with 2 wires, I thought it was controlled  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
That clears things up a bit…</p>

            <p>You can clearly see in that pic there’s only 2 wires going from the card to the fan, if that’s the case for you, then there’s no doubt that the fan speed is not controlled or controllable, it’s constant. The 3rd wire is usually what’s used to make the adjustment and read the fan speed.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>hmmmm… I completely uninstalled catalyst and the drivers, then reinstalled the latest version, and Catalyst works… and the fan seems to be a bit better. But it’s still way more noisy than it should be. With the fan speed controlled manually via catalyst, it didn’t seem like I was actually controlling anything, the speed seemed pretty constant.</p>

            <p>Is it a reference design 4670 or does it have a 3rd party cooler. When i first got my 4890s they were non-reference ones by saphire, the vapor-X series to be specific, and i had to RMA them cause the fan was making weird sounds. Replacing the Saphire ones with two refernce design Xtreme 4890s by XFX fixed the problem.</p>

            <p>My other one was 400W</p>
<p>After buying it, I went on some of these ‘calculate PSU requirements’ sites, and it turned out my 250W would have been enough. But yeah… this solution is temporary I guess. Next upgrade on my computer will most likely be a case+power supply+motherboard+cpu combo (basically a new computer  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  ), so I think I’m gonna wait before getting a power supply.</p>

            <p>You’re running a 4670 on a 250watt supply now?<br>
Because since it seemed your other supply was toast, it could have to do with that it doesn’t get enough power.<br>
I’d recommend getting a new power supply that’s atleast 400watt.</p>

            <p>My GPU fan (Radeon 4670) is making really weird noises. It’s like it can’t get up to speed: it speeds up, then slows down, speeds up again, etc. It makes a pretty loud noise in the process.<br>
Can these (kind of built-in) fans simply be replaced? Could the problem be something else?</p>
<p>Some details that might give clues:<br>
I came home after 2 weeks; my machine was on all this time since I connect to it via remote desktop a lot. When I came in my room I immediately noticed this weird noise… Opened it up, noticed the GPU fan acting weird… Then I also noticed my power supply fan not working at all…<br>
I shut the computer down, hoping it cools down or something. Then I couldn’t boot it at all, nothing happened. This happened to me a month or so ago, I couldn’t boot for an entire evening, but it worked the next morning, so I thought, no big deal, it’s not all dead yet.<br>
I finally decided to try my old 250W power supply, and surprise, computer booted fine.<br>
Conclusion: My newer power supply cannot handle long periods of runtime, and is probably toast.<br>
My GPU fan is still making this messed up noise though.<br>
Oh, and I’m monitoring the temperature on the GPU, and it’s fine for now, though I didn’t run any gpu-intensive game yet.</p>
<p>I tried to get the latest Catalyst + drivers, that would allow me to control the fan speed manually to see if the problem is the regulator, or the motor itself. But Catalyst won’t start anymore, it crashes instantly &gt;=(</p>
