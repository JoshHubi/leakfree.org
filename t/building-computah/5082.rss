    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/building-computah/5082</link>
    <description>I&#39;m building a new machine; I already ordered a couple of parts. I&#39;d like to know what you guys think, if I messed up something, and I might have a few concerns about some things.
I&#39;m a gamer, but not a hardcore one. I multitask a lot (enough to feel that my current dual core is slowing me down), and I was looking to build something for around 600$, by reusing some stuff from current machine that I upgraded (and I&#39;ll put back the older stuff I replaced in it).
This is my first build from ground up; I upgraded plenty of components to my current and previous machines, but this is the first time I buy an empty case.

[i]Note: prices are in canadian dollars[/i]

So far:

* Arrived

[*][b]Hard Drive[/b]
[url=https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136284]1TB Western Digital Caviar Black[/url] (~100$)
[i][u]OR[/u][/i]
1.5TB Western Digital Caviar Green (~100$)
Long story short: I have these 2 drives, and I&#39;m using the 1TB on my current machine while I RMA the 1.5TB, still not sure if I&#39;ll swap them to use the caviar black in the new one. My Caviar Green messed up, so I might have the impression it has lower performances, but it&#39;s probably just me.
* [b]Case[/b]
[url=https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811154098]APEX Vortex 3620 Mid tower[/url] (33.59$)

[url=https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231193]G.SKILL 2 x 2GB DDR3 1600[/url]

Got both the motherboard and RAM for 208$ tax+shipping included. Newegg had a deal with the motherboard at 113$ instead of 170$ + free shipping, and 20$ off the combo with the RAM.
[/*:m]
[*]Not bought yet

* [b]CPU[/b]
With the motherboard I got, I&#39;m obviously going for some AMD CPU... and I gotta say the [url=https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103851]Phenom II X6 1055T[/url] is quite tempting... (227$ current newegg price w/ tax+shipping)
* [b]Power supply[/b]
Tigerdirect sells some Ultra power supplies that have a lifetime warranty if you register them... this sounds like a good argument to me. Was thinking to go for either [url=https://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3276574&amp;Sku=ULT-LSP550]550[/url] or [url=https://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3276573&amp;Sku=ULT-LSP650]650[/url] watts. (55-65$ + tax/shipping)
* [b]DVD Drive[/b]
I&#39;ll just get a cheap one for around 20$. I&#39;ll probably wait for a &#39;free shipping&#39; deal on newegg for this.
[/*:m]
[*]Reusing from current PC

* [b]GPU[/b]
Radeon 4670, unless the onboard chipset turns out to outperform it :meh:
This will definitely be weakest link, but I&#39;ll upgrade it later on... Probably when I get a larger monitor for a dual monitor setup too. (0$ :3 )

Was planning to reuse my current 2GB RAM as well, but that combo deal on newegg changed my mind  :stuck_out_tongue: 
[/*:m][/list:u]

Approx. total cost: 630-650$ shipping and tax included
That is, if I get a X6 CPU... I could save a lot with something a notch under this, but... not sure if I can resist :jizz:.

So for the moment I&#39;m just lurking on newegg and tigerdirect, waiting for deals to come out... Know any other good online store that works in Canada?

A concern:
I&#39;ll need to update the BIOS on the motherboard for it to support a X6 CPU... Is this easy to do with a CD or USB thumb drive? If I had another AMD CPU I could pop it in, boot windows, and do the update the easy way, but I won&#39;t be able to do this.

Any comments appreciated :retard:</description>

</aside>
<p>this.<br>
the chipset is rather old and more of a renamed 780a or 680a.<br>
Those chipsets get really warm, even with active cooling.<br>
Better buy mainboards with AMD Chipset in the case of using an AMD processor, otherwise if you want to do SLI you need a nvidia chipset</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
btw, I bought this:<br>

an MSI 790FX-GD70, a pretty good board, but costs 140€(C$185,9629)</p>

            <p>Well, why don’t you help me and tell me what it is and why “it sucks”?</p>
<p>In the specs I see<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Chipsets</span>:<br>
North bridge: NVIDIA nForce 980a SLI</p>
<p>Onboard Video:<br>
Onboard Video <span class="bbcode-b">Chipset	</span>NVIDIA GeForce 8 series</p>
<p>Onboard Audio:<br>
Audio <span class="bbcode-b">Chipset	</span>Realtek ALC889</p>
<p>I can assume he wasn’t talking about audio, and by elimination I guess it wasn’t about the video chipset either.<br>
Still, I’d like something a little less subjective than ‘it sucks’… Especially since the only thing I know about north/south bridges is that they exist, and that wikipedia article I just read.</p>

<p>The onboard video? I’ll just put in my 4670 in there anyway, I guess… I played most games fine with that GPU</p>

<p>EDIT: you’re BIOS update shouldn’t be a problem, those MSI MBs support flashing from USB sticks, so just load the new BIOS file on the USB stick and plug it in when booting(you maybe need to enable that feature in the BIOS first)</p>

</aside>
<p>Cool<br>
My old mobo was supposed to support that as well, but I never was able to… Not sure if I was doing it wrong, or if the motherboard just sucked. I had the boot order set up and everything, from what I remember…</p>
