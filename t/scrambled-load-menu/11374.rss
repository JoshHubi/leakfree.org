    <title>Scrambled load menu</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/scrambled-load-menu/11374</link>
    <description>Firstly, I&#39;ve done an md5 check, so I know that my Black Mesa archive isn&#39;t incomplete.  Also, I&#39;ve tested this at several resolutions and aspect ratios (I normally run at 1920 x 1080), so it&#39;s not a problem with that, as far as I can tell.

Anyway, one thing I noticed when I booted up Black Mesa a second time, a few days ago, was that my load menu was scrambled, and has stayed that way since (but the other menus, including the new game and save ones, are fine).  The screenshots are clustered in a little scroll-down box in the top left-hand side of the menu, with three listings of &quot;Label&quot; to the right, as you can see here:

I can still load, but this is highly irritating, since it means that I sometimes have to guess if I need to revert to an earlier save for whatever reason.  I&#39;m not sure if anyone else has had this issue, but I haven&#39;t been able to find any other posts on it (although my search might not have been thorough enough).</description>

            <p>It appears that Black Mesa was unable to load the Resource (.res) file from one of the .gcf containers.</p>
<p>I tested this with a blank .res file in Source SDK 2007’s directory - without results; placing the empty file in <span class="bbcode-i">\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS\resource</span>, did have an effect, however (similiar to yours).</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A possible fix for this could be:</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li> Close Black Mesa.</li>
<li> Download the attachment “<span class="bbcode-b">LoadGameDialog.zip</span>”, from this post (<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">virustotal Scan Details</span></span> below).</li>
<li> Un-zip it to a location where the contents are easy to find.</li>
<li> Copy “<span class="bbcode-b">LoadGameDialog.res</span>” (from “[b]…\LoadGameDialog[/b]”) and paste it into this directory: “<span class="bbcode-b">\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS\resource</span>”.</li>
<li> Set the file to “<span class="bbcode-b">Read-Only</span>” (Right-Click on the file -&gt; Click <span class="bbcode-b">Properties</span> -&gt; Check the <span class="bbcode-b">Read-Only</span> checkbox -&gt; Click <span class="bbcode-b">OK</span>).</li>
<li> Start the game and see if it had the desired effect(s)!</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> Replace <span class="bbcode-b"></span> with Steam’s location on your system ([b]D:\Program Files\Steam[/b], for example).</p>

<p>Hope that works!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT (01:11 PM):</span> Just took a screenshot, it doesn’t look exactly like your problem, but it’s close enough:</p>
