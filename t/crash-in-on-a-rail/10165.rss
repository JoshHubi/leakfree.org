    <title>Crash in &quot;On A Rail&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-in-on-a-rail/10165</link>
    <description>I&#39;m getting an engine error in &quot;On A Rail&quot;, after launching the missile and getting on the yellow tram. When I turn on the tram, it goes forward for a bit, hits what I presume to be a loading spot and then crashed with an &quot;Engine Error&quot; message. 

&quot;Engine Error:
Can&#39;t load lump 53, allocation of 17411653 bytes failed!&quot;

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>For me, it crashed no matter what speed I was going. I got around it by starting the tram, getting off, walking forward to load the next map, then jumping back on.</p>

<p>I noticed when I got in the yellow tram it only seemed to crash when going full speed I went through the loading spot slower and was ok. I have included the dump files in case they are of any help. I crashed twice while going full speed and got through fine when I slowed down. If computer specs/environment or other info would be helpful let me know and I will provide them.</p>

<p>Thanks, going slower fixed the glitch.</p>
