    <title>Way to many trolls</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/way-to-many-trolls/1821</link>
    <description>Whats up with people coming on here to bug people.
Can we implement more security? The idea here is that if there is more of a hassle required to join less will join to troll.
Any ideas to stop these people?</description>

            <p>does the title of the thread hasn’t the meaning of “way to ‘dispose of’ many trolls” or something similar?</p>

            <p>My heart says that people are just being intentionally ironic by acting like douchenozzles in a thread about way too many people acting like douchenozzles, but my head says that is sadly not the case.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I didn’t notice the misspelling either because I just read it as right (pronounced “to” as “too”). Guess I’m a moron then. FLAME ON!</p>
<p>Also I like some of the trolling here a lot, but not everything.</p>
<p>And another thing. I was arguing with a guy and was opposing that he stated his opinion as fact, like writing “That is just stupid” instead of writing “I think that is stupid”. Just typing out “I think” or “I feel” or “My thought” can make all the difference. Most of what people say is opinion anyways. A fact can’t be argued. It’s why we call some things fact instead of opinion. It’s why there is a difference in the first place.</p>

<p>and, even more back on topic, I trust the OP wasn’t talking about the likes of Kaze, who might indulge in trolling, but does it in truly epic style (and is therefore tolerated)…</p>

<p>Am I the only one who finds the typo in the topic to be utterly hilarious?</p>
<p>Instead of saying “Way too many trolls” which means “the number of trolls are of a greater number than is desired or acceptable”</p>
<p>it says “Way to many trolls” which means “The direction that leads to a large quantity of trolls”</p>

            <p>Am I the only one who finds the typo in the topic to be utterly hilarious?</p>
<p>Instead of saying “Way too many trolls” which means “the number of trolls are of a greater number than is desired or acceptable”</p>
<p>it says “Way to many trolls” which means “The direction that leads to a large quantity of trolls”</p>
<p>It almost comes across as ironic.</p>

            <p>Trolls on the BMS are irregular and I find them somewhat funny.</p>
<p>You guys are also easy as hell to provoke and when you try to defend your opinions, you don’t make any sense.</p>

            <p>The two work cited link to that quote just gave a short definition and the second one with full page of explanation still didn’t seem too trustworthy to me.</p>
<p>I still don’t like people associate off topic as troll. Sure the off topic come with troll but being off topic alone should not be consider troll. :fffuuu:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Troll (Internet)<br>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
<p>“Do not feed the trolls” and its abbreviation DNFTT redirect here. For the Wikimedia essay, see “What is a troll?”.</p>
<p>In Internet slang, a troll is someone who posts controversial, inflammatory, irrelevant, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum, chat room or blog, with the primary intent of provoking other users into an emotional response[1] or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.[2]</p>

</aside>
<p>Ya’ll SHOULD have a read of that page tho, cuz the “history” is actually quite interesting.  Only cuz I have done it myself enough times and I never realized that I could have been considered trolling.</p>
