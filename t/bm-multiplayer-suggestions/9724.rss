    <description>I very much enjoyed HL1&#39;s death match, especially the XDM Mod.

Fast Paced Death Match with hookshots, power ups, server editable modified gun properties, all guns and jump pack automatically on spawn.

It made the game very intense. Here is a video.

This ^ is very enjoyable and is the reason I still sometimes play HL1 DM yet only about 5 or 6 servers are actively using this mod, but regularly have players in them.</description>

            <p>I am not sure you understood his post. He said “COD-LIKE” I believe all he was asking was for you to better explain and clarify what you were asking for (remember that not everyone knows what Extreme deathmatch (XDM) Is and as you are the one asking the question the burden should be on you to explain it (it isn’t anyone here’s responsibility to Google XDM to figure out what you are talking about).</p>
<p>Try having a bit of patience. Coming back against someone who is trying to help and calling them a troll and a degenerate isn’t going to get you anywhere around here.</p>

<p>What’s your suggestion? If you want hook mod or COD like load-outs, it’s probably not gonna happen. Also take note that the suggestion forum has been removed, so they probably aren’t taking suggestions anymore.</p>

</aside>
<p>ROFL, COD like load outs? Where do you even get COD out of my post? You are a poor poor troll.</p>
<p>I’m not going to repost.</p>
<p>People like you are the degeneration of development communities all across the net. xD</p>
