<p>I guess you haven’t played MP for a few months, if you haven’t noticed that the rubberbanding is gone.</p>

<p>BF4’s campaign does have its moments, sadly not a lot of them. I view it as a way of preparing yourself for multiplayer, once you’ve completed it on hard, you’re ready for the MP.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>the only thing bf4’s SP prepared me for was the god awful rubberbanding and registry that is present in the MP, and SP had forced console-fov (fov was so low and unchangable)<br>
the SP was so linear its almost an insult to the very thing bf is</p>

<p>Something tells me this CoD is gonna be multiplayer only. I don’t think they need so many universes.<br>
And lol @ how they have 3 games planned in advance. Confident much.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>when CoD isnt spending majority of their development budget marketing the MP, they’re doing it marketing the SP (most of the first trailers for a cod game is always about the campaign, including the super bowl ones)</p>
<p>if theres any franchise that doesnt need a SP, its bf3/bf4<br>
DICE should’ve just continued the BC storyline with bf3/bf4, their new storyline is so half-baked as with the rest of the SP</p>
<p>at least CoD manages to make popcorn action-flicks out of their campaigns (alot of their campaigns since cod1 have had many movie references too)</p>

            <p>BF3 is just plain bad and boring. BF4’s is cute in the way it tries to be epic and serious.</p>
<p>Weren’t the Bad Company campaigns kinda decent, tho?</p>

            <p>I haven’t played much of either BF3 or BF4’s campaign, but they didn’t seem too great. The franchise clearly has it’s focus on the multiplayer component.</p>

            <p>Half the CoD series games’ campaigns are decent imho.<br>
CoD1 + United Offensive = blast<br>
CoD 2 = blast<br>
World at War = decent<br>
Black Ops = blast<br>
Black Ops 2 = blast</p>
<p>I haven’t played BF3 or BF4 campaigns yet, are they really <span class="bbcode-b">that</span> bad?</p>
<p>Something tells me this CoD is gonna be multiplayer only. I don’t think they need so many universes.<br>

            <p>On the other hand, there’s a completely new developer involved. No idea who they are, but they’re there.</p>
