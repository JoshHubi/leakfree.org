    <title>New Ep2 mod crashes when NPC added</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-ep2-mod-crashes-when-npc-added/12866</link>
    <description>Hey guys - I&#39;ve been out of modding for a long while with all the crap going on with Valve/Steam/Source etc etc. I thought I&#39;d try redownloading everything and try my hand at a mod again. 

Working off the 2013 files (hammer.exe) I&#39;ve started to build my first level. When I compile and run the game with only me (player) inside it works ok. As soon as I add even one NPC (citizen) the game will crash after a few seconds in game. Take out the NPC...works fine again. Any ideas why this would happen??</description>
