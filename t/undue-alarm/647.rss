    <title>Undue Alarm</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/undue-alarm/647</link>
    <description>I finally learned how to properly use the powerful Source Recorder, so I managed to get some spare time (12 hours) and film something very short.

The actual recording in game took about 2 hours (included the time when I recorded, and when I replayed &amp; video captured it) and the post processing took 10 hours.
If you don&#39;t recognize that awesome music, gtfo  :smiley: 

The reason I posted it here is because I need to hear from you what does this movie miss, or something that needs to be kicked out. I&#39;m planing something bigger this month, so ideas will be appreciated.

            <p>It’s a lot better than what you end up seeing in-game. The music was nice, but I don’t recognize it so unfortunately I must leave.</p>
