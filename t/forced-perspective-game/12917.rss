    <description>Hey, there&#39;s this neat [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOfll06X16c&#39;]tech demo[/url] for a forced perspective first-person puzzle game that looks very cool.  Wonder if this is going to be what Narbacular Drop did for Portal...</description>

            <p>Every time I replay Prey I regret it. The movement sucked, the weapons felt underpowered, the characters were annoying, more than a few of the puzzles were irritating, the level design was beautiful, but the flow of them was terrible. I hated Prey.</p>

            <p>this renderer is fairly simple, no special effect or anything, so it’s fairly easy to render the scene a bunch of times without punching the performance to the ground.<br>
Btw, the reflections in HL2 were rendered in full resolution and that game is from 2004. Now a days you just have the problem with deferred rendering as you get a super fat geometry buffer(the texture buffer that stores all the scene info for lighting) which makes it hard to have multiple of them without getting out of texture memory(not so much nowadays with 3GB+ VRAM).</p>
<p>Render Targets are getting rendered to every frame anyway, as the perspective constantly changes and there are also some moving objects, so you can’t just stop rendering to it and making it a static texture.</p>
<p>btw, what I just notice: you can’t use this game with a more advanced lighting system as the lighting and especially shadows would break the illusion, let’s see what they come up with to circumvent that issue.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>If it’s moving though you would need to render more because what is being rendered is constantly changing. That’s the way it seems to me though, I could be wrong. Also the fact that it’s full res, while most reflections (which this is probably using the same tech) in games these days are something like half res or even lower. If it’s not because of that I don’t see any reason why the portal should shut off while being moved.</p>

            <p>doubt it, render targets cost the same, no matter if they’re applied to a moving or static object.</p>

            <p>It’s most likely to save processing power. Having to render a moving extra render of the environment, especially since it looks full res, could be pretty intensive.</p>
<p>This thing does look pretty cool. Is it available to download right now?</p>

<p>I’m the one wondering about the resized-portals.  If you keep walking through the resized-portals over and over again, will you eventually become so “tiny” that you break the game? I’d love to test that out.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m thinking you’d just get so small that simply getting back to the other portal would just take an eternity.</p>

            <p>Prey did some of those multiple sized portals almost exactly like that.</p>

            <p>I saw a tech demo where someone made those resizable portals eons ago. It was on youtube right when portal came out. This guy was making a clone and expanded the idea to astronomical proportions. Didn’t go anywhere.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the same guy and it did go somewhere?</p>

            <p>I really hope this becomes a real game. This looks so much fun to play with.</p>
