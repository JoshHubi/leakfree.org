<p>No. First of all, Easter came from Jewish Passover.</p>
<p>Second, Easter was also the day ancient people celebrated Spring equinox as a “feast of fertility” (when they worshiped the gods of fertility), and that is the reason for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_bunny" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Eastern bunny</a> as a symbol of the celebration.</p>
<p>The name <span class="bbcode-i">Easter</span> comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%92ostre" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Old English <span class="bbcode-i">Eostre</span></a> which is the name of a Germanic goddess of fertility.</p>

            <p>Up to, like, some 5 years ago I honestly had no idea Easter was religion-related.</p>
<p>Anyway, we colored some eggs, hid them in the garden and then sent my sister’s kid to look for them. I don’t really know how that turned out cause I was still asleep at the time.</p>

<p>I seriously wish I could do that but my relatives agreed to have the party at my house. I just hope that my cousin (we nicknamed “The Devil’s Child”) Doesn’t hit my other cousin with a 9 Iron again and then a Plastic Bat. Zombie Jesus Day is stressful.</p>
