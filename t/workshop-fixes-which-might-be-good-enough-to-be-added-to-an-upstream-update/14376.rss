    <title>Workshop fixes which might be good enough to be added to an upstream update</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/workshop-fixes-which-might-be-good-enough-to-be-added-to-an-upstream-update/14376</link>
    <description>There are some nice and often very small but effective fixes available through the Steam Workshop which in my opinion are good enough to be added to an upstream update:

[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482087356&#39;]Tripmine Aquiring Sound Fix[/url]
[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470070900&#39;]No Sprint Sound - removes the sprint sound, which is very annoying with alyways sprint enabled. Another idea would be to disable this sound only when always sprinting is enabled.[/url]
[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487703152&#39;]Emergency Flare Texture Edit/Fix[/url]
[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=493034539&#39;]Scientist Shirt Retexture[/url]
[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482285127&#39;]Weapons Sound Sync Fix[/url]
[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=500659209&#39;]Hivehand Acquisition Fix (what many players have been waiting for a while)[/url]
[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=500724252&#39;]Blast Pit Lighting Fix[/url]
[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=501700003&#39;]Lambda Core Teleport lighting fix[/url]</description>

<p>Well, at least the tripmine thing is actually a fix, since it’s just a problem with the sound being kinda confusing to many players.<br>
It’s good to hear you’re aware of these issues and trying to fix them.  :thumbup:<br>
But at least for the hivehand issue I think a temporary workaround solution like the one from the workshop is still better than being forced to lookup some “hacky” give commands or to play the game without the hivehand at all.</p>

<p>To be fair, at least he didn’t post links to all the “original placement restored” mods that have overrun the workshop.</p>
