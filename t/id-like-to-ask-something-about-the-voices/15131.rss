    <description>I&#39;d like to ask something about the voices:

I&#39;d like to ask is there any chance to change some dialogues to other with another voice?
I find funny almost every Black Mesa guards have the same voice and the scientists haven&#39;t got many voice actors either.
Do you think about to create some other new dialogues too for the soldiers etc..
I&#39;d like to volunteer to make some dialogues.</description>

            <p>I doubt that even when it is “done” that the dev team will ever fully be “done” with the game. These cats are passionate about their baby.</p>

            <p>Besides, people are free to mod their game as they please. That’s what the Steam Workshop is for.</p>
<p>By the way, seeing as a you’re already here, I would like to ask whether there are there any plans to ever revisit/ touch up the earthbound chapters after Xen to some - any - degree. I know that Black Mesa is Crowbar Collective’s last and only game as Crowbar Collective, but can we expect limited support for Black Mesa after its full release? It’s just that on some occasions in particular there can be quite a big disconnect in visual fidelity between chapters of the game. Don’t get me wrong, godrays, CSM and all the other engine improvements did wonders for the earthbound chapters, but compared to what we’ve seen of Xen - they’re hardly in the same league.</p>
<p>I am aware that this is just what happens when a game has been in development for well over a decade, and initially started as a volunteer project before eventually going retail, but I just figured like asking anyway. Either way, I’m looking forward to Xen, and I wish you people the best of luck in your future careers when all is said and done!</p>

            <p>So, here’s the thing… Victoria’s the nice one in the group.</p>
<p>Whereas I …</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DKUR9Tk.png" alt="" width="365" height="277"></p>
<p>We have no plans whatsoever to put additional human voices into the game.</p>
<p>That would require time and resources, most of which are pointed now at Xen’s development.  Quite frankly… we want to get Xen done, and any desires beyond that goal are secondary at this point.</p>
<p>There may be some small fixes to the Earthbound gameplay along the way (if time permits), but additional human voices are not being looked at.</p>
<p>Plus, you know… pretty sure we’d have to pay[/size] for any such new work to avoid legal troubles, should it be placed into the actual steam build.</p>

            <p>If the makers of the Black Mesa want to pay for the voices… means they have a lot of money to waste!<br>

<p>He asked a question. No reason to get all passive aggressive. Jesus…<br>
That being said, you’re right, it’s most definitely not gonna happen. Besides, it’s not like Half-Life 2 had a bunch of different voice actors either (apart from the reoccurring characters that Black Mesa obviously lacks)</p>

<p>I’d like to ask something about the voices:</p>
<p>I’d like to ask is there any chance to change some dialogues to other with another voice?<br>
I find funny almost every Black Mesa guards have the same voice and the scientists haven’t got many voice actors either.<br>
Do you think about to create some other new dialogues too for the soldiers etc…<br>
I’d like to volunteer to make some dialogues.</p>
