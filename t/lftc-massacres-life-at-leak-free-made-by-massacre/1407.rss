    <title>LFTC: MassaCre&#39;s Life at Leak-Free (Made by MassaCre)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lftc-massacres-life-at-leak-free-made-by-massacre/1407</link>
    <description>Aside from [i]Attack of the Noobs[/i], MassaCre also made numerous short and sweet comics during his tenure at Leak-Free. Rather than make a seperate thread for each and every one of his &quot;MassaCre&#39;s Life at Leak-Free&quot; or &quot;Leakians&quot; shorts, I&#39;ll dump them here whenever I feel like posting one of them. Anyway, the first one up is titled [b][i]Stupid GMod On Wheels[/i][/b]:
