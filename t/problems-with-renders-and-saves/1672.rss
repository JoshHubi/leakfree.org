    <title>Problems with renders and saves</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problems-with-renders-and-saves/1672</link>
    <description>Lately every time I play HL1, I&#39;ve had many problems.  For instance, I&#39;ll double save, and both saves will be corrupt or have issues when I reload the game.  Plus when I load from an autosave, I&#39;ll be completely frozen in place and not even a noclip can move me.  I&#39;ve been having this issues with the level where the black hawk helicopters fire at you, the first time you get to the surface.

Also, if anyone knows of a renderer I could add, since the ones that come with it let me run in 1280 x 1024 and 24bit, OR 1024 x 768 and 32 bit.  Not to mention a few crash anyways.  &gt;.&gt;</description>

<p>I suppose you can always try the standard “shit happens” procedures.</p>
<p>Restart the game.<br>
Check for file integrity.<br>
Delete the game folder (not the GCF).<br>
Delete both the game folder and GCF.</p>
<p>Remember, in doing the last one you’ll lose your saves. They don’t appear to be stored in the game folder itself, so it’s possible that the GCF is modified when you save. Are you using Half-Life or Half-Life: Source?</p>
<p>Also, concerning the renderers, are you talking about the DirectX/OpenGL options? I’m not sure about any alternatives. Running a Google search doesn’t seem to turn up any results, however.</p>
<p>Good luck, sir.</p>
