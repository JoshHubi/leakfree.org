    <title>A couple bugs I spotted in the Xen beta</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-couple-bugs-i-spotted-in-the-xen-beta/62361</link>
    <description>Firstly, this rock geometry in this cave on map bm_c4a1a1 -
at coordinates: setpos 4996.864258 7295.997559 6435.041016;setang 27.419632 97.628738 0.000055 -
Has no collision. Hard to screenshot easily, since it&#39;s underwater. Grabbed a first screenshot of the cave ceiling over the rocks, then a screenshot of what you see if you do a 180 degree turn to look behind you at the end. Did not check rest of cave.
In map bm_c4a1b at coords: setpos -11905.156250 -3471.016602 9509.958008;setang -7.292344 172.354202 0.000000 -
the scaffolding has some missing textures.
Finally, in also map bm_c4a1b at coords: setpos -9348.548828 55.250706 10636.198242;setang 21.571663 -148.749802 0.000000 -
the laptop screen is translucent, you can see the props behind it.

That&#39;s all, I hope I&#39;ve helped. Sorry for having to dump to an imgur album. I had to rewrite this post several times to figure out how to efficiently upload the pictures. Limit on uploads, limit on hyperlinks, etc.</description>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>To continue this thread about bugs, I’ve had a few that weren’t mentioned yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bullsquids are moving quite badly, they kinda “glide” in a slow glitchy way like they are trying to turn but there is not enough room so they vibrate. Also they’re not very aggressive.</li>
<li>HEV zombies are often stuck when you first encounter them.</li>
<li>The sounds are not originating from HEV zombies and Houndeyes location (maybe others too but I forgot)</li>
</ul>
<p>I play on a laptop : ASUS ROG GL502V</p>
<p>Astounding job though, it’s just breathtaking.<br>
Cheers</p>
