    <title>Very minor water graphic annoyance</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/very-minor-water-graphic-annoyance/10243</link>
    <description>This is really minor, and I understand its the fault of the engine, but it would be nice if the areas that you are allowed to walk on, that are slightly submerged in water where shallow enough not to encounter the graphic defect, I made a quick vid (but I was attacked by a bull squid!! lol)

also I must say this mod is amazing dev&#39;s... really is. I would love to donate if I could. Best single player fps I&#39;ve played in a long time!


Edit!- also if you use the glocks secondary fire underwater, it makes a funny noise (also i guess the secondary fire for glock was removed??)</description>
