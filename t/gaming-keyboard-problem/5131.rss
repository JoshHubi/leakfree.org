    <title>Gaming Keyboard problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gaming-keyboard-problem/5131</link>
    <description>Alright, I already did a search on this particular type of keyboard and nothing came up and searching the net did me no good. But I recently got a Steelseries Merc Stealth Keyboard for my birthday. It has gaming presets for games but every time I open one game, it detects another game on the same engine making me use those presets. Like Half life 2 gives me Counter Strike source, and TF2 gives me Half life 2. 

Normally I would submit a ticket to the Steelseries about this problem but I tried like 3 times and always got redirected to something else that didn&#39;t do me any good. I downloaded their latest driver and installed it, I run Windows Vista 64 bit, and I just want this keyboard to work the way it&#39;s supposed to. please help.</description>

            <p>Yeah. My keyboard runs under executables. It’s design was good but it’s execution was…lacking. I’m learning to live with it though.</p>

<p>We’ve already established this, and the G15 does it because it was coded to do so. Why else would it?<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

            <p>It is all saved on the keyboard, or at least those macro buttons. And those keys possibly aren’t recognized as part of the keyboard. AKA, they don’t do anything unless used in a game. At that point, they wont show up as applicable buttons in the keyboards tab. Either way, it’s an unneeded item indeed. But hey, he got it for free, can’t complain.</p>

            <p>Is there a way of turning that feature off then? It’s really unneeded for most games I’d say. When I turn on a game with his cheap old USB Keyboard it loads the setting for that game.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Meaning you have a keyboard that does the same damn thing, but is claiming to have that as a feature that other keyboards don’t, even though it’s all saved in the games files and not on the keyboard…</p>
<p>I’d say that’s unneeded…</p>

<p>So, your problem is that your keyboard uses the same presets for all source games? Isn’t that a good thing?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s not exactly a good thing. Because Half life 2 doesn’t use the same buttons as TF2. The same with Counter Strike Source not using the same buttons as Half life 2. Like I have a button for Suit Zoom in TF2 and Half-life: source. Those buttons aren’t needed.</p>

            <p>yes it does, it says whatever the mod name is, portal = hl2.exe anyway you have to save a shortcut for each game on the desktop (from steam) and check in the target box how they are launched (uaually example C:\Steam\Steam.exe -applaunch 240)</p>
