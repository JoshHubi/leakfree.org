    <title>Enhanced sounds for Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/enhanced-sounds-for-black-mesa/12345</link>
    <description>Hi ! I was bored today and I decided to do this pack of sounds for Black Mesa. 

[b][i]DOWNLOAD SECTION :[/i][/b]
[b][u][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]DOWNLOAD VERSION 1[/u][/b] : [url=&#39;https://www.mediafire.com/download/51ab9gzmpccvygu/Hecu_Marine&#39;s_sound_v1.rar&#39;]CLICK HERE[/url] 

[b][u][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]DOWNLOAD VERSION 2[/u][/b] : [url=&#39;https://www.mediafire.com/download/t3mt7aw9duuge9i/Hecu_Marine&#39;s_sound_v2.rar&#39;]CLICK HERE[/url] ( Version 2 contains everything from V1 plus new content )

[b][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;][u]DOWNLOAD VERSION 3[/u][/b] : [url=&#39;https://www.mediafire.com/download/srt4t6lb47mt03w/Hecu_Marine&#39;s_sound_v3.rar&#39;]CLICK HERE[/url] ( Version 3 contains everything from V1 and V2 plus new content )

[b][i]VIDEO SECTION : 
[/i][/b][url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJCC-KTpiFk&#39;]CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO OF VERSION 1[/url]
[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2TQlgXVzQ&#39;]CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO OF VERSION 3[/url]

[b][i]CHANGELOG :[/i][/b]
Here is what I did for now :

gun_far 1,2,3,4 - these are sounds heard in questionable ethics, but originally they
are barely hearable. In fact I didn&#39;t hear them at all ! So now I changed them and made 
them louder so you can hear soldiers killing scientists in QE corridors.

scream_far 1,2,3 - another sounds from Questionable Ethics. They are also heard in 
corridors. I made them louder so they should be heard now clearly.

soundscape_boom 1,2 - It&#39;s the best in this pack. It&#39;s ambient of outside battles in 
&quot;surface tension&quot; chapter. Originally they are one second quiet boom. I changed them 
into gunshots, explosions etc.

soundscape_indoorboom1,2,3,4,5,6,7 - Quiet explosions heard in game. Now they are loud 
so you can feel impact of levels such as forget about freeman.

alarms - changed few of them

vo(c1a1b,c1a2a) - here are suspense sounds I added. They are mixed with npc dialogue but 
in scenes when you don&#39;t see their poses so faceposer is not messed up.

weapons - I changed sound effects of three weapons.

EDIT : V2 changes
alien grunt step1,2,3,4,5 etc. - When alien grunt walks, he wears armor on his feet. Now you can hear metalic footsteps from it !
apache and osprey rotors - changed the sound effect of it
mscl_ambience - changed one into suspense from hl1 when you meet first alien grunt in QE like it was in HL1.
comeincooper and faf radio - now you can hear battle sound effects in the background

EDIT : V3 changes 
new suspense in apprehension when a guard is killed by assassin like it was in original HL 1
houndeye;blast1 - It&#39;s the same sound from original BMS but with sonic damage effect at the end
tentacle;tent_strike1g - I changed tentacle sound when it strike metal parts of floor
zombie - changed every sound to those in HL2 to make it similar to next games
scream_far 1,2,3 - increased volume because they were not heard very well. Now they are.
soundscape_farchopper1,2 - increased volume because I didn&#39;t hear them in game
mp5_shot,burst,single - increased volume 
soundscaoe_gunfire1 - increased volume

You can read more in readme. Have fun !</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <ul>
<li>Scientists shot by marines in QE corridor could be even more louder</li>
<li>Make tentacle sounds more HL1-like (for example dying sound, and their roars should be louder and more high-pitched)</li>
<li>bullsquid sounds should also be louder, I rarely even hear him in the game</li>

<p>I have a suggestion: make ichthyosaur’s sounds louder because I didn’t hear them at all when fighting it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Okay I will include it in V4. I’m still gathering ideas for my list and unless I have enough I can’t release V4. If somebody got more ideas please tell me.</p>

<p>Hmm. I think I will leave it as it is. Not because I say you’re wrong, but I enjoy it the way it is so I won’t touch it. Still might consider changing in V3. The battle sound you shown in youtube link is very good, but it’s not free, besides in my opinion it’s too much intense and it sounds like there’s a huge battle nearby but “surface tension” doesn’t offer that huge fights. So I added few gunshots and explosions sounds here and there but not too much.</p>

<p>Hi ! I was bored today and I decided to do this pack of sounds for Black Mesa.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">[COLOR=‘Red’]DOWNLOAD VERSION 1</span></span> : <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/download/51ab9gzmpccvygu/Hecu_Marine's_sound_v1.rar" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">CLICK HERE</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJCC-KTpiFk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO OF VERSION 1</a></p>
<p>Here is what I did for now :</p>
<p>gun_far 1,2,3,4 - these are sounds heard in questionable ethics, but originally they<br>
are barely hearable. In fact I didn’t hear them at all ! So now I changed them and made<br>
them louder so you can hear soldiers killing scientists in QE corridors.</p>
<p>scream_far 1,2,3 - another sounds from Questionable Ethics. They are also heard in<br>

<p>soundscape_indoorboom1,2,3,4,5,6,7 - Quiet explosions heard in game. Now they are loud<br>

<p>weapons - I changed sound effects of three weapons.</p>
<p>EDIT : V2 changes<br>
alien grunt step1,2,3,4,5 etc. - When alien grunt walks, he wears armor on his feet. Now you can hear metalic footsteps from it !<br>
apache and osprey rotors - changed the sound effect of it<br>
mscl_ambience - changed one into suspense from hl1 when you meet first alien grunt in QE like it was in HL1.<br>
comeincooper and faf radio - now you can hear battle sound effects in the background</p>
<p>You can read more in readme. Have fun !</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">CHANGELOG :</span></span><br>
Here is what I did for now :</p>
<p>gun_far 1,2,3,4 - these are sounds heard in questionable ethics, but originally they<br>
are barely hearable. In fact I didn’t hear them at all ! So now I changed them and made<br>
them louder so you can hear soldiers killing scientists in QE corridors.</p>
<p>scream_far 1,2,3 - another sounds from Questionable Ethics. They are also heard in<br>
corridors. I made them louder so they should be heard now clearly.</p>
<p>soundscape_boom 1,2 - It’s the best in this pack. It’s ambient of outside battles in<br>
“surface tension” chapter. Originally they are one second quiet boom. I changed them<br>
into gunshots, explosions etc.</p>
<p>soundscape_indoorboom1,2,3,4,5,6,7 - Quiet explosions heard in game. Now they are loud<br>
so you can feel impact of levels such as forget about freeman.</p>
<p>alarms - changed few of them</p>
<p>vo(c1a1b,c1a2a) - here are suspense sounds I added. They are mixed with npc dialogue but<br>
in scenes when you don’t see their poses so faceposer is not messed up.</p>
<p>weapons - I changed sound effects of three weapons.</p>
<p>EDIT : V2 changes<br>
alien grunt step1,2,3,4,5 etc. - When alien grunt walks, he wears armor on his feet. Now you can hear metalic footsteps from it !<br>
apache and osprey rotors - changed the sound effect of it<br>
mscl_ambience - changed one into suspense from hl1 when you meet first alien grunt in QE like it was in HL1.<br>
comeincooper and faf radio - now you can hear battle sound effects in the background</p>
<p>EDIT : V3 changes<br>
new suspense in apprehension when a guard is killed by assassin like it was in original HL 1<br>
houndeye;blast1 - It’s the same sound from original BMS but with sonic damage effect at the end<br>
tentacle;tent_strike1g - I changed tentacle sound when it strike metal parts of floor<br>
zombie - changed every sound to those in HL2 to make it similar to next games<br>
scream_far 1,2,3 - increased volume because they were not heard very well. Now they are.<br>
soundscape_farchopper1,2 - increased volume because I didn’t hear them in game<br>
mp5_shot,burst,single - increased volume<br>
soundscaoe_gunfire1 - increased volume</p>
<p>You can read more in readme. Have fun !</p>
