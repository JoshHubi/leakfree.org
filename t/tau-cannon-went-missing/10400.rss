    <title>Tau Cannon went missing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tau-cannon-went-missing/10400</link>
    <description>After completing Questionable Ethics I realized that I no longer have the Tau Cannon, despite still picking up ammo for it (The little radiation boxes I assume?).  Does the gun go missing once you hit Surface Tension?

edit: If I impulse 101 I have the gun and it is definitely the ammo for it that I am talking about.  Why would the gun go missing? bug?</description>

            <p>Cant load back without playing through all of questionable ethics as I forgot to save apparently (Pretty sure I did save…not sure whats up with that).  Just gave myself the weapon and called it a day.</p>

            <p>It’s probably a bug. Try reloading a save, or adding weapon by console. It should be something like</p>
<p>give weapon_tau</p>
