    <title>Alien Reboot or Origin Story Being Considered.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/alien-reboot-or-origin-story-being-considered/438</link>
    <description>Alright, I suppose it&#39;s time for me to accept the fact that like it or not, Hollywood considers nothing sacred when it comes to &quot;reboots, remakes, etc&quot;, so instead of being instantly pessimistic whenever I see one of my most beloved movies/franchises being considered for the Joan Rivers treatment, I&#39;ll hope they actually make her look human...  Er, hope they actually do the original some justice.

That said, I can&#39;t help but be a little skittish in regards to the Alien franchise, as it&#39;s one that has not had the most luck when it comes to the decisions of studio execs (probably the fact that Fox owns it really doesn&#39;t help).

Here&#39;s the article by which I discovered this news, Latinoreview is an excellent site that tends to get the most reliable information about the goings on in Hollywood in the movies department, in fact most of the bigger i-mags tend to cite this site.

My personal casting choice for Ellen Ripley would really have to go to Torri Higginson, best known as Dr. Elizabeth Weir on Stargate Atlantis.  She&#39;s always reminded me of Sigourney and think she would do the role justice.

            <p>I’d rather have a prequel than a remake.  It would be interesting and maybe they could base it off of the comic books that were actually very good.</p>
<p>The original is just…you can’t redo what that one did. People were puking and fainting in the theater during the original chestburster scene. It’s just such a damn good movie.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s in stone, Rinsch and Scott are going ahead with it, filming starts by the end of the year.</p>
<p>There are also some cool shorts that showcase Rinsch’s directorial abilities that actually encourage me to have faith in this origin story (which are also getting too heavily done these days).</p>

<p>I figured thats who you meant. I referred to them as “The Big Guys”</p>
<p>No, it will be more likely how the crew met up in the first place. Something lame like that.</p>

            <p>Hmm, perhaps not, apparently Ridley Scott is all over this, and I know he’s not one to compromise on such things, not to mention there was a definite move away from making a movie kiddie friendly when they did AvP2.</p>
<p>Slight update, as <a href="http://IO9.com" rel="nofollow noopener">IO9.com</a> reports, apparently the next Alien movie will indeed be a prequel.  I really really hope more is revealed about the mysterious Space Jockeys.</p>
<p>Very loose amount of info for this in the article, but the links contained therein have some interesting words from Scott and Rinsch.</p>

            <p>Alright, I suppose it’s time for me to accept the fact that like it or not, Hollywood considers nothing sacred when it comes to “reboots, remakes, etc”, so instead of being instantly pessimistic whenever I see one of my most beloved movies/franchises being considered for the Joan Rivers treatment, I’ll hope they actually make her look human…  Er, hope they actually do the original some justice.</p>
<p>That said, I can’t help but be a little skittish in regards to the Alien franchise, as it’s one that has not had the most luck when it comes to the decisions of studio execs (probably the fact that Fox owns it really doesn’t help).</p>
<p>Here’s the article by which I discovered this news, Latinoreview is an excellent site that tends to get the most reliable information about the goings on in Hollywood in the movies department, in fact most of the bigger i-mags tend to cite this site.</p>

<p>My personal casting choice for Ellen Ripley would really have to go to Torri Higginson, best known as Dr. Elizabeth Weir on Stargate Atlantis.  She’s always reminded me of Sigourney and think she would do the role justice.</p>
