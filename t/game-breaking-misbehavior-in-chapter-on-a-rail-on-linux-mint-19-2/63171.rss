    <title>Game-breaking misbehavior in chapter &quot;On A Rail&quot; on Linux Mint 19.2</title>

    <description>Hi all,

WONDERFUL game! I can&#39;t wait to continue it

I&#39;m having a weird set of issues starting on bm_c2a2b, starting at around -150.7, -896.7, 200.0. As I said in the title, I am on Linux Mint 19.2 x64. What seems to happen is that all keyboard and mouse button control doesn&#39;t work, nor do normal xorg escapes like alt+tab, alt+`, ctrl+q, or anything like that. I have to go into TTY1 to actually exit the game. However, the mouse movement still works. This starts when I go back next to the weapons locker, reload the shotgun, or something like that. 

I sometimes regain control after taking some damage, but I haven&#39;t seen any consistent behavior.</description>
