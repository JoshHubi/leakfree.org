    <title>Opinion: Best TF2 MVM Loadouts</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/opinion-best-tf2-mvm-loadouts/13411</link>
    <description>So I wasn&#39;t really sure where to put this since it really is kinda random (at least to me)

I wanted to know what people think are the best MVM loadouts for TF2. (Prefer opinions that are based on best strategy for something like Mann Up Mode)
Here is my personal opinion:

Scout: Force A&#39; Nature, Mad Milk, Fan O&#39; War

Soldier: Beggar&#39;s Bazooka/Air Strike, Concheror (If using Beggar&#39;s)/B.A.S.E. Jumper (If using Air-Strike), Market Gardener/Escape Plan

Pyro: stock Flamethrower, Scorch Shot, Homewrecker

Demoman: stock Grenade Launcher, Scottish Resistance, Ullapool Caper

Heavy: Brass Beast, Sandvich, Gloves of Running Urgently

Engineer: Rescue Ranger, Wrangler, Jag

Medic: Overdose, Kritzkrieg, Vita-Saw/Amputator 

Sniper: Machina, Jarate, Tribalman&#39;s Shiv

Spy: Enforcer/Ambassador, Spycicle, Dead Ringer, stock Sapper</description>

            <p>I just used whatever seemed like it would be fun. That righteous bison is pretty fun with upgrades. It’s also fun to upgrade your wrench swing speed and repair a sentry faster than they can damage it.</p>
