    <title>Blank screen</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blank-screen/15037</link>
    <description>Hi, hoping someone can help. When I&#39;m playing the game, it runs great. However when I try to minimise, the monitor goes blank and even Ctrl+alt+del won&#39;t work. Same thing happened when I was in the video settings the game seemed to crash when I was trying to change anything.

I thought I&#39;d try in window mode, I tried to change to window mode in game and the same thing happened, the screen went blank. I could still hear the game as if it was running but the monitor went blank and I can&#39;t minimise or end task when this happens.

When this happens I have to force my PC to restart which I don&#39;t want to keep doing.

Even simply quitting the game causes the screen to go blank, then I can&#39;t get back to windows or task manager.

            <p>The way for all source games to be alt-tab friendly:<br>
in the launch options for the game, type:<br>
-window -noborder -console</p>
<p>That way you play in window mode, but in fullscreen. It’s recommended a lot.</p>

            <p>I’ve got it working now window mode, by adding ‘-window’ on steam. I’ll try what you said for full screen though, thanks.</p>

            <p>I am no programmer, but i’ll try to help.</p>
<p>Try running the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>as an Administrator</li>
<li>with compatibility, Windows 7 for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also try changing the resolution manually in the config file “videoconfig.cfg” located here: C:\User\Steam\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bms</p>
<p>I am not sure if these could work, but i hope they would.</p>
