    <title>Not a bug - More of a request: Undo the UC music changes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/not-a-bug-more-of-a-request-undo-the-uc-music-changes/62772</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure you guys saw this coming and nothing will change your mind. but please, again:

1) Revert the latest musical changes to Unforeseen Consequences or make them optional
2) Remove the butt-slide mechanic from Gordon unless the LJM is equipped or make it optional

That is all.

I am sure other forum members will let you know they agree with me.

Thank you,

            <p>My quote from elsewhere, specifically r.e. the music on the headcrab elevator:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huh yeah, that music really doesn’t fit there, does it. It’s bleak revelation music, and going down the darkly silly headcrab slide isn’t really a bleakly relevatory moment either in the original or in Black Mesa.</p>
