            <p>Been watching the “LIFE” series by David Attenborough (it’s like the sequel series to Planet Earth).</p>
<p>Holy crap, it’s awesome! so many WEIRD creatures on earth that I didn’t know about!</p>
<p>Theres an episode where a beetle with giant horns is trying to find a mate, so he climbs up a huge tree, throwing rival males to their doom below until he climatically finds the female on a branch near the top… despite his efforts she’s not interested in him, so he ends up raping her and throwing her out of a tree. BRUTAL!</p>

            <p>Anyway, my dad said he watched a film about how Wall Mart uses cheap labor in China and has piss poor benefits to their employees. I’m not sure what it’s called though.</p>
<p>People do realize that you shouldn’t be working at Wall Mart to support a family, right? They need to go out and get a REAL job. Whether it’s working your back at a construction team, or sitting behind a desk, they both pay well and have great benefits. The only people that should be working at Wall Mart are teenagers that need money for pot and video games.</p>
<p>The Chinese sweatshops, however, I’m more concerned about. Again, I haven’t seen the film yet, but I can only hope no human rights are being violated. Plus, I hate it when an American company outsources to a foreign nation. Yes, I realize that it’s the reason the prices are low, but at what cost? Now there are fewer jobs for Americans, which is what we really need right now in this economy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s not true! Nuclear powerstations have fail-safe systems specifically for when all of mankind spontaneously disappears. Animals would generally be better off without humans, humans have caused much more rapid extinction in certain species than what would happen naturally because we interfere with ecosystems.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in that sort of thing then take a look at <a href="https://www.panoramio.com/photo/8095080" data-bbcode="true">Prypiat</a>, a small abandonned city near the Chernobyl nuclear plant which is slowly being reclaimed by nature. Trees growing through buildings and all that kind of jazz.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t remember the details but it was pretty clear regarding nuclear plants not having proper failsafe procedures to turn off the machines, or that they needed human intervention in order to engage the proper shutdown sequence.  Regardless… it made a pretty convincing point. And yes I have seen and learned in school the many problems of Chernobyl.  Still, it was slightly different than what was presented in the documentary.</p>
<p>Yes animals would be better off, but it talked more about scenarios where our interference created a more difficult problem for the species.  Example, domesticated dogs unable to fend for themselves, animals in zoos, ANY domesticated animal that has been spayed or neutered.  Even if they DO get out of the house/zoo and breed, their species may not live more than 2 generations.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a great documentary on how the earth would heal and get back to good within 300 years (or something like that) of human disappearance.</p>

<p>PBS Kids also has Dinosaur Train, the weirdest fucking kid’s show in the world. Family of Pteranodons adopt a T-rex and board a magical time-travelling steam engine train that takes them back and forth through the Mesozoic to visit the animals there.</p>
<p>It’s ridiculously awesome.</p>

<p>That’s not true! Nuclear powerstations have fail-safe systems specifically for when all of mankind spontaneously disappears. Animals would generally be better off without humans, humans have caused much more rapid extinction in certain species than what would happen naturally because we interfere with ecosystems.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in that sort of thing then take a look at <a href="https://www.panoramio.com/photo/8095080" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Prypiat</a>, a small abandonned city near the Chernobyl nuclear plant which is slowly being reclaimed by nature. Trees growing through buildings and all that kind of jazz.</p>

<p>I’ve never smoked anything a day in my life, but this documentary was certainly very informative and thought provoking.</p>
