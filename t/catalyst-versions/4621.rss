    <description>So I recently updated to Catalyst 10.6, and when I play Mass Effect 2 my computer crashes after about an hour of playing. Think I&#39;m gonna roll back to a previous version, any recommendations as to the best? Alternate solutions anyone has found? Running a 1GB Radeon 4890.</description>
