    <description>Hi, 

I was interested in learning more about the process involved in hosting your game file on our servers to allow others to download. 

Right now we are partnered with both Amazon and Rackspace, with availability in the United States, Europe and Asia (very fast download speeds). 

I used the &quot;Contact Us&quot; form, to ask the webmaster, but have not heard anything as of yet. 

If you could let me know, and we will get everything setup shortly. 

Thank you,
Ryan</description>
