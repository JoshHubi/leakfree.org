The year is 1899. Wealthy industrialist Oswald Mandus has returned  home from a disastrous expedition to Mexico, which has ended in  tragedy. Wracked by fever, haunted by dreams of a dark machine, he  recovers consciousness in his own bed, with no idea of how much time has  passed since his last memory. As he struggles to his feet, somewhere  beneath him, an engine splutters, coughs, roars into life...

And a new trailer was just released today

            <p>Another reason for the delay was that they were updating the game engine. That’s why they also passed it on to The Chinese Room for development, coupled with the fact that Frictional Games is working on an entirely new IP.</p>
<hr>
<p>The game file download size for A Machine For Pigs is 4.9 GB, which is more than 4x bigger than The Dark Descent, at 1.2 GB.</p>
<p>Just how fat are these pigs? ![/SIZE]</p>

            <p>Yeah, apparently the game started as an addon for the first game, not a full game itself. It was then delayed when they decided it was too good to confine to a really short addon and now it’s a full game on par with the first one.</p>

            <p>A Machine for Pigs is available now for preorder on GoG, Steam, and other sites. Some places have a 20% discount, making it $16 to preorder. It’s $20 normally. There’s also a bunch of screenshots put up and the system requirements.</p>
<p>Requirements<br>
Minimum:<br>
Processor: 2.0 Ghz core i5 CPU or equivalent.<br>
Memory: 2 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: Mid-range NVIDIA GeForce 3x0 / ATI Radeon HD 5x00. Integrated Intel HD Graphics should work but is not supported; problems are generally solved with a driver update.<br>
Hard Drive: 5 GB available space</p>
<p>Recommended:<br>
Processor: 2.0 Ghz core i7 CPU or equivalent.<br>
Memory: 4 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: High-range NVIDIA GeForce 5x0 / ATI Radeon HD 6x00. Integrated Intel HD Graphics should work but is not supported; problems are generally solved with a driver update.<br>

<p>They seem pretty high for some reason. Higher than a lot of games.</p>
<p>Also some screenshots</p>

            <p>Well, it looks downright terrifying from the trailer, but I agree that it looks like there might be problems with acclimatization.</p>
<p>Maybe they’ll focus largely on puzzles for the beginning, then ramp up the horror more towards the end or something.</p>

            <p>It seems a little…silly. By comparison to the previous games at least.</p>
<p>The problem I have with Amnesia games is that they start of great, but tend to lose steam and become just puzzle games by the end. I get acclimated to the spooky atmosphere, and it becomes less scary.</p>
