    <description>This is pretty sad: [url]https://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/28/activision-shuts-down-fan-made-kings-quest-sequel/[/url]  The Activision money train once again takes a dagger the the gaming community that has made them successful.

After successfully fighting a cease and desist order by Vivendi Universal five years ago, the unofficial continuation to the King&#39;s Quest series has been shut down for good. In 2005, fans successfully convinced Vivendi to allow the indie team behind The Silver Lining to continue development, thanks in part to a letter writing campaign.

            <p>Well, potentially this could mean that the Modern Warfare brand could become an independent entity if the founders of IW manage to win the case.</p>
<p>In which case, Activision would lose quite a sum of money and gamers could benefit quite a bit from having Infinity Ward as a free agent. After all, look what happened when Hideki Kamiya left Capcom. He made Bayonetta, which beat the hell out of Devil May Cry 4 in every possible way.</p>

            <p>Well, id DID release a web browser compatible, freeware version of Quake 3 called “Quake LIVE.” Perhaps that had something to do with why they shut down the mod. In id’s defense, bear in mind that they’re GPLing their engine techs. Wonder what will happen to the modding community when id Tech 4 gets GPLed.</p>
<p>Might be interesting to see what pops up. After all, check out “Nexuiz-” That game is running on modified id Tech 3 code and it’s graphics are actually quite competitive with other freeware engines like Saurbraten.</p>

            <p>Yet another reason to love Valve and their contribution to PC gaming. I just hope that the boycott didn’t tarnish how Valve feels about their fanbase.<br>
Thanks allot, retards, for making us look bad. All 40 thousand of you.</p>

            <p>Seems a shame to waste all their work.  But then that’s the risk you take I guess.  I wonder if they’ll be able to salvage any of it to make their own, independent, game.</p>
<p>Didn’t someone try to do a remake of Quake 3 in source and got promptly shut down by id?</p>

            <p>My guess is because Activision have plans for the series, and didn’t want a non commercial fan-made game to steal their thunder. It would be congruent with their plans for acquiring the franchise an’ all.</p>
<p>Pretty much the same thing that LucasArts did with the Monkey Island series. IIRC, there was a team that proposed to do a remake of the series, but it was shut down by LA shortly after they began. A few months/years later and bam, new games and remade versions of the old ones hit the virtual shelves.</p>

<p>Typical forum response I was expecting though you fail to see the bigger picture…</p>

            <p>Fair enough, I must be getting to old to have to explain Kings Quest  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is King’s Quest?</span></p>
<p>King’s Quest is Sierra On-Line’s flagship series of adventure games, designed by the award-winning Roberta Williams. It centers on the adventures of the royal family of the Kingdom of Daventry, and combines memorable characters, often mind-bending puzzles, great storylines, and fun gameplay. Most of the puzzles and many of the characters are inspired by myth and folklore, making the games easy to enjoy for anyone who plays them.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is “The Silver Lining”?</span></p>
<p>“The Silver Lining” is the fan-designed ninth episode inspired by the King’s Quest series.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">From the <a href="https://www.tsl-game.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Silver Lining Home</a></span></p>
<p>Recently, however, ownership of the Sierra IP changed hands and became the property of Activision. After talks and negotiations in the last few months between ourselves and Activision, they have reached the decision that they are not interested in granting a non-commercial license to The Silver Lining, and have asked that we cease production and take down all related materials on our website.</p>
<p>Its just concerning the implications this could have on other fan inspired creations.  I am sure Valve would never take this route though the possibility remains nonetheless.</p>

            <p>Pretty sure I posted the link and used the term <span class="bbcode-i">Activision shuts down fan-made King’s Quest sequel</span>, says it all really.  Activision is killing of the modding community one IP at a time.</p>
<p>Kings Quest was one of the Biggest Adventure franchises ever created.</p>

            <p>Oh dear.<br>
Well, Im certainly not a troll and Im not sure why you gave my catz’ link.</p>
<p>The problem arises when you dont even to bother to explain what King’s Quest is, or what this mod is doing. Imagine if I went somewhere and said ‘hey look theres no Braid sequel! too bad huh’ they’d be like ‘cool story bro’.</p>
<p>Im open to listening to what you’re talking about. You just need to say a bit more.</p>

            <p>This is pretty sad: <a href="https://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/28/activision-shuts-down-fan-made-kings-quest-sequel/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/28/activision-shuts-down-fan-made-kings-quest-sequel/</a>  The Activision money train once again takes a dagger the the gaming community that has made them successful.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>After successfully fighting a cease and desist order by Vivendi Universal five years ago, the unofficial continuation to the King’s Quest series has been shut down for good. In 2005, fans successfully convinced Vivendi to allow the indie team behind The Silver Lining to continue development, thanks in part to a letter writing campaign.</p>
