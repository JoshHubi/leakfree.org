    <title>Lens Flare ?or other effect like FakeFactoryCM12?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lens-flare-or-other-effect-like-fakefactorycm12/13052</link>
    <description>I think Lens Flare would make the game more cinematic
Some people think that is annoying but will it possible in Black Mesa?
(with using Source sharder editor by biohazardpro)

(According to FakefactoryCinematic Mod)It seems Lens Flare,sunrays,Parallax mapping are possible in Source engine
but will the Source sharder editor work after Steampipe update?

Because i think most of the player will love this effect.

P.S. if it possible,it could be switch on/off for those who dont like

I really really want those effect will be a part of Black Mesa!!!:&#39;(
Sorry for my bad English:fffuuu:

<p>i found out how to add lens flares in black mesa!</p>
<p>i modded the sprites to show flares, when you add a file into the BMS file, it overwrites ANYTHING in-game that uses HL2 sound, models, textures ect. well all i did was overwrite the sprite files to lens flare pictures and it worked!</p>
<p>here is a picture using it for proof: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jascb1q6vg2tven/BLACKMESAFLARE_000001.jpeg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.dropbox.com/s/jascb1q6vg2tven/BLACKMESAFLARE_000001.jpeg</a></p>
<p>here is the download: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g7xchfm8ebv2gw3/BMS_LENS_FLARES.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.dropbox.com/s/g7xchfm8ebv2gw3/BMS_LENS_FLARES.zip</a></p>
<p>just follow the instructions and they will work.</p>
<p>the only issue i saw using these is that sometimes the flare does not line up perfectly with the light source, but it is pretty accurate  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>have fun you all!</p>
<p>(by the way, i found this before i made the modification, and decided to research some, and i found the sprites for the lights, they are called “Glow” and are in “GAMENAMEHERE\materials\sprites” in the Half Life 2 Folders.</p>
<p>if you don’t know what i am talking about, it may be I did the research and know how to use and mod source.</p>
<p>OK BYE NOW YOU ALL TRY OUT MY MOD OR YOU DIE  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>^you can’t. Lens flare is effectively a distorted bloom. That being said, with a high threshold and color grading that keeps too many visual elements from blowing out, it can be reigned back appropriately.</p>

            <p>I have no idea how this shader editor works but if you could apply it to specific elements without affecting every light source that is being rendeted then it might have a usefull purpose.</p>
<p>In those videos you posted the lighting effects look quite bad on sprites whilst the glimmering sun looked quite good.</p>
<p>But ultimately if the shader cannot differentiate from different types of light sources it is no good</p>

            <p>Stone me, but I love lens flares both in action games, both in Star Trek.  Still, I think BM is fine with it, and there is a good reason why Fakefactory was not accepted into the dev team.</p>

            <p>You’re asking for a pummeling. Lens flare is pretty universally hated because it’s generally considered to be distracting and intrusive.</p>
<p>I sort of agree with you though, I always like seeing a bit of consistent visual noise in the form of film grain or lens flare.</p>
<p>It makes more sense with Gordon than any other game that uses the effect though. Lots of games that do lens flare and dirt have main characters that don’t wear glasses or helmets.</p>

            <p>I think Lens Flare would make the game more cinematic<br>
Some people think that is annoying but will it possible in Black Mesa?<br>
(with using Source sharder editor by biohazardpro)</p>
<p>(According to FakefactoryCinematic Mod)It seems Lens Flare,sunrays,Parallax mapping are possible in Source engine<br>
but will the Source sharder editor work after Steampipe update?</p>
<p>Because i think most of the player will love this effect.</p>
<p>P.S. if it possible,it could be switch on/off for those who dont like</p>
<p>I really really want those effect will be a part of Black Mesa!!!:’(<br>
