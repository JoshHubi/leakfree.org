    <title>Thinking about getting new monitor</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/thinking-about-getting-new-monitor/14489</link>
    <description>Been using the monitor I have right now for about 5 years now and want to get a new one. Not too sure what to look for though other than refresh rate and resolution and such though. I want a 144Hz monitor though so I&#39;m looking at those. Response times all seem to be about 1ms regardless of monitor, but the contrast ratio seems to vary quite a bit. The two I&#39;m currently looking at are

Seems like they don&#39;t really make 16:10 monitors anymore unfortunately and they&#39;re even rarer in high refresh rates. So do you guys have any suggestions for 144Hz monitors or just anything that I should be looking for to narrow down choices? My price range is about $400 max.</description>

<p>Not really too interested in Gsync/Freesync right now and I think it generally inflates the prices of monitors. I’d rather wait and see if Nvidia ever implements Freesync into their future GPUs so I can choose between them. Or not want a to get a Gsync monitor and get an AMD card later.</p>

<p>Fair enough. In most cases I don’t find tearing all that noticeable on my current 120Hz monitor anyway, so the 144Hz monitors you posted should be a further improvement over that even without adaptive-sync.</p>

<p>That monitor seems to have much worse contrast ratio than the ones I was thinking of getting. Might be worse than the one I have right now.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the specs for the XB240H might be using the static contrast ratio (usually in the 500:1 to 1000:1 range for TN monitors), whereas the others are using dynamic contrast ratio (which usually seems to be whatever number the manufacturer feels like typing in - anything from 15,000:1 to ∞[/size]:1).<br>
That said, the reviews for the XB240H do tend to mention “washed-out” colours…</p>
<p>Maybe someone else will have a better suggestion</p>

            <p>I’d suggest the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009729&amp;cm_re=xb240h-_-24-009-729-_-Product" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Acer XB240H Abpr</a> (144Hz / G-Sync* / ULMB for &lt;$400 USD), but can’t seem to find any really detailed reviews for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>think I remember you mentioning that you have an Nvidia GPU (GTX 970?)</li>
</ul>
