    <title>Explosive weapons damage radius too small?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/explosive-weapons-damage-radius-too-small/10874</link>
    <description>Any one else feel like the blast radius for the satchel charges, grenades, and rockets is too small?

I first noticed this when happening across a pack of sleeping hound eyes, I decided to test out my newly acquired satchel charges. Exploding one next to one of the four sleeping hound eyes (in the hallway in blast pit, all within a circle of about 1 to 1.5 meters) 2 of them managed to survive and retaliate.

The satchel charges are supposed to be bags the size of your head full of C4, yet their damage radius is ridiculously tiny, pretty much on par with the grenade. In the original half life you could clear out small rooms with the things, now they just play like a explode on demand grenade that you can&#39;t throw as far.

I also think the grenades and rockets could use a small boost to their damage radii. Nothing like the beefing up the satchel charge needs, but maybe just a couple notches bigger.</description>

            <p>I think increasing the damage also increases the radius.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Does anyone know where u can change the grenade explosion radius?</p>
<p>I have been doing some modding and would like to know thanks.</p>
<p>So far i have changed a fair few of the sounds in the game and i feel it captures the atmosphere from half- life a little more.</p>
<p>Changelog:<br>
Shotgun - new reload and firing sounds<br>
Mp5 - new firing sound<br>
pistol -  new firing sound<br>
grenade, tripmine, satchel charge -  original explosion sound<br>
magnum - more original</p>
<p>Zombie - less comical<br>
houndeye - more original<br>
Alien slave- more original<br>
barnacle - some original sounds added</p>
<p>I think its much better sounding than it was. If anyone would like a copy just say and i will upload it somewhere.</p>

            <p>Trip mines seem to have an effective blast radius, I think.  Soldiers go right through them  and die every time, sometimes two at a time.</p>
<p>I, too think that the satchel charges could use a boost to their underwhelming radii.  At least, if you sneak up to a group like those houndeyes and toss the charge in the middle, they don’t survive.</p>

            <p>Forgot to mention the grenade launcher and trip mines. Even though I think the hand grenades blast is a tad to small, the mp5 grenades feel right to me (I’m assuming they should be the same due to the similar size). Though if the hand grenades blast area is increased the mp5s grenade blast should be scaled accordingly.</p>
<p>Haven’t had the chance to use trip mines, the sp doesn’t give many chances to. Anybody have any input on those?</p>

            <p>Exactly the same experience with houndeyes here! I thought it was odd but not a major issue.</p>
