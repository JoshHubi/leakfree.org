    <title>BSOD and HL2 Crashes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bsod-and-hl2-crashes/11558</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have a problem with Black Mesa, after some tome of playing (like 7 minutes) this game freezes my computer and then a get BSOD. With this issue the game is almost unplayable.

My PC Specs (it´s laptop):
OS - Win 7 Home Premium, 64-bit, SP 1
CPU: Intel Core I7-26300QM
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GT 540M
RAM: 8 GB (4+4)

Drivers are up-to-date, my system is [b]not [/b]overheating (maximal tempurature was around 80°C)
Driver for GT 540M is 306.97 (I used the &quot;clean installation&quot; option to update)

Any other applications on source engine are working properly (CSS, Portal)

Unfortunately when i get BSOD the Black Mesa doesn´t create the dump file so I´am posting some previous minidump when only HL2 stopped working and screenshot,  because the whole win7 dump file is too large (over 500MB).
 
I was looking forward to play remake of the legendary Half-Life, but this makes me really upset. Sorry for my bad English. Thanks for any advice.
