    <title>Black Mesa is awesome! Any other free games?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-is-awesome-any-other-free-games/11686</link>
    <description>Kudos! Black Mesa is awesome!  I never played Half Life so finding this updated mod with better graphics and such was great. It is hard to believe it was free. I can&#39;t tell you how many hours I&#39;ve spent playing this game.  But I&#39;m guessing that if you play you already know because this thing is huge!  :slight_smile:   I will probably play it again and again at harder level settings. 
The puzzles were sometimes hard but well worth it. The graphics, music, and sound effects were spectacular. I played it in 3D on my 32&quot; Visio TV;  That made it even more fun.  Y&#39;all did a fantastic job on this mod. Wow! And thanks for all the hard work; We do appreciate it!

I was wondering if anyone here knew about any other games that had been released for free like this. I know Descent I &amp; II are out there (Unfortunately they are sitting on Descent 3 and letting it wither.)  But there must be some other free quality games out there also.  I know a lot of the old DOS games are out there but I am looking for more modern games/mods like Black Mesa. Games I can play in 3D with modern equipment and Windows 7.  Any ideas?</description>

<p>Yeah, many of those are actually excellent games. Nice list. I personally would also recommend Cave Story and Team Fortress 2.</p>
