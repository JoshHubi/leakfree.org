    <description>Hey all. 

My computer lab runs xubuntu linux.
I need to run windows games, and other complex applications involving 3d rendering in real-time, like hammer. I don&#39;t want to use vm&#39;s.
For now we can say that money is no object, sky&#39;s the limit.
Gentlemen (and Ladies) please keep this thread clean, and free of trolling.
Please suggest sensibly, and do cite your download locations.

Thank you.</description>

<p>Vista doesn’t suck.  I’ve never had a single error/problem with it.  Early adopters may have got the shaft but that’s the way it goes.  Vista is vastly superior to XP imho.  I think for most people that have problems with Vista it comes down to PEBCAK.</p>

<p>There are lots of things not so good about Vista (including lumping DRM into DX10), but my main point was that win7 is that much better than Vista performance-wise.</p>
<p>(That said, there are quite a few good things in Vista too, so I’m not saying it’s completely sucky…)</p>

            <p>WINE is decent, most source games (along with steam) work almost perfectly, albeit with a slightly reduced frame rate - HL2DM runs about 5-10 fps slower in wine than in windows on my craptop, for example.</p>
<p>You could also go the route of CrossOver Games, which guarantees compatibility with a number of games, but costs money. It’s based on the WINE source code and contributes back to the WINE project both financially and developmentally. Several WINE developers are involved pretty heavily in the project. $40 I believe.</p>
<p>Cedega/WineX is similar, but it isn’t well-regarded in the OSS community because they are, like CrossOver, a fork of WINE, but unlike CO they don’t contribute back to WINE.</p>
