    <title>Laptop advice</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/laptop-advice/4543</link>
    <description>Hi guys, I need some advice.  My work has just told me I have a £700 budget to buy a laptop. (I have to spend all the £700, so a little over is okay).  The only other proviso is its bought from a UK vendor, and probably directly from the manufacturer. 

I been doing a little research, but I&#39;m pushed for time.  Anyone got any suggestions what I should get? (If someone knows of an i7 and a good Radeon graphics card for that price I will be ecstatic lol)</description>

            <p>Lol, our IT for our dept consists of a guy who’s supposed to be the IT guy for another dept, and he’s a bit creepy.  My main desktop has all the power I really need in honesty, it a has dual intel xeon processors (4 cores per processor) and 16GB of ram, and some high-end graphics card, this laptop is so I don’t lose my budget allocation this year.  So I’m fairly free on what I spend it on, but I might as well get something I can game on.  Plus the IT dept will attempt to purchase from Dell, but I don’t have to as I have special computational needs.</p>
<p>And my supervisor wants me to spec it. lol.</p>

<p>Just a thought, if you’re a fellow scientist, do you not have an IT department who will make suggestions (i.e. very strong ones) as to what you should be buying? We do.</p>

            <p>I use a laptop every day, my advice is think about weight! (Unless you never have to move it, in which case go nuts)</p>
<p>Also, nice one on the £700  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
