    <title>What you did for Halloween</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-you-did-for-halloween/1713</link>
    <description>The title is self-explanatory. Post anything, whether it be getting drunk or doing jack shit if you&#39;re one of those cultural cynics.

Me? I, my brother and his friends, went trick-or-treating (Average age 16- yes, you can never to old to trick or treat) for 2 hours, visiting every damn house within half a mile. Along the way a cop offered us snickers (Everyone&#39;s reaction was &quot;WTF&quot;. I distrust cops who offer candy; I always think they&#39;re pedophiles considering how many kids have been victimized the same way). Since everyone was a L4D character (except for me. I went as Zoro [which made me feel insulted]), he of course checked out all the airsoft guns to make sure they weren&#39;t real (Cops can be real dicks sometimes &gt; :frowning:  ) Of course there were lines repeated from the game. Almost everyone in the neighborhood has stairs to get up to their front door, so &quot;I hate stairs&#39; was said only about 70 times

When we got back, we threw all the candy we didn&#39;t want onto the floor, where everyone beat the crap out of each for a piece of candy, with some people, including me, scouring along the floor in Zoidberg-like fashion. All in all, the day was great shit.</description>

            <p>Yeah no Halloween around here either… just a regular day, not even a holiday  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> .</p>
<p>It’s called “Witch’s Day” around here, but it doesn’t even come close to what Halloween is in other places. Basically just an excuse for kids to make parties with themes like zombies and whatever. Emphasis on kids; since it isn’t a holiday, most people go to work/study normally, so only kids have parties this day  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> .</p>

            <p>Went to my friend’s house and watched ‘28 Days Later’ and couple of episode’s of ‘Dead Set’ to get us in the zombie killing mood.</p>
<p>Stayed up a little bit playing some L4D, then went out dressed as some L4D special infected. Best of what the materials we had.</p>
<p>I was hunter :3 Leaped over my friends fence at about 3pm, scared the living shit out of him.</p>

            <p>Got drunk, smoked weed, bought candies, soaked my white Chuck Taylors in mud, made out with a girl I never met before… an average Saturday. Except for the shoes and candies part.</p>

            <p>I passed out Airheads to five Mexican children who came up one at a time. Then, their parents came up too, so I had to give them some also. I then spent half a hour in and around the toilet since I have some sort of flu, recieved some texts from my friends about how cool the party I missed was, did some history notes, watched Scream, started watching the modern Halloween but had to stop because it was way over the top, ate some candy, watched Lady in The Water, one of the worst movies I have ever seen, played some ODST with my friends, came onto here for some reason, and then went to sleep.</p>

            <p>I went trick or treating with a group of 10 people. We went around the neighborhood in this tiny car that we barely fit in and basically terrorized everyone.</p>
<p>I went as the Scout, just because I was pressed for time and I realized that I already had everything I needed.</p>
