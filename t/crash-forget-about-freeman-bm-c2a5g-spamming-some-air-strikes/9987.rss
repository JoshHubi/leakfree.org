    <title>[Crash] Forget about freeman(?) bm_c2a5g, spamming some air strikes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-forget-about-freeman-bm-c2a5g-spamming-some-air-strikes/9987</link>
    <description>This is either the very end of surface tension or the very beginning of forget about freeman, I don&#39;t know which, but I still haven&#39;t played the game through yet

Spammed air strikes, killed the gargantuan, and I guess I spammed one too many strikes - got a crash. I got a weird error box too but was too fast and clicked it away. 10 minutes of trying to reproduce this and I could not, sorry!


I think it might be a physics derp of some sort relating to a gib flying? :retard:

The mdmp should be attached.

If it&#39;s not
