    <title>Not a bug in traditional sense- continuity issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/not-a-bug-in-traditional-sense-continuity-issue/13981</link>
    <description>Hi,
As stated, this isn&#39;t necessarily a bug in the traditional sense, just a continuity issue that had me confused when I came across it.

Where?
In the level &quot;Power Up&quot; after you turn the power back on, the rail area where the injured security guard is.

At the begining of this level, once you meet the guard and he tells you he can&#39;t go on, the walkway gets destroyed.

Once you turn the power back on and go back to the guard, the walkway bridge is magically back to normal.

I know it&#39;s not a big issue or major bug, but I thought I would bring it up.

Great work on the mod! It&#39;s an amazing testament to how mods should be done.

Thanks for everything!</description>
