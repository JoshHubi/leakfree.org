    <title>cant open steam</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-open-steam/10186</link>
    <description>Hi
I installed black mesa yesterday and was able to open the game to the main menu. I turned it off then because didnt have time to play but this morning I cant open steam, its just stuck in my taskbar and doesnt expand when clicked on.

Ive tried playing the game directly through steam/steamapps etc but this has not worked.....

any ideas would be appreciated....</description>

            <p>Have you tried forcing the steam process to close with the task manager? If that doesn’t work try restarting your PC.</p>
