    <title>Weapons disappearing</title>

    <description>So I was in the tunnel in bm_c2a4h, leading to bm_c2a5h, and as my game loads bm_c2a5h I decided I wanted to go back to bm_c2a4h and explore the tunnel a bit more. When bm_c2a4h loaded back up, the only weapon showing up in the weapons menu was my crowbar (not even my currently equipped crossbow was appearing.) Going back to bm_c2a5h does not bring the weapons back either. The only option is to reload from my last save where I did have weapons. 

Seemed like a pretty troublesome bug, so I thought it&#39;d be best to report it immediately.</description>

            <p>I had the same thing happen during On A Rail. During the load screen when I came back out of the tunnels in the C2a2 section, the MP5 and Tau Cannon vanished from my inventory. I had to replay the previous sections of the map to fix it.</p>

            <p>I had a similar thing happen to me.  Turning around in that tunnel made me lose all of my weapons but the crobar.  (I think the pistol and mp5 may have stayed but I’m not sure.  I know everything else vanished)</p>
