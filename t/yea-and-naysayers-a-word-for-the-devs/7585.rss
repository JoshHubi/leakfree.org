    <title>Yea and naysayers, a word for the devs</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/yea-and-naysayers-a-word-for-the-devs/7585</link>
    <description>I know the community has had enough of trolls and negative comments.  I&#39;m not here to slam anyone, just exercise my free speech and share my thoughts or frustrations.  Probably been said millions of times, but that has never stopped one single human being from sharing in his praise or disgust.

     I have watched this mod from infancy.  And to this day I truly do not know if that child has become a man, or if it&#39;s growth was stunted by events out of the Devs&#39; control.  I know that a lot of work was put into this lovechild, and still is to this date.  It&#39;s just not enough sometimes, for a person&#39;s word to mean anything anymore.  Actions speak much louder, and human beings are prone to disbelief, even with their own faith in G_d, man, the Devil, or otherwise.  And I myself have lost a lot of faith in many things.

    Communication, or the lack thereof, is killing this Mod, whether you believe me or not.  A dev could scream at me with facts and details until he&#39;s blue in the face and I still would not believe him.  All the hard work and dedication in the world could not save a project of any scope unless one thing is present: the full dedication and support of the fans.  Believe it or not but all the work in the world will amount to a steaming pile of dren if you don&#39;t have that support.

     Doing this just for yourselves cannot be used as an excuse.  The day the team unleashed themselves and their massive project to the general populous is the day you made an unspoken oath to the fans of the Half Life Universe.  That is a heavy burden and one that cannot be taken back.  People have dedicated their time and desires to this project, negative or positive feedback, because they care.  Even the Trolls with their rude and useless comments have a glimmer of hope deep in their minds that this will see the light of day.

    Yet the longer things are delayed without 100% COMMUNICATION the more jaded and less hopeful people become.  By denying the community the ability to follow you all the way, by keeping them in the dark, you do them a great disservice, inadvertently effecting your futures as well.  What, you didn&#39;t do this for your sakes?  I find that hard to believe.  A successful mod of this magnitude could only mean that you hope this will open up new paths for you as a dev, designer, technician, programmer.  That cannot happen if people do not have faith in you.

    This team is the strongest thing I have seen in the mod community next to the MERP team.  And I don&#39;t want to lose my faith in the project.  But my interest has wavered, and my attention has gone to other things.  New engines and techniques have come and gone in the time we&#39;ve followed this project.  And the PR team whomever they may be needs to get the ball rolling.  year after year there have been misleading news onto the release date or progress on this.  And using the argument that info can be found in the forums doesn&#39;t work.

     People want to see the fruits of their hopes and aspirations, gathered for them to make it easier to believe.  Perhaps MODDB is not the place for you, but it is for the fans.  Hate it or love it, the people who grace the BM site on that website are a passionate bunch.  Their belief in the progress of this mod is unshaken no matter what one another posts there.  Even in your own forums dissension is ripe.  In the great words of a Stephen King character, &quot;Give me what I want and I&#39;ll go away.&quot;  This can apply to almost all trolls and non-believers.  And I have yet found an easy access point in which to follow this mod from process to procedure.   I&#39;m no idiot, I just hate forums; they&#39;re not a reliable source of information for those that hate browsing thousands of thoughts or ideas or complaints bundled together.

     I will continue to follow from time to time the evolution of the Black Mesa project, but I have lost the childlike fervor I once had in it.  Can you give that back to me?  Can you give that back to the community, the thousands upon thousands that look for this sweet eye candy with a child&#39;s excitement?  I want that back.  I want that unshaken faith back.  I&#39;m no rich man, I cannot give you a job in the industry or the money to make your lives more comfortable.  But what I can give is my support, if it is deserved and recognized.</description>

<p>Maxey, you’ve tried explaining this to the posters of such threads before and you’ve achieved nothing. You FAILED. What makes you think that this time will be different?</p>
<p>Get off your high horse and stop pestering everyone. Your minimodding is what keeps these moronic threads alive. And most experienced forumites can see through your blatant attempts to get into the Dev’s favor and become betatester or whatnot. You’re pathetic.</p>

<p>Not giving a release date is just as disappointing as missing one, to me at least. However, having a release date makes you feel that you’re not left completely in the dark. Not knowing is always annoying.</p>
<p>Of course, if there are other reasons for not giving a date, then I’m fine with it. I’m just saying that the “not wanting to disappoint us” justification doesn’t make a lot of sense.</p>

</aside>
<p>How about the ‘I’ve got bills to pay and a life to live so how about all you people whining about something we’re giving you for free go fuck yourselves.’?</p>
<p>Personally I’d have that in bold capitals at the top of the forum page.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/targ">@Targ</a>: He says that, but he doesn’t realise how retarded the statement is. Like the entirety of HL fans with internet aren’t going to hear about it from somewhere? As someone else said, even if they had of worked on this in secret, it’d still be the most talked about and downloaded HL2 mod once it was released.</p>
<p>As for that having an effect on how developers in the industry will see them. I very much doubt it’l have a negative impact at all. In the slightest.</p>

<p>He’s saying the mod will fail to be popular otherwise, which in turn will negatively impact the team’s futures as professional developers and artists.</p>
<p>Even if we agree for the sake of argument that lack of regular updates will make this an unpopular mod when it’s released, what I don’t understand is why he thinks that will cheapen their technical accomplishments or affect their chances of being hired. Either way, it’s going to be a niche product.</p>

            <p>Then I say…  GOD IS DEAD.</p>
<p>The developers are not required to give you all that you ask for, my lord.  And how faggots on the BMS forums complain does not slow down the progress of the mod.  They do not care.  If it is not apparent, the majority of the people anticipating BMS do not sign up for the site.</p>
<p>Yet they have the power to do so.  They choose to not make accounts and complain about something so pointless.  All information you need to know about the game is covered within the wiki and the media.  I’ve read that stuff front-to-back and I am not asking for more until it is updated.</p>
