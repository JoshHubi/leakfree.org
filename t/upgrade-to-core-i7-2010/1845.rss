    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/upgrade-to-core-i7-2010/1845</link>
    <description>Okay so next summer :3 in 2010 I want to upgrade to a core i7. I will also be getting windows 7 home premium 64 bit.

---------Parts--------------

Motherboard: Asus P6T6 WS Revolution
Prossesor: Core i7 920 2.6ghz(overclock to 3.3ghz? 
Ram: Corsair dominator 6gb of ddr3 ram.
Heat sink: Cooler Master v8
----------------------------
Old parts being transferred.

Two Asus Gtx 280 graphics card&#39;s  :slight_smile: 
Power supply: 1000 watt thermaltake
Case: Cooler master HAF 932. 

So this is basically what i&#39;m going to upgrade to in the summer is there anything better I can get? Also i&#39;m going to be air cooling my computer.
I also have one tiny question does Mozilla Firefox support 64 bit?</description>

<p>In case people are wondering why that is a troll. The core2 architecture came out late 2006, and AMD has yet to EVEN NOW release a single CPU to match the highest end core2 CPUs.</p>

            <p>not more powerful. cheaper, and definitely better than low end intels, but Intel has Amd beat at the top end. It’s a shame, some higher end competition would be great for prices.</p>

            <p>There already exists a bunch of offerings for coolers on both the 1156, and 1366.</p>
<p>The difference in price between the i7 920, and the i7 860 is minimal. I’m not sure where you come up with the idea that an x58 chipset board with a triple channel kit is close to the same price as a P55 chipset board with a dual channel kit.</p>
<p>There is very little impact of triple channel memory in gaming. The real reason to go with x58 at this point is the full PCIexpress x16 capability on multiple GPU set ups. With P55 when two PCIexpress slots are used they slow down to x8. This will be an issue with higher end cards, but for single card configurations additional x16 slots would be wasted.</p>
<p>I’m still not really sure the reasoning behind saying neither i7 800 series cpu is of value. The P55 boards are ( for the most part ) cheaper than current x58 chipset boards. Just because there are more 1366 socket CPUs coming out, it doesn’t mean that the 1156 socket will be abandoned.</p>
<p>I’m not sure where bit tech are looking but when the high end boards on the P55 chipset like the GD80 are selling for as low as $220 whereas the price of  the low end x58 chipset boards is about that price, there seems an obvious lack of price parity to me.</p>
<p>That whole thing is from bit tech? I think the article might be a bit out dated in regards to price etc.</p>
<p>Also, I would not worry about hyper threading.  The number of applications that support it, and show benefits from it are so minimal it’s a non factor. Hell, half of those applications are synthetic.</p>
<p>That being said if you have two of those monstrous video cards I would hit up the x58 chipset so you don’t hold them back at all. Remember that is if you bought RIGHT NOW. Prices and layout might change dramatically in a short while.</p>
<p>Core i9 is something I would only suggest if you want a big epeen. There is so few games that challenge dual core CPUs right now, high end quads aren’t even being touched. A 6 core monster would only be of interest if you you multi threaded desktop applications regularly.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Intel has created an odd position for its new Lynnfield CPUs by releasing them eight months after the high-performance LGA1366 platform. On the one hand, it’s great to see that Intel has finally produced a quad-core CPU that can hold its own against the best dual-core CPUs in games. This means that at long last, you can get the best performance in multi-threaded applications and games from one chip. However, this isn’t the same thing as saying that a Lynnfield-core CPU is the perfect upgrade from Core 2.</p>
<p>Beyond its confusing naming scheme, the big problem for Lynnfield is the cost of upgrading - you really need to sit down and do some maths before placing your order. To start with, let’s look at the price of building a Lynnfield system. As the earlier table showed, you could build a system with a Core i5-750 for just a little more than a system with a Core 2 Quad Q9650. As such, the Core i5-750 is clearly a great deal, as it’s 14 to 40 per cent faster than the Q9650.</p>
<p>Although there are three new Lynnfield-core processors at launch only once is worth buying. Click to enlarge.</p>
<p>In contrast, the fully-fledged LGA1366 Core i7-920 is cheaper than both of the new Lynnfield Core i7 CPUs. With LGA1156 and dual-channel DDR3 memory comparable in price to LGA1366 and triple-channel kits, there’s no point in opting for an LGA1156 Core i7 CPU at all. If you’re too lazy or scared to overclock, the Core i7-860 is faster thanks to Turbo Boost (rev 2), but the Core i7-920 is far faster when manually overclocked.</p>
<p>However, opting for an LGA1366 system has many advantages over an LGA1156 one. There’s a wider choice of motherboards and coolers, while the X58 chipset and triple-channel memory are better for gaming than P55 and dual-channel memory. Folders and multi-monitor enthusiasts will also appreciate the extra graphics slots of provided by X58, while having 6GB of memory for much the same price as 4GB is also welcome. Finally, we know that Intel will continue to release CPUs on LGA1366, as the company told us that prototypes of the six-core Gulftown CPU are currently being tested on LGA1366 motherboards. This forthcoming CPU probably won’t be cheap, however. Therefore, neither LGA1156 Core i7 CPU is worth buying - you’d be better off with an LGA1366 and Core-i7-920 system.</p>
<p>Of course, there will be cheaper LGA1156 motherboards on the way, which will help to make the Core i5-750 more attractive, the MSI’s P55-GD65 motherboard isnt bad, it’s still priced a bit too high. For the Core i5-750 to become a truly great purchase, there need to be a bunch of respectably-featured boards closer to the $150 mark because, even with the P55-GD65 and cheaper memory, the platform costs aren’t much lower than a Core i7-920 based system.</p>
<p>With that in mind, even if you like the look of the Core i5-750, you really should decide whether you can stretch to an i7-920 as things currently stand, just to make sure you’re getting a good deal. Either way, our advice is to go out and buy a Core i7-920 before Intel realises its mistake and discontinues it.<br>
[COLOR=‘Silver’]modified from bittech[/SIZE]</p>
<p>Some last remarks, i7 allows for hyperthreading and i5 does not.<br>
Your question about i9. YOu know of core duo and quad core. core i9 is a six core processor.</p>

            <p>The stock heatsinks are generally, if not always, good enough to cool it effectively without overclocking. i5 is the lower range, i7 will be the upper tier, and i9 will be god tier. Costs will escalate respectively.</p>
<p>Also, there’s future proofing, and then there is spending a shitload on parts that will drop in price in 6 months. Don’t spend money because you have it, spend it effectively. Right now I’d recommend the i5 to anyone upgrading their processor, because i7 is really overpriced for what you get from it right now.</p>

            <p>Will the core i9 be better than the i7? And will I be able to air cool it effectively?</p>

            <p>Ok.</p>
<ol>
<li>Way to early to decide what to buy now.</li>
<li>Get core i9 instead. It will be out by then.</li>
<li>Ask us again 1 month before you want to buy. Good that you’re thinking about it. For now just research computers and get to know stuff.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Why exactly do you need the $350+ motherboard? What does the Gigabyte EX58-UD5, even the ASUS P6T SE not do for you?</p>
<p>With two high end cards like dual GTX 280s the P55 chipset going down to 8x might limit you a tad. Also, I would never assume an overclock number. A goal maybe, but the 920 chips you are getting now, might not be as highly binned as the initial release chips.</p>
<p>What specific memory kit are you getting? Don’t worry about 64bit support. If you have windows 7 64 bit it shouldn’t be a problem for a fellow who looks to buy newer hardware.</p>
<p>Also you had better be gaming at the very least 4MP, or else I’m walking away.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">Everything</span> supports 64 bit.</p>
<p>Well, not everything, but compatibility isn’t a reason to not go for 64 bit. Prices will change and new stuff will be released by next summer, so don’t settle just yet.</p>

            <p>Okay so next summer :3 in 2010 I want to upgrade to a core i7. I will also be getting windows 7 home premium 64 bit.</p>
<p>---------Parts--------------</p>
<h2>Motherboard: Asus P6T6 WS Revolution<br>
Prossesor: Core i7 920 2.6ghz(overclock to 3.3ghz?<br>
Ram: Corsair dominator 6gb of ddr3 ram.<br>
Heat sink: Cooler Master v8</h2>
<p>Old parts being transferred.</p>
<p>Two Asus Gtx 280 graphics card’s  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Power supply: 1000 watt thermaltake<br>
Case: Cooler master HAF 932.</p>
<p>So this is basically what i’m going to upgrade to in the summer is there anything better I can get? Also i’m going to be air cooling my computer.<br>
I also have one tiny question does Mozilla Firefox support 64 bit?</p>
