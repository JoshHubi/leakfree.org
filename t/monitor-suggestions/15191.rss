            <p>How many bucks are you looking to spend?</p>
<p>I’ve got an ASUS ROG Swift PG278Q. It’s 1440p, 144hz, G-Sync, low response time. And TN panel, but I like that, because I tried IPS and was thoroughly unimpressed with it.</p>
<p>It was also about $700 when I bought it.</p>

            <p>Which monitor are you replacing?</p>
<p>Depending on the quality you are used to from the old monitor, if you are buying cheap you might end up disaspointed.<br>
For me, i am using the AOC F22+. Cheap 1080p, 60 FPS monitor with no special features (or hdmi input, but it is old though).</p>
<p>However, 7+ years in the running on settings:<br>
Contrast: 50/100<br>
Brightness: 80/100</p>
<p>Still running perfectly with no dead pixels or other faults.</p>
<p>Cons: The monitor isn’t placed on a stand, rather it’s designed to always be at an angle.<br>
Bit annoying, but not that bad.</p>
<p>I don’t remember what i paid for it.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Just buy any 1080p 60fps monitor from a respectable brand.</p>
