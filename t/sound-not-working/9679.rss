    <title>Sound not working.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sound-not-working/9679</link>
    <description>I recently downloaded Black mesa and was excited to play.  When I started playing I noticed that there was no sound.  I checked if my sound was on, if my headphones were working, and if the sound was on in the settings.  I didn&#39;t fix it, so I came to the forums.  Please help!</description>
