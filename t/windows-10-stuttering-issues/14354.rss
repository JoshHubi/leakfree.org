    <title>Windows 10 stuttering issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-10-stuttering-issues/14354</link>
    <description>Alright so I purchased Black Mesa on Steam last week and it worked fine with Windows 8.1, or at least it worked fine enough with my current laptop, which isn&#39;t high end at all. Unfortunately I after I installed windows 10, the game started having stuttering issues every few seconds. I was wondering if it is possible for me to manually fix this or if there is maybe a patch coming later on that will fix this stuttering issue that I&#39;m having?

I have an HP Pavilion Notebook PC running Windows 10 Home Edition.

Processor: Intel (R) Core(TM) i3-4000M CPU @ 2.40 GHz
RAM: 4.00 GB
System Type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
Graphics Card: Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600

I know that with this setup gaming isn&#39;t ideal but I didn&#39;t have this issue on Windows 8.1
Also both the game and the mod ran fine on Windows 8.1 and this is the only Source game that I am having this issue with.</description>

<p>I think I got a computer just like OP if not same model, where I can also test BM. It has windows 10 on it atm. Give me a day and I’ll see what I find. Is there a way for me to copy over the game files without re-downloading the whole thing?</p>

<p>What have you found out?</p>

<p>Been busy. Just copying over the files now. Will see how it goes later today.</p>
<p>And now that I have the game installed on my pavillion I can now start the test. Starting the game now.</p>
<p>Just finished the test, and the game runs perfectly fine. I don’t know what to say about your problem.</p>
