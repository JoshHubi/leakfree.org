    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/subtitles-problem/11614</link>
    <description>Hello every1. Something is wrong with my BMS. I can&#39;t see subtitles in the game. Not even in train but also when NPC talks there is no subtitles at all. 

I selected in sound options to show subtitles but nothing changed. 
In steam  tried to change language from my own language to english and in other side. Nothing changed. 

For now I have installed SDK BASE 2006 and 2007 (auto steam download), dwnlding now Source SDK... pretty heavy files lol. 3gb and 2x 2gb..... 

But i cannot find sourcesdk folder in steam folder (my account folder). 

Any conclusions? If some1 can help I would be very gr8full. 

BTW. I dwnlded torrent file with BMS of this site. I have translation files 4 BMS to use subtitles in my own language. 

HELP!:[

EDIT!

Good news folks! i got this, figured it out atlast. Now I have polish subs in game. Gr8.

Now I gonna finish BMS and start orange box&lt;3

Cheers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</description>
