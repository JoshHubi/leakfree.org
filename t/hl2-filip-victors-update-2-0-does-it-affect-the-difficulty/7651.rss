    <title>HL2 Filip Victor&#39;S Update 2.0, does it affect the difficulty?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-filip-victors-update-2-0-does-it-affect-the-difficulty/7651</link>
    <description>Hello to everyone!
I decided to play through Half-Life 2 again, but I wanted to boost up the graphics a little bit so I thought I&#39;ll try the HL2 Filip Victor&#39;S Update 2.0, it&#39;s up and running perfectly.
My &quot;problem&quot; or question may sound stupid, but does it affect the difficulty in some way?(I know it&#39;s a graphics mod but shit happens)
Because I&#39;ve played HL2 through 10 times(8 of them were on hard difficulty) and now it seems to be too easy, I mean the enemies die too fast, even from body shots (on hard difficulty) or is it just because I&#39;ve played it too many times?</description>

<p>You may have played it too many times. But you can create a custom skill config file, type cvarlist sk_ then go to town.</p>
<p>If you want to be lazy I attached a txt file. Just copy a cfg file inside of your hl2 folder then rename it “skill”, or w/e you want, I dunno if it’ll still be unable to load it automatically or not, since the valve engine update it’s been unable to automatically load .cfg files that are apart of the library already. (including the autoexec) and I don’t know how to fix that.</p>
<p>If it is unable to load it, open your console and bind a key to exec your cfg file (make sure it’s a different name than one of the stock)</p>
<p>You’ll find the game is much more difficult after boosting the health/damage of the npcs.</p>

            <p>I’ve read a lot about it and most of the fans say it’s bad, and not worth the 10 gigs… and I also read something like it doesn’t run on windows XP, but I’m not sure…</p>

            <p>Cinematic Mod is better, just take out the crappy models and soundtrack. (unless you prefer it) It’s an amazing experience as long as your PC can run it.</p>
