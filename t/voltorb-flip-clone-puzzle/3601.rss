    <title>VOLTORB Flip Clone! [PUZZLE]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/voltorb-flip-clone-puzzle/3601</link>
    <description>VOLTORB Flip is kind of a cross between Minesweeper, Picross and Suduko.

The story:
When the new Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver games were translated for the international releases, censorship reasons caused the gambling-section of the game to be removed and replaced with a win-win game called &quot;Voltorb Flip&quot;.

I liked this game so much that I made a PC clone, called &quot;VOLTORB Flip&quot;.
I&#39;ve added the ability to lose (Hit level 1 again and you lose half of your score, lose 1 level with each defeat) and removed the mostly un-used memo notes (With the numbers).

Changelog:

It features a five-by-five grid of tiles, underneath of which are hidden numbers (which multiply the player&#39;s score if located) and Voltorb (which Selfdestruct and cause the player to lose all points). The player can easily figure out where the Voltorb are located by using the clues provided: the number of Voltorb in each line and column are noted at the side of the screen. If the player can find all of the 2x and 3x multipliers, they will be able to advance to harder levels.

Need to add stuff!

* Score board - To keep records of scores (Possibly online also?)
* Sound effects - With a mute button. If anyone has cool sound effects then please tell!
* Game Info - Still needs completing.


A probably not-going-to-be-used feature:
Because I was lazy, I kept the cards outside of the executional, this means that people can customise the cards and add in their own personal &quot;deck&quot; and designs. Neat-o!

Controls:
Left-click reveals a tile
Right-click toggles flag (On/Off)</description>
