    <title>Anyone bothered by the increase of DURRR on this site?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anyone-bothered-by-the-increase-of-durrr-on-this-site/11258</link>
    <description>I knew that things would change once the mod was released, but I never expected so much durrrr to occur.  
Even oldies have turned into complete morons since the mod was released.

I&#39;m mainly talking about the idiotic [b]&quot;&lt;This&gt; needs changing&quot;[/b] threads.  Of course, some of them are pretty valid suggestions; but you have to admit that 90% of them are utterly retarded.

IQs were never majorly high here to begin with.  Now I think they&#39;ve dropped to an all time low.


So, I thought I&#39;d go ahead and list some of the most stupid complaints/suggestions I&#39;ve read so far;

---------------------------------------

One guy complained that there was too much deviation from the original.  And I don&#39;t just mean added bits of map, but the fact that they had changed anything at all (e.g. additional signs, vending machines, cars, cacti)

There was a mild amount of rage over the changing of the crowbar location.

Sorry Oldfag (you know who you are) but in-game cut scenes are just retarded.  Valve went into great detail as to why they don&#39;t use such scenes often in their games.  Their reasons were very good.  So why you&#39;d want to break the pacing and immersion is beyond me.

The complaints about the tentacles have been dumb.  A few people are genuinely upset that you have to run past them rather than crawl.  Big deal.</description>

            <p>These forums have always been derp, its just that back then we were young and derp too, and there were no oldfags around to tell how much better the forums used to be. Complaining about newfags is barely a step above being a newfag. Its probably worse even.</p>
