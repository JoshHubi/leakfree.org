Israeli forces have attacked a flotilla of aid-carrying ships aiming to break the country&#39;s siege on Gaza.

At least 19 people were killed and dozens injured when troops intercepted the convoy of ships dubbed the Freedom Flotilla early on Monday, Israeli radio reported.

The flotilla was attacked in international waters, 65km off the Gaza coast.

Avital Leibovich, an Israeli military spokeswoman, confirmed that the attack took place in international waters, saying: &quot;This happened in waters outside of Israeli territory, but we have the right to defend ourselves.&quot;

Footage from the flotilla&#39;s lead vessel, the Mavi Marmara, showed armed Israeli soldiers boarding the ship and helicopters flying overhead.

Al Jazeera&#39;s Jamal Elshayyal, on board the Mavi Marmara, said Israeli troops had used live ammunition during the operation.

  	Aftermath of Israel&#39;s attack on Gaza flotilla

The Israeli military said four soldiers had been wounded and claimed troops opened fire after &quot;demonstrators onboard attacked the IDF Naval personnel with live fire and light weaponry including knives and clubs&quot;.

Free Gaza Movement, the organisers of the flotilla, however, said the troops opened fire as soon as they stormed the convoy.

Our correspondent said that a white surrender flag was raised from the ship and there was no live fire coming from the passengers.

Before losing communication with our correspondent, a voice in Hebrew was clearly heard saying: &quot;Everyone shut up&quot;.

Israeli intervention

Earlier, the Israeli navy had contacted the captain of the Mavi Marmara, asking him to identify himself and say where the ship was headed.

Shortly after, two Israeli naval vessels had flanked the flotilla on either side, but at a distance.

Organisers of the flotilla carrying 10,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid then diverted their ships and slowed down to avoid a confrontation during the night.

They also issued all passengers life jackets and asked them to remain below deck.

Al Jazeera’s Ayman Mohyeldin, reporting from Jerusalem, said the Israeli action was surprising.

&quot;All the images being shown from the activists on board those ships show clearly that they were civilians and peaceful in nature, with medical supplies on board. So it will surprise many in the international community to learn what could have possibly led to this type of confrontation,&quot; he said.

Meanwhile, Israeli police have been put on a heightened state of alert across the country to prevent any civil disturbances.

Sheikh Raed Salah,a leading member of the Islamic Movement who was on board the ship, was reported to have been seriously injured. He was being treated in Israel&#39;s Tal Hasharon hospital.

In Um Al Faham, the stronghold of the Islamic movement in Israel and the birth place of Salah, preparations for mass demonstrations were under way.

Protests

Condemnation has been quick to pour in after the Israeli action.

Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, officially declared a three-day state of mourning over Monday&#39;s deaths.

Turkey, Spain, Greece, Denmark and Sweden have all summoned the Israeli ambassador&#39;s in their respective countries to protest against the deadly assault.
Worldwide outrage has followed the deadly Israeli attack of Gaza aid convoy [AFP] 

Thousands of Turkish protesters tried to storm the Israeli consulate in Istanbul soon after the news of the operation broke. The protesters shouted &quot;Damn Israel&quot; as police blocked them.

&quot;(The interception on the convoy) is unacceptable ... Israel will have to endure the consequences of this behaviour,&quot; the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement.   

Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, has also dubbed the Israeli action as &quot;barbaric&quot;.

Hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists, including a Nobel laureate and several European legislators, were with the flotilla, aiming to reach Gaza in defiance of an Israeli embargo.

The convoy came from the UK, Ireland, Algeria, Kuwait, Greece and Turkey, and was comprised of about 700 people from 50 nationalities.

But Israel had said it would not allow the flotilla to reach the Gaza Strip and vowed to stop the six ships from reaching the coastal Palestinian territory.

The flotilla had set sail from a port in Cyprus on Sunday and aimed to reach Gaza by Monday morning.

Israel said the boats were embarking on &quot;an act of provocation&quot; against the Israeli military, rather than providing aid, and that it had issued warrants to prohibit their entrance to Gaza.

It asserted that the flotilla would be breaking international law by landing in Gaza, a claim the organisers rejected.

<p>This isn’t going to start a war. Last summer Israel sank a humanitarian aid ship with US congressional delegation (although nobody was killed). I’m more worried about what’s going on with North/South Korea and the S. Korean military ship that got torpedoed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>North Korea’s army and general country is too weak, and I doubt that they’ll get the support of China if they invaded North Korea. China is still a red state, but they get most of their money from the West, so they wouldn’t support a country that was invading a country supported by the USA. If they went into South Korea, they would be pushed back into the North.</p>

<p>just another remark that nothing about human is really important for the rest of the universe…</p>
<p>However, our activities are natural mechanism that makes us bend to the equilibrium point, no crash, no bomb, or no kill.<br>
Moral is the obvious example. Moral and religion handle us , not to make something bad to each other–big trouble for making equilibrium.</p>
<p>ฺำThe topic ‘life after death’ too, make good things before it’s too late, thought that you know what i mean, is another stratagem for…as like as its meaning.</p>
<p>BTW, I’ve never said that stopping the war is a bad act, but actually said ‘don’t care about it’…</p>

            <p>I know that this might be calling for a lot, but it’s possible to incapacitate someone without killing them, even in a situation like that.  I think that cops need to be trained a lot better than they are and then only allowed on the streets for limited amounts of time so that they have a chance to recuperate.  Cops are people too and if you keep them “on the beat” (as it were), then begin to get cynical and, pardon me for saying so, a bit psychotic (treating others as automatons).  Anyone would if they had to deal with the scum of the earth all the time.  It’s not their fault.</p>
<p>But they do need recuperation time, which I don’t see happening.</p>

            <p>Don’t actually know. However since he was killed I doubt they would have gone for the legs, which is what they should have done. But then again fear can affect your decisions a lot.</p>

            <p>Hey, it works in movies, right?  I mean, you just need to take a satellite image of the crime scene and tell the computer to “enhance” and you’ll be able to make out the DNA pattern left on a hair and match it to the killer in only three minutes so you can shoot the knives out of his hand, right?</p>
<p>Quick question, baconeggs:  Where did they shoot him?</p>

<p>Police never recieve positive publicity. There was a case here in Australia where a teenager advanced upon some officers waving two knives. In the end they had to shoot him otherwise he would have ended up cutting them up.</p>
<p>The family was clearly upset, and argued that the police should have <span class="bbcode-i">shot the knives out of his hands.</span></p>
