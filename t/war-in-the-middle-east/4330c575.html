<blockquote>
<p>You’re quoting the Israel military justifying their own actions and asking me how I “reconcile” it? And what do you mean “even a US diplomat criticized the protesters,” surely you realize US backing is the only reason Israel can undertake this kind of military action with impunity? I thought you were studying this stuff?<br>
More on quotes from Israeli officials describing why they are “punishing” the Gazans in a few minutes…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So basically if the IDF say it it <span class="bbcode-i">must</span> be wrong. I don’t think there’s any denying the fact that the situation in Gaza is grim, but can’t you at least for a second consider where Israel is coming from? They have, right next to them, a hostile group intent on their destruction. Isn’t it justified for them to try to take actions, such as sanctions and blockades, for them to stop prohibited materials from entering the region?</p>
<p>And you still haven’t explained why Israel would punish the Gazans. What would they gain? Cutting of supplies to Hamas, to me, is justified. Its no different from how the US has massive sanctions around countries that it doesn’t like in the hope of cutting off supplies (like, I don’t know, North Korea?). And if they can use the blockade as a bargaining tool to reduce rocket attacks (i.e. reduce sanctions to reduce attacks), as they have in the past, then isn’t that worth it?</p>
<p>And on the US backing Israel; if you’ve been paying attention to a lot of the fallout recently (specifically after the 2009 invasion and the assassination of…that guy in India), the nature of the US-Israel relationship is rapidly changing. The US is growing increasingly critical of Israel and the time of passive inaction is rapidly drawing to a close. There are many people from many different nations who have spoken out against the protester’s actions, but if you’re looking at Turkey’s comments for accuracy, I don’t think you’ll find much there.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most people who have condemned Israel have done so for the blockade, NOT for what they did on the flotilla.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree. However, this wasn’t a case of them doing whatever they want to whomever happened to be around. This was a group of protesters who were warned not to come, but did anyway. They posed a threat because they were going to violate the blockade. If they truly had nothing but humanitarian aid, then why didn’t they do what Israel said and distribute through the existing channels?</p>
<p>That was what Israel offered. They refused. Something looked suss. So Israel boarded the flotilla’s with the objective of securing them, filtering out any stuff that wasn’t allowed through and delivering the rest. They just wanted to make sure there <span class="bbcode-i">wasn’t</span> a threat; that’s why they boarded the ships with non-lethal weaponry.</p>
<p>Israel told the boats not to come. When they left, they asked them to redirect to another port. When they didn’t, they warned them that they would be boarded. Israeli commandos boarded the vessels with non-lethal weaponry and secure them. They were attacked with pipes, chains, guns and knives. They responded in kind. Soldiers on both sides were injured.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why should they defend themselves? Israel told them that they were coming on board, that they should not resist, and 8 out of 9 boats did not see the need to defend themselves. They boarded the last one and were attacked. You only need to look at the video for evidence of that. They didn’t start defending themselves when they were attacked by the Israelis; the Israelis defended themselves when the passengers onboard the boat started attacking them.</p>

If they truly had nothing but humanitarian aid, then why didn’t they do what Israel said and distribute through the existing channels?</p>

</aside>
<p>Maybe because they felt the aid wouldn’t go through that way?</p>

<p>Israel told the boats not to come. When they left, they asked them to redirect to another port. When they didn’t, they warned them that they would be boarded. Israeli commandos boarded the vessels with non-lethal weaponry and secure them. They were attacked with pipes, chains, guns and knives. They responded in kind.

<p>So, a burglar has a right to defend themselves against an attacking homeowner?  O_o</p>

          <p>The rioters tied to get through the blockade despite plenty of warnings not to. When Israeli soldiers boarded the ships, the rioters started to riot. The soldiers defended themselves by shooting. The gravest error here has been made by the rioters (or “aid givers”).</p>
<p>Now, you may question the existence of the blockade, being in international waters an all, but that doesn’t change the fact that the blockade was there, that it was widely known that there was a blockade and that Israel gave plenty of warnings to the rioters when they tried to penetrate the blockade regardless of all the previous factors.</p>
<p>They took a swing at Israel. Despite knowledge, despite warnings, they still took a swing. If they had been smart, they would’ve stayed home and send the aid through other means, rather than trying to break the blockade. At that point the question whether Israel was in its right to be there doesn’t matter. The fact is that they were there, that it was known that they were there, and that they sent plenty of warnings.</p>
<p>It’s a war. Innocent civilians die in wars. But I don’t consider these people to be innocent civilians. They knew very well what they were getting into.</p>
<p>Oh and daniel: homeowners get sued/convicted a lot for attacking a burglar.</p>

</aside>
<p>But that’s not a fair analogy. Israel said “guys, we’re coming on board to secure the ships and then escort you home, don’t resist”. 8 out of the 9 ships had already been boarded and no harm had come to those passengers; why then did these protesters feel the need to resist? Furthermore, the protesters were told NOT to sail their ships towards Gaza, and yet they did.</p>
<p>Moreover, why is it irrelevant that the rest of the ships didn’t resist? To me, that’s a clear indication of the level of harm appreciated. Why did the rest of the ships not appreciate harm to the level that, as per your analysis, the last ship did? Why did every other ship not ‘defend’ itself in the same manner as the last one?</p>
<p>Here’s an analogy for you: Image a boat was coming towards America with a load of Mexican illegals on board. The Americans told them to go away, but they kept coming. When they neared America’s coast, the Americans sent out the Coast Guard with the goal of securing the ships, bringing them into port, processing the illegals and sending them home. When the Coast Guard boarded, however, they were attacked by the Mexicans. They responded, and a few of the Mexicans die, with some of the US guys being seriously injured.</p>
<p>So, in that scenario, would the US have done anything wrong?</p>

<p>Oh please, you’d all be yelling about the dirty Mexicans attacking your bastions of true justice.</p>
<p>Its all about perception; Israel is perceived as the bad guy, so all the ‘facts’ end up being against them. Take a different example: Guantanamo Bay. US sets up torture centre in far off country so they can escape liability. They then refuse to classify them as combatants so international law doesn’t apply. However, even though they then go on to commit heinous human rights violations against often innocent people (<em>cough</em> David Hicks <em>cough</em>), nobody bats an eyelid. You label the prisoners as terrorists and suddenly the whole thing gets swallowed. Its only very recently that perceptions have changed, but wind the clock back 5-10 years and you see <span class="bbcode-i">exactly</span> the same thing with Isreal; perception fundamentally alters and changes the way we see legality and morality.</p>

<p>People typically cite <span class="bbcode-i">non-biased</span> sources when attempting to prove a point.

<p>Secondly, you said it yourself, Israeli’s Gaza sanctions are similar to other international sanctions with the desired end-result of regime change such as economic sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s and Iran today. Ask yourself why economic sanctions would result in regime change…It’s self-evident that the purpose is to force the population to turn against their own government when the suffering becomes too great for them to bear. That’s why, as I said previously, Israel considers the act of attempting to alleviate suffering in Gaza by delivering donations of food, clothes, and construction materials to be a capital offense punishable by death, because according to the logic of the sanctions, alleviating suffering abets the Hamas government and interferes with the Israeli campaign against them.</p>

<p>That’s definitely true, but its not just limited to eyewitnesses; a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> of media outlets take an extremely biased view of the situation; that means that definitive answers are hard to find. Both sides have motives for manipulating the evidence; Israel because bad press is bad, and the protesters because good press is good.</p>
<p>Given that, I tried to use physical evidence, such as the videos and pictures of the attack, as the bulk of the evidence; there’s a lot in there that can’t be reconciled with the protester’s evidence. But equally there’s a lot of pictures that can’t be readily reconciled with Israel’s point of view; there are no real weapons shown, and while there are bullet-proof vests, the biggest weapon there is a sword. Not guns or anything else.</p>

</aside>
<p>I thought that you were indicating some more malicious intent on Israel’s part. I think that the point of economic sanctions isn’t just to force the local populace to change governments, since that’s <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> going to happen in North Korea and other totalitarian states; its also to cut off supplies the regime needs to achieve its destructive ends. Making sure Hamas doesn’t get more weapons is more important to Israel’s security than getting a long-term solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict.</p>
<p>But, given that you’re right in at least one branch of the analysis, why is that a bad thing? The US uses sanctions all the time to try to get regime changes, even where those sanctions result in massive humanitarian crises, and yet they still do it. Why is it intrinsically bad for Israel to try to force the Gazans to elect a non-violent governing body that they can have lasting relations with? Realistically, Hamas stepping down from using violent means is the <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> way we’re going to get a resolution in Palestine, so isn’t bringing that goal about justified? Moreover, the blockade has been used in the past to a reasonable level of effect, and doesn’t that mean that its a good tool? If not a ‘good’ tool, then at least the least worst one?</p>
<p>I’m not going to deny the situation is fairly dire, I’m just saying that if you look at the West Bank, where there is the peaceful Fatah and (reasonably) good relations with Israel, there’s no sanctions. Israel isn’t targeting the Gazans because they’re Palestinians; they’re targeting them because they reasonably believe that removing the blockade would do more harm than good.</p>

<p>Collective punishment is intrinsically bad because<br>
A) It’s <span class="bbcode-b">self-evidently undemocratic</span> for outside parties to “force” a population to elect a government which said parties determine to be acceptable, and punish them when they determine the democratic outcome to be unacceptable.<br>
B It’s <span class="bbcode-b">illegal under Geneva </span>to punish a civilian population for the actions of a military force operating in their territory and<br>
C) It’s <span class="bbcode-b">never been shown to work</span> (Iraq? Iran? N. Korea? Venezuela? Cuba?), and is based on the incredibly naive idea that the population will blame their own government rather than the parties who are enforcing the sanctions.</p>
<p>Correlating with point C, Likud’s policies are <span class="bbcode-b">blatantly counterproductive</span> to Israel’s interests, since the more the population is radicalized, the more they tend to support Hamas. If the situation in Gaza were normalized, there would be zero popular support for government by a paramilitary organization, but as they are living under a constant state of siege it only makes sense to support a military government.</p>

<p>The implication was that Americans agreed with what was going on in Gitmo.  I explained that there are many Americans that did not.  Right now, the American Government and the Americans are two different entities and, it is my not-so-humble opinion that what has caused this is at least a generation’s worth of systemic attacks on the government, culminating in Reagan’s famous “I’ve always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help’.”</p>
<p>They have alienated “We the People” from the government and then are dumbfounded when the “government” doesn’t do what “We the People” want.  And now, “We the People” are so uneducated and arrogant in their ignorance that this schism is becoming self-perpetuating.</p>
<p>I’ve always felt the four most terrifying words in the English language are “Government is the problem”.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While it is undemocratic for the US to impose sanctions on various countries around the world, it still does it. It still funds the Saudi government even though that’s fundamentally undemocratic. Why? Because its interests outweigh the general concept of ‘democracy’. In instances where a violation of this general tenant of democracy is necessary to save lives, doesn’t that make it worth it?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While I agree that taking military action against the civilians is illegal under Geneva, in the case of Gaza they’re not really two separate things. The populace elected Hamas; Hamas does what it does with a mandate from the people. If it was a totalitarian dictatorship, like in North Korea, I would have more sympathy. I’m not saying I don’t understand where they’re coming from, because I do, and I have grave reservations about Israel and what’s its doing in the region, but to say that you can’t punish a civilian population for what it is vicariously doing seems…contradictory…at best.</p>
<p>The problem with <span class="bbcode-i">war</span> as it exists today is that war no longer concerns one small part of the country; it necessarily involves the entire populace. During war, the economy, societal structure and government are all geared towards war. With Gaza the concept is taken even further so that every single person is involved in the conflict; from kids who throw rocks at tanks to people who fire mortars into Israel and those who vote for Hamas.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well with any of the aforementioned examples, they weren’t all done for the same reason. Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea was done to restrain Communism. Iraq and Iran were done to restrain the abilities of the dictators to wage war in the interests of maintaining US resource security, in an attempt to ‘starve out’ both of the governments. While many of them have been unsuccessful in changing the government (in fact, only South Africa comes to mind, and that’s not a perfect example either), they’re good for two reasons other than eliciting organic change within the country; they politically isolate the country and stop them from getting weapons.</p>

<p>Correlating with point C, Likud’s policies are <span class="bbcode-b">blatantly counterproductive</span> to Israel’s interests, since the more the population is radicalized, the more they tend to support Hamas. If the situation in Gaza were normalized, there would be zero popular support for government by a paramilitary organization, but as they are living under a constant state of siege it only makes sense to support a military government.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree, and the way the sanctions work supported that goal. The sanctions were reduced in accordance with a reduction in mortar attacks. It was aimed at restoring faith in the peace process. However, the process collapsed when Gaza recommenced rocket attacks.</p>

<p>I wasn’t so much talking about <span class="bbcode-i">mass</span> opinion, just the opinion of Gitmo supporters. Those who supported the camp always painted the terrorists as ‘evil’ and thereby justified their acts. Its the same with Israel; it depends on where you stand as how you interpret the facts.</p>
