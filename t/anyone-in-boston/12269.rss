            <p>What I dont understand is why everyone cares so much that they where Muslim. Retarded Christians just go “HA PEACEFUL RELIGION HUH OBAMA WELL DIS PROVE DAT UR A MUSLIM AND ALL MUSLIMS KILL AND EAT BABIES” Everytime a Christian does something horrible they respond with “oh well dem where not rlly christians just crazy people”</p>
<p>I wish people would just stop using someones religion as an explanation of what someone did. A person is responsible for their own actions and that is it.</p>

<p>I’m sketchy on details. Today it’s minor wounds from the shrapnel. My family sucks at sharing information, and I don’t have much in the way of contacting those in Boston.</p>
<p>I’d go with the minor shrapnel wounds over burns, I’ve heard the same thing about the bombs.</p>

</aside>
<p>Depends on the type of bomb you’re dealing with. Incendiaries, such as Napalm, can cause firestorms (and therefore burns).</p>
<p>Really the only thing a bomb is, is just a shitload of air pressure waiting to be set off. Shrapnel is really just the object(s) it obliterates (or knocks out of its way) initially and it turns them into projectiles.</p>
<p>Edit: There’s a shitload of conspiracy theories flying around now… sometimes I hate my fellow country men… fuckin’ stupid.</p>

<p>Oh. How close was he to where the bombs went off? How bad was his injury?</p>

</aside>
<p>He was rather close I believe. But the explosion only burned up his right leg and side. He’s already home, so that’s nice. Course, it’s my opinion that whoever is responsible should be turned over to a couple of good ol’ Boston boys. They won’t let the person or people responsible die quickly. They’ll suffer.</p>

<p>I’m glad they got him alive. He probably doesn’t know everything but hopefully he can at least give us some information on why him and his brother did this. I try not to be prejudiced like this but it did end up being someone who practices Islam (as well as a Chechen). I know that it’s not the whole religion that’s like this but a lot of people are making it difficult to not see the religion as bad.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just sayin’, you should Judge whether or not a religion is bad/violent based on its teachings, not the actions of its professed followers. Having said that I have heard the case made both ways as to whether or not Islam’s teachings in the Qur’an/Hadith condone violent Jihad. Personally I don’t know enough about Islam to have a justifiable viewpoint on this.</p>
