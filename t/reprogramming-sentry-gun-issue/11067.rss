edit - It hits me 2/3 times whilst I&#39;m holding the sentry, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m in the cone of fire, because I&#39;m holding the sentry from behind</description>

<p>You can reprogram turrets?!</p>

</aside>
<p>well, I called it that mainly cause of the achievement, if you pick them up they will shoot everything including marines, I think anyway</p>
<p>edit - Tactics</p>
<p>Except for its 360° rotating gun, the sentry doesn’t move, so looking for a way around to avoid crossing its line of sight is a good move. Also, it is possible to damage the sentry with conventional weapons or even knocking it over with another physics object [2].<br>
If the player manages to close enough to a turret to grab it with the use key, Gordon will pick it up and reprogram it so it shoots every living thing in front of it, including HECU Marines, enabling the player to use it as an improvised weapon.</p>

<p>I realize that very well. Yet, why reinvent the wheel? Bug trackers already exist, and “scripting” one upon the forum would just be waste of time, especially when the transfer from the forum to the bug tracker can be automatized (I’m doing it by hand 'cause I don’t have the rights to do otherwise, and ONLY for that).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>By script I did not mean a script you click or run each time a post or thread is made.</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn’t have written “script”.</p>
<hr>
<p>A monitoring program is usually running 24/7 on the server, which is why it is a “monitoring program” - it monitors, stores and evaluates new data - <span class="bbcode-b">fully automated!</span>.</p>
<p>Some programs even store their information in Excel sheets (thread name, posted by, date, getpos coordinates, map name, file name, file location, MDMP crash report files, etc.), making it relatively easy for the person who is responsible for re-producing, then passing over the issue / bug / exploit / ecetera.</p>
<p>Mostly you have a user-interface application, which is given to all the developers - said program can access the database the previously mentioned software stores its information into.</p>
<p>But still, all the ‘<span class="bbcode-i">fuzz</span>’ about a monitoring software and such could be very well false - maybe the team doesn’t even use such things (yet) - who knows.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the advantages over a standard forum (like this one), that I can see, would be the fact that users themselves would be able to see if the bug they are about to open a new thread about, has already been posted and thus prevents them from creating duplicate reports.</p>
<p>In some cases users just don’t use the search feature of a forum, or even bother about using it, since the fastest and easiest way of getting help seems to be submitting an entirely new thread and adding it to the three (3) that described (and maybe even solved!) the exact same issue, about two (2) days ago.</p>
<hr>
<p>Again, no offense intended!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now, back to the topic, please (if you want to discuss the matter any further, please send me a PM about it. Thank you.)…</p>

</aside>
<p>The devs aren’t stupid, but I guess that after spending so many years on this project, they might want to stand back a little.</p>
<p>Also, as another user already pointed out, they didn’t use a bug tracker yet, apparently because they underestimated the number of incoming reports.</p>
<p>It’s not my intention to insult the fan base at all, but from what I’ve seen while reporting all these bugs, I’ve seen a couple of trolls and flaming (to say the least). So, okay, I was pissed and said “most of” instead of “some of”, I recognize it. Yet I wasn’t pissed off for nothing : I know what I am doing, thank you very much.</p>
<p>And I, like you all, am doing my best to help BMS developers. That is, I, unlike you all, am doing it in a usual (in the IT world) fashion, the way other developers do it.</p>

<p>They could very well have a monitoring program in place, which records and evaluates each thread and post that is made, adding the information to different lists and databases.</p>
<p>The stored information can then be used by a developer in a means to assure higher quality by fixing the exploit, bug, ecetera.</p>
<p>Usually the scenario is re-created, according to the users description, then passed over to one of the responsible team members, which then attempts to fix the issue, if it occurs in a certain manner.</p>
<p>Which is why there are people who solely focus on quality assurance.</p>
<p>Said people sometimes even have a program or software for that.</p>
<p>No offense intended!</p>

            <p>I’m not stupid. I know that most users aren’t even able to read a single line of code, and are too lazy to read more than two lines on wikipedia.</p>
<p>I know that you still doubt the reason why I do so. I also know that if you took the time to actually SEARCH the forum for references about this, you would have found that I’m not the only one that think that a bug tracker WILL actually HELP solving bugs. I may not have the agreement from every single black mesa developer, right.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I start to find most users on this forum pretty pedantic, and I could also stop trying to help, remove any efforts I have done already and let you all “help” the developers by adding your own personal unique (yet many times duplicated) bug to the freaking overbloated heap of crap which is this part of the forum.</p>

            <p>lol thx, can’t catch them all! I thought if you were holding one, that its cone of vision shouldn’t include you, especially if your not up against any objects.<br>
I did a search for sentry and bug, but didn’t see anything posted, didn’t realize it was already posted sry.</p>

            <p>That is commonly known, already.</p>
<p>Although, I’m not quite sure if it is or was intentional.</p>
<p>Picking up a sentry does not reprogram them, apparently - which is why they shoot anything that moves (including you, the player)…</p>

<p>You’ve got a typo in the title “Chaper”, by the way.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
