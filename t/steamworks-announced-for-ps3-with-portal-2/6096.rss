    <title>Steamworks announced for PS3 with Portal 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steamworks-announced-for-ps3-with-portal-2/6096</link>
    <description>Valve will update it&#39;s current titles and perhaps bring new ones with steamworks support for the PS3.... If black mesa will be available through steam would / could it recieve a port to the PS3 using an updated Orange Box Engine?

I think this could make this Mod even more amazing if it was to migrate to consoles too!! And be free hmmmm....costs money to do but is it a possibility?</description>

            <p>I agree with Maxey, Valve is probably only going to add steamworks on PS3. Its highly unlikely steam will be on PS3.</p>

            <p>The only thing I can see Steamworks bringing to the PS3 is Cloud support, because the PS3 itself has friends and auto-updating.</p>

            <p>Nope. No Black Mesa for consoles. I thought steamworks for PS3 actually only includes quick updating and steam cloud to save savegames. No modsupport I guess.</p>
