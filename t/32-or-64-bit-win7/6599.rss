    <title>32 or 64 bit win7?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/32-or-64-bit-win7/6599</link>
    <description>i recently bought a 2nd hardrive and on it i will instal windows7
(the other drive still has a vista instaltion that id like to keep as i dont want to loose my files)

but after some reseach i found out that my pc has AMD x64 core&#39;s they can run both 32 and 64 bit content, sofar i always had a 32 bit windows vista

so i am now in the opertunity to instal windows 7 64 bit but i wonder does it realy help ?
i know that whit the bits it is posable to adress more RAM but i only have 3 gig ram in my pc, witch makes me wonder if instal 64 id still only have 3gig so it wont benefit or would it ?

so is it worth it installing a 64 bit os on a pc that only has 3gig of ram ? or should i upgrade my ram past the 3gig before it gets better ?</description>

<p>The difference between 64 and 32 won’t really be noticeable with 3gb you have.<br>
64 can access a bit more memory, and I guess it would sound cooler to say that you have 64 bit…</p>
<p>…soo … 64 bit<br>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">Cause4concern:</span> Microsoft has been supporting a CPU based memory management feature called PAE (Physical Address Extension) since XP/2000. It lets you use more than 4 GB of memory by mapping upper memory addresses into the main 4 GB address space. These “windows” or “pages” are mapable separately by each process, so your software can use a good chunk of your RAM, just not all to a single process. 64 bit addressing is much more stable (some 32 bit software does not like PAE at all), and all of it is available to any single process, if necessary.*</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Is there not some sort of limit to the amount of RAM individual applications can use in a 32 bit OS? I could find the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64_bit" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>:<br>
“Some operating systems reserve portions of process address space for OS use, effectively reducing the total address space available for mapping memory for user programs. For instance, Windows XP DLLs and other user mode OS components are mapped into each process’s address space, leaving only 2 to 3 GB (depending on the settings) address space available. This limit is currently much higher on 64-bit operating systems and does not realistically restrict memory usage.”</p>
<p>I once knew someone who bought a laptop with 4GB of RAM and 1GB dedicated video memory which had 32 bit Vista. I thought this was odd but I later read that there are 32 bit versions of Ubuntu with some sort of memory address extensions (or something like that) which allows for more than 4GB of RAM. This made me wonder if 32 bit Vista (or Windows 7) has this modification.</p>

            <p>Everything that needed to be said was pretty much said, but I guess it wouldn’t hurt to break it down into what i feel are the most important factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">16 bit application support</span>. If you have any 16 bit programs, they will work on a 32 bit version of windows, but not on a 64 bit version unless you’re willing to run a virtual machine.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">support for more RAM</span>. I know you have 3gb now, but if you ever decide to upgrade (which may be sooner than you might think), you won’t be able to use more on a 32 bit version.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">64 bit application support</span>. This isn’t that big a deal right now since most apps that are written for 64 bit versions of windows also have a 32 bit version, but 64 bit applications that take advantage of 64 bit hardware <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/forum/250205-28-performance" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">run a bit faster</a>.</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">e-peen size</span>. if you have 32 bit windows on a 64 bit platform, you have none.</li>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>That shouldn’t be a problem, Windows 7 and Vista uses the same core meaning any driver that work on Vista, is almost guaranteed to work on Windows 7 too.</p>
<p>We all used Vista drivers on the early versions of Windows 7 before any official Windows 7 compatible drivers were released.</p>
<p>Regarding speed (correct me if i am wrong):</p>
<p>32 and 64 bit CPUs should be equal in speed.</p>
<p>64 bit Windows may seem slow if you run 32 bit programs on it.<br>
Because all the instructions has to go through WOW64 first.<br>
Instead of running directly on the hardware.<br>
So the games compiled for 32 bit might run a tiny bit slower on 64 bit.</p>
<p>So as long as you run 64 bit apps on 64 bit Windows it should not be slower.</p>
<p>32 bit Windows/CPUs can not work with 64 bit numbers natively, so it may need to combine 2x 32 bit registers in order to simulate a single 64 bit register.<br>
I’m not entirely sure about the last one here but that might make 32 bit Windows slower.</p>
<p>No matter what, 64 bit IS the future so we better get used to it.</p>

<p>thank you for the answer,</p>
<p>i wanted o keep windows vista incase some of aplication and thing will not run on windows 7, for exampel windows 7 does not contain any drivers for my USB WLAN stick so if i had remvoed windows vista i would not even be able to go the internet at all  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

</aside>
<p>I work in IT and also have lots of experience building my own PCs and for other people and from my experience 32bit and 64 bit Windows 7 both run about the same speed on the same hardware - any difference would be negligible unless you have over 4 Gbs RAM, and even then you won’t notice much difference day to day, apart from in high end applications and some very demanding games.</p>
<p>All that’s really different about 64bit operating systems is that they can access a larger amount of memory.</p>
<p>A few bits of software might not be 64bit compatible, especially older apps and games, but most will run. (I’m currently playing an old game from 1999 called Outcast on my Core i7 with Windows 7 64bit without any problems!).</p>
<p>The only thing that people might have problems with is hardware drivers - if there are not 64bit versions of drivers for your hardware then it might not work. I’d check first, especially if you have older hardware. I’m not just talking about your PC, but things like printers and scanners as well.</p>
<p>I would say that it might be more futureproof to get Windows 7 64bit, because when you do upgrade your memory, or get a new PC and want to transfer it across (depending on your license and whether the new PC comes with an OS already or not of course - by then, Windows 8 perhaps?), it will be able to take advantage of the extra RAM. If you have any doubts about the compatibility of the software or hardware you’ve got, then stick with 32bit.</p>
<p>But I would question why you want to have keep both Vista :meh: and Windows 7  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ?

            <p>Use 64-bit. I used to use 32, I went very slow compared to 64.</p>

            <p>I don’t call bullshit, I’m well aware that may be true…the point is that the article is 2 years old.</p>
<p>I’m running 64bit, I’d suggest it.</p>

            <p>Yup, got Win 7 32 bit, and it only detects 3GB out of my 4… soon I’ll switch for a Win 7 64bit.</p>

            <p>The biggest noticeable difference is the memory cap of windows 7 32-bit. 32-bit won’t recognize any amount of memory higher than 3-3.5 gb (same thing vista did). if you’re running more than that, use 64-bit.</p>

<p>A test I’ve read 2 years ago on Toms Hardware Guide. Also, 64 bit os uses more memory on harddisk and ram. But I would still recommend 64 bit os. You can’t really feel the difference between 32 bit and 8gb of ddr3 ram only costs you 60€ to 80€ so I would go for it.</p>

<p>64 bit is generally slower. At a minimum of 8gb it gets a little bit faster.</p>

<p>I call bullshit, but I have 8 GB anyway so I don’t care.</p>

            <p>go for 7 64bit, if you had 2gb of ram I would say go for XP 32bit, if you have any old software to install, download virtualBox and install XP in there.</p>

<p>2 years is a long time in the world of computers and as for the 64bit taking more space well the difference is really kinda negligible considering how cheap hard drives are today</p>
