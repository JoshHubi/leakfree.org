    <title>Power up not starting</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/power-up-not-starting/10138</link>
    <description>So after defeating the tentacle, I meander down to the ladder, and make my way down, there is a Load indicator, however when I make my way to the bottom of the ladder, it collapses, yet nothing happens afterwards. I can jump down, explore the area, water and all, pick up the ammo as well.
The 1 door down there is red, and will not work, and no amount of swimming has produced a path either. I have tried this 4 times now to see if something is amiss, no idea what is up.

And you guys absolutely rock. This has brought back some epic memories, and great additions to the game. Awesome music and gameplay.</description>

<p>Thanks Daft, going to check now.<br>
And from what I had read before I posted, this appeared to be a bug, only reason I posted it in here.</p>
