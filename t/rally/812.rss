    <description>Anyone else loves this sport? Personally I do! I follow as much as I can on [url=&#39;https://www.wrc.com&#39;]wrc.com[/url]. Who do you guys think will win the Rally Poland this year? Anyone else is saddened by the fact that good manufacturers like Subaru and Mitsubishi are going out of European rally?

            <p>I am very lucky to have a rally go right past my house twice a year <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It usually rains and it’s usually very cold, but who cares when you can be a few centimeters from rally cars without having to go anywhere.</p>

            <p>You can call me a huge motoring fan. Love WRC, Le Mans, Motocross and F1 (although as stated before, there are too much guys with laptops regarding the last one).</p>
<p>Also, regarding Ken Block:<br>
This vid sums up the amount of badass within those people who do rallying (and motocross).<br>

<p>As for Poland 2009, my bet is on Citroens. Don’t ask why.</p>

            <p>I sometimes go down to wales to do some amatuer rallying, in a stripped out 2.0 ford focus! : D</p>
<p>I also like F1. Although that becomes to tidus and races seem now to be won and last in the board room.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah I saw the second one a couple of weeks ago. Ken Block is amazing. It’s no wonder why he’s the new consultant for the Colin McRae series.</p>
<p>I wish he’d do more European rally tho.</p>

<p>What takes more balls? Running around a pitch with a load of faggots with a ball in your hand, or having the back end of your car step out slighly while sliding round a corner at 60MPH+ with trees as the crash barriers?</p>
<p>That heart stopping moment when you reliase the rear tyres have lost all grip is terrifying, but its also awesome, and the feeling when you regain controll is even better!</p>

            <p>I know you’re trolling, but I’m gonna answer you intelligently: Rally <span class="bbcode-u">is</span> a real sport. A real motorsport. I also love some ball sports like Football, or soccer if you prefer, and Hockey, but I find Basketball boring as hell. Never found something interesting in it, although I respect the people who do. Same thing goes for American football, baseball, lacrosse or any other ball sport. But I also like Cycling, and I watch the “<span class="bbcode-i">Tour De France</span>” every year. I also like Parkour but some people don’t consider it a sport.</p>
<p>Now, why do I prefer rally to other motorsports? Because it’s the man versus the wild. You only win if you’re a good driver, or a crazy driver like Colin McRae, or Colin MCrash like some call him. I like Rally because these drivers aren’t sissies. If a wheel screw up, they continue and don’t just call the team so they can be picked up. They got the front-right wheel on fire? Not a problem! It’ll probably extinguish itself anyway.</p>
<p>I also like Rally for the fans. You often see a driver being helped by supporters on the side of the road. I once saw a driver, I think it was Hirvonen, who got his from bumper blocking one on the front wheels. Some guys came, ripped off the bumper and turned the car into the road so he could continue.</p>
<p>That’s why I prefer Rally to other sports.</p>
<p>tl;dr? Well screw you, if you’re too lazy to read I’m too lazy to make you a summary.[/SIZE]</p>
