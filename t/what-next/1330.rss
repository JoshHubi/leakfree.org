    <description>Just an odd question. I&#39;ve finished Half Life and Half-Life 2 and its episodes. I was considering moving on to Opposing Force, Blue Shift, or Decay... but I wasn&#39;t sure which to visit first, or if it was worth even playing these games after Half Life.

Any recommendations?</description>

            <p>The tone of G-man and Minerva seem too different to me to be the same being. Personally I feel Minerva is a female entity too, which G-man couldn’t be otherwise he would have chosen a female ‘form’ to present himself. Minerva is also very expressive, while the G-Man leaves thoughts incomplete and deliberately vauge.</p>
<p>It’s clear there are higher powers out there that don’t make themselves obvious to humankind. G-Man and the Combine are the strongest examples of this, the former evoking his ‘employers’ and the latter being represented directly only in the shape of the ‘advisors’ (not directors or overseers). I’d like to play “Someplace else” to find out more about Minerva, but I have the feeling she’s another one of these ‘mysterious benefactors’ on the level of G-Man and his employers, but a different entity from them.</p>

</aside>
<p>I always thought Minerva WAS Gman still giving you instructions. Just that since Shephard was a soldier and used to taking orders, Gman was willing to be more direct about giving instructions, instead of being vague and mystical like he was with Gordon, who showed the ability to work better when he had to find his own direction.</p>

</aside>
<p>Since Adam Foster was hired by VALVe and released statements say they have no plans for Adrian’s character, it would kill two birds with one stone to retcon Minerva’s lab-rat into really being Adrian. There are implied reasons why Minerva conscripted the player and maybe those reasons would involve surviving Black Mesa.</p>
<p>I wonder if this should warrant its own thread since I think there’s discussion value to be had about if it fits or not.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well, I decided on getting Op4 first.</p>
<p>It feels as if something half-life was missing from the game, though I can’t quite place it. It was neat to encounter/fight the Race-X aliens, though it felt like Shephard was taking on this force while the Xen aliens had more of a cameo appearance. It completes the puzzle about what happened to Black Mesa though, justifying itself as a ‘part 2’ of how the disaster was resolved. It was also really cool to visit some of the locations in half life and see Gordon take the plunge in the reactor (Yes, I followed him for the Temporal Paradox ending when I first saw it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  )</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t care much for was babysitting the grunts. Half-Life may have been praised for its AI strengths, but I didn’t see it in the version I played. Unless I was staring at the Marines, I’d loose some of them when walking anywhere. Getting them to follow their scripted scenes to move on in the storyline was bothersome too, for the reason that they’d have a hard time following me.</p>
<p>In the end, I wasn’t given the same feeling that I had when playing Episode 2, which made me want to play it again for the fun of it (depsite the ugh strider battle at the end and the headache of transporting that gnome to the rocket cone). It was fun to play once, but I don’t have a strong urge to play it again.</p>
<p>Playing this off the heels of the Minerva Mod, It made me wonder if Minerva’s ‘Perseus’ is actually Shephard. Maybe it’s for another thread, but I think Shephard ‘waking up’ from the life of a Combine soldier would be a neat way to get him back into the story.</p>

<p>Ahh yeah, that’s a fair point. I think the first time I played through that I was <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> low on ammunition, so I think the tension overcame the repetition. Now you mention it, I remember being a bit annoyed in my second run through.</p>
<p>That probably settles it then. Blue Shift is a good-quality game, but if the two are the same price then you’ll get more out of your money with Opposing Force. OF has a better ending, one to rival HL’s in my opinion. Save BS until you can/want to afford it.</p>

<p>Well, I was playing the part where you’re running around the maintenance tunnels just past the sewers, filled with FUCKING headcrabs and FUCKING Vortigaunts and the occasional FUCKING bullsquid. It became really really really irritating when every box, crate or panel had a bloody headcrab behind it. Blue Shift just doesn’t seem to have enough variation overall. Half-Life was like; Headcrab, Zombie, Vortigaunt, Vortigaunt, Bullsquid, Headcrab, Zombie, Grunt, Zombie, Grunt, Headcrab, Vortigaunt… and Blue Shift is like Headcrab, Headcrab, Headcrab, Headcrab, Vortigaunt, Vortigaunt, Vortigaunt, Headcrab, Headcrab, Grunt, Grunt, Grunt, Grunt, Grunt, Grunt, Headcrab, Headcrab, Headcrab, Vortigaunt, Vortigaunt, OMG ALIEN GRUNT ^_^.</p>
<p>I hope I made my own opinion clear.</p>
<p>Blue Shift is fun the first time and you should play it… it’s just if you know what you’re doing little things like that^ become extremely annoying.</p>

<p>Blue Shift is darker, more honed and of a better quality in my opinion. It’s more focussed on puzzles and atmosphere and provides a more cinematic experience. It’s shorter than OF, but to me it felt <span class="bbcode-i">much</span> much longer than it was in actuality. I think the reasoning behind that was that I felt so much more involved and tensed when playing, so that something that I breezed through in five minutes the second playthrough felt like half an hour.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s true BS is more polished and immersive than OP4 but I totally disagree about the lenght since 1/3 of game maps are the same. It gives not the déjà vu feeling which could be fun but a repetitive gameplay. Since it’s not very long, that’s a bit disapointing.</p>

            <p>good point. Blue shift felt like a more cohesive part of the Half Life universe, but overall fairly short, and the ending left a little to be desired. Opposing Force felt bigger, more dramatic ending, but felt like it was pretty much all combat and not much else. I know there was more both of them than that, but it’s been a while since I’ve played them both.</p>

<p>Actually my concern was which of the games was the most satisfying to play. I’ve heard Blue Shift is the shortest of the three, for example, and I don’t want a game that’s Portal in length unless it’s as good as Portal</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s all down to personal taste. I thought that Blue Shift was better than OF and HL in terms of atmosphere and mood (which is what I enjoy in games, next to story and gameplay). It felt honed, and was of a better quality than the previous Gold Source games overall. It’s darker than Half-Life and tougher than it as well in my opinion. The set designs, lighting, maps and gameplay are all superbly set out, and feel as though they’ve been refined to perfection. Its Xen levels are of a <span class="bbcode-i">far</span> better quality than Half-Life’s as well, and I really enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Opposing Force, although still incredible, felt a little convoluted. It seemed to give the impression that it was attempting to go all out and over the top with a new species of aliens, new weapons, new enemies, new allies and new gameplay elements, so combined with the existing ones, something about it felt needlessy complicated. It was still good though, and gameplay-wise I thought it was the toughest and also the most epic of the three. I’d say it was about HL2’s length, which is shorter than Half-Life.</p>
<p>So it really depends on what you want. Opposing Force is enjoyable and nice and long, if a little convoluted perhaps. It’s perfect if you’re simply after gameplay and enjoyment I’d say.</p>
<p>Blue Shift is darker, more honed and of a better quality in my opinion. It’s more focussed on puzzles and atmosphere and provides a more cinematic experience. It’s shorter than OF, but to me it felt <span class="bbcode-i">much</span> much longer than it was in actuality. I think the reasoning behind that was that I felt so much more involved and tensed when playing, so that something that I breezed through in five minutes the second playthrough felt like half an hour.</p>

            <p>The PC version of decay isn’t dodgy, it’s the only way worth playing it. It’s also free if you already have HL.</p>
<p>Seriously, if you’re that short on cash, start hitting up moddb and planet phillip to find some mods. they are FREEEEEE.</p>

            <p>If you get the original HL, go get the “WTF MESSUP MOD” because it’s really funny. It’s the original HL’s first few levels (just Black Mesa), but everything is hilariously screwed up. For example, the first level you can run around in is called “To Distroy The World”, and pressing the receptionist guard’s button makes gibs rain on him.</p>

            <p>Blue Shift isn’t as good as Portal, but it’s definitely worth $5. The steam version is buggy as hell, but you can either noclip through the buggy parts or download BS: unlocked, for a patched version. It’s a third party mod that requires the Steam version of Blue Shift.</p>

<p>Like I said, no offense intended :3</p>
<p>In that case… go for Opposing Force.</p>
