    <title>The Steam widget-thingy on posts?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-steam-widget-thingy-on-posts/9456</link>
    <description>I just joined, as you can see, and I&#39;ve seen people with the Steam widget-thingy showing their Steam name/what game they&#39;re playing, and I can&#39;t seem to get that to work. It shows the completely wrong person... I&#39;ve tried different usernames, etc.  Yes, I put my Steam name on my profile. 

Can anybody help me? *stupidface*</description>
