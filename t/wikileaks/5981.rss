    <description>In case you&#39;ve been living under a rock, Wikileaks is a website that uploads leaked information, mostly classified sensitive or secret, from 3rd party sources on the web. It is worth noting that none of that latest releases that have cause the media firestorm were classified top secret.

There have been discussions going on in the political front recently, mostly in the conservative party, about whether to classify the website as a terrorist organization for these releases, and it&#39;s founder as a terrorist.

There are arguments being made both for and against Wikileaks and I&#39;d like to hear some opinions. I&#39;ll put in my bit to get started.

I think branding the organization as a terrorist one is far too extreme, as is branding Julian a terrorist and digging up dirt on the guy just to get him into custody.

1. The media would have us believe this guy is guilty of rape, but to make this clear, the allegation is that his condom broke during sex and he knew about it and decided not to tell his partner. Not only are they simply assuming he did this knowingly, but the charges came forward only after these women were dug up and interrogated. Not just that, but INTERPOL? For a condom? Come on.

2. The guy is only in trouble now because he ruffled the wrong feathers. He received international praise when he exposed extrajudicial assassinations and corruption in Kenya. A little fingerprint lifting by the United States is disclosed and everyone flips a lid and wants this guy dead.

3. Finally theres the rational part of my brain that says we SHOULD know what our own government is doing about foreign relations, especially after that last presidency. If we&#39;re calling the Prime Minister of France a thin skinned authoritarian, I want to know. If we&#39;re gunning down civilians from helicopters, I want to know. I should know when my government decides to steal biometric data from UN members. My reason says that if we&#39;re not doing anything wrong then we don&#39;t have anything to hide.

I can probably think of a few exceptions, but nothing that has been published on Wikileaks. Anyway... two cents? Anyone?</description>

            <p>According to media: Norwegian government is terrified for wikileaks because:</p>

<p>I get I expressed badly when I said the current system is perfect.</p>
<p>The problem is not the system. Any system might work or fail, failure has nothing to do with republic, democratic, socialist, etc. The key, ladies and gentlemen, is humans. The problems have names and addresses. Whoever is in charge, I don’t care, but I do care about what this person does there.</p>
<p>The best thing about this internet war is that we are teaching them a lesson: they don’t have the power. I already said this.</p>

<p>What? Less than a sixth of one percent of the american population people support something? No!</p>

<p>Yes, in one day, without appearing on the TV, no posters with ladies in bikini about the site… the only kind of propaganda is the one that people themselves are spreading. If people are spreading, it means they care. In two days, half of a million people? That <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> a lot of people.</p>

<p>In any case, until a solution is provided, your complaints are worthlessly idealist. Feel free to complain, but it means nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I am not a idealist and you are stubborn. How many times do I have to say: I don’t have the answer. Idealists are the ones that have answers, you have answers, not me.</p>
<p>Don’t you see that theorizing the best system simply does not work? Imagine everyone talking about one’s own idea. <span class="bbcode-b">Theory does not work in humanity!</span> What works is small changes to solve the problems that appear as they appear. Solving one problem at a time, we can slowly find the best solution for everyone.</p>
<p>Haven’t you seen History? Humans and more humans proposing so many perfect systems, they seemed so beautiful on paper, why did none of those work? Because they were perfect <span class="bbcode-b">on paper</span>! Therefore, stop looking for someone to present a perfect solution to substitute the entire system. That is impossible.</p>
<p>Now, you are suggesting that we stay still while they do whatever they want? Using political pressure to oppress freedom? Forget it, I won’t stay still. Staying still does not solve problems, instead it creates problems. If you want to deal with problems, face them! Don’t hide from them, they won’t disappear automatically.</p>
<p>If you want the solution, here it is: you observe, see what is the problem, you think a lot about the problem and then you do something. Then you think about what you did and wait for it to have effect. It requires patience. Don’t try to find a solution for everything, that is impossible, you have to take small steps fighting one problem at a time, one day at a time. The fighting has only began, don’t demand me to say how it is going to end, I’m not God!</p>
<p>Bradley had the courage of a lion to steal most of Wikileaks’ documents, he is in jail in the US and might even get killed for what he did. Assange had the courage to publish those documents. So, for God’s sake, grow some balls!</p>

</aside>
<p>Wikileaks is like anything else in the press, they are allowed to receive stolen information, that is predicted in law. Wikileaks is just an online newspaper.</p>
<p>And stop giving so much credit to law, they are created by man. Unless you prove that they are harming people. And, believe me, if they end up harming people, even unintentionally, that will be used by their enemies like hell, so you don’t even have to bother looking for dangerous leaked information.</p>

<p>Reaganomics/“trickle-down” “voodoo economics” is a bankrupt economic theory (pun partially intended); as is Friedmanism.  Keynesianism, which we haven’t had for DECADES, is the solution.

<p>Abraham Lincoln proclaimed that it was a government OF, BY, and FOR “the people”.  A government of, by, and for politicians or business is not American at all.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>How does that solve the problem? Also, never reference Abe Lincoln in reference to people’s rights when it comes to the health of the nation. Its not smart.</p>

            <p>They, being the military, willingly handed him the documents that’s the difference. I hope you know they haven’t published anything which has been a threat to national security, all names that have been published have not been harmed as a consequence. And I’m sure they know that publishing anything that <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> a threat that they <span class="bbcode-i">will</span> be hunted down like they did with Assange.</p>
<p>So at the moment <span class="bbcode-i">direct</span> harm to national security is not a threat that Wikileaks imposes.</p>

<p>The Espionage Act does not apply to this situation.</p>
<p>Nor this.</p>
<p>Reaganomics/“trickle-down” “voodoo economics” is a bankrupt economic theory (pun partially intended); as is Friedmanism.  Keynesianism, which we haven’t had for DECADES, is the solution.  Call me a communist, call me a socialist, call me a pie-in-the-sky, doe-eyed idealist…I don’t give a shit.  And, by extension, the government.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, the United States government (the best kind of governance there is) relies on an educated populace.  If you hide things from people under the banner of “national security” that…well…<span class="bbcode-i">isn’t</span>, you don’t have an educated populace.  You have corruption.  I don’t care if it’s a Democrat, a Republican, an Independent, a communist, a socialist, a capitalist, a fascist or anything else.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln proclaimed that it was a government OF, BY, and FOR “the people”.  A government of, by, and for politicians or business is not American at all.</p>

<p>How does the Espionage Act not apply? We don’t know exactly if any of the leaked documents are a threat to national security or interferes with any military action.</p>
<p>Also, any documents of diplomats are inviolable, how does this not apply to any documents leaked. And what about him receiving stolen goods? I saw no reply to that.</p>

<p>The system we have IS the right system. And we need to maintain freedom of the press just as we always have and rely on journalists to expose corruption and immorality in government.</p>
