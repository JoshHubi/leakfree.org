            <p>Steam does eat alot of resources but even then your PC should still be fast assuming it’s 5 years old or newer.</p>

            <p>I haven’t had any problems recently with Steam and I’ve been running it on my old computer. Steam actually works better on my older PC than my newer &amp; more powerful one. Odd, I know.</p>

            <p>Steam is a bloated program, if you have a weak computer than it’ll probably suffer. Even more so when you’re playing a game.</p>
<p>To reiterate what everyone else has already said;</p>

            <p>Are you running a multi-core processor?  I remember there was at one point an issue with Steam accidentally taking up an entire core, which could be messing up some of your threaded processes.  You might want to look for it on the Steam support site.</p>

            <p>I don’t have any problems. But generally speaking as you install more and more things onto a pc’s HDD it can slow it down.</p>
