    <title>Boned on Ebay</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/boned-on-ebay/7507</link>
    <description>I sold a textbook on EBay and hadn&#39;t received payment for a week.  So I said &quot;this guy must want to see it shipped first,&quot; and clicked on the order in eBay and asked to see the shipping labels.  It said the guy lived in Georgia and it was also a woman.  So I addressed the box and sent it.  Immediately after, I got a messag that said &quot;sorry for the delay, just sent payment&quot;.  For kicks, I looked at he details.

It was a completely different address.

Now it&#39;s a guy that lives in New York.

Not really sure how I could have fucked up, or what happened.  Whatever the reason thouh, its on the way to the wrong address.  What do?</description>

<p>That’s why you should always ship only to the verified paypal address. If someone hacked someone else’s paypal, they wouldn’t want you shipping to the address on the paypal, would they.</p>

            <p>I haven’t had to do this for a while, and only as a buyer, but you can start a grievance and get the persons phone number.  (Assuming it’s real) start harassing them, asking them where your money is, also you have his address, he has stolen from you.  Call the cops.</p>
<p>I phoned a seller once, and got his dad (turned out he was 13) his dad gave him a dressing down over the phone, made him apologise to me and then I got the item 2 days later by special delivery.</p>
<p>I know a guy who bought an item and it was never sent.  He ran his own company and had a couple of reps in the area the next week.  He told the guy he was sending a couple of boys round to see what the delay was with postage (pretty much insinuating he was a gangster).  When the reps showed up, knocked the door and explained who they were he got the item very quickly.</p>
<p>Also report to ebay, might get the user banned.  I do hope you have some evidence of postage?  There’s a good chance that if they’re a dodgy user they’ll pay, then instantly request the money back from ebay claiming you never sent the item.  If you don’t have proof of postage ebay will just automatically side with the buyer.</p>
<p>Worst case (as a seller) is when someone hacks someone else’s account, and buys something.  Ebay freeze the payment and then return it.  Often often you have sent the item.  You lose out here too.  Through no fault of your own.</p>

            <p>In Poland we all use allegro.pl which is basically superior website to shitbay making it impossible for ebay to move into poland with its crap services. I had once to use german ebay to buy something from Germany. Also during my half-year stay in Belgium I had to use ebay.be. Their website and especially search engine are made of shit (choosing search only in belgium - website showing results from fucking usa and australia). The whole process of buying through ebay was pain in the ass. The website is so fucking messy I can’t describe it. You’re understood, mate…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Tis’ true. Think about it, when have you ever bought anything online and had it ship before you paid for it. Money always comes first. Being the seller, you should’ve have waited until you had at least a confirmation that the money was on its way, such as paypal does.</p>

            <ol>
<li>The buyer pays first and then you send the item.</li>
<li>The address on eBay is the address you post to. If you sent the item to that address, and then they give you a different one when they pay, that’s their problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>I bet they know the person whose address you sent it to, otherwise why the hell would they have that address on their eBay account?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You shouldn’t have given them a refund just yet. What if they’re okay with you sending it there?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ebay is annoying as they’re never obvious about things. You never know what you’re supposed to do unless you get some experience. I once paid a guy via PayPal and he cancelled my payment as it was a cheque and not a direct transfer. I don’t even know what the hell a cheque is, and he said it’s my fault. It has the PayPal logo on it, so I assumed it’s PayPal, which was what he wanted. He never said “pay by PayPal direct transfer, not by PayPal Cheque”.</p>
<p>How much was the item?</p>

            <p>ouch. technically, if you sold it on ebay, you are supposed to ship it to the address on ebay, even if they notify you of another address. thats the contract agreement you enter when you sell on ebay. If you sent it the the ebay address, and it was just wrong (say she moved and never updated it), then its her fault, and you don’t have to refund.</p>

            <p>Yes.  The shipper (USPS, UPS, FedEx, whatever) should be able to reroute it to the correct address if you called them with the tracing number, shipping details, etc.  You, as the person who shipped the package and the person who is receiving the package should be able to change the destination address.</p>

            <p>I sold a textbook on EBay and hadn’t received payment for a week.  So I said “this guy must want to see it shipped first,” and clicked on the order in eBay and asked to see the shipping labels.  It said the guy lived in Georgia and it was also a woman.  So I addressed the box and sent it.  Immediately after, I got a messag that said “sorry for the delay, just sent payment”.  For kicks, I looked at he details.</p>
<p>It was a completely different address.</p>
<p>Now it’s a guy that lives in New York.</p>
<p>Not really sure how I could have fucked up, or what happened.  Whatever the reason thouh, its on the way to the wrong address.  What do?</p>
