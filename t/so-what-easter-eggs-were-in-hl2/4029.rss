    <title>So what easter eggs were in HL2?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-what-easter-eggs-were-in-hl2/4029</link>
    <description>Everybody knows that there were [u]lots[/u] of easter eggs in HL1 (and Opposing Force, Blue Shift and Decay). But what about easter eggs in HL2 (and EPs 1 and 2)?

(If this doesn&#39;t warrants it&#39;s own thread as theres this [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=4804&#39;][i]one[/i][/url] just erase this thread)</description>

            <p>Yesterday I noclipped for the first time. Nothing’s going to be the same. I feel wrong and weird.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I did find Dr. Breen sat in a room in the sky, and got to shoot him in the head, so that was some compensation.</p>
<p>Seriously, I’m slightly worried noclipping may have ruined everything forever.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly you are supposed to put something large or heavy on the teleporter and start it up. (If this in some way helps in getting some achievement I am sorry for spoiling it.)</p>

            <p>emm… about those H.E.V. suit charger plates - i think that in hl2 there’s actually two of them. one in black mesa east junkyard and another one somewhere in canals at one of combine outposts. (I may be wrong 'couse I haven’t played hl2 in a really long time.)</p>

            <p>You’re thinking Episode 2. However, HL2 had a suit charger plate as well, and Eli’s lab has a volume of “LOST BOOKS”, where LOST is the only plainly visible part, so that may lead to confusion (it did for me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  )<br>
There’s also suicide guy, all the gman sightings, and various weapon caches.</p>
