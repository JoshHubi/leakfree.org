    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crush-on-map-bm-c2a5a/10216</link>
    <description>I have a glitch on bm_c2a5a map. When i die game crash with massage &quot;Can&#39;t load lump 53, allocation 6789549 bytes failed!!!&quot;. Or when turn on turbines and go under the dam, game freeze, and windows report pops up saying &quot;hl2.exe stop responding&quot;, and when i load save again same thing happens. I have added latest mpdm file from source sdk 2007 folder. Also my rig specification if it helps
CPU: Core i5 2500k
Ram: 8Gb
MB: Gigabyte Z68MA-D2H-B3
VGA: Radeon 6950 1GB
Machine is not overclocked. VGA driver version is Catalyst 12.6. If i can provide any info that can help, let me know. Thanks for any possible help or solution.

Beside that, game is great, on of the best old school FPS games i have played in years.
