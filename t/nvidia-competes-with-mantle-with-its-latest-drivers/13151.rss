AMD has found significant performance increases through its [url=&#39;https://www.shacknews.com/article/82911/battlefield-4-pc-gets-fps-boost-from-amd-mantle-support&#39;]Mantle tech[/url], which gives games more-direct access to the GPU, rather than going through APIs like OpenGL and DirectX, which can be bottlenecked by CPUs. The approach is being adapted for [url=&#39;https://www.shacknews.com/article/83636/directx-12-detailed-promises-increased-performance-for-xbox-one-pc&#39;]DirectX 12[/url], which promises to be a low-level &quot;console-like&quot; API that also enables devs to &quot;fully exploit the GPU.&quot;

Of course, DX12 won&#39;t be fully deployed until next year. That isn&#39;t stopping NVIDIA from trying to offer its own solution to compete with Mantle.

The new [url=&#39;https://www.geforce.com/drivers&#39;]GeForce 337.50 Beta Performance Drivers[/url] promise optimizations of up to 71%, according to NVIDIA&#39;s own [url=&#39;https://www.geforce.com/whats-new/articles/nvidia-geforce-337-50-beta-performance-driver&#39;]benchmarks[/url]. The performance gains come from being &quot;laser-focused&quot; on DirectX efficiency. Specifically, the new driver aims at reducing CPU overhead and increasing GPU utilization--much like Mantle.

Perhaps the most significant difference between NVIDIA and AMD&#39;s approach is that developers won&#39;t need to use a different API and all games that support DX11 will benefit on all DX11-capable cards from NVIDIA. &quot;Unlike our competitor&#39;s API solution, the DirectX 11 enhancements in 337.50 Beta benefit all GeForce GTX DirectX 11 GPUs, not just the latest and greatest graphics cards,&quot; the company says, taking an obvious jab at AMD.

Gains will vary depending on your CPU, GPU, OS, and system configuration, but everyone should experience &quot;some degree of enhancement.&quot; For NVIDIA card owners, perhaps now is a good time to do some benchmarking of your own.

            <p>Well was just wondering because 30 fps seems low in Skyrim. Guess the mods he has could make it run worse though. And it depends on his specs.</p>

            <p>Kind of want to try out Thiaf and some other games to see if I have anymore cool things happen like with Sleeping Dogs.</p>
<p>Edit: Tried Crysis for the hell of it and I swear my performance is better. I still get the occasional drop but it’s not as bad as I remember it, and I just beat it a few weeks ago. For example my framerate doesn’t drop nearly as much as I remember it doing when zooming in with the binocs. I don’t have any scopes to try right now though, as they also gave me performance issues. And I was using a custom config file with performance saving stuff too and still had these issues, but now I’m running entirely maxed and haven’t experienced what I remember happening. Wish I had benchmarked it before, or at least remembered better. This is great.</p>

            <p>Actually Mantle is advertising itself as increasing overall performance so AMD is at least. Nvidia’s benchmarks were more focused on how much the maximum/average framerate increased as well.</p>

            <p>Well if you look at my benchmark that’s about the max framerate I got. So while the drivers might not have increased my maximum framerate they help keep it there. I never looked at my framerate while playing that wasn’t locked so I don’t know if it was also 63 there but I remember the framerate dropping while driving and that didn’t happen the entire time I played just now.</p>

            <p>Didn’t realize they were beta drivers until I went to install them. Oh well. I did a few benchmarks with Thief, Sleeping Dogs, and Hitman Absolution.</p>
<p>Thief Old Drivers:<br>
Min: 19.9<br>
Max: 68.6<br>
Avg: 50.3</p>
<p>Thief New Drivers:<br>
Min: 36.5<br>
Max: 69.7<br>
Avg: 51.3</p>
<p>Sleeping Dogs Old Drivers:<br>
Min: 46.1<br>
Max: 63.8<br>
Avg: 61.2</p>
<p>Sleeping Dogs New Drivers:<br>
Min: 52.3<br>
Max: 63.8<br>
Avg: 61.3</p>
<p>HMA Old Drivers:<br>
Min: 40.78<br>
Max: 60.31<br>
Avg: 48.27</p>
<p>HMA New Drivers:<br>
Min: 42.80<br>
Max: 60.31<br>
Avg: 49.41</p>
<p>Hitman Absolution seems to be stupid but the other two pretty much only show a raising of the minimum framerate and I don’t know if those are likely to vary anyway depending on the run. If they’re not then that’s great I guess. Got a 6 fps increase on my minimum framerate in Sleeping Dogs and a 16 fps increase on my minimum framerate in Thief. These benchmarks are pretty much worse case scenarios too. Neither of those games run that poorly when actually playing the game. Shame I couldn’t do Arkham Origins and Metro LL but I didn’t have them installed.</p>
<p>Edit: Holy shit. Playing Sleeping Dogs right now to see how the framerate is while playing. Turned the frame limiter/vsync off to see how high and stuff it is. It’s rock solidly locked at 63 fps without budging at all. I remember my framerate often going into the 40s and 50s while driving but I’ve played for like 10 minutes with walking around and shooting and the game just stays at 63 fps. Now that’s something that these drivers actually do that’s noticeable.</p>

<p>Hold on, so if I download these new drivers what games will get performance increases? It seems to imply (or outright say) that these performance increases should affect all DX9, 10, and 11 games to some degree or another. I guess 3% is kind of cool, and they go higher, but it seems that most games aren’t getting too much performance increases. Being that it’s free and just because of the drivers I guess it’s pretty cool still.</p>

<p>Sounds like games other than the ones tested might see improvements as well, and that the improvements will vary a bit based on hardware.</p>
<p>I wonder if this will have the biggest benefit with a weak CPU, similar to Mantle?</p>
<p>Might test the driver on a PC with a GTX460 + i7 950, using Thief and Bioshock Infinite as benchmarks (and will look forward to using it when I get my GTX770 back… it might have WHQL certification by then).</p>

<p>AMD has found significant performance increases through its <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/82911/battlefield-4-pc-gets-fps-boost-from-amd-mantle-support" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Mantle tech</a>, which gives games more-direct access to the GPU, rather than going through APIs like OpenGL and DirectX, which can be bottlenecked by CPUs. The approach is being adapted for <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/83636/directx-12-detailed-promises-increased-performance-for-xbox-one-pc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">DirectX 12</a>, which promises to be a low-level “console-like” API that also enables devs to “fully exploit the GPU.”</p>
<p>Of course, DX12 won’t be fully deployed until next year. That isn’t stopping NVIDIA from trying to offer its own solution to compete with Mantle.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">GeForce 337.50 Beta Performance Drivers</a> promise optimizations of up to 71%, according to NVIDIA’s own <a href="https://www.geforce.com/whats-new/articles/nvidia-geforce-337-50-beta-performance-driver" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">benchmarks</a>. The performance gains come from being “laser-focused” on DirectX efficiency. Specifically, the new driver aims at reducing CPU overhead and increasing GPU utilization–much like Mantle.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant difference between NVIDIA and AMD’s approach is that developers won’t need to use a different API and all games that support DX11 will benefit on all DX11-capable cards from NVIDIA. “Unlike our competitor’s API solution, the DirectX 11 enhancements in 337.50 Beta benefit all GeForce GTX DirectX 11 GPUs, not just the latest and greatest graphics cards,” the company says, taking an obvious jab at AMD.</p>
<p>Gains will vary depending on your CPU, GPU, OS, and system configuration, but everyone should experience “some degree of enhancement.” For NVIDIA card owners, perhaps now is a good time to do some benchmarking of your own.</p>
