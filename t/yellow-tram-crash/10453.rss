    <title>Yellow Tram crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/yellow-tram-crash/10453</link>
    <description>Right at the beginning of &quot;Apprehension&quot;, when you get on the Yellow Tram and start moving. It loads the next map after the tram moves for a bit. On the new map, I travel for about 5 feet and the game crashes. Happens every time.

[b][u]Workaround:[/u][/b]
I started the tram and then got off. Walked forward to load the new map, then got back on the tram. That worked.

[b][u]Notes:[/u][/b]
I tried walking forward to load the map without the tram. I then stepped backwards to reload the previous map. The tram had disappeared. The lights for the tram were there, along with the control panel floating in space, but the tram itself was gone.</description>
