    <title>Unreal Tournament 3 crashes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unreal-tournament-3-crashes/2174</link>
    <description>Hey guys, so as the title says my UT3 has some problems, before you ask yes, the game is original and the problem is:

After some time the game crashes, not at the middle and suddenly, but at the end when another map is loading, in instant action and in campaing mode too. I searched gaming forums but havent found anyone else with a problem like this.
I have the latest patch and stuff.

The crash is not a normal one, it not just exits to windows but first it starts to show like im in safe mode, and after that the screen turns black and the monitors power light flashes like when you turn off the pc and leave the monitor on.

Only rebooting makes it working again but this is freaking annoying specially in campaing mode.

My specs:
Intel Core2 Due E7400 @ 2.8GHz
2Gb Ram
Nvidia GeForce 9800 GT 512 MB
Can&#39;t find the box of the motherboard so I don&#39;t rememeber that one..</description>

            <p>Clean your PC and see if you can check temp logs to see if it’s possibly overheating whilst running UT3. If so, try turning some settings down so your GPU doesn’t explode =]</p>

            <p>I used to have overheating problems back in the summer due to dust, and I’ve seen enough reports on the internets where heat was the cause to think that this might also be one of those cases. Open 'er up and run her like that and see if it clears it up. If so, clean her, then replace the case and your problem should be no more.</p>

            <p>I thinks if it’s screwing up your PC as it crashes, it has not much to do with UT3.<br>
I mean how should that game disable your computer in that way?<br>
maybe overheating or your vga driver gives up or something?<br>
check the temps while playing, especially cpu and gpu</p>
