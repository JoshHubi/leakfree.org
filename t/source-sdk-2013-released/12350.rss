    <title>Source SDK 2013 Released</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-sdk-2013-released/12350</link>
    <description>Valve has relreased the 2013 build of the Source SDK.  It includes support for OS X, Linux, Oculus Rift, and Steam Pipe.

It looks like Valve is changing the way mods are created from here on it.  instead, you&#39;ll have to use a Source game&#39;s authoring tools instead of creating a mod through the SDK app, which will be removed from everyone&#39;s tools library soon.  Look&#39;s like the Black Mesa devs may have some work to do.  I hope Steam Pipe doesn&#39;t break the mod.

            <p>Well, those same things there happened in five different maps. There’re no pointfiles so no leaks, and I also tried making a skybox in one of them to see if that would help, but that did absolutely nothing.</p>

            <p>Well, I think it’s safe to say that the singleplayer part of the 2013 SDK is broken. Enemy bullets can’t hit you, you can’t pick up ammunition, health and suit chargers don’t do shit, et cetera… or maybe I’m just doing this horribly wrong.</p>
<p>God dammit, just as I get back into modding.</p>

<p>Tripmine was prepared for this and planning ahead, making porting simple. Whether the BM devs were or not could have a huge effect on the difficulty.</p>

<p>Pretty much my main nitpick against SteamPipe. Redownloading all of them is a pain in case you have to reinstall stuffs. It also takes rather lots of space when you’re having several Source games around now.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That really freaking sucks, I think they should get rid of the whole individual game ‘authoring tools’ thing and have one single SDK launcher.  It was great for organization, all it really needed was some extra options and better stability.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I don’t really care about virtual reality as much as I do Linux/OS X support, I remember way back (like, right before it came out) one of my friends posted on here asking about a Linux port, if I remember right the answer was along the lines of “We will port to Linux if the option comes to be available.”</p>
<p>Hope I’ll get to play Black Mesa on my primary Linux desktop.</p>

            <p>Does anyone have any idea on how to exactly get a mod up and running with this?  I fooled around with it and couldn’t even locate the the DLL’s.  Is it even <span class="bbcode-i">possible </span>to create mods?</p>
<p>I was just getting ready to start work on an HL2 mod but now I’m really confused as to what I’m supposed to do.  I’m afraid to start using the normal SDK because it seems like they’re getting ready to pull it off of Steam.  So will HL2 be getting its own authoring tools?  The instructions on the wiki just tell you how to build the code and that’s it.</p>

            <p>This is…good? Right?<br>
I honestly know nothing about Source SDK. I made a portal map in it once, that’s it.<br>
But I’m just going to guess that Black Mesa will either never be ported to 2013, or it will be…very…very…very…very…very…very…very…slowly.</p>

            <p>Well this is fucked. SDK Base 2013 has some really stupid re-coding of player movement- It’s like half speed movement, can’t give or take damage at all. Plus, Episode One and Episode Two assets aren’t available, so my source maps are missing huge chunks of map and showing ERROR models all over the place.</p>
<p>What exactly are we supposed to do with this? And they’re phasing out the old tools in favor of something broken? AGAIN?</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, this gets even better. The new tools for the games will be in the bin folder of each individual game, instead of using the SDK launcher. This is horribly inconveniencing for anyone who needs to switch between engines when Valve inevitably breaks something.</p>

            <p>So it changes nothing for us. If BM devs will bother to port it to mac and linux, good then for those who own one. The majority owns windows anyway, for gaming at least.</p>

<p>So if I’m reading this correctly, we will have Linux and OSX support soon?</p>

</aside>
<p>The SDK will. Black Mesa is very unlikely to port, however. (see dev post above)</p>
<p>Bugger, the new Single Player SDK is 7+ GB. I’ll have to swipe some bandwidth at the coffee shop once I’ve cleaned out some space on my hard drive.</p>
