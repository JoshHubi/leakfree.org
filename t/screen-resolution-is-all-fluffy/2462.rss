    <title>Screen resolution is all fluffy</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/screen-resolution-is-all-fluffy/2462</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had my screen resolution at 1600x1024 since I got my new computer about 2 weeks ago, and the image was nice and crisp. Today I logged in to find my desktop icons rearranged, and the display is now blurry and kind of jagged.

I checked my settings, it&#39;s still at 1600x1024, 60 hertz, same as it ever was.

I&#39;ve tried different resolutions, and rebooting, but no dice. Could it be that I need to download some new drivers?</description>

<p>I can imagine you plugging in your new monitor and coming back here with the same problem.</p>

<p>I thought that too, but I said nothing in the hope that he’d do it and generate lulz.</p>

            <p>Yeah, if your monitor was working fine before, there is no reason for it to suddenly stop.</p>

            <p>Reinstalling the drivers/adjusment via Nvidia Control Panel didn’t work. I asked a Serious Business computer wizard, he said that my monitor is too shitty and generic and that I should just buy a new one.</p>
<p>So I’ll probably do that.</p>

            <p>If you have a nvidia control panel try adjusting the resoultion that way, sometimes it works where the desktop options don’t.</p>

            <p>Try pressing the auto adjust button on your screen.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work you might need to uninstall the drivers with a driver cleaning program and reinstall them.</p>
<p>Maybe your monitor has a higher resolution and it was misreporting before?</p>

            <p>It looks the same, it’s just low detail. I’ve fiddled with the buttons on my monitor and that didn’t do squat.</p>
<p>I’m gonna see if I need to install some new nvidia drivers.</p>

            <p>Check your monitor settings, with the buttons on it.<br>
Check for … em… dunno what it is in English… moiré in French, wiki seems to say it’s the same in English, but I don’t know if they use that term in the monitors…</p>
<p>Someone might have played a trick on you  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Does the resolution still looks like 1600x1024? Can you fit as many icons on your desktop, for example?</p>
