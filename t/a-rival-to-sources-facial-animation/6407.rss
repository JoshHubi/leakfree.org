    <title>A Rival To Source&#39;s Facial Animation</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-rival-to-sources-facial-animation/6407</link>
    <description>Kind of old now by internet standards but I didn&#39;t see it posted here and thought some of you may have missed it.  :wink: 

The facial technology / animation in Rockstar Games&#39; new [b]L.A Noire[/b] looks absolutely stunning...the characters look so real!

[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL9wsEFohTw&#39;]TECH DEMO[/url]

Now imagine characters such as Barney or the Gman with this kind of animation...jizz-inducing.</description>

            <p>I think this can completely break the uncanny valley - so long as it’s not overacted, and that I think will be the main problem, having to get top actors in to make it look realistic will seriously push the budget. As for an individual game though, why has no-one mentioned Enslaved??? The facial animations in that were better than most movies I’ve seen!</p>

<p>No one cares about gameplay and good music nowadays, all its about is graphics, crappy storyline and multiplayer.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Surely good music is as trivial as graphics, both of which I don’t think are trivial at all by the way. My point being that good music adds to the game the same as or less than graphics.</p>
<p>I agree on the multiplayer point, as multiplayer is only any fun with real life friends.</p>

<p>WHAT? No. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>LA Noire manages expressions; I will grant that. But those expressions, A. Are not very powerful, B. Do not change to fit dialogue. Even when they claim to be using an actor’s actual face in the recording, I am dead sure something is being lost in translation. Maybe it’s bad capture, the wrong capture points, or maybe the actor doesn’t realize he has to put his all into the facial motions, but it just doesn’t look believable.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You saw the vid right? There ARE no capture points. It’s the actor’s face straight up. I gotta laugh at the uncanney valley comments though. They are right. They need to work on their shaders, but can’t because of how the method works. They wouldn’t be able to separate the eyes.</p>
<p>That’s this method’s biggest problem.</p>
<p>Since the whole head model is taken from the actor’s performance vids, they can’t separate the models into any parts at all. The eyes are flat, so they can’t repose them or add a different shader to them to make them stand out or be more reflective because they don’t exist. They can’t even pose them for accurate eye lines. Every time a mouth is partway closed you’ll get this wierd vertex snapping thing going on where there wasn’t enough information for the cameras to see inside the mouth.</p>
<p>Guys, just think of the head as being made of voxels. It’s not, but it may as well be (in fact, I think that may be what the raw recording data is). The heads aren’t objects and can’t be treated the same as the character’s body (which they totally slumped on). That being said, I’m surprised they even got the detective’s hat to stay fixed on his head.</p>
<p>I say this method has a future, but it’s way too early to implement it into a game.</p>
<p>As for the audio?</p>
<p>idk. maybe it’s all placeholder. It’d suck for them to have to redo all the scenes AGAIN after doing them all twice. But I can see how it turned out how it did seeing as the first pass they were in a mocap studio where there was no room for a mic to be close enough, and the second time they were doing face capture in an environment that demands flat sound reflective surfaces and a far away mic. Fuck, maybe they will do a third pass. idk.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not really sure if I want any type of ragdolls in a game like this, be it euphoria or otherwise. It just doesn’t look like it would fit it, sort of like Heavy Rain.</p>
<p>Now, I like what they’re doing with this form of facial animation. It seems to work with what they’re doing, although, if they could manage to capture the full body animation instead of just the face, that would make it twice as good. That way, we won’t have realistic faces and “mechanic” body movement.</p>
<p>These two engines have their different places in the gaming industry. The facial animations for Noire aren’t something I could see being done with any Source game or vice-versa. I’m hoping they make something great with this technology. I don’t want to remember it as “that half-assed game with pretty faces.”</p>

            <p>This is what they did with Silent Hill 2. Except for Silent hill 2 they got into green suits and did every cut scene like that. Another reason why it’s my favorite game.</p>
<p>To the point, this game looks super promising. Definitly gonna pick it up.</p>

</aside>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>Yeah source has an excellent facial animation system, however put side by side with this new technology, this definitely looks a lot better.  It makes mimicking reality a lot easier for game developers, and if that’s not moving forward, then I don’t know what is.  And the body animations aren’t distracting.  At least not to me.  They aren’t jaw-dropping like the faces, but they’re perfectly fine.</p>
<p>This makes me think of what would happen if crytek, rockstar, and valve got together to make one game.  what a hypothetical.</p>

<p>One of the big points of the game is that you have to work out whether characters are telling the truth or not through their facial animations and body language. I’m guessing it <span class="bbcode-i">will</span> have a Mass-Effect style with pre-recorded reactions and scripted consequences depending on how your react to situations. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, <span class="bbcode-b">Sersoft</span>, I wouldn’t call it lazy, that’s like saying using ragdolls is lazy because they couldn’t be arsed to make death-animations. If it adds realism and immersion, continue to use it and improve it I say.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>honestly though source doesn’t even come close to that level of realism in terms of facial animation</p>
<p>but they aren’t even creating them instead they capture directly from actors which seems kinda lazy</p>

<p>Exactly, it’s not rendered on the fly, so you can’t compare it.</p>
<p>It’s just the technology they’re using to make the cutscenes. I wish they’d take a Mass Effect approach to it, but it’s to late now I’m sure.</p>

<p>Much better facial animation, though. We should make a thread about this impro- oh wait…</p>

            <p>Actually, Rockstar is only publishing this one, since it’s not developed internally by them, but by an Australian team called Team Bondi, so I suspect they’re using their own engine for this one.</p>
