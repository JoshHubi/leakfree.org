There was a press event in UK few days ago and some people had a preview of the game.

What we get to know :

- The game will be released in 2015
- You can unlock new weapons and powers with faith accumulated during missions
- There are 4 AI terminator squadmates with you during missions, and you can give them order
- There are differents type of genestealers with advanced AI and can ambush the player
- Full coop campaign where you play as 4 Terminators (no librarian in coop) with permadeath and the ability to take control of a genestealer when you&#39;re dead
- 5 paths skill tree
- Occulus rift support
- Not sure if good news but there is only 10 people working on it. Same as E.Y.E.

welding doors and armor customization among other things.

I am super fucking stoked for this game. This literally sounds like the first two space hulk FPS games which are two of my favorite games of all time, except these have coop too (though the second FPS game had coop it doesn&#39;t work in windows 7)

I was honestly expecting it to just be a regular horror FPS but now that I know you get to command troops I can&#39;t wait to see this in action. It&#39;s also made by the EYE developers - and a lot of it was clearly inspired by warhammer.</description>

            <p>Well, ever since Aliens: Colonial Marines and Watch Dogs, people have gotten leery of vertical slices or early trailers.</p>

            <p>It says ingame footage right as the UE4 logo pops up.</p>
<p>And I don’t see what looks so amazing about it, graphically it looks similar to user stuff I’ve been seeing done on UE4 or from my brother experimenting with it. It’s just good models and textures with UE4’s shading</p>
<p>I agree that the music is shit though</p>

            <p>It doesn’t even claim to be ingame footage, a sure sign in trailers that it isn’t.</p>

            <p>In game/gameplay typically means real time these days. I don’t think it’s completely out of the question for that trailer to be real time, but it kind of looks too good to be still.</p>
