How would you guys like to do another game on Sunday? This time with a 32 player limit, no accidental server shutdowns, and 100% more advance warning? And maybe more devs, but no promises...

Actually, I can&#39;t promise no accidental server shutdowns either. I&#39;m not the brightest spark.

8PM GMT, Sunday. Mark your calendars, fellas. And scientists. I look forward to being murdered repeatedly by the community!

Hi everyone,

I quite feel like playing this game called Half-Life. I don’t know if you know about it or not, but I heard from quite a reliable source that it’s an okay game. I’m not convinced, myself.

As a result, a few of us here will be playing tonight, at 9PM GMT (aka UTC), on my server, which I will aptly name [b][i]“Top Secret Public Official Unofficial Black Mesa Half-Life Server”[/i][/b]. “Why that specific time?” you ask? Because we just really seem to enjoy playing certain Half-Life related video games at that time. Probably best to not go into it too much.

The server will be free to join, limited to 24 players (not for lack of server space – but we don’t want total chaos!), and will be running a rotation of HL1’s stock maps (with the exact map dependant on the player count at the time). It will run, and we will be playing, until we feel like stopping! If you feel like playing, stop on by, join up, and play some Half-Life with us! I’ll try my best to be active and facilitate a nice gaming experience for all involved, and have a chat with you guys too.

Just be prepared to get killed, shit talked, killed again, shit talked some more, and then killed once more. In the nicest way possible, that is. But seriously, we’re gonna have some fun.

“Why do this?” you ask. The answer is, because I like video games. You should too. Let’s play some video games! I also think we have a pretty cool community, and I’d like to play some vidya with you guys. 

[i]Disclaimer: This is all entirely off my own back, because I want to play some HL1 with our community. It shouldn’t be taken as a precedent, nor does it reflect anything the team is doing. I’m not sure precisely how many devs will be involved – but I certainly will be.[/i]</description>

            <p>Yeah, it’s only after HL2 that they decided to separate SP and MP, because of Steam and maybe because the single player had a serious bug with sv_maxplayers in the early versions of half life 2.</p>

<p>I stuck with pretty much all red (I think) for the same reason. I didn’t want to end up with some horrible dark blue and teal color scheme.</p>

Also I have a couple fond memories of snarkpit, thought it didn’t make it into today’s rotation.</p>

            <p>Didn’t you know that stuff’s a bannable offense? :hmph:</p>
<p>I would love to join you gentlepeople for some semi-regular game sessions.</p>
<p>Also, I would say I really want Bounce to be in Black Mesa, but seeing as the way they appear to be “scripted” to have a predefined end location in Black Mesa (as opposed to just HL1 launch pads) I’m not so sure the experience would be quite the same.</p>
<p>Definitely Gasworks, though. That map has it all. Glad that’s a done deal.</p>

            <p>Great games guys, thanks for the session! Just like last time, had a blast!</p>
<p>Next time we might try HL2DM, if there’s enough demand for more of these community game nights. You guys interested in me making this a semi-regular thing?</p>
<p>Apologies for the laggy server, but we couldn’t get our Eastern US server setup in time so we were just using our UK server, which obviously wasn’t great for some people. Apologies for those of you who couldn’t join either, I’m not sure what that was about. Maybe just some screwiness in the server browser.</p>
<p>Question: which of the HL1 maps we played would you most like to see in Black Mesa? And why?</p>
<p>One of my favourite things about HL1DM is that it is truly a hardcore, serious, competitive experience, as evidenced by the following images:</p>
