    <title>Song Hunt</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/song-hunt/7022</link>
    <description>When Shazam and Google fail me, I turn to the trusty ol&#39; forums. Can anyone help me identify some songs?

Here&#39;s the pages with the songs on them. They&#39;re all flashes from m0ar.org. Someone linked me there in the YLYL thread and I kinda got lost watching them. They&#39;re all SFW.

[url=&#39;https://www.m0ar.org/164&#39;]https://www.m0ar.org/164[/url] (Ok, so I know the songs here, it&#39;s Straight Ahead mashed up with the Detective Conan theme, but I can&#39;t find out where it came from or who made it.)

[url=&#39;https://www.m0ar.org/583&#39;]https://www.m0ar.org/583[/url]

[url=&#39;https://www.m0ar.org/2723&#39;]https://www.m0ar.org/2723[/url]

[url=&#39;https://www.m0ar.org/3339&#39;]https://www.m0ar.org/3339[/url]

[url=&#39;https://www.m0ar.org/3795&#39;]https://www.m0ar.org/3795[/url]

[url=&#39;https://www.m0ar.org/3860&#39;]https://www.m0ar.org/3860[/url] - This one has about 5 variations that show up randomly when you go to this page. I&#39;m looking for the chiptune one and the fast, poppy, cartoon theme-sounding one. I know the others.

Any help is appreciated.</description>

            <p>How do you know it’s all bad if you haven’t watched it all yourself?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Anyways, I’m not really sure. It’s not entirely voluntary. I got linked to those sites, saw some awesome ones, and then I just couldn’t stop clicking next. Most of them are pretty terrible, but I can tell within, like, a second, if the flash is good or not, so I don’t waste a whole lot of time there. More than I should, though, really.</p>

            <p>Yeah but this is <a href="http://m0ar.org" rel="nofollow noopener">m0ar.org</a>, and so far I haven’t been able to find an index for it. Even if  they were on z0r, z0r’s index is incomplete anyway (and I’ve been through everything on z0r at least twice, so I’m pretty sure they aren’t on there).</p>

<p>Might be worth saying which of those you already know. I think one of them is from Donkey Kong Country 2 or a remix of something from it.</p>

<p>Ah, sorry. Yeah I knew that one, and Internal Locus by BT (if you look it up it’s near the end of the song). The others I don’t know. There’s one that has a lot of woodwind/drums stuff that I don’t care about. The other two I’m interested in. One sounds like it’s a video game chiptune, the other one is a pop song with synth and female vocals and at some point someone laughs in it.</p>
