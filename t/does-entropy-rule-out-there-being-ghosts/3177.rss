    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/does-entropy-rule-out-there-being-ghosts/3177</link>
    <description>Depending on who you talk to you, ghosts create cold spots from drawing energy around then, as a source of power...

Problem is, that to do that, it would take an increadible amount of energy to gather that much energy in the first place...

Thoughts?</description>

<p>XD</p>
<p>I did read a book in which Hawkings discussed matter being able to escape a black hole. I think it’s something like there is a reaction between a particle and an anti particle on the event horizon, one particle escapes, and the other is sucked in, and for some reason that means matter has escaped the black hole, I didn’t fully understand it.</p>

<p>A virtual photon being, that when a photon is sucked into a black hole, at the threshold of the event horizon (The point of no return) there is a copy of the photon created, (Energy pulled from within the black hole ( I think that is how it goes) and it escapes, having “Taken” a minute amount of energy from the black hole.</p>
<p>One problem with this is why are black holes so dark then? With energy escaping them, one would think they would be brighter… Maybe it is an anit-photon? Don’t know.</p>
<p>As for the negative ion thing, it has been apperently shown, that there are naturally occuring negative ion fields here and there. When a person is exposed to them, it can create a state of a being able to see things that are not there. - I would like to see follow up data to this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it may well be time to join the ghost and have a beer.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but hardly anything you say makes sense, it seems like smart sounding bullshit. Perhaps it’s not bullshit, it’s just too smart sounding to understand.</p>
<p>But anyway, rather than a “higher than average negative ion field” I think ghosts come from the fact that people are imaginative, they like to believe in crazy unexplainable things, and when they are in a dark scary house they get scared shitless and start seeing things. The supposed temperature drops that come from the presence of a ghost are simply feeling chilled do to fear. If you held out a thermometer during one of these temperature drops I diubt very much it would change. Or perhaps there really are temperature drops. Perhaps a draft makes the person feel cold and thee second they feel cold they piss their pants and start seeing ghosts. It just depends on which is the cause and which is the effect.</p>

            <p>Well, the problem is that many of the arguments for God, can be applied to both camps.</p>
<p>“God has always been”</p>
<p>“The universe (Not the way we know it now) has always been”</p>
<p>“God must have created, or there would be nothing”</p>
<p>“Who created God then?”</p>
<p>Round and round it goes. - There are theistic evolutioninst (Actually, a fair number of them - as well as agnostics, if any thing at all)</p>
<p>There is an interesting dicusion that is making the rounds in the Philosophy camp concerning people leaving behind a “Quantum Hologram” after they die. Now how someone came up with this, or how someone would prove it, is beyond my scope to comment - However, it is an interesting concept. An imprint of our physical person, in the qualtum feild.

<p>Mettemuse… Really? WOW. Umm… so why would one not think that being as these Ghosts are able to traverse through physical mediums, that they would simply not float away? Hahahaha… Thanks for the LOLs</p>

<p>I am merely saying that women who dress trashy, usually are not that interested in using their smarts to get by. I certainly have met some VERY brilliant, and beautiful women. None of them would harlot their bodies to take the easy road - for them, dressing like a trashy chick was insulting. They wanted to be known for their brains, not their boobs.</p>

            <p>Beautiful women are often dumb because they choose to get by solely on their looks, because, until they hit thirty, that’s much easier and usually more lucrative than using their brains. And when they hit thirty they just marry some 80 year old billionare and inherit his fortune. (google Ana Nicole Smith)</p>

<p>If she is so smart, then why in hell choose a shirt that does not even fit her properly? Social intelligence is every bit as (and in some cases, more so) important as intellect. She poses for a camera, flashes her chest, and gets paid.</p>
<p>“So, what do you do for a living?”</p>
<p>(Response) “Oh, I flash my body for cash to males who objectify chicks.”</p>
<p>Yeah… A lot of smarts there… Bwahahahaha</p>
<p>The part I laugh at, are the dill weeds that get all ga ga over a chick, simply because she flashes some skin. What happens? Buddy gets all revved without a second thought as to who the person is that is living in that skin. No smarts required.</p>
<p>Sure, beautiful women can be highly intelligent. I have been lucky enough to have known a few… But I have yet to see a chick dress like a trollop - who uses her body for power - that is actually intelligent. (As in really able to use her brain, not just try and gain power over the simple)</p>
<p>I was wondering who was going to bite.</p>
<p>I dunno, let’s turn the thought… can average, or even not so beautiful women be sexy?</p>

<p>Maybe she needed the modeling job to pay for her studies? For studies that maybe make her a goddamn nuclear scientist? If I work at a McD to pay my college loans does that make me stupid?</p>
