    <title>Case of the missing ram...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/case-of-the-missing-ram/5747</link>
    <description>Okay guys, here&#39;s the deal.

My PC has 2Gb of ram, in a single stick. Today I noticed that it was hanging alot, and that the system % of ram being used was constantly at about 50%. I thought it was strange, seeing as there were no heavy-duty tasks that I could see in task manager.

I checked the PC with SpyBot, and cleaned it out with cCleaner, then rebooted. I figured that as I always put it to &#39;sleep&#39; instead of shutting down, this might be an issue. But it&#39;s still under stress after all that. So now I&#39;m looking in system information,and it says;

Installed Physical Memory      2.00Gb
Total Physical Memory          2.00Gb
Available Physical Memory     986Mb

Hmm.


The only thing that I&#39;ve installed/uninstalled recently is a couple of windows updates, and ATI TrayTools (Which I removed, thinking it might be the cause).

Anyone have any ideas? :?:</description>

            <p>So, this isn’t ram now(although it’s still high).</p>
<p>twice today, random programs have been taking up my CPU power. First it was msn, and just now, fraps. They both take it up to 48/49/50 % CPU usage…I have to kill the app to get rid of it. Any ideas?</p>
<p>At the next opportunity, I’m reinstalling windows.</p>

            <p>Doesn’t make any difference because it was the BIOS that told me I had around 3500MB of RAM instead of 4096 like usual, but yes I’m running 64 bit.</p>

            <p>dammit I think I just got a case of the missing ram but more bluntly, my motherboard can’t handle the overclock. I turn on my PC and it says overclocking failed, I remove all the OC settings, still overclocking failed, I reset ALL the settings, it boots with only 3500MB of ram. :facepalm: I tested both of my sticks in the first slot and they both say 2 GB useable, fucking cheap G31 chipset. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/rage.png?v=9" title=":rage:" class="emoji" alt=":rage:"></p>

            <p>I’ve tried safemode, still get high usage.</p>
<p>I mentioned some problems with GPU drivers. I would reainstall older ones, but it seems to reject all official drivers from AMD, and any third party drivers are horribly out of date. I uninstalled old drivers, sweeped to clean everything, and now it says there are missing foles so they can’t install <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

            <p>My bad, then the problem is most likely a lot of memory being dedicated towards system resources.</p>
<p>Does starting your computer in safe mode decrease the amount of memory usage? Also, see if you can adjust how much shared memory is being dedicated for your video card in the BIOS/graphics card control panel.</p>

<p>Unless I remember wrong, he never said anything about having 1gb of ‘useable’ memory… But he has ~1GB of ‘available’ memory because the other ~1GB is used. Go see for yourself in ‘System information’, it shows ‘installed’, ‘total’ and ‘available’ (in Win7, at least)</p>

            <p>What test did you use? If you used the standard Windows memtest, did you change it to Advanced before running? Even if you did and it found nothing, I suggest running a different one, like Prime95. The fact that Windows says there is less memory available than you really have is most likely a hardware problem rather than a software misconfiguration, and it definitely has nothing to do with any programs hogging the memory.</p>
