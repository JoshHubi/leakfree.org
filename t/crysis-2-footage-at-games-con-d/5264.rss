<p>Yeah that really bugs me, they look corny and not very believable. They should take inspiration from Half-Life series instead were aliens look very convincing…</p>

            <p>A smart move for Crytek would be to release the specs sometime this year, that way if people get their gaming rigs in advance which will turn into higher sales for Crysis 2 on the pc. Unless they haven’t done so already.</p>

            <p>I like the hologram, reminds me of duke nukem 3d, but the multiplayer looks like a future cod. At least Crysis Wars/ Crysis 1 mp was unique, power struggle was pretty damn fun and tactical, and the nanosuit and ingame customization of weapons made it so much better. Now we are down to 12 players, and looks like no PS. This is what pisses me off, crytek copies too much.<br>
Far cry 1 - Great game until trigens (mini hell knights from doom 3) come out but still okay.<br>
Crysis - Great game until Aliens come out (the matrix) but alien gameplay dull as shit (warhead fixed this somewhat) - the only cool alien was the hunter that could throw you.<br>
Crysis 2 - Aliens look like a cross between halo/transformers. MP is MW2 in the future essentially (maybe better, maybe worse - need to play it first)</p>
<p>The thing that will make or break crysis 2 for PC - custom level and mod support.<br>
Crysis was hurt by having to download <span class="bbcode-i">every single fucking map</span> from a site, Crysis Wars it was fixed with an autodownloader but they lost a lot of players already by DROPPING SUPPORT for crysis. Hell, crysis wars should have been a free patch for crysis - although i will say a lot of the new maps were cool, and the game was a lot better overall.</p>
<p>More people play the <span class="bbcode-b">MECHWARRIOR MOD</span> then the original game. That’s just sad. At least the mapping community is still alive, because the editor is an amazing tool.</p>
<p>I’m not one for graphics, but for crysis - that’s kind of the point (Crysis 1 being fun for the first half was a big surprise to me) Crysis 2 (for PC anyway) i fear will suffer, not because the engine is worse, but because of time constraints and an overall lack of detail. Crytek says that the PC version won’t lose any focus but we’ve yet to see one truly amazing looking picture like we saw with crysis. And the sandbox seems much smaller, more like a series of non-linear areas in levels. Crytek is a pretty good company, but I hope they stay true to their roots and push the boundaries of everything, and not just one platform(I say that because every multiplat ends up looking the same on xbox and ps3 anyway) and forget about the PC.</p>

<p>I hope you can opt to play perkless somehow.</p>
<p>Console version looks quite nice, although the staged multiplayer footage makes it look not fun at all.<br>

<p>Haha d: they lied to you buddy. If this means you dont have a gaming rig yet, i highly suggest you consider buying one. Not just for crysis 2, but for many other games. The keeper was being half a pc elitist, and half making some sense (just using harsh, unneeded words)</p>

            <p>They said they heard the complaints about the the second half being too linear, and supposedly they’re going to fix that with Crysis 2. I can’t imagine though how they’re going to squeeze in such large levels when the consoles have so little RAM. (I realize consoles are capabale of large levels but this is the Cryengine we’re talking about) All the gameplay I’ve seen so far have all been in pretty small areas. I hope I’m wrong though…</p>

<p>Yeah, I can agree on that last sentence but aliens aren’t necessary for that. They could’ve used special forces for that. Not to mention you basicly lost all your freedom, which made the game so amazing.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It wasn’t so much the aliens, themselves, that ruined the gameplay, but rather is was how they were used.</p>
<p>They didn’t really have an exploitable weakness or some kind of special tactics you could develop to take them down, except maybe grabbing them since that would mean they automatically are dead when you throw them, but the grabbing mechanic was flaky for them, and they could one-shot melee you to death even on the easier difficulties.</p>
<p>Before, you were a little more free to approach things from various angles (though not EVERY angle, but it often had open camps and stuff to take out in the way you wanted), whereas the aliens were put along a much more narrow and linear path.  The brittle frozen plants also couldn’t really provide cover anymore before they shattered, which made sense, but also made things less variable.  Your enemies also didn’t necessarily operate in an organized way that could be analyzed.  They just kinda meandered around.</p>
<p>Despite their flaws, they actually could have been fine if it wasn’t just a switch to ALIEN BATTLE NOW mode for the rest of the whole game.  Crysis Warhead fixed this to a degree, mixing up the various combat situations throughout the game, as well as trying to improve ones people didn’t like before, and the game benefitted greatly from this.</p>
<p>AS FOR THE VIDEO, it actually raised my hopes.  Gaining new suit abilities, customizing it and leveling up sounds delightfully addicting and Deus-Exy.  Also, I saw a lot of singleplayer footage there so I don’t know what you dorks are talking about with bad multiplayer, though I don’t really care since I don’t really plan to play multiplayer, anyway.  Sure, it still looks like it’s taking a bit from Halo with anthropomorphized aliens and whatnot, but what they said sounded cool, and rather unexpected.  Also, the graphics look better, but I don’t really care about the graphics much.  It’s the candy on the icing on the cake.</p>

<p>The new crysis 2 footage proves that Crytek has faged out to the halo 3 crowd and consoles. If you’re a console douchebag that plays fps’s on console by all means get this game. Otherwise graphx were dumded way down in the footage. As i said, looks like gaylo 3 now. P.S. People who play first person shooters on console plz go get aids.</p>

<p>PC elitist faggot.</p>
<p>Oh, and I heard somewhere that the console graphics will get improved to look just as much like the PC as the console can handle it.</p>

<p>Graphically, it will look a lot better than the first game, it’s Crytek we’re talking about. It’s because they haven’t showed any PC gameplay yet, the console versions probably looks like ass compared to the PC version. Gameplay-wise I can’t say the same though, looks CoDified.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I can agree on that last sentence but aliens aren’t necessary for that. They could’ve used special forces for that. Not to mention you basicly lost all your freedom, which made the game so amazing.</p>

<p>Wut? You liked how almost everything is scripted entirely, and everything is just the most generic gameplay ever? The Korean part was waay more fun. If you want battlefields, go watch good movies like Saving Private Ryan, or if you want it scifi go watch Star Wars.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I though it was a nice change, I also liked the openness of the first half but if it would have just been fighting Koreans the whole game I would probaby have gotten bored with it. Suddenly you’re facing much faster and more agile enemies makes it more exciting imo.</p>

            <p>I liked the second part because everyone’s rushing to get off the island, in particular the fight around the half frozen hut with the gauss rifles, you’re surrounded by your teammates trying to hold off the hostiles, bullets and aliens flying all over the place, it’s just awesome. I just wish Crysis had bigger levels like Far Cry 1</p>

<p>Crysis 1 was already a huge disappointment in my eyes, that’s why I am very skeptical about the sequel. Every gameplay footage I’ve seen about Crysis 2 (including this one) looks neither innovative, nor interesting. The main focus seems to be the graphics again (sadly).</p>
<p>Sry, but I can’t help it…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you mean the second half of the game I agree that I was disappoint. But the first half of Crysis was amazing. Really, that part only depended on your creativity and imagination for it to be fun. The second half was all “Look what the engine can do”, so that was the only part that has a focus on the graphics.</p>
