            <p>I replaced AVG with Avast. AVG was slowing my computer down to hell, nevert found anything and was just useless. Ever since using Avast (apart from the automatic updates which I then turned off after they lagged my interwebs every 3 seconds) my computer has been faster and avast is just generally better.</p>

            <p>ah yes, that one. Would run unsigned code during the initial device scan using a buffer overflow. Windows has released a patch for that one. In fact it was one of the last patches windows released for XP.</p>

            <p>ah yes, AVG, last time I almost punched someone in the face for touching my computer was after my friend plugged in a flash drive with the autorun.inf worm and then tried to remove it by installing AVG, which failed, but it broke 3 of my cracked programs and erased half of my tech demo archive due to the compression method they use</p>
<p>never use avg, it’s worse than Panda antivirus</p>

            <p>Chances are the antivirus or windows’ anti-spyware blocked the file completely before you disabled it.<br>
You can try copying it elsewhere and running it again.</p>

            <p>maybe it’s a virus, pretending you cannot open it while it actually already screws with your pc.(worst case)</p>

            <p>is it some kind of windows file you’re not supposed to open? i don’t have any idea why you cannot access it.<br>
anyway have you tried the console?<br>
press start and search for “cmd”. if i remember correctly you might be able to open it via the “start” command(syntax: start Location\file.exe). If you just want to delete it “del” is the command for you to go. In Win XP you could workaround things with this. I don’t know if it’s still possible.</p>
