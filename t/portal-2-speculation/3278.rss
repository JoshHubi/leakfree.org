    <description>There are a couple of Portal 2 threads but none about the possible plot or characters.

So here we are, let&#39;s speculate as to how awesome Portal 2 might be  :smiley: 

Going by the rumours I&#39;m happy to know that Portal 2 will be a fully fledged game instead of a three-hour game. This means there&#39;s a lot more room for story and character development, and maybe they&#39;ll have it tie in more with Ep3?

What do yous peoples thinkses of this?</description>

            <p>Ya I just found videos at other places. It’s sad when Microsoft pays not only for a site to advertise, but to NOT play the intended video and just repeat the Halo ad over again, and again, and again, and again…</p>

<p>Pyro, you seem very confident about time travel’s impossibility. It reminds me of a group of ants, standing on a two-dimensional sheet of paper, and arguing whether or not it is possible to go from one end of that sheet to the opposite end faster than through a direct line between them. Of course, those ants will be certain that there’s no faster way, but we humans know better – we can fold the paper and make the distance “zero”. Actually, even the ants, given enough effort, would probably be able to fold the paper.</p>
<p>Similarly, we humans may some time be able to “fold spacetime” to enable faster than light travel, teleportation and perhaps even time travel. We may not yet know HOW to do that, but then again, we didn’t know how to cure Tuberculosis either.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, that it the most commonly cited example for explaining higher dimensions(and, by extension, time travel). I don’t see your point though. What are you trying to prove?</p>

<p>Yes, it does. We just don’t have the technology to do it yet, and we very well never get there. We are actually travelling forward through time all the… time. We just can’t go <span class="bbcode-i">back</span>, or travel instantaneously to a certain point.</p>
<p>I’m not trolling, either. Look at how the discussion started; I was talking about how the Steam forums were taling about how they thought Portal 2 would have time travel, and then we launched into a discussion about how it could be implemented in a game, and so on.</p>

<p>Time travel is, by defintion, traveling through time. More generally, it means at a different rate than normal, even backwards. It IS being discussed here, because you brought it up by saying time travel isn’t possible right now, which it is.</p>

<p>Pyro: What they’re saying in the video is that it is <span class="bbcode-u">FICTION</span> so you can use whatever rationalization you want.  You go into a room and you’re not there because you haven’t traveled back in time yet.  When you do, the other you is now an NPC which will follow the script that you recorded into the computer’s memory until you interact with the NPC, causing it to go off its script.</p>
<p>Simple.  Remember:  It’s a video game, not real life.</p>

<p>Did you watch the video all the way to the end?</p>

<p>Yes.<br>
In addition to breaking the fourth wall to satire themselves, that brings up an entirely different problem than we were discussing. I don’t see what it has to do with our current discussion.</p>
