    <title>Things I want to suggest</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/things-i-want-to-suggest/1068</link>
    <description>Here a few ideas for things, that I would like to see implemented (few of them I have already posted into the feature request page, but to get sure, that the will get noticed, I post them also here again):

1. I am missing the field &quot;Jabber address&quot; in the Instant messenger section of my profile.

2. Would be great if the feature &quot;custom user title&quot; would return

3. More Black Mesa-related Smilies would be nice (vortigaunt, scientist, hgrunt for example).

4. Besides the avatar function, it would be nice to be able to upload an optional user pic, which is visible in your profile then.

5. After BM is released it should established a special forums section for Black Mesa Editing, where mappers/skinners/modelers/texture artists/etc. can ask for help and present their custom stuff for the mod.

6. Support for embedding HTML5 Ogg Theora videos into a post.</description>

            <p>Yeah, but that entails first of all finding a post you made. And finding a post you made in order to find the posts you’ve made seemed a little paradoxical to me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Yeah I was just gonna say, you can search for posts and threads made by any user by using the drop-down menu when you click their name. You can also send a PM, check out their web page or email them.</p>

            <p>You beat me to it, tho I was going to go for replying in kind: “I’m to lazy to go find it for you, but since you’re too lazy to look around I figured I’d mention it’s existence…”</p>

<p>I got that in seconds from your user profile page, statistics tab, ‘find all posts by’ link. If you’re that bothered by the effort involved in that, here, save this link text and make a bookmark out of it: <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/search.php?do=finduser&amp;u=2182" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/search.php?do=finduser&amp;u=2182</a></p>

<li>
<p>Enabling HTML in posts is a bad thing. Just put a link to your video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User pics usually lead to abuse where some people put some really disgusting images on it, and it goes pretty much under the radar until a mod sees the profile… Yeah… I’ve seen some pretty disturbing profile pics…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggesting things for AFTER the release is just pointless…</p>
