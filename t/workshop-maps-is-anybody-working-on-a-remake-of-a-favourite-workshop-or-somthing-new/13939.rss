    <title>Workshop maps - Is anybody working on a remake of a favourite workshop or somthing new ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/workshop-maps-is-anybody-working-on-a-remake-of-a-favourite-workshop-or-somthing-new/13939</link>
    <description>Title says it all but here is my first contribution.
Probably one of my favorite maps from the old dm games, dm_sniper. I always loved all the secret areas and camping spots people would spend more time fighting for than using for kills XD
This is also my first map and I would appreciate any advice and tips as mapping is something I would like to do more of in the future.

Maybe, Chon, we should put out some pictures of the utter crap that we had of some of our maps before launch. Stuff that didn’t make it in or was heavily revised later.

<p>I already did that, in 4 way too long parts. Boy did Gasworks suck. It would be cool to show off some of the Lambdabunker/Rapidcore stuff though, to showcase just how far some of this stuff comes, and how much even experienced level designers have to learn and experiment.</p>

            <p>Sort of. I was imagining an abandoned construction cavern that collapsed in on an Anom. Mats.-style lab area while drawing it up, but of course nothing’s really set in stone.</p>

            <p>I’ve never created a multiplayer map, and I think I don’t really play MP enough, or know multiplayer level design theory well enough to create a decent one. But Black Mesa sure is tempting me to give it a shot.</p>

            <p>Title says it all but here is my first contribution.<br>
Probably one of my favorite maps from the old dm games, dm_sniper. I always loved all the secret areas and camping spots people would spend more time fighting for than using for kills XD<br>
This is also my first map and I would appreciate any advice and tips as mapping is something I would like to do more of in the future.</p>
