    <description>After fighting my way through the tunnel after the lobby battle in &#39;Questionable Ethics&#39; I went to open the large blast door at the end of the tunnel and lost ALL my weapons.  I reloaded the quicksaves and the game itself several times (my last actual save is waaaaaaay far back).  I can spawn weapons for myself with the console and shoot them just fine, but I can&#39;t see them at all.</description>
