    <title>Half Life 1 Loading Problem.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-1-loading-problem/1936</link>
    <description>I load the game and start a new game.  It goes to the loading screen and either gets to Establishing Network Connection to Server or Validating Game Files and just gets stuck and sits there.  If it reaches Validating Game Files, it will play the music from the beginning of the game but stays at the loading screen.  I&#39;ve uninstalled and reinstalled it, changed hardware options and everything and I can&#39;t get it to work.  Any help would be hot.

Edit: This is Half Life 1, not Half Life Source</description>

            <p>Hmm. You may have to check the integrity of the files outside of the game. Right click on the game in your steam menu, click properties, and go to Local Files. From There Verify Integrity of Cache. Thats the only thing I can think of. and keep internet connection would help too if you don’t already.</p>
