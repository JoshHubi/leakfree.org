    <title>Black holes as we know them may not exist</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-holes-as-we-know-them-may-not-exist/12974</link>
    <description>[url=&#39;https://www.nature.com/news/stephen-hawking-there-are-no-black-holes-1.14583&#39;]Just thought I&#39;d post this here[/url] for anyone interested in astrophysics who might not have heard about it yet. Apparently, if Mr. Hawking is correct, black holes as we currently know them may not exist. Instead, what we have identified as black holes may actually have no event horizon, no singularity, and may be possible to escape from. This would resolve the firewall problem, which arose when it was discovered that the theory of black holes would have required the event horizon of a black hole to be a highly energetic region that would incinerate incoming matter, violating the general theory of relativity. Interestingly as well [url=&#39;https://www.ndtv.com/article/india/indian-physicist-claims-he-resolved-black-hole-paradox-much-before-stephen-hawking-479760?curl=1391668291&#39;]an Indian physicist[/url] claims he came to these conclusions years ago.</description>

            <p>Perception is limited to senses which are but tools the brain uses in order to help itself process data and project them onto the illusion we call consciousness. We can hardly know anything beyond the scope of our own subjective reality… is there even such a thing tho?</p>
<p>For all we know, there’s no “I, you, we” only ME and each of us (us meaning I/me) is but a fragment of a sole mind manifesting itself through various means such as its dreams and imagination becoming what we would call matter and thus both subjectivity and objectivity are an illusion with there being just a one “whole” and even inanimate things are alive in a sense they are processes subconsciously controlled by the mind, explaining law of physics, mathematics and seemingly shi* working all by itself.</p>
<p>So yeah, all of “reality” may be something dreamt by a single entity.</p>
<p>No wonder different people believe so many different things, there’s no certainty to any “truth” yet… if ever.</p>
<p>But in Mr. Hawking I trust, he is very intelligent.</p>

</aside>
<p>No no, I’m not putting science down at all. There is nothing wrong with trying to explain the world/universe. What I’m saying is that religion and science have been having a centuries long blood feud over how much they hate each other when they are both basically trying to do the same thing: Give a passing explanation as to what we are doing and why we and everything else, exist.</p>
<p>Now topic. Black holes man, they suck. Or not anymore? They don’t suck as much as they used to, is what I’m gathering, yes?</p>

<p>Well yeah, it still needs to be a supermassive gravity well.</p>
<p>They are still so powerful they completely absorb light, right?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes and no…in the revised theory they would still trap light and matter with their immense gravity, but instead of it being forever sealed away, it’s possible for the absorbed matter and light to escape (at the death of the black hole I believe was the idea), albeit very mangled and unrecognizable.</p>

            <p>@ CPU, I would suggest that be changed to “a bunch of assholes trying to <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">explain</span></span> shit”. There is no possible way in this lifetime to prove anything regarding black holes, and a myriad of other things, science attempts to formulate an explanation as to why things do what they do, which isn’t all that different from religion when you think about it.</p>
<p>The funny thing is how angry both parties will get when you tell them they are actually quite alike. lol</p>

            <p>Well yeah, it still needs to be a supermassive gravity well.</p>
<p>They are still so powerful they completely absorb light, right?</p>

<p>so what are black holes then? quantum space optical illusions?</p>

<p>If I’m understanding everything correctly they’d be ECOs, Eternally Collapsing Objects. Instead of being completely collapsed into a singularity, they’d instead be in a state of constant collapse, always on the verge of compressing into a singularity but being held up by outward radiation pressure. This would solve the information loss paradox and the firewall problem.</p>

<p>More or less. If we could actually get out there and study these kinds of phenomena I’m sure we’d learn a whole lot more than just sitting here on Earth debating the math, but unfortunately that’s all we can do to advance our knowledge of astrophysics.</p>
