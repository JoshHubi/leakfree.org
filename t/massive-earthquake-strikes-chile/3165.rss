A massive earthquake with a magnitude of 8.8 has struck central Chile, the country&#39;s largest in 25 years.

The quake struck at 0634 GMT about 91km (56 miles) north-east of the city of Concepcion and 317km south-west of the capital, Santiago.

Chilean television is reporting 16 deaths so far. President Michelle Bachelet also said a large wave had affected one southern island group.

The US issued an initial tsunami warning for Chile, Peru and Ecuador.

That was later extended to Colombia, Antarctica and Central America. Japan&#39;s meteorological agency warned of a potential tsunami across large areas of the Pacific.

Ten deaths have so far been confirmed in Bio Bio, five in Maule and one in Araucania.

President Bachelet said a &quot;wave of large proportion&quot; had also affected the Juan Fernandez island group, reaching halfway into one inhabited area.

She said if there were more aftershocks, people in coastal areas should go to higher ground.

Ms Bachelet warned people not to travel on roads in affected areas as a number of bridges were down.

She called on people to remain calm and contact the authorities if they needed help.

Many of Chile&#39;s news websites and radio stations are not accessible.

Buildings in Santiago were reported to have shaken for between 10 and 30 seconds, with the loss of electricity and communications.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake struck at a depth of about 35km.

It recorded a 6.2 magnitude aftershock in the same area soon after at 0652 GMT and another of 5.5 magnitude about 84km from Santiago at 0819 GMT.

The USGS said tsunami effects had been observed at Valparaiso, west of Santiago, with a wave height of 1.69m above normal sea level.

One journalist speaking to Chilean national television from the city of Temuco, 600km south of Santiago, said many people there had left their homes, determined to spend the rest of the night outside. Some people on the streets were in tears.

Mark Winstanley, who contacted the BBC from Vina del Mar, 100km north-west of Santiago, said buildings had shaken and electricity and phone connections were cut but he could see no structural damage yet.

A university professor in Santiago, Cristian Bonacic, said that this was a massive quake but that the cities seemed to have resisted well. Internet communications were working but not mobile phones.

Chile suffered the biggest earthquake of the 20th century when a 9.5 magnitude quake struck the city of Valdivia in 1960, killing 1,655 people.

            <p>An 8.8 magnitude is MASSIVE! I’ve been through a 7.2 back in 1992 and that was pretty big. I can’t imagine how those from Chile felt during that.</p>
<p>Next one will probably be in California. San Andreas fault has been too quiet…</p>

            <p>I just have to accentuate that everyone in my family was extremely luck, no one in my immediate or extended family has died or gotten any injuries and looking at how many there are to account for it’s practically a miracle.</p>
<p>One of my cousins was stuck in an elevator during the earthquake.</p>
<p>A couple of them and my aunt were in a bus at the time, the bus was about to cross the highest bridge in Chile when they decided to stop and not cross the bridge, 2 minutes later it collapsed.</p>
<p>A bunch were in Maule which is literrally on the coast (walk towards it for 3 minutes and you’re at the beach, they didn’t get a tsunami since there is an island in front of them.</p>
<p>A few were in Santiago during the time, one in an office building which swayed a little too much.</p>
<p>A bunch of really lucky situations. Jesus Christ.</p>

            <p>Jokerine, I hope everything is OK, as well as can be expected under the circumstances, anyway.  I’m sure everyone is fine, and there are just technical problems preventing them from contacting you.  Cell sites that are working are probably jammed with calls.  I’m thinking that your family stayed to help out or something…</p>
<p>You mentioned people looting…asking why people are stealing TVs and whatnot…  I dunno bout you, but when is there a better time to steal a TV?  Every time <em>I</em> go to try to steal a TV, there are windows and alarms and employees preventing me, and then the cops come, and it all turns into one big hassle, and everyone’s time gets wasted.  All I wanted was a TV, but no, now the employee has to sit around giving a statement to the police, the police have to do extra paperwork, and then I have to go to court, and that just wastes more of everyone’s time, no to mention wasting the judge’s time, the lawyer’s time, and the time of 12 people who obviously paid for their TVs.  After the first four or five times, it just gets real old, so I have just started waiting until there’s a good old fashioned riot or natural disaster before I start looting…  The only problem then is making sure you get to stores early enough so the good stuff is still there…cause you don’t wanna get stuck with the 26" 60Hz 720i TVs…</p>
<p>(Sorry, I get through things by joking, it’s what keeps me sane…ish…)</p>

            <p>Thank you for the update Jokerine.</p>
<p>We all share your concerns, and truly wish you the best possible out come in the aftermath. When a person does not know what is going on, it is understandable to have our thoughts play out the worst case senerios - If you can, try not to allow those thoughts to play through your mind. As was state above, not hearing from them is likely due to cell disruption or some other hindering thing, account of the situation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, do feel free to share what is happening, if you care to.</p>
<p>From the concerned on this site,</p>
<p>The best to you and yours.</p>

            <p>Great to hear that you’re OK Jokerine.</p>
<p>When I heard about the earthquake I remember thinking if Chile is where you lived. I was unsure but when you didn’t log on for a while…Well yeah.</p>

<p>Well we aren’t sorry for the long post. I think some of us needed to hear that.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear about your loss, and wish the surviving members of your family the best. I hope that the travelers are just having trouble getting through all of the destruction, but are ok, and not hurt or injured at all.</p>

<p>Well, things aren’t looking so good now. Since my aunt, my dad’s sister, who lived near the epicenter of the quake, got squished when her house collapsed, my dad and mom went there to check on things and bury her.</p>
<p>We live in the capital, and Chanco, the epicenter, is very far away, and the roads are pretty much fucked. My grandmother was in a different town at the moment of the quake so she doesn’t know her daughter is dead; besides, as far as we know my grandmother may be dead too, since she’s old.</p>
<p>My parents left on the car at noon yesterday with other of my dad’s sisters, and we haven’t heard of them since. It’s noon again now, so that’s 24 hours. The trip usually takes about 4 hours, now it’s supposed to be taking up to 10, so I am heavily worried right now. I’m hoping they’re okay, and that they’re not answering the phone because there is no signal, and not because they’re… dead or something.</p>
<p>Around the country around 7 cities got wiped my tsunamis, and looting is starting to be a real problem. I mean, seriously, I kinda can understand it if people steal food, but how can people be such dicks that they steal LCD televisions from stores? Makes me rage &gt;.&lt;</p>
