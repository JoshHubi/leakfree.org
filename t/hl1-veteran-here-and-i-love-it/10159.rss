    <description>Thank you for making this happen.
You hyped me and you delivered!
It was a long time since an fps game delivered after hyping me for years on end.
The fact that this is not even an original game and it&#39;s a remake made it even more improbable to deliver and yet it fucking did!

I just have one bitching though.
When you grab the hazard suit, I expected to hear the first time usage maintenance voice and I didn&#39;t.
You should have not removed that unless that&#39;s an actual bug!

I also would have loved if you would have kept the grunt scary radio voices.
When I first heard them in hl1 for the first time, they scared the shit out of me and gave hl a distinct feel.
The original grunt voices will be forever missed if you don&#39;t magically re add them.
Even in hl2 valve wanted to bring back grunt voices with a twist as you can see at the metro cops.
Valve knows the radio voices of the grunts were a distinct flavor of the hl series and they didn&#39;t remove it.
You should bring those voices back in an update maybe sometimes in the future!</description>

            <p>Hl1 vet and purist here, as well. Back in '98 I walked 45 minutes each way in -30C to spend my birthday money on HL. It’s my favourite game of all time. This game did it complete justice. For the first few chapters I was a bit skeptical, but  it kept impressing me more and more. Nearly everything was incredible. Textures, mapping, models, animations… All stellar. There were a few moments in combat that seemed poorly planned (especially playing on hard) but that’s my only complaint. The game is fucking awesome. I’m still blown away at the quality of BMS… <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Can’t fucking wait for XEN!</span></span></p>

            <p>I have to add to the gushing. I have some criticism too, but I’ve expressed that elsewhere.</p>
<p>Black Mesa feels like Half-Life the way I remember it - except when it’s different. So far all the changes have had me overjoyed. The section immediately after the accident? Brilliant, simply brilliant. Physics puzzles? Joy! I feel more like a scientist than I ever did playing the original.</p>
<p>Actually, why am I posting here instead of playing some more?</p>

<p>Again, I agree, but maybe it was another copyright issue? That being said, The new grunt voices sound pretty cool too in my honest opinion.</p>
<p>ONE thing I’d like to add: There should have been more voice actors for the scientists at the start of the game. It sounds like all the male scientists have the same voice. I’m sure pretty much any man could voice a random scientist!</p>
<p>But those are minor details. Overall, amazing work, guys! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
