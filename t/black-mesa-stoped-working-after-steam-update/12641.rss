    <title>Black Mesa stoped working after Steam Update</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-stoped-working-after-steam-update/12641</link>
    <description>Hi,

Have spent hours playing Black Mesa without big problems but got a Steam update today and can no longer play the game. Error message I get is SetupArrayProps_R: array prop &#39;(null)&#39; is at index zero. According to information I have found round internet this message relates to a incorrect Source SDK engine this mod is trying to use. I have checked steam.inf file in BMS folder and it contains this: appID=218. 

How can I fix this issue and run the game?</description>
