    <title>BF 2142 help</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bf-2142-help/6703</link>
    <description>I installed Battlefield 2142 and updated it using the 1.5 patch, then again with the 1.52 patch.  When trying to join a multiplayer game it says that my client version is older than the servers.  I looked up on EA&#39;s Support pages for answers and saw that they recommend updating using the incremental 1.4-1.5 patch.  So after downloading the 1.4 patch and uninstalling/reinstalling Battlefield 2142 (I did not delete the Profiles, Server configs, or screenshots, don&#39;t know if this helps or not) and patching it to 1.4 then again with the 1.4-1.5 patch incremental patch, and then finally the 1.51 patch from earlier.  It said the same thing.  So how can I fix this?  I, however, did notice on the title bar it says &quot;BF2142 (v1.10.107.0) both times when I tried to enter the multiplayer, should it not say &quot;1.51&quot;?   I have included images of the &quot;errors&quot; I have mentioned.

I contacted EA support but they were of no help, so I am turning to you guys.  Could it be a registry error?
