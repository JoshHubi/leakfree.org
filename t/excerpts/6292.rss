    <description>i&#39;ve been working on a book for about three years now. the book is called albacore and it&#39;s a collection of various poems i&#39;ve been writing. not sure when it&#39;ll be done, hopefully some time this year.

albacore started out as a drunken personal bet to write a book of 72 pages and publish it on lulu.com within a week. i didn&#39;t publish it, needless to say, but continued writing. eventually a friend, who is also a poet, came to me and suggested we write a book in collaboration, each respond to the other via non-lyrical poetry. it sounded like a good idea so we started and eventually began diverting off to insanity, forgetting the whole &quot;response&quot; part.

anyway, i&#39;m gonna post excerpts of some of it here now and then, from poems i particularly like. i&#39;m interested in getting my work out to people, for better or worse. i don&#39;t mind feedback and/or criticism. so yeah. plan on doing a reading at a local venue sometime within the next week or so.

[i]the grind[/i]
whatever you
do
don&#39;t
let the
grind
get to
you.
bottomless pits are made by wizards,
hell is a mythological location,
there&#39;s no black and white without gray
the peace
of life
comes at you
in the strangest, depression-fueled drug-crazed moments
serenity
is only a
revelation
away.

[i]a waking hell[/i]
i live in a waking hell
you wake up, and eat some toast
while the cigarette butts pile up
while the beer cans pile up
i live in a waking hell
drive to work,
stuck in a traffic jam
staring off into the bright blue sky,
clouds drift like your gasping breaths
into the cold night air
a child plays
some friends talk
you go to sleep
and awake from a dreamless slumber
the right combination of words
the right facial expressions
the right body language
to make everything okay.
you sleep
you breathe
you dream, eat, smoke, drink, fuck, fight, yell
and do it again.
never escaping
always pinned down
from day
to
day
the cycle continues. never broken
except momentarily.
the minutes and hours blend into years
what happened yesterday could&#39;ve happened
two weeks ago,
you&#39;re never quite sure.
i live in a waking hell
with no escape
but to pass the time by
idly waiting
for release

[i]serpent boiling[/i]
a serpent boiling in a tin can
threads of fate
twined in a robe,
empathy
never coming
strange places
to find
a cure for
a disease
like a dog, hell
waits at the door
for you to come.
sweat drenched, clinging to sheets
strung out on acid
you shrink away from the light
edged ever closer
feet to the earth
unknown, but feeling,
i sit and wonder
what dreams do end
this sweet death?</description>

            <p>Thank you sir, I appreciate the kind words. Yes. It’ll be published through <a href="http://Lulu.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Lulu.com</a> in both downloadable ebook and a hardcopy. We haven’t nailed out the specifics but I’m sure the ebook will be free and the hardcopy reasonably priced.</p>

<p>Those were both winners, but I especially liked that part. I can really identify with that. Or at least I think I can. So, how can I read the whole thing? Are you going to publish it on <a href="http://lulu.com" rel="nofollow noopener">lulu.com</a>, or is there going to be a print version?</p>
<p>Also, +1 for the Tom Waits in your sig.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>you got it. here’s the first two poems of mine that’ll appear in albacore:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">a dog would</span><br>
the dog would,<br>
under the ground<br>
earthy fetters shiver<br>
as the wind blows black through<br>
the trees.</p>
<p>far away, in mountain streams<br>
the life force of the planet.<br>
caves where no light has ever reached,<br>
deep in the core of us all.</p>
<p>a dog would,<br>
stand high, tongue lolling,<br>
shrouded in a canopy of forgetfulness<br>
the leaves fall<br>
in time with the deaths of each man.<br>
fear<br>
gunning the engine,<br>
stepping out of the car<br>
to witness a waterfall.</p>
<p>a dog would,<br>
as the seas ebb on<br>
slowly enveloping<br>
us<br>
flowing up into the streets,<br>
completely unaware<br>
sea life teaming.<br>
edging its way into our homes<br>
encroaching.<br>
bearing down.</p>
<p>a dog would,<br>
as ancient men danced<br>
around flames glowing hot<br>
as strange beats howled and gathered about<br>
seeking just outside the the shadows<br>
things<br>
and mysteries<br>
still unknown to us.<br>
old ways, old joys,<br>
forgotten in it all.</p>
<p>a dog would.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">who are the shadows that, out of time, seek?</span><br>
a mother urging her child to<br>
do well in school.<br>
but fiends nip at their heels,<br>
the streets are a warzone<br>
lost souls drift<br>
not sane yet empty<br>
drawing blood from rocks<br>
on ravaging<br>
two day weekend bender<br>
that lasts all year.<br>
white thighs<br>
full breasts<br>
dreams of something unreal<br>
this fakeness, tinkering with our minds.<br>
these men<br>
telling us<br>
heretofore<br>
we’ve been missing something.<br>
and we believe with such readiness<br>
white thighs<br>
full breasts<br>
broken cigarette dangling from an unweary finger.<br>
bright eyes, telling of the coming death,<br>
speaking<br>
mixing such truths and lies<br>
of waste and wastedness<br>
of lying awake at night,<br>
staring at so many ceilings<br>
so many car doors shutting with anger<br>
chemicals draw out the venom,<br>
collecting in little pools around your feet,<br>
shrouded in a mystery,<br>
wrapped in a warm blanket,<br>
life slowly fades into sleep.<br>
to things unremembered.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/guzzi">@guzzi</a>: i only write when i drink.<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/krazor">@krazor</a>: thanks. serpent boiling and yolky are two of my favorites.<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/sersoft">@sersoft</a>: i’ve always liked that old hem quote “write drunk, edit sober.” except i simply forgo editing.</p>
<p>here’s another that i’ve gotten some good feedback on.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">though the beat</span><br>
contained within<br>
a shit stained, blood<br>
spattered, beaten tome<br>
shades under trees,<br>
thriving in agony<br>
life struts about<br>
like a whore<br>
dressed in thick linen,<br>
drab<br>
with drapes of irony.<br>
though you may look<br>
and never touch,<br>
sanctity<br>
slips through thy fingers,<br>
as sand<br>
tall castles which mean nothing<br>
jutting from spaces between understanding<br>
just out of sight,<br>
unbending<br>
yet bending to the will,<br>
a drum carries the dancers on<br>
though they understand not<br>
to what end,<br>
that never comes.<br>
fate which<br>
fires blades of glass<br>
words which cut<br>
more than any knife<br>
and yet as the beat<br>
of another heart does carry<br>
me further,<br>
i dance, not knowing<br>
where it ends.</p>

            <p>well here’s one that’s humorous.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">yolky</span><br>
“you’re a sack of shit,”<br>
i spit, broken cigarette clamped between<br>
my lips.<br>
speeding by the river at maybe<br>
50 or 60<br>
street lamps whipping<br>
by like faeries<br>
in the night.<br>
i’m drunk<br>
we’re all drunk<br>
beer cans in the glovebox,<br>
on the seats under us,<br>
filling the car up to our ears,<br>
filling the trunk,<br>
i swerve and suddenly i’m home.<br>
i clamber up stairs,<br>
throw the door open<br>
collapse on my bed<br>
and pass out.<br>
and that’s when i dream<br>
these visions come to me<br>
of grinding teeth, flames, screaming<br>
there’s a beautiful woman, completely naked<br>
but instead of human legs she’s got horse’s legs<br>
“what the fuck,”<br>
i say to her as i grab her by the waist,<br>
“let’s get goin”<br>
and she says<br>
"you’d fuck any woman that could fog a glass, wouldn’t you?"and i say<br>
“no, just the ones with horse legs”<br>
and then i wake up. it’s morning now.<br>
i feel sick, hungry, hungover, tired,<br>
and forget all about the ominous dream for the time being.<br>
i put some eggs to boil<br>
i go outside and have a cigarette<br>
and while i’m sitting there i remember that night<br>
there was a bunch of people, and drinking<br>
speeding through space time,<br>
what strangeness this all is.<br>
all humans,<br>
some of us drink to forget<br>
but<br>
i drink to remember.<br>
it’s metaphysical, it’s important,<br>
more important than<br>
money or sex or leather wallets or old stacks of newspapers.<br>
i go back inside<br>
i run cold water, peel the eggs,<br>
it’s difficult, the shell keeps pulling off<br>
chunks of egg with it. i get frustrated and<br>
spit<br>
“sack of shit,”<br>
and take a bite of the egg.<br>
mouth full of shell shards, cutting my gums,<br>
the egg wasn’t fully cooked. i pour mustard and<br>
paprika on it anyway and eat it.<br>
i get the sense that my life is a metaphor but<br>
instead of thinking about it i go get drunk.</p>

the peace<br>
of life<br>
comes at you<br>
in the strangest, depression-fueled drug-crazed moments<br>
serenity<br>
is only a<br>
revelation<br>
away.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">a waking hell</span><br>
i live in a waking hell<br>
you wake up, and eat some toast<br>
while the cigarette butts pile up<br>
while the beer cans pile up<br>
i live in a waking hell<br>
drive to work,<br>
stuck in a traffic jam<br>
staring off into the bright blue sky,<br>
clouds drift like your gasping breaths<br>
into the cold night air<br>
a child plays<br>
some friends talk<br>
you go to sleep<br>
and awake from a dreamless slumber<br>
the right combination of words<br>
the right facial expressions<br>
the right body language<br>
to make everything okay.<br>
you sleep<br>
you breathe<br>
you dream, eat, smoke, drink, fuck, fight, yell<br>
and do it again.<br>
never escaping<br>
always pinned down<br>
from day<br>
to<br>
day<br>
the cycle continues. never broken<br>
except momentarily.<br>
the minutes and hours blend into years<br>
what happened yesterday could’ve happened<br>
two weeks ago,<br>
you’re never quite sure.<br>
i live in a waking hell<br>
with no escape<br>
but to pass the time by<br>
idly waiting<br>
for release</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">serpent boiling</span><br>
a serpent boiling in a tin can<br>
threads of fate<br>
twined in a robe,<br>
empathy<br>
never coming<br>
strange places<br>
to find<br>
a cure for<br>
a disease<br>
like a dog, hell<br>
waits at the door<br>
for you to come.<br>
sweat drenched, clinging to sheets<br>
strung out on acid<br>
you shrink away from the light<br>
edged ever closer<br>
feet to the earth<br>
unknown, but feeling,<br>
i sit and wonder<br>
what dreams do end<br>
this sweet death?</p>
