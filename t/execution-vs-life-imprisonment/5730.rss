    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/execution-vs-life-imprisonment/5730</link>
    <description>What are your thoughts on the subject? Should murderers all be executed, or should they just be locked up for the rest of their natural lives? My personal opinion is that murderers, pedophiles and rapists should all be executed, the last two being neutered without anesthesia first. Also, if you believe it is a circumstantial  thing, how horrible does the crime have to be for you to think it warrants the death penalty?</description>

<p>Thinking about it again, I think 4 years for pedophilia is reserved for the least severe cases, not rape. For instance, the guy might have just intentionally grabbed a kid in an improper way. I’m no expert in law, someone might explain this better.</p>

            <p>Fact: Death penalty is not flawless, therefore even innocent inmates are killed</p>
<p>Fact: To prevent innocents from being put on the chair, huge efforts must be made to make sure they are in fact guilty. This costs massive amounts of money. And still does not work properly. Even with all the resources it binds, the system still kills hundreds of innocent people with frightening regularity.</p>
<p>Fact: Death sentence does not have any positive effect on crime rates whatsoever. Never has had and most certainly never will.</p>
<p>Fact: The only benefit that death sentence has ever had was to satisfy the primitive instinct of vengeance by those wronged by the suspect. It is cruelty met with cruelty. An eye for an eye. A system that has never worked and never will.</p>
<p>Fact: Life long imprisonment is overall cheaper.</p>
<p>Fact: Both systems only treat the symptoms, but don’t fight the problem at the root. Only from a massively flawed society capital crimes and murdering, ravishing madmen can spring forth.</p>
<p>Question: How can you teach your children that it is wrong to hurt and kill, if the government of your country, whose laws you have to teach them to obey, does it and is considered to be right to do so?</p>

            <p>I am totally shocked by this thread.  I had no idea so many people support the murder of citizens by the state.  There is no moral standing for killing another human being EVER.  Aside from that, there is a major problem with innocent people being sent to death row.  A very good instance are the West Memphis Three, wrongly convicted of murder in 1994 by a bunch of backwoods no nothing redneck fucks.  The evidence used against them?  They look like satan worshipors and listen to Metallica, I kid you not.  They are currently scheduled for death despite DNA testing showing that the blood found at the crime scene did not belong to any suspect or victim of the crime.  The court has refused to consider this new evidence.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvON2sUfEaQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvON2sUfEaQ</a></p>
<p>How would you like to be one of these men?  Awaiting death for a crime you did not commit?  Would you support the death penalty still?</p>
<p>You could also ask these people, a list of the lucky few who have been able to get a court to exonerate them.<br>

<p>When you support the death penalty you support the murder of innocent men and women.</p>

            <p>I’m with King_Kaddo.</p>
<p>What do we get by torturing people? I think death penalty is overused, but, even if you are going to kill a guy, why make him suffer? What do we get back?</p>
<p>It was already said in this thread that US states with death penalty have higher crime rates. I don’t think the reason is that death penalties bring violence. Instead, the cause is that the people in those states are more vengeful and vengefulness brings both violence and death penalty. I think that means there would be much less violence if people were less vengeful.</p>

</aside>
<p>Slightly less painful means slightly less bad which is still bad. You have the chance to be as good as possible and you still want to do the same bad thing? How stupid is that. If you have the chance to put off a fire with a single bucket of water why would you use a sligthly less big fire to put it off?</p>

            <p>I could get 4 years for pirating. If a pedophile has a good lawyer he can make him stay 4 years also. There was someone who wrote a book about executions. He sorted them to the level of pain. There is some special gas that makes you really high and fell into unconsciousness then you die. There is no way to do that wrong, unless you are a total idiot. A very high positioned person in the case of executions was asked if they could use that gas. He answererd with: “No, they have to die a painfull death.”</p>
<p>Killing a prisoner the same way he may killed his victim(s) makes yourself no more worth than the guy you actually killed.<br>
So I am for painless executions.</p>

            <p>Tiki: If that lawyer defended you in a murder trial when you know you didn’t kill the person, would you still think that lawyer to be “overpaid”?</p>

 Report and Recommendations on the Administration of the Death Penalty in California:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The resources that go into a death penalty case are enormous. The pursuit of execution adds millions at each phase of the process, from trial, to appeal, and habeas proceedings. For example, a death penalty trial costs counties at least $1.1 million more than a conventional murder trial. The state spends at least an additional $117 million a year on capital punishment, about half of it on prison expenses that exceed the usual costs of housing inmates and the rest on arguing and judging death penalty appeals.</p>
<p>The costs mount because death penalty trials and appeals take far longer than others, involve more lawyers, investigators and expert witnesses, and displace other cases from courtrooms. In contrast, adopting a maximum penalty of life without possibility of parole (for which there is growing sentiment) would incur only a fraction of the death penalty costs, including prison expenses.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Also, “lawyer costs” is a quick and easy copout.  Everyone makes lawyer jokes.  “What do you call 5 lawyers at the bottom of the sea?  A good start!”  However, those selfsame people that are critical of lawyers and lawyer fees are the first ones to run to a lawyer if they need them.</p>
<p>It’s been my saying for a long time: “Everyone hates lawyers until you need one.”</p>

            <p>the cycle repeats once more</p>
<p>edit: ^yeah except it takes years and years for execution to actually happen so those prisons and mouths to feed are there regardless (in addition to the massive amount of prisoners who wouldn’t get executed either way)</p>

<p>There have been many studies which show that lifetime incarceration is cheaper for the tax payer than the death penalty.  If you’d like, I can pull those studies but I think you can find them for yourself.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>The key difference is that with execution, digits are flipped into some lawyer’s bank account, while with life imprisonment, it just makes more mouths for tax-funded minimum wage cooks to feed, and increases the demand to build additional prisons due to their overpopulation and increased strain on prison guards.</p>
<p>If <span class="bbcode-i">those studies</span> you mentioned are accurate, then the only problem is that lawyers are paid too much.</p>

            <p>The reason legal costs for execution are so high is because <span class="bbcode-i">a person’s life depends on it</span>. It’s because they want to make absolutely sure they’ve got the right guy and that no procedure errors happen.</p>
<p>Of course it still happens regardless.</p>
