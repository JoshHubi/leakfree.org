    <title>The Anatomy of a Zombie...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-anatomy-of-a-zombie/4228</link>
    <description>So, let&#39;s get the point straight out of the way. We&#39;ve all seen that headcrabs (mainly) attack from in front. In fact, when Lamarr jumped on Barney, I&#39;m sure he got on from the front. So, may I ask, how do they end up facing the complete opposite direction on a zombie? I guess they can attack from the back, or turn, but it honestly just seems like they attack from the front.

Thoughts/Ideas/Topic closers go below. 
Unless you flipped your computer/monitor. Then they can go to the sides or above.</description>

<p>Following the latter, I’m marginally confused as to how a poison zombie manages to breed multiple poison headcrabs, while the other headcrabs don’t breed as quickly. Do Poison headcrab eggs hatch quicker?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>it seems how the combine have ‘‘evolved’’ them into poison/black and fast they have new habbilities but also they aren’t so good:</p>
<p>the fast headcrab can now run but when it get’s a victim it will destroy practically all of it letting just the bones and some dead meat for the worms. Also it’s more weak than the normal 1</p>
<p>The black/poison headcrab have a longer jumping range, has more hp than normal headcrabs and can attach to A victim’s back when 1 of it’s mates is on the head. But is slower than the normal headcrab and will only ‘‘run’’ (if we can call that lot of sh***t run) when got shot.</p>

<p>Well, since you asked your question initially extremely broadly, yes I think that people may keep talking about headcrab anatomy.</p>
<p>And yes, headcrabs actually USED to have eyes in HL1.<br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s still anatomy, physiology is chemistry and I doubt Valve actually thought it out.  Physiology would be something like headcrabs having high amounts of acetylcholinesterases in their blood, and when they latch onto a host they release them into the host’s brain, inhibiting neural function.</p>

            <p>Well, this explanation doesn’t work well for the zombines… I cant explain them… but as for the regular zombies I would say that the host is unconscious…</p>
<p>The zombies always talk backwards, a trait of our subconscious selves. <a href="https://mentalhealth.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=https://www.reversespeech.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://mentalhealth.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=https://www.reversespeech.com/</a></p>
<p>However since valve decieded that for some reason zombines had to be different, its hard to explain it without going hardcore sci-fi and saying that the headcrabs absorb the brain, thus giving them the knowledge of speech, and any sounds you hear are coming from the headcrab its self… But thats just lols.</p>
<p>Edit: I just got done actually reading what everyone else had to say…</p>

<p>I heard that the host is merely unconscious. Alive but unable to control the body. Hence the screaming noises. The headcrab needs the host to be alive.</p>

</aside>
<p>seems to be in agreement with what I said about their state of consciousness.</p>
<p>Oh, and this thread makes the Half Life zombies cooler  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  I always perceived them as being dead due to the fact that anyone who was just freshly coupled or those who have yet to zombify fully always appeared lifeless… Be it in Opposing Force or just after the test chamber in HL1. But yeah. Fun, trying to explain something with no actual explanation.</p>

<p>^ This. The brain and most of the head are preserved during zombification. Headcrab attaches to host’s nervous system trough the brain. Zombie and zombine sounds are produced using the human’s speech organs. Also, the host is still somewhat aware of itself, which suggests that their brain is indeed still present and not completely taken over by the headcrab.</p>

            <p>Awright, since nobody has answered OP’s question, I will.  From what I’ve seen in both HL2 and HL1, Headcrabs can rotate themselves and move around while mounted on a human head, as depicted on a headcrab wiggling around on a scientist’s head shortly after the RC in the beginning of Unforeseen Consequences.</p>

<p>Here’s something I noticed. You’d think that a normal zombie is just like any other, you HAVE to aim for the head, especially moreso with the headcrabs, it’s what’s making the person a zombie. But, you can shoot anywhere and still kill the zombie. How does that work, does the victim still need to be alive or what? If that’s the case, how do you explain fast zombies, which are already ROTTING, or the zombies who you cut in HALF and still come after you. Hell, when shooting fast zombies unless you aim for the head you’re just shooting bones and little bits of flesh.</p>
<p>So how does this work? The zombie physiology makes no sense.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I figured that the headcrab would detach because the body proved too weak, and would choose to rather mount something that managed to protect itself. I’m not so sure about why they keep going after someone cuts them in half.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have a little theory of how the headcrab and it’s host works:</p>
<p>The normal headcrab:</p>
<p>It gets attached to it’s host body without killing it but mutating it, after that it doesn’t really damage the brain only the nervous system of everything under the neck, after it it can controll it’s victims body without controlling the mouth or the eyes. How it also haven’t got eyes it maybe senses movement by something but that’s out of how I could work so I don’t care of how he sees you.</p>
<p>Normal headcrab on zombines:</p>
<p>It does like the normal zombie but how it’s victim has a helm it brokes it’s head and also controlls the victims comunicator.</p>
<p>The fast headcrab:</p>
<p>after being mutated by the combine this 1 is one of those wich doesn’t let even the brain of it’s victim, It controlls everything.</p>
<p>The black/poison headcrab:</p>
<p>same as fast but it can also attach to the victims back.</p>
<p>Gonome:</p>
<p>This isn’t a headcrab mutation. Is a zombie mutation caused by the radioactivity of black mesa after black mesa got nuked it has completely dissapeared… for now (maybe it will return in ep3?).</p>
<p>That’s all n thnx for readin’</p>

            <p>Haha. This has kind of gone off the original question, while staying true to the title. My question was how does the headcrab magically end up facing forwards after attack from the front which would end up with it facing backwards?</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">How to create it:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Place one Headcrab on the <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">living</span></span> Persons head.(If the host is dead, this may not work!)</li>
<li>Wait for it to finish the transformation.</li>
