    <title>Using &quot;say&quot; command in SP closes game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/using-say-command-in-sp-closes-game/15013</link>
    <description>Using the &quot;say&quot; command in Single Player closes the game immediately. Not even sure if that&#39;s really a &quot;crash&quot; or not.
You may wonder why I want to say something in SP? I keep the command &quot;say ^_^&quot; bound to mouse3 for multiplayer and I pressed it accidentally. I didn&#39;t test if this happens in Windows too.

Update: this happens for me on Windows and Linux.</description>
