    <title>Can someone help me?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/can-someone-help-me/10069</link>
    <description>I just recently installed the game and I&#39;ve been wanting to play it for a while. I get on and everything seems fine at first. I can get through the tram system at the start fine. Except at the end of it.  As soon as the door of the tram is about to be opened, my game crashes. This happens to me EVERY TIME! Can someone tell me if there is a way to fix this or not?</description>

<p>TBH, in case the game is crashing a lot on your rig - most probably you’ve got something wrong with your PC. Yeah, it’s possible that the bug is in BMS, but it’s not that probable: thousands of people all around the world are able to play this game without frequent crashes (for example I’ve got crashes only in case I mess up a log with advanced cvar settings in console - which is OK, as HL2 and Co would also crash if you frequently do something like several changes to mat_dxlevel or mat_parralax/mat_bumpmap). Thus chances are that something with either your software or hardware making the game to crash. It could be faulty memory, faulty GPU, faulty motherboard with VRM not able to feed enough power to CPU/DIMM, faulty power supply which is not able to provide enough power for system under huge load and so on. It could be that your system is towards lower end of minimal system requirements for BMS and, for example, it simply hits the exhaustion of the heap pool (out of free memory condition) and starts swapping. It could be as simple as outdated/buggy drivers for your GPU or soundcard. I.e. it’s good that you posted the minidump here and it’d be cool if you would keep on posting them here after each crash you have in the game, but be warned that first of all you should check your PC to be OK as most of the BMS players don’t get a lot of frequent unexpected crashes on their rigs.</p>

<p>My computer can usually play most games perfectly. I got it to work again after that first crash, and played for like 4 hours up until the point when you get the the chapter called Questionable Ethics. I got to the pint where you kill the soldiers in the courtyard thing with the security guard. I get halfway across, and the game crashes. I haven’t tried to get back on to see if it works again. I’ll post the minidump here though now. Though, I’m not sure if I’m doing it right.<br>

<p>Crashes:<br>
Every time the game crashes, it will create an MDMP (minidump) file in your SteamApps\username\source sdk base 2007 folder. Your crash will be the newest entry in that folder. If you attach the file to your report, it will help us track down and solve the issue.</p>
