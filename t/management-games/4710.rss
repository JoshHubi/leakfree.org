    <description>I feel the need to waste massive chunks of my life again, and nothing can achieve that in quite the same way as a good management game

I&#39;ve played all the Simcity series, and Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 and 3, and thoroughly enjoyed them. Can any of you fine people recommend something else to try?</description>

JPOG is pretty easy to mod if you know what you’re doing. You can Change prices of items, Research time, Tour Vehicle maximum altitude/range, Change the models of the guests to those of the dinosaurs, all from the source files (which are text files, easily re-written).</p>
