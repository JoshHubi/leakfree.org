    <title>Loading times/menu freeze</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/loading-times-menu-freeze/11091</link>
    <description>Hi, wouldn&#39;t it be possible to somehow reduce the time it takes to load a new map? I know that it&#39;s an engine limitation, but still...
My brother has a high-end PC and still it&#39;s like this.
Why can&#39;t I and others choose multi-core rendering option?

Also sometimes when I press escape and want to save/load, it &quot;freezes&quot; and takes 10-15 seconds for the window to show up.

It kinda breaks the immersion.</description>

            <p>It’s likely due to the old engine or something.</p>

<p>Ha Ha,I have the same as you, mines an HP Envy 17.5" 3290NR 3D.<br>
This game runs flawlessly on my notebook.<br>
As for the multicore,<br>
I HAVE done the tutorial and allowed all but 1 core and it still will not utilize 7 cores.<br>

I use Process Explore, it’s better than Task Manager.</p>

As for the graph, BMS is running in the background and I have windows open, the game is NOT on pause.<br>
I have the same map loading wait as you.</p>

You really are arrogant and should have your posting privileges revoked.</p>

<p>What’s your definition of “high-end PC”? And what’s your definition of the long loading time? It is 5 seconds? Or 10? Or, maybe, 5 minutes, as had been reported in other thread?<br>

<p>Maybe it’s somehow connected with inability to use forum search function to get the answers on frequently asked questions?

<p>Provide your system specs please and follow reporting guidelines. It might be RAM shortage with your system doing a lot of swapping during these 10-15 seconds, or it could be something else. Posting console log captured right after hitting this “pause” could be helpful in diagnosing your problem.</p>
