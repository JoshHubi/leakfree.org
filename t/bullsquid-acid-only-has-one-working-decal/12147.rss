    <title>Bullsquid acid only has one working decal?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bullsquid-acid-only-has-one-working-decal/12147</link>
    <description>Yeah when the bullsquid spits only one decal from the multiple acid balls is printed. Idk what caused this as the game was working fine earlier. It seems that every time I do a playthrough I get new bugs. If anyone has a fix for this please post.</description>
