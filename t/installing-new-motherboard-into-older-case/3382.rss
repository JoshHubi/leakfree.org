    <title>Installing new motherboard into older case</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/installing-new-motherboard-into-older-case/3382</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m tasked with helping my brother install a new motherboard into his old case.  He bought an HP Pavilion a1410n a while ago and now wants to upgrade.

However, now here comes the issue.  On the case, there is a plate with holes for all the motherboard accessories (mouse, USB, onboard sound, onboard video, LAN, etc).  The plate works for the current motherboard, but the new motherboard has a slightly different configuration (instead of a digital audio out jack, there&#39;s a serial port).  The motherboard comes with a replacement plate for the motherboard, but I don&#39;t know how to get the original plate out.  He doesn&#39;t have the original motherboard manual and searching the HP website was fruitless.  So was Google.  So, I&#39;m seeking help from anonymous people now.   :wink: 

Does anyone know how to remove that back plate from the case?  I don&#39;t want to break the case trying to force it out.</description>

            <p>I’ll try it when he brings the case back over, probably later today.  Thank you very much!</p>

            <p>The original plate should just pop out with a little bit of force once the motherboard is removed.</p>
