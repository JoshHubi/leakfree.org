    <title>The G-man between Half Life 1 and 2?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-g-man-between-half-life-1-and-2/2536</link>
    <description>There are many things I wonder about with the G-man, but something I hope is discussed in the upcoming game(s) is what the G-man did between the time Gordon walks into that glowy green ball and the time that Gordon wakes up in the train to City 17/Nova Prospekt.

What did the G-man do in that intervening time?  What brought me to this question is that I was thinking about that horrendous fanfic of Opposing Force I was writing that stalled before I could formulate a plot...  If the events of OF are canon (let&#39;s say that the majority of the events are, for the sake of argument), then, after the G-man puts Gordon in stasis, he also transport Adrian somewhere.  My horrendous fanfic had Adrian waking up in the Aperture Science Enrichment Facility where he was to be jailed inside of the glass box.

When GLaDOS realizes that he&#39;s there, she dispatches a team to go collect him, but the Combine come before they can get there and the 7-Hour War begins.   They try to stop the invasion themselves, but GLaDOS has other ideas and a countdown begins with GLaDOS flooding the facility with a deadly neurotoxin.  The test subjects, including Adrian, are safe in their &quot;relaxation vaults&quot;.  To stop GLaDOS, they install a morality core, but it&#39;s too late.  The countdown reaches zero and the neurotoxin floods the facility and kills the personnel....and the Combine that are in the facility.

But that&#39;s as far as I got.

tl;dr, My question is, what do you think the G-man did during the intervening time between the events of Half Life 1 and 2?  Just sit and observe?  Facility the invasion?  Give Alyx the plans for DOG?  I&#39;d like to hear some ideas.   :slight_smile:</description>

<p>Were you being serious or sarcastic in that last part?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I wouldn’t dare saying my writing is awesome, I’m pretty sure there are far better writers out there than I am. But yeah, I’m particularly proud of that paragraph, at the beginning of chapter three:</p>
<p>(Earlier in my fic, Gordon and Alyx crash landed in a small abandoned Combine base in the Arctic called Outpost 17, the chopper filled with guns, and they were attacked by an Advisor.)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">But Gordon didn’t exactly pay attention to the loss in weapons they had suffered; what was the most urgent to find for now was the mind devices. Unfortunately, they were bound to be buried under the pile of debris and unstable ammo scattered on the ground in front of them. The Advisor could still be out there, waiting in the shadows. After their long voyage without being attacked by Combine units, he had kind of lowered his defense, but the attack of the Advisor made him fully alert again. Their cruel might and amorality in warfare struck once again Gordon’s thoughts in terror; he <span class="bbcode-i">feared</span> them again. For the past week of trip he had lost the use to fight hordes of trans-human soldiers with the blue or red windows glowing like the livid eyes of Death himself, or the towering, intimidating presence of a spider-like, three-legged Strider shouting out deafening, whaling noises, thumping and chest-stabbing its way to him while firing its deadly repeater gun. He was again aware of their vicious back-stabbing tactics, and he was ready for <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> from their part now. All of these Rebels had seen him killing off quite a couple of them in a row at the City or while defending White Forest and saw in him a liberator, a knight in a shiny armor, but he dreaded the Combine just as much as <span class="bbcode-i">they</span> did. He was just an MIT graduate with a high-tech hazard suit and a crowbar, <span class="bbcode-i">for Christ’s sake</span>.</span></p>
<p>At least, that’s fifteen lines in MS Word.</p>
<p>On topic: I think the G-Man simply went home to play <span class="bbcode-i">Sims</span> for the next twenty years like a no-life. :retard:</p>
<p>No offense to <span class="bbcode-i">Sims</span> players there.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t mean to look offensive, but, you got a problem with fan fictions? :mean: I don’t think you do, since you seem to be interested in one. Maybe you simply found the more crappy, badly written ones? Alas, there are quite a couple of them around the Internet.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, I’m writing one myself as well, and I try to make it as complete and true to the Half-Life universe as possible, and (no false modesty here) A LOT better written than most others. Heck, in the third chapter, I have like fifteen lines of text just to describe how Gordon feels about the Combine.</p>

            <p>I bet Valve has thought about Gordon’s sleep issue. So it just miiight be possible they open Episode 3 with a ‘fade in’ of Gordon sitting/napping on the helicopter, and Alyx being the pilot (and an obsessed and emotional wreck).</p>

</aside>
<p>Depending on how long Half-Life 1 is in terms of days he has probably gone five or maybe six days without sleep.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2 is around three days and two nights long if I’m not mistaken. Episode 1 is probably happening on the third day as well. What I can’t decide upon is wether or not a night has passed during the time between Episode 1 and 2, or the third night being somewhere in Episode 2 (like when you’re down in the mines).</p>

<p>Right. Alyx was “a child” at the time of the Black Mesa incident and is presumbly somewhere in her early to mid-twenties in Half Life 2. So we can assume somewhere between 10 and 20 years have passed, but that’s about as good an indication as I think we get.</p>

            <p>Eli never explicitly said 10 years, but valve has implied it was somewhere around 10-20 years that had passed, so he’s not completely wrong.</p>
