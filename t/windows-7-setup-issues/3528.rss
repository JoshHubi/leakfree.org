    <title>Windows 7 setup issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-7-setup-issues/3528</link>
    <description>So I recently bought myself a copy of windows 7, but while trying to install the setup seems to fail. 
It gets to the first reboot, and continues fine. When it gets to the point where it says &#39;setup completing&#39; it hangs for about a minute and then the screen goes blank. I left it for quite a while, nothing happened. When I reboot the screen also goes blank after the windows load screen. 

Any help?
(n.b. I&#39;m using upgrade media)</description>

<p>It sounds like something else, BUT I have had to let a computer wait 30-45 minutes for it to get past that part. From what I had read there are some compatibility issues where it goes through trying every graphic display option internally one by one until it just decides to use a default one. Once you update the computer this glitch goes away.</p>

<p>Tried. I don’t think it was successful (Someone smart shut the computer down &gt;_&gt;). If it was successful they probably would have left it (Then again, they could have walked in the room 5 mins after I left)</p>
<p>From some reading, this seems to be the solution:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I have recently resolved my black ascreen issue, Dale or ManUPhilip’s answers were meaningless to me.</p>
<p>The problem lies with the graphics card and Motherboard. I researched into this and found out that the newest drivers for the 7, 8 or 9 nvidia series graphics card along with an asus motherboard gives you the black screen due to the “physixs” system.</p>
<p>My solution consisted of using my old nVidia series 7500GT graphics (or you can try onboard graphcis), installed Windows 7 (it’ll work as long as you aren’t using a series 8 or 9 card). Once windows booted, install the oldest set of drivers that supports your nVidia 8 or 9 series card (I used the 175.65 driver set), power off your pc, plug in your nVidia series 8 or 9 graphics card and it’ll work.</p>
<p>The only problem with this method is if you need to re-install Windows 7, you’ll have to re-do the above steps. For me, I just bought an extra series 7 nVidia card and SLI’d the two cards together to replace my nVidia 9 card which I sold.</p>
<p>Hope this helps your problem too</p>

</aside>
<p>Only I don’t have onboard graphics or a spare card to test with.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Thanks to FireTime I’ve managed to fix the issue  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
