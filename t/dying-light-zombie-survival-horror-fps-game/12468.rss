    <title>Dying Light Zombie Survival/Horror FPS Game</title>

    <description>Here&#39;s some info on Dying Light:

Techland announces the opening of a new development studio in Canada, which includes some of the folks from Radical Entertainment who lost their jobs last summer. They explain how this studio fits into their organization: &quot;Up until now, titles by Techland have been created in two development studios, located in Wroclaw and Warsaw, Poland. Those studios are now joined by the new facility, located near Vancouver, Canada. The new branch, named Digital Scapes Studios, is led by Managing Director Marcin Chady, previously longtime Technical Director of Radical Entertainment, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard. From the same source are a number of other employees of the new Techland owned Canadian studio. Team members previously contributed to titles such as two installments in the best-selling Prototype series, which was enthusiastically received by players and media alike. Digital Scapes Studios are currently tasked with the creation of certain key elements in the new game Dying Light, currently in development by Techland in partnership with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.&quot; Speaking of Dying Light, a new video offers the first look at gameplay in the upcoming first-person, zombie survival/horror game. The day/night cycle is a significant factor in the game, and this &quot;pre-alpha&quot; clip focuses on what players can do in the clear light of day.

Here&#39;s a link to the first gameplay trailer:

            <p>I’m actually kind of with Idi on this one. Dying Light looks fairly interesting as well as some other zombie games coming out right about now, but the whole zombie genre ran its course (and then just kept going like everyone was too embarrassed to tell it it should stop) over two years ago. Why’d the good games have to come out well after the genre went stale?</p>
