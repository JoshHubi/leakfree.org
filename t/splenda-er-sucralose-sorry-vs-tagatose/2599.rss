    <title>Splenda (Er, sucralose, sorry) vs Tagatose</title>

    <description>[TITLE CORRECTION:  SPLENDA vs Other sweeteners.

I just chose Tagatose as my example of another possible sweetener.]

****
Discuss.

I think Splenda is the most vile sugar-&quot;substitute&quot; in the world.  It&#39;s manufactured by chlorinating (as in Chlorine from a POOL) sugar molecules so our body can&#39;t absorb the calories.

Before you respond, look up tagatose.  Learn about it from other places than wikipedia&#39;s stub of an article.


I mean, Tagatose (left-handed sugar molecules produced as a byproduct of dairy products) is showing promise as not only a sugar supplement, but as a way to deter, reduce, and even REVERSE the onset of Diabetes, among other positive reactions.  And it has 90-or-so% the flavor of sugar, and our body can only absorb a third or so of the calories, due to its left-handed-ness.

No I didn&#39;t get that from wikipedia, I&#39;ve been following tagatose for about years now.  If you can find the full story of Tagatose&#39;s development, it&#39;s a funny read.  The whole thing was an accident, shipping error, actually.

Oh, and unlike splenda, you can ACTUALLY bake (healthily) with tagatose.

The unfortunate thing about tagatose is that as of right now, it&#39;s difficult to get a hold of.  The company (Spherix) seems to have gone innactive.  Eventually some other company will claim public domain on it and then copyright it for themselves, such is the US&#39;s wonderful economic system.


Of course, as long as your not diabetic, there&#39;s always good old fashioned sugar.</description>

<p>Are you talking about the element chlorine or the mixture chlorine?  Cause if it’s the former, I would stay away from salt, as well, since that is made up of not only chlorine but also a very unstable metal!</p>

            <p>Sucralose doesn’t even stay in your body for more than a couple days.</p>
<p>Your body does not recognize it as a sugar, so therefore it does not cause an insulin response (unlike some other sweeteners such as Aspartame). Only a small fraction of sucralose ingested actually enters the bloodstream, wherin it is promptly filtered by the kidneys and ejected in the urine. The vast majority of sucralose in your system exits the body via poo, as the gastrointestinal tract has little interest in a substance that constitutes almost zero caloric value and is otherwise inert.</p>
<p>Only 3.7% of the substance injested is actually metabolized, and vigorous scientific studies have proven that the metabolization of sucrose is perfectly harmless in reasonable doses.</p>
<p>What does reasonable mean? While, one specific study that indicated a slight decrease in the weight of the Thymus (an organ responsible for autoimmunity amongst other things) was dealing out doses to the mice equal to a human being eating 17,200 packets of sucralose per day.</p>
<p>In other words: Splenda. is. <span class="bbcode-i">safe</span>.</p>
<p>As far as the taste differences are concerned, thats another matter entirely. If all we have to debate about with sweeteners is which one is the closest to the taste of sugar, I think we are doing pretty good, haha.</p>

            <p>It’s not just that, but it doesn’t work the same.  I’ve had splenda cupcakes… or were they muffins?  I think they were muffins…  I dunno, some sort of baked good with splenda, and it didn’t rise correctly and was…  splenda-y.  I don’t like the splenda flavor.  Perhaps 600% sugar-flavor is just a big too much for me.  And then there’s the whole it-makes-me-thirsty-thing, yet nothing quenches that thirst other than more splenda…  So I avoid it nevertheless.</p>
