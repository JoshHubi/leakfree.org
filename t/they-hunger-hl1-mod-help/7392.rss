    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/they-hunger-hl1-mod-help/7392</link>
    <description>So for the past few days I have been trying to downlaod &quot;They Hunger&quot; onto my computer. I send it to the half-life folder in the steammaps folder each time but it has a message that says &quot;it is in use&quot; even though im not using it. Any help would be appriciated. I really want to play this mod!
p.s. My computer runs on Windows 7.</description>

            <p>I only have the steam version unortunatly, i’ll try closing down some things in task manager and ill give the exact message.</p>
<p>EDIT:Here is the error message, when i click either yes or no it just flashes back up, i can only click cancel.</p>
<p>An error occurred extracting C:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steammaps\brockley44\half-life\Hunger\cl_dlls\client.dll (this file might currently be in use). Would you like to try copying the file again?</p>

            <p>Also, if you have a non-steam copy of Half-Life, play it on that.  I’ve got Half-Life on Steam, but I only ever play the WON version.</p>

            <p>What is in use? Try to be more specific. CTRL + ALT + Delete and go into processes to see if you can end whatever is in use, then try to move the mod.</p>
