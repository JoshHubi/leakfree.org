    <title>Beeping keys/stuttering bug solution</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/beeping-keys-stuttering-bug-solution/11248</link>
    <description>If it&#39;s happened to you, you know what I&#39;m talking about, almost every keystroke gives a beep and multiple cause a stutter making it almost unplayable.  My solution was to move all the assigned keys one to the right.  The problem seemed to be tied to either the Shift or Ctrl key.  Haven&#39;t had a problem since, give it a try.</description>

<p>You’re hitting your ‘modifer’ key too much. It’s the key that turns sticky keys on. Stop bumping your ctrl/shift key so much. You probably have a bad habit of tapping it like a controller button or something.</p>
<p>You ‘hold’ shift, and ‘press’ ctrl.<br>
Or vice versa. You don’t tap them repeatedly for anything. No game ever requires you to tap either key because this issue you’re explaining happens.</p>
<p>Other than that if you also have ‘console gaming’ tendencies you can be holding 2 keys together that make noises. For instance on an older keyboard holding down the ‘down key’ and the ‘left’ key made my computer beep repeatedly. But holding any other combination of arrow keys didn’t.</p>
<p>Have you guys changed the default movement bound keys to the arrow keys? Use ‘W, A, S ,D’</p>

            <p>You could probably turn off the actual beep somehow, but the stuttering when it happens you’re not going to be able to get rid of.  What you’re running into is not a bug, it’s a normal hardware feature.</p>
<p>Every input device has a maximum amount of input signals it can process at once.  The amount of keys you can press on keyboards simultaneously isn’t unlimited.  Getting another keyboard might be a good solution.  As you’ve found out, it also helps to use less function keys (ctrl, alt, shift, etc) as those often seem trigger the beep/freeze quicker.</p>
