    <title>Soldier&#39;s grenades.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/soldiers-grenades/11526</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve managed to get all the achievements. But there&#39;s an exception: the one where you have to kill a soldier with his own grenade. And the problem is that, I can&#39;t get them to throw me grenades. They just shoot at me, I wait for them to throw a grenade, but they don&#39;t and instead they kill me. I don&#39;t know what to do, is there any way to make them use their grenades?</description>

            <p>Well I made it, although I was a suicide attack. It seems like soldiers only throw grenades when they know the enemy is there but can’t see him. So hiding in inaccessible place(at least for them) like a ventilation shaft and after a while they’ll start using their grenades. Then you just pick one and run on them, and blow.</p>

            <p>I remember when I first reached the surface in We’ve Got Hostiles I stood in the freight elevator too long &amp; in a few seconds I was surrounded by grenades. (It also auto-saved right there) You could try replaying that part.</p>
