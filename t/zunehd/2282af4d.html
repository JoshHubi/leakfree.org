My brother bought one and I am using it right now. 
It doesn’t have very many apps but audiosurf tilt is far better than any iPod app I have seen. It has a higher resolution screen. its accelerometer is faster.&amp;hellip;">

          <p>Don’t think so. I’m still trying to work with the Campus IT to get the Zune’s MAC address passed the Cisco Clean Access software so I can use it with my personal wireless access point I set up in my Suite.</p>
<p>All I know is, when I updated the Zune software on my desktop and restarted it, something like 250 new files were found and imported. I was wondering what the hell they were till I checked the videos and noticed all my DIVX .avi movies and TV shows that were previously unsupported were the culprits.</p>
<p>I’m suprised Microsoft hasn’t included Silverlight support. Netflix streaming support would be a huge plus. Though the battery would die extremely fast doing so.</p>

<p>Well fine, if I’m the one throwing insults, you’re the one throwing childish namecalling into the mix. Calling me a “macfag” and calling my arguments bullshit is hardly the epitome of maturity.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]I call your arguments bullshit because that is exactly what they are, and explain why they are.</p>
<p>And no, debating is not arguing held as a sport. Arguments are intrinsically unsupported, usually accompanied by yelling and completely unsupported viewpoints. Debating is where both people, using evidence and objective opinions, attempt to reach a solution to the initial question asked. All I’ve been trying to do is introduce some <span class="bbcode-i">actual evidence</span> (but as has been pointed out, it is still lacking - I’ll do my best to find some actual stats on performance), and temper some of your extremely subjectively biased nonsense.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]<a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS360US361&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:debate&amp;ei=2hthS-6JJ5TWtgPEru25Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=glossary_definition&amp;ct=title&amp;ved=0CAcQkAE" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Definition: debate</a> Almost every one of the top definitions use the word argument. A debate is a type of argument, it may have a much more positive connotation, but it’s still a type of argument.</p>
<p>I’m not particularly insulting you when I just describe your actions. You say things like “oh, the Music app is just thrown in with the rest of the apps on a random page that takes you ages to find” and “Audiosurf Tilt is better than every single iTouch app out there”, which are both quantifiably WRONG. On the iTouch, the Music button is on a separate bar on the bottom of the page, shown as soon as you turn it on. I played Audiosurf Tilt, and while I thought it was fun, there’s no way it can measure up to the awesomeness (as well as the sheer quantity) of iTouch/iPhone games.</p>
<p>I believe in the original post I believe I said audiosurf tilt was better than FREE ipod games. It’s an opinion, but one I’m sure most of us can agree on.</p>
<p>The main reason that the iTouch will <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> have a bigger base than the Zune is because it has the iPhone’s hardware, which means it has the iPhone’s apps. That means that a) it has a larger support base (because it has, in effect, twice as many users) and b) it has more prospects for developers (because, twice as many users means twice as many potential consumers), and hence more developers will develop apps for it.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]This is true, but it’s also true that people don’t buy ZuneHD’s because<br>
a) they’ve never even heard of them let alone seen one.<br>
b) They already have ipods and are blindly loyal to ipod (this is you)<br>
To support a) and b), my brother went around showing his ZuneHD to people when he bought it. The majority of people who didn’t own an mp3 player or didn’t care about them that much agreed that the ZuneHD was better than the itouch. EVERY person who already had an itouch said that the ZuneHD was shit and the itouch was better.</p>
<p>Also, ZuneHD supports user made games ipod touch doesn’t so if ZuneHD kicks off, (which it has at my school) the number of apps will grow.</p>

<p>Okay, let’s have a look at those two reasons:</p>
<p>a) Well, why is that? I’ve never seen one in Australia, and I bet a lot of people haven’t seen them because</p>
<p>b) Oh come off it. I know plenty of people who own ipods that are still objective about their choice. I own an iPod Classic, and I know a ton of people who now own iPods, and they were extremely <span class="bbcode-i">objective</span> in their approach. As was I. I looked at all the available products that I wanted, and then decided that the iPod Classic was the best value for money. In hindsight I still don’t think I would’ve gone with the iTouch, mainly because I like my 120GB and longer battery life. But at the time, I didn’t have the Zune to consider.</p>
<p>If you’re criticising people because they don’t throw their iTouches on the ground and stomp on them in disgust and immediately go and buy a Zune, then I think you really need to go and think about your position. People who already own iTouches can still argue that they’re not as good as the Zune, but they’re hardly going to agree to just throw theirs away and buy a different (and almost identical) product.</p>
<p>But if you think that every iTouch owner is an immediate ‘macfag’ and loves everything Apple makes, then perhaps you should consider the possibility that given that they’ve used the iTouch much more extensively than you, they objectively view it as better.</p>
<p>And even if we accept your argument as true, perhaps you should consider that the opposite is also true; because you own a Zune you are now so hopelessly in love with Zune that you will never consider another piece of hardware ever again.</p>

<p>But you don’t. You just say things like “iPods are unintuitive” and when I explain why they are, in fact, very intuitive, you call my arguments bullshit and move on.</p>

Perhaps they’ve never used a ZuneHD and the fact that all they’ve used is an ipod touch shows that they are biased. Saying your unbiased is silly. It’s almost impossible to be truly objective in such a situation. I consider 2 equal but opposite biases much much better than one failed attempt at objectivity.</p>
<p>And even if we accept your argument as true, perhaps you should consider that the opposite is also true; because you own a Zune you are now so hopelessly in love with Zune that you will never consider another piece of hardware ever again.</p>

<p>Now, you see, you can’t make an argument like this. You can’t say “the Zune, objectively, is better than the iTouch because it has Audiosurf Tilt” and then say “oh no, but any iTouch games you list that may be better than that are just better in your mind”. The point of this thread is to objectively discuss the Zune, not work out exactly what games you like.</p>

<p>Gah, need to remember to finish sentences.</p>

<p>Did I SAY that I never considered any other media players? No. I owned an iRiver H340, which was shocking. My sister owned a Samsung…thing…which was shocking. My friend owned a Creative…thing…which was slightly less shocking, but the wheel was still bad. I reached the decision to buy an iPod based on objective analysis of the market at the time, which didn’t include a Zune (because they just weren’t available), and hence I narrowed the choice down to either an iTouch or an iPod classic.</p>

<p>And if you had properly explained the reasons for your decision, then I would’ve listened. But instead you brought up such wonderful reasons as “oh, the iTouch’s list of apps is unintuitive” or “Audiosurf Tilt is better than ANY game on iTouch” or “iTunes is shit because its unintuitive”. If you give me actual reasons as to why the iTouch is worse, then I’ll hear them. Things like the screen? Yes, the screen is better. The ability to output in HD? Nice for some, but useless for me. But the lack of apps, the worse internet browsing (as someone here stated), and the fact that I’m so hopelessly in love with Apple that I want nothing more than to have Steve Jobs’ babies mean that I can’t bring myself to buy one.</p>

</aside>
<p>Huh? Quality? Picture quality maybe, but actual quality of hardware? Please. You haven’t shown any reason why its better other than “iTouch is unintuitive” and when I tried to explain otherwise you dismissed my arguments as silly and wrong.</p>
<p>And I’m on an iTouch RIGHT NOW and I can tell you that there are user made iTouch apps. For more information see <a href="https://www.onlinecolleges.net/2009/04/14/15-iphone-apps-created-by-college-students/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://tnerd.com/2009/02/13/an-iphone-app-developer-who-made-600000-in-a-month/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/138966/2009/02/app_management.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. Took a 30 second Google search. What website were YOU on?</p>
<p>And I’m just going to dismiss your word-of-mouth argument out of hand. The only chance the Zune has to break into the market is if it can show itself to be a better product than Apple such that it can actually compete with the iTouch. It needs to have more apps. It needs to advertise. It needs to have better web browsing and implement some of the things on the to-do list. If it does that, then maybe, MAYBE it’ll be better than the iTouch, but I still have to get my hands on one first.</p>

          <p>Well, about the Flash thing. W3C has been proposing HTML5 to be used as global standard (the standard that every browser but IE follows) for web browsing. HTML5 has been called to life to close the gap that things like Flash (and Silverlight and some Java players, etc). Once HTML5 goes mainstream, the need for these extra plugins will stop.</p>
<p>These plugins aren’t the most stable things around, and webpages crashing on any type of browser can often be related to them, so my guess would be that Apple has a lot of trust in HTML5 becoming a new standard fast, so they probably won’t bother getting these plugins in and risk possible bugs. I’m not saying this is a good idea, because Flash will still be needed for some content, but the majority of current flash content wouldn’t require the actual presence of Flash.</p>
<p>Now. If you turn the table towards the ZuneHD. Seeing as it’s from Microsoft, it probably has Internet Explorer. Microsoft is infamous for their total lack of support for the W3C standard. That’s mainly why IE is considered one of the worst browsers around. So if HTML5 goes mainstream, and Microsoft still assumes it knows best on how to interpret HTML, IE might get some issues with a lot of websites stepping away from Flash and going for the HTML5 way of delivering Flash-based content. I’m not saying this will happen, but it could, and it wouldn’t surprise me if it did. Unless Microsoft finally realizes that they have no business in trying to change the web on their own, rather than following global standards like any other browser.</p>

<p>Now, you see, you can’t make an argument like this. You can’t say “the Zune, objectively, is better than the iTouch because it has Audiosurf Tilt” and then say “oh no, but any iTouch games you list that may be better than that are just better in your mind”. The point of this thread is to objectively discuss the Zune, not work out exactly what games you like.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]I feel Audiosurf tilt is better than any free ipod touch game and I bet many other people would agree with me because<br>
a)not very many free ipod touch games are 3d<br>
b)many of the 3d ones are crippled versions of a pay game<br>
c)no ipod touch game I know of can take any song on your ipod and use it to determine the game set up<br>
I went to the most popular free apps on the ipod touch and skimmed through them and odwnloaded quite a few without finding one that I felt came close to audiosurf tilt.</p>
<p>Gah, need to remember to finish sentences.</p>
<p>And you know what? This will spell the failure of the Zune. If Microsoft doesn’t advertise it and the iTouch has already reach domination of the market, then how on early with the Zune make any kind of noticeable headway?</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]By people like me buying them and showing them to our friends. Just yesterday I got another person to buy a ZuneHD. People like them, they just don’t know about them. So as more people get them, it will create a snowball effect. this may or may not happen, but either way, this topic is which is better, not which is more popular.</p>
<p>Did I SAY that I never considered any other media players? No. I owned an iRiver H340, which was shocking. My sister owned a Samsung…thing…which was shocking. My friend owned a Creative…thing…which was slightly less shocking, but the wheel was still bad. I reached the decision to buy an iPod based on objective analysis of the market at the time, which didn’t include a Zune (because they just weren’t available), and hence I narrowed the choice down to either an iTouch or an iPod classic.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]I believe Zunes were around before the itouch, so if you were considering an itouch at the time Zunes must also have been on the market.</p>
<p>And if you had properly explained the reasons for your decision, then I would’ve listened. But instead you brought up such wonderful reasons as “oh, the iTouch’s list of apps is unintuitive” or “Audiosurf Tilt is better than ANY game on iTouch” or “iTunes is shit because its unintuitive”. If you give me actual reasons as to why the iTouch is worse, then I’ll hear them. Things like the screen? Yes, the screen is better. The ability to output in HD? Nice for some, but useless for me. But the lack of apps, the worse internet browsing (as someone here stated), and the fact that I’m so hopelessly in love with Apple that I want nothing more than to have Steve Jobs’ babies mean that I can’t bring myself to buy one.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]It has a faster accelerometer, the browser isn’t as bad as you would like to think, they’ve updated it. The audio, according to a person on this thread, is better, the battery life is better, it’s smaller and lighter, it feels better in your hand (IMO) and it looks better (IMO). Also, the silver backing to the ipod gets covered in smudges and fingerprints really easily, while you don’t notice fingerprints and smudges on the back of a ZuneHD very well. Also, something I can’t believe I forgot to mention, I hate the power button on the ipodtouch soooooooooooo much. It sticks out and is really really really easy to press. I don’t know how many times I’ve been playing a game on an ipodtouch and accidently pressed the power button. I’ve seen soooo many ipodtouches with cracked screens, os I wouldn’t be surprised at all to if I heard that the ZuneHD has a stronger screen (I’m not saying this is a fact, I’m just speculating that this is probably true). Also a speculation, I think it has better graphics. You don’t have to pay to update it. It runs on Zune software which, as we have already gone over, is better than itunes in everyone’s opinions but yours. You can easily share your songs and videos with other people’s Zunes and computers. It has Zune pass. The list goes on.</p>
<p>But a quick bit on Zune pass, it’s 15 bucks a month, and you can dl unlimited songs on your computer and your device as long as you keep paying. Each month you get to choose ten songs you’ll keep even if you stop paying. And, the most important part, Zune pass works with 3 Zunes and 3 computers, so if you can find two friends with Zunes, you can split the cost of one Zune pass and get unlimited music for 5 dollars a month.</p>
<p>Huh? Quality? Picture quality maybe, but actual quality of hardware? Please. You haven’t shown any reason why its better other than “iTouch is unintuitive” and when I tried to explain otherwise you dismissed my arguments as silly and wrong.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]See the above paragraph.</p>
<p>And I’m on an iTouch RIGHT NOW and I can tell you that there are user made iTouch apps. For more information see <a href="https://www.onlinecolleges.net/2009/04/14/15-iphone-apps-created-by-college-students/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://tnerd.com/2009/02/13/an-iphone-app-developer-who-made-600000-in-a-month/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/138966/2009/02/app_management.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. Took a 30 second Google search. What website were YOU on?</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]I read that there were no user made apps on a site, I trusted the site which I have now discovered was a mistake.</p>
<p>And I’m just going to dismiss your word-of-mouth argument out of hand. The only chance the Zune has to break into the market is if it can show itself to be a better product than Apple such that it can actually compete with the iTouch. It needs to have more apps. It needs to advertise. It needs to have better web browsing and implement some of the things on the to-do list. If it does that, then maybe, MAYBE it’ll be better than the iTouch, but I still have to get my hands on one first.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]The argument isn’t whether or not it’s popular or a financial success, but whether or not it’s better. It does need all those things and I bet it will do all those things. And once again, they’ve already made their web browser better, it’s still not as good as the iTouch’s, but it isn’t terrible. And advertising doesn’t make a product better, though I’m not surprised you think that seeing as you’re in love with macs.</p>

<p>So basically your point is that there isn’t an Audiosurf Tilt game on iTouch. True. There is, however, TapTap Revenge, which is free. Its basically like Guitar Hero for iTouch, and is based on the same very basic principle as Audiosurf; music rhythm. And guess what? Because the guys over at TapTap pre-prepare all of the tracks you play in-game, they’re always going to be more accurate to the music and more fun to play than games that generate rhythm patterns on the fly.</p>
<p>Your point about no 3D games on the iTouch is just completely fallacy, given that Audiosurf itself isn’t really a 3D game; it just makes the background look further away from the foreground - something that TapTap does equally well, and something that arcade games have been doing since the 80s.</p>

<p>Uhhh, no. The ZuneHD was announced in mid 2009; I got my iPod classic in late 2008. What’s more, Zunes in general aren’t marketed in Australia, let alone sold at major outlets. I didn’t even know they existed, aside from passing comments as to how bad they were, but I certainly didn’t see any sold at major retail outlets here.</p>

<p>Actually, if you look at comparisons between the iTouch and the Zune (actual objective ones, you know, where they actually get some statistics and test the players), you’ll see that the audio is the same, the prices are the same, the battery lives are just about the same, the Zune is smaller (which is a BAD thing in terms of screen size), the Zune is a tad lighter (but at those weights the difference truly is negligible), and I seriously don’t understand how an accelerometer can be ‘faster’, given that its just measuring the rate at which the player accelerates.</p>
<p>And the power button? I have no answer to your own incompetence. I’ve never found it to be a problem, and nor do any of the owners of iTouches or iPhones I know. But that’s not definitive; I just don’t know what will actually give a definitive answer on this topic, other than to say I don’t see it as a big issue.</p>
<p>And true, you don’t have to pay to update it. But you don’t <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to update it, nor is it a considerable inconvenience. You’d bloody well hope you didn’t have to pay for Zune updates, given then long list of things they have yet to implement.</p>
<p>Must we bring up the Zune vs. iTunes debate again? There are <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> things that Zune does better, but they are virtually identical in functionality and features. The best summary I found was this:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Zune also offers a more cinematic picture-heavy interface, while iTunes uses a more logical, if slightly dry, design.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh and feel free to squirt to however many of your friends that you like, but there’s no way that transferring music between Zunes is every going to be as fast, convenient or efficient as just plugging your friend’s Zune into your computer and transferring the music over.</p>

</aside>
<p>There are a lot of subscription based music services; so many that I can’t possibly begin to look them all up to compare them (especially since many, if not most, aren’t available in Australia). All I can definitively say is this; iTunes has more songs, it doesn’t force you to convert your cash to Zune points to buy songs, and you can sync your iTunes library with 5 other computers, not 3. I’m not sure about using subscription services with iTunes and Zune Media Players, but I presume that you can easily use your favourite subscription music service with your favourite music player.</p>
<p>Oh and please, stop calling the kettle black. You’re doing yourself no favours trying to point the finger at me as the biased idiot in this thread while constantly using phrases such as “I bet” and"IMO" as legitimate arguments, or without properly researching your points.</p>
<p>And no, advertising does not, in and of itself, make a product better. But as has been raised before, in order for apps to be created, you need users. In order for users to appear, you need advertising. Word-of-mouth between school kids really can’t conceivably compete against the 20 million iTouches sold as of September 2009.</p>

<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]First, I loved tap tap 2, I tried to play 3 but I din’t bother because it wanted me to make an account. Second, playing those games make my hand cramp really really badly because your hands aren’t meant to hold something that way. And because the guys at tap tap prepare them, you only get to play the songs they like. Actually, I’m pretty sure audiosurf tilt is 3d, I may be wrong, but I think it is. And if it isn’t, it looks waaaaaaaayyyy more 3d than any tap tap game. And it has wayyy more to do with rhythm (color, arches, bumps, speed, wavy tail behind the car) and also, it has the ability to customize your track by earning points by playing. That way playing actually achieves something so there’s a reason to play a lot.</p>
<p>Uhhh, no. The ZuneHD was announced in mid 2009; I got my iPod classic in late 2008. What’s more, Zunes in general aren’t marketed in Australia, let alone sold at major outlets. I didn’t even know they existed, aside from passing comments as to how bad they were, but I certainly didn’t see any sold at major retail outlets here.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]I was referring to the earlier Zune models. The people who told you they are shit were severely mistaken and probably didn’t know anything about Zunes let alone seen one. I’m sure you can get a Zune in Australia off ebay or something similar.</p>
<p>Actually, if you look at comparisons between the iTouch and the Zune (actual objective ones, you know, where they actually get some statistics and test the players), you’ll see that the audio is the same, the prices are the same, the battery lives are just about the same, the Zune is smaller (which is a BAD thing in terms of screen size), the Zune is a tad lighter (but at those weights the difference truly is negligible), and I seriously don’t understand how an accelerometer can be ‘faster’, given that its just measuring the rate at which the player accelerates.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]It has a faster response time. When viewing a picture, if you turn the device it’s almost 1 second faster on the ZuneHD than on the ipod touch. The ZuneHD’s screen is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy better in terms of color and blacks. I used a ZuneHD and an ipod touch simultaneously and Zune does preform better in terms of battery life. The Zune is close to half as light as the ipod touch. The ipod touch has two massive black areas on top and below the screen. Also, the Zune charges faster.</p>
<p>And the power button? I have no answer to your own incompetence. I’ve never found it to be a problem, and nor do any of the owners of iTouches or iPhones I know. But that’s not definitive; I just don’t know what will actually give a definitive answer on this topic, other than to say I don’t see it as a big issue.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]I don’t know what to say, it annoys me, it’s easy to press, I repeatedly press it while playing an app. BTW look above and you will find a lot of definitive answers.</p>
<p>And true, you don’t have to pay to update it. But you don’t <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to update it, nor is it a considerable inconvenience. You’d bloody well hope you didn’t have to pay for Zune updates, given then long list of things they have yet to implement.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]Not a considerable inconvenience? My aunt’s ipod wouldn’t run any of the new apps until she got the update. BTW, there has already been a free ZuneHD update.</p>
<p>Must we bring up the Zune vs. iTunes debate again? There are <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> things that Zune does better, but they are virtually identical in functionality and features. The best summary I found was this:</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]Seriously, you are not the slightest bit objective. Anyone with half a brain and half the bias you have can tell that Zune software is better. Zune software is stunningly logical. Go out and install Zune software and come back with a list of exactly what is illogical. They aren’t at all identical.<br>
Another thing, itunes runs slow on pcs.</p>
<p>Oh and feel free to squirt to however many of your friends that you like, but there’s no way that transferring music between Zunes is every going to be as fast, convenient or efficient as just plugging your friend’s Zune into your computer and transferring the music over.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]That is exactly what I meant. Ipods try to delete all your shit if you plug them into a different computer, Zunes don’t.</p>
<p>There are a lot of subscription based music services; so many that I can’t possibly begin to look them all up to compare them (especially since many, if not most, aren’t available in Australia). All I can definitively say is this; iTunes has more songs, it doesn’t force you to convert your cash to Zune points to buy songs, and you can sync your iTunes library with 5 other computers, not 3. I’m not sure about using subscription services with iTunes and Zune Media Players, but I presume that you can easily use your favourite subscription music service with your favourite music player.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]There are a lot, but Zune pass allows you to dl them directly from your Zune, works with Zune software, allows you to choose 10 songs to keep permanently each month, and is extremely simple and easy. And I wouldn’t be surprised to find Zune pass is cheaper than other music subscriptions.</p>
<p>Oh and please, stop calling the kettle black. You’re doing yourself no favours trying to point the finger at me as the biased idiot in this thread while constantly using phrases such as “I bet” and"IMO" as legitimate arguments, or without properly researching your points.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]That’s a good thing, would you rather I state my opinions as facts?</p>
<p>And no, advertising does not, in and of itself, make a product better. But as has been raised before, in order for apps to be created, you need users. In order for users to appear, you need advertising. Word-of-mouth between school kids really can’t conceivably compete against the 20 million iTouches sold as of September 2009.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]True, but apps aren’t the huge selling point of the ZuneHD (thought they do have some very nice ones). Also, I’m sure we will see many more apps for the Zune.</p>

<p>Words about Audiosurf.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Look, I’ve played Audiosurf, and I’ll admit that it was fun for a while, but it got old. It was more like a colourful and interactive way to listen to your music rather than an actual ‘game’. And, as I understand it, the Zune one is just a cut down version of that. I’m not saying its a bad game, I’m just saying that it can in no way compete against the massive games library for the iTouch.</p>
<p>I had a quick look at a video of Audiosurf Tilt, and you’re right; it is 3D. But the use of 3D =/= fun, so its not fair to say that Zune games are better or more fun than iTouch games based purely on their use of 3D.</p>
<p>And just on TapTap; if your hand hurts while playing it, you’re plainly doing it wrong.</p>

<p>It has a faster response time. When viewing a picture, if you turn the device it’s almost 1 second faster on the ZuneHD than on the ipod touch. The ZuneHD’s screen is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy better in terms of color and blacks. I used a ZuneHD and an ipod touch simultaneously and Zune does preform better in terms of battery life. The Zune is close to half as light as the ipod touch. The ipod touch has two massive black areas on top and below the screen. Also, the Zune charges faster.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Okay, few things. Yes, the screen is more advanced, but I personally find the iTouch screen more than adequate for everything from watching movies, browsing through songs or reading e-books.</p>
<p>If you read the <span class="bbcode-i">actual</span> specifications for the iTouch and Zune (and not perform absurdly subjective tests yourself), you’ll see that they’re just about the same, with the Zune ahead by an hour or two (Wikipedia is your friend here). The Zune may be 'close to half as light as the iTouch, but when you’re talking about weights as insubstantial as those media players, is it even relevant? I certainly wouldn’t factor it in at all. But I suppose you have to give it to the Zune.</p>
<p>And on charging times, the Zune can charge in 3 hours, and the iTouch can charge in about the same time, but I have yet to see an official answer on its charging time.</p>

<p>Oh please, learn to use iTunes. You press the BIG NO BUTTON when it asks you if you want to automatically sync your iPod, and then press the MANUALLY MANAGE MUSIC button on the iTouch options section in iTunes.</p>

</aside>
<p>You can’t say “oh the Zune is better than the iTouch” and then say “oh but they aren’t competing on Apps”. At the moment, the Apps library for the iTouch far outweighs that of the Zune, and as I’ve explained before, I highly doubt that you will see the same kind of App coverage on the Zune as on the iTouch. But regardless, we’re not dealing in terms of the future, we’re dealing in terms of the now. And right now, there are far far more apps on the iTouch than on the Zune.</p>
