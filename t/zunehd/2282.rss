    <description>Discuss.

My brother bought one and I am using it right now.
It doesn&#39;t have very many apps but audiosurf tilt is far better than any iPod app I have seen. It has a higher resolution screen. its accelerometer is faster. It is smaller and better looking and has more intuitive interface. Ms is planning on adding flash support. Comes in several different colors. Cool minor things like quickplay and a screensaver like thing when in now playing.

Cons:
No external speakers, less apps, can&#39;t watch online videos yet. Doesn&#39;t come in a 64 gigabyte version. Smaller screen. Doesn&#39;t work as well online as itouch.</description>

<p>Hey, same here, I was just taking his phrasing and putting the lowest amount of seconds in there. Maybe I should have said 0 seconds, but it’s slightly more, obviously.</p>
<p>Tbh, everyone should use foobar2000 in stead of all that iTunes and Zune crap.</p>

<p>Are you retarded? Seriously. If you had spent more than 5 fucking minutes trying to actually use the software instead of judging it by “LOL APPLE MADE SOMETHING SIMILAR” You would have noticed…Zune indeed imports AAC Files.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hey Elpants, how about you take that stick out of your ass? I’m <span class="bbcode-i">trying</span> here, and calling me a dick for doing so isn’t actually helping. I was talking about importing from CDs. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f4086c3679e9de8eeb89059690e5127459ca9b40.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="yOOxZSdPo31FQoMZGuQTxD3Wtva" width="160" height="120"></p>
<p>Where exactly is the option to import in AAC? And can you convert files to AAC? Or do you have to convert them in another program? I’d be interested to know if there was one, to compare conversion/import times.</p>
<p>My point wasn’t so much advocating for AAC, but just making a point about diversity of formats; people like to have a choice, since there are a lot of advantages in the different formats, so limiting someone to WMA and MP3 seems very…limiting.</p>

<p>Something I keep forgetting to mention; I installed itunes on my computer and not only did it force me to install quicktime which I have absolutely no interest in, when I told it to automatically import songs for me it started importing .wav files from Half-Life 1 and 2, so I canceled it and uninstalled it. On my mom’s mac everytime she buys a video from itunes store it automatically downloads the standard and HD version of it and she cancels the HD version but then it comes back. I’m sure there’s a way to fix this, but it’s not stunningly obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, it makes you install Quicktime. No idea why it does that; probably something to do with watching videos. Meh; doesn’t affect my computer in any way.</p>
<p>I don’t know why your iTunes started importing songs from your Steam folder…I always just get it to sort through my ‘My Music’ folder. And when I got Mad Men Season 3 Episode 1 for free off iTunes (Christmas giveaway, yay!), it only downloaded the single (SD?) version, so I have no idea what’s going on there. Maybe some strange US store malarkey.</p>

<p>In fact, I just pulled out my copy of Rush’s Moving Pictures*, opened iTunes and ripped the CD to my music library (Encoded in AAC)… I started up the Zune software…and guess what was importing to the library? The Rush album I was ripping in AAC.<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Sorry for such a large picture, dual 22" and 23" monitor set-up.</p>
<p>*I chose the Rush album because it’s the only one I never ripped.</p>
<p>Now excuse me while I convert those files to a worthwhile format.</p>

<p>I also noticed a few things when I went digging around in the more technical aspects of the Zune player. Importing songs was the thing that got me; in iTunes you can import in MP3, AAC, AIFF, Apple Lossless and Wave straight out of the box, and even convert any music to any of those formats very easily. In Zune you’re limited to MP3 or WMA (which means you’re basically limited to MP3), and you can’t convert between formats.</p>

            <p>So I went poking around the Zune Media Player today…</p>
<p>First things first, I ran a speed test. Cold start up to playing music for Zune was exactly the same time (roughly 7 seconds) as for iTunes. Zune started up faster but took a second to load the funky music playing screen.</p>
<p>A few comments on cosmetics: The Zune player looks <span class="bbcode-i">much</span> nicer than iTunes does. The nice coverart background in the player screen is superb, compared to the, well, nothing in iTunes. But functionality wise, its pretty much exactly the same. The Quickplay screen just shows the equivalent of your ‘My Top Rated’, ‘Recently Added’ and ‘Recently Played’ playlists in iTunes. Nothing new here.</p>
<p>As much as people rave about its snazzy looks, if you look at the ‘collection’ screen, its like you’ve jumped straight back into iTunes. You can sort the lists by Artist, Genre, Album and Song Title, exactly the same way you can in iTunes. Except that in iTunes you can also sort by a whole range of other criterion, such as Year, Date Added and even Bit Rate.</p>
<p>I also noticed a few things when I went digging around in the more technical aspects of the Zune player. Importing songs was the thing that got me; in iTunes you can import in MP3, AAC, AIFF, Apple Lossless and Wave straight out of the box, and even convert any music to any of those formats very easily. In Zune you’re limited to MP3 or WMA (which means you’re basically limited to MP3), and you can’t convert between formats.</p>
<p>I can’t speak to how Zune manages its library, since I was always happy for iTunes to do it itself and don’t want to screw anything up, but I’ve heard that that’s better for those that want that kind of functionality.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s just my observations for now. Will post back when I have more.</p>

<p>There are a lot of subscription based music services; so many that I can’t possibly begin to look them all up to compare them (especially since many, if not most, aren’t available in Australia). All I can definitively say is this; iTunes has more songs, it doesn’t force you to convert your cash to Zune points to buy songs, and you can sync your iTunes library with 5 other computers, not 3. I’m not sure about using subscription services with iTunes and Zune Media Players, but I presume that you can easily use your favourite subscription music service with your favourite music player.</p>

<p>Words about Audiosurf.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Look, I’ve played Audiosurf, and I’ll admit that it was fun for a while, but it got old. It was more like a colourful and interactive way to listen to your music rather than an actual ‘game’. And, as I understand it, the Zune one is just a cut down version of that. I’m not saying its a bad game, I’m just saying that it can in no way compete against the massive games library for the iTouch.</p>
<p>I had a quick look at a video of Audiosurf Tilt, and you’re right; it is 3D. But the use of 3D =/= fun, so its not fair to say that Zune games are better or more fun than iTouch games based purely on their use of 3D.</p>
<p>And just on TapTap; if your hand hurts while playing it, you’re plainly doing it wrong.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="garthbartin">

<p>It has a faster response time. When viewing a picture, if you turn the device it’s almost 1 second faster on the ZuneHD than on the ipod touch. The ZuneHD’s screen is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy better in terms of color and blacks. I used a ZuneHD and an ipod touch simultaneously and Zune does preform better in terms of battery life. The Zune is close to half as light as the ipod touch. The ipod touch has two massive black areas on top and below the screen. Also, the Zune charges faster.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Okay, few things. Yes, the screen is more advanced, but I personally find the iTouch screen more than adequate for everything from watching movies, browsing through songs or reading e-books.</p>
<p>If you read the <span class="bbcode-i">actual</span> specifications for the iTouch and Zune (and not perform absurdly subjective tests yourself), you’ll see that they’re just about the same, with the Zune ahead by an hour or two (Wikipedia is your friend here). The Zune may be 'close to half as light as the iTouch, but when you’re talking about weights as insubstantial as those media players, is it even relevant? I certainly wouldn’t factor it in at all. But I suppose you have to give it to the Zune.</p>
<p>And on charging times, the Zune can charge in 3 hours, and the iTouch can charge in about the same time, but I have yet to see an official answer on its charging time.</p>

<p>You can’t say “oh the Zune is better than the iTouch” and then say “oh but they aren’t competing on Apps”. At the moment, the Apps library for the iTouch far outweighs that of the Zune, and as I’ve explained before, I highly doubt that you will see the same kind of App coverage on the Zune as on the iTouch. But regardless, we’re not dealing in terms of the future, we’re dealing in terms of the now. And right now, there are far far more apps on the iTouch than on the Zune.</p>

<p>So basically your point is that there isn’t an Audiosurf Tilt game on iTouch. True. There is, however, TapTap Revenge, which is free. Its basically like Guitar Hero for iTouch, and is based on the same very basic principle as Audiosurf; music rhythm. And guess what? Because the guys over at TapTap pre-prepare all of the tracks you play in-game, they’re always going to be more accurate to the music and more fun to play than games that generate rhythm patterns on the fly.</p>
<p>Your point about no 3D games on the iTouch is just completely fallacy, given that Audiosurf itself isn’t really a 3D game; it just makes the background look further away from the foreground - something that TapTap does equally well, and something that arcade games have been doing since the 80s.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]First, I loved tap tap 2, I tried to play 3 but I din’t bother because it wanted me to make an account. Second, playing those games make my hand cramp really really badly because your hands aren’t meant to hold something that way. And because the guys at tap tap prepare them, you only get to play the songs they like. Actually, I’m pretty sure audiosurf tilt is 3d, I may be wrong, but I think it is. And if it isn’t, it looks waaaaaaaayyyy more 3d than any tap tap game. And it has wayyy more to do with rhythm (color, arches, bumps, speed, wavy tail behind the car) and also, it has the ability to customize your track by earning points by playing. That way playing actually achieves something so there’s a reason to play a lot.</p>
<p>Uhhh, no. The ZuneHD was announced in mid 2009; I got my iPod classic in late 2008. What’s more, Zunes in general aren’t marketed in Australia, let alone sold at major outlets. I didn’t even know they existed, aside from passing comments as to how bad they were, but I certainly didn’t see any sold at major retail outlets here.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]I was referring to the earlier Zune models. The people who told you they are shit were severely mistaken and probably didn’t know anything about Zunes let alone seen one. I’m sure you can get a Zune in Australia off ebay or something similar.</p>
<p>Actually, if you look at comparisons between the iTouch and the Zune (actual objective ones, you know, where they actually get some statistics and test the players), you’ll see that the audio is the same, the prices are the same, the battery lives are just about the same, the Zune is smaller (which is a BAD thing in terms of screen size), the Zune is a tad lighter (but at those weights the difference truly is negligible), and I seriously don’t understand how an accelerometer can be ‘faster’, given that its just measuring the rate at which the player accelerates.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]It has a faster response time. When viewing a picture, if you turn the device it’s almost 1 second faster on the ZuneHD than on the ipod touch. The ZuneHD’s screen is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy better in terms of color and blacks. I used a ZuneHD and an ipod touch simultaneously and Zune does preform better in terms of battery life. The Zune is close to half as light as the ipod touch. The ipod touch has two massive black areas on top and below the screen. Also, the Zune charges faster.</p>
<p>And the power button? I have no answer to your own incompetence. I’ve never found it to be a problem, and nor do any of the owners of iTouches or iPhones I know. But that’s not definitive; I just don’t know what will actually give a definitive answer on this topic, other than to say I don’t see it as a big issue.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]I don’t know what to say, it annoys me, it’s easy to press, I repeatedly press it while playing an app. BTW look above and you will find a lot of definitive answers.</p>
<p>And true, you don’t have to pay to update it. But you don’t <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to update it, nor is it a considerable inconvenience. You’d bloody well hope you didn’t have to pay for Zune updates, given then long list of things they have yet to implement.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]Not a considerable inconvenience? My aunt’s ipod wouldn’t run any of the new apps until she got the update. BTW, there has already been a free ZuneHD update.</p>
<p>Must we bring up the Zune vs. iTunes debate again? There are <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> things that Zune does better, but they are virtually identical in functionality and features. The best summary I found was this:</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]Seriously, you are not the slightest bit objective. Anyone with half a brain and half the bias you have can tell that Zune software is better. Zune software is stunningly logical. Go out and install Zune software and come back with a list of exactly what is illogical. They aren’t at all identical.<br>
Another thing, itunes runs slow on pcs.</p>
<p>Oh and feel free to squirt to however many of your friends that you like, but there’s no way that transferring music between Zunes is every going to be as fast, convenient or efficient as just plugging your friend’s Zune into your computer and transferring the music over.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]That is exactly what I meant. Ipods try to delete all your shit if you plug them into a different computer, Zunes don’t.</p>
<p>There are a lot of subscription based music services; so many that I can’t possibly begin to look them all up to compare them (especially since many, if not most, aren’t available in Australia). All I can definitively say is this; iTunes has more songs, it doesn’t force you to convert your cash to Zune points to buy songs, and you can sync your iTunes library with 5 other computers, not 3. I’m not sure about using subscription services with iTunes and Zune Media Players, but I presume that you can easily use your favourite subscription music service with your favourite music player.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]There are a lot, but Zune pass allows you to dl them directly from your Zune, works with Zune software, allows you to choose 10 songs to keep permanently each month, and is extremely simple and easy. And I wouldn’t be surprised to find Zune pass is cheaper than other music subscriptions.</p>
<p>Oh and please, stop calling the kettle black. You’re doing yourself no favours trying to point the finger at me as the biased idiot in this thread while constantly using phrases such as “I bet” and"IMO" as legitimate arguments, or without properly researching your points.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]That’s a good thing, would you rather I state my opinions as facts?</p>
<p>And no, advertising does not, in and of itself, make a product better. But as has been raised before, in order for apps to be created, you need users. In order for users to appear, you need advertising. Word-of-mouth between school kids really can’t conceivably compete against the 20 million iTouches sold as of September 2009.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]True, but apps aren’t the huge selling point of the ZuneHD (thought they do have some very nice ones). Also, I’m sure we will see many more apps for the Zune.</p>

Because the guys over at TapTap pre-prepare all of the tracks you play in-game, they’re always going to be more accurate to the music and more fun to play than games that generate rhythm patterns on the fly.</p>
<p>Your point about no 3D games on the iTouch is just completely fallacy, given that Audiosurf itself isn’t really a 3D game; it just makes the background look further away from the foreground - something that TapTap does equally well, and something that arcade games have been doing since the 80s.</p>

<p>Uhhh, no. The ZuneHD was announced in mid 2009; I got my iPod classic in late 2008. What’s more, Zunes in general aren’t marketed in Australia, let alone sold at major outlets. I didn’t even know they existed, aside from passing comments as to how bad they were, but I certainly didn’t see any sold at major retail outlets here.</p>
<p>From the Wikipedia article:</p>

<p>In late fall of 2009 Zune Marketplace replaced Xbox Live Video Marketplace offering streaming and downloading of movies and TV shows. This may also lead to international distribution of the Zune Marketplace on Xbox Live in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, France, Australia, Italy, Spain, and Germany. At the moment Zune HD is only sold in the US and Puerto Rico. There are currently no known plans to bring it to other countries.</p>

<p>Actually, if you look at comparisons between the iTouch and the Zune (actual objective ones, you know, where they actually get some statistics and test the players), you’ll see that the audio is the same, the prices are the same, the battery lives are just about the same, the Zune is smaller (which is a BAD thing in terms of screen size), the Zune is a tad lighter (but at those weights the difference truly is negligible), and I seriously don’t understand how an accelerometer can be ‘faster’, given that its just measuring the rate at which the player accelerates.</p>
<p>And the power button? I have no answer to your own incompetence. I’ve never found it to be a problem, and nor do any of the owners of iTouches or iPhones I know. But that’s not definitive; I just don’t know what will actually give a definitive answer on this topic, other than to say I don’t see it as a big issue.</p>
<p>And true, you don’t have to pay to update it. But you don’t <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to update it, nor is it a considerable inconvenience. You’d bloody well hope you didn’t have to pay for Zune updates, given then long list of things they have yet to implement.</p>
<p>Must we bring up the Zune vs. iTunes debate again? There are <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> things that Zune does better, but they are virtually identical in functionality and features. The best summary I found was this:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Zune also offers a more cinematic picture-heavy interface, while iTunes uses a more logical, if slightly dry, design.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh and feel free to squirt to however many of your friends that you like, but there’s no way that transferring music between Zunes is every going to be as fast, convenient or efficient as just plugging your friend’s Zune into your computer and transferring the music over.</p>

<p>There are a lot of subscription based music services; so many that I can’t possibly begin to look them all up to compare them (especially since many, if not most, aren’t available in Australia). All I can definitively say is this; iTunes has more songs, it doesn’t force you to convert your cash to Zune points to buy songs, and you can sync your iTunes library with 5 other computers, not 3. I’m not sure about using subscription services with iTunes and Zune Media Players, but I presume that you can easily use your favourite subscription music service with your favourite music player.</p>
<p>Oh and please, stop calling the kettle black. You’re doing yourself no favours trying to point the finger at me as the biased idiot in this thread while constantly using phrases such as “I bet” and"IMO" as legitimate arguments, or without properly researching your points.</p>
<p>And no, advertising does not, in and of itself, make a product better. But as has been raised before, in order for apps to be created, you need users. In order for users to appear, you need advertising. Word-of-mouth between school kids really can’t conceivably compete against the 20 million iTouches sold as of September 2009.</p>
