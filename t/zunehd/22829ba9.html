My brother bought one and I am using it right now. 
It doesn’t have very many apps but audiosurf tilt is far better than any iPod app I have seen. It has a higher resolution screen. its accelerometer is faster.&amp;hellip;">

<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s iPhoto isn’t there to edit photos, it’s there to organize photos, and it does that well. You also seem to have inherited your mum’s inability to figure things out on a computer. Adding photos to iPhoto can be done through various ways, but the most obvious ones being “File -&gt; Import”, Drag’n’Drop and copy-paste. If you find those actions to be illogical… Well then I just don’t think you’re all that clever.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]I was talking about exporting photos and finding the actual .jpg file of an iphoto photo.</p>
<p>Apart from that: you’re right, there’s less choice for all sorts of applications, but there’s still choice, instead of having to skim through a list of 20 apps to do something, I have to skim through a list of 3-4, but hey, there’s still options to perform that task.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Not a misinterpretation, but You in no way have to have trouble picking through apps, you just pick the first one on the list when you google it or if it’s really that important you look at customer reviews.</p>
<p>And for the Window Blinds thing (which I find a very silly example by the way), there’s <a href="https://www.geekspiff.com/software/themepark/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> for Mac OS X. And while it may not have a community as big as Window Blinds’ (which is very obvious btw, considering how much more Windows-users there are), there’s still a community and you can still share themes.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]So you admit that it is inferior at least in this case?</p>
<p>So yes, for everything on PC, there’s at the very least one on Mac as well.</p>
<p>Back to the hardware now. Neither loony636 nor me have claimed at any point that Apple computers have a bigger community/fanbase than PCs. We did, however, say that the Apple devices like the iPods and iPhone have a bigger community and fanbase.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]I am pretty sure I already replied to this one.</p>
<p>I posted links to online stores in an earlier post that sell parts for all kinds of Macs (from laptops to desktops). Yes, I realize there isn’t a store that sells them on every corner of every city and/or village, but they’re still around. Even for me, living in this small country nobody ever heard of, there’s 2 retail stores that sell those parts for Macs (and no, not counting the official retailers/Apple Store (there isn’t even an actual Apple Store over here).</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]I to live in a small country almost nobody has ever heard of (America) and there isn’t a single store selling mac appliances anywhere near me. But there is a pc store almost one block from my house and I can easily repair in problems with my pc myself or one of my friends can do it.</p>
<p>But anyway, you (again) gave an example that is in no way a fair representation of the reality. <span class="bbcode-i">“I’ll drive 2 hours (this part might still be correct) to get some loser (what makes a tech guy a loser?) to look at it and then loose my adapter (wait what?)”</span>… This might just be an experience you had (and obviously it’s a shitty experience), but again, that does -not- make Apple products bad. And if you don’t want to accept this, then I’ll just lower msyelf to your level of discussion and say the following: <span class="bbcode-i">“A friend of mine’s Macbook fell on the ground and the screen was cracked, he sent it back to Apple’s closest shipping center (Ireland) by mailorder, and he got it back all fixed up 5-6 days later. For free. While I used to have a PC that kept freezing up and brought it in for a checkup and that retarded dickwad kept the machine for 2 weeks and returned it all formatted and stuff and it still froze up after that!”</span>… How’s that for a (true) story? But hey, at least I’m not the one calling one or the other shit, I’m the one being reasonable here… Hardly anything close to being a fanboy.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Muffin is more the fanboy than you. The point of my personalized experience is that it is extremely difficult for me, and most likely many other people to repair a broken mac while I only have to walk a block to repair a pc.</p>
<p>And to touch your final point. When someone says “that device has a bigger community”, he/she doesn’t mean: “you can check facebook and myspace on it”… That person means: “There’s millions of apps around (both for free and for a fee) and hundreds being added daily. There’s official apps and unofficial apps.”…</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]Already replied to this one, the statement you were replying to was directed at muffin</p>
<p>You can actually boil it down to the following: iPod is to the Zune as Pc is to the Mac. PC is dominating the market of personal computing at the moment. iPod is dominating the market of portable mediaplayers at the moment. Can any of that change in the future? Yes of course. By if you ask me (and this is my personal opinion), it won’t be the ZuneHD taking over the position of marketleader, mainly because the original Zune exploded in Microsoft’s face and built a bad rep for itself that way. People will buy it, but it’ll never be as big as the iPod. Just like how Macs will never be as widespread as PCs.</p>

          <p>Drag the photo’s from iPhoto to your desktop or anywhere you want on the HD. File -&gt; Export. User/Pictures/iPhoto Library -&gt; Show package content (I’ll give you this one, it’s a bit silly, but the former ones are pretty obvious).</p>
<p>While Windows loves to make you click-click-click and let you nose around on the HD, OS X loves to let you drag’n’drop pretty much everything so you don’t have to dive into the HD (and possibly get lost), less clicking, faster workflow. Yes, it requires a user that’s been using Windows for the longest time to get used to it, but it really isn’t that big of a deal once you’ve taken the first step.</p>
<p>I’ll explain to you why I stepped over to a Mac. I’m not a tech-head. I hate tinkering with hardware (risking breaking it even more). I hate installing required software or drivers to keep everything riskfree. I hate pondering whether to pick videocard A or videocard B… Or maybe C? Oh wait, there’s a D, E, F, G, H, I and J as well? Bugger! I also hate trying to find an application I need from an endless list of apps. So having less choice and just picking the first one that pops up is a blessing for me.</p>
<p>The iMac I have now… Does it work? Yes. Have I had any issues with it? A minor one, got fixed pretty fast as well (Firmware issue). Can I use my applications on it? Yes I can (I’m an animator, cartoonist and digital designer). Can I play the games I like on it? Yes I can. Is it a powerhouse that puts everyone else to shame and can it run the latest games n highest visual settings? Nope not really, but that’s not what I want from a computer. I want it to work and offer me ways of having fun, and while PCs work as well, Windows doesn’t… At least not for me. Out of 13 years of experience with both Macs and Windows, the workflow on OS X just can’t be compared to Windows.</p>
<p>If OS X ran flawlessly on a normal PC, I’d most likely get a PC next time around. Because Macs are just a different kind of PC. They have the same technology (looking at the Mac Pro here), they have the same compatibility and can be upgraded just as easy (just takes more effort to find the parts for it because it’s not as widespread as PC). The major difference is the OS, and in terms of workflow (13 years of experience with both Mac OS (9-X) and Windows (95-98-2000-XP-Vista) talking here), OS X blows Windows straight out of the water. And for that alone, I’m willing to pay the Apple-tax.</p>
<p>Too bad OS X will never run on PCs flawlessly, because if it did, it would lose a great portion of the worry-free aspect (and bother with drivers and other software again).</p>

          <p>Oh boy, I walked into a bit of a war here…</p>
<p>I don’t have much to say about Mac’s, except that I don’t use one, so I’m not really in a position to argue about them. I have used a Mac, and I’m just fine with my PC at the moment.</p>
<p>But, back on topic, I just got a ZuneHD for Christmas here, and I love it. I have used a Touch and enough of it’s features to compare them I think… I’m just going to tell what each can do, and what each can’t. Call it like I see it.</p>
<p>1)Actual Device - The ZuneHD is slightly smaller than an iPod Touch. A Touch has a fairly simple shape, rounded, polished silver back. The front is black. A little thicker than the Zune. It has one button on top for power/lock, a button on the side for volume, and a button on the front for the ‘home’ button.</p>
<p>The Zune’s shape is a little more defined. The front is flat, with a long skinny ‘home’ button near the bottom. The bottom section of the device is finished in a matte [black in my case] color of your choice, and the back is a brushed metal casing, again in your choice of color. And separating the front and back halves is a silver stripe on either side of the device. The back has beveled edges, and visible screws at each corner. There is a button on the side set into the silver stripe which brings up play controls, and a button on top for power / lock.</p>
<p>Both have accelerometers. The Zune has an HD Radio. The iPod has a microphone and external speaker. The iPod has an Intel mobile processor and the Zune has a powerful Nvidia Tegra processor.</p>
<p>My take: The back of the iPod Touch, due to the nature of polished things, tends to get a lot of fingerprint marks on it unless you by a case for your iPod. The Zune, in contrast, is a brushed steel [black in my case] back and fingerprint marks are minimal on the silver model, and non-existant on the black model.</p>
<p>The accelerometer on both seems solid, but the Zune’s seems to respond a little quicker than the iPod Touch’s. Otherwise, the same. And finally, weight. The iPod feels like a solid, and fairly heavy device. When weighed in the other hand, the Zune feels ridiculously light. Although the device is smaller than the touch, it is a LOT lighter, and considering that they both have about the same hardware, this is impressive.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Screens - The Touch’s screen is bigger, although not by much. I believe the Touch is a 3.5 inch screen, and the ZuneHD has a 3.3 inch screen. As for quality, I do have to give it to the Zune’s OLED screen. It’s vibrant, the blacks are amazing, and it just looks sharper than a Touch’s screen. I have held them side by side, and I can say for sure that the ZuneHD’s is much better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interface - The iPod’s interface is simple. There is a home screen with several pages of icons for the iPod’s various functions. All apps, games, and organizer functions are located here. My memory is a bit foggy, and I can’t remember whether or not the music and settings icons are set off by themselves. To return to the screen, the user simply pushes the ‘home’ button. The menus are snappy, stuff loads pretty quick, scrolling is done by dragging your finger up and down, and it’s smooth. When you release, the scrolling keeps going a bit and slows to a stop. To lock the iPod, you press the power button on top. To unlock, you press the home or power button and the wallpaper appears, where you have to slide a small square across the screen to unlock the iPod.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Zune’s interface is a little more traditional. The home screen consists of two ‘halves’. On the foreground on the right, there is a list of items: Music, Videos, Pictures, Marketplace, Podcasts, Internet, Radio, Social, Apps, and Settings. On the left, there are icons for Now Playing if you have music playing, recent songs, artists, and apps, and any newly added songs, artists, and apps. And section for ‘Pinned’ items, which are like favorites. Anything can be added here, apps, radio station, pictures, albums, artists, songs, websites. A tap brings this half of the menu to the foreground, and the list on the right falls to the back. The music menu is divided into artists, albums, etc. just like a Touch. One thing I’d like to add, is that when at the home screen on the Zune, if you tilt the device, everything sort of wobbles around, giving the impression that everything is floating. It’s kind of neat. When the device is playing a song, a screensaver will appear after 20 seconds. Now, this is different every time, but it displays the artist and song and album, album cover, time remaining, etc. in a fancy way. In the background of the Now Playing screen and screensaver is a picture of the artist. The interface is smooth and snappy, and utilizes the accelerometer for added eye candy effects, as explained before. No lag. Black background with white writing. Locking is done in the same manner as the iPod, except that the lock screen makes you slide your background picture upwards, revealing whatever you had going underneath.</p>
<p>This was what Garthbartin was arguing about before. On an iPod, all of the apps and things are located on a central screen, and if you have a lot of apps, finding a particular one could be a LITTLE more difficult than on the Zune, which has it’s functions categorized on the main screen menus. That’s all he was trying to say.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Apps - The iPod has a lot of apps. A LOT. There’s no denying this fact. Some are free, some you have to pay for. There is an app for almost anything. The most recent iPods have some 3D games on them, but I haven’t played them, so I can’t say much about them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Zune does not have many apps at this time. There are about 15 available on the Zune Marketplace, stuff like Twitter and a Calculator. Most are games. Audiosurf Tilt is extremely fun, and better graphics than any iPod game i’ve seen on the commercials. It is possible, using XNA game studio, to add user made-apps to the Zune. At this time, all apps for the ZuneHD are free. Facebook is a planned app, Twitter has already been released.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Internet - Both connect to the internet via a wifi connection. Both are solid. The iPod uses Safari, which is a very good mobile internet experience. The Zune uses a very modified version of Internet Explorer, not related to the one in Windows Mobile. Currently, there is no flash support for either, although the iPod can watch Youtube videos with the Youtube app. Flash support is planned and in development for the Zune.</li>
</ol>
<p>6)Device Specific - The iPod Touch has a built in microphone, and an external speaker, which is nice. Also, the external volume buttons are a plus as well, since the Zune doesn’t have those. The button on the side brings up the play controls on the screen (Play, pause, next, previous, volume up and down), which I haven’t found to be a problem yet, it’s just different. It’s nice that you can control your music from anywhere in the interface that way tho.</p>
<p>The Zune has a built in HD radio, which I don’t use much since I’m in a rural community, but it’s free, so when I go the city I can use it. The Zune has a wireless sync capability, meaning you can sync music to the device over a wireless network without the need to plug a cable into your computer, which is also a really nice feature. And finally, the HD part of the ZuneHD. The device has the ability to play 720p high definition movies rented on the Zune Marketplace (Same as on the Xbox 360). The device itself can’t display the movies in high-def on it’s own screen, the movies are downscaled. But if you buy the dock (which is a little stupid, it should have come with it) you can hook it up via HDMI to your HD tv, and watch it in it’s full 720p glory. The dock includes a wireless remote, so it could become part of your home entertainment system.</p>
<p>And I think that’s about it. Obviously, I can provide more information about the Zune since I have one, but I’ve tried to write this all as neutral as I could, even though I am a little bit biased towards the ZuneHD. These are just the features of each as I have observed them. Let me know if I missed anything (and I’m sure you will :p)</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, forgot to mention about the software. The Zune software is awesome, and easy to use, you just drag and drop to copy stuff to your Zune. As well, it automatically downloads all of your album info for your songs, and I’m not sure if the Software or the Zune does it, but for all of my artists on my Zune there is a bio, pictures, and discography and related artists. I didn’t do any of that, it was all done automatically. As well, the automatic Podcasts are nice.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Sorry for the wall of text, I got a little carried away</p>

          <p>Just discovered that ipod touches only sync with one computer at a time; if you want to sync with a new computer, you must forget the old one and erase all content from your ipod. I’m sure there are work arounds, but this is just ridiculous. My friend gave me his ipod touch so I could put a bunch of movies on it, and it wouldn’t let me sync on my computer without deleting all the content.</p>
<p>I recently bought a ZuneHD black 16 gig and have a custom skin coming in the mail. I’ll show you guys when the skin gets here. I love it. It’s amazing. I’m paying for Zune pass and I am sharing it with my bro and will also share it with my friend when she gets a ZuneHD for her birthday. For 15 dollars a month you get unlimited music for 3 Zunes and 3 Computers. And songs and apps can be downloaded directly from the Zune from marketplace. You can also stream songs if you don’t want to dl them. About 80% of the videos and songs were given to me by my brother or by my friends.</p>
<p>Since my brother got his ZuneHD and started showing it to people, we’ve been able to get one person to buy one (two including my friend who’s getting one on her birthday) and have gotten 2 more people to seriously consider getting one, one of which is an “ipodfag”. There are also 3 more people who bought a ZuneHD without our encouragement. I’m sure many more would buy one if they had the money.</p>
<p>Also, could a mod please rename this thread to “ipod touch versus ZuneHD” and put it in the massdebating section?</p>

          <p>I’ve had a ZuneHD for about a month now after having nothing but iPod since the very first generation of them.</p>
<p>Things I like,<br>
-Interface, arguably better, but I like it A LOT more. Using iPod interfaces seems pretty mechanical (but it works), ZuneHD interface flows extremely well. I had some trouble figuring it out at first, but that is just because I was used to an iPod, now it’s vice versa.</p>
<p>-Size, thing is small, but it’s not so small you forget you have it.</p>
<p>-Screen is fucking brilliant looking. There is no other commercially available electronic with a better screen.</p>
<p>-Rugged, at first I was scared of even putting it in my pocket thinking that brilliant screen would get scratched. I’m sure it can get scratched, but while I have treated it with care, there have been moments I thought there was no way it wasn’t scratched. It still looks brand new.</p>
<p>-Sound quality, when listening to music there are more factors to the bit rate when it comes to how good the music sounds. I already have myself some mid-range $60 Sony Earbuds that sound fantastic so I wanted to test the actual hardware, I did some sound testing on both my iPod and Zune after I got it. Zune definitely delivers.</p>
<p>-What apps? Some complain apps are everything. But I have over 160gb of music, filling all 32gb of the Zune’s storage was no problem, I couldn’t put an app on it if I wanted. Besides I use it as an MP3 player not a gimped computer.</p>
<p>-Web browser is surprisingly awesome, pages load fast, pages load full sized, and pages render properly. Pinch gestures are extremely responsive.</p>
<p>-Wireless syncing, no USB cable? No problem!</p>
<p>Things I don’t like</p>
<p>-The Zune software could use a few bug fixes.</p>
<p>-Would be nice to be able to enable disk use. When you plug it in, only thing that will recognize it is the Zune Software. There are some easy hacks that enable this, but it being an officially supported feature would be grand.</p>

<p>I’ve been casually shopping for some screen protectors, is it just one of those static stick like ones? Pre-cut for the Zune?</p>
<p>I had Audiosurf on it, yeah it’s fun, but I removed it to fit more music.</p>
<p>I think the only app I would sacrifice music for is the Facebook one whenever it comes out.</p>

<p>ZuneHD and ipod touch just come down to whether or not you value apps and fanbase over qaulity. I personally am going to go with quality.</p>
<p>A) I’ve heard that macs running windows have a tendancy to overheat<br>
B) Macs running windows are basically pcs with over priced hardware<br>
C) On the pc you have a massive range of choices in programs for every single task and many are free while on a mac there’s only one or two and sometimes none<br>
D) On a pc you can choose from many many different competing companies’ hardware so you get the best hardware for the lowest price<br>
E) Most mac accessories have to be bought from apple so you are at Steve Job’s mercy<br>
F) I am unfamiliar with apple’s pr, but I would like to point out that when my brother’s Zune broke he sent it in and got an entirely new one (not refurbished) sent back to him for free even with an extra set of headphones and a sync cable also, when my mom went to get her mac fixed she ended up with some assholes who lost her charger and gave her some shitty one they had laying around (this was actually from a third-party group, not apple but it was the only mac repair shop she could find within 100 miles)<br>
G) Most modern pc cases are extremely easy to open so if you want to upgrade your hardware it takes only a few minutes<br>
H) Most macs are all-in-ones so if you break your screen then you have to send in your entire computer<br>
I) If you custom build your pc you have a wide range of choices in hardware and cases<br>
J) Touche, yes my mom does suck at computers but she’s had more trouble with her mac than she ever had when she used to use my dad’s pc</p>
<p>I could go on but I am sick of typing.</p>

<p>All laptops overheat when running windows. PC and Macs. Actually my friend had an Asus laptop and he would have to put it in the freezer every hour or so to cool it off (he had massive fans on it btw) while my MacBook Pro never had any problems</p>

<p>I have both a Mac laptop and a custom built PC. I love them both. But what I don’t like is Windows. 7 Finally started making things more easy but only because they started to borrow from the Mac OS. The Mac OS it the easiest to navigate and use OS I’ve ever used. If Windows would use OSX’s filing system PCs would finally be close to perfect.</p>
<p>Oh and stop saying the same damn thing over and over. Audiosurf, Audiosurf, Audiosurf! OMG that is the only game you have mentioned. iPod Touch has many more better games… GTA Chinatown Wars, MiniGore and tons more but I have to leave now to list them…</p>

<p>Just discovered that ipod touches only sync with one computer at a time; if you want to sync with a new computer, you must forget the old one and erase all content from your ipod.

<p>Since my brother got his ZuneHD and started showing it to people, we’ve been able to get one person to buy one (two including my friend who’s getting one on her birthday) and have gotten 2 more people to seriously consider getting one, one of which is an “ipodfag”. There are also 3 more people who bought a ZuneHD without our encouragement. I’m sure many more would buy one if they had the money.</p>

<p>EDIT: Also, forgot to mention about the software. The Zune software is awesome, and easy to use, you just drag and drop to copy stuff to your Zune. As well, it automatically downloads all of your album info for your songs, and I’m not sure if the Software or the Zune does it, but for all of my artists on my Zune there is a bio, pictures, and discography and related artists. I didn’t do any of that, it was all done automatically. As well, the automatic Podcasts are nice.</p>

<p>Also, I very much suggest you install audiosurf it’s really fun. And at all the people who go apps apps apps apps, buy a netbook or, if you only use game apps, a psp.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So, your argument that the Zune’s apps are superior is based on a single game? No matter how good that single game is, you’re still talking about one game compared to literally swathes of others.</p>
<p>Your dismissal of apps because they’re inherently not part of the music player you’re trying to market is like saying that you shouldn’t cook anything but rice in a rice cooker. Everyone does, and that’s a big reason why people buy rice cookers, but trying to market one that doesn’t and just claiming that that’s “not what you should do with it”, isn’t a valid argument.</p>
<p>The Zune is competing against the iTouch. Not a netbook or a PSP. And if you are comparing them against the netbook or the PSP, the latter two win at everything but size and weight. And, since it is competing against the iTouch, it has to cede that it looses on the amount of apps. There is no argument in defence of this.</p>
<p>And just by the by, a lot of the games I’ve had a ridiculous amount of fun with on the iTouch are free, whereas all the games on a PSP (and most of the games on a netbook) cost money.</p>

<p>Well…that IS also a useful feature of iTunes. Ever notice that little folder in your My Music folder called “Automatically add to iTunes”.

<p>You know, you CAN organise your own music (if you’re truly that pedantic). Just drag the new music into iTunes once you’re done organising.</p>
<p>What you’re saying is that after completely organising it, Zune automatically picked up the music. Except, iTunes just requires one step more than that; you need to drag the folder tree that you’ve set up into the Library section of iTunes, and it adds all the music (assuming that you’ve set it not to automatically arrange your music, but god knows why you’d want them arranged any other way).</p>
<p>The only time I’ve ever had to wait a substantial time for iTunes to do its thing is when I’ve been adding 12,000 songs in one go. And I really don’t do that very often.</p>

<p>This is the problem with all these threads; these products are as much about fashion as they are about functionality - a lot of the discussion fundamentally comes down to the concept of choice and opportunity cost; you pick one because you can’t have, or want, both. Hence, your choice is often driven by subjectivity based on your fashion preference, not your objectivity. Its the same with laptops; so much of them is now how they look that the better looking products dominate over the worse looking products, even if the uglier ones are better value for money (cf. Macs).</p>
<p>That said, however, I think your side of the fence lacks some of the objectivity that you really need when buying such a product, and you shouldn’t let your blatant Apple-hatred blind you from even the <span class="bbcode-i">possibility</span> that you’re just a tiniest bit wrong.</p>

<p>more memory used by iTunes means the less memory for the rest of the system = slower performance for everything.</p>
<p>The problem comes down to the fact that iTunes is a streamlined, polished, well working application…  when running on a mac. Everything about itunes was devolped and optimized for mac, then it was quickly ported to windows. I use OSX quite often and the music player of choice is iTunes, But when I comes to windows… I’ll stick with the zune media player.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just an FYI, the Zune social will be down for 24hr starting today. There upgrading a bunch of stuff and Microsoft stated that there will be new updates for the program and all of the existing Zune devices will have a new firmware upgrade available.</p>

<p>I just timed iTunes and Zune starting up and delay before I could play a song.(cold start, aka just reset the computer)<br>

</aside>
<p>Yes, I go onto my external HD via Windows 7 Libraries make a new folder with the artist name then inside that another folder with album name and release date then put the files inside said folder, it’s a 10 second process. Unless you’re horribly slow at making new folders, but that’s one’s own problem. So, even if I am at a friends computer or I am away from my desktop, I can still organize my music via my folder structure and naming system, then the next time I plug that external drive into my desktop Zune will have that music ready to play in the time I can type the artist name to search for it.</p>
<p>Also being that I have a laptop, I can install my Zune software to it, I then take said external hard drive, plug it in, and being that I set Zune to monitor the drive when it can, any new music I had from my desktop, is ready to play on my laptop. No fucking around with library files, album art files. It just works. Oh wait, isn’t that supposed to be Apple’s line?</p>
<p>Also, If by some chance I find a album name or artist name was misspelled in the actual windows folders, I can rename them and Zune won’t freak out and put a ! next to the song and then needs to be manually relocated. It just sees it as a new artist/album and adds it, notices it’s already there and changes the path…all streamlined like.</p>

<p>Why add extra steps? Isn’t the whole philosophy behind Apple to be “simple”. I found a much better alternative and I’m probably going to stick with it unless something better comes along…like if Winamp pulls their head out their ass or Songbird starts to not suck.</p>

<p>*Yes, I do have more than one artist with the same name from different countries. Granted this can be done in iTunes (Country only), but when it comes to wanting the albums to be in order of release year, something I have to do myself.</p>

<p>This is the problem with all these threads; these products are as much about fashion as they are about functionality - a lot of the discussion fundamentally comes down to the concept of choice and opportunity cost; you pick one because you can’t have, or want, both. Hence, your choice is often driven by subjectivity based on your fashion preference, not your objectivity. Its the same with laptops; so much of them is now how they look that the better looking products dominate over the worse looking products, even if the uglier ones are better value for money (cf. Macs).</p>
<p>That said, however, I think your side of the fence lacks some of the objectivity that you really need when buying such a product, and you shouldn’t let your blatant Apple-hatred blind you from even the <span class="bbcode-i">possibility</span> that you’re just a tiniest bit wrong.</p>

<p>I got a Zune because I was sick of Apple, I was sick of iTunes and it’s bloated ass, I was sick of trying to import music to iTunes only for it to not want to import and I had to make a carbon copy of that file in an MP3 converter for iTunes to import. I was sick of waiting 5 minutes for iTunes to import an album, I was sick of piss-poor battery life (even after getting a new battery), I was sick of iTunes inability to show album art at the rate my scroll wheel could browse my library. I am not using Apple products because of their business practices, I’m not using Apple because of their practice of marking up a product because of a logo. All of these are reasons I would never buy an iPod again compared to “fashion”</p>
<p>I’ll take functionality and speed over a god damn logo.</p>

<p>Oh now please, you’re being ridiculously camp here. You and your ilk have said some patently wrong things here to stir up some Apple hatred, and regardless of how you got to that conclusion of not buying Apple products, you’re trying to make us hop on the bandwagon with some pretty major logical fallacies. Clear up your arguments a little and bring in some moderation, then I might even take you somewhat seriously. Until then, please take your straw men, factual irregularities and complete impossibilities elsewhere.</p>

<p>Except that doesn’t seem to be where you’re stopping; you seem to continue well past that point and into the realm of “I’m right and everybody else is wrong and they should know it”. Garthbartin has taken to proclaiming himself the absolute kind of illogicality, and if you want to see some truly absurd arguments just read back through this thread, and his other Apple-hate threads. I’m sorry for lumping you both into the same category, but I’ve found that misinformation has played an annoying large role in this particular saga.</p>
