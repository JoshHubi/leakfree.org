    <description>So, I bought the game yesterday, and I love it, but the one problem i have had so far was, When I start the game, Its just a black screen with the cool music where its supposed to say &quot;Black Mesa&quot;, instead, I hear the music with a black screen and then the game starts, Is this a bug? or was it taken out? :?:  :?:</description>
