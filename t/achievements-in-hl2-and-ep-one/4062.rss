    <title>Achievements in HL2 and Ep. One</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/achievements-in-hl2-and-ep-one/4062</link>
    <description>I have whole Orange Box installed, but there is one thing i that does not works.

In Half Life 2 and Episode One there is no &quot;achievements&quot; button in menu, and of course there are no achievements in game. It is weird, because in TF2, Episode Two and Portal it works perfectly. 
Is there way to turn achievements on?</description>

<p>This added achievements and HDR to HL2. However, since the recent ui update for steam, achievements broke.</p>

<p>I…I felt so lonely…<em>sniff</em></p>
<p>Cinematic mod’s very subjective. Let me ask you this; did you care deeply about Aztec and Jester when they were killed off in Crysis? High-res textures aren’t always what make the character. Hi-res Alyx, to me, just looks like “some chick with breasts”, not a person.</p>
<p>I think Valve left out HL2/Ep1 achievements so that the console versions get SOMETHING unique after the TF2 fiasco.</p>

<p>And I doubt people would see those achievements when they see your profile, so it’s like a PS2 game, you work a little bit for the achievement, and when you unlock it, it’s like “Meh, that was kinda pointless”.</p>

<p>Um nope, Keep looking around. There’s an update I’ve found earlier that gave you updates on the engine and the achievement system as well. I’d show you it but I’ll have to wait until I get home to do that. I’ll place edit to it on this post once it’s there.</p>
<p>Also, you should all get the Half-life 2 cinematic mod 10. It updates Half-life 2 to what it should have looked like before some assholes hacked it. (Replaces textures) The file size to dl the whole thing is about 10GBs. The reason why it’s so big is because it also includes both the episodes. You can dl them individual by parts since they separated knowing it would be a pretty big file.<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>They didn’t exist at the time, so no. HL2 and Episode one were both made and released individually before the Orange Box was started, and before achievements were introduced. You’ll also notice that HL2 has no HDR (the option is there, as it’s global for the engine, but it’s not utilized as it didn’t exist at the time HL2 was made.)</p>
