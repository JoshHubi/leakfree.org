<p>This is why I think Half Life 3 isn’t happening (yet?)… Due to the nature of Valve noone is taking up the task, they’re all too scared to get together and go… So HL3, shall we? haha.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure I can see Black Mesa as official canon when it changes so much, but it’s definitely good enough to get noticed, I’d say. Valve have a history of hiring indie developers, funding their projects and turning them into massive hits. It’s what gave us Portal  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Black Mesa is definitely fit to be a legitimate release game itself, and that - to me - makes its developers well fit to be paid for what they’re doing. Hell, I’d have bought Black Mesa if it were being sold.</p>

<p>Valve does not have a rigid structure like most other companies. They are free to do whatever they want, within reason (e.g. a programmer on TF2 can’t start working on L4D2 as an artist because they feel like it.) In fact, their employee manual (leaked onto the internet) states that “out of all the people who aren’t your boss, Gabe is the MOST not your boss, if you get what we’re saying.”</p>

            <p>Valve will hire anyone who passes their interview process. I suspect a few of the BM devs would pass if they applied, but it’s hard to say. Just because you’re very good at making games (which the team here very clearly is) doesn’t mean you’d be a good fit for Valve. They look for a lot of very specific qualities in people.</p>

            <p>If any of the team members went into the industry, wouldn’t it make sense that they got picked up by Valve? I mean it is a job, in which you get paid, and you get to make awesome games. I’ve talked to a game developer who said it is everyone’s dream to work for Valve. It is like the Pixar of game development studios.</p>

            <p>^ That’s the problem right there.<br>
Besides, I know that Raminator has said that he has no desire to work in the gaming industry anyway, he’s far too busy being Greg from CSI for that.</p>

            <p>I have a prediction…After everyone at VALVe realizes the quality of this game, the Black Mesa devs will be asked to visit VALVe HQ where Gabe Newell will hire them all. After hiring them though, their first assignment will be to finish up the Xen levels so that it will release faster. Since there is a lot of confusion about what VALVe originally intended to do with Xen, (The Vortigaunt Uprising, Combine Control, etc…) VALVe and the dev team working together will help Xen be even more official storywise.</p>
