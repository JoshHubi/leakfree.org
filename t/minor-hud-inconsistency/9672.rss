    <description>I noticed that when you get slimed by a bullsquid, it can leave slime on your suit and gun. However, if you switch weapons (say, from a pistol to a grenade), your suit will be unslimed before it would fade normally. If you quickly switch back to your first weapon, it will be slimed again.

Would it be possible to create additional &quot;suit only slimed&quot; models/animations to correct this?</description>
