            <p>Maxey hit it right on the head. Sure, the basic level can have stuff for kids. The actions scenes and the awesome one-liners… But in order to be a respectable movie, there needs to be something for the adults as well.</p>

            <p>Well crafted intemporal stories will captivate both kids and adults. It just needs two layers of storytelling: a straightforward layer that is just the basic performance of the actors and the development of the plot, which any kid and adult can understand; and the subtle layer, which encompasses the backstory/lore told through visuals or sound, the more subtle facial expressions, the lines of dialogue that have a double meaning and other stuff of the sort, all those things that only adults or the more discerning kid will get.</p>
<p>The original trilogy had that in spades because they were handled by competent writers and directors. The prequels were handled by a hack that has no idea how storytelling works.</p>

<p>Like you said its really all ages not children even for the prequels but the elements meant to appeal to kids where intrusive and annoying to adults.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah true. George didn’t seem to really understand what made the original trilogy so successful and captivating for all ages. In the prequels, the tone was really all over the place, as though he was trying to keep the attention of tiny kids and adults by just quickly swapping back and forth between silly humor and dark srs bsns. Ah well. The prequels were just a complete mess.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, kinda…it was more a movie for all ages. Something anyone could enjoy.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of people use the “it was made for children!” defense for the prequels, but all the dull political dialogue, brutal on-screen murders of adults, implied off-screen murders of children, mutilation and immolation kinda puts a damper on that theory.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Surplus_Ninja</span>: The original star wars was fantastic, but there are only so many ways they can rehash the same formula. And I was not thinking exactly of the original trilogy, but more the prequels and the recent star wars cartoons. There is far too much appeal to a younger audience, which is nice and dandy for simple profiteering, but it ruins the star wars brand in the process. Do something new and unexpected, and the hype of the remaining two films will increase immensely. And once again, I’d argue that the movies lacked depth precisely because the idea of adding a moral gray area would confuse a younger audience. And I think that star wars could seriously benefit from subverting the expectations of the viewer by breaking their usual “good vs. evil” type storytelling, as evidenced by many fantastic bits of storytelling in the extended universe.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/danielsangeo">@danielsangeo</a>: Absolutely valid points. You are probably right.

            <p><span class="mention">@Surplus_Ninja</span>: The original star wars was fantastic, but there are only so many ways they can rehash the same formula. And I was not thinking exactly of the original trilogy, but more the prequels and the recent star wars cartoons. There is far too much appeal to a younger audience, which is nice and dandy for simple profiteering, but it ruins the star wars brand in the process. Do something new and unexpected, and the hype of the remaining two films will increase immensely. And once again, I’d argue that the movies lacked depth precisely because the idea of adding a moral gray area would confuse a younger audience. And I think that star wars could seriously benefit from subverting the expectations of the viewer by breaking their usual “good vs. evil” type storytelling, as evidenced by many fantastic bits of storytelling in the extended universe.</p>

            <p>Well, if they’re going to be bringing back the main cast from the original trilogy, I can’t really see them doing the Thrawn storyline because the events a mere five years after RotJ and the actors are too old to be reprising their roles in such a fashion.  Now, if the story was about the Solo children and Darth Caedus, that might work.  Maybe the Yuuzhan Vong War?</p>
<p>(And, tangentially, the person calling themselves “Han Shot First”, I must protest.  My opinion is that it should be “Han Shot”.  Poor Greedo never got a shot off.  Though, in the original writing, Lucas made it vague. After Greedo’s final words, “There was blaster fire and, when the smoke cleared, Greedo lay slumped over the table.”)</p>

<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]This isn’t always a bad thing. Literary complexity is good but there are lots of perfectly good and valid reasons not to have it.  The original Star Wars played on typical tropes and things related to "The hero’s Journey and just in general really old story telling.  Its an adventure series it was science fantasy not science fictions and doesn’t have the expectations of intellect that sci-fi has.</p>
<p>The extended universe wasn’t held back by the expectation of being easily understood by children,</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]This obviously isn’t why star wars lacked depth<br>
so it could explore much more adult themes.<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]star wars wasn’t ever meant to be an “adult” thing, the very first film was rated PG-13</p>

</aside>
<p>Simplicity in literature and film isn’t stupid.  What is stupid, is putting complexity in a narrative that serves no purpose and doesn’t add to experience or literature. Just because the expanded universe shoe-horned in some adult themes doesn’t mean it was a good thing.  Maybe it appeals more to you but then it would sound like the original star wars probably didn’t appeal much to you either.</p>

            <p>Hate me for this, but I’m a sucker for the Extended universe, and I’m sad that they aren’t following it. I do acknowledge that a massive amount of shite in the extended universe, but there is also a lot of really great ideas explored. Admiral Thrawn, for example, is my favorite. A non-human rising in the ranks of a largely racist Empire out of necessity, and his view that the Empire needs to exist for lasting peace, it creates a brilliant gray area. Same with the Yushong Vong war, which makes the existence of the empire and the Emperor justifiable. Or how about exploring a less black-white approach to the force, as the jedi aren’t always portrayed as pure good and the sith as pure evil? The extended universe wasn’t held back by the expectation of being easily understood by children, so it could explore much more adult themes. I’m just deathly afraid that they’ll once again ditch anything of significance in exchange for simple audience exposure. Considering the recent star wars projects (Star Wars the Clone wars, Star Wars Rebels) I am having serious doubts, as these two shows are just sooo… dumb and childish at times.</p>
