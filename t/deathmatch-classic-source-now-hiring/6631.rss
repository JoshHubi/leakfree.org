<p>What’s the point? It’s a remake of an old game that was an imitation of Quake. I’m sure this team will be hell-bent on including all the old physics exploits, so why not just make a mod of DMC to add some new lighting effects &amp; make a high-def pack?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s better to make a new start, because nobody plays old games anymore. HL1 is fkn awesome, but not enaugh players. DMC died because VALVE killed the bhop and imo. But anyways… I prefer Quakeworld, because of smaller playermodels, faster gamespeed and better graphics (There are some custom clients with new effects, high res textures, config presets etc…).<br>
Same with HL1. I play HL1 for a long time now and the gameplay is a lot fairer with bhop, because it gives you a better chance to flee from your enemy when you just spawnd and have a weapon-disadvantage. (…and no, I don’t like the sprint function of HL2, it can’t replace the skill-based bhop movement qualities…) further there are not many people who like HL1 graphics. They think they are too low-ressy and not “real” enaugh. I’ve not seen many graphic-improvement projects for HL1. Imo there is no need for BMS, if there was an updated version of the GoldSrc Engine. HL1 plays perfect with all these “exploits” and the graphic style is cool, too imo. Similar to TF2 maybe (except the models)…<br>
The point is that Source is a newer engine with a bigger popularity… so BMS will make sense… For graphic-fetishists, people who like to see HL1 with HL2s real-life graphics style and young, new players who don’t know anything about HL1.</p>
<p>In Singleplayer it’s always better to not have bunnyhop or other expoits, because it’s better for atmosphere and design. Sprint could make it more interessting, but I think the game gets too easy when you are able to shoot while sprinting… So I hope it won’t be possible in BMS.</p>

<p>Except they’ve said they’re not. BM not only takes advantage of the source engine’s light rendering but also physics engine, facial animation system, npc AI &amp; so on. Not to mention HL1 has a huge fanbase, while DM:C… not so much. If the mod doesn’t catch on from the start, it probably never will, because it needs players to survive, while single-player does not.</p>
