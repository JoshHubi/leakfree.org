    <title>HECU HL1 Radio chatter swap - now w/ original dialogue.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hecu-hl1-radio-chatter-swap-now-w-original-dialogue/11143</link>
    <description>So far, the consensus seems to be that the community is split in half over the newly recorded HECU lines - some adore them and find em &#39;funny&#39;, &#39;over the top&#39; and all that jazz (whatever), while others (me included) - find them quite a bit inappropriate for the setting in hand (especially the C.BaleBatman &#39;gruff&#39; versions).

So for those of us who are discontent - I&#39;ve decided to compile a &#39;consolation pack&#39; that includes both situational and scripted original HECU radio chatter from good ol&#39; 1998.

[align=center][font=&#39;Impact&#39;][COLOR=&#39;DarkGreen&#39;]BM Source - HECU HL1 Radio Chatter Swap (Version 2.5 - OAR/ST Uncut compatible)[/size][/font]

[b]Work done:[/b]




Added static bursts (&#39;_comma&#39; ) to the end and the beginning of every transmission included in the previously posted pack (credit goes, assuming he actually compiled those, to [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14414&#39;][COLOR=&#39;Green&#39;]OpticalSnare[/url]) since those were curiously omitted by the OP.
Reshuffled/Cut/Reedited some of the transmissions that made little sense during playtesting. Stuff like marines yelling out Shakespearean monologues (i.e. &#39;We Gotta. Get. Out. Of. Here&#39;) after dying is now eradicated.
The groovy &#39;WE. WILL. KICK. YOUR. ASS.&#39; is now included as a taunt#2 (fucking surprised the original pack&#39;s creator fucking missed it - what the fuck, man).
Cut apart and edited the original HL1 dialogues to fit the &#39;format&#39; of Black Mesa recordings. Relevant choreo files are edited accordingly (apart from the apprehension scene, which didn&#39;t need it) with correct timestamps and compiled into a new scenes.image file.



[b]Included in the download[/b]:




All the relevant sound files.
All the relevant re-edited choreo files along with the original ones (marked as &#39;_backup&#39;) for easier referencing.
Recompiled scenes.image file along with the original one.
All the necessary save files needed for you to immediately playtest.
As an added (optional) bonus - some original HL1 music was brought back where I thought it would fit better than what vanilla BM currently has.

P.S. Everything has been playtested and should work fine.
P.P.S. Yes, I do have too much fucking time on my hands.
P.P.P.S. Hubi fix the fucking spacing already.</description>

            <p>I’d start working on it now, but in the light of recent news about the new version of the publisher royally fucking up on people…<br>
It really just involves a lot of listening and typing on my part (as the pack is practically over with), but with until the recent troubles, I dunno if I can be bothered as I that would mean tapping into a valuable (unpaid) vacation time.</p>
<p>Sucks.</p>

<p>That soundbite of Mike was freaking wonderful, it’s going to be fun fighting him! Err…wait…</p>
<p>Also ODB you seem very experienced with the NPC lines of HL and BM, do you know why the HL vox has a lot of unusual phrases that I (think) have never heard such as idiot, adios and amigos? Were these just lines recorded for modders or as part of some E3 demo?</p>

<p>Question: Will this work with other “mods” like the two “Uncut” chapters? I know there was some issue with something overwriting something else (apologies for being Source-illiterate). Because if there are not technical issues, I’d love to have this.</p>
<p>Black Mesa’s voice acting can be really spotty and the writing doesn’t make it much better. The dialogue seems to recognise only two kinds of people: Nerds (scientist) and Jocks (soldiers). And the soldiers don’t really sound like soldiers, they sound like petulant teenagers. The iconic line of “I killed ten dumbass scientists and not one of 'em fought back. This sucks.” which came across chilling in the flat tone with which it was delivered has been transformed into what I can only describe as a cross between a roid-raging blockhead and an 13-year-old boy who just got killed in Call of Duty multiplayer. RAAARGH!</p>

<p>Two words and two words only - it works.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s the idea. I was always a proponent of that the game should <em>feel</em> like good-ol’ HL (not necessarily look like it) - so after  my first playthrough I have spent a considerable amount of time compiling a number plug-ins that brought in the old vibe back - everything from music and weapon sounds to old vort skins.</p>
<p>P.S.S. Oh and Mike’s audition was brilliant. Especially this bit:<br>

Hopefully with some solid directing we get a result.</p>

            <p>Well, that’s very good to hear. To try and be polite about it, the current soldier writing and dialogue is not very good, so I’d love to hear what the team has come up. Especially if they got an actual veteran marine to help on the matter. This should be good.</p>
<p>Still, until the Steam version of Black Mesa comes out, this mod should be a good holdover.</p>

            <p>The last one is from Opposing Force. Funny, OP4 had that ‘My dogs are barking’ line too.<br>
I know they are conflicting - but at least it’s proper army talk now instead of, you know, beavis and butthead</p>

            <p>I love how you give life to them. Although, considering that the HL1 voices are cold and professional, it’s a little conflicting in theme. At least I think so. But good job on restoring HL1 content.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>That’s the problem with BM - there’s no way to decrease the game sound levels separate from music.  If you start increasing decibels - it will start peaking. Blast pit suffers from the same problem.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am reserving this post for an update, since upload speeds are really low today. Bear with me.</p>
<p>EDIT: After a playthrough with the new sounds, I have to say that I was mostly satisfied with the package. However, some rough edges had to be polished and on top of that:<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/4_f7Ddf-DIw" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">No more raep jokes, marine.</a><br>
I know it is far from perfect, the timing’s a bit shite, but you know what. I am rolling with it.<br>
The update does not overwrite the sound files in <span class="bbcode-i">12DumbassSci </span>folder. Therefore, old blob file (scenes_old.image) is included for those who want to keep the raep joke.</p>
<p>As for rough edges:<br>
-Lines have been adjusted, bits and bobs here and there<br>
-Music has been tinkered with: Valve’s theme reworked with Dragonmask’s suggestions in mind, Blast pit theme (Nepal Monastery) - quite unfortunately gets muffled by tons of noise, so is swapped for HL2’s remix of Sirens in the Distance. Nepal Monastery (amplified) is still included as BP4.</p>
<p>Light version w/out alien_slave sounds is now abandoned due to author running out of fucks to give. It’s all in a single pack.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s version 2.5, which I consider final:<br>
<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/download/ugcz398ggnfe6ca/BMS_-_HECU_Radio_Chatter_Swap_v.2.5_(OAR_%26_ST_Uncut_compatible_-_all_inclusive).rar" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">BMS - HECU Radio Chatter Swap v.2.5 (OAR &amp; ST Uncut Compatible)</a>[/SIZE]</font></p>
<p>P.S. Fun suggestion. Copy over all sounds from HL1’s /vox folder into BM’s own /vox folder, than play through We’ve got hostiles.</p>

            <p>I know it was in HL1, I’m just saying I can respect the Black Mesa team’s original vision. I already said it was a close call for me.</p>
<p>Edit: I think your version of BMS - ST2 is actually a little bit late. The build up of the song leads to a surge in the music <span class="bbcode-i">just</span> as the jets fly by, and while I would have thought that’d be good, I actually prefer it to be just before. If it is at the exact same time as the jets fly by, the song gets muffled by the sound of them flying by. I think it’s better if it’s like half a second quicker. Just a suggestion. Oh, and it could use an audio boost to really allow the music to shine, I felt your version was too quiet. I boosted my copy of the Valve theme by 10dbs.</p>
