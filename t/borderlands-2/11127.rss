    <description>Seriously guys, no one created a Borderlands 2 thread? I am dissapoint. 
Anyway, I&#39;ve been having a great time, level 13 Commando, just been soloing so far and its awesome. They really have fixed up all the issues the first one had and expanded on it in nearly every way. Oh yeah, and it has a proper story this time!</description>

            <p>Yes, you should get BL2. It’s got a ridiculous amount of stuff in it that should justify the purchase, and keep you busy for quite a while.</p>

            <p>Still undecided if i want to buy this game or not. Are there any other FPS/action/adventure type games that are new or coming out that I should be thinking about? I don’t like to spend money on games often (last game I bought was Skyrim).</p>

            <p>At first I was not so interested in it, because the first one was pretty flawed (but still fun), but after the first hour or so you can already see all the improvements and effort put into this. Funny dialogues, dynamic battles with good ragdoll physics and overall cool physical effects (of course only on PC), very innovative environments/areas, awesome cartoonish graphics, better guns, great soundtracks, a huge variety of enemies, better quests, better npcs etc. etc. If this doesnt get atleast NOMINATED for GOTY, id be pissed.</p>

            <p>I’m seriously considering jumping to the PC version of this. My main reasons to play the Xbox version were friends and the Borderlands 1 bonuses, but seeing as both of those were crap(lol jk, my friends just don’t own the game because they pre-ordered Crap-Ops II :/) I have no real reason to play it on Xbox.</p>

<p>And yup, Blues! I’ve been looking for games that take place in Antarctica, and the ice is so well done in Borderlands 2 that I’m considering a good replacement for it. The locations are amazing!</p>

<p>YES. The ice effect made me go ooooooooooo the whole time I was there in the first area. Quite a lot I stopped just to look around. The music is, also, very nice. Timings tunes and everything. This was just from the first hour of so in game play I felt the same way.</p>

            <p>The game does feel a bit lonely at first (there is only one inhabitant in the first town you see) but later you get to Sanctuary, and they really added a lot more interaction with NPCs. They make little comments every time you talk to them, and you get some fun quests (like Claptrap’s party, but I will not spoil that one). So, get it nao! It’s really good, and the icey environments are incredibly well done - the ice looks so real, it’s even a bit scary :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>Last question, after playing a hell out of the first Borderlands and Bioshock, please tell me that this one doesn’t have this “ghost town” effect… at first I liked it being alone in a post-apocalyptic/science fiction worlds and all… but I’d like some more NPC interactivity, dialogue, events to feel the world is alive and occupied because I got depressed from things being too quiet.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you can wait awhile, yeah you should wait for the GOTY edition as it may be cheaper to do so. If you can’t, buy the game on Steam or whereever. See if you can purchase the Season Pass for the DLC’s as they come out.</p>
<p>Currently I have the game, but I got it with my GTX 660ti. I am buying the Season pass mainly because the game itself did not cost me a thing.</p>

<p>So the game is actually good? Hmm… haz level 67 Soldier in the first one, didn’t bother finishing the DLC on 2nd playthrough, as getting to max level consist just from:</p>
<ul>
<li>port to Eridian Promontory, kill everything</li>
<li>do it for as long as till you are lvl 69<br>
To get decent loot:</li>
<li>port again to Eridian Promontory once ur max lvl and open the hidden red chest till a decent Legendary drops</li>
<li>do it again</li>
</ul>
<p>Please tell me, the sequel isn’t like this.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It isn’t:<br>
1)There is a lot more interaction between you and the NPCs<br>
2)Missions are more varied and interesting(most of them anyway)<br>
3)Legendary loot can be obtained through various ways :s cavenging,missions,buying,golden keys,playing slot machines…<br>
4)The game is EVEN funnier this time around<br>
5)It actually HAS a story(unlike the first one)</p>

            <p>So the game is actually good? Hmm… haz level 67 Soldier in the first one, didn’t bother finishing the DLC on 2nd playthrough, as getting to max level consist just from:</p>
<ul>
<li>port to Eridian Promontory, kill everything</li>
<li>do it for as long as till you are lvl 69<br>
To get decent loot:</li>
<li>port again to Eridian Promontory once ur max lvl and open the hidden red chest till a decent Legendary drops</li>
<li>do it again</li>
</ul>
<p>Please tell me, the sequel isn’t like this.</p>

<p>Seriously guys, no one created a Borderlands 2 thread? I am dissapoint.<br>
Anyway, I’ve been having a great time, level 13 Commando, just been soloing so far and its awesome. They really have fixed up all the issues the first one had and expanded on it in nearly every way. Oh yeah, and it has a proper story this time!</p>

<p>Yeah,I’ am playing solo as Commando too,level 19 .The game is really good so far,the skill tree is tricky(can’t decide what to choose ,invested in all 3 so far)but thank god for respec.Is it me or is the singleplayer somewhat harder this time around?By the way,dying Nomad’s “Don’t scavenge my stuff” always cracks me up  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  .</p>
