    <title>Borderlands 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/borderlands-2/7626</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know about you guys, but i loved the first, and to hear that [url=https://www.borderlands2.com/]Borderlands 2[/url] has finally been announced is music to my ears :retard:

Anyway, what do you want from the second game/improvements on the first. Personally, I would like to see more detailed environments, maybe some sort of weapon customization for the millions of guns in the game. Well I say millions but you often found a lot of very similar weapons so some variation there would be nice.

One last thing is i would love to see them do more with the different characters and classes this time round, as much as I enjoyed the characters in the first I felt there could have been a lot more done with them.

So guys, opinions?

Edit: details on changes can be seen [url=https://www.qj.net/pc-gaming/news/game-informer-details-borderlands-2.html]here.[/url]</description>

            <p>From what I know about the production of the first BL, I don’t think they had a choice in the sparse story and shit ending.</p>
<p>There was kinda a Halo 2 thing going on where there wasn’t enough time to finish so they had to cut shitloads of content and focus on polish.</p>
<p>That being said, I too am disappointed at how BL turned out on the PC front, but I can’t really complain because I had it gifted to me anyway.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ll be wary upon purchasing their product again with how the last release went. A few changes like:</p>
<p>non-console suited interface for pc users</p>
<p>field of view that isn’t set for, again, console users</p>
<p>multiplayer actually working upon release and not having to wait until the first dlc is released for a patch that fixes connection issues</p>
<p>actual varied/random weapons and not an easily-editted .ini file that has all pre-determined guns in it</p>
<p>give us better control over options in the game with more abilities to change toggles, such as crosshairs/crouching, or (again…) FOV range, push-to-talk option right out of the box instead of an always-on mic control</p>
<p>so yeah, there is plenty more that peeved me about my purchase (pre-order at that) of the original and total disregard for the PC consumer, with what was told to us in interviews (“this game will look best and play best on pc. we’re not porting to pc, we’re starting there”) and what we actually ended up getting.</p>
<p>one last thing: make the game longer with an actual ending and don’t depend on dlc to make it a full game.</p>

<p>Edit: So it looks like we’re getting pretty much everything we wanted in the new game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">    happy days. I read in the original article announcing the game that the world will be more varied and detailed also, but so far I’m liking this change list.</p>

<p>True, she was, but at the very least Mordecai was competitive with her, and Roland was nice to have around.  In Knoxx, because of the different elemental types of Crimson Lance, Mordecai is in the back seat with Roland, and Brick isn’t even with the group anymore.</p>

<p>I think the whole lack of story and extreme grinding in the first BL was due to a constantly shifting release date suddenly pushed too close… idk. There’s audio files still hidden in the game folders that contain whole chunks of would-be-important exposition.</p>
<p>As for the grinding I didn’t really mind because it’s not typical RPG combat where you hold down a button or do some other uninvolved stupid shit to kill and gain XP. It’s an FPS. I found grinding fun for this reason. Instead of holding down LMB to slay some pigs in a forest with one repetitive attack animation for points I’m shotgunning alien dog’s heads off in mid air as they’re pouncing at me. For points. A bit more variety in the AI and enemies however would make the grinding much less grating for those who don’t enjoy it tho.</p>
<p>As for what I want, I want more consistancy in the art style. You’ve got characters like TK Baha and crazy earl that are pretty stylized and awesome looking, then you got Dr. Zed/ Ned, the bandits, cept the bruisers and the midgets and the badass psycho,(but the badass psycho and the midgets are just vert edited psychos… which I also didn’t like), Scooter, and all the civillians that looked pretty realistic but they just had outlines slapped on em.</p>

<p>If Borderlands 2 is anything like the first then i’ll be extremely happy with it, not to say it could use improvements.</p>
<p>I agree with your statement on grinding, it would be nice if they made it a bit more interesting but as you said it’s pretty fun anyway seeing as it’s an fps.</p>
<p>Only just reading your comment i realize that somethings in the game are a little out of place, but it never really bothered me to be honest, I like the art style as it is.</p>
<p>Really to have a decent improvement, the game just needs a bigger sense of story and less repetitiveness throughout. But some extra features like weapon customization would be really sweet, and a bunch of other classes with more distinct abilities and game play styles.</p>

<p>She was OP in the first place. Equip your hellfire, firehawk and your volcano, and you can basically kill anything in the game within 2 shots.</p>

<p>Borderlands 2 needs more variety and less quantity, when it comes to guns and enemies.</p>
<p>Most of the weapons were just slightly modified versions of existing models.</p>
<p>Also, less grinding and more focus on story and more original quests.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the whole lack of story and extreme grinding in the first BL was due to a constantly shifting release date suddenly pushed too close… idk. There’s audio files still hidden in the game folders that contain whole chunks of would-be-important exposition.</p>
<p>As for the grinding I didn’t really mind because it’s not typical RPG combat where you hold down a button or do some other uninvolved stupid shit to kill and gain XP. It’s an FPS. I found grinding fun for this reason. Instead of holding down LMB to slay some pigs in a forest with one repetitive attack animation for points I’m shotgunning alien dog’s heads off in mid air as they’re pouncing at me. For points. A bit more variety in the AI and enemies however would make the grinding much less grating for those who don’t enjoy it tho.</p>
<p>As for what I want, I want more consistancy in the art style. You’ve got characters like TK Baha and crazy earl that are pretty stylized and awesome looking, then you got Dr. Zed/ Ned, the bandits, cept the bruisers and the midgets and the badass psycho,(but the badass psycho and the midgets are just vert edited psychos… which I also didn’t like), Scooter, and all the civillians that looked pretty realistic but they just had outlines slapped on em.</p>
<p>And all the player characters except Brick seem to be the old realistic models vert edited to be a bit more exaggerated.</p>
<p>I just want a more unified look.</p>
<p>Borderlands had a lot going for it but it was rushed and it showed. I’m sure BL2 will be shitloads more refined and shitloads better.</p>

            <p>I don’t think I’ve ever played any game from start to finish as many times in such a short span as Borderlands.  Character development and specialization is unique and interesting, the immersion of the game is outstanding, and it gets a huge thumbs up from me for having such a strong emphasis on coop.  I love the way each team member’s mods, when coordinated, make the team exponentially more effective with ammo regen, health regen, etc.</p>
<p>I more or less agree with the rest here, though, that the game could use some extra NPCs (unique NPCs, not retreads).  It would also be nice if there was more variety in the maps, and hidden/special areas to find.  Still, I’ve got nothing bad to say about the game, and I can’t wait until this next in the series is released.</p>

            <p>the special abilities i think need to be way better balanced, i was at a point with lilith where i was pretty much unkillable which, although entertaining to plow through anything guns blazing… took pretty much any need for skill out of the game. I also wasn’t able to play as any other class cause their skills i didn’t really find that interesting. or fun to use, so i got caught in a “fun to use but over powered, or not really fun to play and i dunno about how over powered cause i never got far with them”</p>
<p>Story is another big thing, or at least take out the mindless really boring quests which were all over the first game.</p>
<p>and finally, i agree, customization over quantity. make the sheer number of guns be based off of how extensively you can customize them instead of just sheer amount of progressively larger numbers in the stats.</p>

            <p>The increased effectiveness of Lilith in Knoxx changes everything.  She kills things so much faster with the same weapons as the other characters. (assuming you’re using the right elemental effect for each enemy)</p>
<p>Mordecai can ignore shields, which is great for pretty much the entire original campaign, and looses it’s oomph when you go up against almost every enemy in Knoxx being Crimson Lance.  Elemental effects are mostly wasted on Mordecai because they damage shields, while the bullet itself completely bypasses the shield.</p>
<p>This all depends on your build, of course, but the “best” builds (IMO) for both classes have increased elemental effects, and ignore shields.</p>
