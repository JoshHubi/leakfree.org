    <description>Sorry, simple question, but I&#39;ve created my channels in Faceposer and I cannot seem to find the .WAV files needed for, well... giving my 3d Model something to say.

They don&#39;t seem to be in the .wav finder, and filtering for vo/guard or guard or what have you doesn&#39;t seem to show up with anything.

Mind you, Black Mesa is loaded into it when I open.</description>
