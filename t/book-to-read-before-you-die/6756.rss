    <title>Book to Read Before You Die</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/book-to-read-before-you-die/6756</link>
    <description>In accordance with the title, I want you to put one book that you would say everyone has to read before they die.  I think it&#39;ll be really interesting to see what people will recommend.

For me, that book would have to be: The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy.

On to the books![/SIZE]</description>

            <p>1984 is one that everyone should read imo. The movie adaptation that was made in 1984 is quite close to the book too, but it doesn’t substitite reading the whole thing. I found a copy of The Art of War at home, is it worth reading anyone?<br>
Also I recommend reading Do androids dream of electric sheep by Phillip K. Dick, the book that was adapted into Blade Runner.</p>

            <p>lol who reads?</p>
<p>The only books I ever read were…</p>
<p>Holes<br>
1984<br>
Barny’s Adventure</p>
<p>And I regret wasting my time with those. 1984 was pretty good tho, they should make that into a video game. Then I’d be WAY more interested</p>

            <p>^^ Actually they do, near the very end around when he discovers the book about Prometheus discovering fire and just before he goes insane and decides the best course of action is to a destructive rampage… ya… I think the ending more or less ruined the entire point of that book.</p>
<p>I’m going to go with “The Stories of Ibis” by Hiroshi Yamamoto. Partly to break up the predictable string of classics, but also because it’s an excellent read. Presents an interesting view on a future where robots have taken over and uses this setting to analyze human nature.</p>

            <p>The unabridged Arabian Nights as translated by Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton, my personal hero. It is a badass middle eastern fairytale that real men have read to them as a bedtime story. Beautiful poetry, fascinating narrative, and a complex structure give it extremely high marks from me. And seriously, check out this guy</p>
