    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/best-worst-moments-in-gaming/13129</link>
    <description>I hadn&#39;t seen a thread bout this so...

Here, we discuss your best/worst moments in your gaming adventures! Talk bout things like favorite or least favorite glitches, epic wins or fails, etc.

I&#39;ll start:

I was playing Battlefield 1942 yesterday on wake island (I believe) and decided to try and bomb the Japanese battleship into submission. In the midst of doing a run, I turned to come back and ran into the carrier. Since that wasn&#39;t my target at the moment, I did a sorta loop the loop over in order to go back towards the battleship. As I turned, near the end of my dive, the anti air pounded my plane, and with little escape, I was forced to bail onto the jap carrier. I landed and turned just in time to see my own plane safely land, without exploding, on the deck behind me. It was even in decent enough condition that I could repair it and take off again.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was playing Terraria with my friends and we were trying to evenly distribute +max health crystals, and I hadn’t gotten any in a while.<br>
When my friend found one to give me after 20 min. of searching, he said “Hey, Slendgy!” and meant to throw it but accidentally used it right in front of me.<br>
I knew it was an accident but part of me wanted to punch him.</p>

            <p>I’ve played so many games where there’s a frustrating section that kills me over and over and over, and then when I finally pass it, I either get killed by something easy or just walk off a fuckin’ cliff because I forgot I was holding the analog stick forward in my joyous outburst of getting through a shitty section.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Playing Planetside 2. I got into a dogfight against two mosquitoes (TR factional fighters). I got outmaneuvered, and with my plane on fire, managed to fly low enough over a small ledge to jump out safely. They followed me, and tried to pick me off flying in close. I then, by pure instinct, pulled out my unguided rocket launcher, snap-fired… and blew one of them up with a direct hit. Dodging madly, I reloaded, fired at the other one, and managed to kill <span class="bbcode-i">it</span> too.</p>
<p>A third fighter flew in, hovering a ways off the ledge and fired a burst of rockets at me. I dodge, fire off a third rocket, and manage to narrowly miss it. I reload, fire a fourth… And it hovers straight up, over my rocket, and cuts me down with its nosegun.</p>
<p>Such an adrenaline rush. Also, you can carry a lot of rockets in that game.</p>

            <p>Best:<br>
Metal Gear Rising: Reveangeance.</p>
<p>Forgot the worst moments whoops:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finishing Modern Warfare 3. First time a game contaminated others not just of it’s own franchise, but other games generally.</li>
<li>Knowing that STALKER 2 would never be released.</li>
<li>Knowing that Metroid: Other M still fucking exists.</li>
<li>Losing all my good gear to lava while playing Terraria (OBSIDIAN WALKING BOOTS WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY)</li>

            <p>Best: Prosper Bluff in Bastion.  The moment when Rucks says, “Then the kid hears something he ain’t heard in a long while,” and you hear Zea start playing Build That Wall from over in her little oasis.</p>
<p>Now <span class="bbcode-i">that’s</span> atmosphere.  That’s motherfucking <span class="bbcode-i">aesthetic.</span>  I can’t off the top of my head think of any moment in any game that made me feel the way I felt there.</p>
<p>I happens at about 45 seconds in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCl-8jM645k" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCl-8jM645k</a></p>
<p>The worst for me was probably anxiously awaiting the release of Half-Life 2, only to find that the PC I owned could only play it as a slideshow.  Even so, I played up until most of the way through Water Hazard before giving up.  And then I waited until March 2006 before I had a PC powerful enough to play it.  Those 2+ years where that fucking Collector’s Edition box just sat on my desk, mocking me…</p>

            <p>Necropooooooosssstttttttttttt</p>
<p>…to say that I’ve had an excellent and very memorable moment in BF4 today. On that one conquest map with the dam, I shot down a jet with a well timed RPG. However, it gets way better. This jet then rocketed it’s now less mobile and smoking carcass straight into the (at the time) falling apart dam. And with that last little explosion, I collapsed the dam.</p>
<p>Seriously, it was just a huge wow moment you’d see in some adrenaline pumped action war movie.</p>

<p>The first race had two guests neck and neck for half the course, and the orange car in second managed to take the lead in the last ten seconds. SO TENSE. OMG.</p>

            <p>Hmmm, I do have fond memories of kicking an enemy down a set of stairs in Dark Messiah, and watch his body take out a group of enemies right behind him… Kinda like bowling, but with human and orc ragdolls. Much more fun.</p>

            <p>I had an awesome one Skyrim today.</p>
<p>Normally, I don’t ever get the execution moves on enemies. However, in the end when I had killed Ulfric and had exited the building, I saw Tullius talking to the soldiers. Bored, I took advantage of the situation and used my shout to knock em all down. This had them all at me with their swords out. What commenced next was…spectacular for me haha I literally mopped the floor with them. Left and right, I was chopping off heads, stabbing, slashing, and hacking em all down. I felt like a complete badass.</p>

            <p>Getting good at dogfighting in Warthunder. Nothing quite screams ACES HIGH like that.</p>
<p>I also recall a time in Planetside 2 where we were pushed back into our continental warpgate and made an massive offensive southwards which resulted in us capturing most of the continent. Theres something extremely exciting about running with over a hundred guys on the flank of an enourmous tank column, kicking ass and taking names. All set to some Blind Guardian.</p>

            <p>Best: Half-Life 2 was my first ever FPS, and I didn’t get it figured out right away. The first time I ran through Ravenholm, I didn’t understand how to use the gravity gun or the traps as weapons, so I just used my stockpile of ammo to blast my way through all the zombies. Eventually, I ran out of ammo and had to learn gravity gun combat in a hurry. I picked up a sawblade, waited until about a dozen or so zombies were all lined up in a corridor in front of me, and sat there gaping as they all got perfectly bisected.</p>
<p>Worst: The fucking wall-run cross jump in Mirror’s Edge, and in particular that one segment in the ship. You know the one.</p>

            <p>Best: Control Core Angel in Borderlands 2. I just really love the music and colour scheme there. It’s also the only actually enjoyable instance of Loader combat in the game.</p>
<p>Worst: Either Gunman Clive’s impossible eighth level or that fucking shitty satellite thing in Bad Company 2.</p>

            <p>Fallout 3, just after exiting the vault, will be one of the most memorable things I’ll ever do in a video game. It was absolutely wonderful.</p>

            <p>I guess if I had to pick a “best” gaming moment, it was my entire run through Persona 4 the first time. It was just so consistently good, and the story just sucked me in. I played almost nothing but that game for a month straight and it never got old.</p>

            <p>Best: Setting a scoring record that required you to take a photograph of the screen and mail it to the manufacturer only to find out that the photo didn’t come out well enough to actually see the score.</p>
<p>Worst: Being placed in charge of a Team Fortress clan, after only being with them a few weeks, and then having to assign players to their positions without knowing the skills of any of them. Had to make sure that every player got equal playing time which meant that all I was doing was watching matches and assigning times and positions without ever getting a chance to play myself. Ended up quitting after just a few more weeks of that hell.</p>
