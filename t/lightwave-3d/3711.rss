    <description>I&#39;ve never worked with this useless junk before considering I&#39;m a Max modeller, but I have an .lwo scene which consists of ~100 objects that I need to export as one .obj so I can open that in 3ds Max.
The problem is if I open the scene I can&#39;t export it as .obj, and if I open the modeler I can only export one object at a time. :meh:

Any way to just export the whole damn scene as a single .obj? Thanks..</description>
