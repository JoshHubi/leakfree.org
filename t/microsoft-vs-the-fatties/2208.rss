Got this from another Forum, but it gave me a few giggles and so I thought I&#39;d share it with you all here. Basically the idea is your Avatar will reflect what your medical records say about you, so if you&#39;re overweight, it will affect the apperance of your avatar and even ban you from entering certain competitions on Xbox Live. Looks like we won&#39;t even be able to escape our real lives anymore  :frowning:</description>

<p>How is pestering an overweight guy by making his avatar fat the same are giving someone who’s depressed advice?</p>
<p>This is more comparable to saying the depressed guy in your example is a dumb-ass and should cheer up. It doesn’t help shit.</p>

            <p>I doubt Microsoft would force this on all their users. Microsoft wants money, they’re not going to spend money gathering health information on their subscribers so they can alienate a % of their user base who might end up unsubscribing because it’s;</p>
<p>A) Humiliating for some, or ;<br>
B) A violation of their user’s privacy.</p>
<p>My guess is that it’ll be some random service available for those who want more accurate representations of themselves on XBL through their Avatars. Maybe it’ll make use of Project Natal?</p>
<p>Anyhow,  I highly doubt Microsoft will do anything major with this.</p>

            <p>Though this discussion seems to be cross at the descriminating aspect of this patent, I find the gross violation of users privacy through acces of health records far more disturbing.</p>
<p>How certain are you of this article’s, I can’t imagine any private enterprise having access to such information, especially for multinational services that would need to deel with privacy laws from all around the glode.<br>
So wouldn’t the weight be entered by the player, meaning it’s not so much descrimination, but just relies on what they want to type in?</p>
<p>Also in regard to what some people have answered me;<br>
-Drunkards and drug addicts are just as much of a problem, probably worse, yes, and prevention is important.<br>
-In reply to Doom, there’s not much one can do themselves about heart failure for instance, and unfortunately the sheer amount of obese people here (I live in the UK, way fatter than the NL) shows that some are unwilling to do much about it regardless of the effects, much like persistent smokers.<br>
Similarly to smoking I think people should be as free as possible, but their rights musn’t tread on those of others, " Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else". It is fine if someone is willing to be fat, it is their body, but this might disrupt others, examples can range from petty, such as fat people forcing elders to stand on the bus, because their arse takes up two seats, to more worrying such as diverting vital hospital funds on larger equipement.</p>
<p>Considering my last point, I condemn this idea, because it seems to discriminate and violate privacy should it be mandatory in order to use an other service.</p>

            <p>Victus and all you other dumb asses need to be hurt, I’m 6’0 weighing about 200 pounds which according to Germany’s military is fine for my BMI, but before joining up I was pretty over weight and just because someone is over weight and company thinks they can get away with discriminating against a certain type of people just because they are over weight? That’s obviously going to have some major back lash and I forsee Microsoft getting sued, a lot.</p>
<p>These kind of people are the same ones that complain about how being a Homosexual is a “sickness” Seriously, next microsoft will start discriminating against them. Maybe some people just are not concerned about their physical appearance? Maybe they just want to enjoy their life as much as they can without any sort of work? Who are we to tell them they cannot live their life the way they want?</p>
<p>Obesity is not a sickness, it’s a choice. If they choose they do not want to put the effort into loosing the weight, then we have no right to force them to do so. People like me who wanted to loose the weight and did so, CHOSE to.</p>
<p>Most “unhealthy” people that are obese than it MAY be a contributing factor but it is not the DIRECT cause of being sick. Perfectly normal, fit humans can die of Heart attacks and obtain diabetes(That’s the right word, yes?).</p>
<p>What ever idiots decided to do this, obviously did not speak to the PR department in Microsoft.</p>
<p>TL;DR:<br>
Microsoft = Dumb<br>
No one has the right to tell someone else how to live their life, no matter what.<br>
Obesity is not a sickness, but a choice in ones lifestyle.</p>

<p>Go play second life then. A lot of people play online games to be someone their not and to experience another lifestyle outside of what they have be it good or bad. It’s an escape and dragging those things with you into the virtual world opens up a new road to internet bullying and can cause serious problems.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, I’m not saying base the game entirely around your life, but use features from it to, for example, make some NPCs more relatable by having them be the same race as you, same or different gender, etc.</p>

            <p>Microsoft’s strategy is something really close to insanity. Who gave them the power to ban people based on the ammount of weight they have (also, if you guys read the end of that article, you will se that the avatar soon will not reflect only the player’s body)? Some people became fat (or obese) not because of an incompetent vigilance, but because of emotional, psychological or biological problems (endocrine ones).</p>

<p>I doubt Microsoft would do this since it doesn’t seem very profitable, and like any other company, they’re all about making money. I think some overweight gamers might use this feature were it optional as a means to spur their otherwise weak willpower into losing weight</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>wise, but problematic. People choose to play games instead of doing something to lose weight. This thing attacks the freedon of choice of the player. Rather than getting this option available, why do you simple try to convince people  to take care of their health instead of playing, ah, Halo or Half-Life?</p>

Of course a great many obese people are so without any fault of their own, and I believe they need help.<br>

</aside>
<p>If healthcare is done well then obese people don’t have to be a problem at all, also, people who actually get health problems from being overweight will most of the time do something about it themselves. People don’t WANT to get sick.</p>
<p>I believe anyone should be able to be as fat or thin as he or she wants, health effects are their own concern. And no-one has to provide any “incentives” for this, people are already getting enough bullshit about watching their weight from the common media.</p>

            <p>Uhh, Isn’t this invasion of privacy and discrimination at its best? Since when did huge corporations get a say in what you can and can’t play based on your physical health, especially when you’re the one paying for the fucking product? This won’t encourage fatties to get off the couch at all. It doesnt end at obesity either:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">“The physiological data can be gleaned from a third party health data collection repository, a healthcare smart card, a real-time physiological sensor (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose, peak flow, pedometer, etc.)”</span><br>
Why would Microsoft want those details from a gamer?  To make avatars more realistic? Bullshit. Maybe they’re compiling a huge database of everyone so when the time comes they can active the mind control chips…<br>
I bet this was dreamt up by the same douchebag marketing team that came up with the Windows 7 Launch Party.</p>

            <p>Funny how you mentioned ‘fat’ people when in fact, the biggest strain on the NHS is teenagers.<br>
Alcohol abuse and Drug abuse is high among teenagers and is putting more of a strain on the NHS than ‘fat’ people.<br>
The NHS does it’s job though, and ‘fat’ people, as I said above, are far less of a burden than teenagers getting wasted and causing injury.<br>
We need a new system on how the NHS dental system works too, they need to pay dentists for <span class="bbcode-i">prevention</span> not just <span class="bbcode-i">curing</span>.</p>
<p>It would also help if Parliament spent less time on bureaucracy and more time on sorting out this country’s problems!</p>
