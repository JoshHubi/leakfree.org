    <title>Major stuttering issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/major-stuttering-issues/9524</link>
    <description>Tried installing this game multiple times now, and each time it&#39;s the same. In the menu i get constant audio stuttering and the game locks up for a second or 2 all the time. I also get this ingame. I have a Crossfire IV motherboard with a Nvidia HD onboard audio card aswell as Nvidia Geforce 570 GTX GFX card. I don&#39;t have any issues with any other game but this. It runs smoothly inbetween stutterings, so there must be some bug somewhere.</description>

            <p>I had the same problem with Phenom II x6 and a 570GTX and what fixed it is<br>
mat_queue_mode 0<br>
it enables a different type of single thread processing.<br>
Now it runs smooth.<br>
mat_queue_mode 2 is for multi thread but it crashes so just type in 0.</p>

            <p>I get the stuttering in game, seems to have gone when I have disabled SLi in the Nvidia Control Panel. Appreciate this doesn’t apply to the OP but may help someone.</p>

            <p>Mm, it may be because there is no multi-core rendering. When I play, I also get these stutters, as well as pretty annoying frame rate drops. I opened the game in windowed mode so I could look at Windows task manager to check my CPU usage, and sure enough, core 0 was just about maxed out leaving the others pretty much untouched. I hope there is at least some possibility of multi-core rendering in the future. Otherwise, this mod is phenomenal so far!</p>

            <p>This is probably your processor having a hard time.<br>
If possible enable multi core rendering in the advanced options menu, if that’s not possible:<br>
