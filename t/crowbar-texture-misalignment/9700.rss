    <title>Crowbar texture misalignment</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crowbar-texture-misalignment/9700</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

Long time no see.  Just wanted to let you know that the handle texture of the crowbar (red part) is misaligned such that the edges of the texture line up with the center-line of the model.  It&#39;s kind of difficult to explain even though its such a simple thing.  Here&#39;s a picture to better explain what I&#39;m talking about.

Not sure exactly how that happened.  I don&#39;t remember it being that way ~6 years ago, but I&#39;m not entirely sure.  I could have screwed something up.  Anyway, just figured I&#39;d let you know.</description>
