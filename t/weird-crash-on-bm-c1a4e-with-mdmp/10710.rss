    <title>Weird crash on bm_c1a4e (with mdmp)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weird-crash-on-bm-c1a4e-with-mdmp/10710</link>
    <description>Alright, after the game crashed whenever I tried to transition into c1a4e from the level before, I now got it to do at least that (I jumped down instead of using the ladder). And now, when I arrive at the bottom of the silo and get out of the water, the game crashes.

But not just like that.

Get this: I step out of the water, collect the shotgun ammo (or not) and turn around to go to the door... that&#39;s when it crashes. When I turn around. What.

I tried walking backwards toward the door, and with that I&#39;m indeed able to at least stand next to it. But it won&#39;t open (pressing E on the switch does nothing except the &quot;nope.&quot; sound. You know what I mean). And in the position I was standing (left shoulder against the door, looking at the switch), I took one more step backwards... crash.

It could also be that my memory is cloudy and the way further is not through the door, but through the water. So I took a dive. But as soon as I reach the position where the door is above the water: crash.

Crashdump is attached.
