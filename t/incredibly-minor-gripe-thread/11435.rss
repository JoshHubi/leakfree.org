    <title>Incredibly minor gripe thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/incredibly-minor-gripe-thread/11435</link>
    <description>There have been lots of threads with people complaining about Black Mesa&#39;s big problems (balance issues, bugs, etc.), but I haven&#39;t seen much in the way of small complaints. 

So I ask, what are the little things in BM that bugged you? It can be as small and insignificant as you like.


Personally, I don&#39;t like how Gordon lowers his gun while sprinting (with always run off). In most games, the player character lowers his gun so the player will know that shooting while sprinting is not an option. But in BM, you [i]can[/i] shoot while sprinting, so it&#39;s totally pointless. It looks really silly when you&#39;re sprinting and you have your gun lowered, but then you fire it and it just pops right up for a moment. I kind of hope there&#39;s a way to disable this, because it sort of bugs me.</description>

            <p>I personally hate how the marines went from using citizen base animations to combine soldier animations. Sure they needed quick grenade throwing and melee butting, but the citizen animations seemed more human in the early screenshots that way.<br>
Not like the developers wanted to portray them that way, The voice acting for the HECU is enough injustice.</p>

            <p>Don’t know if this is a minor gripe or not, but oh well.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ichthyosaurs are underwhelmingly weak HP wise. If they’re going to be that squishy, they need to swim faster to make them a real threat. I personally increased their HP so they require 4 total crossbow hits, up from 2 (I increased max ammo on crossbow from 10 to 15 to ensure I don’t just destroy my supplies so quickly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The music/sounds feel random. Maybe that’s how it was in half life (i cant remember the music to be honest even though i played it like 3 weeks ago), but it’s odd. I love the tracks like in the outdoor scene of WGH, fight in QE, and the dam scene of ST. Otherwise it’s very silent, not even slight abient music playing.<br>
I don’t want a soundtrack or anything playing at random, but it feels like you get 30 seconds - 2 minutes of music, then it’s quite for another 30 minutes.</p>
</li>

</aside>
<p>That is because the explosion sounds in BM are garbage at best (This is not with the tinnitus effect, I mean the sounds as they sound without it, when Gordon is far enough away.). How the BM team allowed it to pass through relative to the mostly great gun firing sounds is beyond my scope of comprehension, it sticks out like a sore thumb. Our best hope of rectifying this is to replace it ourselves I think.</p>

<p>Are you thinking of the deafening percussive effect of a nearby explosion? I believe the idea is that it temporarily deafens you, thus you don’t hear much of anything for a few moments.</p>

<p>I think you’ve answered your own problem there. Black Mesa is entirely repurposed from an existing facility, some of which clearly date back to the 50s/60s.</p>

            <p>I understand the whole “variation of air crafts” thing, but honestly that scene was kind of hectic. Trying to fight like 7 HECU people, then blow up the tank. I did watch the alien and military aircrafts for a bit, but it didn’t really click that they weren’t different until I came to this thread (not saying it’s an bad opinion, I just personally didn’t notice).</p>
<p>On to my own minor gripe (I guess they’re minor).</p>
<ol>
<li>Bullsquids are basically walking turrets. They don’t charge like a bull anymore. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">
</li>
<li>In Surface Tension and Forget about Freeman, they don’t really have enough HECU vs Alien combat sequences. It’s like they just chopped them all out and didn’t try to re-implement them anywhere else. It kind of ruins the whole “Humans are losing control of everything” immersion aspect to me.</li>
</ol>

<p>Dotard, I hate that argument so so so so much. Just because something is a game doesn’t mean you can cut corners or remove common sense. Hell, even the Black Mesa devs know that! That’s why so many places from Half-Life were redesigned to make more sense. They didn’t just say “Oh, it’s a game, we don’t have to make this seem plausible or anything.” I commend the devs for actually putting some thought in the mod rather than leaving everything weird because it’s a game and doesn’t really matter. I think some things could have been improved, and having F-16s or something instead of Harriers would have been a better choice design-wise, but at least the devs tried to make this seem plausible.</p>

            <p>I honestly don’t care about it, its a small detail in the game.<br>
If something like this occured in the Arma series then it would be a problem.</p>

            <p>Would it actually be worth the man-hours required to create new models and textures for a single scene that most players don’t bother to look at, much less scrutinize the details of?</p>
<p>The low utility of something like this does not justify the work required to make it.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter, it’s an inconsequential detail. The average player doesn’t even know/care what model of jet fighter is that supposed to be or that not all jet fighters are supersonic. Besides, what counts is the message that scene conveys, not the technical details.</p>
