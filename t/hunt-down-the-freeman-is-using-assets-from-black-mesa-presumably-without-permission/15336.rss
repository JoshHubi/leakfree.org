    <description>This post is not trying to condone any sort of Witchhunting, but merely to Inform the Community, and Crowbar Collective, of the Issue taking place at this time.



As some of you may be aware, [url=&#39;https://store.steampowered.com/app/723390/Hunt_Down_The_Freeman/&#39;]Hunt Down The Freeman[/url] released 18 hours ago on Steam.

Upon release, it was noted that the game was very buggy, shipped without the 36GB of Cut-scenes, and made heavy use of [i][b][u]Stolen Assets[/u][/b][/i][u],[/u] Including Maps, Weapons, Models, and Enemies.

[url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/app/723390/discussions/0/1692662484246530833/&#39;]Steam User Fourmula has been attempting to compile a list of all these stolen assets.[/url]

Of note, is that it has been confirmed that [u]Hunt Down The Freeman is using the Vortigaunt Model from Black Mesa[/u]. It is unknown if any other assets have been stolen, at this time.

Other Stolen Assets to note:
-Stolen Zombie Panic : Source map
-Multiple Stolen Garrys Mod addons and maps
-Stolen FireArms:Source assets.
-Stolen running animation from Payday 2
-Stolen Killing Floor 2 Weapons
-Several Models stolen from a FUZE Model Pack
-Stolen Car Model from Stalker
-Multiple assets from Half Life 2, L4D2, DoD:S, and CS:GO used Blatantly, Including .VPK&#39;s</description>

            <p>surprised there isn’t more topics like that really knowing how braindead the steam forums could be. hell I reported hunt down the freeman before it was released do to the fact there where signs it was a scam, like the fact they only showed bits from SFM videos and closups that made no sense in context.</p>

            <p>looking through images, they defenantly took a few textures from the mod version and I think a wet floor sign but not sure. links to images found on its image page… and damn it looks like babies first mod.</p>

<p>but yeah, there is a lot of l4d assests in it, and many assests from other games and mods. hell that AR is from another mod, I forget the name but it takes place during the events of half life.</p>
<p>EDIT: yep found one thing in screenshots people have taken that might be stolen, and that looks like the sniper beam.</p>

            <p>Isn’t the BM vort model just the Episode 2 vort model using the slave shackle variant you see in HL2? (The Ep2 vorts having been backported into HL2 in the '09 update)<br>
Not that I don’t think HDTF is crap, or that I doubt that there’s fishy stuff going on, but between that and the HL2 trainstation maps that are part of the SDK content as examples there are some thing being thrown about as evidence that… isn’t. I’m not 100% sure about the Adobe FUSE stuff, but I seem to recall the license for that being along the lines of “If you make it in FUSE you can use it for anything you like”</p>
