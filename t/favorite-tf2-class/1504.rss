    <description>I don&#39;t really know why I have the urge to make this thread, but oh well. Pretty self explanatory, just don&#39;t post your favorite to play, but the one you find is the most badass, funny, etc. My favorite is the Scout. Some of the greatest quotes in video game history.</description>

            <p>I can play as all and I like them all.<br>
So I guess my favourite class is the “Random” selector.</p>

<p>Scout. I think scouts with FaN or/and sandman are scrubs. Bonk users are free kills.</p>

<p>One of my most epic scout caps was on dustbowl, stage 2, I swapped out to Bonk! as I had an idea, there was a sentry gun in the corner pinning us down and no one wanted to be medic and get and uber, and all spies kept dying, so I used the sentry gun’s fire to catapult me out of the spawn and straight onto the first point, pulling us out of the ditch the team was in.</p>
<p>But I do hate bonk.</p>

            <p>Fair enough. I do like hiding in corners and at the last second, they get suprise on fire.<br>
plus he/she/it/they remind/s me of the simple pleasures in life and the sheer, unbridled joy of doing what you love.</p>
<p>The Sniper is the opposite, to him, the whole thing is just a job, nothing personal. He is here to do his work and anything worth doing is worth doing well.<br>
Although after hours, I imagine he’s a real party animal.</p>
<p>The Pyro is obviously a music lover, and quite possibly the only one who could drink Demoman under the table.</p>

<p>The pyro, spray’n’pray?</p>
<p>Spray, sure, but I’ve never known them to pray. Pyros are all about maneuvering, to best unleash unbridled nihilistic sadism. It doesn’t leave many chances to pray over. :3</p>

            <p>Favorite class? The Spy. I really love the Spy, although I’m not very good with him. I don’t think I have the proper mindset for it or something. Maybe I just need to get more practice in.</p>
<p>My most played class is Pyro. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9sa6G4rCzQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">As you can see, I really like the airblast.</a></p>

            <p>I played some medic today. It was a lot more fun than I though it would be. My k/d ratio was shit, obviously, but you rack up so many assists… I’m definitely going to be playing more medic in the future.</p>

            <p>Ironically, my two favorites are the pyro and the sniper. Precision elimination and spray n’ pray. I love both of their personalities and styles. It’s fun to pick people off with Sniper’s air of professionalism and set people alight with Pyro’s sheer psychotic love of watching the world burn.</p>

            <p>I like Demo. I also enjoy some Scout action once in a while, but I really really suck at Scout compared to when I played daily.</p>
<p>I have played for only a few hours since the last update. I can thank that for being released around finals and then the holidays and Steam Sales.</p>

            <p>I have three I play with the most, Sniper at the top, Medic second, then Scout.  I’ve played as the Pyro a wee little bit, and tried out the Spy for a time.  But I’m most comfortable as the Sniper, Medic, or Scout, the rest I just can’t get into.  Especially the Engineer, I dunno why, I just never really feel I’m contributing anything as an Engie.</p>

            <p>I usually rotate classes for variety and according to the situation. I’m best playing front lines classes like soldier and heavy, but sometimes I just wanna stab someone in the back as a spy or run around and bat people as a scout. According to my stats…<br>
In the 13.1 hours I’ve played so far, Soldier is tops with 2.2 hours, 13 points, 10 kills, 2453 damage, 7:07 life. Demoman, engy and pyro are way down at the bottom with almost nothing, I just don’t like the way they play. The rest are around an hour each.</p>
<p>As far as personalities/lines go, scout and heavy are my favorites.</p>
<p>“You suck. No really, you all suck. It’s startin’ to bore me how much you suck!”</p>
<p>“I am credit to team!”</p>

            <p>Heh, for me the Engineer and the Scout are on the bottom of the heap by a longshot.  Demoman is really formidable once you get the hang of him, although I never have been able to best a pyro as a demoman (except by blind luck).  My “Most Damage Dealt” is currently held by the Demoman, something like 3012 I think.</p>
