</aside>
<p>yes, it can access 4GB of ram, but cannot actually use all of it because of the programm and data sections and the stack, which shrinks the actual usable memory for data to about 3GB(even less depending on what your programm does, e.g. lots of recursions, many constants, huge code etc.)</p>

            <p>yes there is the LAA flag, but it’s not used that often, mostly only seen it used for games.<br>
Even then you can’t allocate the full 4GB anyways, because you still have you programm code and stack.<br>
(btw, 3 words: large adress-space awareness)</p>

<p>Actually, under a 32bit OS, programs can only access 2GB of RAM, despite whether you have 4GB of RAM installed or not. Yes the system overall can access all 4GB, but the per-process limit is 2GB. While 64bit OS allows access to 8TB of RAM. So even 32bit applications benefit from an upgrade to a 64bit OS (yeah I said upgrade). And yes, modern day applications can exceed 2GB of RAM usage. I recall just recently of a game released that people were getting crashes with memory errors. Turned out the game used like 2.5GB of RAM and the people posting issues were running 32bit OS. Thus the memory crashes. The solution posted by the devs was upgrade to 64bit OS. 64bit OS also has increased kernel security.</p>
<p>So for all intents and purposes, yes it is an ‘upgrade’. Whether you think calling it an upgrade is “stupid” or not is irrelevant. Pretty much the entire IT industry considers it an ‘upgrade’.</p>
<p>EDIT: In addition… who the fuck only has a 2GB system nowadays? I find that point of your argument HI-larious.</p>

<p>We are talking about 32 and 64 bit not 4gb or more ram.</p>
<p>sigh… let me explain to you: 64 bit is not an upgrade, it’s not even an update. It’s just another version. You can have 2gb ram and still install a 64bit OS. Calling that an upgrade is stupid. Buying more ram &lt;- this is an upgrade.</p>

<p>It is and it isn’t.  You’re still running the same OS, but you’re still enabling your computer to do more.</p>
<p>And come to think of it, why is there even a 32bit Windows to begin with?</p>

            <p>The best bang for your buck you could probably get at this point would be two GTX 660 ti’s set up in SLI.  Performance wise, one 660 ti pretty much a 670, but cheaper.  And since a 670 is just a little less powerful than a 680 (which two of is a 690), then you’ll essentially get a little less than a 690, which is really fast.  Of course, it’ll be a little less powerful than a 690, but it’s not like any game is required to have GPU that fast anyways.</p>
<p>All of this is assuming you’re upgrading your computer, which is probably a good idea.  I good i5 Ivy Bridge is light years ahead of AMD.  And you’ll need at leat 4gb of ram (preferably 6gb-8gb),  and maybe an SSD for a boot drive if you have the cash, and a good ATX motherboard, which will allow you plenty of room for upgrade later.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>A serious tip here:<br>
Because your cpu would limit your graphics card a lot I would recommend buying a GTS450 or a AMD HD5770 or HD5750 or HD6770 or HD6750. These cards also would be limited by your cpu but your graphics card would not be the limiting factor anymore in your system. Buying a completely new pc would give you the biggest benefit.</p>
