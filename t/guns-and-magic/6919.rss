            <p>Lucas’ biggest offense in the prequels was definitely explaining the Force away with scientific technobabble and make it lose its mystical status.</p>
<p>No one asked him to reveal the true nature of the Force but he did it anyway and by doing that he made the Force as wondrous as someone having double-jointed fingers.</p>

<p>Get over yourself Mr. “I hate the new films because things are actually being explained”</p>
<p>It’s a Star Wars title made by George Lucas, it’s canon.</p>

<p>You have… NO IDEA… how many people disagree with you.<br>
It’s not even that the story was bad, it’s just the new movies were so childish and silly.</p>

<p>Darth Maul was awesome though.</p>

            <p>I think they are shitty books because it’s blatant plagiarism. It’s the star wars plot with characters stolen from other fantasy books.</p>
<p>read this, and then tell me if you still think they are somewhat original: <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Comparisons+between+the+plot+of+Eragon+and+Star+Wars" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://everything2.com/title/Comparisons+between+the+plot+of+Eragon+and+Star+Wars</a></p>
<p>It certainly is an accomplished job for an 18 year old, but age doesn’t make a book better of worse. This is nothing more than a glorified fanfic.</p>

<p>The inheritance books are shit.</p>
<p>“ok, I’ll take a lot of Tolkien, a lot of McCaffery, a good amount of Leguin, some Dragonlance, some Star Wars, etc. It will be a can’t miss book.”</p>
<p>The story is cliched, formulaic and barely passable as are the characters and the language is simply what you would expect from a17 year old. If you have any experience in the field of fantasy at all, reading Eragon will feel like a visit to Las Vegas --sure you can see New York and Paris and Italy, but they are mere shadows of the real thing.</p>
<p>McCaffrey’s telepathic link between dragon and rider is here, but not the powerful emotionality of her works.</p>
<p>LeGuin’s idea of one true name and one true language forming the backbone of magic is here, but not her masterful sense of order and balance and restraint, not to mention the sparse beauty of her language. And of course, the graceful, bow-carrying elves, the gruff and secretive mentor with magical powers, the withdrawn dwarves, etc. all show up in their correct place and time.</p>
<p>If you have little experience in fantasy and so won’t be bothered by the obviously derivative nature of this book, you’ll probably enjoy it but there are far better works to begin a lifetime of fantasy reading with and even if you start with Eragon, I hope you quickly move onto them</p>

</aside>
<p>I have read quite a lot of fantasy series by many different authors. While I will agree that there are quite a lot of similarities between other series and the Inheritance Cycle, calling it complete shit is beyond overkill. But still, you have your opinion, and I have mine. I think they are good books, you don’t.</p>

            <p>I love the inheritence cycle. I’m just waiting for the final book.</p>
<p>I think what people seem to not understand about magic is the manipulation of the area about you through natural means, not technological. If you think about what a fire is, you realise Fire is just intense friction that became visible and the heat is so intence it can keep itself going through various means. So to create a fireball, it’s the same theory just manipulate an area in the shape of an orb and heat it up to intense levels.in reality theres such a science behind the idea of magic that people don’t realize.</p>
<p>The force in the star wars series is magic because it’s manipulation of something through a jedi’s mind. or a sith for that matter. Thats why usually in stories or games, magic requires an incantation, a ritual or can be used instantaniously depending on the style. It’s a science, just like Technology.</p>

            <p>Honestly of all the fantasy series I have read, I personally like the magic in the Inheritance Cycle the best. That’s Eragon, Eldest, Brisingr, and the as of yet unnamed book for those of you who don’t read it. It’s explained in a way that makes sense from both scientific and mystical standpoints. Oh, and if you mention the Eragon movie in connection to the books, you deserve to be lobotomized. That movie was complete shit.</p>

            <p>Even in a game like Final Fantasy 7, “Magic” is not “Magic” because it’s logically just using little pieces of crystal to harness the power of The Ancients for combat, which of course must seem like magic to primitive humans.</p>
<p>That said, FF7, while not a shooting game, has both guns and magic in its themes. People seem able to take plenty of bullets though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HG:L has locked content you have to pay for that horribly dis-balances the game. (PC &amp; Console) even if it falls under the criteria of “magic with guns”.</p>
<p>It was made by the Diablo II team (old one, not the legacy team) after they broke off from Blizzard. That being said, it would fall under what you’re looking for, but I haven’t heard anything about it in a while. Latest is that its got locked content that you have to pay for to use/play (unlockable weapons, etc) and on it being just a base client, most of the shit you use is locked. Not really worth buying… it MAY have improved, but I can’t be sure of that.</p>

</aside>
<p>…you should´ve just said that the game was a total failure…similar maps, same monsters, …I was getting bored in about half of the game :meh:</p>
