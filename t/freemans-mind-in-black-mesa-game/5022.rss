    <title>Freeman&#39;s Mind in Black mesa (game)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/freemans-mind-in-black-mesa-game/5022</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s thought about it

It&#39;s more of a controversial subject

I personal think it would have it&#39;s own charm but it would still be more of the same (assuming we already play through BM before)
and I&#39;m not sure if anyone has posted this before (I&#39;m so lazy D :slight_smile: 
I wish to know your thoughts on weather on not somebody should or shouldn&#39;t make a remake of Freeman&#39;s mind in BM

I&#39;m saying No only because it would feel like repeat of what we already know as freeman&#39;s mind though that&#39;s just me

<p>Hopefully, BM will come soon because he’s getting close to the trash compactor scene.</p>
<p>I think it’d be funny if Gordon woke up in the trash compactor not only without his weapons, but without his glasses.  He finds a new pair, puts them on and sees BM’s graphics instead.</p>

<p>I Figured ppl would flame so I was prepared</p>
<p>on task*<br>
if Ross Scott doesn’t diside to do a Transition from HL: S to BM I won’t be a great loss<br>
as for Freemans mind for HL2 I think it would be too hard to implement interesting diologe and would fail (GO FAIL BLOG)<br>
it just simply has too much combat, to much human interaction, Too open, and feels like a step back from the good old Freeman’s mind were use to.:[:freeman:</p>
<p>(sorta off task)<br>
as for the other “Minds” E.I. barney’s mind.<br>
I find thoughs to unnatural to enjoy as much, along with to many referances to freeman’s mind</p>

<p>Well, seeing that it took him 29 episodes (including 10.5) to get to the middle of “On A Rail” and that it took him 1.5 - 2 years to do those 29 episodes, AND I heard somewhere that his graphics card burnt out, At this rate, he won’t wrap up the series 'til late 2012 or early 2013.</p>
<p>Hopefully, BM will be out long before that, and if Ross Scott decides to start doing Freeman’s Mind with BM rather than HL: S, I roughly project that he would be playing through “Surface Tension” when BM come’s out</p>

<p>Well, I know that. Sorry if I misspoke. What I meant to say was that Freeman’s Mind was originally an experiment done by Ross to see if could cut down production times for his videos. As you said, every CP episode is like a mini mod, he has to create a lot of stuff. He has said that he would rather do other things in the future, that he has some pretty cool ideas in storage.</p>

<p>^This.<br>
I don’t think he will continue the series with HL2. He has expressed on his page <a href="https://www.accursedfarms.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.accursedfarms.com/</a> hundreds of times that he does this series cuz its very easy for him to work on it compared to his other series Civil Protection (very recommendable BTW). Also, he said that he had tons of ideas in store and that FM was hardly one of best ideas he has came up.<br>
Whatever he is on to next I will watch it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  .</p>

            <p>Well, seeing that it took him 29 episodes (including 10.5) to get to the middle of “On A Rail” and that it took him 1.5 - 2 years to do those 29 episodes, AND I heard somewhere that his graphics card burnt out, At this rate, he won’t wrap up the series 'til late 2012 or early 2013.</p>
<p>Hopefully, BM will be out long before that, and if Ross Scott decides to start doing Freeman’s Mind with BM rather than HL: S, I roughly project that he would be playing through “Surface Tension” when BM come’s out</p>

<p>Wait, what? That means that the mod is going to be released after the summer of 2011???<br>
:fffuuu::fffuuu:</p>
<p>Now, really, I bet that the mod is going to be released before he ends the game (probably before he gets too deep into Xen).</p>

            <p>Like I said I didn’t research this so ya…<br>
and I suppose you’re right<br>
few minds are good so I don’t think anyone will but I guess it would be interesting for a bit</p>

            <p>I coulda swore I saw another thread similar to this before, but there’s very few people that make a good “HL Mind” video.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q:   Will you switch over to Black Mesa for Freeman’s Mind once it comes out?</p>
<p>A:   Maybe. I’m undecided, that might be a good transition for after Freeman blacks out.</p>

<p>That’s his take on it so… Just wait and see…</p>

            <p>I’m sure I’m not the only one who’s thought about it</p>
<p>It’s more of a controversial subject</p>
<p>I personal think it would have it’s own charm but it would still be more of the same (assuming we already play through BM before)<br>
and I’m not sure if anyone has posted this before (I’m so lazy D <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I wish to know your thoughts on weather on not somebody should or shouldn’t make a remake of Freeman’s mind in BM</p>
<p>I’m saying No only because it would feel like repeat of what we already know as freeman’s mind though that’s just me</p>
<p>GO FORTH AND FLAME MY THREAD!</p>
