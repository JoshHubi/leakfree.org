    <title>Halo series on PC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/halo-series-on-pc/13158</link>
    <description>with the advent of the death of Gamespy, now comes a debate/opinion fair, would/should old and new halo games come to pc (or just windows)?

it seems although halo is one of the ONLY console shooters that, frankly, didnt suck, it too is being overshadowed by the dark wrath of CoD and its unholy disciples 

would it be a good thing for the halo series to return back to its platform of ancestry? (i say ancestry because bungie used to be mac/pc, and also marathon; halo was originally fated to be the same before microsoft bought it off to be stuck with xbox for the decade that passed)

such games with high replayability and great lore deserve proper justice on a proper platform</description>

            <p>It’s perfectly feasible, and in fact I kind of recommend this, to go through Halo 1 Legendary without using anything but the plasma pistol (other than Hunter battles and Flood battles).</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. First, the plasma pistol can fire much faster than the plasma rifle just by pulling the trigger really fast, so there’s hardly any reason to choose the PR over it since it dishes out more damage quicker. Second, at least in Halo 1, plasma has a “stun” effect which means if you pepper an enemy with it, they become unable to fight back as long as you keep shooting them (which, combined with the fact that the PP fires as fast as you can pull the trigger, makes it deadly). Third, it’s probably the most common gun in the game, so ammo is almost never an issue. Fourth, the overcharge makes Gold Elites as easy to fight as blue elites since it renders their shields useless.</p>

            <p>In CS, I don’t consider that a two-weapon limit in the style of Halo. In CS, you have one very clear primary and one very clear sidearm, with one melee weapon and some grenades. The original CoD was similar, except you had two primary slots, plus one secondary (pistol) slot, and grenades.</p>
<p>In Halo, you have two weapons, period. That can mean a primary and a sidearm, two primaries, or two sidearms. In a way, it’s a bit less realistic than the CS weapon system but it also encourages some loadout creativity, which isn’t as real, but fits the “rock paper scissors” weapon balance of Halo quite well.</p>
<p>I never understood why CoD took the two-weapon limit starting from CoD 2. It doesn’t make sense for a game that at least attempts to have some semblance of reality, and furthermore doesn’t have any RPS weapon balance.</p>
<p>EDIT: As for Maxey’s post above… WHAT?! No way…</p>
<p>Hopefully he gets to work for 343i. As much as Davidge’s music was actually pretty nice, I felt like it wasn’t as seamlessly integrated into the game like Marty’s music always was.</p>

<p>Yeah, there’s totally a place for the two weapon system, and it really really fit the Halo series. But there’s other places that adopted the limited weapons system where the retro gun arsenal was sorely needed <em>cough</em>DNF<em>cough</em>. Depends a lot on the style of the game.</p>

            <p>Yes, they’re slower obviously but they work and it’s usually compensated by either the game getting paused or slowed down while you’re choosing your weapon. Rockstar pretty much nailed the weapon wheel starting with Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>It’s funny, Rockstar set the open world standard that everyone else copied but they won’t try to copy their amazing gameplay mechanics for some reason.</p>

</aside>
<p>CS has a two weapon limit because it seeks to drive tradeoffs and scarcity that are part of the competitive drive of the game. Games these days use the two weapon limit because controllers aren’t well suited to switching between a wide array of weapons. The reasoning behind the mechanic and thus it’s effect is completely different so I really don’t think that’s where the mainstream drew its inspiration.</p>
<p>Probably was Halo, which was heavily targeting the Xbox (seeing as Bungie was already whoring out to M$). Like Xalenar said though, they handled the limitation well. Other games haven’t.</p>

            <p>Halo made a lot of things popular that went on to be aped by other devs and run into the ground, yeah. They were done with discretion Halo though. Heal Regen works in Halo because all the other high level enemies have it too. The two weapon limit works because all your enemies and allies are using various weapons and you always have a nearly full arsenal available to you despite your limited inventory.</p>
<p>When COD took health regen, it didn’t take the healing enemies…or the smart ones for that matter… or the class separated ones.</p>
<p>When Bioshock Infinite took the two weapon limit, they didn’t take the enemies-having-varied-subclasses-with-their-own-arsenal aspect and you ended up with a room full of the same SMG after every fight.</p>

            <p>Halo is the series that pretty much proved that first person shooters, and later, online shooter multiplayer, could work well on consoles to the point where it becomes “the” popular game. As a result, many games started to borrow elements from Halo, including things that nowadays seem quite standard for a “modern” shooter but was not very usual or even somewhat absurd just a decade or so ago.</p>
<p>Regenerating health is just one example. I think the two-weapon-only-including-sidearm thing is another, and so is the designated grenade throw button. Correct me if I’m wrong.</p>
<p>I know CoD didn’t do any of those things until CoD 2, which I vividly remember thinking “wow they really want to be like Halo” while first playing it.</p>

            <p>I really don’t have an immersion complaint with the regen health in Halo. My complaint with regen health is primarily in singleplayer games where it really just doesn’t make sense. It encourages players to pop out of cover and fight wildly til they’re almost dead and then just hide in cover again. That’s not fun and that’s not skill based. It cuts a massive important level of depth out of the game. It completely removes the long term penalty for poor performance. It’s mostly just lazy game design for developers who can’t be assed to play test health kit placement and who don’t want to scare away casual fags who can’t handle limited health or ammo.</p>
<p>In multiplayers it’s really a completely different story. Which is better regen or not, depends on the particular game.</p>

<p>I forget, was it Halo that brought regenerating health to the mainstream of gaming?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>halo 1 still had health bars (and shield recharge was slowest in series iirc), though Halo 2 could be credited with bring forth such a concept;  it is worth noting, though, that Bungie went back with traditional Medkit mechanics of halo 1 with ODST and Reach (meaning either they renounced their influential game mechanic or they wanted to stay consistant with the lore)</p>
<p>at least when halo does health regen, there is credibility in it (lore states modern spartan suits have built-in infinite supply of biofoam dispensers)</p>
<p>seeing present-day soldiers in games get shot in the face by a desert eagle and fully recovering from such a thing in a matter of seconds, on the other hand, is absolutely silly and displays another example of good gaming mechanics gone bad</p>
<p>its sad that some games dont even try to properly immerse players</p>

            <p>I’d be very surprised if Microsoft doesn’t start supporting the Halo series on the PC. Whether that means they finally bring over Halo 3 and/or the alleged Halo 2 remake or they start with Halo 5 remains to be seen. But they are absolutely insane if they keep letting Valve steal their thunder on the PC. Then again, it’s Microsoft, so it’s possible they’ll continue to fuck up over and over again until PC gaming finally moves on without them.</p>

            <p>Console game from 2007 - a recent mid-range gaming PC could probably handle 120fps+ at 1920x1080… or maybe even downsample from / play at 3840x2160.</p>
<p>Is the crosshair in Halo 3 offset toward the bottom of the screen as it was in Halo 2?</p>

            <p>Damn, that game still doesn’t look half bad. A couple graphical mods and it’d look great.</p>
