    <title>Any other users having trouble with SourceSDK for CSS?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/any-other-users-having-trouble-with-sourcesdk-for-css/4647</link>
    <description>Im curious if others are having problems with Hammer for CSS, a few of my friends are also. When loading my map, or even creating a new map, I get a FATAL ERROR saying &quot;Missing material editor/wireframe&quot; and tells me to go check my configs and check if it is correct, which it is. I have also refreshed the content, and my friend has reinstalled SourceSDK and still there is problems. So if not any suggestions for fixing, is there atleast any other members here having the same issue?</description>

            <p>Ok, I see what you meant, and no actually everything else is fine for me, atleast as far as I know, every other 2006 engine game works fine, along with the other engines, it seems to just be CSS SDK.</p>
