    <title>Multiplayer Crash - dm_lambdabunker</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multiplayer-crash-dm-lambdabunker/14160</link>
    <description>Game crashed to desktop with no error message. I think I was mid-firefight when it happened, but not sure. Don&#39;t remember much other than the map.

This has happened to me a few times during multiplayer, seemingly (though probably not) at random.  Will send more dumps as they happen. Thanks.
