    <title>Come on already! Just admit it!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/come-on-already-just-admit-it/5315</link>
    <description>You havent done ANYTHING in terms of working on BM for years. If you have ever done anything on it at all.

A nice demo video for your portfolio doesnt even remotely prove that you ever intended to create BM. Show me some video of a real person actually playing the mod. 

If you refuse to do either, I will simply continue to call you out every couple of months. I mean it. I will bug you incessantly; well once or twice a year at least. Thats about how often  I remember to check to see if you have posted any videos yet.

Put your money where your mouth is HOAXERS!</description>
