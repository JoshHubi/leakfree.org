    <title>HQ Metal Vent textures</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hq-metal-vent-textures/13021</link>
    <description>I have made a high quality metal air duct / vent texture pack...I think the vent textures are a bit low res compared with the rest of Black mesa this gives the vents more detail. They are also bump mapped and shiny. the top image is out of date there is dirt on it now. It has taken me all day to do this but I am glad that I did.

Hope you enjoy the new looking vents that I have done

Download link V3 final.

[url]https://www.mediafire.com/download/cca2x4v6415d6tj/V3.rar[/url]

Extract the [b]New[/b] folder to your BMS directory and play through a level like office complex you will notice the difference straight away.

The old textures are also included to reverse the changes If you prefer the original look.

Enjoy

            <p>Thanks for the reply… I did not understand all the programs and plug ins but I will have to look into it.</p>
<p>I am improving on texture editing, it’s not my forte “art” but I am trying and I realize I screwed up the with the map tint in the vmt crypt was right on that but I was exhausted at the time and forgot to come back on these none the less I will try and update this at some point as I am making some new ones for WGH extended and they will be much better and I’ll probably update this pack with them when I have re-done them proper.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t qualify as and expert but I’ve edited a ton of them and made my fair share (and made some really bad ones too). It all depends on what you are trying to achieve. You must have PS and at least one of the following, Crazybump or Ndo2 (there is a old one I picked up somewhere called normalmaperATI and the tga to dot3 option). There are also plugins for PS or gimp. You will have to learn to use them.There are tons of texture packs where people just run the base texture or even final texture through the filters and the normal maps looks like crap very grainy. Most of the programs run on value with light/white transferring to up and darker/black to down when run through the plugins/program, Biggest mistake people make is running a picture or texture through a filter with highlights and shadows that are really strong. Play with the contrast and exposure before running the texture. Also edit out all shadows and highlights from light sources on the picture. This is usually why photos of stainless steel look terrible. You will have to play with the value sliders to get a good image because it all depends on the effect you are trying to get. I end up editing the normal maps based on the viewers provided with CB and ndo. I also use Toolbag 1 and 2 for real time looks a what I just worked on.</p>

The uncut series is a different animal. We have discussed it with Chon. I played the ST one. It has some interesting ideas, but quality wise doesn’t match up to the free mod, much less the steam version. Since Chon is on the team now its a moot point about that community submission. Chon is also free to release any future versions with out our interference. The problem is money. If we make any on this then who ever got their stuff in would have to sign a waiver or contract stating that they were no going to get any compensation from their submission. Because if they didn’t I’m sure someone would sue down the road. As for community support on the paid version we should be announcing what all we plan on supporting at some point in the future. (I hope that was vague enough)</p>

<p>With good reason. Try clicking the “New Topic” button. It’s disabled. You literally cannot make a thread in that section. That’s why it is empty.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I would imagine now there is a comercial release that community assets are more for the free version the steam version is probably not addressed with that statement.</p>
<p>It is more than likely outdated but i guess it applies to the free version</p>

<p>Is there a way to get the vent textures their own files instead of just replacing existing textures outright? My mod will probably have quite a few vents in varying conditions, so having different textures for different areas would help alleviate visual monotony. (Also, if I wanted to use these in my mod, could I do that as long as I credit you?)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>what mr someguy said rename and put them in your metal materials folder.</p>
<p>yes you can use them let’s face it it’s not going to end up in the game proper, hardly any community assets have and I doubt that will change any time soon. I did not do it for that reason either to try and get my assets in to game I just don’t like the vent textures.</p>
<p>but if you do the renaming they won’t show up in Black Mesa.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get the vent textures their own files instead of just replacing existing textures outright? My mod will probably have quite a few vents in varying conditions, so having different textures for different areas would help alleviate visual monotony. (Also, if I wanted to use these in my mod, could I do that as long as I credit you?)</p>

</aside>
<p>If it’s your mod, renaming them should suffice. Just make sure you rename any associated files as well. So you’re rename the texture, rename the normal, rename the vmt, and open the vmt (with notepad) and change the paths to point at the new texture names. This will make them a separate texture, they will not replace anything and will not appear unless you place them in hammer.</p>
<p>Take</p>
<p>texture.vmt<br>
texture.vtf<br>
texture_normal.vtf</p>
<p>change to</p>
<p>renamed.vmt<br>
renamed.vtf<br>
renamed_normal.vtf</p>
<p>Then in the renamed.vmt, near the top you’ll find something like</p>
<p><code>	"$basetexture"	"metal\texture"
	"$surfaceprop"  "metal"
	"$bumpmap"	"metal\texture_normal"</code></p>
<p>Simply change those to the new name and save it.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I was actually planning on having a break from black mesa for a bit and started playing mirrors edge.</p>
<p>When i saw the vents in that game iknew black mesa needed something similar, so i ended up stopping playing mirrors edge to do this.</p>
<p>Ok slightly improved version available now in first post. Bump maps are a lot better.</p>
<p>this will be the last update for the pack but if somone thinks they can improve it further be my guest.</p>

            <p>I have sorted it out, I needed to make a props folder in BMS for the Path…</p>
<p>The game will always look in BMS files first, so I just had to create a path for it.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping.</p>
<p>I think the bump maps need improvement as I just used the default vtf edit generated bump maps… I am using gimp, does anyone have any knowledge of how to enhance the bump maps and keep the settings the same for all the textures?</p>
<p>or even if someone who is more talented than myself would like to do it I would be even happier  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I have made a high quality metal air duct / vent texture pack…I think the vent textures are a bit low res compared with the rest of Black mesa this gives the vents more detail. They are also bump mapped and shiny. the top image is out of date there is dirt on it now. It has taken me all day to do this but I am glad that I did.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the new looking vents that I have done</p>

<p>Download link V3 final.</p>

<p>Extract the <span class="bbcode-b">New</span> folder to your BMS directory and play through a level like office complex you will notice the difference straight away.</p>
<p>The old textures are also included to reverse the changes If you prefer the original look.</p>
<p>Enjoy</p>
