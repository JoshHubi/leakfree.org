    <description>What would you say to the haters of Half-Life 2? Come on. You know, the little kids who go around to some random forum first chance they get and haven&#39;t even played the game and rage about it! Tell everyone what you think of these &quot;people&quot;. :rage::freeman:

Something glitched below...No clue...


Oh, and don&#39;t forget whining about steam and how &quot;steam sucks&quot;. Steam has gotten shit tons better, I always liked it anyway. Easy as hell to use and connects people. The only tiny little thing I could possibly bitch about is the constant maintenance. But I am not an impatient fuck bag.</description>

<p>then when hl2 came out i beat it and the episodes. then years later i got hl1 and beat it. Hl2 was awesome till i beat the origional.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I beat the original first, liked both. I was hugely disappointed with there being no “big ass boss fight” like there was in HL1, but what can you do. Still up there in my game lists, I have about 100 hours on it alone.</p>
<p>EP1 annoyed me because it was too short I beat the puzzles easily. EP2 was a lot tougher because it was after I figured out how to increase the monster HP/damage to give me more of a challenge. As a result, a lot tougher, a lot longer, and more enjoyable. Even with the very crappy AI.</p>
<p>Over all there are a few things they could’ve improved, but only to an extent.<br>
I give it a 7/10 for gameplay, etc (first time around) after I ramped up the NPC health &amp; damage 9/10 it became a lot tougher and more fun as a result.</p>
<p>– topic</p>
<p>I say: “you ever played the game?”<br>
If yes: “Why?”<br>
If no: “Play it first.”<br>
After that, I’d just shrug and walk away.</p>
