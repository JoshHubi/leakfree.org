    <title>Community Games, Take 2 - Play with the Devs!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/community-games-take-2-play-with-the-devs/13562</link>
    <description>Remember back when I wanted to play some HL1 with the Black Mesa community, and we did a few games together? What wonderful days those were? What fun we had? Ah, it was beautiful. You don&#39;t? Oh. Well...I remembered you :&#39;(

I&#39;ve been having fun doing some more community things recently and gearing up for some future fun stuff, so I wanted to start doing this again. Basically, I quite feel like playing this game, called &quot;Half-Life&quot;. I don’t know if you know about it or not, but I heard from quite a reliable source that it’s quite an okay game. I’m not convinced, myself.

[b]Help convince me. On this Sunday (the 23rd Nov), at 10PM GMT/UTC (or 5PM EST), I want to put this groundbreaking theory to the test...with you, yes - YOU![/b]

During this time I will be hosting a Half-Life server on the East Coast (we find it&#39;s the best compromise for US and European pings), called [b][i]“Top Secret Public Official Unofficial Black Mesa Half-Life Server”.[/i][/b] The server will be free to join, limited to 24 players (not for lack of server space – but we don’t want total chaos!), and will be running a rotation of HL1’s stock maps (with the exact map dependant on the player count at the time). It will run, and we will be playing, until we feel like stopping! If you feel like playing, stop on by, join up, and play some Half-Life with us! I’ll try my best to be active and facilitate a nice gaming experience for all involved, and have a chat with you guys too. Sunday is our usual testing time, so there are bound to be a fair few devs around.

Just be prepared to get killed, shit talked, killed again, shit talked some more, and then killed once more. In the nicest way possible, that is. But seriously, we’re gonna have some fun. “Why do this?” you ask. The answer is, because I like video games. You should too. Let’s play some video games! I also think we have a pretty cool community, and I’d like to play some vidya with you guys.

[i]Disclaimer: This is all entirely off my own back, because I want to play some HL1 with our community. It shouldn’t be taken as a precedent, nor does it reflect anything the team is doing. I’m not sure precisely how many devs will be involved – but I certainly will be.[/i]</description>

<p>Things were said…which may or may not have been regretted…</p>
<p>Also, Morloc is absolutely lovely. JP and Jordan are just meanies, don’t listen to them!</p>
<p>Games were fun, gents. It also proved a very informative research session for our level design team; most of our MP level designers were present. Was good seeing all the familiar names and faces from the forums again! We also had a brief cameo from our new marine voice Mike Tsarouhas! What a guy!</p>
<p>We will have to do this again sometime. Would you guys like that? Might try and find some other good games to play with the community.</p>

            <p>I was only on for a short while and had loads of fun (if I sucked all the way through–at least I wasn’t in last… somehow) but had to leave early because I’m still getting over one of the worst colds I’ve had in years.  Wish I could’ve stayed longer.</p>
<p>Well, maybe we can do this again sometime?</p>
