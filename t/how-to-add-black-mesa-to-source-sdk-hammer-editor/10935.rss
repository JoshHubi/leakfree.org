    <title>How to add black mesa to source sdk hammer editor?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-add-black-mesa-to-source-sdk-hammer-editor/10935</link>
    <description>i have always wanted to do black mesa styled maps but the old stuff just wasn&#39;t legit enough, i only want to make maps and little in game mods 
now so far i have added black mesa to hammer and i can create brushes and all the right textures are there (i don&#39;t know about the entities ) ... the only problem is the 2d screens are missing the grids, but if i draw out a block and hit enter and then play with the camera i can see it but its impossible to map that way .... so the main question would be ... how could i copy and paste all of the mapping materials to another game so i could use them , or how could i properly set up black mesa for mapping ... again i don&#39;t intend to use these commercially i just wanna have fun with some maps for single player  :slight_smile:</description>
