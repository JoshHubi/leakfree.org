    <description>as you people already knew the news and saw the ending cinematic, the new LK is Bolvar Fordragon, and Arthas is Dead.


in my opinion the ending was great but the Death of Arthas is Kinda sad and disappointing.

            <p>as you people already knew the news and saw the ending cinematic, the new LK is Bolvar Fordragon, and Arthas is Dead.</p>
