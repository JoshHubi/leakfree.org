    <description>lately my GEFORCE 9600GT has been idling around the 57-59 celsius areas, where previously it would idle around 48-49 and that&#39;s been worrying me a bit. 
so, i just want to know at what temperature i should install a fire extinguisher next to my desk, thanks.</description>

            <p>Right, thanks for that. Went ingame, and found I get during average gameplay 4 frames per second. If I’m lucky, 5.</p>
<p>I don’t believe my graphics card is <em>that</em> bad…</p>

            <p>Thing is, I’ve only just had it replaced after… get this… the CPU, GPU and PSU were written off because they were <span class="bbcode-i">fried</span>. Used to hit 100, 110… Now tell ya what, even I know that ain’t healthy.</p>
<p>However, TF2 used to be playable on this machine. As was HL2 and other source games; and that was with decent settings. Right now I can’t even play it on minimum because of the performance. If there’s a command to show the fps in TF2 without having to run another program to get an overlay to do it, let me know so that I can tell you just how bad it is. It’s certainly below 30 on minimum. Best guess, below 10; maybe around 6.</p>

            <p>ouch those specs will only get you so far…</p>
<p>I think you’re getting normal performance in TF2 but your GPU temp could be lower, you should really consider a GPU upgrade.</p>

            <p>My GPU hits 80 when playing TF2… Would that explain why it runs so damn badly on min even though the recommended settings are fairly high? O_o</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Just getting some more data…</p>
<p>GPU (TF2) max: 78<br>
GPU Idle: ~67<br>
CPU Max: 73<br>
CPU Idle: ~55</p>
<p>Also recently developed a problem where the computer will freeze completely, (though it could be the video output freezing, no way I know to tell the difference), and requires a cold boot…</p>
<p>Booting now takes 8 minutes to get past the initial boot screen, (thus arriving at the Windows XP [loading bar] screen) for a total boot time of 10 minutes :fffuuu:</p>
<p>Still waiting for it to restart to tell you the specs and other useful info… (accidentally kicked it, which causes it to restart due to power failure… I think the power button wiring has come loose somewhere)</p>
<p>Moar Edit:</p>
<p>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 7300 SE/7200 GS, 512MB<br>
CPU: Intel Pentium 4, 3.40GHz, (2CPUs) ~Hyperthreaded?<br>
1024MB RAM</p>
<p>Anything else needed, I am happy to provide, just let me use my computer again :’(</p>

            <p>If your PSU fan(s) are spinning and the voltages are more or less where they should be you’re fine.</p>
<p>Anyway, it doesn’t have to be a heat issue but it’s still probably a GPU failure.</p>

            <p>i put a can of compressed air to the thing and dusted and cleaned most of my computer, now it’s idling at a toasty 58 degrees celsius. i don’t think that was the problem</p>
<p>is the heat noticeable by touch?</p>

            <p>By XP Mode he means the compatibility mode. Right click the program .exe and click properties, go to the compatibility tab, and there’s the “Run in” or something like that box and you can choose what OS compatibility to run the program in.</p>

            <p>it’s not a heating issue. If it was the computer would just shut itself down. Nothing is overheating. The computer doesn’t freeze. The games do, and I can minimize out of them and get back in. XP mode? My OS is Windows Vista 64-bit.</p>
<p>Yes, i’ve installed and uninstalled so many different drivers. Nothing works.</p>
<p>Even used Driver Sweeper</p>

            <p>get your hands on a copy of everest (i dont care how u get it) and post the lowest and highest temp of atleast your cpu and chipset. perhaps even your voltages. Other then that, i spose you could try running the game as admin + maybe even run in xp mode. Also check if your drivers are actually even installed (i know my mates 250gts kept having default drivers installed).</p>

            <p>It may very well just be a faulty card. That’d be my first guess if it’s a new card and you’re only getting up to 75 degrees.</p>

            <p>I think it’s safe to say that this is no heat issue of any kind. I have opened up the case. Set fan speed to 100. This did not work. So I got a small household fan, and put it infront of the open case, and turned it on full speed. My computer is COLD! Only way it could get any colder is if I put it in the fucking fridge! THIS DID NOT WORK. My video card was idling at 38-40 degrees and in-game only reached up to 60. I don’t know what to do. I’ve installed and uninstalled all sorts of drivers. Nothing works.</p>
<p>Also, this power supply is new. I got it just for the new card.</p>

            <p>I also have a 9600 gt, it was idling at around 68-72C, so I opened up the GPU, replaced the thermal paste, cleaned out the fan, and I also have my pc case open with a small fan aimed directly at the GPU, never goes over 54C.</p>

            <p>yeah i know what your saying, but its proberly best if we rule everything else out before going and saying</p>
<p>“oh shit bro, replace your video card and itll be sweet”</p>
<p>the only other thing related to video card that hasnt been stated yet is this.<br>
Try the normal nvidia drivers. (or the branded ones)</p>
<p>If that doesnt work, once again the temp’s would be nice. And while your at it, give us your voltages for good measure <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>So I played Batman: Arkham Asylym for about 2 hours today. It only froze twice during that time. But I was able to ctr alt delete (minimize) and get back into it as if nothing had happened within a few seconds.</p>
<p>I think that something is overheating and causing minor freezing. But I don’t think it’s the video card.</p>

<p>I have been having similar problems. Even though my comp idles at 49 degrees. Whenever I play L4D2 it’ll eventually freeze around 70-75 degrees. The game freezes in a constant sound loop. I’m able to minimize and get back into it, don’t have to restart the computer. But it just wont stop freezing…</p>
<p>The card I use is a Nvidia GeForce EVGA GTX 275. It’s a new card, and it seems to give off a lot of heat. I’ve reinstalled my drivers and everything. Same problem. If around 70 is a decent temperature, then I don’t get why L4D2 is freezing. Oh yeah, same problem with TF2. Except it doesn’t happen as quickly or often with TF2.</p>

<p>ASUS motherboards sometimes put the back-to-back CAS delay for memory to zero which causes the system to lock up randomly no matter how much it’s under load with a looping sound. 75 C on the GPU shouldn’t lock up your computer, chipset overheating could be the problem as they are often positioned behind the videocard. Idle chipset is 40 C, 30 C ideal. Try not to go past 60 C which is known to cause stability issues.</p>
<p>If your motherboard heats up when the videocard is under stress then you might want to consider moving the graphics card a slot up or down depending on what motherboard you have to give the chipset some more room.</p>

            <p>I haven’t even opened my computer since I bought it 2 years ago. My temperatures are OKAY I guess</p>

            <p>Hm. Lets see here. Well, it’s an HP Pavilion. Processor: Intel® Core™2 Quad CPU Q9650 @ 3.00 GHz 3.00 GHz</p>
<p>memory 6.00 GB</p>
<p>System Type:  64-bit Operating System. Windows Vista.</p>
<p>Those temps I mentioned before are from my graphics card (GTX 275). I have this software that tells me my cards GPU temps and adjust my fan speed. I’m not really sure how to check my temps for all that other stuff.</p>
<p>I did a memory diagnostics test and it looks like it passed. No errors were found. So far this has only happened on TF2 and L4D2. I haven’t tried any other games yet. Just re-formated recently and I do have the latest drivers. Even reinstalled them one time. Still nothin’.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also I should mention that it’s not my comp that freezes. Just the game. It just freezes on a sound loop. I can still minimize and then maximize again and still be in the game. But yeah, no restart on the computer required.</p>

<p>judging from experience, i wouldnt start pointing fingers at your gpu. 75 is fine. check all your other temps, (cpu, chipset). If my computer suddenly froze, i would either be playing sacred 2 or my cpu just overheated (time to clean the zalman lol)</p>
<p>post your system specs and include all your temps right before the freeze. That way we can rule out your temp’s. Would also be handy to know your OS.</p>
<p>And cheer up grum, atleast your spare rig doesnt OC itself when you launch a game. its like a crappy athlon 4600+ x2. Open up css and view the cpu speed, it says like 4.5ghz, to achieve that speed im guessing it throttles something back because it doesnt overheat :\</p>
