    <description>Anyone seen this yet?

[url]https://www.mapmodnews.com/article.php/Forced-kil-civilians-Modern-Warfare-2[/url]

It&#39;s footage (confirmed by Activision to be 100% genuine) that consists of the player, and other armed terrorists, gunning down civilians and security personnel at an Airport. Two things to note: there is a Game Over screen if you, the player, kill an innocent (as seen in the above video), and Infinity Ward have included a warning before this particular section allowing you to skip it entirely.

So, what do you think?</description>

            <p>Apparently the scene isn’t offensive; its just part of the unnecessarily over the top storyline of the game. Or, at least, that’s what the Good Game guys said  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> .</p>

<p>Some of those bodies appeared to be lying there since before you got there, obviously preplaced, but there’s no way they could’ve shot so many of them so quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thats more of an engine limmitation. All the bodies slow the game down, so they are preplaced for the sake of performance.</p>

            <p>Not really. Most of the people outraged at these things are liberals, which is why I’m always surprised Fox is the only one to jump on IW for this. Also, while the Mass Effect thing was stupid, this has substance. You massacre an airport full of freakin’ civilians! They have the right to get outraged at that.</p>

            <p>in my opinion if it was JUST the developers choice it would not be an option to skip… I think that would more likely be something brought up by the publisher or some head in a meeting saying “I dunno… what if someone gets their feelings hurt?”…</p>
<p>anyway, I think it would be more for shock value in a… non-serious game (like GTA, or Uncharted 2, or something) there I could see it out of place or overkill (forgive the pun), but here. here it fit. it is integral to what follows and is in a more serious setting.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=‘Red’]ETA</span>: THANK YOU, RabidMonkey, for discussing it and stating your opinion with a noob (been here all along though, and had an account before the ‘big crash’) instead of just saying “you disagree with me so you are wrong”.</p>
<p>… which, ironically, I did on the one point. :retard:</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">ETA2</span>: I also find it ironic and hilarious that this has forum has a ‘non-pc’ smiley called “retard”</p>

            <p>That was actually a point I made in chat and forgot to mention here. From one angle it is a successful sequence because it evokes emotion, but I think they could have pulled strings with a less shocking scene; IMO depicting the mass slaughter of innocent people is tasteless no matter how you look at it. It’s kind of a cheap trick; it’s shock value.</p>
<p>You’re right, the option is there for the sake of political correctness…but if a developer strongly believes that a controversial scene is necessary as part of their storyline then they should integrate it with the main campaign and stand behind their decision, political correctness be damned. If they have to place a menu option to ask players if they want to see it or not (noting that it has no bearing on the campaign), it seems to me more like an unnecessary extra (unless publisher stipulations made them place the option there; which wouldn’t really surprise me either, and in which case my previous statement is null and void  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>

            <p>I say that, without this scene, the storytelling of the single player campaign would be less immersive. THAT part alone makes you think\feel and with that it helps aspects of the rest of the game have real reason. Real emotion.</p>
<p>That shock? That pain? means IW DID THEIR JOBS. Like mentioned by someone before entertainment doesn’t necessarily mean “holy shit! that was fun!” or “this is exciting!” or some such… there are more emotions than that and a good movie/game/book can hit several of them like this game did.<br>
… in my opinion it comes down to one thing… Feelings.<br>
my wife hates horror movies (not just gory ones… those she just thinks are stupid) she doesn’t like the feeling of being scared.<br>
I have friends that don’t like chick flicks (although I don’t like horrible ones) they  don’t like anything that brings up romance\lovey dovey crap.<br>
The people who are disturbed by this don’t want that feeling in their gut of “holy shit… what did I just do?!?” or (what I felt at the time) “would this be worth the cost no matter who we are ‘taking down’ or what other atrocities we are preventing?” (which, in this case, was moot point anyways since they know you aren’t one of them).<br>
but I also think others should be entitled to their opinions…</p>
<p>my only disagreement:</p>

            <p>A bit of a bump to this thread, but I just played this level and was going on a bit of a rant in the steam chat about it. This is what I thought;</p>
<p>I’m all for developers pushing the envelope, doing new and awesome things, and being very edgy (and sometimes, controversial). In my opinion though, this level does none of those things, aside from being controversial.</p>
<p>I am glad that IW chose to put in an option to skip this level from the get-go when you first start the game; but that also made me think - if you have to prompt players whether they want to play a level or not due to content when they first start the game, is it <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> necessary to include it in the first place? If this option is given then it’s obviously not integral to the core storyline of the game. I realize that choosing to play this one particular (short) section of the game was entirely at my own will and that I had the option to skip it but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and considering the storyline is pretty short as it stands, I want to get my full $60 worth. Also, being involved in aviation (albeit non commercial) this particular level hit pretty close to home for me.</p>
<p>I knew what was coming, and I was still pretty shocked. Watching my cohorts mow down everyone in sight, leaving a few stragglers barely alive to scream in pain and try to crawl away, leaving trails of blood, was very painful to watch, and not entertaining in the slightest. I was enjoying the single-player portion of the game until I hit this portion. At which point I was too disgusted to continue.</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to say I’m not easily offended…but this sure did it for me. IMO it was completely unnecessary and over the top. I think IW could have done something much more clever and groundbreaking instead. (Yes, killing civilians in video games has been done before, and it’s tasteless every time, no matter what engine it’s being rendered in, or what location they place you in to do it.) Hell, they could have placed part of it in a cutscene and it wouldn’t have bothered me as much. Lots of movies are violent too, but you’re not interacting with and directly controlling them; it’s a completely different ballgame.</p>

            <p>Actually, OP made me check this game out. And I thought I gave up with gaming completely.<br>
Killing civilians was actually thrilling. And fun.<br>
Props to Infinity Ward for having balls.</p>
<p>EDIT: and actually, it’s a very interesting point here brought by devs, because it raises the question: How much is too much?<br>
The mission pretty much shows that nothing is too much.</p>
