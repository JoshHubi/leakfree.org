    <title>THQ Goes Bankrupt</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/thq-goes-bankrupt/12028</link>
    <description>Been a long time since I&#39;ve posted on the forum, but I figure this is big enough news to say something.

THQ declared bankruptcy yesterday, and as of that, both Volition, and 4A Games were sold to Deep Silver/Koch Entertainment; as well as Relic Entertainment being sold to SEGA. Platinum Games is also looking to buy Vigil Games, so it looks like most of the games will live on, but it sucks to see all this happen.</description>

            <p>That’s what I’m hoping. And the physical version on Amazon is the cheapest. The game uses Steamworks, do you know if they’ll email me the code or would I have to wait for the shipment?</p>

            <p>So since the publishing rights for Metro Last Light were sold to Deep Silver, how does this affect the game? I want to preorder but I’m not sure if this whole thing changed the game in any way from what it originally would have been.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Someone can correct me if I’m wrong but I’d assume Relic still holds the Warhammer rights for a set time in a contract with Games Workshop. This would be true regardless of who Relic are owned by.</p>
<p>Once this is through GW can either set up a new one or not, or cancel the contract with some kind of forfeit to Relic or if Relic are deemed to be ‘wasting their time and money’.</p>
<p>That’s what I assume anyway.</p>
<p>With Relic in tow SEGA could really punch a major hole into the strategy market. Company of Heroes, Homeworld and the rights to Warhammer, along with CAs Total series seems to me like a fool proof combination.</p>
<p>Now I’ve said that expect every single one of those series to get buried under a mountain of rushed, poorly tested games! YAY!</p>

<p>So Relic have gone to Sega?</p>
<p>Who got the WH40k rights?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sega got all of Relic’s franchises in the deal, including Dawn of War. I’m not sure if this includes exclusive rights to Warhammer 40k, though it is interesting to note that Sega has teams working on Warhammer fantasy material already (including the drool-inducing prospect of Creative Assembly developing a Total Warhammer). I’m sure they’d love to have Games Workshop’s entire oevre in-house.</p>

<p>Who got the WH40k rights?<br>
And on that note, Dark Millenium 40k is totally scrapped.  THQ said it was going to be made into a single player (rather than the intended MMO), but apparently all the staff were sacked weeks before that announcement was made and nothing has happened to the project since.</p>

            <p>THQ have made some pretty piss poor decisions in recent years, not to say this bankruptcy isn’t sad.</p>
<p>But really, they have churned out some shit products at times, and their main sellers never get enough advertising. The only recent game of theirs I remember getting decent attention was Saints Row 3, and that was pretty lackluster in comparison to the second.</p>
<p>I think people expect to be able to throw out anything and make a profit, which clearly isn’t the case.</p>
<p>Sad to see their subsidiaries go to others, especially SEGA. SEGA haven’t put out a decent game in years, although recent acquisitions might change that I suppose.</p>

            <p>Still, something like that shouldn’t be DLC</p>

            <p>It would have become DLC later. Ranger mode in Metro 2033 was DLC as well.</p>

            <p>It’s too bad, but they still made pretty stupid decisions before they closed a little after the bundle, like forcing people to get the LE of metro last light to have access to ranger difficulty.</p>

            <p>Yeah, seems like the Humble THQ Bundle was a last-ditch effort to bring in some money so they wouldn’t have to declare bankruptcy, with their CEO buying it for $11,000 and it wasn’t enough.</p>

            <p>Now we know why they decided to give away all their games for nothing.</p>

            <p>Been a long time since I’ve posted on the forum, but I figure this is big enough news to say something.</p>
<p>THQ declared bankruptcy yesterday, and as of that, both Volition, and 4A Games were sold to Deep Silver/Koch Entertainment; as well as Relic Entertainment being sold to SEGA. Platinum Games is also looking to buy Vigil Games, so it looks like most of the games will live on, but it sucks to see all this happen.</p>
