    <description>It makes you look like a fool.

Halo is an alright franchise, just heavily overrated.

Modern Warfare 2 ain&#39;t too bad either, once again, just heavily overrated.

Mac is a capable and legitimate gaming platform, deal with it.

FPS on consoles don&#39;t work too bad either, the problem is companies ignoring the necessities of the average PC gamer with lousy ports.

Anyone care to go on?</description>

            <p>Well said taxi_evil. If you become emotionally attached to a certain brand or franchise, it just means that their marketing schemes were successful in being able to lure your easily suggestible mind into “joining” their “side”.</p>
<p>After that, it starts a “us vs them” mentality that is completely illogical and only further cements your status as a gullible fool who feels the need to belong to an abstract group that requires fierce defense from attacks from the other “sides”.</p>
<p>In reality it all boils down to a bunch of guys like you just throwing words at each other while the fat suits from the companies you so much adore drink bourbon with each other and laugh on their costumers’ face while still doing whatever they can in their power to take your money.</p>

            <p>This thread is slowly becoming more ironic. I need to find a fake moustache, twiddle it and comment on the irony while sipping fine port</p>
<p>Anyway…</p>
<p>I really don’t see why people ally themselves to one brand so completely. It’s a huge corporation that doesn’t notice if you spend your money there or not, but some people will still pour thousands of pounds into their coffers and viciously attack anyone who doesn’t like them. If you look at each product that comes along objectively, and find what suits your needs, you’re far less likely to waste your money.</p>
<p>I had a PS2, which gave me many happy years of gaming. I then moved to an Xbox 360 because it was cheaper, suiting my needs better. Am I happy? Yes. Have Sony written tearful letters to me? No. Do I attack everyone who decided to get a PS3? No, because I’m not 12 years old.</p>
<p>Maybe not the best example, but you could apply the same thing to the Mac argument. If they’re happy to buy a Mac, and enjoy using it, who really gives a damn? Nobody’s saying you need to buy one. I don’t go next door and have an argument with my neighbour because he doesn’t drive a Renault and I do…</p>

<p>There’s your problem. You fail to understand that Mac Pro is a purpose-built workstation designed for specific tasks. It’s not your everyday gaming rig built from separate parts.</p>
<p>Just show me another mass production workstation that has a motherboard that is able to run two single-die 6-core xeons. These are supercomputer motherboards which cost 1,5-3k new and 1k refurbished. And 3k is not that expensive, mind you:<br>

<p>Oh and when it was just released, entry level quad core <span class="bbcode-i">xeon</span> costed about 1000-1200k. Current gen westmere CPU’s:<br>

<p>I can go on and on, but the only problem it sorta used to have is the lacklustre graphics card. But rendering relies more on CPU clock speed and number of processing threads rather than a video card. This 3d accelerator was include solely for the purpose of having one. Otherwise you wouldn’t be able to output a picture. This, plus you could play games on it as an extra, despite it was designed primarily as a workstation. And then again, you can easily buy a dedicated nvidia Quaddro FX built specifically for mac.<br>
Oh, key word there - <span class="bbcode-i">specifically</span>. The whole hardware package is <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">optimized</span></span> for heavy duty rendering/server hosting on MacOS platform. They squeeze every bit of the hardware in every new model. This goes for every Mac computer. You cannot do this trick on Windows based platforms for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Conclusion - gaymers shold not express their opinions on purpose-built workstations. Low-end users cannot really fathom the power behind this type of machines. There is a reason why it is called pro.</p>

            <p>How exactly are they a moron? They proved that Macs are far more expensive than the sum of its parts. Which, while true for pretty much any pre-assembled computer, is amplified with Apple, it seems, because Apple computers tend to be extremely expensive.</p>

<p>I think your confusing fanboys with haters.  I am a fanboy and damn proud of it.  I love Half-Life and am willing to admit I know more about it than I should.  A fanboy is just a fan of something to an extreme.  It does not inherently mean that they hate the other counterpart.  What I am trying to say is fanboy is a considered a positive, they enjoy something a lot not hate something a lot.</p>
<p>So to this thread I would like to say<br>

            <p>No one will realize that untill they end up fucking themselves over somehow through blind fanboyism. Or at least missing out on something, then getting into it late, then realizing a past mistake. But it can go both ways. Some people try so hard NOT to be a fanboy they end up forcing themselves to enjoy things they subconsciously don’t and inadvertently become a fake fanboy who defends that thing they don’t REALLY like. Most of my friends who play MW2 (or Halo or gears or anything like that) religiously don’t actually like it. I can hear it in their voices and see it in their expressions. But they won’t admit it.</p>

            <p>The OP made think that the point of this thread was more of, don’t have an opinion or make consumer decisions you’re a fanboy.</p>
<p>There is a reason why there are Halo fanboys who praise it like no tomorrow and anti-fanboys(?) who hate it.  There are valid arguments.  Taking the middle ground is just being an indecisive bitch, as a consumer your goal is to use reason to make choices.  Obviously your going to get invested in your decision you invested money into it already.  Someone saying you made the wrong decision is something no one ever takes well.</p>

            <p>I understand what you’re saying but that’s not really the point here. One can easily spend as much or more than a Mac on a monster of a gaming PC. How much money are you willing to spend to get your gaming on is irrelevant here. It’s a valid point, sure, but not for this thread.</p>
<p>The core of this discussion is that whatever you choose to play games on and which games you play on it, you shouldn’t be judged for that nor should you become so emotionally invested in it that you perceive people choosing other system and games as being deeply wrong decisions and that they should be berated for that. Or that those other systems or games have no good merits of their own and only what you like are the right things.</p>
