Just because I know a topic about it will show up sooner or later. I&#39;m disappointed, but not at all surprised.</description>

</aside>
<p>Why don’t they make steam sales public? I’m sure they are staggering. They could use those figures to impress game developers looking at steam and to show off to customers. Oh and shut up all the idiots who say pc gaming will die out.</p>

            <p>I know. I meant the Orange Box and the L4D games which have sold over 3-4 million times, without steam sales, cause Valve never makes them public.</p>

<p>Actually, Valve isn’t a tiny company. They have over 265 employees, and they work on games which sell over 2-5 million copies.</p>
<p>They are doing Dota 2 now, because it’s set to be released this year, while Half Life or another L4D have no release dates yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like how you presume yourself to be the huge valve information center, when that information is incorrect and the information concerning E3 was largely incorrect. Those 2-5 million copies (If you’re just basing that off of Half-Life 2 sales) are only from physical copies, not concerning steam sales of the games.</p>

            <p>just read this:<br>
“every Valve employee is equal to like 3 regular employees”<br>
and lol’d<br>
i just played ep2s commentary mode for the first time and i think that the statement above<br>
includes an unerestimating regular employee/valve employee ratio,<br>
which i think is rather  &gt;9000 to 1.</p>

            <p>Actually, Valve isn’t a tiny company. They have over 265 employees, and they work on games which sell over 2-5 million copies.</p>
<p>They are doing Dota 2 now, because it’s set to be released this year, while Half Life or another L4D have no release dates yet.</p>

            <p>people were disappointed because the surprise was a surprise most people didn’t cared about. I don’t know many PS3 hardcore gamers who love Valve games. They are in a tiny tiny minority. Newsflash: Valve is a pretty tiny company in the world of gaming. They got to step up their game if they wanna be noticed. And they can’t ride the HL1/HL2 wave for years and years. Dota 2 is a new thing coming from Valve and I think they are doing this now because they know most people don’t give a shit about Gordon freeman and the Left 4 Dead games were soon forgotten.</p>

</aside>
<p>That just happened because no one can read :facepalm:</p>
<p>Doug Lombardi said that it’s going to be a Portal 2 related surprise instead of the big show. And what did the magazines do? They said they would show Source Engine 2 or Half Life 3 or Counter Strike 2, just because they can’t fucking read correctly.</p>
<p>Everyone who believed that it was going to be Half Life related must be completely retarded. Everyone is self responsible for being disappointed. I wasn’t, cause I’ve read what he said, and it had to do something with Portal 2. And ta-da. Portal 2 on PS3.</p>
