    <title>360 Controller Button Mod</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/360-controller-button-mod/6650</link>
    <description>So after a few weeks I have had enough and today I modded my 360 controller.

I&#39;m you are all well aware there are more buttons on a controller then when have fingers to push them all.

And instead of practicing finger yoga everyday I decided to mod my 360 controller so that I have a duplicate of the &#39;X&#39; and &#39;B&#39; buttons on the under side of the controller.

Becuase when I play halo I use bumper jumper button config that leaves my utility button as &#39;X&#39; which is annoying if I want to use the jectpack or something I need to all the time, because I either have my thumb on the stick, or I have it pushing the button, and I duplicated &#39;B&#39; as well because I just wanted to make things easier since it was reload and would allow me to do so without taking my thumb off the right stick.

I took photo&#39;s along the way but they are a bit blurry because at the time, I didn&#39;t care enough to check to see if they came out fine. I plan to mod another one later on in the week or the weekend and for that one I will video log it for YT.

Anyway, after pulling the controller apart, which was hilarious, because Microsoft care so much about protecting their controller from, whoever, they use torx8 security screws, funny thing is, they are that small you can snap the middle stub off with a regular flat head screw driver and unscrew them with a regular torx8 driver, anyway, after that I cut 2 holes for the buttons I got from Jaycay.

After that I soldered the wire onto the buttons to check the length, the whole way through this I kept testing the buttons to see if they were still working on the XBLM.

The super awesome workbench, since I don&#39;t have a desk I don&#39;t care about or a woodem plank to cover my current ones, I had to work outside, and today it was hot enough without having to use a 300 C soldering iron.

[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1282104/DSCF0092.JPG[/img]

next came the part where I needed to scrap off the epoxy from the PCB so that I could solder the wire to it. &#39;S&#39; marks the signal side of the button and the &#39;G&#39; is the ground.

Care was needed, as well as a good view, picked up the helping hands today from Dick Smith for $10 and it came with the magnifying glass which was awesome.

Wires ready to be soldered onto the PCB after spending an hour carefully scraping the epoxy off and then boring out the holes with a safety pin and a thread of copper.

[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1282104/DSCF0096.JPG[/img]

And hey presto, it&#39;s finished, took a bit of effort to get the controller back together, but I worked out if I sticky tape the buttons from the top, to the top half of the controller it makes it a thousand times easier to put it back together.

EXTREME CLOSEUP

So yeah, thats what I did today, I&#39;m yet to play a single game, I only briefly tested it in campaign to check it went ok.</description>

            <p>Col, nice mod.  I’m a bit surprised that you have a 360, considering you were so die-hard Sony a few years back  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>You have inspired me to try the mod I’ve been thinking about for about 6 months.  A switch (or something) to swap the left and right triggers.  Because San Andreas was Deal of the Week and I couldn’t pass it up, but why the hell is aim on the right trigger and shoot on the left?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>It’s not worth it.</p>
<p>It cuts out at the end because I stopped paying attention to the time trying to find the diode I broke.</p>
<p>And looking over it, it wouldn’t make a very interesting vid.</p>
<p>I’ll get another preowned controller and try again soon and do a vid for that.</p>

            <p>No, just the ‘feel’ of the button.</p>
<p>At first it was a bit sketchy, I wasn’t pushing it hard enough and when using it when I have to hold it down, it would go on and off, but after a couple of days I’ve got it right and my hands have adjusted to having the buttons there.</p>
<p>Also, disaster.</p>
<p>Was modding the 2nd controller yesterday for the timelapse video and while doing it I clipped a diode and now 1/2 the buttons don’t work, so the controller is bscly bricked.</p>

            <p>You should look into seeing whether a third-party controller manufacturer would be interested in making similar ones with buttons on the back for people with RSIs. Nice work any way, I’d try that myself if my hands were steady enough to be able to do it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So after a few weeks I have had enough and today I modded my 360 controller.</p>
<p>I’m you are all well aware there are more buttons on a controller then when have fingers to push them all.</p>
<p>And instead of practicing finger yoga everyday I decided to mod my 360 controller so that I have a duplicate of the ‘X’ and ‘B’ buttons on the under side of the controller.</p>
<p>Becuase when I play halo I use bumper jumper button config that leaves my utility button as ‘X’ which is annoying if I want to use the jectpack or something I need to all the time, because I either have my thumb on the stick, or I have it pushing the button, and I duplicated ‘B’ as well because I just wanted to make things easier since it was reload and would allow me to do so without taking my thumb off the right stick.</p>
<p>I took photo’s along the way but they are a bit blurry because at the time, I didn’t care enough to check to see if they came out fine. I plan to mod another one later on in the week or the weekend and for that one I will video log it for YT.</p>
<p>Anyway, after pulling the controller apart, which was hilarious, because Microsoft care so much about protecting their controller from, whoever, they use torx8 security screws, funny thing is, they are that small you can snap the middle stub off with a regular flat head screw driver and unscrew them with a regular torx8 driver, anyway, after that I cut 2 holes for the buttons I got from Jaycay.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>After that I soldered the wire onto the buttons to check the length, the whole way through this I kept testing the buttons to see if they were still working on the XBLM.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>The super awesome workbench, since I don’t have a desk I don’t care about or a woodem plank to cover my current ones, I had to work outside, and today it was hot enough without having to use a 300 C soldering iron.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>next came the part where I needed to scrap off the epoxy from the PCB so that I could solder the wire to it. ‘S’ marks the signal side of the button and the ‘G’ is the ground.</p>
