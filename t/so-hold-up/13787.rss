    <description>You expect me to pay $20.00 for an unfinished remake of a game, which you&#39;ve already released for free, all of which that you released exclusively on a DRM platform?

I&#39;m no fool.</description>

            <p>To be blunt, the reason we are going in circles is because you keep bringing up the same arguments. Like I said eariler, you’ve made your point.</p>

<p>No, the mod is still free. The game is not, and never would be, free. Please find me proof that says they ever claimed that Black Mesa (the game), rather than Black Mesa (the mod) would be free.</p>
<p>Similarly, Counter Strike (the mod) was always free. CS:S and CS:GO are not.</p>

<p>Shinebox, I believe you have made your point.  The free mod Black Mesa still exists and you are welcome to play it.  If you want to have an updated game experience, want to go to Xen or simply want to support the developers, you have the choice of paying for it.  It’s that simple.  Like the man says, “It’s time to choose.”</p>

<p>So I can get an incomplete mod that took years to make, or I can pay $20 dollars and get what the devs were going to release for free.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh wait. EVENTUALLY get. It’s not even done yet.</p>

<p>You would be willing to pay 60 dollars for an unfinished remake of a 16-year old game?</p>

            <p>The two won’t be exactly the same. The paid version has new models and textures made by Bkdale and other members of the team. The free version would be just bug fixes. I’m not entirely sure if it’s upgraded to the new engine or not though.</p>

<p>They technically can do both, but it would be detrimental to the project.Having a job outside Black Mesa would minimize time able to be put into it, modelling, texturing, coding, mapping, etc.<br>
But if their job IS Black Mesa, then they’re making enough money to sustain themselves <span class="bbcode-i">and </span>the project, along with being able to put as much time into what they do as they need or want! It’s a win-win situation.</p>

<p>I agree, though you shouldn’t generalize not paying for the game as simply not <span class="bbcode-i">wanting</span> to. There are countless people out there who just plain can’t spare $19.99/£14.99. I’m in that exact situation.</p>
<p>If the free version gets updated, I’ll personally be torn between playing the free version, and waiting until I can buy the Steam version to play. But regardless, when I <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> get the Steam version, you bet your sweet Black Mesa behind I will!</p>

<p>They technically can do both, but it would be detrimental to the project.<br>
Having a job outside Black Mesa would minimize time able to be put into it, modelling, texturing, coding, mapping, etc.<br>
But if their job IS Black Mesa, then they’re making enough money to sustain themselves <span class="bbcode-i">and </span>the project, along with being able to put as much time into what they do as they need or want! It’s a win-win situation.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, it is a valid argument in this case.<br>
For years, the Black Mesa team has done nothing but give, and give, and give, and they’ve poured their lives into this project so you can enjoy it.<br>
It’s been in development for so long because the team is striving to make Black Mesa the best experience they possibly can. For your enjoyment.<br>
They’ve released an updated version of what we’ve had and loved for a long time now, because their community asked for more. We asked for more, and they provided.<br>
And the moment that they ask for even the slightest bit in return, you spit in their faces and refuse.<br>
Tell me, where the hell do you get off? What right have you to tell the Black Mesa team that they can’t even get the slightest bit of monetary help from their community?<br>
Donations almost never work. People won’t give other people money unless they get something in return. And I think $20 is a goddamn deal compared to the amount of work put into the game.</p>

            <p>You’re hardly making your own point. Releasing a half-baked product in bad taste, yes, but there is all the proper disclaimers in place and “EARLY ACCESS GAME” in big bold letters before the buy button, and frankly, this game isn’t half-baked. It’s fully baked with the other loaf of bread (that being Xen) in the oven cooking.</p>
<p>Do you have ANY idea how hard it is to make a good model, level, etc from scratch? They’re not making a 1:1 remake of Half-Life.</p>
