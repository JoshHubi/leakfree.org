    <description>I&#39;m getting a new video card for my low profile computer. Do I get the Radeon 2400 XT or the GeForce FX5200? My current video card sucks.</description>

            <p>FYI you can play Left 4 Dead on a lucky FX5200 that can overclock more than 150mhz over the stock frequency, I had one like that and it was pretty damn fast, around the speed of a geforce 6200.</p>

            <p>Personally id say go with the Geforce G210. It’s also low profile, but it packs quite a bit of bang for your buck. Also, very cheap, it’d be rare to find one for over $50. I’m using one currently and I run L4D very nicely on mostly high settings. I used to have the FX 5200, and it blew up. Seriously. I tried to play l4d on it and instead I got a bunch of oversized polygons of multicolors to which my computer crashed and would no longer display graphics. A removal of the card showed that three of the transistors had blow and the GPU had overheated. Stay far, far away. Especially because you can’t get a resolution above 1024x768. Pathetic.</p>

            <p>Look i’m not really into computers so I don’t know much. I got the 4650 and it works. This wasn’t the first place I went for help and I am not “trolling”. I just wanted to know which card can replace my current one.<br>
EDIT: LOCK THREAD. PROBLEM SOLVED.</p>

            <p>Lol. If he knew how to google he wouldn’t be asking stupid questions.</p>
<p>Sorry “Gay Zombie”, but asking if you should get an FX5200 a few days before 2010 rolls over is right up there with asking what kind of tape stores computer data the best, or what kind of rock is best for hammering your family portrait into your cave wall.</p>

<p>C’mon. The guy was considering buying an FX5200. He clearly has no idea what cards are around, what they can do, or what the requirements are. He doesn’t even seem to know enough to know what else to ask about. If it’s not a troll thread he’s gonna need all the help he can get. Including advice on not frying his card with static just by touching it.</p>

<p>Left 4 Dead is easy to run. The FX 5200 won’t run it at all, get the 4650, or the 4850 if you want a little more future proofing.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>How about checking what kind of GFX slot and available power he has before suggesting stuff.</p>
<p>OP - do you have an AGP or PCI-e slot for graphics? Do you even know what those are? Does your case have enough physical room for a modern GFX card? Also make sure your PSU is both powerful enough AND has the required cables.</p>
<p>Or course, none of this will really help without knowing what type of CPU/RAM etc you have too - if those are really old and shit, then adding a better GFX card won’t help at all, as they’ll just bottle-neck your system.</p>
<p>If your PC is old, you’ll just have to suck it up and buy / build a more modern one. PC gaming and keeping up with it can get expensive, and you’ll have to deal with that. As you’re discovering, it only takes a few short years and your PC won’t even play newer games.</p>
<p>Having said all that, the OP seems to be a troll post, as no-one is stupid enough to be asking about buying an FX5200 in this day and age, unless he expects us to believe he’s ordering from a four year old magazine. They don’t even make those old GFX card models anymore.</p>

            <p>Alright, but in case he goes for a different card or the 9600 (no idea what its requirements are) I wouldn’t want him to order a card only to find that there’s no way to connect it to his PSU, or worse, that he connects it and his computer fails to start due to inadequate power.</p>
<p>That is, if any decent GFX card will even fit inside his PC. lol</p>

            <p>4650s don’t need power cables, and pretty much any decent psu will give you enough juice through the rail. 4650s really aren’t that demanding.</p>

            <p>I’m shocked nobody mentioned to check the voltage on the rails.</p>
<p>If your current PSU supplies enough watts, it doesn’t necessarily mean that your video card will go with it. Check if it has the necessary 6pin/8pin connector(s), and if it has enough volts on the rails.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t, you can forget about buying a new GFX card. You would need to upgrade your entire PC (in most cases, the power supply and MB of Dell PCs are proprietary, and upgradability is limited at best.</p>
<p>Really be careful when it comes to upgrading OEM PCs. Once you spend the money, its often too late to go back.</p>

            <p>Umm, what?</p>
<p>Power supply’s are generally one universal size these days unless it’s a server or something. Is your computer 6 years old or something? Because if so, video card probably shouldn’t be your first upgrade.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Ohhh, it’s a slim computer. Well, you’ve kind of narrowed your opportunities for upgrading by buying a pc with such a small case. I haven’t looked into this, but I’m guessing some newer cards wouldn’t even fit into there.</p>

EDIT: My computer can’t even hold a 300 watt power box. I’m gonna need to cut a hole for this.</p>

            <p>But that includes CPU, ram, etc, plus wiggle room. Since he has a low-profile machine, the rest of his machine is probably pretty low power.</p>
