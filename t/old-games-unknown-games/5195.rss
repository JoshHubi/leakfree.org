    <title>Old Games - Unknown games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/old-games-unknown-games/5195</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, i figured I&#39;d start this thread because there just are so many topics on new games, why not reminisce and think about old classic games. Specifically what i had in mind is games that are classic to you, but not necessarily widely known. 

We all know the classics like quake and doom, unreal, wolfenstein, descent etc. love em or hate em, they are all widely known for many reasons. 

I&#39;ll start by naming a couple of mine and giving pictures.

Daggerfall:
(not necessarily unknown, but still not as known as other classics)
I list daggerfall even though it is new to me (i just played it within the past 2 years) because of the game itself. It offers so much to the player, and it doesn&#39;t hold your hand. It lets you be who you want, and go wherever you want. It has very nice atmosphere as well for an added bonus, and while some people think the game is all just size, that&#39;s not the case - you can tell the developers put a lot of care into the game, and it has become my favorite ES game.

Terminator: Future shock (+ skynet)
This is one i haven&#39;t played in years, and even though it wasn&#39;t a favorite game way back when i played it first, i see now something about it while i am replaying it that makes me like it a lot. 

Set in the terminator universe in the future briefly shown in the films, It was the first fully 3d fps game, before quake 1, and it even had vehicle segments where you could drive jeeps, and fly gunships. The vehicles even handle much like games now, making it somewhat weird going back and playing it, seeing as how much it feels like other games. 

It had nice atmosphere (it did a good job of capturing the feel of the first movie) and dark music, and it introduced something that ID picked up after seeing it as a good move - mouse look and control. This allowed people to use the vehicles with ease, rotating the turret and shooting with the mouse, while driving with the keyboard - as well as made aiming easier and has become a standard for any and ever PC fps game. The game itself is very sandbox like and open ended, and exploration is rewarded. You can enter almost every building, and the levels are massive. Another feature that was overlooked by many games until later was the destructibility. In this game the environment could work to your advantage. You could blow up any car or truck you see, and break into any container to look for ammo and supplies.
You could use gas stations to set traps for enemies too.

Hexen 2:
This one is one of my personal favorites. A fantasy RPG/FPS hybrid, hexen 2 was a game with many different themes and ideas. Something it focused heavily on was puzzle solving. It amazes me to see how complex they made the puzzles - and beating it was quite a challenge. It is only enhanced further by the fact that it supports coop play - which makes it quite satisfying. With 4 different classes to play as, it offers nicely varied play styles too.

            <p>Here’s another one i liked, Alien Breed 3D for the amiga - a contender to doom at the time. It had some nice features such as rooms over rooms, and even refractive and clear water. Not the best game ever, but certainly fun.<br>

            <p>Here’s 2 of my favorites i forgot about -</p>
<p>Space Hulk (AMIGA,DOS) + Space Hulk - Vengeance of the Blood Angels (WINDOWS 95):</p>
<p>These games i played as a kid, both were quite scary, and the basic idea was you’d move your squad of marines, or terminators through an abandoned hulk overrun with Genestealers (warhammer’s xenomorphs if you will) It was very tactical, fun and scary. It had various objectives based off the board game, such as flaming rooms, collecting archive records, placing field generators, etc.<br>
The Second space hulk introduced a network multiplayer mode which made for great fun doing missions cooperatively, and i believe there was a deathmatch mode where you and another player both have a squad of terminators and duke it out.</p>

<p>Level design is bland, alot of brown brown brown, and the weapons are meh, it’s slightly less mediocre than Redneck Rampage, but if you wanna enjoy your DOS first person shooting Shadow Warrior and Duke3D are the way to go.</p>

It had much less good graphics than Deus Ex, and it isnt as old as Heretic, but it’s a really fun and it’s a "Lost/Unknown game|.<br>
it’s a bit like James bond with a lot of weapons and the choice to play in stealth or to play in full action.</p>

<p>Loved that game, actually still have the game in those old big boxes PC games used to come in.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/370441" data-bbcode="true">https://www.gamespot.com/370441</a></p>
<p>Was released in 2001 to little fanfare, so it wasn’t a big commercial hit. Quite advanced for the time, it featured real-time enemy dismemberment, global dynamic shadows 3 full years before Doom 3, made heavy use of procedural technologies and best of all, had a very strategic and engaging gameplay.</p>
<p>Basically it’s a third person hack’n’slash with rpg elements, where you can choose one out of 4 characters to play with and each character has very different combat techniques and skills.</p>
<p>The big selling points of the game were its difficult and realistic melee combat system, and the realistic gore system. Unlike many other hack’n’slash games of the time, killing enemies didn’t rely on clicking buttons as fast as possible, but actually relied on skill and timing. To use a much more well known example, the combat system is very similar to Oblivion’s, in that you need to rely a lot on well timed attacks and blocks. However the game is quite more difficult than Oblivion even on the early levels and even the weaker enemies can take you down in a few seconds if you don’t block and dodge their attacks successfully.</p>
<p>The gore system was revolutionary for the time. It was the first game to use the blood spilling effect on walls and I believe it was done procedurally. It was pretty awesome to see the blood running down walls at the time. The dismemberment system was also real-time and instead of using pre-cut body parts, you were actually able to cut down an enemy in pieces the way you wanted, however it wasn’t perfect and you could only cut down their limbs and heads. The torso was only able to be cut down in half if you happen to level up while slashing down their torso with a big sword. Also, there weren’t ragdoll physics, they used canned death animations, and when one enemy had one of those slow death animations where they still stand up for a bit before they fall to the ground and you cut their legs off while they’re still still on their feet, they keep acting like if they still had their legs attached and even the shadow keeps showing their legs attached to their body.</p>
<p>It’s a very fun and engaging game despite the bugs and I’d recommend anyone to try it out.</p>
