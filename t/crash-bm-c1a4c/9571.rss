    <title>[Crash] bm_c1a4c</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-bm-c1a4c/9571</link>
    <description>First: Great work guys! This is actually a masterpiece regarding the HL-universe.

Unfortunatly, I cant play anymore. Anytime I activate the fan to activate the fuel-room for the tentacle-guy the game will crash. There is a small sound when the fan is starting to rotate really fast. After that...crash.

Thx a lot in advance!

            <p>People, please do forum search before bumping threads like this with “Any clues?” posts. It is a well known BM bug, there are dozens of reports about it and there’s a known workaround for the problem that had been reported to work for many players. Just try using the forum search button, I don’t want to copy-paste possible workaround in yet another thread.</p>

            <p>I’m getting this exact problem too.  The first time I activated the fan, I missed getting up the ladder before it started spinning too fast, so I was stuck under it.  I sat there a while to see if I could figure a way out, and then died trying to climb up.  The fan was spinning at full speed during this point (and I didn’t crash).  Second time, activated the fan, made it up the first ladder, climbed up the second ladder, and just as I turned around, dismounting the ladder, the game crashed (hl2.exe has stopped working).  A third time yielded the exact same result.  Not sure if this has something to do with the fan itself or getting to (or looking at) a certain point after activating the fan, but I am now stuck and can’t get passed this.</p>
<p>There was only one other time I had a crash and that was at very beginning of the silo chapter, as the army of Houndeyes rushed me, the game randomly crashed.  Hoping to get this fixed soon so I can continue playing this awesome remake!</p>
<p>Edit: Tried again, this time only climbed up the first ladder to get above the fan and then stared at it.  Within a second or two of the fan starting to make it’s buzzing/humming sound as it spun up, I crashed.</p>
<p>Edit2: Decided to noclip passed the fan portion and everything seemed to work fine.  I opened the fuel (or whatever it is) valves and went on my way, as I zoned into the previous (next) area, my game crashed on the loading screen.</p>
