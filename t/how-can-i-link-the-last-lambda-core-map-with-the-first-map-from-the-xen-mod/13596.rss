    <title>How Can I Link The Last Lambda Core Map With The First Map From The XEN MOD ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-can-i-link-the-last-lambda-core-map-with-the-first-map-from-the-xen-mod/13596</link>
    <description>well, there&#39;s an unofficial xen map pack witch you can download from here
[url]https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-xen-improved-maps-from-half-life/downloads[/url]
install them in order, start with 0.1 and then get and install the newer one as well... these maps can only be played via chapter select... is it possible to create a seamless transition between the last lambda core map (where gordon goes to xen) and the first xen map ? (i don&#39;t like using chapter select, you spawn with different ammo and health stats, and if feels strange to beat lambda core, only to go to the credits, then starting a new game from xen)... so how would i go about doing this ? note that i don&#39;t know the first thing about map editing, so go easy on me, and yes, i have the SourceSDK set up for black mesa and it works fine... also, just a thought, if anyone here feels / wants to do this on their own and then make it available as a download to the main mod page, that&#39;d be cool, otherwise help is welcomed.

Thanks  :smiley:</description>

<p>It’s not a perfectly simple task in your case. You’d have to decompile the last LC map and the first of the Xen mod, probably (almost definitely) clean up a lot of issues brought on by decompiling maps, then connect them via the map change entities in typical Source changelevel fashion. You’d also have to disable the credits and endgame triggers in the LC map, and make appropriate modifications to them to trigger the transition. Then test compiles of both maps to make sure it works, then final compiles once confirmed, rebuild cubemaps, etc. It all might be a bit much for someone with no Source level design experience, though the VDCW would help.</p>
