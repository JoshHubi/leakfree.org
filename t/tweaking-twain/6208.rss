    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tweaking-twain/6208</link>
    <description>There is a story here in the United States about a guy that wants to censor Mark Twain&#39;s story about Huckleberry Finn.  If you haven&#39;t read the story, Huckleberry Finn befriends a black man named Jim.  The story is scathing look at racism and southern US antebellum society.

The story contains the &quot;N-word&quot; for black person upwards of over 200 times and other racial slurs, as well as very coarse language.

Professor Alan Gribben, a Twain scholar, says that the prolific use of the N-word and other slurs (such as &quot;Injun&quot;) and the coarse language is prompting many US schools to stop teaching the anti-racism classic and is pushing for a release where &quot;Injun&quot; is replaced with &quot;Indian&quot; and the N-word is replaced with &quot;slave&quot;...among other edits.

What is your opinion on this?  Should it be changed?  I&#39;d love to hear the outside-the-US perspective on this, too.

My take is that you can&#39;t just sweep this stuff under the rug and trying to erase it is actually worse than the racism itself.  As Twain said, &quot;the difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter&quot;.

Your take?</description>

<p>i live in a predominantly black area and when the teacher read us the book she said “nigger” and all the white kids were like hee and the black kids were like :I</p>
<p>also if it’s going to be read in class ya an introduction and perhaps something to give parents where they sign it if they dont want their kid to be a part of it</p>

<p>I was just going by chance. Slavery has been a major feature of most of the world at some point in human history. In any case this is all irrelevant. No one here believes in slavery. No one here ever believed in slavery. As a widespread socially acceptable system it died with the South.</p>

            <p>oic. You’re right, I didn’t catch the “pushing for a release” part, just the “stop teaching the anti-racism classic.” In that case: NO - He cannot change the book. YES - He can petition that schools stop teaching the book.</p>

<p>Free speech in America often falls victim to the so-called “political correctness” movement, as is art and literature. That’s what I was getting at. This is an example of such an attempt to censor an important piece of literature, just because people might feel uncomfortable reading it or having it read out to them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But it’s an attempt by a single person, not the government or schools themselves. It’s the petition of one man who happens to be a professor and it apparently attracted some attention. I’m sure that people in Germany may think that, using your example, the Holocaust shouldn’t be taught in schools. When it comes down to it, though, schools, public schools, anyway, are run by the government. Just because this particular professor takes offense at it doesn’t mean that it’s going to be censored at all.</p>
<p>Daniel, one man making an attempt to remove a book from the curriculum != infringing on others’ right to free speech. He is completely within his bounds to petition the book if he so pleases. I mean, if he finds it obscene, why shouldn’t he? Don’t get me wrong; I’m against censorship. I’m just playing the devil’s advocate here.</p>

<p>If the same was done in Germany, kids in school would never again be taught about the holocaust, or at all about the Third Reich, because their poor little souls could be offended by what they learn.</p>
<p>Instead, what schools actually do is, they send their pupils to the nearest concentration camp museum and have them watch old black and white footage of hundreds of dead jews being shoved into mass graves by bulldozers.</p>
<p>And that’s the way it should be. Never let your children forget what terrible things men are able to do to each other, if they are just taught to do so.</p>

<p>Two massive problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You’re from Canada, which was until (relatively) recently an English colony, and before that a French colony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its irrelevant if your “people” enslaved blacks. Its 150 years later, we are a new generation, we can move on, not shove our heads in the sand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, I think that if a word is only as bad as the meaning behind it. If you read the words “nigger” in a book, then you’ve just read a word. If you call someone it then you are insulting them and its a problem. Banning the people from seeing the word only makes them not understand this concept, and will just lead to more censorship.</p>

            <p>You implied that I implied that he was squelching people’s freedom of speech. All I was saying is that him expressing his opinion about what should be taught in schools doesn’t affect anybody else’s right to the freedom of speech.</p>

            <p>He’s petitioning for schools to drop the book from their curriculum. It’s within his bounds to do so. I’m not saying I agree with him, and I certainly don’t think the book should be changed, but it’s his right as an American to share his views about what is taught to our children. Hell, my high school had an issue way back when with a parent who didn’t think that Greek mythology should be taught to children. He was shot down pretty quickly, but as far as I’m concerned people should be (and are) allowed to petition about what gets taught in their children’s classes. We’re allowed to fight their opinions right back.</p>

            <p>Actually, his freedom of speech does not extend to squelching other’s freedom of speech.   The book is not his property.</p>

            <p>I didn’t say that. We’re having this discussion, aren’t we? I was specifically talking about Danson’s free speech joke.</p>

<p>Yup, because only he’s allowed to express his opinion and we’re not, right?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
