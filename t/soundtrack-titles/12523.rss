    <title>Soundtrack Titles</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/soundtrack-titles/12523</link>
    <description>I&#39;d just like to say that, after deep consideration, I really love Black Mesa.  It&#39;s clear that a ton of manpower was put into creating it, and the end product, despite any flaws, still shines through.  I think all reasonable people can agree on that.  Furthermore, I think we can all agree that Joel Nielsen&#39;s soundtrack was among Black Mesa&#39;s best qualities.

However, I have one objection to his soundtrack - and that would be the titles of the songs.  With the exception of &quot;Black Mesa Theme&quot; and &quot;Black Mesa End Credits&quot;, all of the tracks are simply named after the chapters in which they are present.  While this is descriptive, I suppose, I&#39;ve always been impressed by the track titles in the Half-Life series.  For your consideration, I present to you my retitled version of Black Mesa&#39;s soundtrack.  I don&#39;t have anything nearly as clever as CP Violation on there, but I did my best.  I would further suggest that anyone else with creative ideas for new track titles post them in this thread.  This is just a fun thread, nothing more, nothing less.   :slight_smile: 

Inbound 1-3 =&gt; Uncertainty 1-3
Anomalous Materials =&gt; Proper Precautions
Black Mesa Theme =&gt; Destroyer Of Worlds
Unforeseen Consequences =&gt; Wedge Maneuver
Office Complex =&gt; Dry Ice
We&#39;ve Got Hostiles =&gt; Occam&#39;s Razor
Blast Pit 1 =&gt; Echoes From Afar
Blast Pit 2 =&gt; Problem Solving
Blast Pit 3 =&gt; Rocket Opera
Power Up =&gt; Transcendent Futility
On A Rail 1 =&gt; Track Trek
On A Rail 2 =&gt; He Will Pay
Apprehension =&gt; Shipwreck On Land
Residue Processing =&gt; Recovery
Questionable Ethics 1 =&gt; Arrogance Through Ignorance
Questionable Ethics 2 =&gt; Superior Orders
Surface Tension 1 =&gt; Overflow
Surface Tension 2 =&gt; Stop And Vertigo
Surface Tension 3 =&gt; Unanticipated Cluster
Surface Tension 4 =&gt; Lines In Space
Forget About Freeman =&gt; Eyes Look Your Last
Lambda Core =&gt; Contaminated Sanctuary

I&#39;ll decline to name the two end credit tracks because Xen hasn&#39;t come out yet, so their final context is still up in the air.</description>

        <title>Soundtrack Titles</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[RK1]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I wanted to bump this four-year-old topic for a couple reasons. Namely, I wanted to revisit it because I’ve given some recent thought on soundtrack titles (especially since some new songs have been added since this thread’s lifetime), and also kinda draw attention to it. On an aside note, I’ve just completed a four year physics degree (and am moving on for a doctorates), and I’ve been exposed to many physical concepts in that time. My revised song list will more or less reflect this. I also revisited some song titles that I realized were redundant or, quite frankly, didn’t make too much sense to me.</p>
<p>Black Mesa Theme - Black Mesa Theme<br>
Gamestartup1 - Ominous Opportunities<br>
Gamestartup2 - Systematic Uncertainty<br>
Inbound 1 - 8:47 a.m.<br>
Inbound 2 - Inbound<br>
Inbound 3 - Equal Opportunity<br>
Anomalous Materials - HEV mk. IV<br>
Black Mesa Remix - Aftermath of a Resonance Cascade<br>
Unforeseen Consequences - Wedge Maneuver<br>
Misc. 1 - Leaps and Bounds<br>
Office Complex - Dry Ice<br>
We’ve Got Hostiles! - Occam’s Razor<br>
Misc. 2 - Idea of Containment<br>
Misc. 5 - Descending Order<br>
Blast Pit 1 - Rocket Test Labs<br>
Misc. 6 - Air Pressure<br>
Misc. 7 - Photoelectric Effect<br>
Blast Pit 2 - Faraday’s Law<br>
Blast Pit 3 - Rocket Opera<br>
Misc. 4 - Combustion<br>
Power Up - Power Up<br>
On a Rail 1 - Old Rail System<br>
Year of Death - Year of Death<br>
Lights Out - Lights Out<br>
Dark Skies - Dark Skies<br>
On a Rail 2 - Ground Zero<br>
Apprehension (remix) - Apprehension<br>
Apprehension (original) - Event Horizon<br>
Residue Processing - Unwanted Contaminants<br>
Misc. 8 - Ethical Standards<br>
Questionable Ethics 2 - Deep Inelastic Scattering<br>
Questionable Ethics 1 - Military Tactics<br>
Surface Tension 1 - Surface Tension<br>
Surface Tension 2 - Cliffside Vertigo<br>

Surface Tension 3 - Fight or Flight<br>
Forget About Freeman - Last Ditch Effort<br>
Lambda Core - Lambda Reactor Complex<br>
Misc. 3 - Coolant Reservoir<br>
End Credits - End Credits</p>
<p>It’s also probable that this topic will get bumped again once Xen comes out and we see what songs are contained therein.</p>

<p>i would not have brought it up just because of similar precussion, i also noticed both songs share that “windy breath fade-in” sound</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve always been a fan of the single-word name. Most Half-Life series songs have several words in their names, though.</p>

            <p>Totally forgot about the other piece that plays during Apprehension. When Gordon is knocked out and taken to the trash compactor.</p>
<p>My first idea is Foreboding Chill</p>

            <p>Why don’t you message this to Joel  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  This are actually well thought I think he might consider them. Also maybe Inbound should be called: “Big day” though I don’t remember hearing lines of “big day today” like it was in half life.</p>

<p>For the ambient tracks, here are my initial suggestions.<br>
Ambiance One (UC box room): One Giant Leap   (for mankind)<br>
Ambiance Two (WGH end scientist): Idea of Containment<br>
Ambiance Three (LC pre-reactor): Coolant Reservoir<br>
Ambiance Four (PU at wounded guard): Combustion<br>
Ambiance Five (BP start elevator): Descent into Madness<br>
Ambiance Six (BP radioactive elevator): Decay Velocity<br>
Ambiance Seven (BP fan shaft ladder): Air Pressure<br>
Ambiance Eight (QE grunt display): Technical Malpractice</p>
<p>And some suggestions for existing names:<br>
Surface Tension 2: Vertical Vertigo<br>
Anomalous Materials: They’re waiting for you<br>
Blast Pit 2: Potential Dynamics<br>
Residue Processing: Contaminated Sanitation</p>
<p>OR<br>
Anomalous Materials: These ridiculous ties<br>

            <p>If anyone comes up with better titles, try to use more abstract terms like the tracks in Half-Life and Half-Life 2. “Slow Light”, “Pulse Phase”, “Entanglement”, “Miscount Detected”, to say a few. Or simpler ones like “Nova Prospekt”, “Ravenholm Reprise”, or “Calabi-Yau Model”.</p>
<p>There are also some ambient tracks not on the official album but can be heard in the game and can be obtained through the game’s sound files. If anyone can come up with names for those too…</p>

            <p>I’d just like to say that, after deep consideration, I really love Black Mesa.  It’s clear that a ton of manpower was put into creating it, and the end product, despite any flaws, still shines through.  I think all reasonable people can agree on that.  Furthermore, I think we can all agree that Joel Nielsen’s soundtrack was among Black Mesa’s best qualities.</p>
<p>However, I have one objection to his soundtrack - and that would be the titles of the songs.  With the exception of “Black Mesa Theme” and “Black Mesa End Credits”, all of the tracks are simply named after the chapters in which they are present.  While this is descriptive, I suppose, I’ve always been impressed by the track titles in the Half-Life series.  For your consideration, I present to you my retitled version of Black Mesa’s soundtrack.  I don’t have anything nearly as clever as CP Violation on there, but I did my best.  I would further suggest that anyone else with creative ideas for new track titles post them in this thread.  This is just a fun thread, nothing more, nothing less.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Inbound 1-3 =&gt; Uncertainty 1-3<br>
Anomalous Materials =&gt; Proper Precautions<br>
Black Mesa Theme =&gt; Destroyer Of Worlds<br>
Unforeseen Consequences =&gt; Wedge Maneuver<br>
Office Complex =&gt; Dry Ice<br>
We’ve Got Hostiles =&gt; Occam’s Razor<br>
Blast Pit 1 =&gt; Echoes From Afar<br>
Blast Pit 2 =&gt; Problem Solving<br>
Blast Pit 3 =&gt; Rocket Opera<br>
Power Up =&gt; Transcendent Futility<br>
On A Rail 1 =&gt; Track Trek<br>
On A Rail 2 =&gt; He Will Pay<br>
Apprehension =&gt; Shipwreck On Land<br>
Residue Processing =&gt; Recovery<br>
Questionable Ethics 1 =&gt; Arrogance Through Ignorance<br>
Questionable Ethics 2 =&gt; Superior Orders<br>
Surface Tension 1 =&gt; Overflow<br>
Surface Tension 2 =&gt; Stop And Vertigo<br>
Surface Tension 3 =&gt; Unanticipated Cluster<br>
Surface Tension 4 =&gt; Lines In Space<br>
Forget About Freeman =&gt; Eyes Look Your Last<br>
Lambda Core =&gt; Contaminated Sanctuary</p>
<p>I’ll decline to name the two end credit tracks because Xen hasn’t come out yet, so their final context is still up in the air.</p>
