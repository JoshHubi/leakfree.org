    <title>MD5 ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/md5/10380</link>
    <description>Hello,

I cant seem to find an MD5 for the mod anywhere but IN the download.

The point of an md5 is not only to assure the download was not corrupted but ALSO that the file was not changed somewhere between it&#39;s origin and the person that downloaded it.

Only making the md5 available in the download package itself means that I can not verify that the download was not &quot;modified&quot; by a 3rd party because they could modify the md5 in the package as easily as they could infect the package.

Can we please get an &quot;Official Black Mesa MD5&quot; posted on the website so that everyone knows they have a clean copy?

Thanks</description>

<p>Why dont you just check the file with your virus scanner?</p>

<p>Well considering that it can take anywhere from a day to a month for a brand new virus to be detected and then the time it takes for it to be added to all the different companies scanners the MD5 is much faster.</p>
<p>It’s a 32 character text string that they already put in the zip, an admin could even post an official md5 thread with it listed</p>
