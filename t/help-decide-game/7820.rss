    <description>Hi Guys,

Im a PC gamer and dont usually buy alot of games due to there being sooo much cr*p out there - I have nothing against consoles, but I do get fed up with all the ports to PC stuff. I dont mind if they make a decent port, but few are!

Anyway, to the point, it seems next month a few games that have been on my game radar are due out, including one already out!

Deus Ex - Human Revolution. I was initially not interested as the gameplay videos made it look like the worse console port ever! However, it turns out its actually really good and plays on the PC well - you can turn off that yellow line gunk thats displays every item for you like a child! - YAY

Rage - I love Doom and stuff like that and usually like ID games. I was a bit worried about Rage being a port, but it does look really interesting. I really need to check this out. 

Serious Sam 3 - Looks fantastic and a must have! However, though I get excited seeing the gameplay videos, it is looking very same-y as the first ones (excluding number 2 which was pants). I know there are lots of new features, pulling monsters eyes out - wow. Is it going to be worth full purchase price?

I was going to get Deus Ex - as reviews are good, dont know about others yet. So I can play it safe - but I always play games months even years after everybody else such as recently both Mass Effects. Be nice to play something NEW while everybody else is.....just for that &#39;new&#39; feeling!

Anyway, sorry about long post - I always ramble.

Votes please!  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>As DiePoente said, Serious Sam is a lot of fun with friends, however I had fun with SS3 single player too, plus, it´s not full price, check it on steam : )</p>

            <p>Deus Ex is more Splinter Cell First-Person. You don’t shoot mostly. Well, you can, but it’s by far better and easier to sneak. It has a long playing time, and a high replay value. If you want something for your money and to play several days/weeks, and you like to plan, how you want to reach your goal, and if you like role-play games, then Deus Ex is perfect for you.</p>
<p>I can’t tell much about Rage. It’s gonna have Coop. It will be good, cause it’s from ID Software and if you like these Fallout scenarios, then it might be a choice for you.</p>
<p>Serious Sam 3. Well, playing Serious Sam alone was never really funny, but playing with friends is awesome. If you have friends who might buy it, then it’s a choice for you.</p>
