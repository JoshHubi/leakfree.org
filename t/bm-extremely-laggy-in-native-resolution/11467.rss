    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bm-extremely-laggy-in-native-resolution/11467</link>
    <description>Whenever I try to play any Source game in my native resolution - which is 1440x900 - it&#39;s extremely laggy, even with lowest settings. When I try to move around in my native resolution, my PC just completely crashes. Is there any fix for this?</description>

<p>I think I must reformulate my answer. Yes, the resolution of a game can consume some RAM, because of the scaling of the screen and the textures details (they are more crisp, causing a certain increase of the RAM consumption and use the power of the graphics card more).In SOME cases (with the older computers), it can really damage your materials because of the overheat, OR, if the actual user use some cheap and non-regulated over-clocking, it will blow your motherboard and,worse, your entire computer.</p>
<p>With the actual specs of some users here, it will not do anything, but make your games laggy. Just play on a minimized resolution and also see :</p>

<p>for some increased acceleration for your game.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And killernerd, just check what I’m talking about, and after come to say if I’m wrong. But, you must stay polite, OK? Don’t insult me. What I just saying about ‘‘broken materials’’, is for the older computers only. :meh:</p>

<p>Little guys, when you play on a PC game, never EVER play your games on your native resolution, until you got a really powerful computer. It will crash and possibly damage your graphic card or your motherboard (by overloading her memory).</p>
<p>I play on 1024x - 768x and I have a 1440x - 900x monitor and…you know what? Not only I can put the game to the max graphics, it works flawlessly and the image quality is better (wierd,eh?).

            <p>sorry to hijack this thread but i’m having the same issue and i’m quite sure it’s not the computer…</p>
<p>Even running the game at the absolute lowest settings i’m only getting 23fps at most at 1680x1050.</p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<p>Rampage IV extreme<br>
intel core i7 3820<br>
16 gigs ddr3<br>
2 HD7970 in crossfire<br>
powered by a 1.05kW corsair PSU</p>
<p>game is running of a OCZ vertex 3 ssd</p>
<p>I too have yet to try another resolution though. brb, trying out now.</p>
<p>edit: lowering resolution does help but it’s still very strange…</p>

<p>Those specs are just a bit below minimum requirements, and if you consider the small texture memory of this card you’re lucky to get good framerates at low-res. I tested it on a similar low-end card, the Radeon x1300 (32mb RAM) and it was pretty playable at 800x600 but at 1280x800 it was sluggish… Keep in mind that was on a Core2Duo, not Pentium D which is previous-gen.</p>

<p>I kinda figured. Are there any good upgrades I could get that won’t fry my motherboard, and are below $100?</p>
