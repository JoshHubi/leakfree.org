    <title>Co-Op still can be played!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/co-op-still-can-be-played/4461</link>
    <description>Im pretty sure with SOME console commands such as,

sv_lan

sv_region

That max players command.

I remembered there was a command that made two copys of weapons appear (so if you picked up a crowbar, there still is one left for a friend)

Dont flame me about co-op, I am not butthurt about it being gone.</description>

<p>Touche…</p>
<p>Question: How are they going to apprehend both Gordon and the buddy in Apprehension, if Gordon steps into the room and the buddy stays outside? How will two people navigate those areas which only allow 1 person to pass through?</p>

<p>easy they have already done it in sven coop, they just both appear in the grabage disposal because either way you just spawn in that map.</p>
<p>I dont know why people are saying it sucks, from what some people have said when they played it for a little bit they played sucky maps because some are lengendary and some creators are awsome at it. Also it is 10 times better when your playing with close friends in a LAN party. Because you can have any map with any game because its relatively easy to create a map in the half life 1 engine. and so you can have a laugh. i have always liked coop because its makes it’s more interesting than being on your own for a whole game.<br>
Of course if you have a jerk with you then its gonna be annoying but thats just common sense.</p>

            <p>Is Synergy a good alternative for Co-Op?</p>
<p>All there needs to be done are some settings at the default spawn, and maybe something like allow more players on those carts, and let them respawn.</p>

            <p>So the fact that they’re still working on SC1 and don’t have all that much experience with the Source engine doesn’t matters then? There are other factors, but i can’t tell you those because they’re not publicly known yet.</p>

<p>It is an argument since the SC devs said they wouldn’t make one on the current Source engine, it’s too much work for too little gain, especially when there’s other co-op mods already out there.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In my eyes this just means, that the devs don’t have any innovative ideas for a sequel, so that they need something “new” and “shiny” to hide this fact.</p>

</aside>
<p>I have to agree with you. I played it several times, but almost every map had a boring and crappy level design and sometimes it’s just a frustrating “die and respawn”.</p>

<p>Sven co-op 2 won’t be made by the original team, the Source engine is already 6 years old.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is no argument. There are still people starting HL1 mod projects and for other games that are even older.</p>

<p>Exactly. If there will be a Sven Coop 2, it will be with Source 2.0 or whatever Valve’s next engine is.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There will be no “next” engine, as long as Source fits their needs (that’s what Gabe Newell said last time). But there will come great new features with the next Source Engine upgrade (rewritten rendering path, enhanced lighting and so on).</p>

            <p>Of the two of them Synergy actually seems like you’re playing through HL2 with other people. Obsidian Conflict just seems like an attempt at Sven Co-op 2.</p>

            <p>haha…</p>
<p>also I played Synergy a bit and also Obsidian Conflict. but I think Synergy is more of a a proper co-op for the HL2 story.</p>
<p>what are your takes?</p>
