    <description>Part 2 of the story was created for those who made sure they let me know who had been left out!

Patonki&#39;s body was rolled beside Daniel just as Dr. Strangelove had received the results of the Rossman angeogram that he had ordered. Fortunately, danielsangeo gram came back clean and, thanks to the Rossman company, he had plenty of time to relish in its results. Yes, he had gone Flatline earlier and Triage had all but decided he was dead but obviously they didn&#39;t know what they were talking about.

The Shadi looking nurse slipped a new Maxey pad on him, pulled up his Fancy Pants and left the room. Those pants felt sersoft on his injured (rot)(fodder legs and he was glad to have them. That damn Kairouseki motorcycle was the cause of all of this and the Lincoln Conti nental, that he thought he could beat across the intersection, just seemed to have come out of nowhere. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t beat it and now he&#39;s laying in the eastern wing of the Eric Fong Hospital watching a game on TV between a bunch of ridiculous ferrets. With a score of acade365 and Bluemen230 with two minutes left there didn&#39;t seem much need to continue watching so, he switched over to some space science channel talking about CygNuS Ryλn and how it&#39;s starting to expand and become TheSuperNova from hell. 

Just at that time, PoliceKING Cpl.1nsane entered the room. &quot;Just what I need&quot;, thought Daniel, some Evil-Police looking dude coming in to ask questions. He was a mankyman6 foot tall or so and as he entered he quickly turned to Bolteh the door behind him. Daniel should have recognized him. He had fought him in international competition years ago and lost badly. 

An expert in both Tae Kwan Do, as well as Kaweebo, Cpl.1nsane had defeated both him and that RabidMonkey BahamutBBob years ago in Singapore. That definitely wasn&#39;t a good trip. Daniel even lost to russilker The X_Mastershot,_X anaxed induced though he was. It always seemed rather odd that russilker was never banned for illegal drug use yet Swampfox and calhoun freeman were sent to the BlackMesaResearchFacily years ago for just possessing ac3d. Funny....they seemed to have just vanished.

Cpl.1nsane was there because the signature on his drivers license didn&#39;t match the Siggs on the hospital admission forms and the hospital&#39;s SassyRobot computer kicked it out. Jean, the nurse on duty, had just entered the room when the Corporal turned to her and said &quot;Jeannotvb y God! I want it quiet in here&quot;. Turning towards him she asked &quot;Are you serious or are you Jokerine?&quot; One look towards the Corporal answered her question. She turned the TV off then on the way out the room said &quot;call me at Nightmare470-555-1212 if you need anything&quot; then she quickly left the room.

&quot;Ya know&quot; said Cpl.1nsane, &quot;TheeGoatPig monster had been seen in the area recenlty. Heard anything about it?&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, said Daniel. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. 

&quot;Perhaps it&#39;s nothing, just local legend I suppose. Kind of like what you were back in Singapore&quot;.

Daniel looked at him and immediately recognized who he was. it was a small discrepancy, probably not a problem but at least he knew one thing. Don&#39;t mess With the JEW-FRO cause You Gonna Get Raped. This was the man who had beat him, the man who had defeated him and now he realized he was also the man behind the wheel of that Lincoln Conti nental that appeared out of nowhere. The same man who wheeled the mangled corpse of Patonki into the emergency room to rest beside him.

He knew he was next...........
