    <title>Some options keep resetting themselves or change</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-options-keep-resetting-themselves-or-change/13842</link>
    <description>To start off I want to thank you guys for this amazing rehash of the mod, multiplayer is tons of fun. However, Some options in the options menu reset themselfes everytime I restart the game. 

Options like &quot;Enable auto-aim&quot; do this. As well as some options in the control rebinds like strave left and right. I rebind them to use the arrow keys (left handed use) however It keeps resetting them to &quot;,&quot;and &quot;.&quot;. Hopefully you&#39;ll be able to fix them soon. ^^</description>
