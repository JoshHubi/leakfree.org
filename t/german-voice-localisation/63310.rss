    <description>Hello guys,

I just want to create a german voice localisation for black mesa. To do so I will look for some voice actors wich want to be part of it and rerecord the voice lines with them.

Anyway... I need some help with it. I own a copy of black mesa and want to extract the voice files from it to show them to the voice actors to help them make there recordings more fitable to the original. I have no idea how to get these files... Any ideas? :/</description>
