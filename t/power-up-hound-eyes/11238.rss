    <title>Power Up Hound eyes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/power-up-hound-eyes/11238</link>
    <description>Theres a section in Power Up where there is a broken stair case if you walk to the edge of this staircase then you can easily kill all the houndeyes here before dropping down...

It&#39;s only a minor thing but the placement of these houndeyes could do with moving so that they run in only once you have dropped down.

They also get stuck on the stairs below too.  So better to keep them away from here

So It&#39;s just a suggestion but would be good to change their placement in this area so that they only attack and can be seen by the player once you drop down to the stairs below. Perhaps put one in a vent to smash through or something when you drop down into this area with the others following the attack from the corridors on this level.

Where ever they are placed they might be noticing you are there too soon when you are on the walkway above with the marines and sandbags from the black mesa trailer.

When you come down the stairs they start getting stuck in the stairs below because they cannot navigate up to where you drop down from .</description>

            <p>Yeah, they can be cheesed way to easy by standing on the half-broken stairs after you drop and they can’t get to you.</p>
<p>They also have issues with pathing around other houndeye ragdolls.</p>
