    <title>Black Mesa SP-Mod in the making</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-sp-mod-in-the-making/3384</link>
    <description>o Hello people. First uf i&#39;d like to introduce myself. i&#39;m a long time lurker from switzerland who descided to sign up today. Please excuse spelling errors and such, i&#39;m used to talk german  :slight_smile:  but i think we should get along.

Now i&#39;m not realy sure if this fits in the &quot;Show off&quot;-Section because i don&#39;t have to much to show of yet, and i rather take this thread to find some people who are interested in making something with me &amp; presenting my little plot

Thing is: i worked out a little story within typical half-life enviroments. The player will control a maintenance worker who has off that day and awakes around 9.30 in his apartment in the Sector D Dormitories. the character is responsable for the storage of radioactive waste. He has no hair and looks awkward, plus he has his own personal HEV in his wardrobe inside the apartment. 
You will first search for survivors &amp; a keycard inside 3 or 4 diffrent appartment-blocks (2 for science and 1 for security &amp; maintenance workers) i&#39;m planing on giving each accessable appartment a very own look, so you can see who lives here. you will be visiting Dr. Breen&#39;s mega penthouse suite as well :3. Team up &amp; get access to the tram station. 
So much for the first map.. Now i don&#39;t want to giva away to much so soon but the storyline will sure have many many comical situations and plenty of black humor. The player is intended to be the typical loser guy who always brings his fellas into trouble.
I also made sure that i there is a good mix of combat, exploring and puzzles troughout the whole story (5 Chapters so far)
It&#39;s only on paper so far but if someone is realy interested i can write it down on computer in english.
Of course i already made some layouts and even a few orange maps.

To come to a point: I know there are lots of people on these forums who use hammer as well, and i wondered if someone is intersted in making a little SP-Champaign with me. So if you like what you read please get in contact. Of course everything is possible and we can share &amp; change concepts and ideas.

Also, some early screens:

<p>Exactly. It would be about puzzles, exploration, and not shooting everything in sight for once.</p>

            <p>You know what would make it a lot more interesting, in my opinion? Forcing the player to spend a fairly large chunk of the beginning to navigate through the facility <span class="bbcode-i">without</span> an HEV suit, in search of one. It make it that much more interesting to be weak and weaponless, and have to navigate a hostile environment carefully. Then, this way, you can place an HEV suit in a place it would actually go, rather than in a wardrobe.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>to be honest,i uploaded it to facebook because it was the fastest solution without signing up on another hosting page. (lazy me)<br>
@ Ibanez: i chose it because i just like the design of the house. that’s it. it looks cool and that is the only reason. i’m sure with the right textures on it and a few rocks and desert it will make a whole other apperance<br>
@ blackout: yeh, i know. i tought about maybe acessing a room with a HEV-Container trough a secret door in the wardrobe. i mainly included this idea because the player need a HEV suit right from the start &amp; this would propably the only logical place to put it.</p>
<p>trees will be replaced with cactus and gras with sand ^^ i just put it there to make it look a little nicer</p>
<p>well. guess i’m better off searching for some mates on moddb. but thanks for the feedback guise</p>

            <p>It’s a good story to tell. I agree with most of the posts.<br>
If you want to make a “BM mod mod”  with your work you will have to put your ideas somewhere in a desert. Loose the combine signs. Other stuff looks damn sexy  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>very good idea but a few problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>black mesa is in the nevada desert and that shot up at the to is in a forest environment,<br>
2)the character wouldn’t have an HEV suit in his wardrobe, that’s a crazy idea: firstly it belongs to black mesa not to him, secondly you can’t store an HEV suit in a wardrobe they have to be kept in the containers,</li>
<li>and what beeseik said: get rid of the combine design.</li>
</ol>
<p>apart from that, very good idea. I wish you good luck.</p>

            <p>I must say, I would never think of uploading my map editing pictures to facebook.</p>
<p>And they say it has combine design because it uses decals that have combine logos on it. And if you’re trying to make a Black Mesa themed mod, why use inspirations from comedy central? It all looks good, but it doesn’t look like Black Mesa.</p>

            <p>i tought its understood that all textures are placeholders. they will be all be replaced. Interesting that you think that it is “combine” design, because it’s actually based of the “Drawn Together” house from comedy central <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
