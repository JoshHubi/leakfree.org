    <description>So I recently got BF3.  There is a problem I am having, you see when origin runs / bf3 and then my push to talk key in steam voice chat doesn&#39;t work.  I was wondering if there was a way around this?  I can&#39;t seem to find any.</description>

<p>I’m guessing your mic picks up a lot of background noise or is too sensitive, otherwise I would recommend setting to activate when it hears something. That’s never failed for me.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, I live in a loud household.  Its not too bad though.  For some reason its very on and off on when it does this problem.</p>

<p>Stupid suggestion, here.</p>
<p>You might want to make sure Origin and BF3 are running as administrators. If that doesn’t work, you might as well switch over to mumble, ventrilo, skype, or teamspeak (far superior to steam’s voice chatting system). If the problem is still occurring, then report back.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ll try that but I don’t understand why everyone says every voice chat is better than steam?  Steam uses the skype voip codex so its quality is equal to the best.  I have had very few problems with steam voice chat in the past.  Aside from everyone once and awhile when software (like origin) makes my push to talk key not work.</p>
<p>Edit: Running in admin didn’t work.</p>
