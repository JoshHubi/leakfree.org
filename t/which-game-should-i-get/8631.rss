    <title>Which Game Should I Get?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/which-game-should-i-get/8631</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to figure out which of these three games I should buy:

Left 4 Dead
Left 4 Dead 2
Garry&#39;s Mod

I seem to be leaning towards one of the L4D games but I&#39;m not sure which one&#39;s better.

Thanks  :wink:</description>

<p>I was going to suggest the UD pack for HL: Source.  The mod is free, and the HL: S will set you back a measly ten bucks.  It’s not what anyone expects from BM, as it’s a straight 1:1 with improved textures, physics, and water.  It’s fun, but clearly not the project that these guys are working on.  Still, it’s a well-made distraction while waiting for Black Mesa.</p>

<p>So you suggest a game not even on the list of options.</p>

<p>There is seriously no reason to play L4D otherwise.</p>
<p>But yeah, get 2. The only reason I still go for L4D sometimes is because a couple of my buddies refuse to play the second.</p>

            <p>Only go with GMod if you really want a sandbox thing to screw around with and/or make videos. If you want an actual game go with L4D1/2. I liked the first one more for the characters and settings, but 2 has a lot more weapons and like DiePoente said the maps were ported to the second one.</p>

            <p>I’d say L4D2. Garry’s Mod is kind of fun but it gets boring after a while I feel. Maybe I’m just not creative enough to spend hours doing something. I’ve yet to play online as well. L4D2 is really fun though, and isn’t as repetitive as it appears to be if you’re reading about it. I’m really glad that I bought it, though I haven’t played it in a while because I’m trying to beat a few of the singleplayer games that I have but haven’t beaten yet.</p>

            <p>Garry’s mod is a sandbox, L4D2 the home of butthurt, but you can try and maybe get a decent game out of 5 attempts, or play with friends.</p>

            <p>Ugh, I say Garry’s mod.<br>
What with the toy-box now, and its cheapness, I have definitely clocked more hours on there than L4D. (I have it on X-Box)</p>
<p>The L4Ds are really repetitive imo where Garry’s mod is spontaneous and fun. Also, there are Zombie modes in Garry’s mod that are much more amusing. You get much more bang for your buck with G-Mod.</p>

            <p>Garry’s Mod and L4D aren’t really comparable so there its really your prefrence.</p>
<p>Of the L4D’s I’d say L4D2, for the reason above.  Only the most butthurt of fans would say you’d be better off buying L4D1 although I will admit there are aspects of it I like better.</p>
