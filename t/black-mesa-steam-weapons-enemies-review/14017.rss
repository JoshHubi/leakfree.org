    <title>Black Mesa(Steam) : Weapons , Enemies Review</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-steam-weapons-enemies-review/14017</link>
    <description>I love the effort you guys have put in to make Black Mesa it is professionally developed and designed and the bug fixes.
Most Improved  Weapon : MP5 I did not expect it to be useful and good. But in this version I love it&#39;s high accuracy and making fully automatic not 3 shots per fire , I took the grunts out easily on hard mode .
Honorable Mentions: TAU cannon I love how it looks and it was my best friend during Tanks and V-22 Ospery and Alien Grunt battles.
Least Improved weapon : Snarks I mean they are not gonna do anything special.
Most Improved Enemies : The HECU , Alien Grunts and Houndeyes these guys require a fairly good strategy .  Like if you through an explosive they will move away from it and you need to be fast to beat them.
So what to do you guys think? List them :thumbup:</description>

            <p>Balance pass is coming in the next update, which should be dropping shortly. I changed a bunch of stuff, including most of the comments in this thread.</p>

            <p>-Is it just me or did the magnum take a damage nerf from the mod version?  I don’t recall the Vorts being able to survive a body shot on Normal difficulty before.</p>
<p>-The shotgun makes me far happier than it really should.  Nice to see a decent spread-pattern for once rather than a weapon that’s absolutely useless outside of point-blank range.</p>
<p>-The MP5 is…Well, maybe a little <span class="bbcode-i">too</span> good at what it does.  Maybe up the recoil a little bit?  Also I miss the old GL range.  Took a while to get used to the new distance.</p>
<p>-Packs of houndeyes are now a royal pain in my ass.  Which is as it should be!</p>
<p>-The grunts are fun to fight at times…Sometimes, though they come off as rather suicidal.  Pretty much every WGH and Power Up encounter consisted of me staying put around a corner and waiting for them to charge blindly into my gunfire.  Also, while the voices are <span class="bbcode-i">much</span> improved over the mod release, the grunts don’t seem to be as talkative as before.  There’s almost no chatter whatsoever until combat starts, and even then it’s not much.  I also miss the radio filter over the voices, but that’s probably easy enough to mod in.</p>

<p>My suggestions to improve singleplayer (hard mode):</p>
<ul>
<li>decrease firerate of assasins</li>
<li>add slightly more health to bullsquids</li>
<li>add slightly more health to houndeyes</li>
<li>make headcrabs die after 3 pistol-shots</li>
<li>add more health to zombies</li>
<li>add slightly more health to aliengrunts and decrease their damage for melee-attacks<br>
this is hard mode after all… To me most of the time it’s very easy. The only really dangerous enemies are the assasins atm… because they hit all their shots, move fast and deal great damage.</li>
</ul>
