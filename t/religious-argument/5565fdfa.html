<p>At this point, I wouldn’t try to prove him wrong.  After all that’s what got you into this mess.  People of Religion are used to being proven wrong (see the earth is flat and it revolves around the sun).</p>
<p>The issue your father has is probably one of the idea that you are not mature/intelligent enough to make these decisions on your own.</p>
<p>If you want to not go to church, then you must prove this idea wrong not the idea of God(s) or religion.</p>
<p>Do NOT be a smart ass in your paper.  DO NOT have cunning ways of bashing religion in it.  DO NOT infer.  In your paper treat it like an essay for school.  Do not put subjective ideas or information other than what your father is asking.</p>
<p>Use this paper to your advantage, as a means of demonstrating you’re mature and intelligent.</p>
<p>If you want to further sway your father from believing you are ignorant, I would advise learning about non-christian religions.  Perhaps even visit their places of worship and talk to their ministers or leaders or whatever they are called and speak to them about what their religion is about.  Take the time to learn not just about the religion but what people seek out in it or why they believe it.</p>
<p>Lastly don’t try to prove that there is no god, don’t waste your time it will just make things worse.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t believe so, try to convince your dad that it is not that you directly find the idea of religion to be 100% wrong its just that you want to find what you believe for yourself and that him forcing you to go to his church is a hindrance upon this.</p>

The purpose is to make him understand that you have your own beliefs and that you are mature enough to have a different opinion instead of a molded one, but you should at least try to show that, despite having a mind of your own, you are not becoming a monster.</p>

<p>Really though you should take and open minded approach on religion.  Although there is no direct 100% end all proof against it.  Just as REAL scientist do you must take an open mind and understand that concepts that you have come to believe must be taken lightly as “facts” are always changing as new information becomes available.  Don’t be a faithful atheist.  Don’t just read a book and take your ideals from that, go into the world talk to people, learn scientific things about why there couldn’t be a god (not a summation in depth about specifics such as the big bang).</p>
<p>If you do these things I am 100% sure your dad will stop forcing you to go to church, because you will be wiser from it.  Although not going to church shouldn’t be your goal it should be to become a more educated individual with a greater understanding of the people and world around them.</p>

<p>That is a nice idea if he has enough curiosity and if he is willing to spend his time. I honestly wouldn’t have patience to do it myself.</p>
