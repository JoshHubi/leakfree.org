    <title>Religious Argument</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/religious-argument/5565</link>
    <description>My dad&#39;s a Methodist preacher, has been since I was born. I&#39;d gone to church every Sunday up until about a year ago, even though I had already said I did not share his beliefs. He&#39;s been forcing religion on me. He&#39;s been a Christian for so long it&#39;s become part of him- he has a personality fixed upon his religion and refuses to believe otherwise, and maybe he can&#39;t believe otherwise, but this isn&#39;t about him. It&#39;s about me.  :stuck_out_tongue: 

I want to convince him to give me the freedom to believe what I want, and stop trying to force upon me what I find to be repulsive and incorrect. Anyway, I referenced &quot;The God Delusion,&quot; and that seemed to have made things worse. Apparently he&#39;s read it, proving my earlier point about his personality fixed religion. He &quot;remained firm in his faith&quot; even through reading this book, and I bet he went on a search right after for a book that scrutinized &quot;The God Delusion&quot; for affirmation of his religion, because that&#39;s like him. He wrote me this cute little note and made me sign:

It reads,
[quote]
I will review and critique the arguments presented in &quot;The God Delusion&quot; with my father of the next year. (YEAR?!) We will divide the book into &quot;installments&quot; and regularly confront Sir Dawkin&#39;s arguments. Failure to take this process seriously- keeping up with reading + writing assignments will result in denial of computer privileges.
[/quote]
He always brings computer in where it doesn&#39;t belong as a form of punishment. It&#39;s the only thing he has control over, computer use...

Anyway, help me help him help me by not forcing stupid religious beliefs. I need to be able to refute whatever he says, basically. I&#39;m almost positive he read a book that analyzes &quot;The God Delusion&quot; from a dimwit Christian perspective. (Also, any ideas for a loophole in that contract? It&#39;s not legally binding or anything but it could bite me in the ass later.)</description>

<p>If you want to further sway your father from believing you are ignorant, I would advise learning about non-christian religions.

<p>Even if you don’t believe so, try to convince your dad that it is not that you directly find the idea of religion to be 100% wrong its just that you want to find what you believe for yourself and that him forcing you to go to his church is a hindrance upon this.</p>

            <p>Protestantism basically stated the existence of predestination, only Luther didn’t like dealing with uncomfortable issues (thus the creation of protestantism) and just didn’t think about it. The idea was that one would do the works anyway because they were given the grace of God.</p>

<p>Protestants are predestination, catholics are based more on works. Your post is invalid.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>no they’re not</p>
<p>a few protestant approaches, like calvinism, did believe in predestination, but they also believed that the only way you could achieve the salvation you were destined to was to also achieve success in your earthly life, and since you couldn’t tell if you were one of the chosen ones predestined to salvation or not, you should always pursue your personal well-being.</p>
<p>catholics however believe that all humans are already destined to salvation, and their ideals largely incentive a life of submission and apathy</p>
<p>it’d be stupid if catholics believed in hard work while protestantism defended laziness when one of the main reasons protestantism got so popular at it’s time was to justify the ideals of the Bourgeoisie</p>

            <p>You are right, he is expecting an exact answer. In my opinion, you should frustrate his attempt by writing something showing that you know what he means, but you still disagrees with his side. It won’t work to deviate from the subject, you have to play the game in his terms.</p>
<p>I did not read this book, but I guess I know what he means by different types of gods. These are the bad gods:</p>
<ul>
<li>the one that gives money to the people who demands: there are lots of people that give lots of money to some church expecting to receive more money;</li>
<li>the one that makes miracles: some people pray expecting god to cure them from some disease or give them the love of their life or some material object.</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are the ones that he might thing as the real god:</p>
<ul>
<li>the one that guides people through the right way; in other words, the god that tells you what to do and punishes you if you don’t;</li>
<li>the one that loves people unconditionally and suffers with so much sin in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you have to do is make he understand that he can’t change your mind. For instance, I would put those four kind of gods in a paper and criticize all of them. The first and second are easy to criticize. The third is there to take away your freedom to find out what is right and wrong. The fourth was just conceived in human’s minds to express our own unhappiness against the state of the world and is pretty much useless.</p>

<p>Or at the very least, being mindful of religion has no lasting advantage. This makes it irrelevant to any reasonable decision-making process.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I disagree completely. As I have said, religion is not always bad. Having people with different opinion is <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> important to any decision-making process. If you put a bunch of people with same behavior and same beliefs in a room, they will all have more or less the same ideas. The conversation rarely goes very deep in the subject.</p>
<p>Now, remove half of the people from that room and put others that disagree with them. Everyone in that room will start to think much harder just to prove each other wrong. Better solutions to the problems will be given.</p>
<p>Why do they put 12 people in a jury and not just one or two? Because, with 12 people, the probability of people disagreeing with each other is much higher. They will throw arguments at each other until all of them is convinced of one thing: whether the defendant is guilty or not.</p>
<p>I usually have a contempt to people saying everything needs to be homogenized in some way. Religion is one of them. Good and bad things come from people of any religion because of their religion, and also good and bad things come from atheists because of their lack of religion. Eliminating all religions from Earth is like removing a leg. Then you will have to use a cane for the rest of the eternity.</p>

            <p>^ That makes it relevant, i.e. you can’t ignore religion because it can cause problems.</p>
<p>Relevant does not always mean positively relevant.</p>
<p>That said, religion in itself is not bad. The problem are people that misuse it to do “bad things”, either to obtain power or just because they are literally crazy. On the other side, there are a lot of NGOs formed mostly or even entirely by religion folks. All associations, organizations or whatever I’ve heard of are based on some religion.</p>
<p>Yes, I know religion usually obfuscate its participant’s own conscience and opinion, but it is also a very effective method to bring people together for a purpose that, in general, makes the society better.</p>

<p>This in itself makes it relevant. Its importance may have diminished, but it remains part of many of our (collective term for humanity) decision making processes.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What does it remain relevant to? Anything immediately affected by the acknowledgement of religion has the long-term effect of perpetuating religious violence, conflict, and discrimination.</p>
