    <title>Rare Specimen hat trouble</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rare-specimen-hat-trouble/13067</link>
    <description>I grabbed the hat from the cargo crate and now I&#39;m in the room with the giant teleporter column with numbered portals and rotating platforms.
The problem comes when I try to go through the portals with the hat. Whenever the hat goes through the first portal and lands on a platform, I can&#39;t pick it up. I can shoot it, and I can give it a good whack, but I cannot actually hold it unless it falls off the platform and onto the floor, at which point I can pick it up again. I have tried throwing it through the portal instead, I&#39;ve tried waiting a bit after I send it through before heading in myself, but I continue to have this problem.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>I managed to do it, but it’s tricky.  I believe jumping in sideways (so you and the hat pass through at the same time) can help you get the odds in your favor…</p>

            <p>Totally normal for the current version of BM. It will probably be easier in the next update, some people have managed to obtain the achievment in the current conditions, however.</p>
