    <title>Water wakes for on a rail and character</title>

    <description>It would be really cool if when in the water a realistic wake was left behind you. It would also be cool if when the tram in the episode On a Rail left a realistic wake behind it when it went through the water.</description>

            <p>I’m fairly certain that those “wakes” are custom particles, since env_splash is pretty awful to use for anything more than a simple splash.</p>
<p>You’d certainly need to do it via particle system if at all. And then it might not look all that convincing.</p>

            <p>The spinning reactor in Lambda Core has a nice little wake effect.  I’m not sure if it’s a custom particle, or if it involves an env_splash.</p>
<p>I like the idea, but Half-Life 2’s wake effects are quite limited and low-res.  Plus, since Gordon has no feet, what happens when you look down and move forward?  It’s one of those “if you can’t do it right, then should you do it at all?” things.</p>

            <p>Yeah I see what you are saying, it would also be cool though to have underwater effects for the weapons.</p>

            <p>Yes it would be cool, but is that even possible in the Source engine? I can imagine it could be done, sort of… but I think it would require a bunch of trickery and it might not look all that great.</p>
