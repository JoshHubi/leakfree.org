    <title>Possible glitch with the glock.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/possible-glitch-with-the-glock/10094</link>
    <description>I noticed that you can look down the barrel of the magnum but not the glock.
Dont know if this should be possible or not. Not a big deal anyway. Just wanted you to know just in case it is a bug.</description>

            <p>No, it’s made on purpouse: the issue of the Magnun iron sights was raised after the pre-release leaked video of last month, when people questioned about this feature. One of the developer, Raminator, said the Magmun and the crossbow were the only weapons capable of this.</p>
<p>Short answer: it’s not a glitch, it’s voluntary.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
