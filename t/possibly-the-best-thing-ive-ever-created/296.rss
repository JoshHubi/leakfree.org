    <description>I felt this deserved it&#39;s own thread. :fffuuu:

I&#39;ve been working on a film for the last 3 years, And now, The introduction has been done. (No. It didn&#39;t take me 3 years to make the introduction. It took me 5 months) The film is set for release in June 2010.

Special Thanks to:
Andrew Kramer
And
Alex Verlan

Song used:
Attack - Pearl Harbour Soundtrack.

<p>Oh yeah, I feel you. I was awake for 4 days in row making the first part, and 2 days making the second part… That’s why I don’t want to fix any mistakes for a while, But there WILL be an improved version.</p>

<p>It’s an introduction to my film. Nothing to do with Half Life. Although it is related to it in the teeniest way.</p>
