    <title>Game hangs when loading saved game! Please help!!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-hangs-when-loading-saved-game-please-help/10789</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing this game with no problem for about 6-8 hours worth over the past couple days. I have saved games, loaded those saved games, auto saved, loaded the auto saved games with no problems at all.

Today I went to play and none of my saved games will load, auto saved or manually saved. The bar comes up to load the game, it fills (abnormally fast) then it just freezes with a full loading bar. I cannot access the steam community showing it&#39;s frozen, and I can&#39;t alt-tab. I&#39;ve let it hang there for over 5 minutes so I am convinced it&#39;s not just loading super slowly for some reason.

I&#39;ve restarted steam, my computer, messed around in steam, made sure my SDK is up to date - pretty much everything I can think of.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.

I should note, my game has crashed maybe 3 times from me alt-tabbing while playing. Never before has the saved game become corrupt or anything, I&#39;ve been able to just reload the game and start playing again. So I don&#39;t think it has to do with the crashing. Because if it did, only that one saved game would be compromised right? Not all of them ranging back to auto saves from yesterday?</description>
