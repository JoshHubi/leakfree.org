    <description>I used the search, but i didn&#39;t find anything about this.And sorry for my worse english^^ So ...

i wonder if there will be some cool ... hmm i call them screen effects. For example in call of Duty 4, the screen flashes red at the sides to show you, that you&#39;re close to death. 

Some of this effects will be really great. But not effects, which will destroy the old HL gameplay (like flashbang effects in CS: Source).
I have seen some source mods that have this ingame. Where will it be nice to see some of this screen effects? HL:EP1 also got some of this, i think.

Theres a room which is really cold in the part &quot;Apprehension&quot; ... would be nice to see the edges of the screen to freeze. Or maybe when getting out of the Water, that there are some water drops on the screen (like in bioshock). There are many situations where something like would be great.

Wondering if theres something like this ingame^^</description>

<p>I didn’t say it should be made on old technology, whats the point of adding stuff like this in if it is not cognizant with the original, doesn’t make sense because of the way eyes work and is more a tribute to Crysis and friends than HL.</p>

<p>Who the fuck are you, anyway?</p>
<p>Just because using the word “cognizant” in a sentence makes your e-penis nice and hard doesn’t make you a badass.</p>
<p>The excuse “If it was in Half-Life it’ll be in Black Mesa.” is bullshit. Saying that is basically saying that tiny maps, shitty graphics, and death animations are all going to be in Black Mesa.</p>

            <p>Ok its not a poison but i tested it on the toxic waste in “Residue Processing” … you see an radiotion warning symbol to the left and the hev said to me “Warnung: Blutgifte diagnostiziert”. Maybe wrong but directly translated to english: “Warning: Blood gas detected” … and the screen shakes every 2 seconds and you loose HEv suit power.</p>
<p>It was just an suggestion to make this today boring sequence to somthing where you could say: Ok thats a source game.</p>

<p>None of the chemicals in Half Life 1 were poisonous, not even the barrels marked with the biohazard symbol. They were radioactive however.</p>
<p>The closest thing to a toxin in the Half Life series has been the poison headcrab bites, and they didn’t affect vision. Doing this in Black Mesa will break continuity.</p>

            <p>I’m still waiting for someone out there to do HDR with a retina texture so you properly get the “dots before your eyes” afterimage stuff after looking at a bright light like the sun…<br>
It shouldn’t be all that hard either, just replace the tonemap multiplier with a texture lookup, and apply a gradual fade down plus the clip from the tonemap process to it.  I’d even go so far as to make the up more sensitive towards the middle of the screen.<br>
That way, someone shining a light in your eyes would properly kill off night-vision too…</p>

            <p>Well its a game. I think it’s unimportant if gordon has glasses or eylenses or whatever.</p>
<p>I dont what to simulate realism with screen effects like water or somthing else… Years ago HL got me with his unbelievable atmosphere, grafics on my RivaTNT  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> … Now over 10 Years later, there is the source engine. I saw screen effects in HL like the nuke explosion when you trapped into a tripmine in surface tension. Or like the flashing behind this room full of tripmines after an airstrike. There was not more room for detailed effects like they exist today.<br>
The water drips where only an suggestion. Still thinking about the teleport sequence in HL2. There where Lighning effects and much more. Im not speaking about to see this in Bm but it will <span class="bbcode-i">maybe</span> improve the atmosphere when its well used.</p>

            <p>That whole “it wasn’t in HL1” line only works when you talking about adding elements that would dramatically effect gameplay and the story line. I don’t see how star-bursting effects being emited from light sources would do that. With your kind of logic I suppose BM should be developed with the Gldsrc engine and use identical effects to the original. BM is not a copy and paste job, if it was, it wouldn’t have taken five years. The devs are trying to make a reproduction with their own creative reimagining while still respecting VALVe’s original work.</p>

            <p>It’d be similar to a bloom effect. I imagine it would be a shader effect, in particular, so the texture tells the game what to display on what part of the texture.</p>

<p>That’d be a <span class="bbcode-i">great</span> name for a garage band:  Gordon Freeman’s Eyelashes.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">And, by “great”, I mean, “stupid”.  :retard:</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>But, I don’t know what kind of performance hit these effects would have and whether they are worth it.  Perhaps if there was an option for enabling/disabling them…?</p>

            <p>Actually.  There is one game that has an absolutely brilliant lighting effect in it that is exactly what you described, and it works very well.  It is Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth.  When you look at a light, it blurs in diagonal directions <a href="https://img.hexus.net/v2/gaming/screenshots/call3_large.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">such as in the top right corner of this picture</a>. I think it looks bloody awesome and improves atmosphere by a lot.  Of course, it is likely too late to code something like this in BM, but hey. The idea is out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lens flares only happen with cameras.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is only partially true.  Or perhaps it depends on the person’s eyes.  For me, I get “starburst” effects in my eyes when a bright light is next to dark light (such as looking at a streetlamp at night).  And I get would could be considered lens flares as well…sorta.</p>
<p>If a bright light is shining directly into my eyes at night, not only do I see the starburst, but I can see a “reflection” of the light, too.  For example:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1960af3e74973a9349bae213c7c7091d7425189c.jpeg" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/1960af3e74973a9349bae213c7c7091d7425189c" title=""><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1960af3e74973a9349bae213c7c7091d7425189c.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="3Cv56VuImFPSXdqrcl40uaHmHrC" width="281" height="500" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/1960af3e74973a9349bae213c7c7091d7425189c_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">337×599 8.95 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>If I were looking at the bright light here, I’d only see one “reflection” (a single orange circle outside the light source).</p>
<p>Perhaps my eyes are just fucked?  I do have floaters and sometimes I see pinpricks of lights after a strenuous activity.  Hmmm…</p>
