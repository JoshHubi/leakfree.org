    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-i-just-got-robbed/11712</link>
    <description>I am a cashier in internet cafe and my shift time is from 12 PM to 8 AM, at the around 5 AM. I got robbed by three malay with machete.

I gave up the money without resistance and thankfully I am out of harm.

But it gave me quite of shock of my life as it is my first time getting robbed.</description>

            <p>Oh yeah, at the last day of work today. I was plain pissed off at one guy owe me 15 buck(in Malaysian currency)</p>
<p>While he is returning me money, he didn’t like the way I speak and looked at him and he just goes.</p>
<p>“You talk properly, you don’t talk to me like that. You want me bang you right here? I can bang you right here and what you gonna do? Call lawyer?” I basically just glare at him and says stab him but it was too noise for him to heard what I said.</p>
<p>I am so glad I stop working at place like that</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I got beaten up a couple of months ago. Im 18, these guys were about my age. There were 3 of them. Baically I was walking down the road in daylight with many cars on the road but these idiots decided they wanted a fight. One kid pushed his mate into me, I confronted them “Watch it!”.</p>
<p>To be fair they did say do you wanna come down this street (it was quiet with no-one) and fight… I basically just carried on walking when he said that im not stupid.</p>
<p>Then they started laughing and calling my “pussy” etc. so I turned back (reacted… badly) around and shouted at them “There’s three of you and one of me, you couldn’t take me on your own you fucking pussy” - this is my fault I think… so yeah they all decided to punch/kick the shit out of me until some guy skidded his car onto the path (it was a wide path) and open his door. They jumped back and stopped. I looked at him then back to the three guys and they everyone basically said “leave it” so I just carried on walking to my bus stop.</p>
<p>I had glasses which at the time I felt were precious enough to take up a hand meaning I could hardly defend myself. I have contact lenses now  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I was in pain for 3 days but after that completely fine, it turned out they were complete pussies because their punches must have been real weak… I managed to walk upright with no limp straight after the fight - winded for 3 days and hurt but no real damage.</p>
<p>edit: Oh and yeah, Fong, I’m glad you’re ok!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Fine. Wall o’ text incoming</p>
<p>I had to film a local football team working out and make a couple of interviews before an important match took place (it’s going to be played tomorrow) as an assignment for uni.</p>
<p>This workout session was originally going to be in another place , but it started raining heavily the night before so they had to move to another part of town, called Bajo Flores. In regular circumstances I wouldn’t go there because it’s known as a hellhole -it almost overlaps with one of the biggest and most dangerous <span class="bbcode-i">villa miserias</span> around here, called the 1-11-14, full of drug dealers and some of the worst scum you can think of- but as we had to do this project ASAP we didn’t have lots of options to reschedule. (by the way, this happened at 9.30 in the morning; I though it would be safer because of that, but that shows what I know. I had never gone to this place before).</p>
<p>Earlier that morning, we had taken a cab with a friend, a cameraman, and -obviously- the cabdriver. I was sitting in the front seat; the other two guys were in the back seats. After about 30 minutes, we were really near our destination. We couldn’t find the entrance to the place where the players were training, though we could see them through the metal mesh that surrounded the football fields.</p>
<p>We had asked a passerby and he told us there was a gate on the opposite end of the sports complex. Just as we turned around the corner, we saw that there were a lot of houses built on the dirt street, made of wood, scrap metal and cardboard. I didn’t like what I saw so I told the cabdriver to turn around, but he didn’t (later he told me that the dirt had turned to mud because of the rain and he didn’t want to get stuck in that place).</p>
<p>Two guys appeared out of nowhere, one dressed in green, and the other one wearing a yellow raincoat. I don’t know how, but the guy in the raincoat was suddenly just 10 meters away from us. He pulled out a gun, cocked it (this was all during a split second), and just as he pointed it at me (because I was in the front seat), the cab driver stepped full throttle and hit him with the rightmost part of the front of the car. We didn’t look back, so I don’t know if the guy stood up or did anything after that.</p>
<p>I just know that I always thought I would do this or that if I was in a similar situation, but I just froze, the time seemed to slow down (I remember everything in some sort of slow motion movie), and I didn’t even manage to take cover or anything.</p>

            <p>I was in a cab today and we ended up in a really rough part of town (they’re called ‘villa miseria’).</p>
<p>A guy suddenly came out of nowhere, pulled out a gun and aimed  it right at me. The cab driver just stepped full throttle and ran him over.</p>

<p>Just keep it simple: If a robber is, well, robbing you, they have to be close enough to the counter to get the money. That obviously means you get a Revolutionary-War era replica rifle and bayonet the guy.</p>

</aside>
<p>Technically you’d want a spear or maybe a pike for that. A bayoneted rifle is only useful if you plan on actually using the gun, otherwise it’s just superfluous.</p>
<p>A spear, on the other hand, is designed for <span class="bbcode-i">exactly</span> what you’re describing. And the best part is, if the robber has a gun, it just becomes a small-scale historical reenactment.</p>

            <p>Personally, if I had to pick an unorthodox weapon to carry around, I’d go with a (small) sword of some variety. Damascus steel would be nice just because it looks cool.</p>
