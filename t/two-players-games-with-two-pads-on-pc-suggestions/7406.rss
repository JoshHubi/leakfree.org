    <title>Two players games with two pads on PC suggestions?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/two-players-games-with-two-pads-on-pc-suggestions/7406</link>
    <description>Hey guys and gals. It&#39;s me again.. :3
Since my last thread turned into the lair of nasty off-topic and ragefest, let me introduce you to this new one.  :wink:  This time I basically need some suggestions for two players games utilising two pads. I have Xbox360 pad and some old Trust wireless pad (Sight Fighter Wireless). Not sure if it&#39;s even possible for them both to work simultaneously so lets throw anything you&#39;ve got on your mind here. I have Xpadder if it might help. I&#39;m out of ideas..</description>
