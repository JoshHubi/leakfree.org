            <p>Half-Life was perfectly fine the way it was. That didn’t stop anyone from completely re-fucking-doing the entire thing.</p>
<p>I just don’t see how someone that enjoyed the first one so much wouldn’t be psyched for a revisualization. Especially when there’s a button that lets you toggle between old and new graphics in real-time. It’s the exact same game it was in 2001.</p>

            <p>I played sports. I did things outside. I was a kid dammit. What im trying to say is that it existed during my childhood and I had a lot of good times with that game. It didnt consume my childhood but it was a part of it like im sure Atari and Donkey Kong was for other people. Im saying it was perfectly fine just the way it was.</p>

            <p>Yeah what the fuck? Every day I see someone parading around the internet, and sometimes in person boasting about how their entire youth consisted of consuming shitty cartoons and video games.</p>
<p>Why the fuck didn’t your parents hit you, or make you play sports or something</p>

            <p>It’s not a gritty reboot, you curmudgeon. It’s hardly even a remake.<br>
Check out the screenshots. It’s the same purple and green stuff it’s always been, but with the juicy, chunkified characteristics of any generic modern-day videogame</p>

            <p>Halo 1 doesnt need a gritty reboot. Remember when they tried that with Goldeneye? As for Halo 4, my first thought when Microsoft announced it at E3 was “Cool story, bro”. Don’t get me wrong, I love the series. But id feel more comfortable letting Reach being the last entry in a series that encompasses most of my childhood. Besides, what the he’ll does Chief hope to accomplish on Onyx? If youve read the book, you know the answer: nothing.</p>

<p>I gotta agree there. That last Arbiter level felt like the first level of any other shooter.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I stopped playing multiplayer period on the 360 anyway, mostly because I refused to pay for Gold. Halo 3’s multiplayer seems more ‘done’ than the story. I enjoyed the campaign, it just felt like it was just included because the other Halo games had one. Though I’d be lying if I didn’t think some of the story moments were pretty cool. But I haven’t played it in a while (nor any other Halo game for that matter) so my opinion may change whenever I play it again.</p>

<p>I think the point Dias was trying to make was that Halo’s single player felt like it came up short, whereas most of the love shown for the game was due to its multiplayer. Thus, the implication is that more effort was spent upon multiplayer development than the campaign. So, his preference being for story-based single player games, he would give Halo a second chance if a game in the series were to lack a multiplayer component, because it would suggest to him that the single player could be good because it was the sole focus of development.</p>

<p>Actually, though, this has already happened; ODST was single player only - the multiplayer from Halo 3 was carried over until Reach came out. But, ODST did not seem to be significantly more well-received than any of the other games. So Halo is probably just not a series you’ll ever get into.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I only played the PC port of the first Halo &amp; I thought it was meh. The levels were very repetitive, the story was pretty weak, the driving bits (namely the ending) weren’t fun &amp; the physics was strange &amp; floaty. Every time I hear about how ‘good’ Halo or most of the popular FPS’ on the 360, it’s always about the multiplayer.</p>
<p>If there’s ever a Halo game developed without any multiplayer, then I’ll pre-order it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I’d like the Halo games a lot more if they had better foley for the guns,</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">True, but Halo reach sounds fucking great all around. You should reload with the guns in that game and give em a listen. Good shit.</span></span></p>
<p>had a checkpoint system that actually works to the point of being able to shut down the console and not lose eight hours of progress, which was a holdover from Halo 1 and should have been fixed by now.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">What kind of asshole just turns their console off before going “SAVE and quit”?</span></span></p>
<p>Also, the writing veers between stupid and pretentious, the plots range from predictable to impenetrably complex, and generally the game plays to extremes.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">In Reach and 3 they just kinda throw you the story and run away. It doesn’t quite unfold like it should. Halo 1, 2, and ODST had very well done campaign stories imo.</span></span></p>
<p>Also, the online community has a lot of assholes.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">They’ve mostly migrated to COD when MW2 came out. Now games like Gears and Halo are actually playable. </span></span></p>
<p>They’re decent games by all means, but I’ve played far better.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">imo, there’s no such thing as a “best” game, so I can’t really comment on this. It just seems twisted to me. Why can’t two good games coexist on the shelf of one player? If you own good stuff play it.</span></span></p>
<p>Am I missing anything?</p>

<p>reports say they’ve reworked the library somewhat for the reissue. Still giddy that you can press the back button and it reverts to the original graphics.</p>
<p>Anyway 343 has this quirk where every so often, they’ll gruseomely fuck the art style of Halo. Take the sleek cosmetic and aesthetic charms you’d find in the bungie-designed content and turn it into thick, chunky roundedness that shares nothing with the original design but overall silhouette and color scheme. See the CG segments of Halo Legends.<br>
I don’t hate their new take on what I assume is still supposed to be Mk. 6 armor from the end of Halo 3, the one Chief would be wearing in the teaser trailer. It’s just so drastically different from what I know Mk. 6 is supposed to look like.<br>
My hypothesis is that maybe 343 is using the model as a placeholder for the Halo 2/3 armor, and that the one featured in the trailer is actually Mark 7 or something that you’d receive at some point in the game.</p>
<p>Don’t honestly care all that much, It doesn’t look all that ugly when you analyze it, (I like the upper body and visor shape, myself) and I know I’ll probably grow to prefer it. Nothing looks as good as the original 2001 design, IMO.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I actually like 343’s MKVI more than Bungie’s. It’s bulkier build makes it look like a more natural progression from the MK V. Especially since, if you think about it, the Halo 2/3 MKVI are way too god damn skinny to fit a proportionate person in them, much less a genetically enhanced muscly bruiser.</p>

<p>Halo 4 thoughts: Idgaf about the 4… I’m still wondering why they didn’t move on to a different game/series</p>
<p>Halo4 = Graphics better, moar alienz, bigger war, BOOM new halo game, fans will buy the shit.</p>
<p>Halo and Cod. Very similiar.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Halo actually changes quite a bit from installment to installment. Halo 2 felt like a completely different game than Halo 1, and Halo 3 felt completely different than Halo 2. The weapons never handle the same way twice. Hell, from Halo 1 to Reach the same weapon has NEVER been repeated (with the exception of ODST); all the guns that “return” just have the same name, but always behave drastically different than when they were last seen. Features get implemented and others get removed. Halo 2/3 is much more linear than 1/reach. ODST was laid out more like Spyro the Dragon with it’s open hub world with portals that lead to linear levels.</p>
<p>I know you’re trying desperately to be the cool nonconformist guy here by actively posting in a thread about a game you don’t give a fuck about, but make sure when you say something against the series it holds at least a <span class="bbcode-i">bit</span> of water. Have a go at it’s generic (now retro and therefore ‘in’) art style or campy voice acting instead. Halo pretty much goes through a COD :II to COD :IV caliber change with every release.</p>

            <p>I think the only other popular Xbox exclusive was Mass Effect, and that exclusivity ship sailed with Mass Effect 2. Look at the PS3. They’ve got shit tons more really good PS3 exclusive titles.</p>

<p>Assuming you didn’t know this based on your comment, Bungie <span class="bbcode-i">has</span> moved on to another game series with Activision, Microsoft has not. It’d also be entirely foolish of Microsoft to let their flagship title from the original console just disappear.</p>
<p>I agree that the 360 needs a new, well-done exclusive though.</p>
