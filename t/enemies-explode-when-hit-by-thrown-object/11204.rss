    <title>Enemies explode when hit by thrown object</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/enemies-explode-when-hit-by-thrown-object/11204</link>
    <description>I noticed that you can hurt HECUs by throwing a regular grey barrel at them (I don&#39;t know if other objects work) and if you kill him this way, he explodes as if killed by large explosion. This is funny and weird, and should be fixed  :slight_smile:  I don&#39;t know if this works with other enemies.

I got the same effect by killing a vort with a chair (I had to throw it at him like 15 times). That proves that it works for all enemies and all objects.</description>
