            <p>While I’m at it, has anyone not noticed my black text on my other post in this thread?</p>
<p>Anyhow I’m hoping that the Ichthyosaur is going to be as pants-crapping as it was in Half-Life. I still am somewhat scared of that thing to this date! It has always so tricky to defeat too, because I can’t see underwater from above.</p>

            <p>The whole mod looks amazing</p>
<p>I think the chapter I find most iconic in the original half life, and am therefore looking forward to the most in BMS, is either Blast Pit (<em>clang</em> <em>clang</em> <em>clang</em>) or Apprehension. I await both of these eagerly</p>

            <p>OaR looks pretty nice.  But I’d probably say that about any footage I saw.  So realistically, Lambda Core?  Just a really fun chapter.  Particularly, the whole sequence of getting to the little room with the shotgun scientist and the security guard.  I loved those two.  They really were the only characters in Half-Life 1 that I had any emotional connection with.  It made me feel like I really was the only person who could stop everything.  And kind of sad that they probably didn’t make it out alive.  And the teleporter sequence is awesome too.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that little area before the Nihilanth was a lot of fun too.  It wasn’t a real chapter and was just called “Xen” when you saved there.  The mood and pressure where really intense.  Especially when you got up to the Nihilanth’s telelporter thingy at the end and you can hear all of the scientist’s voices in the background.  Really eery.</p>
<p>So yeah, those two.  My fingers hurt now from typing all that.</p>
