    <title>Occupy Wall Street Opinion Thread. What is your perspective?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/occupy-wall-street-opinion-thread-what-is-your-perspective/7945</link>
    <description>So Occupy Wall Street has been going on for over 20 days today. (10/7/2011) On top of the protesters growing in numbers in York City itself, the message (Once a unified message is constructed) is spreading across the states to multiple cities like Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, Seattle, Washington D.C., Chicago, and it continues on to add up to a total of 872 gatherings nationwide.( [url]https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-20117291-501465.html[/url] )

   The bases from what I can see from my own personal perspective is a message that corporatism has corrupted our politics, has crashed our economy, and many feel that essentially the &quot;top 1%&quot; hog all of the money. (And have been able to continue doing so due in part of the big Bailouts provided by the Federal Government which everyone in the country is paying for out of their tax dollars.) 

   A war deemed by the media as &quot;Class Warfare&quot; and a war worth fighting by many Americans (and I hope the rest of the world) has begun. 

  The question is, will this be enough to straighten out those who are public servants to this country or will the message die out? Will Corporations collapse under their own corruption and NOT be bailed out by the Federal Government this time?  

  My hope... 

     I would hope that after keeping up on the protests since day 1 and seeing so many people with different opinions in a movement that is leaderless. A unified message will emerge to re-paint the picture of a way this country is run. Without big money in the Public Servant department, and if a company is on the line of going bankrupt let Capitalism take it&#39;s course and the corporation sink to the deepest parts of the Atlantic.      

    What is your perspective on the situation? How does this effect or not effect you?</description>

<p>I appreciate Romney’s “we can’t afford to run from science” viewpoint.  In my eyes, it makes him the giant among midgets.</p>
<p>EDIT: So someone challenged me on the above quote in a private message, and I went back to look it up, and it turns out it was Jon Huntsman who said that, not Mitt Romney.  I’m not sure why I thought it was him.  So fuck Mitt Romney.</p>

<li>To hold Wall Street and lenders accountable for their actions that directly led to the economic meltdown</li>
<li>To spur a national conversation regarding actions that are deleterious to the economy</li>
<li>To force government’s hand to start helping the economy by doing things such as tax increases (or at least elimination of the tax cuts that were supposed to be temporary anyway) that will help do things like spur innovation, increase spending on infrastructure which will, in turn, create jobs.</li>
<li>As said in point 3: Create jobs.  OWS wants people to go to work if they want to work.  They want a jobs program such as WPA.  Increasing spending on infrastructure will increase jobs.  Temporarily increasing spending on things such as “entitlement” programs will increase jobs.</li>

<p>OWS is not about stopping people from being rich.  In fact, if we do what OWS wants, people will continue to be rich.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Republicans are all for tax breaks for the rich, so do you really think they give a shit about what these people are protesting about?  If anything, under the Republicans the rich will get much richer.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, the Republicans might allow the rich to get richer by allowing them to not have to pay for what they use, but they got rich because of us: the consumers.</p>
<p>If you help the consumers, whether it’s someone in the “great unwashed masses” or a small business, then the rich will get richer.  As the adage says: A rising tide raises all boats.  Anchoring the boats of the poor and middle class will cause the rising tide to harm people that are at the bottom.  That is what has been happening for the past quarter of a century.</p>
<p>If you help the drivers of the economy, they will be even richer.  Despite OWS wants.</p>
<p>Remember:  OWS doesn’t want the rich to stop being rich.</p>

            <p>Difference between the anti-war protest of February 15, 2003 and the occupy protests is the amount of time. The anti-war protest only lasted a weekend, and the occupy protest has been going on for 48 days. On top of that it continues to grow and keeps going strong around the world.</p>
<p>Maybe the quality of this protest out weighs the quantity of the 2003 protest. I’m not saying anything will come of this, I’m just pointing out the difference in light of the details.</p>

            <p>People should protest if they feel there is something worth protesting, just don’t expect anything to come of it.</p>
<p>As I said in my earlier post;  It’s good that they are at least trying.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is a complete waste of time and will change nothing at all.<br>
The rich want to stay rich and there’s no way they’ll let a small group of people stop them.  Do you think they are scared, sitting up in their high castles drinking their wine?  Not at all.<br>
Hell, next election Obama is getting replaced by Republicans.  Republicans are all for tax breaks for the rich, so do you really think they give a shit about what these people are protesting about?  If anything, under the Republicans the rich will get much richer.</p>

            <p>In February 2003 around 10 million people took part in a global protest against going to war in Iraq.<br>
That’s TEN MILLION!</p>
<p>How many governments paid attention to the people they were supposed to represent?<br>
I’m pretty sure you could say that there was a national dialogue then too.<br>
In Rome there were 3 million protester; the largest protest ever.</p>
<p>I’m just saying, the governments didn’t give a shit about 10 million people so why would they give a shit about several thousand people protesting a problem which is much harder to solve.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">Bankers are afraid of stock and shares falling.<br>
Bankers are not afraid of hippies and drum circles.</span></p>
<p>While I think it is better to try and fail at something than not try at all, I really cannot see these protesters achieving anything through this protest.<br>
What annoys me are that many of these protesters are ‘professional protesters’.  They don’t know or care what they’re protesting, they just have to “fight the man” and simply get a hard-on over protesting.<br>
It trivializes the whole thing when you have people camping out because they think it will be cool and like a festival.</p>

<p>Not that I know of, but protesters I heard were protesting to try and get the Mayor of Oakland to resign.</p>
<p>The officer and everyone above him in his chain of command need to be punished on some level.</p>

</aside>
<p>For the third time you claim I want the opposite of what I stated. I am all about not using force (actually I believe I said this four times now). If you want government benefits like protection then YOU ARE FREE TO DO SO. The problem is, I HAVE NO CHOICE IN IT. I have to pay for all those benefits EVEN if I don’t want them! That means I am forced to do something against my will.</p>

<p>So you admit you’re wrong? And what do you mean by <span class="bbcode-i">not always</span>. Does that mean every single person involved in building the road is working on government payroll?

</aside>
<p>And here you make the same mistake, again, fifth time now. I have to tell you (again) that I am against initiating force. When will you understand the following god damn line I keep posting:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">It’s all about not using force. I want FREEDOM, both individually and economically. So that I can better my life in the way I see fit. Without using force and/or interfering with the freedom of another.</span></p>
<p>That means, if you want to pay government to ‘protect’ you or give you benefits THEN FEEL FREE TO DO SO! I AM NOT AGAINST THAT. As long as the individual can decide for himself/herself whether or not he/she wants to receive any benefits/protection or not. If someone doesn’t want these benefits, then they shouldn’t have to pay for them! You are the one who is using force if you want people to pay for benefits they don’t even want.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s there, in fact Friedman made a whole episode (Free to Choose Ep.1) about these things including the exact topic you just mentioned. This was a topic I was actually interested in too seeing how it’s something you have no control over the quality of the air. But I have a feeling you will never watch any it seeing how I have to repeat myself over and over again.</p>

<p>The taxpayers would pay for the failure of those corporations anyway.  And have to pay more.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Uh in a free market if a corporation does bad then it will go bankrupt, only big government backed up by keynesian theory can bail out corporations with tax payers money. Government is the only one to blame here. Without government stepping in, those corporations/banks or w/e would go down just like unsuccessful species in nature go extinct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No.  Because, without government to be there to break up monopolies, businesses would naturally form monopolies by swallowing up the competition.  There would only be one oil company.  There would only be one fast food joint.  There would only be one car manufacturer.  And so on.  We see it happening all the time with one business buying another.  Microsoft recently bought Skype, for instance.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So you’re back on monopolies again. I thought we covered this already.  Microsoft receives a lot of government support through tax benefits (so do companies like Intel). Friedman explained beautifully how in almost all cases the monopolies that survive the longest are the ones backed up government. Take railroads, steel industry, big agriculture. List goes on and on. Did I mention that excessive regulation protects Microsoft from competition? Their huge capital allows them to build a legal wall around them that you can’t do shit against unless you yourself represent a large corporation (see Apple vs. Samsung). Someone actually asked Friedman how to prevent those monopolies in a free market, after explaining what I said above he said “just look at Hong Kong (freest economy in the world), where are those big evil monopolies you were talking about?”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Companies are sitting on piles of cash but they’re not hiring (evidently the “tax rates” they’re paying aren’t hurting them in that department).  Why?  There’s no reason to.  Why would a business hire people if there’s nothing for them to do?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They’re not hiring because it’s too expensive/risky to hire people. Companies are drowning in regulation and taxes, it’s small business that suffers most from this. This is why you have such big corporations, the small guy can’t get started and become big himself! Schiff explains his own situation with his company and hiring people for it in one of his vids but I’m have trouble finding it. Will post when I have it. Government actually fined him for trying to expand his business and hire more people. He was forced to outsource the jobs. Due to excessive taxing and regulation he would not have been able to start his company at this date. According to him he employs 150 people.</p>

<p>The questions then becomes, how could you get corporations to build roads without government intervention?

It’s just like government taxation, except that the people are free to chose whether or not they want to pay for the construction of a road they may or may not use. That ability to choose is what Milton Friedman was all about, why do you think his show is called ‘Free to Choose’?</p>

<p>You are telling the person in the boonies that he’s not allowed to have electricity because the government is not allowed to spend your money to build lines to him.  Even though in doing so, you are helped by his increased productivity.  You say that there’s not enough demand to lay lines (or roads) out to the person.  This “free market” has now initiated force against the person.</p>
<p>Also, tell me what I can do, without government protection, against a company that spews pollutants into the air and I’m forced, even though I’m not a customer, to breathe that shit in, causing me health problems?</p>
<p>Where’s the free market solution here?</p>

<p>To be honest I disagree with taxing those who earn more money. Don’t forget that there are people who have earned their money and have kept their business afloat legitimately.</p>
<p>The issue is those corporations that were bailed out because of the “Too big to fail” mentality. Those corporations should have gone under but government stepped in and dumped the debt onto everyone here in America. So the tax payers are paying for the failure of those corporations that should have gone under.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The taxpayers would pay for the failure of those corporations anyway.  And have to pay more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a true capitalistic system wouldn’t we have recovered by other businesses meeting the need that those corporations failed at?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No.  Because, without government to be there to break up monopolies, businesses would naturally form monopolies by swallowing up the competition.  There would only be one oil company.  There would only be one fast food joint.  There would only be one car manufacturer.  And so on.  We see it happening all the time with one business buying another.  Microsoft recently bought Skype, for instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the solution would be now, I honestly don’t know. But taxing the “rich” is really an unfair solution.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The reason we’re saying ‘tax the rich’ is because they’re getting a virtual free ride on our backs.  Yes, they pay, in dollars, more than us, but they also control, in dollars, more than us.   Also, “the rich” are the recipients of our hard work.  Why shouldn’t they have to pay for this?</p>
<p>Companies are sitting on piles of cash but they’re not hiring (evidently the “tax rates” they’re paying aren’t hurting them in that department).  Why?  There’s no reason to.  Why would a business hire people if there’s nothing for them to do?</p>
