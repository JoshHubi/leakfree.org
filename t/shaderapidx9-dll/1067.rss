    <title>shaderapidx9.dll....</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shaderapidx9-dll/1067</link>
    <description>Ok, now this is making me crazy....i get some kind of weird error when i want to
start HL2 Episode 1 or HL2 Episode 2. Steam tries to start the game and i get the message from windows that the application has crashed and the reason seems
to be &quot;shaderapidx9.dll&quot;. This has never happened to me, i didnt changed my system or drivers, so what is causing this error all of a sudden? Ive googled through the net and people seem to have this same error, but i couldnt fix it so far!
It only happens to Episode 1 and 2, it doesnt occur when i want to start Half Life 2!
Any ideas how to fix this?</description>

            <p>Re-installing works 90% of the time. Also verify the integrity of your game files. I don’t know what it does, but it sounds like it might help.</p>

            <p>Have you tried de-frag the caches, perhaps its missing, maybe a re-install.</p>
