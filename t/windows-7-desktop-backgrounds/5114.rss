    <title>Windows 7 desktop backgrounds</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-7-desktop-backgrounds/5114</link>
    <description>Hey, you know that wonderful feature that lets you dump a bunch of images into a folder then windows 7 will cycle through those images as your desktop background, well I was wondering if it was possible to assign a key that lets you change to the next image on shuffle, because right click/left click isn&#39;t working for me. cheers</description>
