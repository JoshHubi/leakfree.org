    <title>How to make a vmt file for a custom glock skin</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-make-a-vmt-file-for-a-custom-glock-skin/62640</link>
    <description>I have a custom texture for the Glock, but it only shows for a few seconds after I fire the Glock. I know I can fix this by screwing around with a vmt file, but I&#39;m inexperienced with them because I mainly make TF2 skins, which don&#39;t require a vmt file. Also, I&#39;m on Steam. TL;DR, I need some help making a vmt file for the Glock, I&#39;m on the Steam version.</description>

            <p>I don’t know. It’s a good tool for generating them, but I don’t know what to add to make it show the skin all the time</p>

            <p>I don’t know a thing about how Source works in any game. But maybe Nem’s tools can help with autogenerating the correct vmt file?</p>
