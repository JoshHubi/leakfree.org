    <description>Hey everyone,

So its finally time to get rid of my old iMac, and I&#39;ve been wondering what I should get.  I&#39;ll be using the computer predominantly for gaming, audio production, some usage of photoshop and GIMP amongst various other general usage.

Heres what I have in mind so far:

I&#39;ll be using it predominantly for gaming, music production, some art production, and watching films and other general usage.

Heres what I have so far:

Asus Crosshair IV Formula AMD 890FX AM3 Motherboard
AMD CPU Phenom II 1090T Black Edition Six Core Processor
Sapphire HD 6850 Toxic ATI - AMD Radeon Graphics Card - 1GB
Corsair Memory XMS3 Classic 8GB DDR3 1600 MHz CAS 9 XMP Dual Channel Desktop
2TB Hitachi 0F12115 DeskStar 7K3000 3.5&quot; SATA 6Gbps 7200rpm 64MB Cache
Coolermaster HAF 922 Black Mid Tower Computer Chassis
Edimax EW-7728IN / PCI Wireless N WiFi Card / 300mbps / 802.11n
LG DVD Writer, GH22NS50, SATA, Black, OEM

So far this comes up to around 740 GBP, or 1189 USD.

However, I still don&#39;t know what PSU I should use, as its my first build and I&#39;m not entirely sure as to how I should calculate the correct voltage/watts.

Advice would be much appreciated.

Cheers  :slight_smile:</description>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">RAID</a> is included in all P8P67 motherboards, so no extra cost. If you set up a RAID0 array you can use all the space on the disks, read and write speeds will be almost double compared to just one drive. But if one drive crashes, you loose all your data. That is why I choose RAID1 in my computer, at the cost of hard drive space.</p>

            <p>Ok I’ll have a look at alternative 2x1tb options, and I’ll check the RAM ratings.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll get an SSD in the future.  Not now though, its outside my price range.</p>
<p>Edit: Damn those Samsung Spinpoints look amazing.  2 of them are even cheaper and faster than just the 1 Hitachi.  I’m definitely getting a pair, thanks for the advice.</p>

DVD-RW<br>
Corsair HX 750w modular PSU</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Looks pretty good. Make sure the RAM is rated @ 1.5v because that is the new sandy bridge standard and also if i were you i would forget about the 2TB drive and get 2x1TB instead(like the awesome Samsung Spinpoint F3)</p>

            <p>EDIT - Sorry was replying to an earlier post. The info is still good though.</p>
<p>Actually the i5-2500 is still faster than the 1090T the OP was looking at and the i7-2600 is about 30% faster. AMD just don’t have anything that will compete in the same price range.</p>
<p>If it will fit into your budget an SSD is a good idea but not if you have to compromise elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Well if you are going to overclock(or just want your PC to be more quet) you should get a better cooler for the CPU and if the 932 isn’t much more i think you should go with that. Also the fixed motherboards have a huge B3!!111one!! sticker on them to make sure you know they are fixed. Also if you really want a quet PC i think you should look into Fractal Desing Define R3. It’s the best case in it’s price range(about $100)</p>

            <p>Ok thanks.  I’ve looked around and the only thing that the sabertooth seems to have is this heat shield, which to me just seems like it’ll attract a lot of dust.</p>
<p>Also, how would I know if its the fixed version when ordering it?  I imagine the company won’t send out broken ones though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>OK, so now I’ll be having an i5-2500k and a P8P67 Pro, with a Sapphire Toxic HD Radeon 6850, 8GB DDR3 1600mhz dual channel RAM and a cooler master HAF 922…  As regards to cooling, should I buy seperate cooler for the CPU?  Or maybe just dish out the few pounds extra to have all of the optional fans installed on the 922?</p>
<p>Edit: Now thinking of the 932. Its not much more, but seems to have a lot more cooling potential and more space.</p>

<p>AFAIK the Pro is better than the Sabertooth</p>
<p>EDIT: Also if it makes any difference i ordered the Pro version (still waiting for delivery, but that is because noone has those fixed boards in stock ATM)</p>

            <p>“I’ll be using the computer predominantly for gaming, audio production, some usage of photoshop and GIMP amongst various other general usage.”</p>
<p>In light of this, 'tis better to have 6 true cores than 4 cores with virtualization.  For folks that use programs capable of proper multithreading, such as Photoshop, CAD, etc, the AMD X6’s are generally a better bet.  If you’re just gaming, fine, go with an i5 or i7, but with both budget and multithreading in mind, go with AMD.</p>
<p>Also, I second the Corsair 750 HX or TX (depends if you want modular cables).  750 isn’t really overkill - for the price/watt ratio, and the safety of headroom (don’t forget about wattage spikes) it’s fine to get a 750 instead of 600.  Especially if you add a second GPU or overclock.</p>
<p>In short - AMD should be fine, the Corsair 750 is the way to go, and having a SSD boot drive (even if you get say, a 60GB ) makes a BIG difference.  My machine boots to Windows in ~7 seconds (no, that’s not a BM: S “when it’s done” 7, but a true 7  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ).  And file transfers are sooo fast, I usually get 175-200MB/s (Corsair F-series 120).</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice all.</p>
<p>As regards to the 750w PSU, I was going for that in case I ever decided to grab another GPU later on in the future, in Crossfire.</p>
<p>Also, I’ll look into SSDs, see how much they are.  I assume I’d just have windows booting on the SSD, and all the files on the HDD (with the exception of a game or two I guess)?</p>
<p>I’ve heard mixed reviews about the SandyBridge range.  They look alright, but I’ve also heard that they have various issues with a lot of hardware and software?  Also the 1090t is meant to be insanely good at overclocking as well.</p>
<p>Edit: Looked some more into them, and they’re looking like a much more attractive choice.  Very similar price ranges as well for the i5-2500k.  Only thing I’m worried about is:</p>
<p>“<strong>Please note: Intel Sandybridge SATA Issue on P67 and H67 Motherboards.<br>
There is NO Issue with Sandybridge Processors (CPU’s). Only Motherboards are potentially affected.<br>
Devices connected to SATA Ports 0 &amp; 1 or Using the SATAIII (6Gb/s) Ports are not affected.</strong>”</p>

<p>Thanks! I heard that the 6850 was easy to overclock and I thought about maybe adding another later on, in CrossFire. But maybe I’ll go for a smaller PSU.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yes, I also recommend an SSD drive for Windows. SSD rocks!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I will also get a new computer soon. This will be my new setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asus P8P67 motherboard</li>
<li>Core i7-2600 processor</li>
<li>Asus HD 6850 graphics card</li>
<li>Kingston HyperX 8Gb DDR3 @ 1600 MHz</li>
<li>2x Corsair Nova 32 Gb SSD in RAID0 (read speed about 380 mb/s  :rolleyes: )</li>
<li>2x WD 2TB HDD in RAID1 + my old 1 TB drive for storage</li>
<li>Nexus Prominent 5 case</li>
<li>Nexus 850W PSU</li>
<li>DVDRW</li>
</ul>

            <p>Imo, putting this much money in the PC. Add a solid state drive (or add other drives to go raid). The SSD REALLY speeds up the computer while in the windows format, and makes your life so much easier  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, people wondering about his choice of 2TB, the price / GByte is very low, and totally worth it. Like he said, eventually he will run out of space anyway.</p>

            <p>Unless you spend a fortune on a 2TB drive they are usually slower than a 1TB drive running at 5400rpm instead of 7200rpm. A lot of people will say the difference isn’t noticeable but I’ve had both speeds and I can notice the difference.</p>
<p>750w for a single GPU setup is overkill by a long way. 500-600w will be plenty from a good brand such as Corsair, Antec, Coolermaster or OCZ (there are others),</p>
<p>CPU and mobo wise there is little point now going for anything other than the Sandybridge range especially considering your budget. The i5-2500k with a P67 motherboard will kick the shit out of anything AMD at the moment especially if you overclock. Make sure your RAM will run at 1.5v as 1.65v is out of spec according to intel.</p>
<p>If you really want to buy AMD I suggest waiting until the Summer as they are due to bring out their new Bulldozer APU’s for performance desktops. Until then unless you are looking for a low budget build it’s just not sensible to go AMD.</p>

            <p>Well, I’ve had a look around, and my favourite PSU so far is this one: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=17-139-010&amp;SortField=0&amp;SummaryType=0&amp;Pagesize=10&amp;PurchaseMark=&amp;SelectedRating=-1&amp;VideoOnlyMark=False&amp;VendorMark=&amp;IsFeedbackTab=true&amp;Page=2#scrollFullInfo" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=17-139-010&amp;SortField=0&amp;SummaryType=0&amp;Pagesize=10&amp;PurchaseMark=&amp;SelectedRating=-1&amp;VideoOnlyMark=False&amp;VendorMark=&amp;IsFeedbackTab=true&amp;Page=2#scrollFullInfo</a></p>
<p>Anyway, bobbo, do you mean an SSD?  Aren’t those very expensive?  If its boot time, I’m not really concerned about that, seeing as my routine is to hit the power button, then go downstairs for a few minutes and make myself a coffee.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Also I actually do have another HDD… Well an external.  I’m running most of my steam games off a 1TB external via symlinks at the moment, as this iMac’s HD is pretty small.</p>

            <p>If you want a 750W PSU, like the Antec TP750W</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371025&amp;cm_re=antec_tp-750--17-371-025--Product" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371025&amp;cm_re=antec_tp-750-<em>-17-371-025-</em>-Product</a></p>
<p>By the way, you should use Newegg when you search for you computer gear. I don’t really know much about PSU’s, I just got the Antec TP750W in my comp so I suggested it lol, look up the Corsair Enthusiast on Newegg and see what people say about it. Look around and think before you choose things for your computer, don’t just get stuff because other people say so.</p>
