    <description>I have Source 2007 + 2006 + SDK installed but when I play the game, it freezes and crashes during the reasonace casade part.. I also have GMod, but I didn&#39;t have it installed then. Is Gmod okay to use for BMS?
I have some pictures of the command console that said something about not being able to create gibs or xenians and ALOT of erros.</description>
