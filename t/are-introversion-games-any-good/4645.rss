    <title>Are Introversion games any good?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/are-introversion-games-any-good/4645</link>
    <description>So today Steam has a sale on an Introversion game pack (Darwinia, Defcon, Multiwinia, etc.) for $5, and I am very inclined to take the offer because I liked Defcon. But are the other games any good? Any personal experiences?  Are the multiplayer servers still active?  Thanks..feel free to discuss freely.</description>

            <p>I already own Defcon, so my decision’s hinging on Darwinia mostly.  Anyone else have any words about that?  Oh, and yes I’ll try the demo.</p>

            <p>Try the demo, of course.</p>
<p>Darwinia was fun for a while.  Then again, it may be more fun to play on the PC version that is probably FAR more optimized.</p>

            <p>I dunno, but I got Half Life today for $2 in today’s sale, so SWEET. Steam’s awesome sales are one of the main reasons I love it so much.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you like Defcon already I’d say why not? You get all the games for half the price of Defcon alone, so it’s a freaking good deal. Even if you were only going to get Defcon alone for $5 you’d still be getting a good deal. So I’d say go ahead, and if the other games aren’t good then you won’t feel so bad cuz you hardly paid anything for them. The only reason I’d advise you wait for response is if you already own Defcon, in which case you’d want to know if the other games are good, because if they aren’t, you won’t be getting anything good out of it that you don’t already own.</p>
<p>EDIT: Based on the metascores alone they all look to be pretty good. Darwinia and Defcon both have 84s, Multiwinia has 76 and Uplink has 75.</p>
