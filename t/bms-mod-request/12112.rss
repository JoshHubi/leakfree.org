    <title>BMS MOD REQUEST</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bms-mod-request/12112</link>
    <description>Basically; this is just a simple coding or rather kind of a copy past; a really upped version of 6 weapons; Pack-a-punched in a way. What is just needed is to add a copy of &quot;.cpp&quot; files, and upload the bin, DLL, or the cache that comes with it and works on an ordinary black mesa once placed in. if possible with a few new coding;

1.) weapon_exbow - weapon_crossbow; a version of crossbow with semi-auto version.
** if possible; allow the damage, rate of fire, and bolt airspeed to be easily modded through the console.

2.) weapon_714 - weapon_357; a version of 357 magnum that fires MP5 grenades, at a very high-speed; almost instantly hits anything or any same effects.
** if possible; allow the damage, projectile throw force, and explosion radius to be easily modded through the console.

3.) weapon_gkey - weapon_glock; a version of glock handgun that fires a 357 magnum round. nothing new but an automatic fire-speed; 400 rpm.
** if possible; allow the rate of fire and damage to be easily modded through the console.

4.) weapon_mp5000 - Weapon_mp5; a version of MP5 that fires-tau powered rounds, basically runs non-charged beams of tau lasers. Secondary fires unguided rpg rocket.
** if possible; allow the rate of fire, separate beam damage, rocket airspeed, radius, and damage to be easily modded through the console.

5.) weapon_shotcannon - Weapon _shotgun; a version of shotgun that fires 8 RPG rounds at the same cone at random points, secondary fire shoots 16 rockets.
** if possible; allow the number of rockets, AOE and damage to be easily modded through the console.

6.) weapon_flash - weapon_rpg; has 4 round clip and fires at 300 rpm at semi-automatic. secondary function remains.

If you cannot modify the functions, just the files from BMS that allows to have 6 new weapons under the names are okay;

weapon_714
weapon_gkey
weapon_mp5000
weapon_exbow
weapon_shotcannon
weapon_flash

Thanks for everything ^_^ Also, this is NOT for the future of BMS, i&#39;m just kinda asking if any of the readers can spare time to make a mod that can be placed in BMS.</description>

            <p>202 lines, much  more manageable, yeah.</p>
<p>It’s not to code a new weapon, it’s to replace the crowbar with a hatchet and buff the damage accordingly. I’d probably also have to change the damage type to SLASH instead of BLUNT.</p>

<p>Plus, there’s the fact that C++ gets compiled. So, basically, unless someone is a master at reverse engineering DLLs (I never met a person who could), no one’s getting any custom weapons.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not sure if this is a necro bump, so if it is, I apologize.</p>
<p>As a programmer on the team with a considerable amount of reverse engineering experience, there is no way you could reverse engineer the game binaries and add new weapons. Source generates a bunch of code each time we add a new weapon and there is no way to ‘tack on’ extra code. You’d physically have to modify the binary…which requires the source code  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Also, not new behaviors entirely. the Shotcannon might be new, but it just spawns RPG rockets in a cone, basically like a rocket shotgun. The MP5000 fires tau rounds; basically just beams from the tau from the barrel and fires RPG rocket instead of it’s usual grenade rounds. GKey is just a new automatic version of the Glock, the EXBow is just a faster version, and the FLASH is just a four rounded rpg that fires in semi-auto and can lead up to 4 rockets in a time. In the hind-side, yes i have no idea how to code in BMS and barely at GMOD and i’am sorry if i seem cocky to dub this simple. But i have a different experience in coding so i felt “easy” to me under the circumstance that i know how to tinker with the codes of the source engine. You might say that “But you don’t know how to”, but i’m just looking it in the perspective of someone who do.</p>

<p>Several of these would involve making the weapons change from hitscan to actual projectiles or vice versa. It’s probably a lot more complicated than you think.</p>

<p>Plus, there’s the fact that C++ gets compiled. So, basically, unless someone is a master at reverse engineering DLLs (I never met a person who could), no one’s getting any custom weapons.</p>

<p>Garry’s Mod uses Lua script for all of those addons. Black Mesa doesn’t, it uses the basic Source 2007 code which I believe is in C++. It wouldn’t be nearly as simple as you think it is.</p>

<p>No, this would NOT be a “simple” coding thing. That’s six new weapons. Even if you re-used the models of the old ones, you’d probably have to recompile them all to fit the new projectiles being used, code in the new projectiles and their behavior, etc.</p>
<p>It would be a pain in the ass and it wouldn’t benefit the game except for you. I highly doubt something like this would get added.</p>

<p>Yeah, kinda aware, but with a “copy paste” of weapon functions much like a SWEP. I was thinking of the weapon’s coding much like a SWEP from GMOD.</p>
<p>Anyways, it’s a personal request not to the developers but only to someone who is willing to and people who can. Not a lot of people, but certainly with 8billion people in the planet, one might try. and if other people are interested, they can enjoy this mod too.</p>
<p>Also, not new behaviors entirely. the Shotcannon might be new, but it just spawns RPG rockets in a cone, basically like a rocket shotgun. The MP5000 fires tau rounds; basically just beams from the tau from the barrel and fires RPG rocket instead of it’s usual grenade rounds. GKey is just a new automatic version of the Glock, the EXBow is just a faster version, and the FLASH is just a four rounded rpg that fires in semi-auto and can lead up to 4 rockets in a time. In the hind-side, yes i have no idea how to code in BMS and barely at GMOD and i’am sorry if i seem cocky to dub this simple. But i have a different experience in coding so i felt “easy” to me under the circumstance that i know how to tinker with the codes of the source engine. You might say that “But you don’t know how to”, but i’m just looking it in the perspective of someone who do.</p>
<p>Lastly, you didn’t read the original post right; what i was asking first is ONLY to make copies of separate weapon entities in the game. The new weapon functions i asked is; if the one who would do it is generous.</p>

            <p>Well, that was the point; “Pack-a-Punched” like the COD zombies… anyways i was just requesting… for fun…</p>
<p>I always wanted these kinds of weapon in GMOD or SMOD, but i just don’t know how to do them. And BMS is such an awesome mod that i find it best for BMS. Now just waiting for a great endless zombie arena map, a big one too.</p>

            <p>Basically; this is just a simple coding or rather kind of a copy past; a really upped version of 6 weapons; Pack-a-punched in a way. What is just needed is to add a copy of “.cpp” files, and upload the bin, DLL, or the cache that comes with it and works on an ordinary black mesa once placed in. if possible with a few new coding;</p>
<p>1.) weapon_exbow - weapon_crossbow; a version of crossbow with semi-auto version.<br>
** if possible; allow the damage, rate of fire, and bolt airspeed to be easily modded through the console.</p>
<p>2.) weapon_714 - weapon_357; a version of 357 magnum that fires MP5 grenades, at a very high-speed; almost instantly hits anything or any same effects.<br>
** if possible; allow the damage, projectile throw force, and explosion radius to be easily modded through the console.</p>
<p>3.) weapon_gkey - weapon_glock; a version of glock handgun that fires a 357 magnum round. nothing new but an automatic fire-speed; 400 rpm.<br>
** if possible; allow the rate of fire and damage to be easily modded through the console.</p>
<p>4.) weapon_mp5000 - Weapon_mp5; a version of MP5 that fires-tau powered rounds, basically runs non-charged beams of tau lasers. Secondary fires unguided rpg rocket.<br>
** if possible; allow the rate of fire, separate beam damage, rocket airspeed, radius, and damage to be easily modded through the console.</p>
<p>5.) weapon_shotcannon - Weapon _shotgun; a version of shotgun that fires 8 RPG rounds at the same cone at random points, secondary fire shoots 16 rockets.<br>
** if possible; allow the number of rockets, AOE and damage to be easily modded through the console.</p>
<p>6.) weapon_flash - weapon_rpg; has 4 round clip and fires at 300 rpm at semi-automatic. secondary function remains.</p>
<p>If you cannot modify the functions, just the files from BMS that allows to have 6 new weapons under the names are okay;</p>
<p>weapon_714<br>
weapon_gkey<br>
weapon_mp5000<br>
weapon_exbow<br>
weapon_shotcannon<br>
weapon_flash</p>
<p>Thanks for everything <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Also, this is NOT for the future of BMS, i’m just kinda asking if any of the readers can spare time to make a mod that can be placed in BMS.</p>
