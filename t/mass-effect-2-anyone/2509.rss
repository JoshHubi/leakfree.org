            <p>I just have a question about Mass Effect 2.  Hopefully somebody here will be able to answer so I don’t have to go over to EA…</p>
<p>I have to reinstall my OS (finally upgrading from the RC).  When I reinstall the game and try to connect to cerberus, will I just be able to input the EA account that I used to buy access with and will it let me back in?</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, in the Garrus mission, during pretty much the entire sniping session…  It’s as if (were it source) they used the nodraw texture instead of a… skybox.  Making everything get echoed when it passed in front of it.  Through the window, that make it look like some sort of blur.  Really wierd, and probably just an oversight when making it look like it was a certain time of day.  Probably referenced something they forgot to actually put in.</p>

            <p>I noticed one other glitch I seem to be regularly having. At the end of Garrus’s loyalty mission, after you’re leaving Harkin, the shuttle just pops into view without you and Garrus being replaced by scenery. Then this weird ghosting will come off and on during the rest of the mission. Not totally bizarre but it is rather distracting. In the words of Joker it makes it “look like a dream sequence” lol</p>

            <p>Just be careful about cutting corners or running into corners, or just about anything having to do with corners.  There’s a chance you’ll end up on top of the world.  Sometimes you can fall back in, but other times you just get stuck up there.  I think it happened… 4 times.  The worst was on my way through the facility with Jack to blow it up, I got caught up on one of the support beams in the last room before hers.</p>

<p>Well, except for the loading screens, but at least those are better than hour long elevator rides.</p>

</aside>
<p>I just replaced my 512mb 8800gt with a 1gb 4890, and although the new card runs games at higher fps, the elevator load times in ME2 are really long now, like 30 sec, as opposed to the &lt;1sec to 2 second times I had before. Anyone with ATI see long elevator rides? Anyone with nVidia see short ones? Wondering if it’s tied to the cards or something else going on.</p>

<p>EDIT: Garrus is a romance option for Shepard…female Shepard that is, which is why it looks kind of off. Someone either shopped male Shepard in or replaced the model. It’s pretty funny either way lol.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’ve noticed a number of strange bugs during the game. Theres mundane stuff like Joker’s arm floating above his armrest, to moderately odd stuff like glitching through an invisible wall and ending up 20 feet in the air or Shepard turning sideways while in shooting mode, but I can’t recall anything as strange as your glitch.</p>

            <p>I’m having this really weird bugg.</p>
<p>I decided to do a second playthrough. I borrowed the cd to a friend, so I installed a no cd patch cuz I couldn’t wait. Dunno if that has something to do with it.</p>
<p>Anyway, after the first mission, you have to spend your first squad points. As soon as you do that the door opens and you can move on. However, I don’t have any squad points!<br>
I redid the mission too, but it didn’t work. Anyone have an idea about what’s up?</p>

            <p>Yeah, lets just hope they don’t pull a Bungie, Halo 1 and 2 available on PC, HAHYOUCAN’THAVEHALO3!!!</p>
<p>On-topic:  With the number of people that could have died in ME2… God they’re gonna have to do a lot of line recording.  And story writing.  And event scripting.  It’ll be like…  three games’ worth of content.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed the PC version sells. EA canceled the PC version of Dead Space 2, and I’m afraid that they might do the same with ME3.</p>

</aside>
<p>I doubt Bioware would make the game for console only. PC is the birthplace of Bioware’s fan base. That is like suggesting ID’s next 3d shooter will be console only.</p>

            <p>Dead space felt like it was missing a portion of it’s epicness on consoles…  Things just didn’t look right.  Maybe it’s because I love my computer, but I think it’s a mistake for any game company to cut PC’s from their plans.</p>

<p>I agree.  Especially with Garrus.  He was always my favorite.  I like Doc, and Grunt also though. Grunt is a damage shield.  He really comes in handy during my current play through on hardcore.  Those Heavy Mechs are pretty freaking strong at that difficulty level.</p>

            <p>I kept everybody alive, I just hope I get to keep everybody.  I’d understand if Thane didn’t carry over, as, for all we know, the next game might take place a year later, but things seem more imminent (if that makes sense) at the end of ME2 than ME1.<br>
Zaeed prolly won’t cuz he sucks and is a DLC.</p>
<p>More than anything, I demand they keep Tali and Garrus.  I’m sure they will, because they seem to be the two solids in the ME universe.</p>
<p>Based on their attitudes at the end of the game (even if you make the renegade choice in regards to the facility), Miranda and…  er…  That other cerberus officer…  Sound like they would stay, but who knows.  Mr. Illusive Man might have some splodey-implants in their necks.  That would make for interesting cutscenes…  Juicy.</p>
<p>Legion always talks like he is going to have to go back to the Geth collective soon, but I sincerely hope he remains for Mass Effect 3.  The rest, I really couldn’t give a damn about.  The justicar probably would stay, but because you can loose her in favor of another bitch who definitely WOULDN’T stay, I bet they’ll come up with some reason for her to be busy doing something.  But now I’m just stating crap about everybody, and that wasn’t the point of this post.</p>
<p>I think it was:  Tali, Garrus, and Legion better stay.</p>

<p>I did. I was quite impressed he could sing that well considering he can’t speak in complete sentences lol.</p>

<p>My reaction was more like, “Holy shit.” In a good way though.</p>
<p>Also, Legion rules. Wish we could get him earlier  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> .</p>
