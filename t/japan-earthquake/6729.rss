</aside>
<p>Right - but a lot of Americans are nationalists - if you criticize  their country in any way, they take it personally. We like to think that our government exercises the will of the people, and the actions of the government regarding military actions and foreign policy that some people here are criticizing  are emphatically supported by about half the population. So, if you criticize those policies or actions, about half of America will take it personally (and likely call you a terrorist).</p>
<p>BTW - American Exceptionalism isn’t just a vague ideological plank used to guide foreign policy -  it is embraced by about half of Americans as a personal philosophy that defines America itself. To those people, if you don’t embrace American Exceptionalism, you aren’t a ‘real’ American (and will likely be called a ‘Terrorist’ or accused of ‘Treason’.)</p>
<p>I’m not saying that Winged One or anyone else is one of these people. He may have just misunderstood the criticism or has some other reason for taking it personally.</p>
<p>I wasn’t taking issue with his post. I just thought that the exchange was an interesting misunderstanding, and I had a thought inspired by it and made that comment.</p>
<p>But let’s be clear: No one, including me, is saying that “All Americans are douchebags”, or “Mr. X is an American, therefore Mr. X is a douchebag.”</p>

            <p>Douchebag is an entirely relative term, decided by ones own views of how one should act, as you said yourself. Fact is, US has just as many as many other nations in the world.</p>

<p>OK - so you just have that one perspective.</p>
<p>It’s hard to get a good perspective from the inside. You know your own culture and society, but you don’t have anything which to compare it.</p>

<p>All I wanted to argue was that we aren’t douchebags like most of the world claims.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you asked a thousand people from different parts of the world their opinion of the US, most of them wouldn’t be as negative as you may think, and I doubt any of them would use the term ‘douchebag’ (which is a good fuckin word in general BTW).</p>
<p>But forget about the rest of the world. If you asked Americans this specific question:</p>
<p>Are we douchebags?</p>
<p>I suspect that those that watch FOX News, listen to Rush Limbaugh, etc, would, in general, respond, "Yes, about 50% of Americans are douchebags.</p>
<p>And those that watch The Daily Show, Colbert Report, read NYT, HuffPo, etc, would, in general,  respond “Yes, about 50% of Americans are douchebags.”</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t know if I would say that 50% of us are douchebags, but let’s face it, it seems like the percentage of douchebags in the American population is greater than the percentage of douchebags in the general world population. In other words, we have more than our share of douchebags.</p>
<p>It seems to be a cultural thing - we excel at douchebaggery. We’ve elevated it to an art form. We celebrate it. We love douchebags. We elevate them to the status of heroes. We give them wealth and power, fame and fortune We exempt them from law and taxes. We regard them as the pinnacle of our society. They run the joint and we emulate them.</p>
<p>The real definition of a hero isn’t a fireman who rescues a family from a burning building, it’s someone that embodies the ideals of a culture. Look at who our real heroes are - douchebags. They’re a reflection of our culture by definition.</p>
<p>It’s ridiculous to say that someone is a douchebag because they’re American. But it’s a douchebag culture and a douchebag society.</p>
