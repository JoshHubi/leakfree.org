    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-happened/4195</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always wanted to know where the combine came from, Ever sence I played Half-Life 2 there has been two questions lurking in my mind: &quot;Where did the combine come from?&quot; and &quot;What the hell happened between HL1 and HL2.

I know about the 7 Hour war and Earth&#39;s surrender but nothing else. I just can&#39;t find info on it.</description>

            <p>I think it is so easy!<br>
G-Man moves gordon over the time. Portals are time-position gates that can used for time travel too. But in other hand i think G-Man have a better solution for traveling into time-position then Human and Combine portals!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve also wanted to know what happened between the end of HL1 to the beginning of HL2. I know the G-man put him there, but what did Gordon do before that? The combine’s invasion is clear to me, more or less.</p>

</aside>
<p>Before Half Life 1: Gordon was born and raised in Seattle.  He grew up with an interest in theoretical physics and went to MIT under the tutelage of Dr. Kleiner.  Then he went to be a fellow at the University of Innsbruck before getting hired  on (by a reference from Kleiner) at the Black Mesa Research Facility.  He was there for a bit, becoming friends with Barney Calhoun, a security guard.  A crystalline sample is brought to the facility and…Half Life 1.</p>
<p>After Nihilanth is killed, Gordon is placed in stasis by the G-man and portal storms are unleashed on the planet, bringing all sorts of fun with it.  The Combine, who had been pursuing the creatures of Xen and a currently-unnamed planet, took notice of the portal storms on Earth, using it as a way to conquer Earth.  Seven hours later, the administrator of the Black Mesa Research Facility facilitates a surrender of Earth.  Combine take over Earth.</p>
<p>Some time later, Gordon is brought out of stasis and…Half Life 2.</p>
<p>Does that help any?</p>

            <p>The OP asked about the plot of the HL universe, specifically what happened after BM and before Gordon woke.  Mist really does not answer any questions regarding HL.</p>
<p>Besides the 7 hour war and earth’s surrender, I think everything else is left to speculation until Valve fills in the blanks.</p>
