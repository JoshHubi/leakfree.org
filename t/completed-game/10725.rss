            <p>You could always just leave your saves and use this command to unlock the new chapters.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sv_unlockedchapters 15</code></pre>

            <p>Oh, true that. I guess I’ll probs still keep a save just in case, but yeah, it will most likely be better to start again. Hopefully some bugs will have been fixed, too.</p>

            <p>I’m playing it through from the start, I don’t recommend keeping your saves for a future version because they probably won’t work properly since savegames hate changes in the level.</p>
