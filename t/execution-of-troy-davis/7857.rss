        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The fact is some people quite simply don’t deserve to live. You can be as liberal and open minded as you want but it’l never change them. Your mercy and self righteous moral compass doesn’t mean shit to some people, and they’d take you for everything you have if given the chance.</p>
<p>The death penalty should be used in extreme cases only, with prisoners who confess and show no remorse what so ever. It shouldn’t be used in order to protect government face or protect the justification and means to apply the law itself.</p>
<p>People need to be realistic. Humanity doesn’t have time for dealing with murdering scum, society leaves enough people behind already, lets not leave more behind because we’re busy dealing with people who either aren’t evolved enough to have the empathy to realise the effects of their actions, or simply don’t care.</p>
<p>If people confess, show no remorse and are clearly psychotic, have them taken to a jail cell, studied and have them killed within a month.</p>
<p>Damn that does start to sound harsh by the end, even to me.</p>

            <p>Regarding “Pleading guilty”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Look, John. You’re going to the prison anyway. You will be there for a lifetime. But the<br>
cops are still hot on our trails for the murder of the butcher on Main street. If you admit to that murder as well, I promise you, that the Capone family will take care of your wife and children. They will never have to worry about home or food. I promise.”<br>
(later)</li>
<li>“Your highness, he pleaded guilty! That’s a proof he did it! Execute him!”</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding “Death Penalty”</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The costs of Death penalty are higher than costs of life-time imprisonment. (There goes your “it’s a drain on resources”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One would think that 9/11 was a proof enough that people from certain backgrounds are not hard to convince to sacrifice themselves in order to assure “better life” for themselves or their beloved (those related to the suicide flyers improved their social status significantly). As shown in the example at the beginning, pleading guilty may just be a way to help your relatives if you think their situation is desperate. Look around you and think: How many fathers from poorer families around you would be able to sacrifice themselves by accepting non-painful death penalty if it ensured that their children would be fed, would have where to live etc.? 1 in thousand? 10 in thousand? 100 in thousand?<br>
For those of us who don’t have their family values totally fucked up, sacrificing for our children is surprisingly easily acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Death Penalty in the USA<br>
Now this is then taken to the absolute extreme. You commit a crime out of poverty, illiteracy, under-education, social exclusion and gang influence. You are caught. They put you on trial and sentence you to die. But there’s a whole bunch of procedures which has to take place before the execution can take place, so you have 20 years in prison before the actual sentence is carried out. So you start educating yourself, you read books, you get qualification, you “grow up” from the civilization point of view… You are basically a different person by the time all the paperwork has been done. And THEN they strike. They chain you to a chair and run electricity through you to fry your brain.<br>
A lot has been told about injustice in China, Iran and other countries, but at least they don’t linger with death penalty for 20 bloody years. ZOMG.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>from a societal pov, the best thing is always what benefits humanity most, no?

            <p>I’m just saying that while it happening ever is terrible, its also inevitable. In a system effectively run by the people, you cannot expect that biases and prejudice will not affect the outcome from time to time. However, its the best system we and a species have, and it functions well.<br>
The number of pardons are tiny compared to the number of convictions, and as great if it would be if there was never a false conviction, thats out of the question.</p>

<p>Not really. That money goes to appeals, which are designed to prevent incorrect convictions, which happen anyway. There really aren’t any reason to keep the death penalty beside the idea of revenge, and the justice system should be above that.</p>

            <p>Not when people, even serial killers, continue to have rights under the US Constitution (as long as we’re talking about the US, that is) and that no one, without exception, has the right to life and liberty except for when it’s taken away by the due process of law.  One may not like it, but it actually protects (or should) those falsely accused of crimes that warrant a death penalty sentence.</p>
<p>And, yes, innocents have been put to death and, afterwards, evidence has come out to say, hey, that person didn’t do it.</p>

            <p>I never said any of that, I was trying to tell him that if he thinks murder is wrong, then why does he want to use it on other people who have committed a murder. ‘drawing a line’ is pointless because it’s all based on emotion. Just think of the times when they hanged or burned people because they thought they were witches.</p>
