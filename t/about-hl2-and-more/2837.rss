    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/about-hl2-and-more/2837</link>
    <description>to Valve

Nobody understands what you are trying to do by deferring HL2-Eposide Tree.  The COD series and your wrong attitude about timing, has long caused the game to be forgotten. You are destroying a legend by your own hands. If it was released as a series  “HL2-3-4”, as it was done for COD, surely no other game would be played around the globe.

Thanks to you, that’s not happening.

<p>Speaking of Black Mesa, it is a nice example. They could have released shit at the end of 2009, but I’d rather see they releasing something worth its weight in gold :awesome: (at least I hope so  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ), even if that takes one more year to get done.</p>

            <p>Cool story bro.</p>
<p>I don’t see how a longer release is killing the Half Life name. I believe it is making it stronger. I sounds like you are BAWWing over the longer relase, so I’ll make this quick. A longer development time = more awesome game. They are finishing the HL2 story arc, give them a break. Would you want EP3 now in the forum of a buggy mess or wait for it to be perfect, whenever that may be?</p>

            <p>I just think you guys are taking the delay of HL2-EP3 too seriously. No, seriously, it is actually a good thing that they are taking so long.</p>
<p>One problem that I thought about the first 2 episodes is that they are too short. You can barely start the game, you already finished it… twice, and… :’( it is over.</p>
<p>Valve will only be to blame if the third episode turn out to be small and without nice new features. In other words, wait for HL2-EP3, and, if it is shit, then get angry. In the mean time, play other games, like crysis, CoD 6, or even another genre of game, whatever you didn’t play yet and you would like to. Just wait a few months and play Black Mesa  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  Or just get a life  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Speaking of Black Mesa, it is a nice example. They could have released shit at the end of 2009, but I’d rather see they releasing something worth its weight in gold :awesome: (at least I hope so  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ), even if that takes one more year to get done.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to offend, but, if you think you can do better, drop a “curriculum vitae” at Valve’s address, maybe you can help them  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>And, no flame wars intended, but I love CoD. It has a very different game play compared to HL, and both games are nice. Feel free to be contrary to my opinion.</p>

            <p>to Valve</p>
<p>Nobody understands what you are trying to do by deferring HL2-Eposide Tree.  The COD series and your wrong attitude about timing, has long caused the game to be forgotten. You are destroying a legend by your own hands. If it was released as a series  “HL2-3-4”, as it was done for COD, surely no other game would be played around the globe.</p>
<p>Thanks to you, that’s not happening.<br>
