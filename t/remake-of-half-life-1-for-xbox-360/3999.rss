            <p>See I have this game on pc and have beaten it at least 14 times since i first played it as a kid…but ima console gamer 360 all the way and many of my friends are the same with either not having a good enough computer or preferring a console…most kids these days prefer a console and as such are missing out on a keystone to their gaming and as such it is a must for Valve to re-release Half-Life on the box as well as Opposing Force…Blue shift sure even though it was kinda crappy but they could do a “Grey box” to represent the whole old thing and have like half life, OF, BS, TFC,HLDM, and Cs. The classics that im sure all of us used to and still do play</p>

            <p>PC controls are better because you can customize them more, have more accuracy when aiming, look around faster, buy a fancy mouse with extra buttons, and have access to more buttons. The one disadvantage is it is not quite as easy, but still pretty easy, to sit on a couch and play (put the keyboard in your lap and the mouse+mousepad on the arm of the couch). But if you really want a controller go plug it into your pc. Or just go buy a pc, it’s better anyway.</p>
<p>Consolefags talk about how expensive pc gaming is when I’m sure a lot of them have family computers good enough to play games like Half-Life 2, which, though not the cutting edge of gaming, are still more fun than the majority of next gen games. My dad’s EIGHT year old computer can play HL2 Ep2 on low settings easily and the game doesn’t even look that bad on low settings.</p>

            <p>I’ll admit, there is a certain feel to using a controller. For me it’s old, and familiar, since I started out playing SMW, Super Metroid, and Goldeneye 007. But I prefer the ease of movement and the control a PC gives. After all, I don’t like having to use two joysticks or hold a couple of buttons and just a joystick just to look up.</p>

            <p>Ok I haven’t read all of this through, I’m about 3 pages in and I will say, I got Half life for the PS2. It’s not bad, and if you don’t like the controller you can always switch it out for a mouse and keyboard combo. The game is compatable as it says on the box. heck I bought a cheap keyboard and use a spare mouse for mine. It works fine.</p>

<p>Idk. I feel controlling movement in FPSs is much better with a joystick where you can gauge your speed depending on how far you tilt it. Plus everything is easier to reach.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I feel controlling movement in FPSs is much better with a mouse because you have absolute control over how fast you move your mouse, and are not constrained to a limited range of speeds, and you can actually feel what you are doing, because it isn’t just your thumb turning your character, your whole hand is.  Plus, I can snap a 90 degree corner in zero seconds flat.  The only downside is when it comes to recording video, I might actually use a controller to get some smooth movements…</p>

<p>Not really. That rule only applies to console platformers, but not to other games.</p>

<p>Idk. I feel controlling movement in FPSs is much better with a joystick where you can gauge your speed depending on how far you tilt it. Plus everything is easier to reach.</p>

            <p>Also, if you wanna think about aiming with a controller vs aiming with a mouse, ask yourself this - if the controller was better why would almost every console fps game come with some form of auto aim (tracking your enemy/locking on) while there is no auto aim on pc games (well, some have it but nobody uses it)</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this, such as sniping in metal gear - but that’s supposed to be more realistic. Which if anyone played the first metal gear solid, remember trying to snipe without diazepam? It was like trying to aim a bb gun while your friend is constantly pushing your gun away as hard as he could.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Well, the mouse is. The controller is better for character movement. If only there was a way to mix the two.</p>

“my pc sucks balls lol […]”</p>
<p>But then you say:<br>
“[…] i wunna play this mod”</p>
<p>You know that you need a PC that is able to run Source Games (Half Life 2, CS: S, etc.) in order to play this mod?</p>
