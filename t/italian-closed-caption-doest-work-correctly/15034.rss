    <title>Italian Closed Caption - does&#39;t work correctly!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/italian-closed-caption-doest-work-correctly/15034</link>
    <description>Hi!

I found a strange bug in the game:
When i selected the Italian Closed Captions, the game should have &quot;all&quot; the translated subtitles in Italian, but instead this does not happen
(even for the Inbound &quot;Tram Vox voice and the overhead announcements&quot;; Instead i have only subtitles for dialogues, as if &quot;Subtitles
(dialog only)&quot; had selected.)!

here are some examples:

Thanks!  :smiley:</description>
