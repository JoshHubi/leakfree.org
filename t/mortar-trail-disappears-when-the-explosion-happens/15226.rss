    <title>Mortar Trail disappears when the explosion happens</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mortar-trail-disappears-when-the-explosion-happens/15226</link>

Maybe a coder should set the mortar entity to do the explosion and remove itself after say 10 seconds, so the trail has time to fade away?</description>
