    <title>Music/ambience during loading screens?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/music-ambience-during-loading-screens/14949</link>
    <description>Does Source support pre-loading music so that it continues/plays through loading screens?  It completely breaks the immersion when there&#39;s an ambient track and suddenly it just stops because you hit a loading screen.  This is very noticeable in the tram ride; it&#39;s bad enough that everything suddenly freezes in place, but it&#39;s somehow worse that the ambience halts as well.

It especially sucks if you&#39;re really digging the track and you inadvertently move into a loading area.</description>

type in the console command 'play “[sound filename goes here]”.</p>
<p>So in theory you could use a point_clientcommand with the <span class="bbcode-b">input </span><span class="bbcode-b">Command play awesomemusic.ogg</span></p>
<p>Haven’t tested it tho.</p>
<p>This list shows the paths for Hl2:<br>

            <p>Goldsource did it back in the WON days when it was streaming from a CD. I don’t believe the current steam version of HL is capable of it anymore, despite using the same entity setup.<br>
I don’t recall Source ever doing that, mainly because the way music is played in Source isn’t via a command to start streaming audio, but from an in-map entity that doesn’t exist anymore past the level transition.<br>
Really annoying when you’re say, getting into a track in HL2’s airboat chapters and you hit the changelevel.</p>

            <p>I think Source used to be capable of it, but they removed the feature at some point. Their MP3 code must be resetting itself during the loading screen.</p>
