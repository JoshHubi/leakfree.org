    <title>poor FPS, Swap_Buffers and mat_viewportscale</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/poor-fps-swap-buffers-and-mat-viewportscale/10943</link>
    <description>I&#39;m getting much lower FPS than I would expect at higher resolutions (1920x1200).

showbudget was showing that most of the time was spent in [b]Swap_Buffers[/b]:
![bm_c1a3b0001.jpg|690x500](upload://AeYUaWyhucm2ILAYzMR3BStPg9.jpeg)

however, i noticed that the [b]Swap_Buffers[/b] was significantly reduced, if i set [code]
mat_viewportscale 0.99999
[/code]:
![bm_c1a3b0000.jpg|690x500](upload://y6Mmgc3G67c2r8JJxnoZ4WMokG.jpeg)

obviously the number of pixels being drawn isn&#39;t significantly different. can anyone explain what&#39;s going on here?

it would seem to indicate something weird in the fragment shaders. is there something in there that&#39;s disabled by having a non-1 viewport scale?

here&#39;s my sysinfo:

</aside>
<p>Hmm, differences look like there’s a some kind of an ambient occlusion kicking in (you could easily see that the lighting differs at the places that are expected to be affected by radiosity simulation done in the AO simulating pixel shader).</p>
<p>This theory is pretty much in line with the FPS drop you’re facing as it is a known fact that driver-forced AO for nVIDIA cards only works in case you have offscreen backbuffer the same size as your screen resolution is (check investigations done by DSfix author on this topic if you’re interested in the gory details from the programmers PoV).</p>
<p>Check your nVIDIA driver setting. Make sure you have AO disabled. You could also try installing nVIDIA Inspector and using it to force AO disabled for hl2.exe profile.</p>

<p>Yes, linear FPS scale with the vieportscale changes is something that is expected to get in as long as FPS is fillrate-capped. Having sudden drop when it is set to 1 is a really strange thing.

<p>a) Driver-related problem. There are a lot of things nVIDIA drivers do “behind the scenes” and some execution paths could only kick in if the size of the offscreen render buffer matches the resolution of current d3d swapchain. I’ve seen some signs of similar behavior with OpenGL when been implementing a small app to test Adaptive/Standard vsync behavior in the dual display environment for nVIDIA cards. It might be that driver does something strange/wrong and causes FPS drop you observe. There are no obvious ways to check it except for trying downgrading or upgrading driver version in hopes that the problem would disappear. Also it’s worth checking if you get the same drop in windowed mode.</p>

<p>You had restarted the game after changing the resolution and gfx settings, hadn’t you? I’ve seen similar problems on my rig while been messing with different resolutions, switching fullscreen/windowed, e.t.c. After changing two or three different settings pressing “Apply” after each I end up with messed up rendering that been looking similar to what could be seen on your screenshot. Quiting the game and starting it up again fixed the problem.</p>

            <p>Pretty strange bug really. You’re right that you most likely hitting fillrate shortage due to some pixel shader eating up all of it. It might be a problem with of the fullscreen post-processing shaders. What could you do is to turn off HUD and chromatic postprocessing in the game settings menu and try using one of the methods to disable noise postprocessing shader described here:</p>
<p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=502093#post502093" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=502093#post502093</a></p>
<p>What else would be interesting is try changing dxlevel used from what you use to other among 90, 95 and 98. Then, checking what’s displayed with mat_fillrate 1 might give and insight on what is wrong here.</p>
<p>What else? Hmm, maybe check for overdraw-related problems, there was a cvar for that. Use “find overdraw” in console, it’d be easy to determine which one is correct to use.</p>

            <p>I’m getting much lower FPS than I would expect at higher resolutions (1920x1200).</p>
<p>showbudget was showing that most of the time was spent in <span class="bbcode-b">Swap_Buffers</span>:<br>

<p>however, i noticed that the <span class="bbcode-b">Swap_Buffers</span> was significantly reduced, if i set <code>
mat_viewportscale 0.99999
</code>:<br>

<p>obviously the number of pixels being drawn isn’t significantly different. can anyone explain what’s going on here?</p>
<p>it would seem to indicate something weird in the fragment shaders. is there something in there that’s disabled by having a non-1 viewport scale?</p>
<p>here’s my sysinfo:</p>
