    <title>Half-Life Expansions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-expansions/13408</link>
    <description>Has anyone heard anything concerning if they are going to do the same thing to the expansions Blue Shift and Opposing Forces as they did with the original Half-Life game? I am currently playing Opposing Forces and finished Blue Shift a few days ago and thought they both would look good and benefit if they were modded too.</description>

            <p>There is actually a team of fine people doing their own rendition of both the expansions from scratch the way the BM team did HL, and you can find them <a href="https://tripminestudios.com/forum/portal.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br>
There is also a small talented team working on remaking Blue Shift using Black Mesa as a base - official thread <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14680" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
