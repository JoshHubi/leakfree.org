            <p>I think Opposing Force is almost as good as Half Life, the story isn’t as good but the new weapons balance it out. Decay is under rated, it’s certainly better than Blue Shift which is just a HD pack with a campaign to test it in. The only thing that annoys me is how people consantly insist that they aren’t canon.</p>

            <p>The best part about BS was the tram ride. It made the facility feel a lot more alive then it did in HL. Kinda reminds me of what Black Mesa will (hopefully) be more like (In regards to the tram ride feeling more alive, the rest of the game was just kinda meh).</p>

            <p>I loved both the expansions (Even Decay, to an extent). I miss the days when their canonicity wasn’t constantly debated, and they were just part of the Half-Life story. In retrospect, I do think Race X was unnecessary (at the time I thought they were Xenians), but the enemies were cool, and offered some pretty fun (and scary) fight sequences.</p>

            <p>Op4 was fun the first time I played it.  The race x story started to suck after hl2 came out. I think shep has so many fans because literal minded teenage nerds had a tough time getting their brain around the idea that a 4 eyed M.I.T.  n3rd  kick so much inter-dimensional alien ass.<br>
Blue shift was cool because you got to know barney. the search for rosenberg was tedious and the end was anti-climactic, but it was only an expansion pack after all.</p>

<p>I rule that there shall be an expansion where you play as a baby Garg on Xen and beat your way up to the top until you evolve into a full Garg. THEN! you get teleported to Earth via the ResCasade. Beat your way up to the top where you evolve into the one and only purple Garg!</p>
<p>Teleport back to Xen, kill and destroy everything, rule the borderworld.</p>

            <p>I liked Blue Shift, it was nothing spectacular but I thought it was nice to see Black Mesa from a new perspective.</p>
<p>Opposing Force was also all right, but I disliked how the black ops were transformed into a new independent faction, the Race X, that fancy vest thing that the soldiers wear, and the Displacer weapon (which was fun but retarded plot-wise).</p>

            <p>I liked opposing force, it felt like an actual half life game,But how is it that the new race X is in the same black mesa and yet Gordon never fought them.</p>
<p>blue shift was just incredibly meh, it was so unmemorable and it was short and had to many fucking headcrabs! that and playing as barney could have been a lot better if you had interacted with freeman instead of one cameo.  Xen was arguably the worst section of the game,Atleast with op4 gearbox made an effort to please fans</p>
<p>This just shows that nobody makes half life better than valve</p>

            <p>Thank you. About time this thread was made.</p>
<p>Opposing Force is okay as a game, though Race-X was retarded. Regardless, they added new weapons, new environments, the story was familiar yet somehow felt different <span class="bbcode-i">(in a good way)</span>, and it had a few moments of nostalgia from Half-Life.<br>
The biggest problem, however, isn’t really about the game itself but rather the rabid fanbase of the most overrated character in the history of video games <span class="bbcode-i">(yes, that includes Master Chief)</span>… <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">Adrian Shephard.</span></span></span><br>
How this generic, uninteresting, unoriginal, and boring character got so popular is beyond me, but it has to stop. Some people came up with insane theories that he was in Portal. And now they want him back in Episode 3. I swear I will uninstall it as soon as I see him if he’s really in the game! Thankfully, I know Valve isn’t that retarded.<br>
Oh, and there’s that one bug in <span class="bbcode-i">“We Are Not Alone”</span> that makes the game crash after you open the door. It still isn’t fixed as far as I know. You have to no clip and gently move around to make sure you don’t look at the glowing ball that Gordon jumps into.</p>
<p>But the biggest piece of shit is a blue one, ie Blue Shit, also known as Blue Shift by a few unfun people. The game is basically Half-Life, but shorter and shity-er.<br>
There are no new weapons <span class="bbcode-i">(hell, a few of them were removed)</span>, the environments sucked, the puzzles weren’t as clever or fun, and the ending was a joke!</p>
<p>So, yeah. Fuck you Gearbox. Randy Pitchford has no right to talk shit about Valve.</p>
