    <description>Hi, extremely happy that black mesa has come out on steam. I had an idea of a possible co-op gamemode. Where the host is freeman and a friend could drop in as a Security guard, just an idea. What do you think?</description>

            <p>Oh don’t worry I’m sure modders will attempt something similar at some point thanks to the workshop, but it might be a while, since I guess some people will wait for the game to exit early access.</p>

            <p>This has been suggested so many times and the devs stated that it won’t be in Black Mesa. But I guess that doesn’t mean that you can’t build custom maps for coop.</p>

            <p>I know, not too sure how Zen would work, plus they would have to render player models. But it would still be awesome.</p>
