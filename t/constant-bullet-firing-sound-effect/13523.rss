    <title>Constant Bullet Firing Sound Effect?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/constant-bullet-firing-sound-effect/13523</link>
    <description>I played Black Mesa about a year ago and never finished it.

Now I booted it up, loaded up my latest save game, and it appears some ambient sound is mixed with some kind of gun fire constantly shooting.

Is there any way to fix this?</description>
