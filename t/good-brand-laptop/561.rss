<p>It’s probably an issue on your part, because I’ve seen lots of Lenovos in my life and none of them ever broke. Hell, I still have a 12 years old Thinkpad at home and it works like a charm.</p>

            <p>Apologies if I repeat anything, I don’t have time to read the whole thread at the moment…</p>
<p>I use an Acer, bought it 2 years ago for £400 and it still works as well now as it did then. Its:</p>
<p>Pentium Dual-Core 1.46GHz<br>
358MB X3100 Mobile Intel Graphics Accelerator :fffuuu:<br>
2GB RAM<br>
120GB HDD<br>
15.4" screen</p>
<p>Its not gonna win any prizes for performance, but if it did it would be too damn heavy and well out of my price range</p>
<p>For gaming, I stick to older games (Simcity 4, Civilization 4, System shock 2 oddly enough), but it runs half-life 2 comfortably, and can just about manage episode 2</p>
<p>Its also where black mesa’s gonna end up, being the only PC I own, which may not end well  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I’m using an HP laptop ATM, and it can play SOME games.  It can’t play TF2 or HL2 without lagging, but it can play a few chambers of Portal alright. So, no.  No gaming.  Everything else is exceptional, and I love it!  The only games it can really play though are flash, and emulators.</p>
<p>EDIT: My little brother can play the Sims 2 just fine and the game Sid Meier’s Pirates runs perfectly.</p>

            <p>i would stay away from dell personally, everyone i know who has had one has had it literally fall apart, my friends had no sound due to the port falling out, the batt went out 2 times in the 2 years he had it, and the power cord had to be taped into.</p>

            <p>er, who said HP laptops are shit? I have an HP (refurbished) DV6 thats comparable to my old PC hardware. Battery life on it is an issue and it runs very hot (Athlon core) but it is a best of a thing AND at £360 bloody good value</p>

            <p>Compaq isn’t horrible.  Paid $600 CDN for mine last year.  Vista, 2GB, X2.  Ran HL2:EP2 at 60fps (settings rock bottom).  Absolutely fine if your only goal is to play the game, not really experience it.  As for bloatware, you’re getting a cheap laptop.  Takes 30 mins at most to uninstall that crap.</p>

<p>No, as I mentioned earlier, if you’re going to buy a netbook, your best choice is ASUS, they pretty much invented the netbook, and you can get one with a bigger hard drive, better design and better hardware for a smaller price.</p>
<p>If you want a netbook with a 10" screen, any asus EEE PC 1000 series will do, if you want a smaller one that almost fits in your pocket, go for the 900HA like me, you can get a sweet deal on it at some places, I know I did.</p>
<p>specs:</p>
<p>same as the dell you chose, except the chassis size is only 9" and the resolution is 1024x600 with a 160GB seagate SATA hard drive and of course the built-in webcam.</p>

</aside>
<p>Downloading will be fine, internet is good, but it has a small hard drive, and you won’t be able to store much on that. Video games aren’t going to happen on that thing, it’s too weak.</p>
<p>You’ll need at least $600 for a system that can play a few games. If you want to play games, go get a job, earn some money, and then buy a computer, because this thing isn’t worth it if you want to play games.</p>

            <p>Nettops are completely useless for gaming. The system you posted would struggle to run Peggle (no, really. It doesn’t have a high enough screen resolution).</p>
<p>It would just about manage downloading movies, but you won’t be watching anything in HD, and you won’t be able to store all that much on a hard drive.</p>

<p>That’s a very weak spec (to be expected, since it’s a netbook). The only possible reason you could have for buying that is if you need the portability of a netbook.</p>

</aside>
<p>It is? Well can it at least handle me downloading and removing loads of movies and videogames? Or will it die on me?</p>
<p>Dam… gonna need more help with this.</p>

            <p>If you’re going with Dell, go for the extended warranty, I hear they usually die just as the basic warranty expires.</p>

            <p>In my experience:</p>
<p>Asus, Sony, Toshiba = Good</p>
<p>HP, Acer = sux0rz</p>
<p>Dell, Gateway = No experience</p>
<p>Edit: Agreed with everyone.  You’re not going to be gaming on a 400 laptop.</p>
