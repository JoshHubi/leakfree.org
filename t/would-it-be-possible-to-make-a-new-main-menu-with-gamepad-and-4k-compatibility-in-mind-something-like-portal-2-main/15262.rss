    <description>So, I&#39;ve played black mesa quite often and I&#39;ve always wanted to just play on my TV from my bed. However there&#39;s one thing that kind of stops that and that&#39;s the main menu system.
There&#39;s some issues like unable to use the gamepad to navigate the load/save menu to save and the new game menu is annoying to use too.
The buttons are also REALLY small when on anything higher than 1080p as they don&#39;t scale with resolution.
If it could be anything like the Portal 2 main menu in functionality that would be great, it could also be a chance to allow another additional menu  selection for custom maps! (This means no more using console to play custom sp maps)
Compare Black Mesa to Portal 2 and notice just how easier it is to navigate on any higher resolution or with a gamepad compared to Black Mesa

Black Mesa

<p>It’s fantastic news to hear that controller support is being improved! Most developers, especially smaller developers, completely overlook controller support so it’s good to see it being thought about and worked on.</p>
<p>I don’t suppose a weapon wheel would be too much to ask for? You can already simulate one using the Steam controller configurator’s on-screen menus, but that requires manually binding all the weapon keys. Having a proper, built-in weapon wheel would be fantastic.</p>
<p>Any chance you guys could implement the <a href="https://boilingsteam.com/steam-dev-days-2016-the-steam-controller-api/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Steam Controller API</a> so that no matter what controller or configuration we use, we will get proper glyphs and on-screen prompts, as well as properly working action sets? I would sell my firstborn child for that (joke’s on you, I have no firstborn child)</p>

<p>Since textfam mentioned an extensive UI overhaul with controllers in mind a weapon wheel might be on the table or something just as good</p>

            <p>I actually preferred the Xbox 1 HL2’s weapon switch over weapon wheels. Much faster- just a couple of taps while you’re moving around and dodging gunfire instead of having to obscure the whole screen with a radial.</p>

</aside>
<p>I was thinking more along the lines of press Y to switch to your last weapon, and hold Y to bring up the weapon wheel, which seems to be the modern game trope.</p>
<p>That said, if they implement the Steam Controller API then we would just have “last weapon” and “weapon wheel” actions and we can bind them however we want  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
