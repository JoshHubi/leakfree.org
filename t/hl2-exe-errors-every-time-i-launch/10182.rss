    <title>hl2.exe errors every time I launch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-exe-errors-every-time-i-launch/10182</link>
    <description>Sorry if this has been covered, but I cannot find another thread that deals with the problem I am having. Every time I try to run Black Mesa it goes to a black screen with a loading icon before windows informs me that hl2.exe has stopped working. I have vista, I have the SDK, and I have tried downloading DX 9.0c to only get a message that I have a newer version so no install is necessary. The Black Mesa game does appear on steam, which is how I am trying to launch it. Thanks for any help, I really want to play this game.</description>

<p>Thanks for the reply. I got it to work by reinstalling DX. I am playing it now, and enjoying it immensely.</p>
