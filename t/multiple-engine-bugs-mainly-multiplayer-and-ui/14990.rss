    <description>* multiplayer bugs/glitches that also happen on valve games such as half-life 2 deathmatch and half-life source deathmatch
1. [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/29235-A-few-multiplayer-bugs-some-after-recent-update-Oct-28-2016/?postID=624739#post624739&#39;]swimming animation sticking to players (click me for more info)[/url]
1. spectator ui is broken, unable to close the menu because the option is unreachable (workaround: [tt]retry[/tt])
1. scoreboard with added avatars and a lot of players easily can go off-screen

* In multiplayer [tt]+speed[/tt] turns into [tt]+walk[/tt] resulting in sprint unavailable and alt key &quot;stops working&quot; (is this the expected behavior?)

* GUI/HUD glitches/bugs
1. &quot;returning grenade&quot; loadscreen hint has a missing bind: it abruptly ends in &quot;press&quot; (who knows if there more wrong hints)
1. Mouse settings have additional boxes which is why the options dialog is wider
1. player name in spectator is rarely visible without the bugged menu as noted above

* [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/groups/BlackMesa/discussions/0/305509857567155255/&#39;]engine tools commandline [tt]-tools[/tt] does not work at all[/url]</description>
