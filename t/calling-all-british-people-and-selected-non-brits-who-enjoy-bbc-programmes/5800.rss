    <title>Calling all British people (and selected non-Brits who enjoy BBC programmes)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/calling-all-british-people-and-selected-non-brits-who-enjoy-bbc-programmes/5800</link>
    <description>So I saw [url=&#39;https://www.mitchbenn.com&#39;]Mitch Benn[/url] live recently (awesome show, highly recommended), and I&#39;ve seen that he has just released his new single in support of the BBC, seeing as the knives are coming out again over the TV licence. His [url=&#39;https://www.mitchbenn.com/blog/1084/proud_of_the_bbc_video_shoot_directions_etc.html&#39;]blog[/url] explains his own take on why he&#39;s doing it.

Help support a great British comedian and a great British institution - watch the video and grab a copy off Amazon. I challenge any British person to say there&#39;s not one thing mentioned in the song which they don&#39;t think is/was awesome.

Here&#39;s the song: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q2iZuU5WM[/url]

And here&#39;s the Amazon link (come on, it&#39;s 79p): [url]https://www.amazon.co.uk/Im-Proud-BBC-Single/dp/B0049090F8[/url]

Spread the word!</description>

            <p>BBC = WIN</p>
<p>No adverts. The News dosn’t report on the likes on peter fucking andre, and Horizon, its the best program on the BBC. I love pretty much nearly every topic covered, its also done with impartiality.</p>

            <p>It’s a shitload cheaper than Sky, you don’t have to pay for extra hardware, they do radio and online, they don’t ply you with adverts every five minutes, and they’ll never try to get you to pay extra to watch something. Sounds like a good deal to me.</p>
