    <title>Old School RPG&#39;s?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/old-school-rpgs/9113</link>
    <description>So, pretty much this summer I&#39;ve been playing through all the old school RPG&#39;s that I missed when I was a kid. So far, I&#39;ve completed Mother, Earthbound (Loved it), FF3, FFVII, and I&#39;m mid-way through Chrono cross.

I was just wondering If there are any really outstanding Rpg&#39;s that I may have missed. I&#39;ll most likely start mother 3 as soon as I&#39;m done with chrono cross. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!  :smiley:</description>

            <p>I would recommend Heroes of Might and Magic 2. It’s not quite an RPG, but you can level up your heroes, and it’s pretty damn fun and has nice aesthetics. Most people recommend 3, but there’s something about 2 that has much more “charm” than the 3rd.</p>

<p>I actually played those when they first came out. However you wouldn’t be able to play M&amp;M 1 to 5 today without an emulator. Even Might and Magic 6 to 8 needs adjustment made to make them playable (unless you are still running an XP machine). Might and Magic 9 had bugs even in XP and is just about unplayable in Vista or 7. I don’t really count Dark Messiah as part of the Might and Magic series.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>mmm yes, and they are pretty hard to start playing but they are masterpieces, through I didn’t like the 9th a lot. and what about UBIsoft ones I don’t consider them as part of Might and Magic universe.</p>

<p>Yeah, Arx is a really good game if you’re into immersive sims. Not a super in-depth RPG, but definitely a blast.</p>

<p>there was a content pack that was released recently for kotor 2 that makes the game…worth playing: <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm/news/tslrcm-18-released" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-sith-lords-restored-content-mod-tslrcm/news/tslrcm-18-released</a></p>
<p>it is pretty much mass effect before ea destroyed bioware.</p>
<p>xcom ufo defense is also as old school of an rpg/rts as you can get. ive been dying for someone to make an xcom ufo defense revamp so i dont have to run it in dosbox anymore.</p>
<p>dungeon siege 2 is a good dungeon crawler as well. always felt like diablo 2.5 to me.</p>

            <p>Considering you’ve already got all the Mother games on that list I put forward the suggestion of Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past</p>
<p>I’d say this was the Zelda games at the peak of their 2D games. I played many an hour on it and enjoyed about every second of it.</p>
<p>on a side note, I’m really excited I just got a copy of Earthbound the other day  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
