    <title>What is this movie?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-this-movie/12355</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t remember the name of a movie. It was about a man that was very quiet(probably autistic) and shy, and lived in the suburbs. He begins to work for a mobster as a hitman, because he is very good at shooting and doesn&#39;t feel remorse(as he is autistic). Finally he kills his boss and leaves the business, and gets a girlfriend who he tells that he was a killer, but she doesn&#39;t care and then the movie ends with both being together in the bed or something like that.

 I think in spanish it was called &quot;A sangre fria&quot;(that translates &quot;In cold blood&quot;). However I searched for that name and found another movie that is much older(from 1967, when the movie I&#39;m looking for is from the 90s or early 2000s). I don&#39;t know why, but I think Dustin Hoffmann was in it(not sure anyways). So, can you help me?</description>

            <p>None of those… Shit, I wouldn’t imagine it would be so hard to find it.</p>
<p>Okay, here is more info: When the main character is going to kill his boss, just before he shoots the boss says “You’re too close, step back”, but the main character doesn’t step back, and because of that he gets his clothes stained with blood.</p>

            <p>No… It’s older, I watched it at least 5 years ago. So it can’t be.</p>
