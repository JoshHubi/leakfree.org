    <title>BM and HL2 mods compatibility</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bm-and-hl2-mods-compatibility/11962</link>
    <description>There are lots of HL2 mods, or games that are built on top of HL2. E.g. Dear Esther, Nightmare Night 2 etc. These games require HL2 to be installed.

I don&#39;t have HL2. Can these mods be played in BM instead? If yes, how to do it?

Thanks,
         Martin.</description>

<p>Far from it. You need to decompile the maps (.bsps) then you need to correct all the area portals, I/O setups, and everything else in between. It’s not a quick operation. As I said, if you don’t have the knowledge, it’s not worth it.</p>

<p>Blue Shift is an expansion, no you can’t use it to run mods. You <span class="bbcode-i">require Half-Life 1, not the source version</span> to run Half-Life 1 mods like Paranoia, Sven Co-op, etc. You also need to run Half-Life 1 at least once (connecting to a game, be it single player or otherwise) for it to create a directory.</p>

<p>I believe that the GoldSource is way too different from Source 2007 (to which all the Orange Box games have been updated as far as I know) anyway for anything to work <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Not to mention the later versions of Source (Is 2011 still the latest?)</p>

            <p>The current version of Source is probably even more different than the HL2 launch build, so I guess it has even less legacy code these days.</p>

<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Source distantly originates from the GoldSrc engine, itself a heavily modified version of John D. Carmack’s Quake engine, as is explained by Valve employee Erik Johnson on the Valve Developer Community:[45]<br>
“ 	When we were getting very close to releasing Half-Life (less than a week or so), we found there were already some projects that we needed to start working on, but we couldn’t risk checking in code to the shipping version of the game. At that point we forked off the code in VSS to be both /$Goldsrc and /$Src. Over the next few years, we used these terms internally as “Goldsource” and “Source”. At least initially, the Goldsrc branch of code referred to the codebase that was currently released, and Src referred to the next set of more risky technology that we were working on. When it came down to show Half-Life 2 for the first time at E3, it was part of our internal communication to refer to the “Source” engine vs. the “Goldsource” engine, and the name stuck. 	”</p>
<p>Source was developed part-by-part from this fork onwards, slowly replacing GoldSrc in Valve’s internal projects[46] and explaining in part the reasons behind its unusually modular nature. Valve’s development of Source since has been a mixture of licensed middleware (Havok Physics, albeit heavily modified, and MP3 playback) and in-house-developed code.</p>
<p>John Carmack commented on his blog in 2004 that “there are still bits of early Quake code in Half-Life 2”.[47]</p>

            <p>HL1 is a completely different engine from HL2 (I’m assuming you’re not talking HL:S though), the GoldSrc, which essentially is a modified Quake. Valve later made their own engine (Yay, Source!) and remade HL1 for it (hence the name, Half-Life: Source).</p>

            <p>Some older mods may require HL2 itself installed but most recent or updated mods, only require the free Source SDK Base installed.</p>
<p>Besides, you could always buy Orange Box retail for cheap, if you can’t buy it online or something.</p>

            <p>Most of those mods do not require Half-Life 2 to be installed. You need the Source SDK(s) (located under tools in the games library) installed to play mods.</p>
<p>The only mod I know of that requires Half-Life 2, etc. installed is Half-Life 2: Wars.</p>

            <p>There are lots of HL2 mods, or games that are built on top of HL2. E.g. Dear Esther, Nightmare Night 2 etc. These games require HL2 to be installed.</p>
<p>I don’t have HL2. Can these mods be played in BM instead? If yes, how to do it?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Martin.</p>
