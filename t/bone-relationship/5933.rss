        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I, too, am a victim of bone garvest. It all happend one rainy evening. Everything was just going fine, until I accidently diarrhea’d in my bed. “Oh, SHIT!” I screamed at the top of my lungs. I ran to the bathroom, dropping poo all over the floor, and finally jump butt-first into the toilet, spewing wet feces all over the counter and shower curtains. “Phew!” I was very relieved at the nice save I just made. That was, until I realized that what I thought was the toilet, was actually my great grandmother. “Oh, uh- Hey, Grandy!” I pulled up my pants and sat up. “Didn’t think you were stopping by!” Grandy didn’t even respond. I thought she was having a total bitch reaction to something as little as having a bit of diarrhea. “Fuck you, Grandcunt!” I yelled, stomping out of the bathroom. Then I remembered. My great grandma was dead. “Ohhhh!” I had forgotten to flush her rotten corpse down the toilet. I then proceeded down stairs, to where I was expecting my breakfast. “Ma! I hope you didn’t make me ham and eggs! That stuff tastes awful, like really terr-” My breakfast wasn’t there, and neither was Ma. “What the FUCK!” I searched the entire house, and couldn’t find her any where. “Fine, I’ll make my own damn breakfast!” I opened up the fridge to look at the selection of food. “Waffles!” I pulled them out of the freezer, and they flew onto the counter. Literally. They fuckin’ flew. My waffles were actually a spaceship. “Holy SHIT!” They then broke the kitchin window, which they flew out of to get to their waffle mothership. “So beautiful…” I sniffed and wiped away a tear from my face. Or atleast I thought it was a tear. It wasn’t. It was actually my piss. “Wait, what…? OHH, SHIT!” I forgot I had surgically attached my dick to my head. Yes, Son. I was a unicorn. Suddenly, sounds came from the basement. Sounds of laughter, laughter that would be heard of an evil scientist. I carefully walked down the basement steps. Finally, I saw him. He wasn’t an evil scientist at all. He was actually an evil scientist. “DICKS!” I yelled, and tried to run up the stairs, but they broke on my way up. I fell to the concrete of the basement floor. I got up off the ground and walked over to greet myself to my new friend. “Hi.” I said. “Yes! I’ve <span class="bbcode-i">finally</span> found someone… someone I can use FOR MY BONE MORPHING MACHINE.” He chuckled. “But-” I began “NO, your bones will be morphed and harvested until the point of which you WON’T EVEN BE ABLE TO FEEL THEM!” I started to cry out of my dick again. “I dun’ wanna!” “DEAL WITH IT!” and he shoved me inside of the machine. The machine started shaking around and making loud noises. I could feel it. My bones were morphing. It was the most incredibly painful and bloody, bone-breaking, brutal, unpleasent thing that I had never even dreamed about thinking about having dreamed. After about one minute of being contained within the machine, I could feel it. But much stronger. My bones were warping into shapes which didn’t even exist. “FFFFFFFUCK MY FUCKING GODDAMN BOENS HOLYSFUCK OH PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF FUCKING CHRIST MY DEER DAMN FUCKING BONES!!!” My bones were being carnaged. my organs spewed everywhere, and then into my mouth, and I digested my organs. “NO!! I NEEDED THAT SHIT!” I was kind of hoping that swallowing my organs would solve the problem of them missing. Quite the opposite. My organs turned into bloody diarrhea.</p>
<p>To Be Continued.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Someone who actually knows something. And btw, it is related to black mesa, so I’m in the right forum section.</p>
<p>EDIT: Another term for it is called Rone Raghettios, if any of you have ever heard that before. Though it is rarely used.</p>
