            <p>I’m sure there are enough tolerant people out there who would like Half-Life as much as Black Mesa if they played it. Some people are tolerant to old games and they appreciate the graphics and gameplay etc.</p>
<p>But I think they will just like it, but not love it the way most of us do, because they played Black Mesa first. I, for my part, have deep feelings for Half-Life because it was my first real shooter, and it started my gaming career. I always knew there were games with better graphics (it was 2007 I guess), but I played it and fell in love with it. I love Black Mesa, too, but not the way I love Half-Life. The atmosphere in that game is so unique, I doubt that anyone could recreate that with Source engine. Sometimes less is more. And that’s what I love about Half-Life. You can make it look even more awesome as it looked in 1998, but you can’t recreate that kind of atmosphere. Half-Life was about rough blocky level design (comparing to Source), Scientists with stiff walking animations, security guards that all share the same look, diffuse textures, cheap graphical effects. That’s what makes Half-Life so appealing for me.</p>

            <p>Today’s ADD generation would most likely be turned off by even the original Inbound.</p>
<p>In Black Mesa it’s pretty cool and there’s a ton of eye candy. That’s how it was with Half Life at the time it was released. But these days the original HL Inbound would be unbearably boring to many.</p>

            <p>probably not good. i could imagine them not seeing the need to go back and play HL, the gameplay is almost identical (besides the missing ending) and all they would really experience is the same game but with shit graphics.</p>

            <p>“OH MY GOD I CAN MOVE!”<br>
“IT’S SO UNCLUTTERED”<br>
“I CAN JUMP!”<br>
“I CAN GET AROUND EASIER AND PROGRESS FASTER!”</p>
<p>no offense, BM, but some puzzles confused the heck out of me, like having to turn those two valves in Unforseen Consequences (when you first meet the Houndeyes) to open a door…and Power Up stumped me, then I finally saw those two plugs in the Generator Room</p>
<p>also, On a Rail, when you had to turn off the power, plug in the plug, turn the power back on…</p>
<p>good concepts, I love them now, but still…</p>

            <p>Todays kids would probably just turn it off before they got to office complex.<br>
But if someone older who played games back then, quake and such, played it. They would probably play it through and like it. Possibly more than Black Mesa.</p>

            <p>they would even take a 5 second repeated glance at it because A “The graffix sux, the gameplay sux, omg this system is horrible!” ect. they’ll find ways to complain about how much half life sucks by today standards despite being a what…14 year old game at this point? I mean half the people can’t even understand a duck jump in black mesa despite there being a prompt for it. Think they’re going to go back and play the original thinking good things about it? highly doubtful. They’ll do anything and everything they can to smear the game into the ground and blow it up with a nuke.</p>
