    <description>Would you shrug it off?  Would you feel seriously let down?

The levels of hope and trust some of you have for this mod makes me wonder how devastating it would be if this was indeed a hoax.</description>

            <p>I would not be surprised. Most people think it’s a hoax already. Unless they get a demo or beta they will always think it is a hoax and will ignore it after it is released because of what happened to DN:F.</p>
<p>The public has learned the hard way that vaporware after 7+ years = shitty result, no exceptions</p>

            <p>Yeah, seems like they’re scrapping episode 3 in favour of a full game.  At least that’s what I’ve heard.  But the idea of the entire new game taking place in some Arctic research base doesn’t seem great to me, especially after what’s come before.</p>

<p>At this juncture, with so much information and evidence that the mod actually does exist, what I’d need now to show that it is a hoax is some pretty solid evidence from those saying it’s a hoax.</p>
<p>I am so eager to play Black Mesa, it’s not even funny, but it’s a free mod so I can wait for it to be finished.  If it never comes out and it is, indeed, a hoax, well, I wasn’t centering my life around waiting for BM anyway, so I’ll just move on.</p>
