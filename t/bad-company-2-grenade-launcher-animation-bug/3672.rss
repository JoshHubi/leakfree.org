    <title>Bad Company 2 Grenade Launcher Animation Bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bad-company-2-grenade-launcher-animation-bug/3672</link>
    <description>Okay so today I noticed a little annoying bug, its noting game breaking but its annoying. When I play as assault class and switch to my grenade launcher instead of flipping up the sights like it normally does, my guy puts away the gun completely and pulls it out again with the sights already flipped up. If anyone here is havin the problem and knows a fix any help would be greatly appreciated. I play the game max&#39;d out @ 1680x1050 in DX10 with 4x AA and 16x AF.

            <p>This happened in the beta too, but they patched it and the animation worked again so its strange that the problem is back in full release. Also the animation works fine for me in singleplayer.</p>
