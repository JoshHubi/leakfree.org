            <p>All I’m saying is that we have no actual evidence of these things working because of the speaker. Lincoln never had a chance to use the tactics, meaning he a quote by him means nothing. Quote someone who actually used that tactic successfully.</p>

            <p>The attack on Fort Sumter began as a result of President Buchanan (not Lincoln) attempting to resupply the fort.  The Civil War was already well getting ready to begin before Lincoln even stepped foot in the White House.</p>
<p>Lincoln becomes president: March 4, 1861<br>
Attack on Fort Sumter: April 12-13, 1861</p>
<p>39 days.</p>

            <p>Yeah you are right Nietzsche all quotes are random. I was hoping to show there is something like respect of the enemy among great leaders.</p>
<p>Something else: The senatoress was in favour of publicly available weapons, and got shot in the head by a commoner’s handgun. AM I wrong or is that ironic?</p>

<p>Danielsangeo: yeah, i hate it too, but I’m just as guilty of it as everyone else. It’s a habit, to simply lump everybody you disagree with into a category you hate. It’s really an ignorant way to do business and I try to limit it as much as I can.</p>

            <p>People in politics and basically everywhere else have no more respect and appreciation for enemies and dissidents. In a dictatorship that is the status quo. In “Democracies” that is a dooming sign, for this respect is an underlying principle of democracy. For when you have no respect for the other side, you can not maintain a moral basis or legitimiation for the existence of for your own action, for all you want is unabridged power. History teaches us that such societies end badly.</p>
<p>Palin’s worldview and the treatment of her enemies is what makes her the archetype of a very very bad politician. If she ever gets elected into the Oval Office I will start building a bomb shelter.</p>
<p>“Do good to your friends to keep them, to your enemies to win them.”</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>“The best way to destroy an enemy is to make him a friend.”</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>“Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names”</p>
<p>John Fitzgerald Kennedy</p>

            <p>Let’s just cut to the point here. Niggers shouldn’t be presidents, only bad stuff happens to the country. Look at every country in Africa!</p>
<p>I’m absolutely disgusted that the country I love is being run by a cotton-hoarding slave. I can’t believe white folks stick up for him. I want all of his supporters dead. I’m seriously considering leaving the States and move to a country with a proper government and isn’t run by a foreign fool. I heard Belgium’s pretty cool.</p>

            <p>Garth: no, my point that you are using a logical fallacy still stands. Go google it if you don’t understand. You’re trying to deny a group of people the right to protect themselves because a minuscule fraction of them can have violent tendencies. Wiki has a wonderful example about security cameras and what not.</p>
<p>Also, I can tell you know absolutely nothing of the disorder or you wouldn’t be making such sweeping generalizations. When I have episodes they usually involve me by myself, flipping shit, away from everyone else. The very last thing I want is to see another human being. If someone approaches me and tries to touch or talk to me I go comatose and stop responding. Schizophrenia and the related disorders are extremely <span class="bbcode-i">inwardly</span> focused. When you’re terrified that some immaterial, non-existent force is going to lock you up the last thing on your mind is giving them reasons to. It’s such an over-whelming, crushing feeling that the only thing you can do is close your eyes and wait for it to pass.</p>
<p>Violent felons cannot own guns (I’m not sure if this is a federal or state law, but I know it’s an extremely common practice). It makes more sense to deny someone the ability to own a gun AFTER they’ve proven themselves to be violent.</p>
<p>Anybody can have violent tendencies. Why just ban schizophrenics from having guns? If you’re so worried about it, why not ban everybody from having guns, if you think that’s going to fix the problem. (which it won’t).</p>
<p>If someone really wants to hurt or kill another human being, they’re going to find a way.</p>
<p>Your argument is bad and you should feel bad.</p>
