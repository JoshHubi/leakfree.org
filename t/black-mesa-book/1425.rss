<p>Hey man, its just good to see that other people know about it.  I thoroughly enjoyed every word of every sentence of every chapter.  I thought the characterization of Freeman was SPOT ON, too.</p>

            <p>Your writing needs some improvement. Also, there is a literal novelization of Half Life and its expansion packs (Blue Shift and Opposing Force) on <a href="http://Fanfiction.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Fanfiction.net</a> which is worth a look, if not much. It gives Freeman a personality and takes place before, during, and after the incident. It does alter the story and map layout a bit, so technically it’s not a novelization. It’s more like a remake of the game in story format.</p>
<p>Here’s the link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3147068/1/The_Black_Mesa_Incident" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3147068/1/The_Black_Mesa_Incident</a></p>
<p>So, in essence, you should be better off doing a Half Life spin-off. Not to insult your writing, but the novelization’s already been done, and your writing isn’t much better.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you’re going to give up that easily you can forget being a writer on whatever level. It’s true, and I’ll be blunt here, your first draft isn’t good, but then what other purpose does the act of refinement provide? Read it again, alter it, and repeat until it starts to look good. If you’re fresh out of high school and you think that your current draft is acceptable, I would honestly say that coming back to the story, once you’ve gained some experience and read other novels, would be invaluable. And if you <span class="bbcode-i">don’t</span> think it’s acceptable, then I hasten to enquire why you thought it was a good idea to post it on a forum. If it’s not up to an acceptable level in your opinion, then all you’ll get are criticisms which will destroy your morale. I’m being brutal here, but you need that. Here are some tips in the meantime. You can take them as you wish.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Severely alter the narrative. At the moment it’s just a third-person narrative of the worst kind, simply saying what’s happening without any detail or exposition. Gordon did this, then he did that, then this person said that… it grates. It’s like someone watching someone else play the game with the sound off. Have you considered a first-person narrative for example? Where’s the detail? For someone who hasn’t played the game, this sort of narrative will provide <span class="bbcode-i">nothing</span> towards giving a description of the events or the location, and for those who <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> played the game, you’re just repeating what’s happened without adding anything. In fact, the details are so lifeless that you seem to be taking away from the experience of playing the game. Have you considered the narrative from another person’s perspective, or splitting the narrative between two or more people?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the story different from other stories. One of the most important things I’ve learned about writing is to develop your own style above everything else. It doesn’t even need to make strict grammatical sense (although clearly you’ll need to know the very basics of grammar), just as long as it reads well. For example, James Ellroy, the crime novelist, writes in a very awkward staccato style, where sentences are only a few words long. Many of his sentences don’t make grammatical sense but they work because they make rhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep working on it. You can always come back to it. You can come back to it in several years time even, and remember it and realise how dramatically your style has changed. You can think that an essay or coursework that you did when you were 16 was brilliant, and for that age group you may well be right, but come back to it a few years later and you’ll realise how wrong you were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t focus so much on the story. Focus on narrative, plot structure and description. The story, as nonsensical as this may sound, is peripheral. I think it was Raymond Chandler who wrote that people don’t care about the story, they just <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> that do. Found it - not quite what I thought it was, but it serves the same purpose: <span class="bbcode-i">“My theory was that readers just thought that they cared about nothing but the action; that really although they didn’t know it, they cared very little about the action. The thing they really cared about, and that I cared about, was the creation of emotion through dialogue and description.”</span><br>
What I mean by story is the action and excitement that comes with an exhilirating tale. You think that you care about that, much like with a magician, you think you want to know the explanation, but in actuality the most permanent aspect of the story and what will remain with you the longest is the human aspect - the emotion, the sadness, the humour - the characters’ humanity. In this respect, you can take the worst sort of story, and Half-Life has plenty of that, and still make it work, but you <span class="bbcode-i">need</span> other characters in there, and dialogue too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read. It doesn’t matter what you read, whether its fiction, crime, fantasy or historical novels, just as long as you analyse what you’ve read and say why you liked it or why you didn’t. Not only will this expand your knowledge and experience of reading, but it will also develop your own style of writing which, above all else, is necessary. And, with any luck, you’ll enjoy reading them too. God knows why you’d want to write if you didn’t.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>A loud buzzing exploded Gordon’s Freeman’s head.  Groaning, he turned over in bed and slapped the offending noise.  He opened his bleary eyes and saw the time: 8:14.  Shit, he thought, his eyes snapping open.  I’m late.  Peeling the covers off, he stumbled towards the bathroom.</p>
<p>The light in the bathroom caused pain to shoot into his brain.  Why had he let Barney talk him into that third round of drinks at the canteen?  He splashed water on his face to chase away the demons.</p>
<p>Later, he stepped onto tram.  Sitting on a seat Gordon thought back to the time he received a letter from the Black Mesa Research Facility.  The P.A. system coldly reminded him of how late he was.</p>
<p>It was the end of a semester at the University of Innsbruck.  He had been offered a job as a research associate in theoretical physics.  Not only would he be paid well, but the Facility also provided him with a dormitory.  Gordon watched as the Facility passed by below him.</p>
<p>The Facility seemed to be feeling what he was feeling.  There was a large crack in a containment tank that was spilling out glowing green liquid.  A robot had been dispatched to repair the damage.  Finally, at the end of the ride, a security guard also reminded him that he was late.</p>
<p>Inside the Facility, there were more problems…</p>
