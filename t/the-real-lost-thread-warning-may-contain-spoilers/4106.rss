            <p>Apparently the Lost complete collection is supposed to have 12 to 14 minutes of extra footage which focuses on Hurley and Bens time as protectors of the island.</p>

            <p>I mean, most of the actors on the show were top-notch.  Even Titus Welliver, who played the MiB’s original form, was epic.  Christian was played terrifically.  MOST characters was played by a respectable actor (Though Evangeline Lilly is iffy for me…).  But Michael Emerson and Terry o’Quinn knocked it out of the park in every scene they were in.</p>

 Burbinator:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are you making it so complex.</p>
<p>Dark (as you call him) <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> the monster, only without a body. This was caused by the light. Pretty simple.<br>
The monster (i.e. Dark) can appear as anyone whose dead body is on the island.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Complex? Nah, I’m aiming for the simplest explanation.<br>
Dark was killed… the first body the smoke monster encountered was his, so it makes sense it would have taken his image. I don’t see any reason the original man’s spirit would have transmogrified into the smoke. The smoke seemed to enjoy playing the role of Locke, and would logically have acted role of the murdered brother to mess with the mind of the light’s protector.</p>
<p>If theory 1 from my previous post holds, and Dark’s body awoke Smokey, then we could come up with a number of reasons why Smoke was once human. Of course, maybe Smokey lied about that, and wanted to seem human in order to better manipulate people… when we first found out new-Locke was actually Smokey, there was no doubt it stayed in human form to to better manipulate.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Burbinator">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Burbinator:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>As for Jack, the light was out when he was there. I assume he got kicked out before anything more could happen. The fact that he was still alive when he came out points to this direction, as it should have killed him.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think it’s pretty clear that Jack didn’t turn into a “monster” because he hadn’t died yet.<br>
Remember though, he was no longer the protector of the island when he went inside, so that didn’t protect him.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Of course we can start by ruling out he didn’t turn into a smoke monster. (That doesn’t conflict with my point above, that people don’t get turned into smoke, and they are separate characters.)<br>
When he came out… well <span class="bbcode-i">something</span> had to have brought him out. He wasn’t dead, but he did pass out in that EM field as it was fully recharging. I don’t remember anybody of any authority saying exposure to this well phenomenon would be instant death… all we learned is the ubercharged EM field used by Whitmore for testing EM subjectivity is lethal to most people.</p>
<p>Going in, being electromagnetically detected or disturbing the perfectly balanced EM field, could trigger or release Smokey.</p>
<p>If a sole smoke entity got released by Dark’s body, there’s no purpose in discussing the end of Jack. But with theory 2 from my previous post, if Jack triggered a <span class="bbcode-i">second</span> unique smoke (or if he re-released Smokey whose essence was somehow returned when Desmond flipped the gigantic switch (explaining why those non-mortality rules stopped applying)), well that would explain how he got out, and it would add a tragic twist in that nothing was accomplished (with another Smokey on the still-stable island), and that would not conflict any with Smokey’s first awakening.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: now that I think about it, the twins’ mother did say there was a little bit of the light in everyone. Maybe the light in the cave separated the light from the darkness in Dark, and absorbed the light, while letting the darkness go.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Interesting… that would thematically match the belief it was transformation. It doesn’t explain any of the rules, though, which is why I think Smokey pre-dated the arrival of Dark’s body. All that ancient mayan-looking stuff, for instance… so I settle on <span class="bbcode-i">ancient</span> smoke being released (as the body remained perfectly intact, and not split into such fantastic dualistic elements).</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that Jack wasn’t affected might be because the thing hadn’t powered up yet, as mentioned above, or maybe it was because he didn’t have any darkness in him? He kind of resolved his internal conflicts on the island, didn’t he.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He got moved… which kinda means he was most certainly affected. As any-nonDesmond-body would be.</p>
<p>Makes more sense than trying to equate internal dilemmas with smoke itself.</p>

            <p>you cant really predict whats gonna happen over 6 years tho so its not possible to fully plan a thing like this. for example they wanted mr eko to be really major but the actor wanted to leave. also ben was gonna be a pretty minor character but the actor turned out so great they kept him on and ben was the best.</p>

            <p>Personally i don’t watch it, but the hype and love gone into this show by the fans; there was NO way they could of ended it well unless it had all been pre-written from start to finish (which i doubt it was  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> .</p>

<p>Here’s just one example - So like, the atomic bomb supposedly created an alternate timeline where people were slightly different, so you think that they’re remembering things from their other lives, but no, they’re just dead. So the bomb didn’t work. So after they all died they went back in time and ended up on the plane that they were on that crashed in real life except it didn’t crash after they were dead and AAAHHHHH my braaaains!!!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The alternate timeline wasn’t an alternate timeline at all. It’s a borderworld between this world and the next, or something to that effect.<br>
The bomb did work. That’s what sent them from the 70s back to the present.<br>
They didn’t all die, only Juliet did. They didn’t go back in time either, they went <span class="bbcode-i">forward</span> in time (as mentioned above).<br>
The plane not crashing never happened. See above.</p>

<p>Then we still don’t understand why the man in black (whose name we don’t know for some reason) became a smoke monster (which we don’t even really know what it is) when he went into the light and Jack and Desmond didn’t. And what was the deal with Walt? And why couldn’t Jacob and the MIB hurt each other or the chosen people? etc., etc.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>All of this basically comes down to the power of the island. Along with healing faster, regaining feeling in the legs, and so on. The power of the light, as it were.</p>

<p>How come Desmond or Jack didn’t turn into Smoke Monsters when they went into the light?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Like Grum said, Desmond’s out of the picture.</p>
<p>There are two possible answers to your question in terms of Jack:1. There was 1 smoke monster, and it was only released when Dark’s body had first disturbed it</p>
<ol>
<li>Jack’s interference let out a 2nd smoke monster (or re-created the 1st one)</li>
</ol>
<p>There is some circumstantial evidence to follow theory number 2. Remember how Dark’s body was returned to some random place on the surface after the whole smoke-release thing, where Jacob found it again? Well, isn’t it fascinating that Jack showed up at some similar place before kicking it… he certainly didn’t <span class="bbcode-i">climb</span> out of there.</p>

            <p>I found it ironic an overly complex ripoff of Jacob’s Ladder actually enlisted a major character named Jacob who caused everything.</p>

<p>Then we still don’t understand why the man in black (whose name we don’t know for some reason) became a smoke monster (which we don’t even really know what it is)…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He was dead, and the smoke-monster just used his body image (like he did later with Locke) since it showed up for him to grab. He could do that swap as long as the protector lived. The dark man was actually pretty good, he only flipped out and took a small act of revenge when his entire community was massacred. And for that, Jacob killed him in a second moment of passion. Dark’s body’s violation into the light was apparently enough to trigger that entity’s release.</p>

            <p>I don’t see the point of six seasons for such an ending, you could easily tell the whole story in three (maybe four) seasons. Would have been much better.</p>

            <p>I’ve watched Lost since it first came out and now…I really don’t know what to think of it. It was fun to watch but thinking of it as a whole…it doesn’t really make all that much sense to me tbh. I think it tried too hard to be too many things, and in the end I can’t help feeling a big sense of “wat”.</p>
<p>Here’s just one example - So like, the atomic bomb supposedly created an alternate timeline where people were slightly different, so you think that they’re remembering things from their other lives, but no, they’re just dead. So the bomb didn’t work. So after they all died they went back in time and ended up on the plane that they were on that crashed in real life except it didn’t crash after they were dead and AAAHHHHH my braaaains!!!</p>
<p>Then we still don’t understand why the man in black (whose name we don’t know for some reason) became a smoke monster (which we don’t even really know what it is) when he went into the light and Jack and Desmond didn’t. And what was the deal with Walt? And why couldn’t Jacob and the MIB hurt each other or the chosen people? etc., etc.</p>

            <p>Farewell Lost! You’ll always be right up there with the original Star Wars trilogy for me. Best show i’ve ever seen to hit basic cable TV.</p>

            <p>My prediction for the finale is that Jack will inherit Jacob and fight Sawyer, and Desmond is actually Jesus since he manages to save everyone’s ass at the end of every season.</p>
