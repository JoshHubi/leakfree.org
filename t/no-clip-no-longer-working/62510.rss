    <title>No clip no longer working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-clip-no-longer-working/62510</link>
    <description>For whatever reason, with the beta installed, I&#39;m not able to no clip, I&#39;ve enabled sv_cheats 1, god mode works, impulse 101 works, but whenever I enable no clip, i&#39;m not able to move in any direction, however I can look around like normal, but just cant move.  Is there something I may have done that would cause this? I&#39;ve verified files as well and everything comes back good. Help?</description>
