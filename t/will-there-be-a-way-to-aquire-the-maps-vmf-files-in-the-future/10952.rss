    <title>Will there be a way to aquire the map&#39;s VMF files in the future?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/will-there-be-a-way-to-aquire-the-maps-vmf-files-in-the-future/10952</link>
    <description>I was just wondering if the VMF files of Black Mesa&#39;s maps will ever be posted for download? I was going to try to make some BM: Horde Mode maps out of existing locations, and I wanted to keep the looks as close to the original map as possible. It would be much easier with the VMFs.  :smiley:</description>

            <p>I’ve used BSPSource and VMEX on Black Mesa’s maps and the only problems I’ve had is with some optimization being broken and a few lost solids in Lambda Core.</p>

            <p>^Doenst that depends on what decompiler you use?I’ve decompiled and edited a lot of Black Mesa maps, and everything works fine.<br>

            <p>That doesn’t really help, because it would probably break the careful lighting and extreme amount of entities they have ingame. I would be interested in this too, because there are some tweaks I would like to make to the game to make it more realistic and add more platform elements to the game, as I felt the bm team made the game way too easy sometimes with the platforming because of people complaining about it, adding a whole bunch of wooden platforms everywhere that don’t make any sense at all.</p>
<p>Not to mention the work that is being done or has been done by other people putting in some of the cut portions of surface tension, on a rail and other portions of the game. I think it would be awesome if the dev team released the vmf files so we could customize them if we choose to.</p>
