    <description>Anybody else think it would be cool to take some of the areas of the facility that we don&#39;t see before the Resonance Cascade (like Sector B, Office Complex, Biodome Complex, etc.) and try to imagine what they would look like pre-disaster?</description>

<p>Would be great to visit the facility without all the enemies, but just with scientists working, discussing stuff,…</p>
<p>Some kind of RPG</p>

<p>Could that be made into some kind of mod?</p>

            <p>Sounds like you’re gonna have to make Stormy go back and slave away at a pre-disaster MP QE map.</p>

            <p>I always wanted to see Chris Horns whole QE. All those closed doors and the entrance into the facility from the tunnel plus the aquatics area… Sadly it was not ever completed.</p>

            <p>If I had any mapping talent and knowledge, I’d love to take the already made maps and edited them to be pre-disaster.</p>
<p>It’s not going to happen, though.  I don’t know how to map and I have too much on my plate to devote the time to learning.</p>

            <p>Lambdabunker originally was going to be pre-disaster, but we decided against it.</p>
<p>I’ll look and see if I can find some old shots of it.</p>
