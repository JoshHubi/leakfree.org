    <title>Massive CSS Framerate Drop</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/massive-css-framerate-drop/6784</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know what the problem is with CSS, I normally run it at medium setting with about 60 FPS, and it just suddenly dropped to 4 FPS no matter what I do to the settings.

I don&#39;t know if this could have anything to do with it, but I just recently transferred my Steam Cloud settings over to it before playing it, so that might be the problem somehow. Any help?</description>

<p>Maybe not in this case but I can often narrow it down from the specs, even if it runs fine usually, people always forget to post their specs, or they just post their OS. I’m not gonna say “OMG UPGRADE” because my own PC is several years old now and yet it runs crysis2 at 30 and bulletstorm at 60fps.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I forgot to check the thread, my bad. And why the fuck would you be whining about my specs if I just told you up above that it works on medium with about 60 FPS. No idea what the problem was, but I restarted my computer and that fixed it. No idea why.</p>

            <p>Have you tried any other games? If this is happening in all of your games, then it’s probably a GPU failure of some kind. Technology doesn’t age as well as you would think.</p>
<p>If it’s only relevant to CS: Source, have you recently updated any drivers? Did you accidentally change the render mode in the options?</p>
