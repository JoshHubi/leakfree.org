    <description>I&#39;ve seen people create custom songs on Rock Band from real songs (i.e. [i]America: Fuck Yeah[/i]), using crystal clear audio quality and notes that reflect the structure of the song, but I&#39;ve never learned how to do it myself . Anybody actually know how to do this, or are the  YouTube videos of songs just loads of shit?</description>

            <p>On Wii you can easily do it using Homebrew and a program called RawkSD. Not sure how to do it on other platforms though.</p>
<p>If you’ve got the instruments, you’re better off using Frets on Fire on your PC. Not only are there more songs that you’ll ever find in the depths of the Homebrew world, they’ll probably work better too.</p>

<p>Through normal means, (“normal” meaning what Harmonix wants you to do,) you are not able to create Rock Band songs. They do however want to release a tool to let players create their own songs later on, they’re just waiting for “that tool.”</p>

<p>It’s called Rock Band Network and it already exists. You can learn more here: <a href="https://creators.rockband.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://creators.rockband.com</a></p>
<p>The ones that have been made up until now have probably been made using a bunch of PC software and hacked consoles. I looked into it a while back for making guitar hero custom songs, that’s how those were done so the rock band ones were probably made using something similar.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure how to do it myself, but there are programs to make charts for the songs, and I would suppose that they’d just upload the mp3 of the song along with it.</p>
