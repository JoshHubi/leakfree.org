    <description>Hey guys, i got another help thread for you d:

K so, at my high school, we have a wireless connection for the school that is used only for the school computers (they&#39;re all macs).
Although the signal is WEP secured, getting the password, or getting passed the encryption hasn&#39;t been much of a problem.

The thing is, is that somehow, they were able to track my laptop (probably by seeing which router i was connected to, because there are multiple ones for different sections of my school). I got in a butt load of trouble, and told me i would have to pay a fine if they caught me again (which they probably won&#39;t, but w/e d: )

So my question is how i can stay completely invisible on a network, even when file sharing, and all those other computer discovery methods are turned off. 
If it helps, the brain of my school&#39;s operations is a mac server d: I

Sorry for the tl;dr (;</description>

            <p>You don’t have to ruin the mac! Take the mac address, shut the mac down, (i.e off the network) and spoof your own! Whats your schools email? I might tell them to start using ACL’s! If your not supposed to use outside equipment on the network, ACL’s should be implemented.</p>

            <p>You guys must have misunderstood me d:</p>
<p>First of all, i meant macbooks d: and the new macs (not the old tv looking ones)<br>
Also, i decided to go with spoofing a mac adress by destroying one of the macbooks. (i’m already writing a terminal file that wipes the hard drive, and short circuits other important devices, such as the network card.)</p>
<p>And for the record, i’m not using a macbook (i have an ASUS) and its not that i cant “play games” or “go on facebook”. Simply being on the network and not doing anything will get me the famed “Internet fine” from my principal.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks a bunch guys, i’ll give a heads up on the mission once i complete it, or fail it(;</p>

            <p>as was said a few posts above, spoof mac address to one already on the network<br>
and connect to a vpn, just host one on ur pc at home so all traffic will look identical to the server admins (all theyll see is u acccessing ur home IP, which they shouldnt recognize as yours)</p>

            <p>crash one of the macs so the network card doesn’t work<br>
on laptop: disable DHCP (enter ip manually)<br>
spoof MAC address (put the one of the computer in step 1)<br>
don’t use your school’s DNS server (use opendns)<br>
use linux to avoid windows file sharing breaking your cover</p>
<p>and if they catch you again, get a netbook for 99$ and leave it on the DeAuth attack, hidden somewhere in the school, so nobody can use wireless as long as they’re in range of the netbook</p>

            <p>Impossible to become invisible.<br>
Possible to become some one else.</p>
<p>If you are using their internet you are connecting to them. You cant prank call some one and have then pick up and not realize that some one is calling. The best thing you can do is change your phone number to some one they know and try to talk in a normal voice.</p>
<p>Spoof your mac address so that it is the same or similar to the computers that are allowed on the network, then use a ssh tunnel to a home or remote server to encrypt you session. They will see you connect, they will either think you are a student mac book, and they will see you connect to a remote server, but thats it. Wont be able to tell what sites you visit whether it’s flaming BM or tarding it up on /b/.</p>

            <p>They’re not routers, they are access points.</p>
<p>You will be getting your IP from somewhere, most likely a DHCP server. They will be able to see your NIC in the scope, and from there it’s easy as pie to track you down.</p>
<p>Change your MAC address to 00DEADBEEF00 for lulz, though.</p>

<p>I used a mac once in 1st grade when they were relativly new. Fucking pieces of garbage. It’s like playing with a microwave, it’s fun at first, but you don’t want to do it for more than 10 minutes.</p>

            <p>My High School used PCs. So I probably can’t help you there.</p>
<p>EDIT:I’ve been looking it up and I can’t seem to find anything on it without too much of my time. Why are you trying to do this?</p>
<p>Don’t you have your own password since your a student – and why are you filesharing?</p>
