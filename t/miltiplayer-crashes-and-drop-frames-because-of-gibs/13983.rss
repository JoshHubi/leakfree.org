    <title>Miltiplayer crashes and drop frames because of gibs?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/miltiplayer-crashes-and-drop-frames-because-of-gibs/13983</link>
    <description>I played in multiplayer for hours and seems like everyone struggles with random crashes and fps drops. On bm_bounce map, where everything is visible I also got some warning on screen, &quot;Overflow RenderSomething 7&quot; right before it crashes. I have an idea, that this is because of gibs, thats stays forever or just too long. Is there a console command to change this timeout to prove my theory?
And also, thank you for that nice game and awesome multiplayer   :stuck_out_tongue:  

I&#39;ll attach my latest dumps, maybe it can help.

            <p>I got it again - it was “Overflow RenderablesList group 7” and game was really slow (FPS), before it crashes. Other player was disconnected too, before me (not simultaneously).<br>
Usially it happens when players using  lot of grenades and other weapons, that makes models explode.<br>
This is seriuos, i don’t understand why nobody writes nothing about this, I’m crashed like 3 times in last 5 minutes and I see in chat that every couple minutes sombody disconnecting because of error, and reconnecting again.</p>
