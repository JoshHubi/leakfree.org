            <p>So it’s taken a bit longer than we expected but “Half-Life: Portal to Black Mesa” has a release date of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n71RJM16UW8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">6/17/11</a></p>
<p>So yeah, we may have been running on “Valve time” a bit but I think in the end it was worth the extra production time. Can’t wait for everyone to see it!</p>

<p>Whoa whoa… this sure looks interesting. If you can incorporate the subtle and the not so subtle Valve humor, it’s a guaranteed recipe for success.<br>
Gman’s voice actor is perfect, I was already laughing even before there was anything to see.</p>
<p>It’s not much of an issue if he holds it wrong only for a couple of seconds, it only adds to point out his clumsiness. And this comment also does a good job at showing how detail crazed and nit-picky the Half-Life community (or Black Mesa community for that matter) has become over the time. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing or anything but I think it’s worth taking a jab at and see people get worked up over the little thing while the video has to be taken as a parody.</p>
<p>When I think about it there are just so many things in Half-Life you can make fun of (Ross Scott already covered some of it) it’s hard to run out of ideas.</p>

<p>Yes, we’ve discovered the same thing in the gaming community. After releasing the trailer and seeing just how much attention and scrutiny the 41 sec trailer has come under we decided to re-film two scenes and to give more of what we feel fans will like more and cut some of what we think is “fluff”. I will say that Gordon holding the crowbar facing towards him is pretty much just in that one shot and the rest of the film he is holding it the same way he is in the game.  Hope that helps. We have a rough edit finished right now so we are working on special effects, sound, ect and hope the film will be up in about two weeks. Take care!</p>

            <p>I would like to point out for future filming and episodes: Have <span class="bbcode-i">Gordon</span> hold the crowbar the correct way facing front instead of holding it backwards. It just bugged me.</p>
<p>And no offense to the young gman actor, he seems capable of the role, but a much older actor playing that character would fir way better and sound better too. Gman is like around 40 to 50 years old. Not 20.</p>
<p>other than that, Good stuff. I like the half-life humor you used too:<br>
<em>Randomly bludgeoning helpless scientist to death with crowbar</em>  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Theres something I want to point out here, Gordon looks a tad different… I think his HEV suit got bleached err something… oh wait he isn’t even wearing one at all! &amp; I was about to say he got a new haircut! Sarcasm aside, I think this will be an amazing video! That elevator scene made me laugh, which is rare.</p>
