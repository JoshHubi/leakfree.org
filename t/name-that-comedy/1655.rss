    <title>Name that Comedy!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/name-that-comedy/1655</link>
    <description>I felt the cold ground tremble beneath my feet as I stepped from the blackness of the ship. The groan of the surrounding earth made me pause for reflection- was my goal truly noble? Was all the carnage worth it? I couldn&#39;t decide, so I gulped down a vial of some triptocaine laced with arsenic, and immediately stopped hallucinating my feet. I realized suddenly, with a clear head, that I wasn&#39;t walking across the arid landscape of my nightmares, but instead being dragged along the bottom of a gully by my neckbones, hooked to metal tentacles, writhing in the ash. &quot;Ha!&quot; I said, watching a woman buried to her neck in the gray matter of children&#39;s bashed in braingluck roll her eyes back into her head feverishly and begin eating her way out. &quot;I could sure use a hypodermic suppository analgesic to ease the screaming sensation coming out of this lump of baby.&quot; I rub my temples gently.

<p>It’s rather amusing you have played the ‘social life’ card in just about every <span class="bbcode-i">internet altercation</span> you’ve found yourself in. While the irony in itself probably consumes you and makes you want to curl into a little ball like the pussy you are, I’ll continue to elaborate on how much of an insignificant little shit you are. You claim that I have no intellect yet it’s rather obvious my grammatical capability meets, and by far exceeds your own. It’s also rather clear that you cannot form a valid rebuttal for anything I have said to you, hence why the only offensive you’ve come up with thus far is “you have no life”. Maybe you’ll realize that telling someone they are a detriment to society for picking pointless arguments, and then arguing with them, makes you no better than them.</p>
<p>I have never claimed once yet that my superior physical conditioning and ability puts me above anyone here. I do not need to try to be something I already am, and leaving would simply make being a worthless being far too easy for you and your friends here.</p>
<p>Oh, now the angsty teenager decides to pull out the cock jokes he so eagerly waited to use while furiously rubbing his own dick with a dousing of Corn Husker’s and the broken condom used during his conception. Perhaps one of these days you’ll realize how insignificant you really are to the world and off yourself.</p>

<p>And explain to us how you are miraculously god’s gift to the world.  The only one here untainted by the apparent stupidity abound.</p>
<p>When you stop pumping your iron and filling your veins with steroids to look pretty for competitions that have no standing or importance in, you know, real life, and when you stop banging $5 hookers cause the $10 have to much class to touch you, maybe you’ll see how ironic all your statements are.</p>
<p>You mean nothing to society as a whole.  How are you a benefit to the human race?  Don’t nonchalantly say “by not being a moron, lol” cause none of us really are.  Let’s narrow it down, and then work up to the big picture.  How do you even benefit the country?</p>

<p>It’s rather amusing you have played the ‘social life’ card in just about every <span class="bbcode-i">internet altercation</span> you’ve found yourself in.

<p>Aww, is the little boy butthurt because he no longer has an internet buddy to cuddle with? Sorry pal, things change. I’m no longer going to be here to pick your fucking flowers and send you candy wrapped in boxes with pretty pink bows. Your opinion means absolutely nothing to me because you, with the majority of the rest of this forum, are naught but cretins. You’re a stain on the seat of the ass of society; you serve as nothing other than an unfortunate little accident to be laughed at and used as an example of how not to be if you wish to be successful. I’m afraid to tell you that I will not powder your asscheeks and wrap your diaper. Instead I will make you drown in the pool of shit that is your own social sorrow and decay.</p>
