    <description>Hello
One of my favourite moment in Half Life is when we are dropped in the garbage by soldiers. We wake up, we have only a few seconds to realize what&#39;s happening, to see how you can manage how to get out of there, and to do it.
There is a similar sequence in Opposing Force : we are stucked in a room with green lava, and this lava is going up. We have to act quickly, climb the ladder, until we can go out. Under the eyes of the G-man, by the way...


So, I am describing this because I find these moments are simply [b]great[/b]. And if I don&#39;t make any mistake, there are not many sequences like this in HL1,2 &amp; mods.
And in fact, HL1 (and other) looks sometimes like a &quot;stroll&quot;, a &quot;promenade&quot;... We walk, then we go back to take a medikit, we take time to destroy every crates... Doesn&#39;t look like emergency escape, hu ?
Even in HL2: ep2 by example, in almost the end, there is an emergency in the rebel base : alarm, red light, voices, etc. But we know that we can take as much time as we want, we will arrive just in time (or just too late...) whatever we do...  :wink: 

So my suggestion is to transform [b]some HL1 sequences in time-limited sequences[/b] in Black Mesa Source.  :slight_smile: 
Examples :

*  There could be a sliding door closing slowly - the player understand naturally that he has to go through, and it gives some adrenalin, and helps to feel an emergency atmosphere.
*   Or in an emergency situation, with red light, alarm, etc, we could hear a voice saying &quot;10 minutes left before overheating of the reactor&quot;, then &quot;5 minutes&quot; etc...
*   (I can suggest other situations if you&#39;re searching for ideas)

Naturally there should be large enough time to do the action - it is only something to speed the player.


So, what is your opinion about that ?
It doesn&#39;t look very hard to implement, and for me it could improve the game experience ?


PS: sorry if it has already been suggested, I don&#39;t have looked all the topics in the forum, and since there has been a crash, I can&#39;t check.
PPS: I am not english, so if there is something that you don&#39;t understand, just ask  :slight_smile: [/SIZE]</description>

            <p>The walls of the box smashing room should start crushing together when you get in it. It will be cool! Plus, it would make the room even more illogical than it was before. I’m all for that! BM developers, make sure to make the already illogical rooms in the game even more illogical, if you can’t find a way to make them make sense. Maybe they should make the walls crush together when you finish the room, as a Freeman’s mind tribute. The boxes should explode when they are crushed.</p>

            <p>Timed sequences should not be implemented into the game, I don’t think. That would make it too different from the original. I liked being able to explore without consequence, and the find all the different little weapons caches and stuff. As for timed sequences for the weapons caches themselves, that doesn’t make sense. I always hated doors that were timed in games, like on Gears of War at the start. Why would you have a button located at Point A, which opens a door at Point B in plain sight of Point A, which would then close again in a few seconds. You’d never find that anywhere in real life. I realize on GoW that it is strictly for training purposes to teach you to sprint, but this has no place in Black Mesa.</p>

<p>When I played Ep 2 I naturally sped up when the Combine began assaulting the base, even though I knew I didn’t have to. I got a sense of excitement but at the same time wasn’t forced to make concessions to get somewhere quicker than I needed to.</p>

<p>Talking about “Secondary silo ambush”, didn’t it frustrate you / annoy you that Magnusson kept mocking you / commanding you around no matter how quickly you proceeded through the danger-filled sections?</p>

<p>I’ve actually grown to dislike the Lamda Reactor section purely because of the time constraint on it. I prefer to play more tactically so sprinting around trying to kill all those Controllers doesn’t suit me well at all.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, there was no time constraint <span class="bbcode-i">per se</span>, in fact you were just protecting the scientist opening the portal.<br>
The only time-limit in there was that you had to enter the portal in the 10 or 15 seconds window, but that’s hardly “scene with time limit”.</p>
<p>========</p>
<p>But the Secondary silo incident actually gave me an idea: What if instead of fake or real time limits, the dialogues / announcements / radio chatter reflected how fast or slow you were in a particular area? Or similarly: Why do Rebels tell you “Wow, Gordon, you really put on a clinic!” in the Hunter-Chopper showdown sequence, EVEN IF YOU DON’T actually get the “Puttin’ on a clinic” achievement this time? It would be better if they said “Awesome! You really hit it with every mine!” in case you managed it, and they’d say “Wow, glad you finally disposed of it, I was starting to lose faith in you”, if it takes you 20 attempts (and 10 dead rebels around)… ?</p>

            <p>Personally I’m all for slowly closing doors/hatches whatever, as long as they don’t get frustrating, or differ the game too much from the original Half-Life… On the note of frustration, I would NOT enjoy “do this in bla bla minutes, or you lose” because I’ve always hated that sort of bullshit in games…</p>

            <p>There also have time limit when the portal to xen is finish but if you don’t get inside the portal, That machine will blow up causing game over.</p>
<p>and in the end, if you don’t enter the portal that gman open for in some time, you also get a bad ending.</p>

            <p>I would not even mind if there were time-limited sequences in critical areas, like blast doors shutting down a corridor you need to go through. Just that there should be an alternative way of getting through, if the blast door does not open again. Stuff like that.</p>

            <p>I don’t agree with the original poster about the game being a “stroll”. The first time I played Half-Life, I always had adrenaline pumping. Sure enough, now that I’ve played it over and over countless times, it has become a stroll.</p>
<p>I like the idea of adding more timed sequences to gain extra ammo or for a shortcut. This worked well in HL2: Episode 2 when you had that rail car that slid into the abyss and you had to get the supply crates out.</p>
<p>I see where the original poster is going with this, but there already some “timed sequences” implemented in the original Half-Life. For example, triggering the blast doors in We’ve Got Hostiles and Jumping into the portal to Xen. In my opinion, taking down those controllers wasn’t that fun. I don’t really feel as if adding more timed sequences would add anything to the game.</p>

<p>Or in an emergency situation, with red light, alarm, etc, we could hear a voice saying “10 minutes left before overheating of the reactor”, then “5 minutes” etc…</p>
<p>Naturally there should be large enough time to do the action - it is only something to speed the player.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Things like this would fit really well in Half Life, where the player is meant to be able to go through the game how they want. Things like alarms and emergency messages are designed to speed up the player, but not actually force time limits upon them.</p>
<p>When I played Ep 2 I naturally sped up when the Combine began assaulting the base, even though I knew I didn’t have to. I got a sense of excitement but at the same time wasn’t forced to make concessions to get somewhere quicker than I needed to.</p>
<p>I’ve actually grown to dislike the Lamda Reactor section purely because of the time constraint on it. I prefer to play more tactically so sprinting around trying to kill all those Controllers doesn’t suit me well at all.</p>
<p>All in all I’d say adding in these timed sequences would make some people happy, but irritate some too. If you like the idea of running against the clock just imagine you only have 5 minutes to get somewhere. Surely your imagination hasn’t been completely destroyed by games and television?</p>
