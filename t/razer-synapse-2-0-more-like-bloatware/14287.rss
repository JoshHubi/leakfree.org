    <title>Razer Synapse 2.0 more like bloatware</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/razer-synapse-2-0-more-like-bloatware/14287</link>
    <description>I read about how it was making people&#39;s systems boot up slower. I
originally bought a ssd to run windows, simply because I was getting
super slow boot times on this pc. Now I know why it was so slow.


Now I out of curiosity, decided to uninstall the program, because I only
use a razer deathadder, and that thing works just fine off of windows
drivers. So I uninstall, restart the system, and my boot time is cut
literally in half.


What the hell?


I run on windows 7 64 bit premium. Can&#39;t wait for windows 10 because
then I can enable fast boot. Right now, it&#39;s seconds from starting the
computer and landing right into windows. Need that so I can quickly get
into doing work when I&#39;m in a hurry.


At least I got one thing positive to say from using Razer Synapse 2.0.
It made me frustrated enough to go out and buy a ssd that now makes my
computer perform better than anything else I had used before. Now I know
why Linus Tech Tips says, always have a computer with windows installed
on a ssd. Literally makes your computer fun to enjoy. Now enjoying that
speed more so without Razer Synapse 2.0. Love the mouse btw, feels
great in my hand, black light, and it doesn&#39;t have any loud clicking
noises. Really well built mouse. Too bad about the software though. So
glad I didn&#39;t buy one of their stupid mmo razer gaming mouses.</description>

<p>Came back to check up on this thread. And this right here is good news to me and anybody else who uses this and is frustrated with startup times. Yay!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I assume you mean switch it to Manual Crypt.</p>
<p>Disabling services is not something I’m experienced with on Windows 7 of late, never had to disable a few of them, there’s plenty of guides out there, google a few, the same goes if you’ve got an NVIDIA card, disabling some of the useless services (such as streaming) can save A LOT on RAM and give you a faster boot time.</p>
<p>I personally recommend Blackviper (like I said haven’t done the tweaking in years, so I can’t recommend a setup).</p>

            <p>How about you just disable it on startup? I use the hell out of it and find it to be an incredibly useful piece of software. Can be be slow to startup, but it’s certainly worth the extra few seconds.</p>
