    <title>What IS Half-Life 3</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-half-life-3/8940</link>
    <description>I was reading these on [url=&#39;combineoverwiki.net&#39;]Combine Overwiki[/url] and it really sparked my interest:
[quote]
On April 19, Portal 2 is released. The same day, The Final Hours of Portal 2 is released. In it, author Geoff Keighley states that Portal 2 is probably Valve&#39;s last game with an isolated single-player experience. This is misunderstood by many members of the community as the simple end of single-player games made by Valve, which is negated by Gabe Newell in a May interview, in which he states that Valve is not done with single-player games, but rather done with single-player games as we know them today, and that they will transform into &quot;single-player plus&quot; games, thus single-player games with social components added to them. He reckons that entertainment is inherently increased in value by having it be social, letting people play with their friends, and recognizing that they are connected with other people, and that they have to work on adding this to their single-player games.[30]
[/quote]

[quote]
In another May interview, Newell states that Valve is done with the episodic model as we know it, now rather updating the same game as much as they want through Steam, which was introduced with Team Fortress 2.[31] This suggests that the next Half-Life game will not be in the vein of its two predecessors, leading the community to speculate that Valve has moved to a larger project.
[/quote]
I know we basically know nothing about Half-Life 3, but I&#39;m just kind of trying to sort this out.  So according to the above sources, Gabe said that they&#39;re moving to &quot;single player plus&quot; games?  With &quot;social components added to them?&quot;  So what exactly do you think this means?  The only thing that comes to mind is that either, HL3 will have more a more expansive multiplayer component, or that the entire game will feature some kind of co-op.  I&#39;m definitely up for multiplayer, but I really don&#39;t think that co-op in the main campaign is very fun.  After all, Gordon is the messianic [b][i]One[/i][/b] [i]Freeman[/i] right?  And I can&#39;t help think of how many annoying (and sometimes drunk) people I play with in L4D.  Anyone have any theories on this?

And onto the second quote, this seems kind of interesting.  So Gabe&#39;s saying they&#39;re moving onto shorter cycles?  Again, two more things come to mind: One, Half-Life 3 will literally be some kind of nonstop content game where we&#39;ll get a new mission or chapter each week (don&#39;t know, sounds kind of weird) or, with DLC becoming more and more common, we&#39;ll see little missions tacked onto the game after the initial release of the main HL3 storyline is complete.  I would like that but on one condition: It would be a different main character that we don&#39;t see much of, or we never see at all in the main story.  Such as a resistance member.

I don&#39;t know, with everything Valve&#39;s been saying (especially along with the harsh development cycle stuff) makes me to believe that HL3 is going to be [b][i]very[/i][/b] different as far as the general the way the game is updated and provided, as well as the way we play it.  Not sure if I like it too much.  But I have full faith in anyone, it&#39;s Valve.</description>

<p>A lot of this has been talked about before. Frankly, I’m as nervous as anybody, but never does it state that we will be forced to interact with other people; Valve is smart enough to avoid that, I think.</p>
<p>As long as the game is as good and fun as its predecessors, I’ll be happy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if they tied the idea of downloadable chapters in with the story of the Perpetual Testing Initiative from Portal 2. If the Borealis contains the universe-hopping technology that made that plotline possible, the Combine would want the ship to contact their own multi-dimensional empire. If used by Gordon, it could accidentally lead to him being sent to any on of infinite universes, that could have their own settings, creatures, physics, weapons etc. Each chapter could take place in a new universe with it’s own self-contained short story to it, always ending with Gordon hopping over to the next one.</p>
<p>In short; Half-Life 3 could be Sliders: The Videogame.</p>

<p>You know, I’m a little late to the party, but that would be a pretty fucking awesome premise to make into a HL2 Mod.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they want to make Half-Life a “service” instead of simply doing the episodes or in full-length titles, what they could do is make Left-4-Dead styled free DLC campaigns that they could release on a regular basis. I doubt this could ever happen since the words “regular” &amp; “frequent” aren’t part of their vocabulary.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if they tied the idea of downloadable chapters in with the story of the Perpetual Testing Initiative from Portal 2. If the Borealis contains the universe-hopping technology that made that plotline possible, the Combine would want the ship to contact their own multi-dimensional empire. If used by Gordon, it could accidentally lead to him being sent to any on of infinite universes, that could have their own settings, creatures, physics, weapons etc. Each chapter could take place in a new universe with it’s own self-contained short story to it, always ending with Gordon hopping over to the next one.</p>
<p>In short; Half-Life 3 could be Sliders: The Videogame.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>More likely they would only use the universe-hopping to explain why there is suddenly another Gordon fighting beside you when someone joins your game (as well as a plot point for why you need to take the Borealis from the Combine). Though, don’t get me wrong, Sliders: The Videogame sounds kind of cool.</p>

            <p>I didn’t mean for there to be a connection between the two points. I’m not basing my idea that they’re doing nothing on the fact that they haven’t communicated, I’m just saying I don’t think they’re doing anything – and it is a fact that neither of us really know anything.</p>

<p>Well -to be honest- neither of us know anything. I’m sure it gets worked on in small portions by employees who finish their quota of work on other games and have time to squeeze in some Half Life 3 concepts.</p>
<p>I doubt a foundation has even been thrown at developers. I’m pretty sure Marc and Wolpaw are conversing with Newell about what to do, and keep giving little ideas and concepts to their art designers and game-mechanics developers (ad-libbing) to try out. This testing and idea exchanging has probably been going on for a while, so they probably have something, but with them still not working on it completely, I doubt it’s getting done.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t understand the jump in logic from, “They haven’t shown the public anything” to "They must not be working consistently on it.</p>
<p>I guarantee that the next Half-Life installment is not some side-project they think about whenever they get a chance. They have enough people employed to be working on several things at once. It has been their development choice from the very beginning to keep silent about the next Half-Life game. This doesn’t mean they have nothing done.</p>

<p>Not in fantasy land, no. In real life land, Valve is typically a company that releases flagship games across all platforms. Even after the TF2 funk they’ve been releasing every title to the 360.</p>
<p>Plus, you know damn well they’d be missing out monetarily if they skipped a console.</p>

            <p>I’m still partial to the stealth element idea which was presented in another HL3 related thread. I thought it’d be cool to sneak up on a combine and choke them out with the crowbar.</p>

<p>I know we basically know nothing about Half-Life 3, but I’m just kind of trying to sort this out.  So according to the above sources, Gabe said that they’re moving to “single player plus” games?  With “social components added to them?”  So what exactly do you think this means?  The only thing that comes to mind is that either, HL3 will have more a more expansive multiplayer component, or that the entire game will feature some kind of co-op.  I’m definitely up for multiplayer, but I really don’t think that co-op in the main campaign is very fun.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The way I was thinking about this I got interested in other games with a combined singleplayer/coop experience such as Mass Effect 3 whereby the better performance by you in the coop component was supposed to provide you with a better singleplayer ending. Off course that ultimately fell flat when it turned out a majority of players found the end more or less underwhelming, any way you accomplished it.</p>
<p>And then there is the upcoming game, Black Ops 2. In the game you have side missions that you undertake that, depending on the outcome, determines the kind of feedback you receive in the story. Apparently for example, if you are tasked in assasinating a target in one of those side missions, but you fail in doing so, that target will appear in the end game as a threat.</p>
<p>I have a feeling Half Life may take the same root as the two above. Gman has always mocked the player about choice being an illusion. With Gordon Freeman (player) that may be the case. But what about resistance members? Does Gman consider their presence to be a hindrance or an asset to Gmans and Gordon’s plans, does he even consider the advantages or disadvantages of the choices they make on a daily basis?</p>
<p>What if Coop players take control of Resistance soldiers, with a seperate story that takes place 24+ hours before the singleplayer game takes place. The choice they take (Choice: Protect a weapons cache or Assault a Combine stronghold) will effect how the story plays out in Singleplayer. Every player will have access to the core singleplayer experience, however if the player wants a unique singleplayer each time, they can unlock a part of the story through coop as an ‘unlockable’ achievement. Whenever they play a new game, they have a choice to plug in those unlockable achievement to access subtle or aven advantagous changes to the singleplayer experience.</p>

            <p>I’m not really worried about EP3’s gameplay… That whole thing about single-player plus, or different kinds of gameplay, or whatever- I get the feeling it’s not really applicable to HL. Valve knows that it’s fans like HL’s gameplay, and they aren’t going to make radical changes to it in EP3/HL3. It just wouldn’t be Half Life anymore if they did and they know it.</p>
<p>As for adding new things, like in P2, that I would expect. (Maybe a new weapon or device Dr. Kleiner has in the closet somewhere at White Forest.)</p>
<p>I also would place my bets on it being EP3, and not HL3. EP2’s ending doesn’t really wrap things up, and it seems hardly the place to jump into HL3. If HL was a TV show (just an analogy, folks), it’s the sort of ending where you’d expect a “tune in next episode for the exciting conclusion!” message. It’s also very sad- it’s certainly not the tone in which I’d expect HL2 to end. That tone would be either something scary/creepy, or something right after a disaster. Considering that mystery device on the Borealis, I’d expect the disaster ending for EP3.</p>
<p>Now, maybe I’m wrong- maybe it’s been long enough (and the graphics will be different enough) to justifiably be called HL3… goodness Valve. I could go in an endless loop here.</p>
<p>My point is that HL’s going to be HL as we know it, and I don’t think we should be worried about some weird drastic change. Maybe Valve’s other games will be different, but not HL. They know better…</p>
