    <description>I just got to play a little of the MP and it was freakin&#39; awesome. Some of the best graphics I have ever seen in a video game. I cannot wait to buy it</description>

<p>Crysis 2 is a good game in and of itself, but kind of like HL2 I expect the modding community to flourish after awhile. Speaking of which, there was a Half-Life 2 mod that changed engines to one of the Cryengines… I think it was Cryengine 3, but not sure. The mod is called Raindrop I believe.</p>

            <p>And the DX11 features don’t exactly have the best of implementation either. Tessellation looks nice on some things, but some objects it doesn’t even change them at all, except tessellation is still applied, so you get objects that have a hard polygonal edge with hundreds of extra polys arranged in the <span class="bbcode-i">same exact way</span> to make that hard polygonal edge - and it also tessellates the water which looks great - but it still renders the water even when terrain or objects are blocking the players view from it.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why, CE2 had a working culling system for this stuff so what you get is a huge performance dip where some things look leagues better, but others look marginally better or not at all.</p>

            <p>The problem is that the engine might be amazing but they’re not taking advantage of it. I mean Crysis 2 didn’t even support DX11 until quite a while after it was released.</p>

            <p>CryEngine 3 is pretty epic though. I use it to create non-gaming related environments just for fun and occasionally for school projects.</p>
<p>Also when I want a quick render of an atmospheric or environmental video or something that I don’t feel like opening up a 3D modeling program for. A WYSIWYG engine with good graphics and a frame-dump feature is always handy to have.</p>

            <p>I’m considering it as well (yes, I don’t own it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) but I want to ask for anyone who owns it - how many people still play the MP on PC? I don’t want to get it and be stuck with 15 servers like Crysis 1 because people only care about the single player.</p>

<p>Still though, everything they have done now surpasses the atrocity that was Far Cry’s voice acting. That game…it was one of those “so bad it’s good” when it comes to VA.</p>
<p>Seriously, the main guy had absolutely no emotion whatsoever. And those mercenaries and their lines:</p>
<p>“YOUR ASS IS GRASS”</p>
<p>“I’LL FIX HIS LITTLE RED WAGON”</p>

            <p>I excuse Hargreeve’s voice in Crysis 2 because of what he is, but I  have been pretty vocal “hurr” about how Crysis 1, 2, and Crytek games in general has had some of the worst fucking voice acting in any AAA title. I’m especially disappointed in Kevin Fly–eh, Nathan Gould’s voice. It fits the part so damn well, but he just never delivers a single line appropriately. I’m pretty sure it’s all because of shitty direction. In fact, that would explain it given Crytek’s VO track record.</p>
<p>My personal favorite has got to be “My chute’s gone… my. damn chute is gone…  I’ve got no main, no reserve…”</p>
<p>Only well voiced character imo is psycho because he’s so over the top and counterbalances everyone else’s dryness. Too bad he was written out.</p>

            <p>I actually used to think the same way about the SP but my opinion comes from when I stopped comparing it to the first game mainly. Now one thing I don’t get is how people found Crysis’s voice acting bad, and barely anyone mentions Crysis 2s. Some of it is really bad, especially the soldiers using the really thick-but-fake sounding accents in the beginning (What the heyull!) And that old guy sounds like he has a lump in his throat at time. Sure Crysis 1’s wasn’t phenomenal but it was no means bad.</p>

<p>The SP is pretty good, a little too straightforward with the tutorials at times, and not as nonlinear as crysis 1 but still more open then a lot of other games, MP is alright, but it’s basically CoD with superpowers and nice graphics, but like Crysis 1 the mod tools are pretty powerful and more custom maps are starting to spring up.</p>
<p>It’s probably worth it unless your sure you wouldn’t like the MP and you don’t care about SP</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My opinion is a bit different, I am an avid fan of Crysis 1, and absolutely despise the boring linearity of Crysis 2’s single player campaign. I’m one of those people that enjoy COD-eque multiplayer occasionally, and Crysis 2’s MP improved on that significantly IMO and was very fun.</p>

<p>Another side note as I progress through the game (just finished Dead Man Walking) - why, oh why, can you not reload the extra +1 weapons unless you’re fired more than 1 round?  Realistically, for say, the SCAR, it’s a 40 shot clip +1 in the chamber…so once you insert a new magazine and operate the action, it should technically be 39 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber, allowing you to fit one more in the magazine.  And this worked fine in Crysis 1…alas, not in Crysis 2.  I find myself shooting 2 rounds and reloading when I’m near an ammo crate, just to stay topped off.</p>

            <p>You can actually avoid using vehicles, but it’s much harder that way. I also noticed some strange glitches, like some props that change their size when hit.</p>

            <p>Crytek announced that they are working on a DX11 patch:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>We would like to announce that there will be a DX11 patch released for Crysis 2. We are working to get the best out of DX11, so we’ll wait to announce the features until a little closer to release.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I hope they are not kidding with us. I highly doubt that this patch will be half assed. A lot of universities here in germany already use the cryengine 2 to do professional studies with it and Crytek also wants the engine to be used in many different areas too. I think the final engine will blow everything away.</p>
