    <title>Blast Pit Loads Player Outside Map</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blast-pit-loads-player-outside-map/14546</link>
    <description>Hello, when going down to the lower part, to turn on the power I think, when turning around this corner
[img=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/1Fc5OcB.jpg&#39;,left][/img] it starts to load, and once loaded, loads me outside of the map, as shown here.
[img=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/rR8paut.jpg&#39;,left][/img]The console also proceeds to give me this output right afterwards, not sure if it&#39;s important, but I&#39;m including it in case it is. Also, despite saying that I&#39;d see a crash, I do not.

<p>Yes I also have this issue I was playing this part when the last update came in, After that I noticed that all NPCs were frozen including the tentacle creature. the game is still playable until you get to that load point. been trying to remedy for 2 weeks now. about the only thing I have not done is start a new game. But I have gone back to a point where nothing is frozen but the issue still returns at that load point.</p>

</aside>
<p>Here is the simple fix.Go to New Game and restart an unlocked chapter.</p>
<p>You have the AI Disabled glitch, this is caused by new game updates being incompatible with Old saved games.<br>
It is a failing of the Source Engine.</p>
<p>The Steam Black Mesa Community Discussions has several posts on this problem.</p>

<p>Yes this worked for me.<br>

            <p>I came here to find out how to fix the problem, but nowone is commenting. ;(</p>
<p>And your graphics look better than mine. I tried nocliping but it wont work.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Tried a little more exploring with noclip and found where you spawn.  ||</p>
