    <description>Hey everyone! 
I&#39;m sorry for some self promoting, but the newest project I am currently involved with needs some help. 

If you can take a moment to look over what we currently have working that would be lovely. 

If you guys have any other questions, insults, criticism, then please feel free to comment.

New World Interactive is in the final stages of its next big title, Insurgency 2. Insurgency 2 is a multiplayer FPS (First Person Shooter) with a gameplay style best characterized as high speed tactical. The game features quick action yet retains a strong emphasis on realism in its environments and gameplay. The game is a sequel to the popular free-to-play, total conversion mod for Half-Life 2 entitled Insurgency. Featuring an ultra-realistic style of play based on real world locations in an ongoing war in Iraq, Insurgency was downloaded a million times in the first week of launch alone.

Insurgency 2 recently launched a Kickstarter campaign and really needs your support to complete the game. As many of you know, Kickstarter and similar crowd-funding campaigns have reinvigorated the development community. I would really appreciate you taking a look at this campaign - I would appreciate it even more if you could make a donation to the program:

If you are unable to make a donation, please forward this note to others who might consider giving for the completion of this game while helping a tremendously talented development team.

            <p>I seriously think knives only king of the hill using actual hills as goals would be genius.</p>
<p>So far this is the best knife behavior I’ve seen in a shooter. I do kinda wish it wasn’t instakill though, or had a kind of bleed out feature. My unrealistic wish is a controllable slash direction and blocking ability  :s</p>

            <p>For some reason I was confusing my hatred of Resistance and Liberation’s controls with Insurgency’s. I don’t know how I mixed those two up, but I did. I tried playing a bit of Insurgency again &amp; found the aim to control quite well.</p>
<p>It did however run incredibly poorly &amp; needed to be at 640x480 in order to have a playable framerate.</p>

            <p>The one thing which comes to my mind while watching the video on your kickstarter is that the muzzle-flash from the weapons should illuminate the world. It would just make the game that much more immersive, and could add another layer of strategy, as firing a weapon on a dark map could give your position away to enemies.</p>

<p>James,</p>
<p>The criticism I have is that it’s just another shoot-em-up war game.<br>
There’s been plenty of those out there for years and I’m looking for something new to try. I’m sure it will have some success but, for me, I’m looking for something really creative new and exciting.</p>

</aside>
<p>We have been busy building a foundation for the game to get it in a workable state for our future goals. We have only announced KOTH and PUSH game modes but we have more interesting game modes in the works. We are also asking the community if they have any ideas on what you guys want to see in the mod since we are still in the very early stages.</p>
<p>Community support such as dedicated server, admin tools, and possibly plugin support is going to big focus as well.</p>

<p>Did I see an Mp-40 in that kickstarter video?</p>
<p>I was wondering when you’d post about this as I’d seen it on your blog for some time.</p>
<p>I would like to help, although i kinda have to watch my spending now as I’m currently unemployed and paying for college.</p>
<p>Though, for some reason this strikes me as the <span class="bbcode-i">perfect</span> game to integrate that oculus rift thing with. Support for that could definitely make this stand out even more. Of course this is just a simple suggestion, and I doubt you guys have the money if you need money right now, so feel free to ignore it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Yep, that is the mp40. We are tinkering with the idea that the insurgents are only able to obtain common older generation weapons from old caches found through the region and then some. While the security forces have your common military gear.</p>

<p>The free-aim ruins it for me that kind of thing’s only acceptable with a wiimote or similar.<br>
It also contrasts with the realism of the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I personally hate free-aim given my history as a old school fps shooter.</p>
<p>Unlike other source mods or games our weapons fire from the muzzle rather than the center of the screen. So in effect most of our weapons do not have an artificial spread. To provide a simple counter against hip shooting we have not only increased recoil but introduced free-aim. However, I am constantly tinkering with the system to ensure it works as expected while ensuring it angers me less as a twitch shooter ( such as ensuring it moves the screen a bit while moving in free-aim ).</p>

<p>The scope zoom looks awesome. The game looks very fun but it needs to do more to stand out of the crowd. I would love to see a woodland map (even tho it’s set in the desert), which would mean expanding the war beyond Iraq.</p>

<p>That makes no sense.</p>

<p>The aim turns before the vision. That’s like turning your head only only once your gun is pointing off into your peripheral vision. That &amp; it’s also easier/faster to turn your head IRL than it is an assault rifle or similar. I’d never aim somewhere before looking at it IRL, but in-game that would require more mouse movement or be a lot slower than the way it is in insurgency now.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, that’s always a plus. I hate when recoil pushes the camera around.</p>

            <p>The scope zoom looks awesome. The game looks very fun but it needs to do more to stand out of the crowd. I would love to see a woodland map (even tho it’s set in the desert), which would mean expanding the war beyond Iraq.</p>

</aside>
<p>While I can’t say I’m a big “realistic war shooter” gamer, I can say that that sort of thing DOES sort of fit. It goes in Red Orchestra, Red Orchestra 2, and Insurgency 1.</p>
<p>Realistically, your aim is not in some way glued to your eyes or head, and your gun is only vaguely going to go in the direction you want until you pull up the ironsight.</p>
<p>It doesn’t even make close-range combat impossible, it just makes “hip-firing” a bit more realistic to what it is. It also means kickback and recoil don’t have to force your view upward, just your gun.</p>

<p>James,</p>
<p>The criticism I have is that it’s just another shoot-em-up war game.<br>
There’s been plenty of those out there for years and I’m looking for something new to try. I’m sure it will have some success but, for me, I’m looking for something really creative new and exciting.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>CPU while your criticism is noted and valid as it pertains to the modern FPS market, I can assure you Insurgency is different. If I had to describe Insurgency for someone who is not familiar with it; I’d have to say its not only good, but frustratingly good. its almost as if all the good parts of CSS and ARMA 2 had a kid.There is simply nothing like it.The learning curve while brutal and demanding at first, becomes enjoyable once you realize the limitations and advantages of certain weapons in the game. Each weapon feels unique and realistic (Recoil is a BIOTCH), suppressing fire may seem like a gimmick, but its a game-play element that REALLY forces players to utilize cover and think strategically.Team work is not only encouraged, but rewarded as the game modes are almost impossible to be won by a team of lone wolves. Plus its fun as all get out.</p>
<p>Bottom line, you want a unique experience? Ins2 is the real deal and a half.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Someone who has logged an embarrassing amount of <span class="bbcode-i">days</span> playing INS</p>
