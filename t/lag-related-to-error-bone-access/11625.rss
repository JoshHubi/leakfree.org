    <title>Lag related to Error Bone Access</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lag-related-to-error-bone-access/11625</link>
    <description>Since playing the game with the console enabled I have noticed that whenever I get the error bone access come up my game starts to lag...

Is their anyway to fix the Error bone access entities as I feel this is causing problems to performance... But I could be wrong or it could be something related to this.

Either way I would like to know if this error is fixible as it seems to reference numbered entities and repaets the error of an npc until it&#39;s dead.

Alien grunts seem to carry this problem</description>
