    <title>What commercial/AAA game do you think has the most realistic gun sounds?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-commercial-aaa-game-do-you-think-has-the-most-realistic-gun-sounds/8445</link>
    <description>As the title says, what AAA games do you think have the most realistic sounds for guns?

As good as BFBC2 and BF3 guns sound, they seem to be more &quot;cinematic&quot;, at least most of the guns I&#39;ve heard fired or seen in videos don&#39;t sound like their in game variants, in fact many of them sound much more &quot;raw&quot; in RL if you get my meaning.

I think BF2 had the most realistic gun sounds. They aren&#39;t all spot on, but most of them seem pretty similar to their RL counterparts and have that &quot;raw&quot; sound to them.</description>

            <p>They did sound good but a lot of them weren’t accurate.</p>
<p>I really liked the M1 garand in CoD 1</p>

<p>CoD 1 and 2 had some of the best gun sound ever. It went downhill after the fourth.</p>

<p>Ofc you’re gonna like shit sounds if you got a shit sound system.</p>
<p>Battlefield 2 + has always had the tastiest sounds for decent cones.</p>

            <p>Realistic? Bleeeeeh.</p>
<p>My favorites have been from Call of Duty (they at least get something right) and Killing Floor. (Especially their recoil animations)</p>
<p>Least favorite are Bad Company 2’s, but they may sound better if I had some sort of bass audio system</p>

<p>totally forgot about Black was a great game, everything about it was in my opinion was polished - especially the audio.</p>

            <p>BF3 has the best sounding guns but I don’t think they’re realistic, when you hear real rifles being fired in videos they all sound the same, but all the guns in the game have gone through filters to give them more thick meaty and distinctive sounds to be more entertaining, especially the M16 and AK, they sound <span class="bbcode-i">amazing</span>.</p>

            <p>Apparently the new Medal of Honor has pretty damn realistic gun sounds, at least in the SP campaign.</p>

            <p>I would imagine, but some of the sounds seem to be paired with the wrong variants of similar guns.</p>
<p>Still all BF games sound extremely impressive, and like actual wars.</p>

            <p>To my knowledge, BF3 uses sounds recorded from the actual guns. I don’t know. They probably did the same for BF2 though.</p>
