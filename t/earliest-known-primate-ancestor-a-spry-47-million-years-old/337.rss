    <description>Norwegian scientists have found what seems to be the missing link in the human evolution. Pretty cool, I guess.

            <p>We know what happend for all those billions of years, but we do not know what happend 1 billionth of a second after the big bang, the moment our universe began to undergo the inflation (inflation theory) which caused it to increase in size by billions upon billions of times.</p>
<p>People think dark energy has something to do with it, but this energy (which makes up over 90% of our universe) is not very well known but we do know it’s there.</p>
<p>The only way the universe could have been created according to science would be either quantum fluctuations or a ‘primevil atom’ also known as a singularity (like black holes)</p>
<p>And you can’t say religion is a ‘legit’ answer on to how the universe began but yes for now all we can do really is speculate about what happend, these things are extremely complex though and I don’t know much about them, Stephen Hawking does.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Your question is irrelevant, you are asking me what was before the big bang which would suggest there was time - BUT THERE WASN’T.</p>
<p>This is the example of a question usually asked by a religious person (I do not call you one i’m not on the offensive here).</p>
<p>I don’t mind people being religious, just don’t bother me with it when I have no interest and I don’t want it to interfere with my daily life.</p>

<p>Here is a interesting Q &amp; A about the beginning of energy:<br>
I would like to ask what your theory is on the beginning of energy. Where did it come from? There is the theory of God, but are there any other legitimate theories?</p>
<p>-Emily (age 13)<br>
Southern Georgia, United States<br>
A:	 Perhaps your question is really about the beginning of there being anything at all. The beginning of " energy" itself may not be quite the issue, beause at least in some pictures of the universe (simple closed geometry) the total energy is and always was zero.<br>
Our standard pictures can trace things back from now to a tiny fraction of a second after some dramatic ’origin’ event. That may be the sort of inflationary Big Bang most often discussed or a collision between two 3-D ’branes’ in a higher dimensional space. The consequences of those pictures for our current world would be only a bit different, so sorting out which picture is better isn’t done yet.<br>
But you’re really asking about what got things started ’before’ that. We don’t know if the idea of ’before’ makes sense here, because in the mathematics describing this phase, there may be nothing like time which can be smoothly traced all the way through. Still, we can take the question as being “how does the universe fit into some bigger mathematical picture that all hangs together?” In other words, is there some big picture of spacetime in which the ’beginning’ of our universe obeys the most basic laws, instead of just coming from nowhere?<br>
We don’t know the answer to that yet, because we don’t yet know the most basic laws. String theorists and others are trying to work on those laws, but until they make more progress we won’t be able to say much about the very beginning of how our universe got started. You’re young though, so you may well live to see real progress on these questions.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, the question is meaningless because, if I understood A Brief History of Time correctly, there is no beginning or ending to time or space. Which doesn’t mean it’s infinite.<br>
Time and space are curved in such a way to make that possible (again, if I understood correctly), but don’t ask me to explain how.</p>
<p>Well, according to somewhat recent (I think) theories anyway.</p>

<p>I find comfort in my believes as well as my knowledge of natural fact. I’m not a robot and there is a lot that cannot be explained. For example, the human mind. Science can tell us so much, but can it tell us why we are moved by a piece of music? Or by a fine pint of beer? Again, we should never dismiss our beliefs, but take comfort in them.</p>
<p>Conversely, they have to be overridden by evidence to the contrary nor should you act in a violent nature toward those who will not confirm the same beliefs.</p>

<p>Not to offend you or anything, but there are certain religions who do not believe in blood transfusion or organ transplants for example, when we all know that these are procedures that save people’s lives everyday, and their benefits are 100% scientific proven.

<p>These are the people that give people like me a bad image.

<p>That’s that for now. I admit I’ve said nothing that can rationally defend my position, but it is extremely hard to since I can’t be more specific.</p>

<p>I am not going to argue in favor of dualism, no matter how many people post reductionist arguments. The fact that so many different arguments are being posted, but zero citations or links to an empirically proven scientific theory, continues to prove my point. Like Intooblivion says,</p>

<p>Since scientific theories of consciousness have yet to be empirically proven, any factual assertions of the nature of consciousness are therefore unscientific assumptions. Including dualism, including reductionism, including the existence of a “soul,” including “thoughts are electricity.”</p>

            <p>Brain activity appears, to all possible means of detection currently available, to be completely linked to ‘thought’ on a one-to-one basis. The relationship in detail is not yet understood, true. But until there is a even a single piece of evidence that thought can exist independently of brain activity, believing that it can is a large and baseless assumption, albeit not one that can be disproved. Because as I tried to say earlier, it’s impossible to prove a negative. We could study braindead coma patients for a million years and find no evidence of thought, but we still can’t say that proves there’s no thought in a braindead person because there’s no way of knowing for sure that tomorrow there won’t suddenly be some evidence in the form of a braindead person developing the ability to use poltergeist activity to write something down or whatever. That’s why the burden of proof is on the assertion that something exists or is possible, not on the alternative that it doesn’t or is impossible, because they are logically unprovable. So if dualism implies that thought is possible without brain activity, then the only logical response is to remain sceptical until some evidence is presented.</p>
<p>As for God, it’s true that there can never be such a thing as evidence that some form of undetectable, intangible, omnipotent being didn’t or doesn’t exist outside of the realms of human understanding. But as yet He hasn’t provided any decent evidence <span class="bbcode-i">for</span> his existence either, so there’s <span class="bbcode-i">exactly</span> as much evidence in support of that as there is to support that the Giant Flying Spaghetti monster created the universe, or that we all exist in some author’s mind on the <span class="bbcode-i">real</span> Earth, or that no supernatural will was involved at all in the creation of the universe but some as yet poorly understand natural process (like the ekpyrotic theory). As above, there’s no way to prove that God, the Spaghetti monster, the Author <span class="bbcode-i">don’t</span> exist, but certainly no evidence that they <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> either. Since there’s nothing to choose between any of those beliefs in terms of provability, I tend not to <span class="bbcode-i">believe</span> any of them (but certainly not in any kind of supernatural entity - I don’t see anything more reasonable in any of the Gods of the religions of the world than the Flying Spaghetti monster), but remain interested in the theories of physicists because at the very least I have more respect for the scientific method of trying to find out what’s what and prove your theory with some evidence than in simply accepting that the answer is something I’m told by what someone wrote down in a Holy book or someone who’s had some unlikely revelation.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say dualism is an assumption based on “nothing,” but I agree that it is an assumption. Materialism is also an assumption, since it has yet to be empirically proven. Which brings me full circle to my original point: arguments against religion using science as “proof,” as well as arguments against science using religion as “proof,” always rest upon assumptions which render them useless (because you end up debating the assumptions rather than the argument).</p>

<p>Strange that you say watchmaker. You weren’t alluding to the watch maker argument are you? Because it’s a load of shite.</p>
<p>How can you look down at a watch, see that it’s designed because it’s complex (even though there’s never been known that watches occur naturally without a designer) amongst nature which makes it different, and then say nature is also designed.</p>
<p>So basically it’s like saying “Oh look, a watch in a forest made of watches, lying on ground made of watches. This watch is somehow special and obviously designed, because throughout my entire life I’ve only seen watches made by people and none that grow on trees!”</p>
<p>It’s not like natural selection is random, “blind” and “unconcious”. Natural selection guides evolution to make the organism more apt for survival. I’d hardly call that blind when that’s all it’s ever done, is make organisms better.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, I was not referring to the watchmaker argument. I agree with you that the watchmaker argument is crap. I was referring to Richard Dawkin’s words about natural selection in his book “The Blind Watchmaker: Why The Evidence of Evolution Reveals A Universe Without Design”. He says that if “natural selection, the unconscious, automatic, blind, yet essentially nonrandom process Darwin discovered–has no purpose in mind. If it can be said to play the role of a watchmaker in nature, it is the blind watchmaker.” These are the words on the back of his book. Richard Dawkins (the most famous atheist of this modern era, it seems) is Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University.</p>

            <p>The thing is, it might actually lead to an extra not functional limb, if it doesn’t affect the specie’s survival.</p>
<p>If such a creature managed to reproduce and constitute a whole line of descendants, then there’s no reason for the species not to prosperate. But, you can’t call it a “successful mutation”, since it didn’t really bring any benefits to such creature as far as surviving goes, and you can’t call it an “evolutionary failure” either.</p>

            <p>Strange that you say watchmaker. You weren’t alluding to the watch maker argument are you? Because it’s a load of shite.</p>
<p>How can you look down at a watch, see that it’s designed because it’s complex (even though there’s never been known that watches occur naturally without a designer) amongst nature which makes it different, and then say nature is also designed.</p>
<p>So basically it’s like saying “Oh look, a watch in a forest made of watches, lying on ground made of watches. This watch is somehow special and obviously designed, because throughout my entire life I’ve only seen watches made by people and none that grow on trees!”</p>
<p>It’s not like natural selection is random, “blind” and “unconcious”. Natural selection guides evolution to make the organism more apt for survival. I’d hardly call that blind when that’s all it’s ever done, is make organisms better.</p>

<p>It shouldn’t have to; the origin of life was an improbable event that only needed to occur once, whereas evolution is an ongoing, cumulative selection process. It’s a bit like expecting automotive engineering to explain the invention of the wheel.</p>

<p>True. After all, natural selection as we all know is the unconscious, blind watchmaker. It has no goal and that shows us that there is no origin of life needed. After watching the video that intooblivion posted, I can see the athiest viewpoint. Religion is like the blanket that Linus in the Charlie Brown cartoons holds on to and never lets go. If we get rid of religion, we lose that attachment and we have a hard time coping with the withdrawal. While that video was enlightening, the only way I will stop believing in God completely is if I take part in a flatliner experiment and I do annihilate (cease to exist) at the time of death and someone brings me back to life with the paddles saying CLEAR. Oh and by the way, in case people didn’t know this, Charles Darwin lost his faith in God completely when his 10-year old daughter died as Charles could not believe in a  loving God anymore and decided that natural diseases killed her instead of the devil or some other spiritual/metaphysical explanation.</p>
