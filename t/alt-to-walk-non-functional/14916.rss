    <title>ALT to Walk Non-Functional</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/alt-to-walk-non-functional/14916</link>
    <description>I just restarted your excellent mod after some months off. I immediately noticed that pushing ALT didn&#39;t slow me down -- he always walks VERY fast. Pushing SHIFT increases the speed even further. I don&#39;t recall this problem from the last time I played. I found some fixes involving Autoexec.cfg and Config.cfg but they didn&#39;t seem to work for me. I also found a note from the devs in the Steam forums that a fix was in process, but that was a long time ago. I&#39;m using the Steam version and auto-update is turned on. Is there something I&#39;m missing?</description>

            <p>There is  a check box in the options for turning off always run. Try that and see if it fixes your problem.</p>
