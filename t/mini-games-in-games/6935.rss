            <p>Mini-games that are deviate from the regular gameplay mechanics are best left optional.<br>
But I’m not sure how I feel about them rewarding the player with unique items that make the game easier.<br>
They’re also best when they make sense for them to exist in-story.</p>

            <p>The DS thing was pretty fun and easy for me. In any case, if its a good minigame, it tends to work, if its not, it tends to not work. Most get repetitive fast, though, no matter how fun they were.</p>
