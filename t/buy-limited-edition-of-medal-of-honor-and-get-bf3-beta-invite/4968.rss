<p>well… I wont buy any of it. According to the comments EA DICE is a shit developer and Battlefield 3 will be just as bad as Bad Company 2. I do play Bad Company 2 but that game had its fair share of problems. Just like Battlefield 2 had. It did require a lot of patches before it became playable.</p>
<p>Does anyone bother to test their games properly before release anymore?</p>

</aside>
<p>BFBC2 is the single most enjoyable online game ever to come into the gaming world (except the MoH beta, because that’s damn fun as well). It’s already been patched enough and it’s playable.</p>
<p>Bitches need slapping.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say that. I always thought PC gaming was a bunch of bullshit. Then I got steam, and I realized just how much better certain games were on the PC than on console. Half-life series, TF2, etc. are usually better to play on the PC.  But that doesn’t mean I no longer love console gaming.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure Medal of Honor’s multiplayer is the most basic a shooter can get. You select one of 3-4 classes that gives you a rifle, a pistol, and grenades. Your objective is to capture a point by standing there. You go out and get maybe 1-2 kills, then get killed. You respawn in the action and repeat.</p>
<p>I just don’t see many elements of strategy, uniqueness, or even fun. Just a big showoff of graphics and effects and “realism”.</p>
