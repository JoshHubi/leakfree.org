    <title>Major frame drop/stutter issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/major-frame-drop-stutter-issues/9655</link>
    <description>certain places experiencing stuttering and huge drop in frame rate 

noticed in task manager seems to be a CPU issue 
i noticed multi-core rendering option cant be changed but i tried changed threw dev console but didn&#39;t seem to help (not sure if this method actually enabled or not)

CPU 980x@4.6ghz
Video 2 480SLI
120hz monitor

Max settings
frame capped at 120 dip to low 60
without frame cap goes up to 300 fps and drops to low 60

things i tried
disabled hyper threading
set hl2.exe process priory to high
messed with CPU affinity
set pre rendered frame to 1
different video drivers
disabled SLI 

nothing is working
