<p>Did anyone else <span class="bbcode-i">smell</span> the irony of his ignorant dismissal of mods whilst he displayed the Counter Strike box art in the background?</p>

</aside>
<p>I smelled the irony when he showed the Civilization for Windows when he said you had to have an old OS to run games like that… it runs on Vista flawlessly.</p>
<p>He also swears too much which indicates that he cannot put forth a good argument… which he didn’t.</p>

<p>Yep. Unlimited backwards compatibility, unlimited future proofing to some extent, and no one has to “authorize,” which games you can or can’t play. And, in the long run, its a hell of a lot cheaper.</p>

            <p>Look at it from a platform perspective…</p>
<p>Consoles come and go, after a few years they are replaced by the next generation of consoles and as soon as that happens they are essentially obsolete. Games are no longer produced for them and their products are no longer supported.</p>
<p>If you’re a console gamer that pretty much means you are buying a new platform at the whim of the industry, and when you’re buying a console… you’re paying out a fortune on merit alone. I’m sure a lot of people who bought the PS3 did so on the basis of the success of the Playstation and Playstation 2, and I’m certain although a lot of those people would refuse to admit it, if they knew what the PS3 was really going to be like (major emphasis on processing power and major lack of game titles) they probably would have opted for an Xbox 360 instead.</p>
<p>The PC is a continuous platform with no limitations, you can upgrade it if you choose to, but you don’t have to. You don’t have to own the latest hardware or the latest games. Hell, you can play DOS games from 25 years ago if you want to. You can even use emulation software to run console games. It’s true, get a PS1 emulator and go put an old PS1 game in your CD drive and play it on your PC.</p>
<p>It’s a multi-purpose platform that isn’t strictly for gaming. By its very definition it is better than any console in every way possible. It’s your platform, you can use it for what you want, you can make it as powerful as you want. It’s not a standardised set of hardwear in a curvy plastic case, set to become obsolete in less than five years.</p>
<p>And if you’re still not convinced… Consider this: You can’t watch free porn on consoles.</p>

<p>Halo isn’t marketed to families that eat rice cakes and play with motion-controlled dildos. The majority of Halo’s audience is “real” gamers just like you and me.<br>
Whether or not you personally like it has no effect on the fact above.</p>

            <p>While the point stands that we (referring to PC gamers) shouldn’t care and accept that he is entitled to his opinion, that point ends when his views begin to threaten our gaming experience. Console ports are becoming more frequent and much worse because ignorant dickweeds like him encourage the mass production of sub par, clunky, repetitive, and regressive games. The days of games actually going somewhere have ended, we’re stuck in a rut of sequels due to the constant support of casual gamers.</p>

<p>A few button placements and thumbstick sensitivity. That’s all a controller really needs.<br>
I find it funny how you didn’t use how most console FPS games use Auto-Aim as a bitching point. If you did, I would reply that all it does is <span class="bbcode-i">slightly</span> guide your reticule to an enemy, but only if you’re already aiming at the target and you can easily fuck it up by moving the joystick somewhere else.</p>

<p>Also, why do you have to be “super serious” in order to be a “real” gamer? It’s a game. I laugh at people that are “super serious” about A VIDEO GAME. I play games for fun experiences, and I can do that across all platforms.</p>

</aside>
<p>What I’m trying to say is on a console, you have a game that is much more likely to work but is crippled in abilities. You can’t mod. You can’t customize your controls as much and you can’t use things like joy sticks, steering wheels, or even, wii controllers and xbox controllers.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean serious as in carrying a lot about losing and winning, I mean serious as in wanting to get as much as is physically possible out of your gaming experience.</p>
<p>After saying that, yes I’m a fanboy and my opinions are extremely biased but I can’t really help that. That said, I quite enjoy playing Halo3 with my xbox fanboy friends.</p>
<p>If you want a social and easier (in user friendliness) and more casual experience, you’re better off with a console. If you want to have as much customization and choices as possible at the sacrifice of some stability, get a pc.</p>
<p>And I hope me being a pc fanboy/pirater won’t make you too pissed off at me.</p>

<p>Oh he’s going to have fun with that first paragraph :fffuuu:</p>
<p>Sure console gaming may require more brains but for some gamers they don’t have the option of getting a PC. Even though a PC may give a more satisfying experience using a console doesn’t make you any less of a gamer, it just means you don’t have the option of getting deeper into the game.</p>
