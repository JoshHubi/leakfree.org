    <description>I know that I don&#39;t post here enough(those who know me)/You probably don&#39;t know who I am(those who don&#39;t) but I just had to post this. After giving up on the Meat Circus the first time I got to it, and giving up on it a second time a few months later, now, probably more than a year since I last played it, I have finally beaten Psychonauts! I can say, without a doubt, that this is the best game I&#39;ve played. Everyone should play it, it&#39;s on Steam so there&#39;s no reason not to!</description>

            <p>Wolfer… Didn’t you used to be one of the Dev’s?</p>
<p>And Psychonauts= Pure Awesome.</p>
<p>that meat level was difficult, and scary aswell… Those gory rabbit creatures really changed the tone of the game. But nevertheless, still a bloody brilliant game. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I don’t remember Wolfer, but I will give props for beating Psychonauts finally. The Meat Circus kicked my ass so hard I can still feel the bruises, but I’m going to chalk a lot of that up to lack of sleep, as I was playing it well through night and almost into the morning before finally calling it quits, and I’m pretty sure I smashed through it readily once I got some sleep.</p>
<p>I’m actually picking it back up to play through again once I finish off my current run of goldsource and source mods.</p>
