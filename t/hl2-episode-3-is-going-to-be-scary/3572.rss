    <title>HL2: Episode 3 is going to be scary</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-episode-3-is-going-to-be-scary/3572</link>
    <description>&quot;according to CVG, Valve boss Gabe Newell said, &quot;I feel like we&#39;ve gotten away from genuinely scaring the player more than I&#39;d like, and it&#39;s something we need to think about, in addition to broadening the emotional palette we can draw on.&quot;&quot;

I know I&#39;m pretty excited, because I&#39;m pretty sure when Gabe said scary I think he meant the ambiance of the game is going to have that BM feel to it  :smiley:</description>

<p>Could be that she’s just sort of broken and disspirited after Eli’s death. I have a feeling that at least for a good chunk of Episode 3 Alyx is going to be a lot less upbeat than usual.</p>

            <p>in terms of the broadening of the emotional pallet, someone on the <a href="http://HL2.net" rel="nofollow noopener">HL2.net</a> forums had the idea that Alyx is pregnant and Gordon’s the dad. lol.</p>
<p>she develops a nesting obsession and obsessively cleans white forest, or gets a craving for roasted headcrab and tries to trap and kill Lamarr.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Well the Half Life series has taking a more fatal turn, and I personally found Ravenholm to be quite scary at times. I was always looking for when the next zombie would come out, and then I would get lost and without a sawblade…</p>

            <p>Although it is as equally likely to be a dark twist on portal, or a new IP.  They’ll have to come up with something a bit different in the story line regarding alyx to really impress.  Killing her, or having her have a happy relationship with Gordon, both are waaaay too cliche to stand out from the crowd.  And Valve do tend to stand out from the crowd…</p>

            <p>Actually, I think there are big things in store for Alyx in Episode 3.  G-man is protecting her for some reason.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="G-man">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 G-man:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>When I plucked her from Black Mesa, I acted in the face of objections that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone. I have learned to ignore such nay-sayers when quelling them … was out of the question. Still, I am not one to squander my investments, and I remain confident she was worth far more than the initial appraisal. That’s why I must now … extract from you some small repayment owed for your own survival. See her safely to White Forest, Dr. Freeman.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t believe that the simple relaying of a message is all the G-man wants out of Alyx.</p>

            <p>Does anybody else think that this might be a hint that Alyx is going to get killed off? The emotional significance of Alyx to most HL2 players is well-known, and with the explosion at the end of HL2 it seemed that Alyx was killed by the reactor exploding, only for her to be saved and then nearly killed <em>again</em> by the Hunter, and then Eli is killed at the end of the game. This suggests to me that Valve are not scared of killing Alyx off, and maybe this will be some way of concluding the Half-Life 2 story arc. (Personally, I’m betting on Alyx sacrificing herself to close some sort of Combine portal, but that’s pure guessing)</p>

<p>Hmm, I read that too. I’m not sure what the first one means, but it might be a hint at more character death, likely those of Mossman and/or Alyx. Maybe, maybe not. The second gives me two seperate impressions; either that the player’s ingame abilities will become slightly, <span class="bbcode-i">subtly</span> worsened over the course of time, thus lending to the impression that their abilities truly are fading away. (A very slight, gradual decrease in running speed, or the gravity gun not punting things as far as it used to, for example.) Of course, Valve might just more likely just give an atmosphere that gives you the feeling that this is Gordon Freeman’s last stand; that you won’t be walking away from this one alive.</p>

            <p>I read that Gabe said the worst fears of his core fans were “The death of their children. The fading of their own abilities.” Now that’s a little creepy, ain’t it?</p>

<p>By the sound of it, it seems like they’re aiming more for the pervading atmosphere rather than quick ‘jump’ moments throughout the game. As in, more Silent Hill than Resident Evil</p>

            <p>Well, I’m up for scaryness, HL2 in Revenholm was possibly the first ‘Scary’ thing I played, now it’s a walk in the park, so I hope EP3 has some more intense moments.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, A bit that did make me jump was that Hunter’s appearance before it attacks Alyx.</p>
