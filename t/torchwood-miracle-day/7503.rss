So far it’s good, but I’m pretty sure that they’ve gotten a push to blow more things up.<br>
That’s really all I can say…</p>

            <p>I’ve watched both episodes so far.  Even the dude that got blown up didn’t compare to the shock value of Jack getting blown up and regenerating IMO.</p>
<p>TGP, yes it is a Doctor Who spinoff.  Jack got his immortality in the end of the first season.</p>

<p>Uh? It’s not an American version. It’s the same central cast (with a few more for this season) with the same production crew as every other season. It’s just set (and only for a few episodes) in America because of where the funding for the season came form.</p>

            <p>I never watched the previous seasons. I never knew there were previous seasons until after I watched it. I only watched it because I thought the black guy was Chiwetel Ejifor (it’s not). I was upset when I realized that it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Is this a Doctor Who spinoff? I don’t think I care anymore.</p>
