    <title>Chapter Unlocking system &amp; 3D Backgrounds Don&#39;t Work Properly After Installing Maps</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/chapter-unlocking-system-3d-backgrounds-dont-work-properly-after-installing-maps/13608</link>
    <description>well, i installed BM:UPLINK &amp; the XEN mod, went in face poser -&gt; file -&gt; rebuild scenes.image... and the two mods work fine, i even found a version of the last LC map that goes to the first XEN map (so i got the two maps, and, i haven&#39;t tested it, but i should get a smooth transition between the two chapters)... though here&#39;s my problem...

BM seams to be coded in such a way so that the chapter unlocking system only works with the main chapters that BM comes with... if i beat uplink, sometimes it unlocks all chapters besides the XEN ones, other times it doesn&#39;t unlock anything at all (uplink is viewed as chapter 0), a quick fix for this would be to go in autoexec.cfg, make a new line and go like -&gt; sv_unlockedchapters 20, though i wander if it&#39;s possible to make the chapter system work as it does in vanilla (the xen chapters are viewed as 15, 16, 17, 18 &amp; the credits chapter is 19)...

Another problem i have is that, uplink is chapter 0, though if i go to INBOUND, i get the 3D background from Anomalous Materials,if i go to Anomalous Materials, i get the background from Unforeseen Consequences, and so on... as a quick fix i can use this

though i&#39;d like to keep my 3D backgrounds in there (to bad uplink &amp; the xen mod don&#39;t have 3D backgrounds)...

Any thoughts or fixes for all of this ?

Thanks  :smiley:</description>
