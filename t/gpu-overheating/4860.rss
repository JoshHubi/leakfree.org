    <title>GPU Overheating?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gpu-overheating/4860</link>
    <description>I have an Nvidia GeForce 8500 GT and although i haven&#39;t noticed any problems recently a couple programs I&#39;ve downloaded register that it&#39;s overheating.

I don&#39;t even know what a GPU is supposed to run at but mine is hovering at ~55C (~140F) (no programs running) and apparently both of the programs think its fan is busted but its running just fine.

So I have a few questions:
Is its temperature way to high?
Should i just buy a new card? (I was thinking of doing this anyway but...)
Any easy way to fix something like this?</description>

            <p>Nothing wrong with that temperature at all, mine idles at 40-45 C and goes up to 65-70 C load.</p>
<p>It’s normal, try to keep it below 105 C (GPU can handle higher tempertures but surrounding stuff like capacitors cant)<br>
Even the newer videocards easily get 90 C under load.</p>
