    <title>The huge radiation spillage during intro sequence - Immersion breaking</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-huge-radiation-spillage-during-intro-sequence-immersion-breaking/13809</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m having the following problem with the intro tram sequence:

&quot;I&quot;, Gordon Freeman, witness a huge radioactive spillage, and see 2 scientists desperately trying to contain it / escape.

Yet when I exit the tram, I DON&#39;T TELL ANYONE that 200 meters from them, there&#39;s a life-threatening situation.

This is seriously immersion breaking, because by not having the option to tell anyone, by &quot;casually&quot; going to work, I&#39;m acting like the worst kind of scientist: I certainly must know that those 2 guys are in danger, there&#39;s just no way to either miss the scene, or not understand it.

=======

Could anything be done about this? I understand it must have taken a long time to build and choreograph the sequence, but it just doesn&#39;t work.

I could imagine a tiny leak dripping from the top of the big cylindrical thing, without any witnesses, as a sort of foreshadowing that not everything is done according to safety regulations (which is further reinforced by the forgotten Tram maintenance manual), to work, but this particular scene is just too drastic and breaks immersion. My Gordon would NEVER &quot;not tell&quot; anyone.</description>

            <p>tbh that bit did seem pretty out of place. Seeing the scientist slamming on the door, looking like he’s basically fighting for his life right at the beginning is a pretty jarring. It would fit perfectly <span class="bbcode-i">after</span> the resonance cascade starts, but sticking something that morbid in when everything’s basically supposed to be fine doesn’t really fit. If you made it like, guys in hazmat suits working to contain the mess rather than random scientists getting radiation poisoning, it would give the vibe of “Black Mesa is dangerous work” rather than “Black Mesa is a deathtrap”, because Black Mesa isn’t supposed to be a deathtrap yet. I get that it was in HL1, but the point of BM is to tweak the stuff in HL1 that doesn’t work that well, so it’s not really out of the question that something like this would be changed. My two cents anyway.</p>

            <p>What you see is a scientist working the control panel for that area while alarms are blaring and a robot is moving in to deal with it.  This means that those who can do something about it already are doing something about it.  You job is to get the frack out of the way.</p>

That you are being told to report any leaks, and yet here you are now exposed as well as several of your colleagues.
