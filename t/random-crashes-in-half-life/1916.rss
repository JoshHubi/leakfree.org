    <title>Random crashes in Half-Life :(</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/random-crashes-in-half-life/1916</link>
    <description>In all my Half-Life engine games, there is a very annoying glitch where sometimes while loading the next map, without rhyme or reason, the game will completely lock up. What was displayed on the screen when it crashed stays up on the screen no matter what I do, and requires me to restart my computer to get anything working again.
This has happened in all my GoldSource games since I first installed them, but recently it&#39;s gotten worse, and happens almost once a chapter.

Does anyone have any idea what might cause this? Please? :&#39;(</description>

            <p>The crowbar fix is the only one I ever found. On the bright side, if you ever replay the game this seems to make the game work for all following play-throughs…</p>

            <p>Thanks, Ram. I’ll try that from now on.</p>
<p>In answer to baconeggs, I have no problems with multiplayer games, i.e Counter-Strike 1.6, Half-Life Deathmatch, Op4s Multiplayer, but recently I’ve been having the same trouble in my singleplayer Source games as well.<br>
Ah well, soon I’ll be buying a new computer anyway.</p>

            <p>This is happening to me too. Even when I select Load game from the main menu of any of the Half Life games. HL1, Blue Shift, Opposing Force… It’s just doesn’t load.</p>

            <p>I get this sometimes too, a very simple solution is to predict the next loading area, equip the crowbar, and proceed slowly until it loads. It seems to work okay.</p>

            <p>Ok, it’s not your system then. I have seen something like this happen with the Natural Selection mod, which is also GldSrc but is purely multiplayer. Usually the issue isn’t very common and a restart will fix it. Maybe it is different in multiplayer, perhaps you should try that and see if the error persists.</p>

            <p>My computer is pretty awful, but has no problems running GoldSRC games other than this particular issue… I think. They run at a reasonably smooth (but still low) 50 fps on highest resolution and graphics.</p>
<p>Specs: Pentium 4 Single Core, 3.0GHz.<br>
512MB RAM<br>
A horrible integrated Intel graphics chip, 64MB of video memory. Specifically, it’s<br>
an 82865G Graphics Controller.</p>
