    <title>[Suggestion] Difficulty-based Ammo Pick-ups?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestion-difficulty-based-ammo-pick-ups/14011</link>
    <description>In Half-Life 2, the amount of ammo that the player picks up from ammo items is factored by what difficulty to which the game is set.  In the console (and in skill.cfg), the player could modify the values [b]sk_ammo_qty_scale1[/b], [b]sk_ammo_qty_scale2[/b], and [b]sk_ammo_qty_scale3[/b] to change the ammo pick-up factor for each difficulty.

Could this difficulty-based ammo factoring be added into Black Mesa?

Currently, ammo pickups in Black Mesa aren&#39;t affected by game difficulty.  And with the removal of the sk_ammo_(gun name here) commands that the mod had, there&#39;s seemingly no way to change how much ammo the player picks up--whether it&#39;s for difficulty or any other reason--at all.

If you don&#39;t bring difficulty factoring to ammo, can you please at least bring back the sk_ammo commands for the individual ammo types?

Thank you.</description>

            <p>I tried several different combinations with and without quotes like sk_item_ammo_357_pickup, sk_item “ammo_357” pickup, etc and couldn’t find anything that worked. I’m looking through all cvars letter by letter ingame(cvarlist op) now to be sure.</p>

            <p>I attempted those ammo commands earlier. The game doesn’t recognize them.</p>
<p>Edit: Come to think of it, it may be more reasonable to believe that those inoperable commands are glitched.  It’s unusual that there are supposed to be double quotes within the commands themselves, and it’s unsurprising that they aren’t working as a result.</p>

            <p>Took me a couple minutes to re-find them but the cvars for changing how much ammo a pickup gives still exist, albeit with a changed command.</p>
<p>sk_item_"ammo_357"“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"ammo_crossbow”“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"ammo_energy”“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"ammo_glock”“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"ammo_mp5"“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"ammo_shotgun”“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"ammo_snark”“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"grenade_frag”“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"grenade_mp5"“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"grenade_rpg”“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"grenade_satchel”“<em>pickup"<br>
sk_item</em>"grenade_tripmine””_pickup”</p>
<p>sk_item_battery_value<br>
sk_item_healthkit_value<br>
sk_item_healthvial_value<br>
^ these 3 are in skill.cfg but figured i’d throw them in since it’s related.</p>
<p>Didn’t test them yet but somehow I really doubt they don’t work.</p>
<p>edit: just tested ingame, “unknown command: sk_item_” …<br>
No idea how to change it now, i’ll look in the game files and scripts with gcfscape since I have nothing better to do.</p>
