    <title>Stuck in a door [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stuck-in-a-door-fixed/10610</link>
    <description>Hello!

I&#39;m at the beginning of the game. I took the hazard suit and headed down an elevator. However, as the elevator was going doing, I decided to just go ahead and and drop down the the next floor instead. However, the door was looked, so I waited.

When the elevator caught up, there was a loading screen. After that, the doors opened. However, only one side (the one opposite of me) of the door opened. The side where I am didn&#39;t open. Probably because I&#39;m blocking it. However, it is also blocking me. So I&#39;m stuck. Getting crushed. and gonna have to restart.
