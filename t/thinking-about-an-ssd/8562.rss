    <title>Thinking About an SSD</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/thinking-about-an-ssd/8562</link>
    <description>I think a few people on here use SSDs and I&#39;m thinking of getting one to install the OS and a few programs on and maybe install a Linux distribution onto it as well. How large of one should I get? They&#39;re pretty pricy and I really have no idea how much space the stuff I want to do would take up. 

So what do you guys do, as in how do you have your SSD set up?</description>

            <p>I was actually going to get another HDD but want to wait until the prices go down. I have $200 that’s burning a hole in my pocket, but I’m not sure if I want to get one for around that price, or like you say, a smaller one. Decisions decisions.</p>

<p>I do not have an SSD.  But, they are very useful if you know how to use them.  I would install the basic programs on them such as Windows, Web browser, media players, etc.  But other programs you wouldn’t use everyday, such as games, use and HDD.  And I mean the games themselves, Steam would probably be fine.  Just not the games themselves.  They really will help your speeds but be careful to not save too many things to your desktop or other common places.  As you said, they’re pricey and have little space as well so don’t waste TOO much money on it.  That money could be spent on a bigger HDD or other components in your PC.  I’d say anywhere from around 30gb-50gb should be enough.</p>

            <p>I got myself a pretty high end PC a few monthes ago, I took a Crossfire of 6950hd’s but still I wondered about the SSD.<br>
After reading multiple articles &amp; asking a few friends, I ended up buying a Vertex 3 of 120Go. My friends were all like :" not worth the money blabla"</p>
<p>Well its absolutly worth your money. My computer boots under 30 seconds with full windows loaded and ready to launch new programs, Even with the heavy-ass Kaspersky antivirus I have, game loading times are only a few seconds if none, you will always be first in any Multiplayer game to have loaded the games and everything generally is faster.</p>
<p>The only thing you have to consider is that 120Go is really not much, but going for more will rip your wallet. With windows and 2 or 3 big games your are pretty much full.</p>

            <p>I could have sworn I read something about a program that lets you install a few games in one place while the others are in another place. I suppose it doesn’t matter since BF3 is probably the only game I’ll do this with and I forgot that it uses Origin  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  .</p>

<p>Install your most used things like your web browser, music player, etc on it.  I have one game on my SSD right now, and it does make a difference over having it on a regular HDD.</p>
<p>What I was saying about Steam earlier is, it relies on the steamapps folder within the Steam folder.  I’m sure you either would want more installed than your SSD would be able to handle, or you would want a huge SSD.  <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148527" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Huge SSDs are pretty costly.</a>  That link is to the cheapest 512 GB that Newegg has.  You can get a 1TB hybrid for about half the price, but that’s part flash memory, and part spinning disc.</p>

            <p>Depends on the size. I bought a 120gb SSD with the intent to install work/designer programs on it too, I still install games on my HDD but visual studio, photoshop etc all go to SSD.</p>
<p>However, you should consider wear leveling, which in short: the more free space you have, the longer the life expectancy of your SSD will be.</p>

            <p>If I do what some are suggesting here and just put windows and what starts up with windows onto the SSD, would anything really load any quicker? I don’t turn my computer off that often so the load time doesn’t bother me. So if I have say FF on my normal HDD, but windows is on my SSD, would that have any affect on how FF runs?</p>

            <p>It’s totally worth it for the price, once you’ve used one for a while you’ll never look back. Windows boots up in under 40 seconds for me, and programs I use a lot open in a flash. Everything else just feels faster and much more responsive than a regular HDD, just the whole experience of using my computer feels different now.</p>

            <p>I would recommend just installing Steam on your second HDD.  Just so you don’t have to worry about symlinks and whatever else for your steamapps folder.  That’s what I do, and I’m satisfied enough.</p>
<p>Make sure you move your paging file to your secondary HDD as well.</p>

            <p>I don’t think I have enough PCI slots. One of my PCIe slots is taken up by my graphics card, and it covers the other one. And then I have a sound card and network card in the 2 PCI slots I have.</p>
<p>SATA 2 supports up to 3GB/s, and most of the SSDs I’ve seen max out at around 500MB/s, so if I’m not misunderstanding something there should be no problem.</p>

            <p>yeah also you could get a PCI-e x1 sata 3 card if there is any bottleneck in sata speed</p>

            <p>Windows 7 + updates should take no more than a dozen gigs. Steam… I dunno something tells me that a super high density SSD will be dead in a couple of years of steam updates and updates to their games.</p>
<p>I would recommend a small one with the highest possible overwrite rate, just for windows and every program that loads automatically after windows starts.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty much planning to install Windows and whatever programs I use right now (FF, Steam, Foobar, etc), a few games (BF3 mainly, to make it load faster), and perhaps a Linux distribution on a separate part of it. I was looking some up and 256 GBs should be enough right? Everything else, the rest of my Steam games, pictures, videos, and music will be on the 1TB drive that I have now.</p>

            <p>I’ve got a 64gb vertex ssd for my OS… but it’s getting a bit small with all the updates so go for at least a 128gb one.</p>
