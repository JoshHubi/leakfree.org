    <title>Crashes in Nvidia Surround during Aprehension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crashes-in-nvidia-surround-during-aprehension/14014</link>
    <description>I keep trying to attach the dmp files but it says that the file extension is invalid.

Anyways, I am having trouble with the transition between On a Rail and Apprehension.  When I am playing in Nvidia surround at 7680x1440 and I hit the loading section between the two while on the Freight Transit, the game crashes.  This does not happen if I just continue on foot, even in 3 screen mode.  If I let it load Apprehension, then return back to the Freight Transit, it looks like the screenshot taken here:
![2015-05-13_00001.jpg|690x500](upload://687LDUstQKB59QaTUcgmg7HjOXb.jpeg)
Headlights and screen floating, but I cannot physically jump on any cart.

If I load the game in 2560x1440, I can get on the Freight Transit just fine and make the transition without issue.  However, the game crashes during Apprehension (only while the Freight Transit is with me) if I try to switch the game back to 7680x1440.

I have been loving the game in 3 screen  mode up to this point!


Specs:
CPU: Intel i7 3930k @ 4.37GHz
GPU: EVGA GTX Titan
PhysX GPU: EVGA GTX 580 SC
Ram:  G-SKILL Ripjaw Z 16GB (4x4GB) DDR3 2133

EDIT:
So I kept going with the story, [spoiler]crashed the Freight Transit cart into the door[/spoiler] then saved it, and now it is allowing me to load and run the game in 3 screen mode.</description>

<p>HAHA yeah Black Mesa is awesome on my rig!   Never seen it below 120fps at 7680x1440.</p>
<p>Back to the bug, I kept testing around and it seems to only be crashing when that particular cart is present during the Apprehension section while I use 3 monitors.  I hope I have helped!   :thumbup:</p>
