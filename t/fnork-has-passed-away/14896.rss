    <title>Fnork has passed away</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fnork-has-passed-away/14896</link>
    <description>I hate to be the bearer of terrible news but Fnork&#39;s brother managed to contact me on Steam to inform me that Fnork has passed away since last monday. He did not share the cause of her death but I think we can deduce it was probably self-inflicted.

I don&#39;t know what else to say really. Her last post here left us worried and unfortunately our worst assumptions were met.

Her real name was Erin Caroline Grey and she was 21 year old.

Rest in Peace Fnork

            <p>Well, this wasn’t the best news to come back to.  RIP, she was a great person and I’m glad to have known her while I was a more active member of the community.  I wasn’t aware she was having rough times, but she will certainly be missed.</p>

            <p>I truly don’t really have words. I’ve been a member of these forums since I was a young teenager, and even though I don’t really visit often anymore I do remember Fnork vividly. She was a truly good person with a great sense of humor, and it was always great to see her forum posts and her in BM Steam chat. She’ll be missed dearly.</p>

<p>Hello all.</p>
<p>None of you know me, and I don’t know you. The only thing connecting us is that we knew Erin, or Fnork as you knew her. I created this account solely to post a memorial post to Erin’s profile, and I know little to nothing about Black Mesa. However, it’s been incredible seeing the outpouring of love for Erin in this thread, and so I thought I might add to it. Consider this my eulogy and tribute to a dear friend I will miss greatly. (Should this happen to seem inappropriate, since I’m not ‘one of you’, I apologise. I’m not sure how things work here.)</p>
<p>I met Erin in 2010, when we both started attending the same drama class. It was six years ago now, but it feels like a lot longer. Erin fit in perfectly with our group of drama misfits. She loved strange hats (which is something I’ve seen some of you say in your memorial posts)! We’d often have in-depth conversations about everything and nothing, often in English. Her English was masterful and she could speak it fluently with three or four different accents. Her Scottish accent was particularly good. She was also a talented actress who knew both how to be over-the-top comedic and understatedly dramatic. She’s the only actress who’s ever made me cry through the sheer emotional force of her performance.</p>
<p>Erin was also capital-H Hilarious. One of my favourite memories of her is when a few of us drama people were hanging out and decided to ~ironically watch a My Little Pony movie. It was Erin’s idea to mute the film and dub it ourselves. She had us all in stitches and I had to get her to pause the movie so that I could breathe again. Erin was also, as some of you seem to have known, a talented film-maker who made both short funny flash videos and longer short films she would often star in herself.</p>
<p>She will be missed by a great deal of people. Many hugs and thoughts to her family.</p>

<p>Thank you so very much for sharing that with us. It was very touching &lt;3</p>

<p>I was sad to hear what happened. From what I understand this girl was Swedish and I live in Sweden.</p>
<p>I want to give the family my condolences too even if I never had a chance to know Fnork.</p>

            <p>Erin had a golden sense of humor and the most interesting fashion sense. It’s so true that she made this place better with every post, and better with every random picture she shared. The world is full of moulds that it tries to turn people into, but she would always refuse to conform. She had always remained unique.</p>
<p>And I feel that quite a few people were always happy to learn more about her as time went on. We all felt that the future was full of good possibilities, especially after her recent graduation.</p>
<p>We all wish we had a greater chance to help…  I wish I knew how she was feeling. I wish I knew about her thoughts and her goals so we knew how to carry on. At the end of the day, it’s up to us to carry the torch, so to speak.</p>
<p>I’ve removed the color from my avatar as a sign of mourning.</p>

            <p>This left me truly speechless for a couple of days… This is so sad to see our worst expectations become true. I haven’t known her very well, I only posted here since a few years and then quite rarely compared to others. But, she really wasn’t anybody to be overseen, and I mean it in the best of ways. I quietly admired her open weirdness and queerness, her open mind, and her not having respect for anything or anybody.</p>
<p>Condolences to her brother and all of her family and her friends.</p>

            <p>Yes, sincere condolences from us on the team. I was keeping up with the thread and it was quite touching to see so many forum-goers be genuinly concerned for the well being of another human that they’d never even met. Says a lot about her.</p>
<p>All the best to her family and to everyone who cared about her. Truly sad.</p>

            <p>I know I speak for the entire BM team in sending sincere condolences to the family of Erin, I’m certain more of the team will leave messages.</p>
<p>A very sad loss, under any circumstance.</p>

            <p>She really will be missed.</p>
<p>I, like others,  visit these forums a lot and whenever I saw FNORK had posted something I always went to check it out because I liked the way she had of looking at things. The image I’ll personally never forget is the one she posted of her graduation. She looked so happy and it was nice to see the eagerness of her and her friends as they were taking their first steps into adulthood. I’m sorry it had to end for her and her family so abruptly.</p>
<p>You will be missed little girl.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Edited because I wanted to add my location so the family knows how far her reach extended and was felt.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>This is Fnorks brother Malte. I cannot really bear writing anything length here right now, but I’d like to thank you all for your support and thoughts. I know this community was important to my sister, but really no more than that, so I decided to bring the information to someone active here so that it was passed on in a proper manner.</p>
<p>We - my parents and I - are of course grief-stricken and to some extent still in a state of shock. It’s hard for me to really participate here right now, apart from again expressing my heartfelt thanks for all your kind words.</p>
<p>We are in the process making arrangements and I will be (very sporadically) monitoring this and other threads on the forum, providing information to you when appropriate and relaying your words to the rest of the family.</p>
<p>I’d like to note I will not be answering any direct questions at the moment, nor can I inform you properly about the cause of death as it is still under formal investigation (beside the fact it is hard just thinking about). But you should know that Fnork’s family, through me, are reading what you are writing.</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Words are gone. No amount of text can express the grief I feel for you and your family. Erin brought so much joy and love to this community. It is such a tragedy that has happened after years of being here, that I have seen nothing like the gathering of people to come together to witness the death, but celebration of a life. We truly wish your family well being, and we will always be in remembrance of her. Thank you for coming to us to give any information.</p>

            <p>After a week of assuming this was the case, I thought I’d be over it, but this just re-opens the wound.<br>
My deepest condolences to the family.</p>
<p>If I’m being honest, I didn’t personally know Fnork all that well, other than being one of the familiar faces in the ladies club subforum, but that doesn’t really matter, because she was one of those people you didn’t <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to know well in order to really like.<br>
Her posts were always fun to read, and she was always part of the conversation, and just knowing that she <span class="bbcode-b">might</span> be gone earlier this week was enough to make me lose sleep due to bad dreams. I couldn’t tell you more than a few actual facts about her, but I feel like I’ve lost a friend I’ve known for years. Which, when you really get down to it, I have.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Erin</span><span class="bbcode-b">, we never met in real life. We never really talked directly to each other. But you were an important part of this community, and it hurts like hell knowing you’re gone. Rest in peace, and know we love you. &lt;3</span></p>

<p>I’m deeply sorry for your and your family’s loss. I write this with a lump in my throat as I’ve gone through the same and this is dredging up some bad memories… I lost two very important people in my life to suicide.</p>
<p>Her loss is a pretty heavy blow to everyone here, she was enjoyable to be around despite me barely interacting with her outside of the chat thread.  I wish more could have been done to help her.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
