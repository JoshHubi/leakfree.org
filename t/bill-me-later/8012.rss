    <description>I&#39;m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I don&#39;t know where else to turn.

I have a quick question about the Bill Me Later program on various shopping websites.... And that is: If you buy something when it&#39;s on sale and choose the Bill Me Later option, do you have to pay full price &quot;later&quot; or the sale price &quot;later&quot;? I ask because of this: [url]https://www.walmart.com/ip/iBuypower-811121015343/15746845?findingMethod=Recommendation:wm:RecentlyViewedItems[/url]. If this isn&#39;t the right place to ask, then I apologize sincerely. If this is, then please help as I am a noobasaurus and have no means of finding out on my own.</description>

            <p>that how most companies do the no interest thing. (home depot, gardner white for example) If you miss a payment or exceed the time period you pay all the interest that you would have paid if the no interest deal did not exist. (interest  on the whole value not remaining balance)</p>
<p>Also the bill me later option (if you are talking about <span class="bbcode-i">Bill Me Later®</span>) is thru Paypal so the terms and conditions should be the same for every site.</p>

            <p>That sort of plan is the same way I got my Alienware years ago (poor student  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> )</p>
<p>Basically, it seems you pay a deposit then you have up to 6 months to pay the price in full (either in installments or the full amount).</p>
<p>If paid before 6 months no interest is added. Any amount outstanding after 6 months has interest added (it seems their wording may imply that interest is compounded from the date of purchase? So if you pay nothing for 6 months, you pay interest from the date of purchase, not from the end of the 6 months?)</p>
<p>Very confusing.</p>
<p>In their words:<br>
Make no payments for 6 months. You will receive monthly statements and can make payments at any time. As long as you pay in full by the promotion expiration date, you will not be billed Interest. If you do not pay in full, Interest will be billed from the date of purchase.</p>

            <p>Really depends on the T&amp;C on each specific site, you´d be better off droping them an email about it : )</p>

            <p>I would guess sale price + interest, unless they say no interest if you pay it off within a certain time frame.  And even then, they might have a bill me later fee.</p>

            <p>I would guess that you pay the sale price, but I suspect the correct answer would be “it depends on what site you buy from”.</p>
