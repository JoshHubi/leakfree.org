    <title>Playing Older Games and How It Can Be Hard</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/playing-older-games-and-how-it-can-be-hard/3480</link>
    <description>If you&#39;re like me, you have a hard time playing video games that have very poor-graphics. Unfortunately, for me, I have yet to play Half-Life 1, but have gone unto playing HL2, Ep. 1, and Ep. 2. Now, I know the story of HL1, but I cannot personally wait for the Black Mesa source mod to come out. So, let me ask this question to you guys tonight. Do any of you find it hard to play old games with old-graphics/textures on them? If so, has this stopped you from completing games because you found it rather boring? 

Oh, and the story is great, but I play a game, rather than read a book because I like the eye-candy that it has.</description>

            <p>No, graphics dont matter to me at all. Well actually I cant say that, I love high graphics. But I dont trash out bad graphiced games. HL1 and all the downloadable mods are still fun to play. Shit, after my 360 broke again I said fuck this (going to find a fun way to destroy the damn thing) and plugged in my N64 and played some of my old favorite games like Battletanx Global Assault, Rush , Star Wars Shadow of the Empire… and they are still very fun.</p>
<p>Speaking of the N64, just noticed the moon from Majora’s Mask ^</p>

            <p>I love my retro games.  All of you current-gen fags can have your COD.<br>
Okay, I take that back.  There are current-gen games I like, though I’m having trouble finding any that have lasting appeal.  So, when I get bored with a recent game I just go play Half-Life or Doom or an emulator.</p>

<p>I just don’t like when a game has shitty graphics for its time. Half-Life looks fine to me considering it’s release date.</p>
<p>Spiderman: Web of Shadows and F.E.A.R are examples of visually mediocre games for their time.</p>
<p>The thing is, cheesy graphics can be easily overshadowed by atmosphere, sound, and gameplay.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I bought both Codename 47 and Hitman 2: Silent Assassin on Steam a couple years ago. Then about 3 months later, I traded a few CDs to my friend for the Hitman Trilogy, which has “Hitman 2”, “Hitman: Contracts”, and “Hitman: Blood Money.”</p>

            <p>I could customise controls in 47… I dunno.</p>
<p>2, yes you can customize, it’s also where the series became very well known.</p>
<p>Contracts is essentially a remake of 47 on the newer engine.</p>
<p>And Blood Money is the best, imo. The demo, which is the Carnival level is very linear because it’s just a walkthrough to get you used to the controls. Past that, it’s not open-ended per-se, but you’re given a few objectives, and how you go about accomplishing getting to your target and the like is up to you. Whether you sneak, wear disguises, set traps, etc. or run through guns blazing is up to you.</p>

<p>Blood Money is better, imo. But Codename 47 was revolutionary for it’s time. And is fun as hell. But as Spooks mentioned, the controls are a bit wonky.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, I did play the Codename 47 demo… or at least I tried.</p>
<p>Bitching about graphics is laughable. If the gameplay is good, then who cares?<br>
…bitching about controls, however, is perfectly acceptable.<br>
Why is <span class="bbcode-i">“S”</span> walk forward slowly? And why can’t I customize anything?</p>
<p>Thankfully, I also installed the <span class="bbcode-i">Blood Money</span> demo, and had allot of fun with that. Though hopefully the full game isn’t as linear.<br>
Does <span class="bbcode-i">Hitman 2</span> have customizable controls?</p>

<p>One must first <span class="bbcode-i">learn</span> how to see the fish, young Jingles. :ninja:</p>
<p>Chiming in on the FEAR topic, it <span class="bbcode-i">was</span> unspectacular when it came to texture use and shaders, the particle effects were what made it stand out though. It was praised by critics as the game to come closest to John Woo style firefights - bullet holes, dust (lots of it), bullet time, dropkicks and whatnot. The art direction really got no points for being bleaker than a catatonic patient from me, however. You can have only so much grey and… well, grey.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way. Re: Playing Older Games and How It Can Be Hard - Have you tried playing the Serious Sam games on Serious?</p>

<p>Find me a release article that says FEAR had bad graphics? It was a damn fine looking game for it’s time, that’s all I heard and saw.<br>
.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Necroquote is necro, but it’s graphics, while good for the time, were still meh when compared to Doom 3 and Half-Life 2, which came out a year before.</p>
<p>Back then, all I remembered were people bitching about it’s unheard of system requirements, and needing a monster computer (at the time) of course, to play it.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>, I have no trouble playing old games. At least games that came out 10 years ago and more were fucking original. I love, love, LOVE older games. Gameplay is what matters, not what they look like. If a game looks <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> plays very well, then it’s all for the better, though.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/spooks">@Spooks</a>, fuck yes for Codename 47! Brofist.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jingles">@Jingles</a>, The game came out in 2000. It had fucking ragdoll physics. The game kicked incomprehensible amounts of ass.</p>
<p>Damn, I need to reinstall that on Steam…</p>
