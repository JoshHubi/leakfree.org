    <title>​IMPORTANT: Performance Fix for Day One</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/important-performance-fix-for-day-one/13821</link>
    <description>We&#39;re aware of a few performance issues related to some of the settings in the options menu. We&#39;ll be working on a fix for these soon in an upcoming patch.

[b]Extreme Framerate Drops &amp; Stuttering:[/size][/b]
You can try a couple of things if you have stuttering or poor FPS:

From the main menu go to &quot;Options,&quot; click the &quot;Black Mesa&quot; tab, and uncheck the four boxes under &quot;Performance.&quot;

These options are called &quot;Enable DLight Manager&quot;, &quot;Enable Muzzleflash DLight&quot;, and &quot;Enable Battery DLight&quot;.

[b]Possible Full Bright/No Lighting Fix:[/size][/b]
Make sure if you are using a laptop your dedicated video card is being used.

Control Panel &gt; NVIDIA Control Panel &gt; Manage 3D Settings &gt; Program Settings &gt; Add bms.exe &gt; Select Dedicated graphics card (field 2).

You can also try:

Find &#39;autoexec&#39;.cfg in SteamApps/common/Black Mesa/bms/cfg and open this file with Notepad

Add the following lines to this file:

mat_dxlevel 95
mat_fullbright 0
mat_hdr_level 2

Save the file and launch the game to see if this fixes your issue.

We are extremely sorry for the hiccups, we&#39;ll be rolling out additional patches for some of the other issues as quickly as possible over the next few days. Thanks for your patience!</description>
