The Ferrari simulator used by the drivers for their training sessions, is an incredibly complex system, efficiently reproducing the Ferrari F10&#39;s dynamic behaviour to make it realistic even while using a normal PC: this was one of the programmers&#39; main challenges. Based on an analysis of the car&#39;s official data, its aerodynamic behaviour, the tyres&#39; characteristics, the bodywork-suspension system and all of the transmission elements have been reproduced. The Ferrari Virtual Academy is mainly dedicated to a complex modelling of the differential. The single-seater&#39;s dynamic modelling was followed by comparing the telemetric data of the real F10 with the virtual one, using the circuits&#39; telemetry reproduced by Laserscan, enabling interventions regarding the set up, and the simulator&#39;s mathematical model to optimise every single component&#39;s functionality.

The drivers had the last word: they were directly involved in the production process. In different stages the Scuderia Ferrari and Driver Academy drivers used the simulator to test the car&#39;s performance, handling and dynamic behaviour, but also the tyres, with particular attention to the car&#39;s sensitivity to set up regulations.

The outcome, result of many months of hard work, is the most accurate virtual reproduction of a Ferrari F1 single-seater, available for the fans to be admired on a computer with 3D video card.

The in-depth research regarding every single detail was also applied to the Ferrari Virtual Academy circuits: creating the Fiorano circuit the graphic designers&#39; objective to recreate the scenario one experiences entering the facilities.
The graphic designers accurately reproduced the track with its layout, kerbs and the elements, which influence driving stability at low and high speeds, using avant-garde 3D-technology.

The box at Fiorano is the heart of the track and arriving there is a very special experience: therefore the box has been reproduced with every single detail, offering the fans the opportunity to experience the whole circuit.

The Fiorano race track was the brainchild of Enzo Ferrari, who wanted to build a test track for the cars from Maranello: at the circuit, and also from the track, his office building can be seen, which is until today a symbol of tradition and the legend of the Prancing Horse. The buildings at the track have been reproduced down to their smallest details and are the most accurate virtual reproduction available today. 

Pack: Nürburgring Soon Available
