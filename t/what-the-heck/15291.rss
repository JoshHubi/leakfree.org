<p>We’ve been having trouble here with Chinese and Korean spam bots making hundreds of posts. For the past few weeks, though, they’ve been under control (Thanks to Hubicorn, I assume!). You’ll notice the most recent posts are from Oct 4th I think. For whatever reason, the deleted posts stick around for a while.</p>

<p>For some reason I misread that as “We’ve been having trouble here with Chinese and Korean spam bots making posts for hundreds of years.”</p>
<p>But on topic - jaimd, don’t worry, the forum itself doesn’t have a virus. Just don’t click on any of the links in those posts and your computer will be fine.</p>
