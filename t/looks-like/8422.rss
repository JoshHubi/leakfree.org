<p>It was said that once the soundtrack is released, one could expect the launch of black mesa two weeks after. I can now say that a new website will be launched with the soundtrack in preparation for the mod. Fuck if we care about the current website. Just take a good look at it because it will be gone soon enough.</p>

            <p>Don’t really care. I’ll play it when it’s out but it does not look too promising. Most of their models look like subsurf’d versions of the originals.</p>
