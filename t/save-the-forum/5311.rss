    <description>I&#39;m afraid that every thread in the forum is starting to look like this:

[i]&lt;a topic&gt;
&lt;2 replies on topic&gt;
&lt;someone asking for a release date&gt;
&lt;flame war&gt;[/i]

Now I don&#39;t want to bitch and I&#39;m a patient guy, but can&#39;t the devs look for a PR guy or something. Because really, what&#39;s stated on the homepage of the website:

[i]Updates via twitter
follow us for [b][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]recent[/b] updates.
old school like the old school. [url]https://bit.ly/cnTITi[/url] [b][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]215 days ago[/b][/i]

That&#39;s just a bit ridiculous don&#39;t you think. I really don&#39;t care about a date, but save the forum pls.</description>

            <p>first-time IP addresses to <a href="http://forums.blackmesasource.com/*" rel="nofollow noopener">forums.blackmesasource.com/*</a> should be sent straight to the FAQ, a 3 minute timer should come up at the top of the page, and when that runs out, and the scroll bar is all the way down, it will allow them to continue, to the “<a href="http://isblackmesareleased.com" rel="nofollow noopener">isblackmesareleased.com</a>”, and after that is done posting it’s MANY useful links, they should be allowed onto the forums.  If they don’t go through all of both sites, they keep getting brought back to the FAQ with 3-minute timer.</p>
<p>And I totally missed Raminator’s update:  I’m glad to hear you guys are happy with progress.  Hope to see it by the end of winter.  Just don’t release it over generalized winter break-type dates.  Lol, I won’t have my computer…</p>

<p>Progress has been steady recently, and although we’re not quite hitting our self-imposed milestones as closely as we’d wanted to, we’re still pretty pleased with the way things are turning out. I’m sure the mod isn’t going to live up to a lot of people’s overhyped expectations given the length of time, but everyone on the team can still play it and have fun, even after all these years.

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Would be cool if this could be posted to the “Updates about the status of the mod” thread.</p>

            <p>if this mod does not look like crysis HL style i will ragepost all over these forums</p>
<p>…unlike many people i here, im active on the forums just because i enjoy them. the mod will just be a very pleasant thing when it comes out, but its not like im on here solely for that purpose. hell, i think ill find more fun admiring each and every detail of the mod because i know ill be comparing it to a retail game and going “oh wow, we need more passionate game makers out there”</p>
<p>tl;dr: i will have a nervous breakdown when the mod comes out</p>

<p>Thank you very much! This is exactly the sort of thing I’d been hoping for.  Just as a suggestion, maybe this could go in a separate sticky thread, or be put in the FAQ, or on the main page, even if it’s only just for the sake of other lurkers?</p>

<p>gee you’re right, because people never speculate as much as when they know exactly what’s going on.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, Ram said that due to the amount of work they were getting done, regardless of whether they meet their internal deadline or not, it’ll be done by the end of 12 months if they keep working at that level of efficiency. (And as that was a couple of months ago, do the math) And that also means the internal deadline is less than 12 months, so don’t worry about release dates.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t hold on to that. Just wait for it like a man.</p>

            <p>I have been saying for over three years that this whole idea/mod is a hoax and is not even real, and have been asking the devs to produce some video of someone actually playing the mod. Proof of life if you will. Thier responce was to link to lame arse box levels that show nothing more than a alternate skinned health station or door. Phht.</p>
<p>Show me some video of someone actually PLAYING BM! The only thing that I have seen is a “so-called” demo video. A demo video doesnt prove a mod exists. A video shot over someones shoulder showing a real person playing the mod gives credibility.</p>
<p>Until I see proof that the devs have done anything after 2005 besides making skins for counter strike, I am laying down the B<em>LLSH</em>T card on the devs.</p>
<p>Mod doesnt exist beyond a bunch of pictures and video that was probably created as a portfolio piece.</p>
<p>Prove me wrong!</p>
