    <title>Random Crash with Minidump</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/random-crash-with-minidump/10200</link>
    <description>Security guard just told me to clear my dance card, and I ran up to grab some ammo.  I ran back, then decided to re-check to see what ammunition was available to decide which gun to run forward with.  As I ran up to the Magnum on the hook the game just up and crashed.

Map is:  bm_c2a2b (I&#39;d just happened to grab a getpos to try something else later).

(Too bad you guys don&#39;t have a bugtracker or a github or something.)

My computer:  [url]https://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Gaming_Powerhouse/G73SW/#specifications[/url]  I have the i7 model.

            <p>Being chased by the second gargantua I decided to just make a run for it and leave a line of laser mines along the way.  When I got to the partially open doors at the end of the tunnel with the Security Guard outside the game started to stutter then it died.<br>

            <p>Another random crash.  I believe this one was on a map switch.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Actually, the map was bm_c2a4c and it was just as I fell into the radioactive room (<br>
setpos -927.479736 -2320.015869 -471.968750;setang -11.025911 -84.407860 0.000000).  Captured the location on my reload.<br>
