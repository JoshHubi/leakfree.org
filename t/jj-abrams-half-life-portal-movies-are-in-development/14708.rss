<p>Exactly! And that’s the fucking problem! Valve’s just a publisher and investor now, they haven’t directly made a game without outside contract since Portal 2 and it’s fucking infuriating.</p>
<p>I’ve waited since 2007 for a chance to continue to Episode Three and I’m getting really sick of them doing literally anything BUT Episode Three or HL3 or whatever.</p>

</aside>
<p>You’ll get over it eventually. I’ve been waiting for it until sometime near the end of 2011, at which point I gave up as it became crystal clear that they have no interest in making HL2:EP3 nor HL3. In time I found other games and many I never had the chance to play in the first place and now it’s like I never expected it in the first place. I am no longer caring about it nor ever expecting a sequel to actually happen.</p>
<p>RIP HL franchise (1998-2007) (excluding the possible movie).</p>

Maybe we can petition him to get HL3 finished.    <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>The CGI Resident Evil films were p. decent imo. Also the first MK wasn’t bad. You can’t pretend any story featured in a game is inherently incapable of being successful in a movie, that’s ridiculous. The problem is shitty studios/directors or game purists who won’t accept that it won’t be 1:1.</p>

            <p>I think if they ended the Half-Life movie with the Combine settling themselves into Earth months after the 7 Hour War that would be a nice ending - as long as we see the 7 Hour War and as long as it’s done nicely and not simply ‘explosions, shaky camera, quick movements’ that we see a lot of today. Plenty of story to bridge the gap between HL1 and HL2.  If it’s good enough they could even do a sequel about the Combine reign and the stories of Kleiner, Barney etc. and how they met up to form the resistance - and their first  battles eg. small rebellions in different cities.<br>
For the Portal movie, I don’t even know but I really hope it’s got some great dialogue. After all, there isn’t much to say if it takes place after the extermination of all scientists in the facility.</p>

            <p>I’m sort of worried. The first Portal has two characters, and you’re supposed to think one of them is a prerecorded message for nearly all of the game and the other doesn’t say a word. Portal 2 has, like, three added characters, one of which is an easter egg. I’m hoping for a prequel to the games.<br>
The Half Life movie though, seems like a good idea. It’s a game with a story and it takes place in our world, with a lot of characters to do and say things. It wouldn’t be hard to make into a movie at all.</p>

            <p>Plot twist: Half-Life 3 comes out, but it’s based on the movie instead of the other games, and because it’s a movie game, it’s inherently bad.</p>

            <p>Well, I have the DooM movie here and I enjoy it quite alot.</p>
<p>I wonder what we gonna see in both movies. Half Life is easier than Portal and no I don’t say it’s gonna be easy to make both…</p>

            <p>I’m actually really looking forward to both movies.</p>
<p>Not so much in the case of Portal since I’ve never really been into the game, but definitely hyped for HL. I just hope they’ll both be great, these are 2 franchises that really deserve a GREAT movie, not a mediocre one (the Doom movie anyone? How lame that was…). However, since Valve gave him the green light, they must have something good in store for us. At least that’s what I hope.</p>
<p>Guess we’ll have to wait and see what’s gonna be.</p>
