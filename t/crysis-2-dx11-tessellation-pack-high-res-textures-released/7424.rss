The DX11 Ultra Upgrade is a free visual improvement add-on introducing DirectX 11 support as well as a wealth of graphical improvements and performance optimization for both DX11 and DX9 API&#39;s.

When using the new “Ultra” spec, DX9 platforms will benefit from real-time local reflections and contact shadows. The owners of DX11 platforms, in addition, will be able to enjoy hardware tessellation (requires the installation of the “DX11 Ultra Upgrade”), parallax occlusion mapping and several improvements for shadows, water, particles, depth of field and motion blur.

            <p>I’ve been watching that guy’s videos all night. He’s fucking incredible at that game. He doesn’t even fuck up like I do when I play the game… I always get flanked and shat on, but that guy knows how to escape from everything. He makes it look easy.</p>

            <p>C2 was exciting when it got leaked, then the retail was less exciting due to it being so similar to the leak, infact it was the same game, except the leak had a jumpy camera during cut scenes and some dead npc’s were stuck in “civilian” position instead of, well, being dead, which didn’t affect the game because that only happened to NPC’s that were dead from the level start.</p>

            <p>Lol, agreeing with whoever said this, but mostly everyone are damn complainers. This game still looks fucking sexy.</p>
<p>I’ve been hearing everyone say how bad it is, but still I just bought it yesterday and all I can say its a solid game. Its not as bad as I thought it would be…</p>
<p>And maybe its just me but I seriously think Crysis 1 is boring as hell. I’d rather have a “linear” campaign than wander around in a jungle trying to find some koreans to strangle.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with this game except for the ai sometimes (guy threw grenade and walked into it)</p>

            <p>i downloaded the update. didn’t help at all. I was hoping the better graphics would at least give me some motivation to complete the game again but either the graphics weren’t improved much at all or the game is so bad to begin with that it didn’t matter, I barely played 10 minutes without quitting from boredom…<br>
What a shame, too. Crysis 1 is one of my favorite games of all time and Crysis 2 is less enjoyable to me than Call of Duty.</p>

            <p>Crysis 2 sans texture pack runs significantly faster than Crysis for me. Like 10fps faster at similar settings. If you can run Crysis on high, you can probably run Crysis 2 on high.</p>

<p>I got an i7 920, not overclocked though. Crysis 1 runs great on high-ish settings @ 1920x1080 so perhaps I can at least stay around the medium settings in C2.</p>

            <p>This post made my OCD twitch. The first picture. The brick wall. The brick textures aren’t lined up with the ones in the hole for the window <em>twitches</em> Perhaps I’ve been doing 3D work too long.</p>
<p>Those real-time reflections are fantastic. I remember years ago wishing things reflected, wishing things could cast real shadows in games. First time I saw the Doom 3 demo with real shadows, I was really pleased. These little things really increase the realism. Real-time global illumination and radiosity next. We have almost approached the point where a movie will be entirely made in a computer game (Cryengine, UDK, etc).</p>
<p>Wish I had a better computer at home. I’ve got a craptop, while I’ve got a bank of dual-quad xeon machines (EDIT: at work). Time for an upgrade, I think.</p>

<p>If you don’t have the balls I will throw Crysis 2 with this patch at my 5770 and see how high it can go. Once I buy Crysis 2 that is (Price is already quite good on Amazon UK so it may be soon enough.).</p>

<p>I have tried it after a little bit of research I think its not the card just my slow processor.</p>

<p>I could run Crysis 1 also on medium high but C2 runned perfectly for me. I didn’t install the patch but it would’ve made it even faster.</p>
