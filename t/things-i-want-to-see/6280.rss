    <title>things I want to see</title>

    <description>In my honest opinion I think everything so far looks very good with the mod that has been released as media, and I would like to summarize what I would like to see in the mod which are not completly as they are in Half Life 1 but I think would be wicked!

ok small one first, in the Lamda core after you are dodging the lasers at the top of the reactor you come out into a corridor and have to climb up a ladder in an elevator (elevator with a ladder in it wtf) yes it is true, well if my memory serves me correct, could make a nice physics puzzle and I thought some headcrabs jumping out of a vent on you from above at this point would also be good. even an elevator that does not work and then you have to get up into the shaft would be good, with a power failure and lights out momment.. But that in my opinion from the original was crap and possibly the only really crap part to the experience that I had.

check it here if you dont believe me

Next one more involved but would be fairly easy to execute also, I would like to see at least one scientist in a hev suit still alive in xen who is injured and you try to help him by getting water from a healing pool but when you return he is facing away from you when you get closer he turns around and has a headcrab on his head and lashes out at you, and is a bit more tough to kill than a normal zombie... Gonarchs lair would be an ideal setting for this type of small cutscene (helping him is a bluff for the sequence to occur and give hopefullly a little fright to the player)

I only just seen the health chargers from the ps2 version of half life yesterday also and think they look cool with the mechanical arm syringe attachment on them and would like to see this varient in game too.</description>

            <p>It’s <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> completely unrelated. They’re both FPS RPG hybrids with drivable vehicles, set in desert industrial environments. I don’t see how that makes them <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> similar. Sure, the storylines are separate, and game mechanics may diverge further than what I’ve seen, but until I’ve seen otherwise I just think they’re too similar.</p>
<p>Feel free to prove me wrong. In fact, I welcome you to do so, so I’ve got another game I can give a rent. Me? I’m gonna stick my money out for Deus Ex- Human Revolution, the FPS RPG hybrid set in a futuristic Renaissance and <span class="bbcode-i">without</span> any vehicle driving.<br>
(Generally I dislike it when games shoehorn driving into the game. Borderlands had that problem and that’s why I sold it. Rage seems like it’s built around the driving mechanics so hopefully it can stand out from the former and be worth a play.)</p>
<p>The Germany/America comparison is rather at odds with my current train of thought.</p>

            <p>Dude, there’s plenty of similarities. I shall now describe both games:</p>
<p>Borderlands- a self styled RPG-FPS hybrid set in a desolate wasteland based on the Mad Max films, players may proceed on foot or use vehicles to navigate the desert and kill monsters and crazy people in search of a mystical vault of alien technology.</p>
<p>Rage- Post apocalyptic shooter/racing hybrid set in a desolate wasteland based on the Mad Max films, players may proceed on foot or use vehicles to navigate the desert and kill monsters and crazy people. Additionally, there are RPG elements at work in the gameplay systems according to Wikipedia. The player emerges from a vault (more in the Fallout sense though, a bunker complex).</p>
<p>Feel free to circle which things are similar to which.</p>

            <p>It was used to great effect in “Point Insertion,” with the pacing Citizen talking about the trains. That’s how to use it properly.</p>
<p>As for that elevator map I saw on the last page, that looks pretty rad. I’d definitely want a look at the VMF to see if I can fix your elevator problem. Failing that, you can always trigger the drop to happen when the player clears the ledge. I think you could parent a playerclip or something.</p>

<p>and brokenfridgehinge: It’s not thaaat exaggerated. lol. i think a poor lil scientist in xen mumbling in fear wouldn’t be a big spoiler. it would just show the player that a horrible thing awaits.</p>
<p>EDIT: and the scientist’s gibberish doesn’t have to be audible. so it’s really not that much of a difficult scene to implement- scientist in the fetal position, with a some fun lines to read for him. It’s a good foreshadowing device and doesn’t give too much away obviously. It just lets the player know shits rough.</p>

<p>While that idea isn’t ideal, but decent. I do agree that the Nihilanth could use some build up. Because it felt kind of random at first.</p>
<p>But I have to admit, that small, quiet space platform with the red portal was very intimidating. I always remember the scientist quotes being heard near that part.</p>
<p>"Big day today, freeman. "<br>
"Thank God, you’re here! "<br>
"Get him out of there, shut down the equipment and someone get him out! "<br>
"It wasn’t meant to do this in the first place. "</p>

            <p>Fuck yeah, bro. You know what i’m talking about.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m moving that Insane HEV scientist idea to the suggestion thread hopefully to get some attention. i think the general idea is pretty simple and would be a memorable scene for players to really set the “Oh shitt…” mood before facing the final battle.</p>

            <p>^ I like it, hope they put it in the mod. I can picture the scientist now:</p>
<p>“It wants our land… it never asks but it takes…they defile us!..hes not man, hes not man…<em>screaming</em>…I just wanna go home…” :freeman: walks on while the scientist keeps rambling.</p>

            <p>It’d be neat to see an alive-but-about-to-be-fucked scientist on Xen (near the end of the game but before the Nihilanth) in a battered, war-torn HEV suit, out of his fucking mind in complete fear and disturbance, incoharently rambling on about a <span class="bbcode-i">large horrible monster</span>, therefore acting as a suspenseful device for forshadowing the Nihilanth to players who don’t know what awaits them and bc it would be a very neat scene to have in Xen.</p>
