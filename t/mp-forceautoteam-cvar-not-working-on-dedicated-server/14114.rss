    <title>[mp_forceautoteam] Cvar not working on Dedicated server</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mp-forceautoteam-cvar-not-working-on-dedicated-server/14114</link>
    <description>Since mp_forceautoteam is a cvar, it would be expected that it would work on servers, but it doesn&#39;t. it only seems to function properly on the client. I don&#39;t know if this was taken out or just wasn&#39;t attended to properly.

The first instance is the client, then the server executing the same command.
