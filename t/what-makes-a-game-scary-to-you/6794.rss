    <description>Yeah, just what the title says: What in a game do you actually consider scary, or make you jump, etc.

Me personally, is probably dark areas, no weapon and there&#39;s obviously something trying to kill you.

What are some of yours?</description>

            <p>Honestly, only two games have ever scared me.  The first one was FEAR, and I guess it was more being startled than actually scared.  FEAR has all those Alma sightings that are meant to scare the crap out of you, but are really just annoying.  The only scene in that game that ever freaked me was the one Alma scene where she comes scuttling out of a cubicle.  For some reason that one got me.</p>
<p>Then, for actually being scared and panicked, the only game that’s ever done that for me is - honestly - Opposing Force.  The sequence in the sewers, where it’s pitch black and there are Voltigores in the dark.  The night-vision goggles didn’t allow you to see very far, so you’d be creeping along, and suddenly you hear a roar and a voltigore comes charging right into your face.  The first few times I played that section, I backpedaled out of that tunnel SO fast…</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but Doom 3 was way scarier than Dead Space. One example I can give from memory is in the Delta Labs(I think its the Delta Labs). You turn this one corner and you see a zombie-demon thing holding a chainsaw at the end of the hall. As you start walking towards it, the lights start flashing, and each time the lights flash it gets closer and closer.

            <p>To me its the fact that you don’t have the ability to defend yourself, but if you do and you also do it very poorly. I.e. Resident Evil where you try to aim for headshots with scare ammo, with infinite amount of zombies, and Amnesia (you might as well be buck naked in Transilvania in a transilvanian castle with a limp. It would changes things for me if I had an arsenal of weapons or if I could manuver like a runner from mirror^'s edge.<br>
All I can think of right now.</p>

            <p>My mind tends to make games scary for me. Took me forever to beat doom 3 and thats because most of the time when ever I went into dark areas I had to think on whether I wanted to use my gun or my flashlight. Not being able to fight using a gun and a flashlight at once drove me nuts. Scared me half to death too. Then theres things like FEAR that pull me in. The second FEAR not so much, the first FEAR when you climb down the ladder and get double teamed by Alma and Fettle made me jump clear out of my chair. Dead Space only got me early on when the Necros played hide and seek, later on when I had the full arsonal not so much.</p>
<p>I guess for me it’s more of a scare to me if I don’t see whats coming. When I don’t know it’s coming. In Dark places I have a tendency to crawl into a corner and suck my thumb not wanting to face whats there. My mind making it more of a threat than it actually is. Honestly, I never played a horror game for more than 5 minutes before I need to calm down. I get REALLY jumpy.</p>

            <p>Does anyone remember the Horror Mod (yeah, I know, generic title) for Morrowind? That shit was scary the first time I played through it. A lot of dark, winding passageways, the only way you could see was by using a special torch that tended to burn out a very inopportune times, plus it was expensive as hell to buy enough of them for it to be useful. If you didn’t buy any, you would be forced to walk through complete and total blackness that was impossible to see through. The environment made the random pop-up enemies far scarier than they normally would be, and the boss creatures were hard as hell to kill. Some parts were just plain disturbing, and other parts were damn depressing. I might be making this sound a lot cooler than it probably is since I’m writing this based on my memories from the mod, but even if it doesn’t scare you its still  worth a play through for the challenge. Just make sure that if you do play it your character is pretty damn powerful and has a lot of good weapons, healing spells, and healing potions. You WILL need them. <a href="https://straygenius.com/index.php?title=Horror_Mod" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://straygenius.com/index.php?title=Horror_Mod</a></p>

            <p>I don’t want a horror game to scare me. I want a horror game to make me feel small and insignificant. I want it to inspire a huge sense of dread and primal fear on me. I want it to make me shit my pants over stuff I’m not even seeing.</p>
<p>Amnesia delivers on all those fronts. That and AvP 2000 as a marine.</p>
<p>The Dead Space games never delivered on that regard because they made the player feel empowered and powerful. They were just action games with a fair share of emphasis on the survival horror aspect.</p>

            <p>What “scares” me (I mean really makes me jump), is something popping up, suddenly, when I’m not expecting it.   But hell, I don’t have to be gaming for that to happen.  Other than that, everything else is a GAMING RUSH; that’s what really gets the juices flowing.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Honestly, I can see how Dead Space would be scary to a new generation gamer, but that fact is it was marketed to current generation gamers as a horror game, which it fails at for current generation gamers.</p>

            <p>That’s because they decided to develop it for 360, then port it PC, which is kind of odd. Hence 360 controls are absolutely amazing, but PC controls is like trying to wrestle a dead chicken while an alligator is biting your arms off.</p>

<p>Its only a horror game because the controls (at least for PC) are Horrendous :’(</p>
