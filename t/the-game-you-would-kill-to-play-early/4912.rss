    <description>Looked around, and couldn&#39;t find a thread already around about this.

[b]What game are you looking forward to most?[/b]

I personally cannot wait for The Last Guardian. I&#39;ve already preordered it, and if a Collector&#39;s Edition is announced, I&#39;ll change my preorder to that.
Seriously, I would preorder it if it was $150. It&#39;s the #1 reason I chose a ps3.</description>
