    <title>compressed air leaking from my suit??</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/compressed-air-leaking-from-my-suit/12216</link>
    <description>I feel like a real dork :retard: for asking this, but I must, for it is causing me game-play problems...

There is this compressed air coming from Freeman that makes crates (and other loose objects) fly away as I approach.  WHAT is that?  Is there a toggle switch?

Also, not sure if this related to the above, but objects are falling through the floor!  Bodies, found ammunition, health packs, Freeman-upon-dying  What is up with that!?:what:

Post 2:
Okay, there is definitely something wrong when crates are seamlessly flying through fences.  How do I correct this?

I reckon there is a fix, other than restarting the game. :freeman:

            <p>Thanks for noticing, but I didn’t do that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I had posted three separate posts, which were amalgamated automatically (perhaps since no else had yet posted) or by a forum moderator.</p>

            <p>I just want to say to OP that your rationalization for why this is happening in-universe is great.</p>

            <p>Oh, this. I sometimes find it when starting a new game from “Forget About Freeman”. I’ve only seen it in Black Mesa though, and it’s actually sort of fun until you die and end up flying through the void forever. Enough descriptions though, close the game and try again.</p>

            <p>It’s a physics error that sometimes show up in Source games. I can’t seem to remember <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> it happens, but restarting the game should fix it. Other than that, I don’t think it can be fixed while ingame.</p>

            <p>Shit, how do I even recreate this? I’ve never seen this glitch ever in any source game\mod and I really want to.</p>
