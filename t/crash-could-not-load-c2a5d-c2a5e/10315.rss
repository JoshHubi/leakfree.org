    <title>[Crash] Could not load c2a5d -&gt; c2a5e</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-could-not-load-c2a5d-c2a5e/10315</link>
    <description>Hi!

My game cant load the c2a5e section . After i went to c2a5d, and turned of the electricity there, i cant go back. The game just stucks on the loading screen. Really frustrating, since i was in c2a5e before. This kind of a crash happened before near that 3 headed boss, but there i could load the autosave from the main menu and it worked after. This solution does not work here. I dont know if there is a connection, but after i staring the game i see the blurry picture of a level section. Then suddely the whole screen switches a chestboard pattern black - purple colored thing. The loading text remains untouched. After the game loaded the main menu, the chessboard disappears, and the normal level section shows up. Tried to reinstall sdk 2007 and black mesa too. All other saves working fine.

Please figure out this one for me  :slight_smile: 

---------------------

I never played half life before. So this is my first half life experience and i am amazed on your work. I got hl2 + episodes because i must play out them after this.
