    <title>WTF is with Steam?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wtf-is-with-steam/4432</link>
    <description>This has been going on for a while now. It&#39;s happened since Steam updated itself to the sleek matte-black UI instead of the blocky green interface. This creates a new problem; I&#39;ve never even seen the games menu, because the whole program immediately freezes when it checks for updates. I&#39;m unable to do jack shit since steam is basically my whole gaming axis and steam won&#39;t do jack shit.

I have Windows Vista, if that helps</description>

</aside>
<p>Windows vista is a problem, unrelated.  Close steam, go to the steam base directory (ex: c:\Program Files\Steam), and delete clientregistry.blob and re-open steam.  Should be fixed!</p>

<p>I find Windows 7 to actually not manage memory better, but worse…when I had vista I had 3 gigs of memory…and it said 27% physical memory…well I have windows 7 64 bit home premium and guess what, I have 4 gigs of memory and my physical memory is about the same…it’s usually like in the 30’s and if I’m unlucky the high 40’s/50</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The memory usage is due to superfetch, probably being configured differently between the two operating systems. Superfetch just caches commonly used applications so that they open quicker.<br>
The majority of that used memory is likely to be your cached apps.<br>
I personally don’t know how much memory the OS uses for the stack/kernel in vista/7 though and unless that’s known then there isn’t much point in comparing their respective memory usage.</p>

            <p>try this, run msconfig and only run the bare essentials<br>
(google the app’s 1 by 1 if you have to). try running steam now, if it dont work try updating steam…</p>
<p>ccleaner wont do shit, when i first used that new UI i was running win7 32bit and the computer completely shat itself whenever steam opened, it would take like an hour to open the games section… i formatted and used win7 64bit ult + 4gb ram, now it works fine for me.</p>
<p>windows 7 is bloody good if you own a good computer. It does eat abit more ram but it uses it better i hear. Its also got dx11 support so eh. Once you get used to the UI its a whole lot cleaner to use than xp.</p>
<p>[specs: c2q q9650 <span class="mention">@3ghz</span>, msi cyclone r4890 soc, 4gb ram]</p>

<p>You could always do the upgrade, which will preserve some files, but I’d rather do a clean install.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>just a bit of info: a clean install of windows doesn’t force you to format, the XP installer just deletes Vista’s Windows folder and 7 moves Windows, Program Files and Users into C:\Windows.old</p>

<p>I find Windows 7 to actually not manage memory better, but worse…when I had vista I had 3 gigs of memory…and it said 27% physical memory…well I have windows 7 64 bit home premium and guess what, I have 4 gigs of memory and my physical memory is about the same…it’s usually like in the 30’s and if I’m unlucky the high 40’s/50</p>

</aside>
<p>Always a good idea to reformat the hard drive when you install any version of Windows. Gets rid of all the garbage files that might be screwing up your system.</p>

<p>This has been going on for a while now. It’s happened since Steam updated itself to the sleek matte-black UI instead of the blocky green interface. This creates a new problem; I’ve never even seen the games menu, because the whole program immediately freezes when it checks for updates. I’m unable to do jack shit since steam is basically my whole gaming axis and steam won’t do jack shit.</p>
<p>I have Windows Vista, if that helps</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Nothing wrong with Vista that a little tweaking doesn’t fix.</p>
