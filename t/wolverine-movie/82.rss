    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wolverine-movie/82</link>
    <description>What do you think? Was the latest XMen spinoff any good? I just saw it last night and... I had mixed feelings. Of course it did not follow the story to the letter, but I was expecting that. The special effects varied from good to sloppy. Just wondering what everyone else thought of it... I guess overall I would say I liked it.</description>

<p>wolverine is not overrated , the big attention is put on him because he is close-to-immortal , he survived most of the mutant generations , and still will , he isn’t especially cool in any way , he just has his role in the first mutations …</p>

            <p>The problem with the version i have that probably ruins a lot of it for me: Half of the CGI is incomplete. The whole ending is bscly Hugh Jackman hanging from strings with texturelesss Sabretooth model fighting some fag that I think is supposed to be deadpool.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, for some reason, my mother came home from the bar with an apparently LEGAL bootleg copy of it on DVD. She says it’s because veterans get to have everything before anybody else does. The movie is pretty cheesy.</p>
<p>God bless America.</p>

            <p>I fucking loved the 90’s X-Men cartoon. With the exception of Jean Grey’s character design. Every time I see something wrong in the movies I just end up facepalming and thinking “would it have killed them to fix that detail, it’s more important then they think” or “How do you fuck something up that badly.”</p>

<p>My oldest used to watch the 90’s X-Men cartoon and I have to admit I rather liked it myself.  Which is why I was excited to see Gambit was going to be in the movie cuz I always thought he was a cajun kewl guy.  Thing is… didn’t him and Rouge used to kinda almost like each other?  Maybe not.  Anyway, it wouldnt work well in the current X-Men world would it?</p>

<p>I still don’t really see why Wolverine is so popular though, there’s even some kids cartoon my little brother watches and it’s called something like “Wolverine and the X-Men”.<br>
Wtf? They may as well call it “The really cool badass with the claws and some freaks he hangs out with who don’t do much except the bits he can’t”. Nevermind.</p>

            <p>What do you think? Was the latest XMen spinoff any good? I just saw it last night and… I had mixed feelings. Of course it did not follow the story to the letter, but I was expecting that. The special effects varied from good to sloppy. Just wondering what everyone else thought of it… I guess overall I would say I liked it.</p>
