I know my gfx and RAM suck, but I&#39;m kinda just staring this PC gaming thing, I&#39;ve been playing games on it for a while, but never thought about upgrading till now, I compared it to my Xbox and thought that w/ upgrades this PC i&#39;d be the shiz.  

So whats the best RAM + gfx card combo I can get $100 (not including shipping) or should I cut the RAM and get a beast gfx card. I just want it to be able to play most new games like ME2, Fallout: New Vegas, Deus EX: Human Revolution, ect. at least at medium with 30+ FPS.</description>

            <p>you have to buy the motherboard separately to be able to overclock in BIOS, manufacturers like Dell, HP, etc are all douchebags that don’t give the option to overclock</p>
<p>and to use SetFSB you need to have a compatible clock generator chip (PLL)</p>
<p>also overclocking will not reduce CPU life span unless you also change the voltage beyond the maximum safe voltage for the model</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t recommend overclocking in Windows, the BIOS is the safest place to OC.</p>

<p>I wanted to OC my proscessor, but it took me a few hours to figure out that Dell PCs don’t allow it lol, I understand that OCVing give btter performance at the cost of life. Anyways, I think the Inspiron 518 has a default PSU of 300w or 350 with +12V rails or something, what PSU do I need to upgrade to for Radeon HD 5770?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>you can still OC your processor without going through the bios by a program called setfsb. You can do some stuff so it’ll start up and overclock it every time you turn on your computer too. I don’t think it’s worth the trouble though.</p>

            <p>Sorry 4 the double post but will this work with my current PCI slot and PSU?</p>

<p>I think i have either a 1.0/1.1/2.0 PCI interface and a 300w or 350w PSU that can max out at 400w</p>

            <p>The RAM you have now should be enough. Maybe buy a cheap 1gb stick, but I don’t think you really need it.</p>
<p>As for GFX card for $100, I’d highly recommend the Radeon HD 5770. Its a little more than $100 (like $120 I think), but its a huge upgrade to the integrated graphics you have now.</p>
<p>Note, though, that your processor is showing its age, you need an empty PCI-E slot in your motherboard and some Dells dont come with any, and that your power supply needs to be able to handle a new graphics card both in regards to wattage AND amperage over the 12v rails (the latter is rarely taken into consideration, even though its just as important).</p>
