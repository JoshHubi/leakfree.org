    <title>Laggy performance with Steam</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/laggy-performance-with-steam/9882</link>
    <description>Before I say anything else: You guys (the Black Mesa Team) are probably lucky that I&#39;m not physically near any of you, because you would be in danger of being  tackled and bear hugged within an inch of your life. 

Alright, that&#39;s settled. On to business. I booted up the game last night, and played for a considerable span of time until my eyelids felt like bricks and I retired for the night. 

Now, this morning, I went to boot it up, and realized i had to restart steam (because Black Mesa originally starts in a different fashion, somehow). When I restarted steam and launched the &quot;Black Mesa&quot; shortcut, it was very choppy and laggy. (Mind you, I own a machine that can run HL2 on max graphics with a 50+ framerate) 

The simplified version of this is that when it was running from the initial post-setup launch, it ran beautifully, and Steam was telling friends i was running &quot;Source SDK 2007&quot;. Now, when I boot up from the Black Mesa shortcut, it&#39;s choppy and laggy. And much to the frustration of multiple users, there&#39;s no .exe file in the BMS folder. How do we boot it up the non-laggy way?  :smiley:</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m having a very similar-sounding problem. I’ve been able to run HL2, HL2e1, HL2e2, TF2, Portal 1 &amp; 2, and the HL2 Cinematic Mod series on my machine at max or near-max settings with no problems or laggy response.<br>
I loaded the BM mod last night, and although it looks awesome, it runs like my graphics card is from the late 90s. Looks like I’m getting 5-15fps. I can’t aim, I run into doorjams, head hoppers kick my ass.</p>
<p>For me, it has run this way from the start, and does not improve after a few minutes (as has been suggested). It appears very similar to the kind of lag experienced when playing with inadequate graphics hardware, except that no matter how high or low I put the graphics settings, it doesn’t change.</p>
<p>I attempted both suggestions in this thread. Disabling the network connections had no effect. Running the game manually with the ‘-game “C:…\BMS”’ parameter switch resulted in a slight improvement but the game is still not playable.</p>
<p>I’m running Win7 Ultimate x64 with a GeForce 8600 GTS gpu on an nForce 680i LT SLI(C55P) chipset, and I’m using the latest graphics drivers for my hardware, according to nVidia; version 306.97.</p>
<p>Hoping this is resolved soon, I’ve been looking forward to this mod for a long time!  ^o^</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Update:</span><br>
After trying the fixes listed in this thread, I also tried the fixes in <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12660" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this thread</a>. Still no results. I have noticed that a couple of people have mentioned nVidia drivers might be the problem (if you’re an nVidia user anyway), and in the other thread someone recommended updating to the latest nVidia driver version that came out last month, as that solved all his lag/stuttering problems. Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, I <span class="bbcode-i">was</span> running the latest drivers. No fix for me there.<br>
Later I read someone saying they rolled their nVidia driver back to a 29x.xx version, because the latest driver was giving them crappy gameplay. So I went to the nVidia website to download a legacy driver, and decided what the hell, I’ll try the latest Beta driver first. As of this writing, the latest beta is version 310.33. I downloaded it and did a clean install.<br>
When I ran Black Mesa, it performed beautifully. No lag, no stuttering, I don’t run into door jams or get owned by head hoppers. So for any nVidia users out there, I recommend giving this fix a try.</p>

<p>There’s a “known misbehavior” (i.e. a bug) that sometimes happen when you load up savegames for the first time after starting up BM - for some levels FPS drops down to the unplayable levels and stays there for a minute or two and then goes back to normal. It is yet to be investigated what does cause this slowdown and why does it affect only a number of players while most of us seem to be unaffected by it. Thus, try starting up the game, load up save and leave your PC alone for several minutes. Then try get back to playing and hopefully you would be free from this problem for the rest of your gaming session.</p>

<p>Interesting… I booted up again this afternoon and soldiered on in slow motion lol. It eventually fixes itself after a little while…like less than a minute. It must be some kind of bug in that area.</p>

            <p>Alright. So after a system reboot, and tinkering with the graphics a little more, it’s running normally again. We (mostly me) forgot the golden rule of tech support…“turn it off and on again.”</p>

<p>Make sure you have the quotes there. Try single quotes as well if it doesn’t work. I can’t test because my mod is installed in a path without spaces. If all else fails, move the BMS directory to C:\ or something and then change your path accordingly.</p>

<p>Awesome. The quotes fixed it. The framerate is better, but not like it was before. This is really beginning to puzzle me. I’ve gone from ‘unplayable’, to ‘crappy’. When I should be getting ‘perfect’. :[</p>

<p>Well, that’s a strange sentence. Steam detected it, obviously, but something in the launch method was different, since the game it said i was playing switched. I had Steam’s in-game overlay when it was running fine, so that isn’t the problem.</p>

</aside>
<p>Steam hadn’t detected it until it was restarted. The only way to launch BM without Steam detecting it is with this method. But as Katana said above I doubt it will solve your issues.</p>

<p>This worked because I have steam in C:\Steam\ if you have it in Program Files you have to type the full path.</p>

<p>I’m very confident that this will work…but i won’t know for a bit because i poked the files a little too hard (moved stuff) and need to re-extract BMS. :facepalm:</p>

            <p>Source SDK Base is kind of locked to Steam, to my knowledge. Otherwise people could distribute mods as games without Valve’s knowledge. I’m not sure what the cause of your performance issues is, but I’m highly doubting that it’s related to Steam running.</p>

            <p>One thing you can try is unplugging your network connection and run the game in offline mode to see if maybe it’s something going on with Steam while it’s online. I don’t really think that should have any affect on the game, but it’s worth a try.</p>
<p>On a related note, mine runs fine launching from Steam. I also placed a shortcut on my desktop.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, regardless of what should be, there IS a performance difference in here, and a massive one at that. I tried reinstalling BM so that it would boot through the launcher, and it’s laggy this time as well, but it also did not label me as playing the SDK this time either.</p>
<p>So you tell me, how can I encorporate the -game BMS command to run it manually like that? I’m familiar with target lines and launch parameters but I don’t know where I would input them. I’m 90% certain if I could invoke that method of launching I wouldn’t have the lag.</p>

            <p>Before I say anything else: You guys (the Black Mesa Team) are probably lucky that I’m not physically near any of you, because you would be in danger of being  tackled and bear hugged within an inch of your life.</p>
<p>Alright, that’s settled. On to business. I booted up the game last night, and played for a considerable span of time until my eyelids felt like bricks and I retired for the night.</p>
<p>Now, this morning, I went to boot it up, and realized i had to restart steam (because Black Mesa originally starts in a different fashion, somehow). When I restarted steam and launched the “Black Mesa” shortcut, it was very choppy and laggy. (Mind you, I own a machine that can run HL2 on max graphics with a 50+ framerate)</p>
<p>The simplified version of this is that when it was running from the initial post-setup launch, it ran beautifully, and Steam was telling friends i was running “Source SDK 2007”. Now, when I boot up from the Black Mesa shortcut, it’s choppy and laggy. And much to the frustration of multiple users, there’s no .exe file in the BMS folder. How do we boot it up the non-laggy way?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
