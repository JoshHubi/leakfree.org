    <title>What are your gamma settings?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-are-your-gamma-settings/14893</link>
    <description>Does anyone else think that the gamma range we see in the games is abnormally low? I find myself typically hugging the upper end of it, and (since this can very drastically affect how certain areas in BMPD look) I&#39;m wondering if I am an outlier in that regard.

So, yeah: I keep mine set to around 2.0 or 1.8.</description>
