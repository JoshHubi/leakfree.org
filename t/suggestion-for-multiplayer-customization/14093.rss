    <title>Suggestion for multiplayer customization</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestion-for-multiplayer-customization/14093</link>
    <description>I really like the fact that the Face Creation System is available for us players in the end despite that the devs once said we won&#39;t get it.

Another thing i would like to see in &quot;Character customization&quot; is an option to choose head- and facegear for the models. Like helmets, berets, sunglasses and nightvision goggles for marines and vests for Black Mesa guards.
