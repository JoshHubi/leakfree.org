            <p>You can play Decay with just single player, lan, or online. I’ve successfully set up a server myself, and even have unlocked the bonus level where you play as Vortigons. The only problem is that there’s not really anyone else to play it with, if either player dies it’s game over for both, and there’s no way to save in the middle of a level.</p>

            <p>I actually enjoyed decay, and I used it to introduce my father to Half life. While it was just the two of us in the house for the week, I loaded it onto both our computers and We both really enjoyed it. I just like to think of it as the predecessor to Sven Co-Op and Synergy.</p>

            <p>I thoroughly enjoyed it. I helped beta test the port of it to the PC, although admittedly I don’t think they got the menu system right so I’ve never gotten around to playing it all the way through on the PC.</p>

            <p>The gameplay was a bit tedious i felt, but there were some really cool sequences, like the Medical facility housing dissected Xen creatures, and the massive convoy of Gunships flying en route to the facility, heralding the HECU intervention.</p>

            <p>split-screen co-op, lol. and i thought i failed, especially with a game like half-life where your FOV is so low. It made enemies look like the size of bowser in a mario side-scroller. They also removed your weapon from the HUD when playing co-op.</p>
