    <title>[bug?] Distance-dependant lighting origin behavior.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bug-distance-dependant-lighting-origin-behavior/15150</link>
    <description>The info_lighting FGD (and the lighting origin key value) describe lighting origin overrides as follows:

An entity that can be used to change the lighting origin of a prop_static. Set the prop_static&#39;s Lighting Origin to point at this entity to make the prop_static light as if it was at the info_lighting&#39;s origin. Good for prop_static entities that are embedded in world geometry (like rocks/windows/etc).

This, however, does not seem to be what the entity actually [i]does[/i], as the amount of light on the entity varies with its distance [i]from[/i] the lighting_origin.


Here, I have a lighting_origin and a light in a completely self-contained box outside of the main map, and a bulletin board with its lighting origin keyvalue set to that entity- if the lighting origin system worked as advertised, that [i]should[/i] mean the bulletin board would always be the same brightness (since the lighting at the info_light ent is completely determined by the single light in the box, which is kept constant). However, when I move the physical location of the box, light, and info_lighting while keeping them all fixed relative to each other, the brightness of the billboard changes.

Here it is with the box at the edge of the map:

Is this intended behavior for these entities? If so, why?</description>
