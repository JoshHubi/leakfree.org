    <title>Alien Swarm Draw Distance</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/alien-swarm-draw-distance/6536</link>
    <description>Does anyone know how I could increase the draw distance in Alien Swarm when using a remote turret?

Right now when I use the remote turret I have set up there is a nasty back clipping plane somewhere around 1200 units. What I would need though is 1400 units so the far corner across the room would not get clipped off.

I&#39;ve tried all sorts of crazy experiments with point_clientcommand and point_servercommand turning sv_cheats on and then setting r_farz to 1400. It seems point_clientcommand won&#39;t do its job.  :frowning: 

If I set the r_farz manually it works just fine.

So, is there something simple I have missed that would help me with this? Or something overly complex? Any way to make this work? Otherwise I will have to move the turret closer to the corner and I really wouldn&#39;t want to do that.</description>
