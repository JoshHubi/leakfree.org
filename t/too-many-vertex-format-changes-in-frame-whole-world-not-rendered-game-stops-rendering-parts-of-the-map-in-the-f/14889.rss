Look above the catwalk where the scientist is standing. Bunch of white stuff. It gives off the same effect as if you&#39;re staring into the void, as in, the pixel that draws &quot;nothing&quot; will repeat the last pixel (giving a &quot;hall of mirrors&quot; effect), and because of the post-processing effects (like HDR) then becomes solid white.

Meanwhile, the console spams this message:
[code]
Too many vertex format changes in frame, whole world not rendered
[/code]I guess this neatly looking teleporter room is too much for Source, so it spits out this error, and quits rendering parts of the map. 12-year-old-engine, yay.

It&#39;s only when entering the final teleporter room that the game spits out this error. The rest of the map is fine (since it&#39;s not rendering the entire teleporter room all the time).</description>

            <p>Well the error itself is at least as old as the engine itself, it wasn’t introduced later on. I’ve seen threads on now-empty forums dating all the way back to 2005-2006. That’s a looooong time ago.</p>

            <p>I’ve been noticing sudden errors of this type in the pre-disaster maps as well, in areas that were previously fine.</p>
<p>I think something either <span class="bbcode-i">decreased</span> the engine’s total rendering budget (??) or prevented some of its optimization elements from working.</p>
