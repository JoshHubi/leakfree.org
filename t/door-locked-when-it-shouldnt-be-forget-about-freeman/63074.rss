    <title>Door LOCKED when it shouldn&#39;t be - Forget about Freeman</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/door-locked-when-it-shouldnt-be-forget-about-freeman/63074</link>
    <description>I&#39;m PRETTY sure this door is meant to be open is it not? I&#39;ve checked walkthroughs and all sorts. The door for them is just open. The lock cannot be destroyed, I cannot jump over the fence and there is also nothing else in this small area that can help me progress.

Is this a bug or am I missing something?

            <p>Okay, not a problem, that would be fine BUT I tried to do that and there is an invisible wall there. I can’t hop over the fence at all</p>

            <p>The 1.0 beta made it unopenable and forced the player to climb the pipes to the side of it.</p>
<p>I do not know why.</p>

            <p>Shoot the lock? Not crowbar, that usually doesn’t go through barriers.<br>
Could be that there is an event that you skipped.</p>
