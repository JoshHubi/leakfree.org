    <description>Something about creating a gateway to another dimension

A top boffin at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) says that the titanic machine may possibly create or discover previously unimagined scientific phenomena, or &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; - for instance &quot;an extra dimension&quot;.

&quot;Out of this door might come something, or we might send something through it,&quot; said Sergio Bertolucci, who is Director for Research and Scientific Computing at CERN, briefing reporters including the Reg at CERN HQ earlier this week.


 
The LHC, built inside a 27-km circular subterranean tunnel deep beneath the Franco-Swiss border outside Geneva, functions like a sort of orbital motorway for extremely high-speed hadrons - typically either protons or lead ions.

The differences are, firstly, that the streams of particles are moving at velocities within a whisker of light speed - such that each stream has as much energy in it as a normal car going at 1000mph. Secondly, the beams are arranged in such fashion that the two streams swerve through one another occasionally, which naturally results in huge numbers of incredibly violent head-on collisions.

These collisions are sufficiently violent that they are expected to briefly create conditions similar to those obtaining countless aeons ago, not long after the Big Bang, when the entire universe was still inconceivably small - it was smaller than a proton for quite some time, seemingly, still with all the stuff that nowadays makes up all the supra-enormity of space and galaxies and so forth packed in somehow.

Naturally, some extremely strange phenomena are to be expected when one mangles the very fabric of space-time itself in this fashion. Various eccentric nutballs have claimed that this would doom humanity in one fashion or another; perhaps converting the entire Earth, everything on it and possibly the rest of the universe too into &quot;strangelet soup&quot;, monopole mulligatawny or some other sort of frightful sub-particulate blancmange or custard.

It has also been suggested that cack-handed boffins at the LHC might inadvertently call into being a miniature black hole and carelessly drop this into the centre of the Earth, rather irritatingly causing the planet to implode. It&#39;s certainly to be hoped that the button marked &quot;Call Black Hole Into Being&quot; on the control board has some kind of flip-down cover over it.

Obviously all that&#39;s utter rubbish. But some boffins have speculated that black holes might alternatively act as spacewarp wormhole portals into alternate universes, or something. This would seem to chime with Bertolucci&#39;s remarks this week on hyperdimensional &quot;doors&quot; out of which might come unspecified &quot;somethings&quot;.

no but they will turn it on, run some tests, be a few million more in debt and no one will give a shit in a few years.</p>

<p>Man 1: “Hey, did you hear about that scientist that fell into that vat of toxic waste?”<br>
Man 2: “No.  What kind of super powers did he get?  Can he shoot ice out of his fingers?  Is he able to turn invisible?  Fly?  Able to watch Jon and Kate for more than 30 seconds without cringing?”<br>
Man 1: “No.  He got a brain tumor and died.”</p>

<p>Even if there where in fact aliens coming through it (although that’d be utterly absurd, and won’t happen) why’d we assume they want war with us? There has never before been done this kind of thing so those idiots just watched too much sci-fi movies.</p>

            <p>Appartantly they could have it running as soon as this weekend, perhaps it will coincide with the release of BM (not necessarily in the weekend though).<br>
Also. was going to post this last night, but too tired, and you beat me too the post this morning.</p>

            <p>Something about creating a gateway to another dimension</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A top boffin at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) says that the titanic machine may possibly create or discover previously unimagined scientific phenomena, or “unknown unknowns” - for instance “an extra dimension”.</p>
<p>“Out of this door might come something, or we might send something through it,” said Sergio Bertolucci, who is Director for Research and Scientific Computing at CERN, briefing reporters including the Reg at CERN HQ earlier this week.</p>
<p>The LHC, built inside a 27-km circular subterranean tunnel deep beneath the Franco-Swiss border outside Geneva, functions like a sort of orbital motorway for extremely high-speed hadrons - typically either protons or lead ions.</p>
<p>The differences are, firstly, that the streams of particles are moving at velocities within a whisker of light speed - such that each stream has as much energy in it as a normal car going at 1000mph. Secondly, the beams are arranged in such fashion that the two streams swerve through one another occasionally, which naturally results in huge numbers of incredibly violent head-on collisions.</p>
<p>These collisions are sufficiently violent that they are expected to briefly create conditions similar to those obtaining countless aeons ago, not long after the Big Bang, when the entire universe was still inconceivably small - it was smaller than a proton for quite some time, seemingly, still with all the stuff that nowadays makes up all the supra-enormity of space and galaxies and so forth packed in somehow.</p>
<p>Naturally, some extremely strange phenomena are to be expected when one mangles the very fabric of space-time itself in this fashion. Various eccentric nutballs have claimed that this would doom humanity in one fashion or another; perhaps converting the entire Earth, everything on it and possibly the rest of the universe too into “strangelet soup”, monopole mulligatawny or some other sort of frightful sub-particulate blancmange or custard.</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that cack-handed boffins at the LHC might inadvertently call into being a miniature black hole and carelessly drop this into the centre of the Earth, rather irritatingly causing the planet to implode. It’s certainly to be hoped that the button marked “Call Black Hole Into Being” on the control board has some kind of flip-down cover over it.</p>
<p>Obviously all that’s utter rubbish. But some boffins have speculated that black holes might alternatively act as spacewarp wormhole portals into alternate universes, or something. This would seem to chime with Bertolucci’s remarks this week on hyperdimensional “doors” out of which might come unspecified “somethings”.</p>
