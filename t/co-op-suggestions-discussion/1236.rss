    <description>[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]raw_bean edit: Bear in mind the current dev standpoint on Co-op is that it will [b]NOT [/b]be in the initial release of BM. Addition of the co-op mode at a later date remains a possibility.

There was a thread months ago with the same topic, but because of the crash it isn&#39;t existent anymore.

But I think it is important to figure out solutions for several problems + suggest and discuss any features, which would be nice to have:

Here we go:

[b]1. Map change trigger:[/b]
When should a map change start?

[i]1.1 If one player reaches the map change entity trigger?[/i]

[i]1.2 Only if every player reaches a map change area?[/i]
(would be a problem, if a player is currently afk or blocked by an object)

[b]2. Weapon, ammo, Item, health and energy transition:[/b]
The biggest fun killer in co-op mods like Sven Co-op was the fact, that you weren&#39;t able to take your weapons with you into the next level. In BM co-op, the HUD and weapon status should be transfered on map change.


[b]3. Weapon &amp; ammo dropping:[/b]
Should it be possible to be able to give others your weapons and ammo? At least in SC it was fun to give others your ammo or weapons, if they run out of ammunition. Maybe this feature should also be added to BMC.

[b]4. Weapon and ammo:[/b]

[i]4.1 Should the optimized Black Mesa co-op maps offer more weapons and ammo, so that all players get everything or should the players ration it by themself?

4.2 Should all weapons and ammo appear for every player seperately (all items exist at the same place, but every player only sees one, which is for himself) to prevent any injustices?[/i]

[b]5. The suit:[/b]
I think a nice solution would be to have a suit for every player in the different suit containers, instead of let them take the same suit at the same position.  The only problem would be, that co-op is planned for 4 players, but there are only 3 suit containers in that room.

[b]6. Death: What should happen, if a player dies?[/b]
[i]
6.1 Should there exist unlockable spawn points (which are unlocked, if a player reaches them while), where he can simply respawn?[/i]

[i]6.2 Should the other players simply have to play the rest of the map without him (dead players would first respawn in the next map again)? [/i]

[i]6.3 Should all players have to play the whole map again?[/i]

[b]7. Health and Power:[/b]
Should it be able to heal other players or to give them energy?
Maybe players could also be able to transfer their suit energy (only for energy not health, because that wouldn&#39;t make sense) to another player.

And btw: I don&#39;t know how it is handled in other mp games, but will all the players see the dynamic shadows from another players flash light? And doesn&#39;t it look strange, if a flash light shines from nowhere?</description>

            <p>you know I really can’t imagine the main game working as a co-op. I theorised that the devs are secretly making a source version of Decay to go along, but ram destroyed all my hopes. But now I’m not so sure, it should be BM’s conspiracy theory.</p>

            <p>Hey, if you want intuitive, add in the “B’MARPEK” I was just offering a method by which no new buttons needed to be mapped, yet no new “weapons” needed to be added. I just said it would be interesting if you did it that way, not intuitive.</p>

            <p>actually, that would be interesting. Make alt fire while holding the crowbar = give health kit, and reload while holding the crowbar = give extra ammo for whatever weapon the other person is holding. I’d personally prefer to have the ability to give suit power as well, but the health and ammo are really the most important parts and give functionality that is equivalent to what has been seen in HL1 and HL2 from NPCs.</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t it be physitastic if crowbarring a comrade distributed HEV power evenly between the two?<br>
With a spark, of course… wait, the gloves do not absorb power… Nevermind then.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>True, but with all due respect I must operate under the assumption that idea won’t come to fruition. I must do this because I recall a developer commenting that enemies will not be increased in number or difficulty (although a server-operator has the option of modifying their skill-configuration file to increase the health/damage of enemies).</p>
<p>It is difficult, or impossible, to cast the disadvantage of a friend’s death as coming from the enemy, since many of the players will have plenty of experience fighting through Black Mesa by themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The whole reason I suggested the larger enemy spawns (not all at once, but such that the spawn period lasts longer in order to go through the larger number of enemies) was to have that disadvantage from the enemy. If they were to die in the middle of combat, that would leave whoever else was there to deal with the remaining enemies alone. It might not be a HUGE disadvantage, but it’d still be a disadvantage.</p>

<em>ahem</em><br>
One resents their friends for shooting them, and this happens. One resents their friend for dying frequently in a game where you may revive their body. One also resents their friend if they are unable to reach one’s own body for revival. This is a natural part of games with close-knit players. (I almost want to avoid saying “team” to stress this aspect… You may notice me using the term “family”.)Continuing onto your next point about great pickup games, I am reminded of a round of Battlefield 2. I was a medic, and there was a special forces on my team. The server was not very dense… but I had joined in a squad with this man and followed him around. I followed the crap out of him, killing enemies and covering his back, and we went about whatever petty objectives were listed for that map, together as an unstoppable force. Together we were a vector of immense magnitude. When he would die, I would catch him. When we were injured, I would heal us. When it was my turn to be murdered, <span class="bbcode-i">he</span> would take the role of a medic and revive <span class="bbcode-i">me</span>. I’ve never felt such a close relationship with another player as I did that round, and it was a stranger on one map. My brother in arms and I had mastered urban combat in enemy territory, not with constant communication or microphone usage but with pure intuition as an army of two. Very rarely did we feature any true deaths with this self-support system.[/size]<br>
Erm, what was the point here… ah, yes:<br>
If you stick close to another player, and your life is dependent on another’s survival, you might be able to find this incredible bond. The quasinonymous nature made it all the more unlikely, but kept chatter to a bare minimum, and that usual chatter was replaced by pure determination to protect one’s comrade from harm.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I totally understand where you’re coming from. I had one guy hop in a random game of Decay with me. No clue who he was, but we made HUGE progress. Eventually he left to do something else. I never saw him again. Kind of a shame, really.<br>
Still though, just because the game mechanics I’m talking about are intended to keep games from being utterly abysmal when you have crappy teammates doesn’t mean that they will stop games from being awesome when you have good team mates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will avoid commenting on your race-mode suggestion, as it’s not my field… I play patiently and defensively.</p>

<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>I agree that many new buttons (as found in Synergy) let most of the convoluted features go underused. Only one feature should warrant a button, and that would probably be dropping ammunition.<br>
SvenCoop’s medkit (a rip from TFC’s medic) was, I found, very peculiar. It didn’t mesh well while trying to incorporate things into a singleplayer campaign. The whole idea of a supportive weapon feels as if it’s borrowed from games with conflicting teams. +Use-ing another player feels less out of place, although I’m not quite sure what it should accomplish.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think it makes complete sense for health and suit power to be covered as well. In HL2, the citizens could provide both ammo and health. Other scientists could also give you a health boost in HL1. Seems strange that other team members couldn’t do the same. It makes sense that you would be able to supply suit power as well, but not other citizens and scientists, as you have an HEV suit, but they don’t.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Depends on the order they respawn in, and what HP any poor survivor has :lol:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">The Halftax-Method:</span> {<span class="bbcode-i">0, 0, 0, 100</span>} -&gt; {<span class="bbcode-i">25, 0, 0, 88</span>} -&gt; {<span class="bbcode-i">22, 29, 0, 77</span>} -&gt; {<span class="bbcode-i">20, 26, 32, 68</span>}</p>
<p>Well that’s not so bad, is it? That’s the price of widespread death. One player with 100% becomes 4 players who have 146% [exceeding the expected square root of 2 (141.42%) due to ceiling at each calculation]. Keep in mind Barneys don’t have more than 35, Barneys have little human skill, and Barneys don’t able to pick up health and armour.</p>
<p>I’m going to propose players have to restart a level the moment the average health drops below the number of players. If any one player retains 1hp (alone), 2hp, 3hp, or 4hp, the family may keep respawning. If everybody is worked down to 1hp and somebody dies, you lose - try again.</p>
<p>As for my previous post, here is what would happen if we don’t punish those below average:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">The Charitable-Halftax:</span> {<span class="bbcode-i">0, 0, 0, 100</span>} -&gt; {<span class="bbcode-i">25, 0, 0, 88</span>} -&gt; {<span class="bbcode-i">25, 29, 0, 77</span>} -&gt; {<span class="bbcode-i">25, 29, 33, 68</span>}</p>
<p>One player with 100hp becomes 4 players who have 155hp. I like this method. It’s especially noticeable in this example, as the first one to respawn is not punished… they are simply not rewarded by the additional benefits a healthier-than-thou team would provide them with.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Comrade Tiki</span> is a strong proponent of the <span class="bbcode-b">Charitable-Halftax</span> approach,<br>
where a living player’s health is not deducted to lower than the average,<br>
where healthier players make small sacrifices to keep the family afloat,<br>
where the overwhelming injury and death of all players is akin to defeat.</p>

<p>Yes, it makes other players more likely to die. It’s as if every player has one full life. If your one friend dies, you both may continue to play with one half-life. . But it’s not as if it kills them, they’re still just as lethal to monsters. And more players means it’s easier to find every ounce of health in a level, while the enemies in a game are dying more rapidly and dealing no more damage than usual.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, my idea was to also have enemy spawns increase based on the number of players. Hence with more players enemies DON’T die more rapidly.</p>

<p>Well, i also mentioned that a new life should also give a small ammo boost, but the primary purpose is actually to get you OUT of an area that is currently killing you.

<p>In my experience, forcing this effect by taxing other players only fosters resentment, as the disadvantages are coming from your fellow players. In order to encourages teamwork, the disadvantages to losing teammates need to come from an external source(ie, the enemy).</p>

</aside>
<p>You could be right. I just find that the biggest weakness that any multiplayer game has is supporting anything even approaching a decent pickup game. You either spend half your time searching for players who are actually decent and can fit into your schedule for playing together, or you spend half your time in ass crap games banging your head over how frustrating other players are. If Black Mesa is going to do co-op. I think they should take the opportunity to really push the envelope, and not just say “well, it’s as good as anything else out there, so it’s good enough” when they could be making it better.</p>

<p>You must admit, culling a leader’s effectiveness is an interesting way to promote an even distribution of action. It’s a wonderful feature but it would need to be optional.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I honestly don’t think it should be <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> optional. If you’re racing that far ahead, it means you’re either taking down enemies like a blur and can handle, or even welcome, having the damage you do cut down a bit, or you’re not even bothering to shoot at the enemies and just flying through the level, so it’s not even going to matter. If you just want to race through a level and forget the rest of the team, you might as well just play single player.<br>
UNLESS it’s a RACE. Race Mode would be awesome. You could have stats based on how fast each level is completed and players can gain stats/achievements based on winning the most races or having the fastest total time, or the fastest time for an individual map section.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not entirely true, at least if it can be implemented properly. The enemy spawn itself would simply have teh number of enemies in that spawn change dynamically based on the number of players who are within a specific distance of that spawn. It shouldn’t be much harder than placing the spawn point itself. If “Rambo” is being kept with the rest of the group, then this method of individual player based enemy spawns will simply cause a larger enemy spawn that is more like the game being scaled to give an equivalent challenge level to the larger number of players.</p>

</aside>
<p>Sven coop had an item that allowed you to heal other players, it wasn’t hard to figure out, I just didn’t like how it only did 1 thing when it would have been more convenient to handle everything. I found Synergy’s method of simply having extra buttons to be annoying. I ended up never healing or giving ammo to anyone else, simply because I had to reach for buttons I wasn’t used to pressing, and usually in situations that I was being pressured by the enemy myself and didn’t really have time to leisurely get to the buttons I needed. There are other mods out there where servers modify the mount of health and ammo you can keep, so changing how much this will hold really isn’t that big of a deal.</p>

<p>And finally, jumping back to the respawn idea:<br>

</aside>
<p>Actually, that’s what I had initially wanted to do, but forgot about it as I was typing. I wanted it to be set so that at the beginning of maps and respawn points, your health and ammo would be recorded, if you got killed, you would reappear at the respawn point with the health, suit power, and ammo you had when you reached it. Much better idea than what I had put down of fully replenishing health and ammo and whatnot.</p>

            <p>A lot of these issues can be easily resolved by playing with people you know and trust. Left 4 Dead is a pretty good example of this (being four player online Co-Op), where, if someone wants, they can pretty much ruin the game for the other three players. It is this fact that has driven me away from playing L4D with random people. I only play if my friends / steam acquaintances organise a campaign. Versus mode is pretty much unbearable in any case  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  .</p>
<p>Judging by the amount of morons (none of you ^_^) on the forums I doubt I’d be playing with any randoms when/if the Co-Op section for BM comes out.</p>
<p>I stand by my previous^ suggestions. Sven Co-op seems to have done it fine for me.</p>

<p>I like the idea of automatically balancing damage infliction to discourage one player from taking all of the glory, but this spontaneous-enemy suggestion is radically different from singleplayer, nay, from Half-Life in general. Especially if the “point man” is weakened, I don’t think there’s much difficulty keeping four or fewer people together. It would only create MORE obstacles between the harbinger and overwatch.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think you’re misunderstanding my idea a bit. I never intended for the “pointman” to be at a disadvantage, only the ones who are entirely too far ahead for other people to be able to catch up before he reaches the end of the level. If you were within sight or shooting distance of the other players, there should basically be no damage adjustment at all. Also, it would NOT be set up so that if there are 3 players, then there will be 3x the enemies at each spawn. If the first player reached the spawn ahead of everyone else, then 1 spawn would be triggered, if he dealt with them then he could keep moving. If the next 2 players showed up at that point later, then they would trigger two spawns, supposedly stragglers that came in after the first player left.<br>
While there would be twice as many enemies as what the first player had to deal with, that doesn’t mean that all those enemies would show up at once, but that they would keep filing/warping into the area until you finally ran through twice the number of enemies. On top of this, there would be both of those 2 players to deal with these enemies. If you’ve ever played synergy, then you should know that just adding a single extra player can make enemies drop DRASTICALLY faster, and that’s not even touching on the fact that because these players are trailing behind the leading player, they’ll have a boost to the damage they deal out.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I have no complaints.<br>
Considering the number of ideas cloistered together, that is equal to support.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Servers can remember players, and keep track of campaign sessions. It seems only logical to remember the equipment (and statistics, if there are any) of the co-op players in the case one gets disconnected.</p>
<p>Individual maps, now, should ensure players always start out with at least the expected weapons and items, new to the campaign or not. You cannot go to Xen without a longjump module, and you cannot go through Unforeseen Consequences without an HEV. This makes the former-comrade-rejoining circumstance very acceptable. (New players would receive the weapons up to that map, but very limited ammunition compared to someone who was playing but had dropped.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>pretty much exactly my idea.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t like the idea of armor/health coming from another player. I <span class="bbcode-b">do</span> like the idea of dropping ammunition based on whatever is held by whoever’s in your reticle, it makes a boatload of sense (since you wouldn’t give ammo to someone unless you can see them nice-and-close).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Using my “weapon” idea, you could easily have variables that disable any of the “weapon’s” features or remove it entirely, while at the same time not requiring you to learn or bind new keys. If you’re having trouble justifying the “weapon’s” existence then maybe it might feel less jarring if it was the “black mesa all-purpose restockable portable emergency kit” or “B’MARPEK” If you only wanted it to handle reloading weapons, then just play on a server in which the variables are set to only allow weapons to be reloaded, but HL2 already gave the NPCs the ability to give you health as well as ammo, so I don’t see why it would seem strange for you to be able to give other players excess health or suit power that you picked up. Heck, that’s an integral part of team play, and of course it would depend on you being a stronger player as well, since you would only be able to add suitpower, health and ammo to the “B’MARPEK” AFTER you’ve first completely filled your own personal reserves.<br>
Also, this is integral to the idea about items drops, where each item appears individually for each person, so that no one can hog ammo or health. Since no one else can get extra ammo, health or suit power, the only way to help a weaker player to keep up is for stronger players to give extra health and ammo they’ve picked up. to be completely fair though, this really needs to be done at the stronger player’s discretion (they were the ones putting the work into conserving their ammo and health after all)</p>

<p>I do like the idea of all HEVs being in their positions…</p>
<p>But, if you’ll jump back to my response-before-last, I would like to mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one HEV-clad Gordon is required to open up the door to the next area.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Unforeseen Consequences boots up, all players will be equipped with an HEV. They don’t need them before then. So I would like to suggest that the one suit remain as it is, and not respawn.</p>
<p>Although respawning suits aren’t that bad either. Really, it’s unimportant.</p>

<p>There’s some appeal to a significant punishment for dying. That way, one player would need to survive through the whole level to continue, which would make sense in the context of a campaign. Infinite respawns would make it too easy. (And I think peppering each map with progressive spawn points is too much work.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, there’s SOME appeal. However if you happen to make a stupid mistake, fall off a narrow ledge and DIE right at the beginning of the level, how much fun is it going to be to have to wait for the all the other players to finish before you can get back into the thing? I don’t know about you, but I’d just drop out entirely at that point.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Respawns, though, are still acceptable. I would like to <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">firmly suggest</span></span> the following consideration be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a player dies, they respawn with HP that is the average of all players in the game (including themselves).</li>
<li>With 4 players, each player’s health is reduced to 3/4 of what it was (to nourish the new player). This is a reduction to (N-1)/N times the health, with a minimum value of 1/2.</li>
</ul>
<p>I firmly believe in this respawning method.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
If 1 of 4 players die, and the other 3 have 75 health, the total health is 225. The average health is right below 57. (I suggest ceiling in the case of health so players never spawn with 0.) The new player gets 57 health. Each player with 75 health gets 3/4 of that to compensate, which is also 57.</p>
<p>(If a surviving player had 50 health instead, he’d go down to 38… and another player with 100 would go down to 75. This is a proportional sacrifice from each survivor used to fuel the new body.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No.<br>
Just no.<br>
I understand your logic here, but this is perhaps one of the most naive ideas I’ve seen. It also highlights the fundamental problems of socialism, but that’s beside the point.<br>
This punishes other players for one person’s lack of skill, not only that but it HOBBLES other players and makes it more likely for them to ALSO die, creating a viscious cycle where they die and steal health from other players and make it even hard for THEM to stay alive. Griefers could also use this to deliberately irritate other players.</p>
<p>Now what might be reasonable is that each person has 3 - 5 “lives” at the beginning of the game. Whenever you reach a respawn point, you not only activate it, but if you’ve lost lives before reaching it, it will replenish one of the lives you had lost. Obviously these shouldn’t be EXCESSIVELY placed, but 1 - 3 per map (depending on map size and difficulty) could make things much more bearable.<br>
When you die, you respawn at either the beginning of the map, or whichever latest respawn point you’ve activated. You would have full health, and your suit power would be the average of all the other players on the map (it would not drain their suit power at all though) and you would still have whatever ammo you had when you died (though maybe give you a single ammo refill for each of your weapons, 1 grenade, 18 bullets if you only have the handgun, 50 bullets if you have the rifle, 8 shotgun shells, 1 rocket for the rocket launcher, 20 gauss gun energy charges, etc)<br>
If you burned through all of your lives, you would have to wait until the other players finished the level, but then you would join back in with both full health, average suit power, but limited ammo. If you needed more ammo, you would have to count on other players to provide you their excess at that point.</p>

            <p>I support all players reaching the level transition, and loading according to their previous position (like singleplayer, for the closest attainable gameplay immersion). This isn’t your typical multiplayer with 32 gunmen running around.</p>
<p>It’s acceptable that the story won’t be as consistent with multiple Gordons, but having each player drop from a predetermined spawn point gives the impression it’s another disjointed multiplayer war-game.</p>

<p>If this were to be implemented, I would also like to see individual enemy spawns. Essentially, if you had a point where a battle would take place, each player would provoke their own enemy spawn.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like the idea of automatically balancing damage infliction to discourage one player from taking all of the glory, but this spontaneous-enemy suggestion is radically different from singleplayer, nay, from Half-Life in general. Especially if the “point man” is weakened, I don’t think there’s much difficulty keeping four or fewer people together. It would only create MORE obstacles between the harbinger and overwatch.</p>

 Grey Acumen:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’d really like is if you could have a coop setting called “campaign mode” which would actually allow whoever is running the game to create a save point in which each player’s weapons, ammo, health, and progress would be recorded so that you could put the game down and pick it back up. If you had someone drop out after joining in, and then everyone else kept playing, the person who dropped out would have their individual health and ammo preserved, but the next time they joined back in, they would start at the beginning of the new map that everyone else was on, and would gain any weapons that were introduced in the previous maps (but without ammo)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have no complaints.<br>
Considering the number of ideas cloistered together, that is equal to support.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Servers can remember players, and keep track of campaign sessions. It seems only logical to remember the equipment (and statistics, if there are any) of the co-op players in the case one gets disconnected.</p>
<p>Individual maps, now, should ensure players always start out with at least the expected weapons and items, new to the campaign or not. You cannot go to Xen without a longjump module, and you cannot go through Unforeseen Consequences without an HEV. This makes the former-comrade-rejoining circumstance very acceptable. (New players would receive the weapons up to that map, but very limited ammunition compared to someone who was playing but had dropped.)</p>

<p>I would like to see this implemented as a new “weapon” perhaps have it in place of where the gravity gun would normally go.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t like the idea of armor/health coming from another player. I <span class="bbcode-b">do</span> like the idea of dropping ammunition based on whatever is held by whoever’s in your reticle, it makes a boatload of sense (since you wouldn’t give ammo to someone unless you can see them nice-and-close).</p>

</aside>
<p>I do like the idea of all HEVs being in their positions…</p>
<p>But, if you’ll jump back to my response-before-last, I would like to mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one HEV-clad Gordon is required to open up the door to the next area.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Unforeseen Consequences boots up, all players will be equipped with an HEV. They don’t need them before then. So I would like to suggest that the one suit remain as it is, and not respawn.</p>
<p>Although respawning suits aren’t that bad either. Really, it’s unimportant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2nd idea wasn’t much better, it would be an absolute bitch for the player who died. Sure it’s incentive not to die, but then there’s also no incentive to not just drop out once you’ve died.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There’s some appeal to a significant punishment for dying. That way, one player would need to survive through the whole level to continue, which would make sense in the context of a campaign. Infinite respawns would make it too easy. (And I think peppering each map with progressive spawn points is too much work.)</p>
<p>Respawns, though, are still acceptable. I would like to <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">firmly suggest</span></span> the following consideration be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a player dies, they respawn with HP that is the average of all players in the game (including themselves).</li>
<li>With 4 players, each player’s health is reduced to 3/4 of what it was (to nourish the new player). This is a reduction to (N-1)/N times the health, with a minimum value of 1/2.</li>
</ul>
<p>I firmly believe in this respawning method.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
If 1 of 4 players die, and the other 3 have 75 health, the total health is 225. The average health is right below 57. (I suggest ceil()ing in the case of health so players never spawn with 0.) The new player gets 57 health. Each player with 75 health gets 3/4 of that to compensate, which is also 57.</p>
<p>(If a surviving player had 50 health instead, he’d go down to 38… and another player with 100 would go down to 75. This is a proportional sacrifice from each survivor used to fuel the new body.)</p>

(would be a problem, if a player is currently afk or blocked by an object)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is the hardest part about coop to deal with. Personally, I think it would be best if it was handled like Synergy, where the first person reaching the change entity trigger will start a timer which everyone else must reach the end before it runs out, then if everyone gets there, the map chaneg takes place immediately.<br>
However more than that is needed. I would like to see dynamic obstacles and enemies, though this would likely be incredibly hard to implement. Essentially my idea would consist of the game actually tracking the players’ progress through each map and giving handicaps to the damage done by players based on how far ahead or behind the average they are.<br>
If you are really far ahead of everyone else, your weapons do less damage to enemies, and crates and planks are harder to break with the crowbar. You can still progress, but that progress is hampered. If you are far behind, your damage is increased so you can break and kill things faster to catch up easier.<br>
If this were to be implemented, I would also like to see individual enemy spawns. Essentially, if you had a point where a battle would take place, each player would provoke their own enemy spawn. This would mean that if someone reached an area first and killed all the enemies before anyone else got there, then a new enemy spawn would take place so that the people who were following behind would still be able to get some fighting in.<br>
Of course, these enemies would need to disappear after that individual player left the general vicinity, or else you could have someone racing through, activating enemy spawns and then leaving them behind to further slow down players who were already falling behind.<br>
Individual player based spawns would also allow players who were actually sticking together to have more enemies to deal with, allowing battles to be balanced no matter how many players you had or how well your group was(or wasn’t) sticking together.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually, there’s currently no problem with items and weapons transitioning from map to map. The problem is that there is no way to SAVE the progress you make. What I’d really like is if you could have a coop setting called “campaign mode” which would actually allow whoever is running the game to create a save point in which each player’s weapons, ammo, health, and progress would be recorded so that you could put the game down and pick it back up. If you had someone drop out after joining in, and then everyone else kept playing, the person who dropped out would have their individual health and ammo preserved, but the next time they joined back in, they would start at the beginning of the new map that everyone else was on, and would gain any weapons that were introduced in the previous maps (but without ammo)</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m putting these both together because I have one solution that addresses both issues. I would like to see this implemented as a new “weapon” perhaps have it in place of where the gravity gun would normally go. The “weapon” would use primary fire to give health to other players, secondary fire would give suit charge to other players, and pressing the reload button would give ammo to whatever weapon the receiving player was holding. The “weapon” would be filled with whatever excess ammo, health, or suit chargers you came across once your own health, suit, or weapons were fully stocked. There would be limits to how much ammo, health and charge each player’s “weapon” can hold though.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4. Weapon and ammo:</span></p>
<p>[i]4.1 Should the optimized Black Mesa co-op maps offer more weapons and ammo, so that all players get everything or should the players ration it by themself?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Dude, did you steal this idea from one of my previous posts? 4.2 is the perfect way to do things. If an individual player needs more ammo than what is dropped standardly, then that can be taken care of through the “weapon” I specified in the previous section. With this, I would also like to see health and charge stations handled the same way.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">5. The suit:</span><br>
I think a nice solution would be to have a suit for every player in the different suit containers, instead of let them take the same suit at the same position.  The only problem would be, that co-op is planned for 4 players, but there are only 3 suit containers in that room.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is pretty simple. Have all 3 suit stations active in multiplayer, but then have a new suit come up from below to restock each suit station after 1 has been taken. Sure, the 4th guy has to wait for it, but that’s still manageable. I recall it being mentioned that Black Mesa coop was planned to be designed around the idea of 4 players, but not to be fixed to that amount in any way. So people may use only 2 or 3, or may possibly use even more players. So having each of the suit stations as auto restocking themselves is pretty much the only way to do this reasonably.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p><span class="bbcode-b">6. Death: What should happen, if a player dies?</span><br>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">6.3 Should all players have to play the whole map again?</span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can’t even believe the 3rd idea was suggested. haven’t we learned from teh frustration of plying Decay? That is, and would be, an absolute bitch for everyone. The 2nd idea wasn’t much better, it would be an absolute bitch for the player who died. Sure it’s incentive not to die, but then there’s also no incentive to not just drop out once you’ve died. I highly recommend the first idea, where spawn points are activated throughout each map as you reach them.<br>
It would be kinda cool if you could have the respawn time actually move faster if you clicked the mouse button repeatedly. Maybe 10 - 15 seconds if you just let it sit, but only 5 - 10 seconds if you repeatedly clicked the primary mouse button. It might help alleviate the frustration if the player finds out that their frustrated clicking IS actually making the time run down faster.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>And btw: I don’t know how it is handled in other mp games, but will all the players see the dynamic shadows from another players flash light? And doesn’t it look strange, if a flash light shines from nowhere?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think dynamic lights should be affected by other players. that’s a lot of processing to handle all those different points of light. If I remember synergy correctly, they didn’t even show the actual spot of light from other player’s flashlights, they simply made players who had their flashlight on show up with a short area all around them slightly brighter.</p>
