    <title>FPS drop when zooming in with the Crossbow</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fps-drop-when-zooming-in-with-the-crossbow/10241</link>
    <description>When zooming in with the crossbow, the game produces a circle in the middle of my screen that is zoomed in, super-imposed over my normal game view. This causes my system to slow down considerably and, as a result, miss a lot of my shots. It&#39;s a cool effect to look at, to be sure, but it&#39;s not cool enough to sacrifice half my FPS to.

Is it possible to include an option to instead have it work like it did in the original Half-Life? What I mean by this is, when you zoom in, you get only the scope view and the rest of the screen is black. By eliminating the need to render the world twice, I suspect my framerate should improve and allow me to make precious shots once more.</description>
