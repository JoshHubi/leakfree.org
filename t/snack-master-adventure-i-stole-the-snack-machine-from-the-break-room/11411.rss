    <title>Snack Master Adventure! &quot;I stole the Snack Machine from the break room.&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/snack-master-adventure-i-stole-the-snack-machine-from-the-break-room/11411</link>
    <description>This is something funny/bizarre I did in the test labs when I was bored. I wanted to do some &quot;experiments&quot; in the test labs and see what kind of stuff could be done without cheats.
 I remember the security guard from the break room after I blew up the microwave casserole &quot;You think you can fix the vending machine too? College boy?&quot;. The snack machine didn&#39;t do anything when I pressed it, but I noticed that it shifted a little bit when I bumped into it. Now I realize that it&#39;s a physics prop for some reason, and start going crazy by trying to move it.

   I started wedging chairs behind the machine and jumped on them trying to move it away from the wall, eventually the machine flipped over like in the classic &quot;do not rock or tilt&quot; warning.
   It was a bit odd how no one minded that I just overturned the snack machine or that I was trying to squash someone with it, which is what I originally wanted to find out, up until noticing that the machine was easy to push when it was on the ground, so now I tried getting the machine out of the corner while keeping it upright.

And so one started pushing Snack Master along for no reason other than it was an absurd scene of Gordon pushing the snack machine through the labs...

After managing to get it in and out of the elevator, there was suddenly a goal to get it all the way downstairs to the Anti mass Spectrometer test chamber. A few scientist walking by stared at this snack machine standing in the middle of the hallway and walked past like it was only a somewhat interesting feature.

While pushing the snack machine through the control room, one of the scientist said something ironic along the lines of &quot;anyone else getting hungry?&quot;

   At last the world weary Snack Master snack machine got down to the test lab chamber lock after a trivial and convoluted journey through the halls of sector C test labs. It took a lot longer than these screenshots make it seem!

 At the doors for some reason neither the snack machine nor any other prop was able to pass through, turns out an invisible phys box was preventing the player from taking things into the test chamber. It seemed like so close yet so far, but in the developer console I typed &quot;ent remove func_physbox(func_physbox)&quot; which deleted the invisible wall and allowed props to pass through into the test chamber. That may be considered cheating, but it was an invisible wall that defied the laws of physics, something that Gordon Freeman Ph.D would not agree with!

Getting over the bulkhead door and into the test chamber was the last obstacle. It was time to give The Snack Master a Viking funeral by being a test sample in the anti mass spectrometer.

Standard insertion, for a Nonstandard specimen...


Even though there was no achievement for getting a giant, bulky snack machine from the break room to the test chamber, it was still hilarious to me that this was even possible to do! All this from wanting to see what is possible to do ingame and what ridiculous things can be done. Pushing this clunky snack machine made me slow down and thus let me admire all the detail that was put into the test labs as well as the work put into Black Mesa!..</description>

            <p>This is something funny/bizarre I did in the test labs when I was bored. I wanted to do some “experiments” in the test labs and see what kind of stuff could be done without cheats.<br>
I remember the security guard from the break room after I blew up the microwave casserole “You think you can fix the vending machine too? College boy?”. The snack machine didn’t do anything when I pressed it, but I noticed that it shifted a little bit when I bumped into it. Now I realize that it’s a physics prop for some reason, and start going crazy by trying to move it.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>I started wedging chairs behind the machine and jumped on them trying to move it away from the wall, eventually the machine flipped over like in the classic “do not rock or tilt” warning.<br>
It was a bit odd how no one minded that I just overturned the snack machine or that I was trying to squash someone with it, which is what I originally wanted to find out, up until noticing that the machine was easy to push when it was on the ground, so now I tried getting the machine out of the corner while keeping it upright.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>And so one started pushing Snack Master along for no reason other than it was an absurd scene of Gordon pushing the snack machine through the labs…<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>After managing to get it in and out of the elevator, there was suddenly a goal to get it all the way downstairs to the Anti mass Spectrometer test chamber. A few scientist walking by stared at this snack machine standing in the middle of the hallway and walked past like it was only a somewhat interesting feature.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>While pushing the snack machine through the control room, one of the scientist said something ironic along the lines of “anyone else getting hungry?”</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>At last the world weary Snack Master snack machine got down to the test lab chamber lock after a trivial and convoluted journey through the halls of sector C test labs. It took a lot longer than these screenshots make it seem!</p>
<p>At the doors for some reason neither the snack machine nor any other prop was able to pass through, turns out an invisible phys box was preventing the player from taking things into the test chamber. It seemed like so close yet so far, but in the developer console I typed “ent remove func_physbox(func_physbox)” which deleted the invisible wall and allowed props to pass through into the test chamber. That may be considered cheating, but it was an invisible wall that defied the laws of physics, something that Gordon Freeman Ph.D would not agree with!</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Getting over the bulkhead door and into the test chamber was the last obstacle. It was time to give The Snack Master a Viking funeral by being a test sample in the anti mass spectrometer.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
Standard insertion, for a Nonstandard specimen…</p>
<p>Even though there was no achievement for getting a giant, bulky snack machine from the break room to the test chamber, it was still hilarious to me that this was even possible to do! All this from wanting to see what is possible to do ingame and what ridiculous things can be done. Pushing this clunky snack machine made me slow down and thus let me admire all the detail that was put into the test labs as well as the work put into Black Mesa!..</p>
