    <title>Portal Mapping Trouble</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portal-mapping-trouble/492</link>
    <description>Well. Once again another question from me. And once again i&#39;m begging for a solution. 

Recently I&#39;ve been trying to set up the Hammer Editor for mapping with Portal. Now I&#39;d thought it would be easy like the rest of the games I&#39;ve configured. But no, just no. I do all the usual stuff required to setting up a new game into the editor.=(Game config, Build Programs, ect.) but it shows up with a weird buggy non working hammer screen. It is the regular hammer screen but the 4 views are just black, with a couple of bold white lines and when I load the Valve example map, the &#39;camera&#39; view just turns white.

Anybody know how I could fix this? Is more info and screenshots required? Thanks to anyone who helps.</description>

            <p>When you have Portal installed <span class="bbcode-b">(when its an illegal verion it can’t work)</span> just click on the button <span class="bbcode-b">“Reset Game Configuration”</span>… then SDK will configure the P[COLOR=‘DeepSkyBlue’]0[/SIZE]RTAL editor itself… then just go to <span class="bbcode-b">ENGINE VERSION: The Orange Box</span> and choose P[COLOR=‘DarkOrange’]0[/SIZE]RTAL… when its still dont work click <span class="bbcode-b">“Refresh SDK Content”</span>… so it will refresh your files…</p>

            <p>Did you set up Source SDK <span class="bbcode-b">correctly</span> for it?</p>
<p>Settings in SDK should be set to:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Engine version: Orange Box<br>
Current Game: Portal</span></p>
<p>That’s all you have to do…</p>
<p>If you did do it correctly, check if you can load models and textures from portal… Some screenshots would be helpful… but it sounds like you’ve just set up SDK weirdly.</p>
<p>Any mapping for source games should be done in SDK using the latest version of hammer… just in case you are using some old version of hammer…</p>
