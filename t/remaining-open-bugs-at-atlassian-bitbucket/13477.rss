    <title>Remaining &quot;Open&quot; Bugs at Atlassian Bitbucket</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/remaining-open-bugs-at-atlassian-bitbucket/13477</link>
    <description>There are still a large number of community reported game bugs, some of them quite old, that are still classified as &quot;Open&quot; at the Atlassian Bitbucket website. Just wondering if and when these will be resolved or reclassified to an alternate category/status.</description>

            <p>It’s low on my priority list right now. At some point I will likely go through what remains to weed out what might still be relevant.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t read into it. I haven’t been watching the tracker, but there could be a bunch of reasons. Maybe they have a new one (think they expressed wanting an internal one at some point).</p>

            <p>There are also a lot of ‘new’ bugs that are untouched either. Probably devs are busy with something else, and will resolve bugs once other changes are made, which can creature new bugs.<br>
Also, there is one bug marked as ‘closed’ instead of ‘resolved’ and it seems to be the last resolved one - maybe that means something?</p>
