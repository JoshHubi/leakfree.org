    <description>O.k. I really want this mod. I have never played any half-life game and I really want to play this , however, when I go to download it it shows a timer saying I have to wait 1,458,117,673 seconds. To put that in perspective that equals out to 47.06 years. I need to know if this is a recurring problem or what. I tried every link including torrent and they all give me that timer saying the same amount of time.</description>
