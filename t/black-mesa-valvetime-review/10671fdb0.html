          <p>Two things to keep in mind about BM, that for some reason people seem to miss.<br>
One, developers of a mod (for more than 7 years) recreating the entire original Half Life are themselves very devoted Half Life fans.<br>
Two, (in general) developing a mod (even a whole lot smaller one) on your spare time for years is not a process which is uncorrelated with the fan base of the mod. In fact, the fan base is sometimes the only/main reason you keep on working on and improving your work, after the initial enthusiasm has faded out.</p>
<p>To see a mod, which is a complete game, achieve the high quality standards that BM has, is unprecedented in the modding community as far as I know (and I have been involved in the modding scene)</p>
<p>So it is sad that in the end petty grudges or thought process of  “screw the positive feedback, I want to be objective (and controversial) !!11one” are considered the correct ways to comment on the work of these developers.</p>

<p>The HECU voices in HL1 were covered with more static and sounded a bit more mature, but the voices in BM still sound pretty faithful.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ehm, HECUs in HL1 sounded like coordinated, machine-like group of army specialists. Heck even the dreaded ‘only. say. one. word. at. a. time.’ lent to the proverbial ‘military precision’ badassery.<br>
In BM, they sound… a bit anxious and insecure bunch of hired guns, for a lack of the better characterization?</p>
<p>HL used ‘SEMPER. FI. MOTHER. FUCKER.’ stereotype - BM resorted to ‘young b-movie merc thug’ stereotype.<br>
I happen to strongly favor the former as it was one of my fondest memories of HL.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Which is it though? Was the voice work remade or re imagined? I’m not a fan of inconsistency myself, it can fracture the global front you want to make with a game. In this case they did both and it caused such a rift.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ll just say it felt inappropriate to chose a direction like this for HECUs. Sure, a good idea when on paper - I could even get behind it - but in the end it felt like simply swapping one character stereotype for another.<br>
It’s clearly the dev’s decision though and they have every right to stick to it.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>As for the BM voice acting, they made an astonishing work, even for the HECU.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, no doubt about the voice actors doing great work. VA direction, however - is an entirely different thing.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Just compare it to HL1: aside the poor quality of sound (yeah, it is 90’s game), you cant understand the hecu voices… Their voices seem like robots.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I still insist that it was a part of the charm. And as I’m currently working on compiling my own phrases from original HECU voices - I can responsibly assure that the sounds are <em>very</em> clear.<br>
But as stated above - it’s not the quality or production values that I object against - it is rather the direction that was taken.</p>

          <p>I actually kind of like one or 2 of the HECU’s line delivery, like when they say “WERE GONNA KICK-YOUR-ASS” but for the most part I agree, it was really inappropriate, and sometimes they would say something and it would sound like a bad Christian Bale batman impression.</p>
<p>I actually think the <span class="bbcode-i">medics</span> have better sounding voices then the gruff ones. They aren’t as deep-voiced and still aren’t as good as the HL1 voices, but the line delivery is better then the “gruff” guys.</p>
<p>Plus sometimes it’s just bad, like “I killed 12 dumbass scientists today, and not one of em fought back!” sounded like he was saying that while someone rammed a drill up his ass.</p>

I will admit it was a good moment to educate people on the Allies. There are admittedly times when I forget that I’ve been playing Half-Life games for literally over a decade now and that not everyone understands that. I personally feel that the Barney scene of him shooting the zombies when you ascend that elevator to be enough. At least there was a purpose though, so I will give it that.</p>

I have a feeling you might be in the 75% and I really appreciate the sentiment. Thank you.</p>

I should have mentioned it in the review but the Ambient noises WERE quite good. I rarely ever thought about them which is pretty much spot on for how ambience should be designed.</p>
<p>I also can’t say enough that I fully believe the VA talent did their absolute best, but that they weren’t quite provided with the direction needed. Black Mesa should either have been a recreation where stilted and silly dialogue would be nostalgic, or a true re-imagining where they could really have had fun with the vocals and busted out the talent I know for a fact their VA team has.</p>

That Bee/Portal bug really threw me for a loop. I almost launched myself off the rotating platform down into the shaft in confusion. There were a few other ugs, largely involving skipping sections with barrel towers which I wasn’t sure if was supposed to be allowed or not. It was as if grabbing objects was added as an afterthought. In the end barrel hops let me bypass enemy encounters as their spawns would not trigger.</p>
<p>Refusing to use the Tram in on a rail appears to have a similar effect where certain things just don’t appear to happen.</p>

I would like to address this. First off Bloodshot I’ve lurked around the forums a bit before. Not surprisingly I was keeping an eye on things a bit after the leak situation out of curiosity. You’re clearly an ardent fan and I really hope it doesn’t come off as sarcastic that you are the kind of fan any project deserves. Dedicated and passionate. Just remember that just as the users of Valvetime will reflect upon those that write for the site, that you as a committed member reflect upon the Black Mesa team. Be the fan they deserve. Take you fire and love for a very long project and turn it towards improving the community, in any way you can or desire. Projects like Black Mesa need Citizens more than it will ever need Warriors.</p>

<p>Thanks for the kind words. Most of my anger I portrayed was partially because I still liked watching VT videos and the review left me baffled, especially since it was given a recommendation, when the review didn’t actually provide much reason as to why you would recommend it after all the bad points you had mentioned, and that the whole review seemed like it was based on more disappointment from expectation to be an exact HL1 in source rather then taking the mod at face value. I do fanboy a lot for certain things, but I usually have a good reason for reacting in a fanboy way when I do.</p>

          <p>I believe that there were more bad points brought out than good points, I spent a good 10 hours on the MOD and i have well more good things to say then bad, they focused on the bad, if this review lasted for another 10 minutes explaining all the good things and then the bad maybe we wouldnt believe this is such a biased review. You guys put little effort into saying a good word. They are a MOD team separated by oceans, borders and yet they managed to pull off such an amazing experience with no funding!</p>

Goodnight to all, and thank you for watching the review even if you didn’t like it, and I hope you’ll trust me when I say that the discussion so far has been far more entertaining, interesting, and educating than most I’ve had for a long time. Hopefully, we over at Valvetime will take things we learn here to improve going forward. At least I will anyway.</p>

<p>As for the recommendation and review. Black Mesa absolutely deserves to be played, but it is good enough to deserve to be judged as I would any other game, is how I took our review. When you remake a game such as Half-Life there is an inherent bar you are trying to reach. Black Mesa in trying to replicate the quality and success of Half-Life 1 merely left me, personally, with the desire to play the real thing. I’m not an ardent die hard fan of the original either. One of the best games I have played? Yes. But it is not impossible for a recreation to have properly scratched that itch. I felt in the end that alterations from the existing game where detrimental, while parts that stayed true to the original were excellent. I was going to ramble on more, but that is the angle from which we reviewed Black Mesa, and angle that we felt is set by the very fact that it is what it is.</p>

I don’t want to repeat too much but just wanted to let you know I’m not skipping the Favored bad over good tone of the review. I mention it in my last post I believe. For performance I’ve heard of wildly varying experiences, from one crash such as yourself to so many that people give up for the night. Though they do return later. I myself suffered 3 in my play through.</p>
<p>For the music, I was unable to go into the detail I wanted. The music is VERY well done. It’s done by a clearly talented artist and he should be and I hope is proud of his work. Hell I am struggling to record a single singer/songwriter friend, so I have some insight to music production. My problem more lay in the direction the music took gameplay, or how the music itself was utilized or implemented in the mod. Sometimes songs would play too early. Or a song would trigger separate from an event. So the song is rocking along while I stand still waiting for an attack that never comes until I begin moving again. I also feel that the music was not properly directed. Perhaps the music was guided in a hands on way by a lead developer, I can not say. I felt, however, that in updating the music a lot of the charm and simpler musical atmosphere was lost from Half-Life while not quite adding enough to justify the change. In Half-Life the music felt more a part of the game and design something to augment the experience. In Black Mesa it felt much more aggressive and guiding, like it was telling me I was doing something wrong if I was not blasting a million soldiers to bits.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/jeannotvb-2.html">@Jeannotvb</a><br>
“I find myself agreeing with some points in the review, but nothing serious enough to lower my personal rating for the game.”</p>
<p>No lie, THIS is why I review games. This is exactly what I was hoping for and even said as much in discussion about whether we post the review or not. I don’t want to change people’s minds, to prove people wrong. But if someone thinks about something and is at least willing to entertain the idea that another view might be right, then even if they ultimately reject my opinions then I am more than happy. Maybe even more so because how strong can my or anyone else’s opinion be if we can not let it stand up to the challenge of others?</p>

<p>That’s pure demagogy - no one has tried to undermine the tremendous achievement. It is fairly pointless to raise a point as to whether it is an achievement or not since it is self-explanatory.</p>

</aside>
<p>You are right I admit that I just would have liked to see some more good points raised in the video to make it less harsh. I agree with a few points in the video because they are true il never lie and say the mod is perfect because it isnt and nothing ever is perfect. A review is to show an overall experience not to show all the flaws and little of the good in my honest opinion! Sorry its late and im kind of throwing things out there without really thinking them over I am no longer posting in this thread because it just seems pointless to continue!</p>

          <p>This review does brings up some very good points. Of course, it also brings up a bunch of stuff that I don’t really agree with, such as 2 dimensional characters. I thought the main characters had plenty of depth, and the random side characters didn’t need any (and then even they got some character development at times, like the guy talking about Barney’s bar tap, or the guy making the Predator reference).</p>
<p>From what I have seen from the reaction to this (and some others) review, especially from youtube, it seems that any time someone says anything bad about the game they seem to get instantly flamed, followed by the conspiracy theories being rolled out, such as them having an agenda or just being mad because the game wasn’t like CoD, or something…anything. I very much enjoyed the mod but there are definitely some problems with the mod, such as the voice work, the bugs, and a few other things. For everything I found myself agreeing with in the video, I found myself disagreeing with something too.</p>
<p>I can understand the performance issues people are having. My experience of Black Mesa was perfect. The odd bug here and there, but no crashes (the game has literally never crashed for me) but I know someone who is having nothing but constant crashes. I hope these performance issues get fixed pronto, because they really can be a showstopper at times.</p>

<p>For the music, I was unable to go into the detail I wanted. The music is VERY well done. It’s done by a clearly talented artist and he should be and I hope is proud of his work. Hell I am struggling to record a single singer/songwriter friend, so I have some insight to music production. My problem more lay in the direction the music took gameplay, or how the music itself was utilized or implemented in the mod. Sometimes songs would play too early. Or a song would trigger separate from an event. So the song is rocking along while I stand still waiting for an attack that never comes until I begin moving again. I also feel that the music was not properly directed. Perhaps the music was guided in a hands on way by a lead developer, I can not say. I felt, however, that in updating the music a lot of the charm and simpler musical atmosphere was lost from Half-Life while not quite adding enough to justify the change. In Half-Life the music felt more a part of the game and design something to augment the experience. In Black Mesa it felt much more aggressive and guiding, like it was telling me I was doing something wrong if I was not blasting a million soldiers to bits.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I found this a little bit, but mostly the music was solid. It worked great ~90% of the time, so I can’t really complain. There was once or twice where I got the most intense elevator music ever, but other than that it worked wonderfully</p>
<p>I think the way to make the music work better would be to set up a system similar to the one that was used for the garg battle in ST, where it played a small loop of soft buildup until you got outside, THEN triggered the heavy stuff. That could have been used amazingly well in chapters like We’ve Got Hostiles, or Questionable Ethics.</p>
<p>TL;DR Black Mesa is far from perfect, but this review seemed at best a little unfair</p>

          <p>So, I’m back. I had an account here for ages, but then the data crash happened, and I never bothered to renew. But, very long time lurker and reader, but now, first time poster.</p>
<p>I just finished playing through the mod. I have to say, it was way better than I was expecting.</p>
<p>The Valvetime review did have a few things that i agree with, which I will list.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Crashes to desktop - Happened at least five or six times in random areas, and I’m on a good computer. No idea what’s happening, but was annoyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the crowbar - Introduced a bit later than I wanted. I liked the flares sequence, but then you guys didn’t do much with them beyond the initial sequence. I wanted a bit more. I think the crowbar should have been added maybe a tad earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Crowbar animation was good, but could have been better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other random bugs were somewhat frustrating, but I can’t remember some of them off the top of my head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes the music was WAY too loud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, it was hard to see where you had to go. Now, I’ve played HL1 many times, but even then, I wasn’t 100% sure in a few areas (like Lambda core reactors, it was a bit confusing at first). In all honesty, this was MUCH more realistic, since it would be a complex area, but just a smidge derdly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the weapons didn’t feel as useful. The 357 Ironsight wasn’t useful, the MP5 didn’t have enough recoil, and the crowbar animation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, with that out of the way, what I loved.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your environmental artistry was fantastic. Prop placement, level design, texturing, modeling, voice acting, animation, etc. All of the technical work was excellent. As in, better than Valve, almost. Everything felt right. I can tell you guys did a lot of sample work looking at real source images, since nothing felt out of place. You created a believable world, and I tip my hate to you on that. I want your textures and models for my own use, in all honesty, but in a way I don’t because I won’t be able to do justice to your quality of work. You have given me incentive to improve my creation of believability in architecture and propping, though. Love it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The story progressed the way Half Life did, and the action was where it was before. It progressed the same while removing some of the annoying crap HL1 had that didn’t need to be there. Thank you very much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The characters were believable, I thought. I wasn’t expecting Hollywood acting, and the stuff those actors put into their characters was very good. I wished the soldiers were a bit more endearing, though. I’d have no trouble murdering them, but I also expect them to be human.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Overall, BMS is one of the best games I’ve played thusfar, nevermind mods. It brought back a lot of good memories, even though you had a few flaws. You’re definitely up there in my favourites, and i’ll give it a reply for sure. I gave the original Half Life a 98/100 for my personal score; Zelda OoT was 96. The rest of the Half Life series was definitely a 94. I’d give you guys a 92. It was superb. The 8 year wait didn’t matter. Love was going into this. Time. Detail. I work in Hammer a lot casually, and I know how long it takes to produce basic things, nevermind masterpieces. The wait was part of the experience. Would I have loved for it to come out five years ago? Sure, but then it would not have been this.</p>
<p>Overall, thank you for making this. This is how I’ve imagined HL in my mind, and you’ve made it feel right and made it a legitimate thing. Thank you very much for producing something of excellent quality.</p>

          <p>Some legitimate negative observations in the review…yeah, there’s an agenda (which seems mysterious to someone, like me, who doesn’t know the backstory of the conflict between the two communities and is too aloof to investigate) but I don’t feel strongly about it.</p>
<p>While I’m here, I give Black Mesa perfect marks. As an AAA game (in some strange alternate universe?) I’d only be slightly harsher. As a free modification with a budget of ‘zero-dollars-and-lots-of-love-and-time’, it’s not only a classic, but also faintly inspiring. This will be played for a long time.</p>

I have to ask that you not equate the of opinion of the Valvetime community forums with the opinions of the Valvetime staff. Or vice versa, honestly. Not really fair to either of us. There are some writer comments in there.</p>
<p>And looking I actually see my post in there, but I’m not going to back peddle. If people want to, they can find it or link it. I was not out to get Black Mesa though. As silly as it is, I try to take my personal integrity seriously. Which I admit working for a video game site is pretty absurd. I do my best to set aside any feelings as I can. Had this been made by different people, with a different shared history, I’d have still felt the same. I work to being able to say that, and it is not always easy, not am I infallible.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You were ready to bad-mouth Black Mesa before it had even been released. Admitting to it doesn’t change the fact that you have a very clear bias in this situation, fuelled by some embarrassingly petty grudge.</p>

You are correct that we gloss over the more positive points. It could have been expressed better. In my eyes the review begins as “Yes, the mod is beautiful, we all know this. There’s more to it though so let’s cut to the chase.” Because it is. <span class="bbcode-b">Black Mesa is a very attractive game. There is astonishing talent behind it.</span> Which is all the more disappointing for me that I did not find myself enjoying it as much as the content producers deserved.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Please stop this. This utterly transparent faux-praise for the visuals so that you can appear to be remaining level-headed and objective, and which quite obviously stages your frankly meek, painfully condescending “it’s pretty but everything else is terrible” argument is really becoming tiresome.</p>

<p>Also, I totally get where people are coming from. I feel some are going a little too far, but the sentiment is completely understandable. We actually had to have a discussion about whether to post the review. Do we give a more positive review despite our feelings in order to prevent damage to people’s perception of us? Or do we go with how we feel and weather any storm should it come as best we can? I stand by our choice, and we knew that there was a chance for backlash.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think it’s quite clear how that discussion went and am completely unsurprised that you stick to your guns. You’re getting the reaction you’d hoped for, after all. Controversy for controversy’s sake, and in the end it will only reflect poorly on you.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Note: I’m not defending Black Mesa here - I have my fair share of legitimate complaints. I’m attacking the piss-poor review from attention-seeking writers whose sole intention was to provoke their readers and the Devs, who they’ve clearly not forgiven for hurting their feelings, rather than actually reviewing the game.</span></p>
<p>That’s all I have to say on the matter, and I hardly expect you to accept what I’ve said, but I don’t think you’re fooling anyone.</p>

<p>I agree with the score (none of the hl games would score high these days), but you’d have thought if they played it the jumping would have been mentioned (and the wrong walkers crisp packets for time).
