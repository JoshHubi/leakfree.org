<blockquote>
<p>‘Valve Time’ is a term people use to describe the way Valve releases their games. For example, when Valve says a game is released next month, this actually means the game will be released in three months (“Valve Time”). The same with Episode 3, they told us the episodes would be released within three months of eachother, but it’s been over 5 years now since Episode 2.</p>
<p>So yeah, the community website is simply named ‘ValveTime’, but it has no affiliations to Valve itself.</p>

<p>It had limited ammo.  I know it could one hit kill a lot of enemies but using just it would sap your ammo if you didn’t switch guns…at least that is what I experienced.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s not been my experience. I used the Magnum liberally throughout my playthrough. Not exclusively, mind you, but at no point did I try to conserve ammo. I was still having to skip boxes of Magnum ammo all over the place. I think a lot has to do with how much ammo each box holds. In the original Half-Life and in Half-Life 2, a single box of ammo holds 6 rounds, or one drum’s worth. A box in Black Mesa holds 12 - double the ammo. I don’t believe there are fewer boxes of Magnum ammo in Black Mesa than there were in Half-Life. If anything, I seem to come across them more often. And with double the ammo in them AND the lower maximal ammo pool…</p>
<p>Put it like this - towards mid-to-late game, I was killing Barnacles with the Magnum just so I’d make a dent in my ammo count and pick up those boxes I was missing.</p>
<p>The Magnum was always a very, very powerful weapon. It was just as enticing, if not more so since HL1 soldiers tend to not run around as much. But ammo was always limited. Sure, the gun held 36 spare rounds, but start using those and you’ll drain them FAST, and the game simply didn’t offer to replenish them nearly enough to keep up.</p>
<hr>
<p>As for the “like/dislike” ration of the review - I’m not saying there aren’t reasons to dislike the review. I’m saying that its YouTube rating really isn’t indicative of quality so much as it is of hype and group think. Look at the video for anything popular and you’ll always see a good dozen dislikes. Normal, yes, but then commenters will proceed to post things like “12 people have no taste!” or “12 people are gay!” or “12 people should be shot in their sleep!”</p>
<p>YouTube likes measures of popularity are about on par with Survivor or Big Brother or American Idol votes of popularity, is what I’m saying. Judge the review on its own merits, and if you don’t like it based on those, then that’s just fine.</p>

            <p>Hey I’m a newsposter for Valvetime. I wasn’t involved in making the video review in any way (and I’m not here in any official capacity) but I’m glad there’s some proper discussion happening here about it instead of just a childish flame war. Thanks for that James. The Youtube comments are almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>Also hi Smash, hi Kupo.</p>

<p>If I had one complaint about Black Mesa that really can’t be looked past is that it does, indeed, feel like a modern military shooter. Too many fights with too difficult soldiers and not enough fights with aliens</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because it makes sense that there are so many soldiers. The facility is overrun with aliens and that’s practically all you see in the start before the military takes over the whole facility and pretty much begin killing everything in there.<br>
You get topside only to see the military everywhere trying to take care of the disaster. After that you get near the Lambda Complex and what do you see? No military, only assassins, scientists and aliens.</p>

<p>Actually, back when Half life was released, it was the most realistic Fps you could get in the market. We are talking about an era where shooters were either gray shooter galleries with floating weapons like Quake or colorfull tongue in cheek parodies like Duke Nukem. If anything half life started the trend of realistic shooters.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Up to a point, however. Half-Life didn’t focus so much on how real war would be fought as on mixing some degree of realism and some degree of sci-fi. Remember, many of your enemies are armoured aliens and a good half of your arsenal comprises organic or impossible weapons. That’s more or less what I’m saying - it played with more realism than everything at the time, but it still played fast-and-loose with its combat to where it wasn’t specifically “real.”</p>
<p>I get that fights against the Marines aren’t supposed to be won by tanking their fire, bum-rushing their lines and gunning them down… But that’s how it ends up playing out for me. Because it’s next to impossible to not take large amounts of fire on account of their accuracy and to take shots without suffering return fire on account of their reaction times, the most effective way often seems to be to let them shoot me long enough to line up a shot and take them down. I’m tanking their damage, sure, but I take more if I try to hide from it.</p>

</aside>
<p>I try not to, certainly, but the Magnum is so effective it’s difficult to resist a lot of the time. To be fair, I just played through Half-Life, Opposing Force and Blue Shift, and the Magnum is just as effective and enticing there, as well. I mentioned elsewhere about a skirmish in Blue Shift that put me against something like 18 Marines in four waves, and I did a lot of that with the Magnum, just because I was under such pressure I ignored my compunctions to “pretty” combat.</p>

</aside>
<p>I beat the Questionable Ethics fight on Hard not too long ago. It was surprisingly much easier than I had anticipated. I went in with around 80 HP and no more than 30 HEV, and it only took me around 5-6 reloads - fewer than my Normal playthrough, even. I’m not exactly the best FPS player around, either. I love the Marine fights on Hard, they feel just right to me. And though this is at first a really difficult fight, if you stop and think about what you’re going to do, and then execute it well, that’s really all there is to it and in the end, it’s not too difficult.</p>

<p>I doubt their intention was to create Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Half-Life. There’s a reason Half-Life remains a classic to this day, and part of it is that it DOESN’T conform to the rules of modern realistic tactical military shooters. If I had one complaint about Black Mesa that really can’t be looked past is that it does, indeed, feel like a modern military shooter. Too many fights with too difficult soldiers and not enough fights with aliens.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually, back when Half life was released, it was the most realistic Fps you could get in the market. We are talking about an era where shooters were either gray shooter galleries with floating weapons like Quake or colorfull tongue in cheek parodies like Duke Nukem. If anything half life started the trend of realistic shooters.</p>

<p>A 9.0 score is a fantastic score for a mod. I know that you are comparing it with your review score of the original, but it’s still a great score on its own.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is.  I throughly enjoyed the game.  The comparision I made though was how I felt as I played it vs how I felt when I played the orignal.  Playing the orignal back in 1998 when it was new felt slightly better than this does but I attribute it to the fact that I already knew the story.  What caused me to give it .3 points less than the orignal is that I noticed the flow of the story seemed faster than the orignal and the fact that when I heard report of how the HECU were pulling out I thought to myself wait why pull out your winning.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You weren’t supposed to run around like Rambo in the first game swinging your crowbar around.  I think you are confused here.  HL1 was unbalanced more than BM is in my opinion.  Heck, if I have to hear one more time that the crowbar doesn’t do anything, I am going to buy one myself and use it.  The Devs designed the game so that certain weapons were better suited for certain enemies, not for ONE weapon to be overpowered and have tons of ammo so that you can be RAMBO.  That is RUN AND SHOOT.  This is Gordon Freeman…which means you RUN. SHOOT. THINK. LIVE. ETC.  Many players have said many things are fine if you use them correctly.  There are some things that seem universally across the board as needing tweaked.  I have heard the same people complaining about the same things in every thread.  If I could run through this game killing 50% of the enemies with a crowbar…then what does that prove? It is overpowered? If it can effectively kill 2-3 types of enemies then that seems to have done rather well.  I have seen people use the mp5 wonderfully, I have seen the pistol be used in the clutch.  If some people can hit the head and the enemy dies faster, then…aim for the head?</p>
<p>The keyword in all of this ranting is “THINK!”[/SIZE]</p>
<p>I don’t play a game on the hardest difficulties first.  Oddly enough, I start at easy so that I can get adjusted to controls, weapons, enemies, aiming, etc.  Then I move to the harder difficulties.  I have seen people run into this game on hard and fight through it…I have seen people run into this game on easy and struggle.  It is not always easy for everyone.  I played on normal and felt pretty challenged.  I used all of my weapons unlike HL1 where I used the mp5 and shotgun most of it.  I am sorry if I seem like I am coming across like a dickhead but I am just trying to show that the game has a learning curve that many players aren’t respecting and are getting punished for it.  There are players who play every game on hard and breeze through it.  There are players who play many games on easy and barely make it through.  Hell, I can’t remember the last time I played a game on hard without using cheats halfway through.  Will I do it with this one? Doubt it from what I have heard from others.  I am not a master player so I tend to stick to what is fun and exciting.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>No offence to you John Rossy, but here is a bit of critique to your review. Not the opinion expressed in it, only on what I feel is creating a different message than what you say that you want to convey.</p>
<p>The problem here isn’t that the you are wrong, everyone is entitled to their opinion. Frankly, the problem to me was that the review was poorly made. A good review takes up both the good and the bad points of the game, and besides for a few quick positive glance-overs, your review did not portray anything positive about the game. As others have stated, this video was a critique, <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> a review.<br>
If you, the reviewer, want to convey that you liked the game, you should have devoted a part of the video for conveying this to the viewer. If you feel that you cannot fit your opinions on a certain ammount of time (as you have said in this thread) then you should either not publish, or devote more time or space to the review, simple as that.</p>
<p>This video seems like obvious flaimbait to me. The fact that you are here, politely taking the debate with us is a great gesture, and it makes me less inclined to think it actually was made for flame-bait, but I am not entirely convinced. If the review was double the lengt, using the same ammount of time on the positive sides of the game, I think a lot of people would like the review a whole lot more, and you would have conveyed everything you did, while not looking like a complete jerk, like you do in your video now.</p>
<p>Also, I think that recording a review when you have not slept for that long is a really dumb idea.</p>

<p>If you stay at that point, you will be able to hear the scientist banging on the door and shouting “oh god, they set a trap for him”. The music will build all the way until the beat kicks in, at which point they will rappel down automatically, the scientist is SUPPOSED to be drowned out at this point and doesn’t say anything else of interest. So no, it doesnt stop the mod progressing, I designed that whole section to be timed to the music if you wanted to hear the choreography, or just kick straight into the action with a trigger at the top of the stairs.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Drowning the scientist’s audio out really works, it contributed to the build up. But I think making him inaudible is a mistake; I stayed down in the blast door ramp so I was able to hear him, and it really gave me a <em>stand back little scientist man, I got this</em> feel as the music and action crashed in. I hate to know that some players missed out on this because they went deeper into the room.</p>
<p>You guys should also look at the music volume throughout the entire game. Sometimes it’s so loud that not only does it cover up SFX and dialogue, but it becomes dramatically inappropriate for places where the music needs to be more subtle, non-action segments being the best example.</p>

<p>I guarantee this room was very heavily planned and tested, I’ve worked on the idea for this lobby fight since 2007, and it has undergone many months of iterative testing with the direct intension of NOT being a run and gun section. If you try to blast your way through it like Arnie in Commando, you will die really very fast. Run. Shoot. THINK…</p>
<p>It is certainly hard, but I designed and tested it with hard difficulty on. The HECU are perhaps a bit fast reaction wise, but they are easily beatable in the lobby if you use a combination of the weapons you have, make sure that you use the chargers before you enter, consider using the weapon that the chapter gives you to play with first, and take note of the enviroment around you for weapons that might be a hint on how to beat the fight.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In my play experience - make that several experiences, I failed to win the fight several times on normal difficulty. I went in with high health, power, and ample ammunition. I still failed every single attempt that I left the door ramp to use even the smallest portion of the room as a play area. The desk and boxes were cover for the grunts, not me.</p>
<p>Slowing reaction time with convars greatly improved the situation into something that sounds like the same game you designed.

In the original half-life I was accustomed to changing position/angle-of-attack and had a good time doing so.</p>
<p>Off topic, but while you brushed the subject I think it’s important enough to get my voice out.</p>
