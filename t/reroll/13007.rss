            <p>I do wish the <em>game</em> part of the game wasn’t top-down. The Earth is awesome, give me a freely rotating camera.</p>
<p>Of course, if they did that, it would be impossible to use all of that data and stream it with good draw distance without a server farm.</p>
<p>Even so, it sounds like top-down DayZ with geographic data, which is a waste of the potential. They should stand apart and do something new with the map design. Maybe a sci fi Oregon Trail or something. I’d totally make that game.</p>

<p>Oh, well that makes sense. Where is that? I don’t see like an FAQ or anything.</p>
<p>EDIT: Nvm I’m blind.</p>
<p>So it is a bit more reasonable than it seems at first. It’s definitely interesting but I think I’ll just watch and see what happens. I’m not dying to play a game like this, but the real world mapping data is interesting. Wonder if they could maybe make that data available to other companies or modders to use in other games.</p>

            <p>For a minute there I thought someone was making an open-world sandbox game with scanned countries and the setting or something.</p>
<p>So it’s a basic-looking RPG with the selling point being that they scanned the Earth for a background with wasted detail? Shame.</p>
