    <title>All of the models and animations were great...except the mp5</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/all-of-the-models-and-animations-were-great-except-the-mp5/10479</link>
    <description>What happened? Who approved that? I think it really takes away from the game, seeing as it&#39;s practically the main weapon. 

The model appears of lower quality than the rest of the weapons(low poly and the front sight isn&#39;t finished....)

The animation is lackluster(the dinky little charging handle moves on it&#39;s own...)

Other than that and a few quad core issues, bravo team!  :slight_smile:</description>
