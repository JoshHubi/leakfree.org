<p>Okay, I’ll bite - but you better sit down for this:</p>
<p>I think it sucked.  The story is boring and to be honest, not very funny.  Even though it seems to be aimed at humor, I honestly couldn’t laugh.  The acting is just plain bad.  See how it takes 5 seconds for this person to react when she gets hit by an arrow in the neck?  Also, note how she gets hit from the side, when she’s almost directly looking at the person who shot her?  Come to think of it, why didn’t she see the shot coming?</p>
<p>The beach environment is ugly and the visual effects are childish.  I imagine you’re doing this to add to the humor, but all it does is send the message “look, I spent 2 minutes making this in Windows Movie Maker”.  The sound is really bad too, get a decent microphone.  Sometimes it’s hard to understand what people are saying, and the sound is hollow.  Oh, and stop being cheap and buy a fucking tripod.  The camera shakes make me dizzy.</p>
<p>Other than that, great movie.</p>
