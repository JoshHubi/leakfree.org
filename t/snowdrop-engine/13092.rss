            <p>If I’m making a game, I want to be able to spend hours actually, y’know, <span class="bbcode-i">making the game</span> rather than <span class="bbcode-i">trying to figure out why I can’t make my game</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if I’m a coder and I want to send the message “Hello, world!” to the player, I want to be able to write this in 3 seconds:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>send_msg_to_player_screen(“Hello, world!”)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Instead of writing this for 20 minutes:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>class HelloWorldMessageSender implements MessageSender {<br>
private static final String MSG_STRING = “Hello, world!”;<br>
public void SendHelloWorldMessage() throws FailedMessageException {<br>
MessageFactory msgFactory = new MessageFactory();<br>
msgFactory.putString(MSG_STRING);<br>
Message msg = msgFactory.generateNewMessageFromString();<br>
Client client = Game.getClient();<br>
MessageRenderer msgRenderer = new MessageRenderer(client.getScreen());<br>
TextObject text = msgRenderer.render();<br>
if (text != TextObject.failedTextRender &amp;&amp; text != null) {<br>
client.getScreen().pushToDisplayStack(text.toPixelArray(640, 380));<br>
}<br>
else {<br>
throw new FailedMessageException();<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>… and then spending the next six hours trying to figure out why it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>That said, the engine looks really nice! Some of it reminds me a little of CryEngine, actually (like the logical flowchart stuff). It looks easier to deal with too!</p>

<p>On the contrary, the easier an engine is to work with it, the more you can do with it, since you need to dedicate less time and energy to any one task.</p>

</aside>
<p>Plus the easier an engine is to work with, the larger the potential audience and thus more likely to get higher quality work from it. Making something difficult to use just so you can say it’s hard sounds backwards.</p>

            <p>Specialized engines work well occasionally though. UE is like the “jack of all trades master of none” engine which generally makes it easy to work with but isn’t suitable for every single game ever. Sometimes you have to make your own engine if you want your game(s) to be really good at one or a few things. And often you can’t just add that kind of stuff in on top of the engine or you get stuff like Source where its limitations are still obvious. Or even UE3 to a lesser extent.</p>

            <p>Damn that looks sexy. I really wish the game development sphere weren’t so fragmented. It’d be nice to see separate developers working together on/with the same engine. UE has been great for that, lets hope Snowdrop picks up a following too and we get less single series undeveloped engines. The part where he was making and resizing a building was really really cool. What is usually enormous quantities of work he was doing in seconds by dragging his mouse.</p>

<p>I found myself really intrigued watching the portions of the video that involved level design, because it looked so incredibly easy. I know I could make a whole lot of stuff with that kind of tools!</p>

<p>Sure, but with an engine that’s easy to work with you can allocate more time to work on the game design instead of having to deal with hours of frustration (e.g: the Source SDK).</p>
