    <title>Hand models are replaced with claws in single player</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hand-models-are-replaced-with-claws-in-single-player/14210</link>
    <description>I loaded my last save today, and my character has claws instead of Gordon&#39;s hands. I guess he&#39;s a zombie? Is there any way that I can fix this? I tried verifying the game files through steam, but it says everything is OK. I tried loading older saves with no luck.
