    <description>inb4 ep3 vs hl3 argument ensues. But seriously. Does Gordon wake up during the chopper ride or is the chopper ride part of the game intro where Gordon has to fight off some sort of flying combine like a gunship?</description>

            <p>Ok. Phew, I’m not the only one who wants to keep her alive… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I hope if they stray away from Gordon’s/Alyx’s story, they will tell a story that fits in (for example Eli/Isaac Kleiner pre-Gordon’s arrival story, maybe with the sequence where Eli loses his leg to the Bullsquid… or maybe the return of Adrian Shephard…)</p>

            <p>To be honest, I would be seriously disappointed if the next Half-Life game is what everybody could predict based on the end of the last game and the leaked concept art.  IE<br>
Crash a copter LIKE A BOSS<br>
Comfort Alyx LIKE A BOSS<br>
Fight in the snow LIKE A BOSS<br>
Find a lost ship LIKE A BOSS<br>
Fight with Combine LIKE A BOSS<br>
Travel to Xen LIKE A BOSS<br>
Kill Advisors LIKE A BOSS<br>
Blow the boat up LIKE A BOSS<br>
Talk to G-Man LIKE A BOSS<br>
Roll credits LIKE A BOSS<br>
Feel empty LIKE A BOSS<br>
Want the next game LIKE A BOSS<br>
Enter Valve Time LIKE A BOSS</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Miss the point LIKE A BOSS</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve actually thought a lot about HL3 vs Ep3. This is what I came up with.</p>
<p>I think that an Episode 3 on the Source engine and Half-Life 3 on Source 2 would keep with what Valve has been doing with the series so far, even if they didn’t mean to. HL3 would be the flagship game for a brand new engine, like HL2 was for Source. This would require them to be actually making Source 2, but they’re not saying anything.</p>
<p>Speaking in general, regardless of engine, I want an Ep3 before a HL3. Episode 3 would finish the Half-Life 2 storyline, and Half-Life 3 would be a new storyline, like another job the G-Man has for Gordon. I call this the Assassin’s Creed model. I have no idea what HL3’s “job” would be, but that’s just an idea.</p>

<p>They can’t just do that. They ended Ep2 with Eli’s death. They have to continue it from there or it’ll piss a lot of people off, me included. If you start a massive story arc you have to complete it. It’s the same as giving a cop-out ending.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, I think they could do manage that.  It would be tricky and they’d have to come up with a great new story and often refer back to Eli, but if anyone could pull it off it would be Valve.</p>

            <p>HL3 will probably be a whole new world (Hush, Menken!) but that doesn’t mean that they’re going to ignore what happened at the end of Ep2.  HL2:Ep3 should wrap up the Combine story arc before going to HL3 (the G-Man’s employers?).</p>

<p>Acording to Marc Laidlaw, he prefers to make new worlds for his stories than just make sequels of the same thing, maybe HL3 will wring something totaly new, Valve opts for the writers freedom when making a story rather than stick with the same thing, if that is correct the could make a whole new story just like HL2.</p>

<p>The teleporter malfuncion caused Gordon to teleport into three other random locations before actually ending up at the reciever, which is uncontrollable &amp; hardly useful. The process still required a reciever for him to be sent to, but the connection broke.</p>

            <p>Acording to Marc Laidlaw, he prefers to make new worlds for his stories than just make sequels of the same thing, maybe HL3 will wring something totaly new, Valve opts for the writers freedom when making a story rather than stick with the same thing, if that is correct the could make a whole new story just like HL2.</p>

<p>People thought the same about the Combine Dispatch, whose voice somehow lived on in Episode 2.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s somewhat different - they probably have lots of those stationed in various areas (my pet theory is that they’re pretty much the female version of stalkers). The Combine are unlikely to have any machine schematics backups outside Citadels - the chances of them being destroyed by rebels is hugely smaller even than Nova Prospekt.</p>

<p>It’s possible, but that happens at the end of Ep2 so it’s a separate issue, and again, they’ve got more important things taking up their time at this point than building another in-universe teleporter.</p>
<p>I think what it comes down to is: through some fastidious logic could the Combine conceivably have managed to regain in-universe teleportation during the Uprising? Probably. Considering how the story has been presented is it likely or going to have any significance if they have? Not really.</p>

<p>The Portal Storm seems to be a natural phenomenon* triggered by big quantities of energy, weird crystals and powerful tecnology, the combine did not just use teleporters to get to Earth they also took the superportals for the masive invasion, those citadels came directly from the combine world, the invasion was similar to the one of BM just way bigger on a Global scale.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve always imagined the portal storms to be a result of uncontrolled tunneling between universes, temporary disruptions in the laws of physics.</p>
<p>The combine superportal in EP2 - which seems to be just a really big, controlled tear in the fabric of the universe, whereas a normal portal would be careful and precise - and the completely-out-of-control resonance cascade would both fit this description.</p>
