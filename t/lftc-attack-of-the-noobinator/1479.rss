    <title>LFTC: Attack of the Noobinator</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lftc-attack-of-the-noobinator/1479</link>
    <description>Saw that there was a thread here that contained a few of the Leak-Free comics back in the days so I thought I&#39;d post my comics.

This was my first comic made back in 2005 during the Leak-Free days - probably pretty lame by todays standard but I had fun doing it and hope you&#39;ll enjoy it.
