    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/post-the-worst-game-breaking-bugs/7990</link>
    <description>i&#39;ve been trying to finish L.A.Noire before Skryim comes out to get all the games i have on my plate out of the way. Once November 11th comes, i&#39;ll be pretty much exclusive to Skyrim for at least a year.

Anyway, after finishing the first Arson Desk case, i ended up getting the worst ending and royally botched the case. Figured i&#39;d just replay the case and finish it properly, i went to the &quot;Cases&quot; menu and replayed it. Without realizing it would FUCK UP MY GAME, the game over-wrote my &quot;Story Mode Save&quot; with a &quot;Replay&quot; file.

Now the only way to advance in the game is to start aaaaaaaaaall the way over from the very first case and work my way back up. Just in case you haven&#39;t played L.A.Noire, each case can take up to an hour to complete and my next step was somewhere around the 15th (or so) case.

it&#39;s mind-boggling that something as simple as a gui glitch could completely break your game progress. Even more that Rockstart hasn&#39;t put any effort into a fix for it.

On that note, what are the worst game-breaking glitches you&#39;ve ever experienced?

<p>My vote goes to Shadow of Chernobyl, pre-patching. It was rage enducing.</p>

<p>The icing on the rage cake was that after applying every patch, you had to start over from the beginning. in its first 2 weeks, there were over 4 patches that all either wiped your saves or rendered them unusable.</p>

            <p>Hell, the chapter “Keep Moving” never worked right because the AI kept falling behind on hitting their cues, so a door that was supposed to be open wouldn’t be open and I’d get gunned down. Uncharted 2 was damn fun but had quite a few bugs &gt;&lt;</p>

            <p>There was a part in Uncharted 2 where I had to have Elaina’s help to open a door but she stayed in cover like there were still enemies around even though they were all dead. I had to reload an earlier save and kill the enemies all again to get past it.</p>

            <p>The fiasco that was Gears of War (windows) (took me about 3 hours to get the game to even start up, several out of the box game breaking bugs, crash at startup screen.</p>
<p>In Planescape Torment, when trying to get the keys to Delora’s heart from Mirriam, never could manage to convince him, even when i used the walkthrough… always end up pickpocketing them from him instead lol, so not game breaking.</p>

            <p>I used to love playing Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader, and even still play it from time to time, but I’m afraid firefly has killed their only chance at redeeming themselves. Firefly is talking about releasing patches to fix the game but they’re going to need more than patches to fix this mess more like a complete overhaul and a free expansion pack. If you want to know more information on how bad this game is, go to the firefly forums people are asking for refunds every second!</p>

            <p>Well the most hilarious game breaking bug I ever encountered was probably back in 2001 or 2002. I was playing a run through of half-life for the umteenth time and on the rail ride through, everyone started dying. Literally, as soon as I looked at a any NPC, they would drop dead. After getting stuck on the train when the Barney dropped dead at the mere sight of me I quit in fits of laughter. Something strangely amusing in the absurdity of everyone just dying by you seeing them.</p>

            <p>I think I have been pretty lucky the last few years, only game stopper bug I had was Farcry 2, but not due to doors not opening, but due to a dude standing in the doorway. I He effectively trapped me in a hut and no matter what I did - no escape! I had to reload and lose about 10 mins of gameplay…oh well.</p>
<p>The best game stopper of all time happened to my friend while I watched him complete original Half Life. He killed the big floaty monster (i forget name) and died on the way down on a spike :’( However, the game continued and all we could see was G-mans feet and bits of Xen in the background.:meh:</p>
<p>Finally on the tram, he says ‘Time to choose Mr Freeman, time to choose’ But of cause being dead has the undesirable side effect of not being able to move - ‘Its time to choose’ :[ Then suddenly the tram doors shut and he is transported to a room full of hundreds of feet!:zip: LOL</p>

            <p>Basically any glitch in Call Of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth.</p>
<p>Great game plagued with so many sad bugs – thankfully they can be overcame with a little skill and some luck… after 47 times.</p>

            <p>not really game breaking as it is amusing, often times, when I end a Mission in Saints Row 2 and Still have Homies walking around and the Mission reverts back to playable in front of the Saint’s Hideout in the Redlight district, the Homies will get stuck in the walls</p>
