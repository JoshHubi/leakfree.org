    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-your-opinion-on-the-lyrics-of-my-song/6122</link>
    <description>hey guys, recently I&#39;ve been working on my own songs after 3 years of covering other bands. here&#39;s my first lyrics for my song, need your opinions on it and suggestions would be cool 



                                                      I Am Nothing

&quot;Verse1&quot;

I am Hated, Rejected!
I am Tired of this
I can&#39;t hear you anymore
I am Nothing, no More!



&quot;Chorus&quot;
no more abusing me
no more lying to me
my feelings are hungry for more
all I see is deception
all I feel is rejection


&quot;Verse2&quot;
give me your feelings
so I can step on them
I&#39;ll give you my heart
so you can break it

&quot;Chorus&quot;
am so sick of your games
you cannot see the pain that&#39;s
inside of me !
you cannot understand my feelings
I am nothing but a lifeless void

&quot;Interlude + Solo&quot;


&quot;Verse3&quot;

I am Hated, Rejected!
I am Nothing, no More!
I can&#39;t hear you anymore
I am Nothing, no More!

&quot;Chorus&quot;
no more abusing me
no more lying to me
my feelings are hungry for more
all I see is deception
all I feel is rejection


&quot;Outro&quot;</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>My opinion:</p>
<p>The Verses and the chorus seem sincere, and I understand the emotion they are conveying. But verse 2 seems fabricated in context, as if artificially cynical, probably because the lyrical I first feels like a victim and ignored in the verse 1 and the chorus, and yet wants to destroy the exchange of emotion with the addressee in verse 2.</p>
<p>“Verse2”<br>
give me your feelings<br>
so I can step on them<br>
I’ll give you my heart<br>
so you can break it</p>
<p>This is by itself very interesting poetry. But I am confused as to what the lyrical I really wants. That is why verse 2 stands out and seems a bit hypocritical, almost artificially sinister, like a terrifying gothic castle on a blooming meadow on a beautiful summer day, the longing for emotion being the summer day and the castle being the cynicism.</p>
<p>The frequent use of “more” [e.g. ‘anymore’, ‘no more’] seemed repetitve at first but creates a very interesting effect. On the one hand the lyrical I is asking for the suffering to end, but the frequent use of the word  ‘more’ that is very present when you read the poem aloud, contradicts this on the audible level.</p>
<p>Try changing verse 2 into a metaphor, e.g. to how everyone is sucking out positive emotions out of the lyrical I like a giant black hole of douchbaggery and self-loathing. Or change everything except verse 2 to, as has been proposed, how the lyrical I is going to kick the ass of the abusers.</p>
<p>Keep it up!</p>

            <p>from the beginning of the start I’ve always felt</p>
<p>the days flew past with the time and the daze</p>
<p>enjoying our lives, we were all in a haze</p>
<p>I know one day, I’ll get up, we’ll rise</p>
<p>but 'til then I won’t let the clock phase me</p>
<p>beer in hand and I let our gazes meet</p>
<p>you’ll feel good, she’ll feel right</p>
<p>we go home and our bodies touch, my feelings fly</p>
<p>the morning comes, the sun shines</p>
<p>we both go our separate ways, this is how it’s always been</p>
<p>from the beginning of the start I’ve always felt</p>
<p>the days flew past with the time and the daze</p>
<p>enjoying our lives, we were all in a haze</p>
<p>I know one day, I’ll get up, we’ll rise</p>
<p>but 'til then I won’t let the clock phase me</p>
<p>that sour taste in my mouth, rotten, dreary wake-ups</p>
<p>shake it off, tomorrow is soon, thoughts of brighter days—</p>
<p>make me swoon, regular habits and routine behaviors</p>
<p>indulge in food and chat with friends, up to date with usual trends</p>
<p>this is how it’s always been and will always be</p>
<p>I just made this and I MAY OR MAY NOT have had a few beverages, but regardless.</p>

            <p>Angsty lyrics aren’t bad by default, the problem with these lyrics is that they’re super generic. They could have been written by any other emo kid. I don’t want to offend you Shadi, it’s just that they feel really shallow and unoriginal.</p>

            <p>Too angsty for my tastes, but you might want to let us know what kind of music it’s for.  Ballad style?  Acid metal?  Gregorian chant?</p>

            <p>hey guys, recently I’ve been working on my own songs after 3 years of covering other bands. here’s my first lyrics for my song, need your opinions on it and suggestions would be cool</p>
<pre><code>                                                  I Am Nothing
</code></pre>
<p>“Verse1”</p>
<p>I am Hated, Rejected!<br>
I am Tired of this<br>
I can’t hear you anymore<br>
I am Nothing, no More!</p>
<p>“Chorus”<br>
no more abusing me<br>
no more lying to me<br>
my feelings are hungry for more<br>
all I see is deception<br>
all I feel is rejection</p>
<p>“Verse2”<br>
give me your feelings<br>
so I can step on them<br>
I’ll give you my heart<br>
so you can break it</p>
<p>“Chorus”<br>
am so sick of your games<br>
you cannot see the pain that’s<br>
inside of me !<br>
you cannot understand my feelings<br>
I am nothing but a lifeless void</p>
<p>“Interlude + Solo”</p>
<p>“Verse3”</p>
<p>I am Hated, Rejected!<br>
I am Nothing, no More!<br>
I can’t hear you anymore<br>
I am Nothing, no More!</p>
<p>“Chorus”<br>
no more abusing me<br>
no more lying to me<br>
my feelings are hungry for more<br>
all I see is deception<br>
all I feel is rejection</p>
<p>“Outro”</p>
