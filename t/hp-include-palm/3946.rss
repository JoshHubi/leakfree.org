<p>One thing that always annoyed me about PalmOS, was the signature white border around the screen, after the B/W devices it became kinda pointless and ugly, it would have totally ruined watching movies on it if TCPMP didn’t have an option to disable it and even use the extra pixel space  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Palm was THE company for smart phones. They invented the palmpilot (notice how there name is in it) and the next natural step once cell phone became popular they combined the devices. For a long time nothing even came close. The problem was that they began to stagnate as a company. They stopped innovating, kept relying on the same mobile operating system with no major revisions and even for a period partnered with Microsoft for a palm device that ran windows mobile (eeewwwww). So as time passed the competition did as well. Palm was expected to bankrupt (was even placed on engadgets company deathwatch) until a new CEO took over and drastically changed things. They released a new operating system called WebOS (awesome) and the palm pre and pixi. The problem was they spend a bunch of money getting to this point and partnering with sprint (crappy phone company) proved to be a fatal flaw. They are now way in the red and are having a hard time recovering. This is when they announced that they were for sale. The rest you should know.</p>
<p>And that is a breif history about palm. A company that was the leader and is now the underdog.</p>

            <p>I’ve had a palm pilot, palm 3 and palm tungsten T3, the tungsten was from 1999 and had the same LCD screen as the iPhone.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>well it seems that Hp as decided to absorb palm into the larger company but stated that it will still function as a separate unit. So hopefully palm will keep doing what they’ve been doing but with more funding.</p>
