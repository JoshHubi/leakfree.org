    <description>Anything I say in this thread is not to be taken seriously, and is simply because I can, and in the spirit of the fool&#39;d on April Fool&#39;s day.

Hi,OIMjustGfoundSoutEyourCwebsiteRcrashedElastTnightM(April 1st of all days!),EandSfollowedSaAconvenientlyGplacedElinkFbackTinWtime,RwithOtheFinstructionsLtoMwarnAyouOand prevent this horrific event from occurring.  Honestly, it wouldn&#39;t have been the first time my computer has created temporal rifts...  It&#39;s pulled files ranging from six hours to seven months in the future!

Anyway, this is my most sincere warning to whomever it may concern to do everything within your power short of--- nay, INCLUDING, but not limited to throwing yourself under a bus to prevent these forums from crashing at an indeterminate point in the future.

Thank you for your time.</description>

            <p>I don’t remember there being steam tags in the past, therefore I conclude that “indeterminate amount of time” can only be up to 24 hours in the past.</p>

<p>Hi, I just found out your website crashed last night (April 1st of all days!), and followed a conveniently placed link back in time, with the instructions to warn you and prevent this horrific event from occurring.  Honestly, it wouldn’t have been the first time my computer has created temporal rifts…  It’s pulled files ranging from six hours to seven months in the future!</p>
<p>Anyway, this is my most sincere warning to whomever it may concern to do everything within your power short of— nay, INCLUDING, but not limited to throwing yourself under a bus to prevent these forums from crashing at an indeterminate point in the future.</p>
