I would blow up a city built around an atomic bomb, then enslave everyone I see with a cool gun.
Wait...</description>

<p>But propably I would just die.</p>

            <p>First I’d call some druids of the wild to restore a patch of land for me like it was before the apocalypse. Then I’d call all the good people I know and built a great city there with all the luxaries a real city has. It will also have rules and order. I will call it New Podgorica. From there I expand. While druids restore more and more lands we make use of it for more farmlands which attracts even more people. Eventually I’ll raise more cities like this and then the world will be mine. I will be bathed in glory forever.</p>

            <p>i’d use a tarpaulin a lot to shelter me and my son and i’d scavenge the barren grey landscape for anything humane and useful.<br>
sighting any people i’d be very careful and go by the ‘it’s me or him’ attitude by default.<br>
the soft ashes would swirl along the brittle paving and the trees would perplex and obscure with impenetrable shadows.<br>
we would head south, because there’s no surviving another winter here.</p>
<p>we would keep off road, to not be seen, and we would persist because we carry the fire.</p>

            <p>I would hope that people have burned all the bibles in the world, I would find this one bible and control the weak with it and then get fucked over by denzel washington who is blind.<br>

            <p>I bestride streetlights, past pestilent waters<br>
Seven dashes of ash, the sun shines<br>
I write a poem, cabbage pudding lenience</p>
<p>Crossing streets I cower, past imminent slaughter<br>
