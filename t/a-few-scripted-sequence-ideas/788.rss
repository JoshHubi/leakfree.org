    <title>a few scripted sequence ideas</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-few-scripted-sequence-ideas/788</link>
    <description>title says all. most of these are on Xen, but there are one or two that aren&#39;t, so sorry if they are impossible. here goes:

1- at some point on xen, you see a few rebellious vortigaunts fighting a controller and a couple of agrunts,  the agrunts are killed and the controller is cornered, however the controller suddenly clasps it&#39;s head as if doing something psychic, and the vortigaunts&#39; collars and bands begin to glow red or orange, the vortigaunts begin to shiver and scream in pain and eventually collapse on the floor.

2-

I like this idea. the devs should get some inspiration from CoD 4 for this, for instance, they should have something similar to the scene were Cpt. price sneaks up and stabs a spetznaz in the back of the neck; the player comes accross an assassin backstabbing a scientist/security guard, the assassin then quietly lays the body down before seeing the player and whipping out her pistols, putting a few bullets in the HEV suit and then running off.
[/quote]
 
I posted this in the &quot;the Assassins&quot; thread, the OP had suggested that the assassins try to stab the player in close combat, so I came up with the above idea.

3-the player should see on Xen some vortigaunts examining the body of a HEV scientist. for example they should be pushing the body around, trying to break into the HEV suit, and zapping it now and then.

4-to give the player an idea of what is happening in the factory, the player should come accross some vortigaunts (who shouldn&#39;t attack because it&#39;s the factory scene) carrying a deformed or ill looking Agrunt pod, it should also be twitching wildly (normal pods should also be twitching, but less than that) , the vortigaunts put it down and break into it revealing the dying, deformed fetus of a defective agrunt, which they then zap out of it&#39;s misery.

5-finally, not really a scripted sequence, but hey. there should be vortigaunts all over the factory repairing machinery, the devs should use the effect from HL2 were the vortigaunt attaches the gun to the airboat for this.

Maybe it’s too late now but I was thinking about that chapter to illustrate the slow debacle of HECU until FAF and the evac : first parts of the level shows cordinates operations and counter offensives from HECU squads with armor or aerial support against a same scale alien force. But the more you advance, the more you see and fight fewer grunts or less organized squads. Then HECU starts going only defending themselves and lose the initiative. Losing support (copter down or armor destroyed) could also force soldiers to temporarily fall back and regroup.</p>
<p>Lambda complex needs more personnel at the end near the teleport, looking busy and preparing it for you (in some rooms or on plateforms/catwalks) : the lambda team gives you really impression of trying to stop this mess together. It makes also a strong difference with the rest of the game where BMRF personnel is scattered around lonely and without other goals than survive.</p>

<p>This is good, but might be too much too late. Still… some of this being implimented would be a great addition to the feel of the Xen, and the Complex.</p>

            <p>Well, there’s a whole factory of them, and they have huge metal plates on them.</p>
<p>By the way, in this large room with a tank that you can fire the cannon and machinegun, I noticed that machinegun bullets would sometimes get deflected off dead Agrunts (presumably off their armor). I only noticed it because the machine gun bullets are visible, unlike pretty much all the other weapons.<br>
Dunno if it was a bug or what.</p>

            <p>I doubt they’d take those kind of liberties. We don’t really know how the alien grunts are made? born? manufactured? insert appropriate word here.</p>

<p>I agree with the above. I never had any idea the slaves were docile, and as such the process was made a lot more difficult for me.</p>

<p>Same here. I thought it was a glitch, when I ran in there screaming FUCK YEEEEEEEEEEEEARRRRR!!! and frantically discharging the submachine gun and they did nothing. :pirate:</p>
