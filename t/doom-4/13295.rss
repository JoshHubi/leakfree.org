            <p>Honestly tho, that first wouldn’t have been that bad for the glory kills. I like the speed and intensity but the powerful moves and more dramatic flair would have lent a lot to keeping me doing them, but not overdoing it either.</p>

            <p>I’m a bit late here, but Doom 4/Doom 2016 was very much awesome. It did a great job mixing the old style of gameplay with newer contrivances like upgrades… Well, mostly upgrades, now that I think about it.</p>
<p>I thought it was a neat idea that weapon upgrades only affect the gun’s secondary fire, in most cases. It prevents you from putting all your points into a favorite weapon or two, and then ignoring the rest because they’re underpowered by comparison.</p>

            <p>The game keeps crashing on me. It won’t load the first Hell level because it crashed as soon as it is supposedly done loading, claiming too much video memory is being used. Someone at the Seriously! forums suggested reinstalling the game, so I’m giving that a go.</p>
<p>But the game is a lot of fun when it is working (although the Argent Tower was a bit annoying).</p>

            <p>LOVE THE GAME.  I only have 2 gripes.  1, the audio just doesn’t sound right on my rig, I have tried with on board soundcard and a 7.1 sound card.  it just feels like there isn’t enough channels going at once and a lot of the audio gets clumped together as if I’m missing some channels, this is minor, still sounds good, just not AS good as I think it should.</p>
<p>2, the sli support is not so great, there is no NVidia profile for it yet, and It runs better on 1x980 than on 2.  I would like to upgrade to 2x1080’s, but with the sli support lacking, it seems currently that 2x1080s would be a waste of money if its something they aren’t going to support.  2x980s on games that have been out a for a bit outperform a 1080 on every benchmark. although 2 1080s make some games playable at 4k resolution with over 110fps. I would just prefer to know that sli will be supported well before pulling the trigger.</p>
<p>cant wait to play through this game at 1440p</p>

            <p>And here it is, one of the few developers who still truly care and fully support their products post launch.</p>
<p>I’ve watched a full walkthrough of Doom after the release and it was fucking awesome, definitely what I was looking for. But the MP seemed like it never truly left the Beta stage, still lacking quite a damn lot.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me that wouldn’t have been <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">such a big</span></span> problem since I’ve always been a SP guy, but a lame and half-baked MP definitely wouldn’t go hand in hand with a superb SP experience. And beside, I wouldn’t have been able to completely ignore the MP anyway, since the campaign would become boring after a couple of replays due to remembering the levels and so on (after all it’s not like Skyrim, a fully modable game where I can install hundreds of mods so that each playthrough is different at least in a way or another and thus still feel fresh the 666th time).</p>
<p>I’m keeping an eye out to see what the future preserves for Doom.</p>

            <p>I’m playing the campaign right now and I’m absolutely loving it, hordes of mobs, and very oldschool in both item design and gameplay.</p>

            <p>Yeah I dunno how I feel about snap map yet. Maybe after I fiddle with it a little more, I dunno.</p>
<p>Also, do yourselves a favor, drop into the foundry, into the molten metal. Please. You won’t regret it.</p>

            <p>The only disappointment was the multiplayer.</p>
<p>Seriously, I think it´s worth it just for the campaign and snapmap (snapmap feels slightly unpolished though).</p>

            <p>So I all nighter’d it and beat it.</p>
<p>My impressions after this first play through, on “Hurt Me Plenty”:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">SPOILERS AHEAD; I CANT GET MY SPOILER BUTTON TO WORK ON MOBILE SO THIS IS YOUR WARNING.</span></p>
<p>The campaign is fantastic. The codex/data thing adds serious depth to the game, lore wise, and the the story is actually kinda entertaining. The artifacts in Hell add some really cool backstory to how you came to be where you are at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself is flawless, and every enemy is fun to fight. Pinky’s are actually kinda difficult, especially when paired with other demons. I love the demons designs, and the melee combat is brutal as hell. I mean, come on, you can rip a fucking hell knights head off and bludgeon a baron with his own antler thing. Who wouldn’t want to?</p>
<p>The characters are great, even if there’s only like really 4 characters in the game. Their lines are well delivered, and thanks to the codex, they’re actual character is very real to the the player.</p>
<p>The guns are “ohmyfuckinggod” great. I love every single one, and with the weapon mods, it makes the harrowing fights even better. They’re just enough to give you an edge, but they don’t make you a tank either, it’s very well balanced. You’ll still have your hands full, even WITH a full arsenal at your disposal.</p>
<p>My only cons are that I wish your character had personality, buuuttttt at the same time, I dunno how they’d manage that. I also wish that the chainsaw worked on smaller enemies without ammo dumps, even without fuel, and would only provide big kills and ammo dumps with the right amount of fuel.</p>
<p>Other than that, I was happy, and I love how it’s so open to a sequel.</p>

            <p>haven’t dived into multiplayer yet, but the campaign alone is WELL WORTH the price of admission</p>
