    <description>I&#39;m looking for games like Stalker, with plots that involve conspiracies and paranormal things and that. With dark atmospheres, suspense, and that stuff, you know what I mean? So, can you give me some names?</description>

            <p>The Assassin’s Creed series is pretty much all conspiracies. The main enemies of the game have had their hand in nearly every conspiracy the world has ever seen, and then some more later on in the series.</p>

            <p>FEAR 1 was a great game, monolith did a pretty good job making the story much more then an excuse to have matrix-style slomo in a game. 2 was eh, and 3 felt like a joke.</p>
<p>Also definitely recommend MGS1 as well, as long as you stay away from Twin Snakes.</p>

            <p>I started from 3 and I personally loved it. MGS1 was still good, even despite the older style gameplay. But eh, different strokes for different folks I guess.</p>

            <p>No. If you’re going to play MGS start with the first one. You don’t want to start with the one with the best (or one of the best) gameplay. It would make it difficult to go back and play the earlier ones. And you should get the story in the order it was meant.</p>

            <p>F.E.A.R. is more of a coverup than a conspiracy. A coverup of a REALLY bad thing. Good story, that game.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed as a franchise has a conspiracy story spanning thousands of years of recorded history. It’s so ludicrously insane that it’s surprisingly compelling.</p>
<p>Metal Gear games also dabble in conspiracy theories, along with the general tendency of certain villains to quadruple cross people. I started with MGS3. It’s pretty standalone and has more modern features and gameplay than MGS1.</p>
