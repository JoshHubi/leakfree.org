    <title>Scientists won&#39;t open door. Possibly lazy?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/scientists-wont-open-door-possibly-lazy/11282</link>
    <description>I just rescued the scientists from the surgical machine and followed them to the hallway outside the containment door. They told me to go ahead of them. I have tried clicking everything and waiting a long time. They just sit there and will not respond to attempts to communicate with them. I read the walk through and it appears they should open the containment door to the lobby. Is this a glitch, or do I just have lazy scientists?

<p>Do you have a quick save close to that point that you could easily go and retry?</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes. I went back and it did work the next time. It appears that something made the older scientist stop and then nothing would make him open the door.</p>
