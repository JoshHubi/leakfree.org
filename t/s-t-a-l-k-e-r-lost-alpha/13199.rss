    <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Lost Alpha</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-lost-alpha/13199</link>
    <description>Coming out April 26th, i.e. tomorrow (or tonight, depends on when they release and your time zone)

Also standalone, so you don&#39;t need any STALKER game to play it

[url]https://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha[/url]

Years of development and it&#39;s finally actually coming out

It&#39;s a shame given the circumstances of the leak, but still

            <p>I can’t say I’ve ever complete that quest. You should get something though. I think you need to go back to Sid and say “I’m here for the job” and then pick the right one. Could be a broken quest though for all I know.</p>

            <p>Hey, people, I have a question (please help me out): I recently began playing the game, and did come for the reward back to the indicated place, but could not get it: I killed the zombies, and received nothing in return. Is it normal (I mean, I acquired enough money to play happily by doing not much, but …)?</p>

<p>cam_inert 0 does not turn off headbob by itself.</p>
<p>Try walking across your room right now.  Did you notice your view bobbing?  If so, do it again, but this time stop walking funny on purpose.  Your brain filters that shit out.  It’s not “realistic;” by far the most realistic in-game view mode is the “floating camera” that so many people seem to hate.</p>
<p>This is the same reason that motion blur in videogames is bullshit.  Try whipping your head around a bit - or just looking back and forth between two objects with only your eyes.  Did you notice motion blur?  The answer is no, because you go blind while your fov is in motion.  Literally.  Your brain shuts off your vision while your fov is rapidly changing.</p>
<p>This happens to be a bit of a pet peeve of mine.  The latter is also one of the more interesting challenges faced by the Oculus Rift.</p>

</aside>
<p>Who said anything about realism? I just like head bob. I also like reloading in CS and CoP better than SoC because it tilts your view slightly. I like running around in doom and quake and older games because they have a small amount of view bobbing. When i turn it off in those games I feel like my character is sliding around like a vehicle.</p>
<p>And with the exception of the oculus rift, looking at a monitor playing a game and turning a joystick or a mouse to turn feels nothing like looking around in real life, though I understand if you don’t like it.</p>

            <p>Wow, the mod murdered my machine.  Then I turned off grass shadows and it ran silky smooth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the old anti-head-bob mod for the original STALKER games no longer works; it breaks the game.  The headbobbing in this isn’t <span class="bbcode-i">as</span> bad as it was in the original, but I’d still like it off.</p>

            <p>On what would be equivalent to CoP settings it runs smoothly.</p>
<p>On the mod’s max settings in DX10? Ranges from 40 in empty areas to 20 in areas with a high population.</p>
<p>On a 770.</p>
<p>I had to disable grass shadows and turn down view distance (which is apparently more than double most mods) put to about half, and put sun rays to low, AA to 2x and shadow resolution to medium to get it to run consistently smoothly where the slowdowns weren’t bothersome enough to warrant any more changes.</p>
<p>Runs fine on DX9 max though, but it lacks a lot of the spiffy features and proper AA</p>

<p>700 series for all maxed? Dayum son. I mean I have a 670 so it’ll handle most things on hight but still. I rarely play with all max settings in games, but that’s just…wow.</p>
<p>I guess it’s only a surprise since I feel not too many games ‘require’ such powerful cards (yet, anyway).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m going to be really surprised if my 580 breaks a sweat running this mod.  After all, it runs Crysis on full settings without slowdown.  Unless the mod is specifically making use of some technology that nVidia introduced in their 700 series cards, I’m guessing this is another case of people not understanding how nVidia and ATI name their cards.  The 700 is the series, and the last two digits are the model within that series.  The higher the last two digits, the more powerful the card.  Each series gets a bit more powerful than the last, but generally, the 580 performs about as well as the 680 performs about as well as the 780, and ditto all the way down.</p>
<p>It’s funny to me that they just recommend a 700, because if I were running, say, a 750, their mod would probably eat my card alive on full settings.</p>
<p>EDIT: Jesus, only one person is seeding the torrent?</p>

<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: LOST ALPHA Patch v1.3001 (2nd of May 2014.) changelog: The patch is savegame compatible, so You do not have to start new game for this patch, but for maximum experience it’s recommended. If you installed 3rd party / user made fixes and mods for Lost Alpha, it’s highly recommended to reinstall the game to have a clean install before you apply the official patch.

            <p>We’ll see I guess. I was thinking that too but considering GSC is essentially just Sergej I don’t know how much he could really do. I suppose he could hire a bunch of lawyers but since he’s not really making any money right now he might just want to not waste the cash on that.</p>
<p>And it is a custom version that was used to make a free game but I don’t know how much that would affect it.</p>
<p>Edit: Seems someone made a kneejerk reaction about the source code. The bug catching program says it’s SoC’s version of the engine, plus there’s only r1 and r2 files while LA goes up to r3. Still a cool thing, but not as cool. And someone could still improve it.</p>

<p>Cool as it could be to see more games on the engine, wouldn’t GSC take action against anyone trying to use the leaked version?</p>

            <p>Not happening tonight. There’s a post on a Polish forum about the game saying that the zip file was compressed wrong and that they need to do a bunch of stuff to recompress it and that that’s even what they’ve been doing for quite awhile now I guess. (shitty)Translation is</p>

            <p>700 series for all maxed? Dayum son. I mean I have a 670 so it’ll handle most things on hight but still. I rarely play with all max settings in games, but that’s just…wow.</p>
<p>I guess it’s only a surprise since I feel not too many games ‘require’ such powerful cards (yet, anyway).</p>

            <p>The issue was the game stuttered when applying settings kind of like what happens in HL2, so I hope they changed that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  . Also sometimes on initial startup the game would revert to lower than low settings and I had to fix that but again that sounds like something that might happen in a buggy leak beta thing. And forcing msaa through the control panel works so I’ve been doing that in most Stalker games.</p>
<p>So excited, they need to hurry up and put the download up.</p>

            <p>You could do that in Quake and Unreal/UT with the FOV, and I know it also works in Crysis.</p>
<p>The thing about STALKER’s AA is that it only partially works. It works on vegetation, but a lot of times on buildings and other objects it doesn’t seem to.</p>
<p>Though I think that’s okay, because vegetation is a large part of what you see so the AA working there helps visual quality a lot, and for everything else you can force it through the control panel.</p>
<p>I think that’s why LA devs had to implement AA themselves maybe? Because CS/CoP’s was broken like that?</p>
<p>Also that’s cool that you don’t have to restart. I hate when games require you to.</p>
