    <title>[FIXED] Aprehension: exposition dumping scientist no longer dumps exposition</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixed-aprehension-exposition-dumping-scientist-no-longer-dumps-exposition/13847</link>
    <description>I play the beginning bit of apprehension normally, making it up to the scientist who tells you about the Xbow in the shark cage. All of his gestures are playing normally, but none of the dialog is triggering. When his event is over, he may or may not walk in front of the room&#39;s exit and stay there, blocking the player.

It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what I do leading up to this point, the error is consistent.</description>
