    <title>Playing Black Mesa if you haven&#39;t played Half-Life</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/playing-black-mesa-if-you-havent-played-half-life/9475</link>
    <description>Hello guys!

So I&#39;m a big fan of Half-Life 2 and Valves games in general. I actually consider HL2 to be the best game of all time, and yet I haven&#39;t played its predecessor. I do own HL1 and I&#39;ve tried it for a few hours, but I didn&#39;t really get into the game for some reason. It didn&#39;t get me that great feeling I get from HL2, maybe because I&#39;m bothered by the fact that it&#39;s an old game. 

Anyway, I haven&#39;t played HL1 and now BM is about to be released and I&#39;m unsure if I should really play BM wihout playing HL1 first. Do you think I would have a better experience of BM if I&#39;ve played HL1 first, or vice versa?

I&#39;d really appreciate some opinions on this &#39;problem&#39;.  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>HL1 is masterpiece with old graphics. BMS is mod dedicated for that masterpiece. I myself never expected for BMS to be better than HL1 because I prefer gameplay over graphics.<br>
However to me it looks like its opposite for OP and he prefers graphics as far more important than quality of gameplay.</p>

            <p>Play BM first so you’ll get surprised then play HL to at least get a nostalgic feeling about BM and HL. (Reversed, huh?)</p>

            <p>I Played Black Mesa before HL1, problem is not Graphics (i play doom from time to time), i just can’t stick with it, the gameplay is the outdated thing, Black Mesa isn’t here just for Graphics, it is here for gameplay too.</p>

<p>Agreed. Half Life 1 was my first FP shooter in my entire life (literally) and it was a blast. I played it maybe…1 week before I played Black Mesa. They were both extremely fun.</p>
<p>Half Life 2 just annoyed me. Both the boat thingo and the go-kar looking machine just didn’t entertain me. Half way through the car scene I just went “screw it” and turned on god mode anytime I reached a location where I’d have to go against enemies. It was just boring.<br>
Then again overall it was boring and didn’t capture me like HL1 did. Something about it, the graphics, the gameplay. It all felt different to me, and not necessarily in a good way.</p>

<p>I think you will enjoy it either way. If you didn’t play HL you probably won’t get this nostalgic feel, but however I don’t think that playing a really outdated game will increase your joy in playing bm.</p>

<p>Agreed, it doesn’t really matter which you play first.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, it is better to play Black Mesa first, because most of us played HL in the past and knew what it’s coming. But with you having not playing the game, you will be surprised more often instead of a few times  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>What many people here don’t seem to be taking in to consideration is that nobody is going to have nostalgia from a 14 year old game that they played for the first time yesterday. That just isn’t how it works. If he didn’t play the game in 1999 then loading it up today isn’t going to do anything to better his enjoyment of black mesa. In fact I think it could possibly hinder his enjoyment of the mod. Why not play black mesa and get your half life experience in the way that is fitting for someone brought up in today’s gaming world and then 14 years from now you will have that same magical nostalgia the rest of us have of the original. Hell is that not why this mod was started to begin with?</p>

            <p>honestly HL1 is a better game than HL2, as much as i love source</p>
<p>that said, go ahead and play BM first; you won’t get the nostalgia or whatever playing it today</p>

            <p>Obviously, I haven’t played Black Mesa yet, but I can say with confidence that Half-Life was one of the best games I’ve ever played.</p>
<p>If you’re new-ish to the franchise and only know the more modern look of HL2, you may be put off a little by the dated graphics. You shouldn’t be, since it really is about the design, the narrative, the attention to detail.</p>
<p>I know that the Black Mesa devs have used the term “re-imagining” at some point. I don’t know if that means they’ve made significant changes to the levels, or just detailed and updated them.</p>
<p>Whichever you choose to play, you’re in for a treat.</p>

<p>Haha, just go look at the system requirements for Q3A. They’re… laughable. Even then, I still play it everyday.  Personally, it has the best replay value for any online game I’ve ever played.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s been years since I’ve played the original Half-Life, so I think Black Mesa will serve as a nice trip down memory lane, all the while providing a novel experience as if I were playing the game for the first time.</p>

            <p>I remember when I’ve first met Half-Life, back in 1999. With my limited english, I didn’t get beyond Anomalous Materials (probably because of the required H.E.V. suit)<br>
I became a fan of the game only a few years later, but I’m still playing with it regularly. I openly say that it’s one of the best action games ever made. Still discovering new things to do there, I can’t get bored with it.</p>
<p>Summa Summarum even if Black Mesa is banging on our doors, you should still give a chance to the original game when you can.</p>

<p>HL:Source has Normalmapping applied to the textures, and a couple of other source features, really badly tacked on. Some of the normalmaps were awful “cones” which cast really bad shadows over the textures.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I recommend to play the original. For me HL Source was a huge disappointment… It’s a really bad port with lots of bugs… and the recoil/screenshake of the assaultrifle is just ridiculous.</p>

            <p>I am a huge HL fan since 2001 and I mainly love HL1DM. I just can’t compare HL1DM with any other multiplayer experience. It’s highly competetive and for me it never gets old.<br>
For the singleplayer I am not THAT amazed but lately I played the Playstation 2 version of HL1 just to compare it to the PC version and I noticed that the first half of HL1 is a bit lame… I think it’s because it’s a strange mix between jump-and run, beating up headcrabs and crouching through vents. However… In the second half of HL1 it’s a blast. You fight a lot more, the maps get bigger and more creative. It’s just a very very awesome experience. You should definately play it when you feel ready for it.</p>

<p>He might underestimate and not enjoy HL1 at all then, though… Because Even if it’s same game at heart, it’s not same in looks. There’s a whole lot of difference between a girl with not so good looks but good personality, and a girl with good looks and same personality as the other.</p>
<p>I’d suggest you playing HL1 up until Xen at least, because only then you’ll appreciate and differentiate things between HL1 and BM, and only then you’ll understand why the base of HL1 is good.</p>

<p>You’re true about not knowing and having no idea on what to expect, but as I said above, after playing BM you might get disappointed with the original…</p>
