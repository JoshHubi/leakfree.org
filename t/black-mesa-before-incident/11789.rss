    <title>Black Mesa before incident.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-before-incident/11789</link>
    <description>Hey, is there any mod where you can visit the whole Black Mesa facilities before the incident? I mean, like going to the Office Complex section before it was destroyed. Full of scientists doing what they&#39;re supposed to do, guards all all that staff. It would be really interesting. You could also cause wreckage by yourself, my idea would be of playing the role of a saboteur who tries to destroy the place. But who knows, maybe someone already had the idea and made it!(?)</description>

            <p>There is one. It is called Black Mesa. In the beginning you walk through several parts of BMRF and you see scientists and guards doing what they are supposed to do. You can break and sabotage things. You can even put a soda machine on the sample cart in the anti mass spectrometer</p>
