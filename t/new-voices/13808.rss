    <description>What do people think about the new voices in Black Mesa?  I prefer  them and enjoy the new lines and effects.  The HECU especially sound human and relatable compared to the voices we saw in the first release.</description>

            <p>I haven’t posted here in so long but it was a desperately needed overhaul and I hope they eventually choose to do the same with the guards and scientists across the board too (if they haven’t already; just bought it), along with another look at the dialogue.<br>
No offense to the guy that voiced the HECU originally.  We know what they were going for originally but it was a bit much.</p>
<p>Maybe the money they get and this little breather will be motivating enough.  They went with the Early Access approach too so they can still just add and revise as they go.</p>
