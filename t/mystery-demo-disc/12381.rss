    <title>Mystery Demo Disc</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mystery-demo-disc/12381</link>
    <description>I have this vague memory of being a child and playing this demo disc on the computer. I don&#39;t have much to go off of, but something might ring a bell to one of you. 

In the menu to pick your desired demo or game or whatnot, there was a Vitruvian Man in the middle, and the games encircled him. A bolt of lightning would strike out from him to highlight whatever game you hovered your mouse over. That&#39;s all I remember. This is probably from the late 90s. My best guess. 

PS: Since my memory is so fuzzy about this, it makes me wonder if it wasn&#39;t some weird dream I may have had. Who knows if it was real, but it&#39;s been on my mind lately.</description>

            <p>Now THAT seems fishy. But I don’t know, it’s practically nostalgic. Wish I knew what it was. Some sort of game collection. Maybe it wasn’t demos.</p>

<p>That might very well be it; I personally don’t trust my oldest memories. Case in point, I have this very distinct memory of visiting a seaside resort in Florida that was in the middle of a wheat field.</p>

            <p>I remember from back in the day that the pirated game collection CD’s from russia always had cool animated launchers, other than that, good luck in your search.</p>
