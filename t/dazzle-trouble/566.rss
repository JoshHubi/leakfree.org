    <title>Dazzle Trouble</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dazzle-trouble/566</link>
    <description>I have decided to buy a Dazzle DVD recorder for recording clips of console gameplay. First though, I wanted to try out my friends to see if it worked. Well it didn&#39;t.

I used the exact same method he uses. I go into windows movie maker an click &#39;capture from video device&#39; I get a perfect preview of the gameplay footage directly from my TV. But the second I press record the preview freezes and when I stop capture the video is just a black screen.

I tried downloading new versions of Movie Maker(including a spanish one for some reason) but to no avail. 

Can someone please help me with my problem?

I know that this is a strange place to ask.</description>

            <p>Not WMM to edit, I know it’s awful. I use Vegas but I need WMM to actually record the footage.</p>
<p>The software that comes with the Dazzle is pathetic. Thin lines all over the screen when recording.</p>
<p>I am currently trying a few things, I will tell yous guys if a get anywhere.</p>

<p>No.<br>
My script is very visual reliant. If I just release my script now, people won’t be able to fully appreciate it.<br>
Plus, it’s not really based on any game universe. It just takes place (mostly) in the game (but sometimes it takes place in the real world, but still filmed using machinima.)</p>

            <p>I assume you want to make Machinima?</p>
<p>Good. I like machinima. I’m working on one right now (though I doubt I’ll ever get started on it, but writing scripts is fun.)</p>

Also, windows movie maker is a joke program, check out the Dazzle manual, their website, and google your problem.</p>
