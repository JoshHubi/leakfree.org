    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cancelled-games-you-wish-made-it-out/6774</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I was browsin YT the other day and came across a really old trailer to a canceled game I was looking forward to way back, and watching it gave me that feeling like &quot;oh man, this really should have made it&quot;. 

I was wondering what canceled games you guys were looking forward to that never came.

Anyways, here&#39;s mine: Stargate SG-1: the Alliance.

Stargate SG-1 being my favorite TV show, I was naturally extremely excited when I heard about this game, and the trailers made me drop my jaw in awe. But then, sometime in 2005 JoWood attempted to cancel it and lawsuits ensued, and when it seemed to be coming back, it was officially cancelled in 2006. When that happened, I died a little inside. I haven&#39;t really cared about any other SG game, the MMO and mp tps that came did not appeal to me. (which those are shut down too now)

I feel like this game could have been a great one if it was ever finished, it seemed like the devs cared about the source material, but it died.

What games make you guys look back every once and a while, and think about how cool the game could&#39;ve been?</description>

            <p>Not sure if this qualifies, but ever since I first played “Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem” on the Gamecube I’ve been eagerly awaiting the sequel. At the time I was convinced it would be out within one or two years, as the game actually contained an advert telling you to watch out for said sequel - but so far all anyone seems to have heard is that they’re “definitely interested” and have been since 2006, which smacks of development hell or quiet cancellation to me…</p>

            <p>I’m doubting anyone here has ever heard of it, but “<a href="https://pc.ign.com/objects/740/740307.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The City of Metronome</a>” looked like a very interesting game. As did the original stealthy sci-fi version of “<a href="https://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2005-dark-sector/6066" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Dark Sector</a>” before they changed it into a Gears of War clone.</p>

<p>Yep. Randy Pitchford said the only reason it seems like it’s taking so long is that Sega announced it only a few days after the deal had been signed. Not even a line of code had been written.</p>

            <p>Another disappointing loss to the video game community was the FPS command and conquer game which i believe was simply called Tiberium. That was announced at GDC back in like 2008 or 2009. Then the project was dropped like 4 months after it was announced. It was pretty much going to be a much, MUCH more refined version of Renegade.</p>
