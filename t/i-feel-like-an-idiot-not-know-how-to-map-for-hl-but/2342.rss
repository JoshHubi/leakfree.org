    <title>I feel like an idiot not know how to map for HL but...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-feel-like-an-idiot-not-know-how-to-map-for-hl-but/2342</link>
    <description>Could I get some help here?

Could anyone tell me what all those wierd entities are and what they do?
(I know what they are but, I want to know how to configure them in the properties box) 

Also, What the heck is Max_Leaf_Faces? :brow:


And lastly, (doesn&#39;t pertain to Hammer) How can I get the music off of the Half-Life CDs. (don&#39;t just give me a download link to a site hosting the actual files. I have a slow internet connection here, so it&#39;ll take forever.) :|

Thank you for reading,

            <p>I’ve learned mapping process with Qeradiant. Almost 3 years of learning. I mean learn anything from tutorials with very basic language skills are not easy. I’ve made three maps with recreated train (it was in 2001) …extremly more details and texture aligment etc… I really enjoyed creating something. Then my HDD crashed day before backuping. I’ve lost all my admire to continue. But today I feel big needs start all over again  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  (I forgot almost everything) Maybe it’s advantage, because Hammer works a litlle bit differently then Qerad… I hope I will manage scripting objectives at least again. Animating characters and script sequences…its out of my IQ abilities  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Well you DID say hammer, which is for source games…<br>
I think you need Worldcraft. Google it and you’ll find all the help you need.</p>

            <p>Could I get some help here?</p>
<p>Could anyone tell me what all those wierd entities are and what they do?<br>
(I know what they are but, I want to know how to configure them in the properties box)</p>
<p>Also, What the heck is Max_Leaf_Faces? :brow:</p>
<p>And lastly, (doesn’t pertain to Hammer) How can I get the music off of the Half-Life CDs. (don’t just give me a download link to a site hosting the actual files. I have a slow internet connection here, so it’ll take forever.) <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Thank you for reading,</p>
