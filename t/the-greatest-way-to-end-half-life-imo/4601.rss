    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-greatest-way-to-end-half-life-imo/4601</link>
    <description>so i was thinking and i believe that the greatest way to end Half-life would be, Gordon traps the Combine leaders on earth. He sets up the final shot, fires. You hear a buzzing noise, then the screen goes blurry as and a new image comes through. YOU&#39;RE BACK IN BLACK MESA DORMS, and your alarm is going off. After that you get up get ready for your shift. go through the intro to HL1, do the experiment and NOTHING GOES WRONG!


Gordon knew what could have happened if something went wrong. With all the stress, he dreamed up a scenario of what could have happened.

or even go all the way to MIT graduation day.</description>

            <p>My point was that Valve pay very much attention to detail. They would never remake the lobby as kinda-similar-but-not-really-the-same as in HL.</p>
<p>On a side note, is it of any significance whatsoever what particular location in BMRF it is?</p>

<p>When the test chamber was breefly seen in HL2 it was 100% recognisable. If Valve would want to show the lobby they wouldn’t make it FUBAR. So it is another location in the vast BMRF and not the lobby seen in HL.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The reason It was 100% recognizable is because it was pretty much copied and pasted strait from HL1. If they did that with the lobby, it would have looked really jarring especially with the high-poly gman sitting in the middle of the room.</p>
