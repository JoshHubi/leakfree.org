    <description>1. Attacking the garg w/the hive hand will cause it flinch lock, similar to what it will do when hit w/explosives.  The hive hand damage probably shouldn&#39;t be made to do this, as it&#39;s secondary fire is too fast and could be used to corral the creature.

2. RPGs and MP5 grenades seem to clip through the garg during the tunnel chase.  However, once the garg makes it into the courtyard, this becomes a non-issue.

3. Garg&#39;s arms clip through the silo door that he prys open.</description>
