    <description>This is a very minor thing, but I&#39;ve noticed that most of the buttons in BM are static. It doesn&#39;t feel very rewarding pressing a button and not watching it move. I&#39;m probably just being picky, but I think it would be nice to make all the buttons in BM animated instead of just being parts of static props. What are your thoughts?</description>

<p>Nearly all the buttons in that game are literally the same button. Easy to copy+paste or use a prefab. In Black Mesa, you’d have to go through every button on a case by case basis to even determine if each button could POSSIBLY be pressed.</p>

            <p>Look, having every single button animated in the game is not needed.And that’s coming from me, a detail freak.<br>
I also had brilliant ideas for the black mesa game.If i recall, i was the one that asked if the body parts could be chopped of<br>
on any part of the body, not just the limbs.Then i realized just how much work would go into that, let alone the time to fix any<br>
problems and unknown issues.</p>
<p>So no, every button animated is just to much.</p>
<p>But there is something else i have realized after the update.<br>
It is just how much details the CC Team has cut from the free mod.<br>
One example are the stuff inside crates.They had physics effects before, and you could’ve grab them.<br>
Now they are non-collidable objects without physics effects.<br>
It was a fun feature, but not needed.</p>

            <p>Name one modern game that has made all the buttons animated.  This has to be one of the most ridiculous feature requests I have ever heard of.</p>

</aside>
<p>I disagree, it’s more a question of where to focus the work, the developer who would do this could spend time working on MP/Xen rather than go back through all the files meticolously changing every single button to make them animate. Sure it would enhance the realism by that little bit, but when it’s such a small thing that takes so long, the time spent on that could’ve been spent on something more worthwhile.</p>
