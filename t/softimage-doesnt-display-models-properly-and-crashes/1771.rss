    <title>Softimage doesn&#39;t display models properly and crashes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/softimage-doesnt-display-models-properly-and-crashes/1771</link>
    <description>Hello

I&#39;m using mod tool 7.5 and the trial version of autodesk softimage 7.5
When I create a new primitive it will only display in wireframe modes; shaded, textured won&#39;t show anything and opengl might sometimes but also causes a crash. When I modify the model in anyway other than changing the subdivisions in the property window it will no longer display, and sometimes show completely corrupt models, such as random lines, and torn polygons.
Opening previous scenes will also display similarly corrupt images, or none at all in all viewing modes, however renders are sometimes fine, sometimes cause a crash.
I&#39;ve the latest drivers and my graphics card seems to work fine with games.
Before I performed a recovery on my PC, Mod tool worked fine.


Does anyone know what might be causing the problem?</description>

            <p>Uninstall your graphics drivers and then install them again? I would assume the system recovery probably broke something there, since this is happening explicitly -after- you did a recovery.</p>
<p>Also make sure XSI is set to display graphics using Direct3D (if it even has an option to do so) as opposed to Software or OpenGL rendering.</p>
