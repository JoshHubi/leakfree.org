    <title>Black mesa level not loading ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-level-not-loading/11529</link>
    <description>Greets. 

After playing through the game one time, I am now trying to start a New Game. At first the game starts fine and I appear to be in the Black Mesa train. When I get to the first &quot;LOADING&quot; screen, it just stays at this LOADING screen and the game appears to be NOT RESPONDING in Windows 7 64 bit Task Manager. 

Any other suggestions other than the reinstall. Thanks.</description>

            <p>Try moving the folder ‘<span class="bbcode-b">SAVE</span>’, located in ‘<span class="bbcode-b">\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS</span>’, to a remote location (such as your Desktop, another folder, an external HDD, ecetera), then starting the game.</p>
<p>If that does not work, create a new ‘<span class="bbcode-b">SAVE</span>’ folder in said directory and make sure its attributes are <span class="bbcode-u">not</span> set to Read-Only - after you moved the previous folder.</p>
