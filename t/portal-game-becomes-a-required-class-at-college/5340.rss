    <description>As the title says, Portal has reached new curricular heights.
[quote]
College students across the country are returning to coursework, friends, and parental freedom soon, but the freshmen class at an Indiana college will find an all-new type of curriculum awaiting them.

According to a Mashable report, Valve&#39;s award-winning puzzle game Portal will appear alongside The Epic of Gilgamesh, Hamlet, and other required materials for incoming freshmen at Wabash College.

The game will be part of the college&#39;s &quot;Enduring Questions&quot; freshman seminar, which explores &quot;fundamental questions of humanity&quot; through &quot;classical and contemporary works.&quot;

Michael Abbot, a theater professor at the school, is helping to design the course. Abbot was reportedly inspired to include Portal in the course&#39;s required experience material by a game theory article that drew similarities between the game and Erving Goffman&#39;s 1959 sociology text The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.

According to the report, Abbot showed Portal to &quot;non-gaming colleagues&quot; and was pleased to learn that they approved of his plan to include both Goffman&#39;s work and Valve&#39;s game in the course&#39;s curriculum. During the course, students will read Goffman&#39;s text followed by a &quot;collective playthrough&quot; of Portal.

While experiencing Portal will not be part of every Enduring Questions section, it is currently being tested by Abbot and his colleagues in select courses.

Further, Abbot said he considered BioShock and Planescape Torment for the class but decided upon Portal because of its relative brevity.

            <p>I read this sitting in my college’s library.  I wish I could use video games more often in college because some of them actually have a point, besides killing people and blowing crap up, although it is uncommon.</p>
<p>I can see discussions about what does GLaDOS mean when she says, “You will be baked and there will be cake?”  Is she being literal, metaphoric, sarcastic?  What does it mean to be human when you are not free, what does it mean to be free?  On and on and on…It’d be ever so interesting to watch people fail at the puzzles too.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ll probably play it a few more times in my lifetime, but I didn’t orgasm over it like the entirety of the internet did when it first came out.  It’s an interesting story with very few puzzles that actually make you think and a decently fancy teleportation gimmick.  Nowhere near the “greatness” of some old-ass boring poetry that has withstood the test of time.  I doubt that in even 30 years Portal will be anything special.</p>
