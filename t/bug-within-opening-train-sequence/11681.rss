    <title>bug within opening train sequence</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bug-within-opening-train-sequence/11681</link>
    <description>So I have just installed Black Mesa, tried to play it through steam, and cannot get further than about 30 seconds into the train sequence!

I can start the train sequence fine, it runs for about 30 seconds, the automated voice tells me about the topside temperature and that the facility is kept at 62 degrees or whatever, then as soon as the train rounds the next corner I get a loading screen and it teleports me to the middle of an outdoor valley with plants and cacti in the sky and what looks like the underground facility floating just off the end of the valley to the right. I cannot move around or do anything exept open and close the menu. I have tried restarting steam several times, and made sure I had the Source SDK base downloaded but I cannot get past the train no matter how I try!</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Have you looked at the 'Faulty Windows Update “KB2735855” can lead to issues! ’ thread on the in game bug reporting forum? Also have you checked your folder name it might be called ‘Black Mesa Source’, If so then rename it to ‘BMS’.</p>
<p>I posted about a week ago but for whatever reason my message wasnt accepted. Will post if i remember the other points i mentioned.</p>
<p>From what your describing it seems like it isnt a download fault. More likely its to do with the placement of the BMS folder or the incorrect name as i mentioned. I’m not so sure about the windows update as i would suspect it would have been dealt with by now, but its worth some thought.</p>

<p>You must be careful when you use noclip.</p>
<p>I’d do in this way:</p>
<p>1-input  “<span class="bbcode-b">sv_cheats 1</span>” and “<span class="bbcode-b">noclip</span>” (will appear on the console something like noclip is ON).<br>
2-with slight touches of W move Gordon above the catwalk:<br>
this is important because if the distance between Gordon and the floor is too narrow the ragdoll can get stuck.<br>
3-When you’ve place your character 1 mt above the catwalk open the console and input “<span class="bbcode-b">noclip</span>” again(you’ll have as output noclip is now OFF).<br>
4- input “<span class="bbcode-b">sv_cheats 0</span>”</p>
<p>I’d try to do it before Barney starts to talk or after.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah thanks but I don’t think you read my problem, I know how to use noclip. The game crashes before I even reach the section with Barney. The first train section works, it gets to the first loading screen just after the voiceover lady mentions the temperature is 68 degrees or whatever and then after the loading (loading screens are normal I know) I get teleported way above the level and unable to move, even when using noclip.</p>
<p>TehBoxNoob-</p>
<p>Thanks, I have tried from several different servers, but if it is corrupt files then I guess there is not much else I can do but keep trying to re-download and install I guess. Is there any way to check the files are corrupt other than trying to play and getting crash at the same place again?</p>
<p>tried re-installing, deleteing, restarting, reinstalling again. Tried the torrent version of the file over the other download versions. Still getting the exact same problem!</p>

Also is your game folder called  ‘BMS’ and not ‘Black Mesa Sourse’. Also as stated above it might be where you downloaded the files.</p>

<p>It seems you got corrupt files I think.<br>
If thats the case, use another mirror (from <a href="http://release.blackmesasource.com" rel="nofollow noopener">release.blackmesasource.com</a>) or use Winrar to see if there are files corrupt.<br>
I think I also see material errors.</p>

            <p>I tried all that, but doing noclip once it crashes doesn’t do anything</p>
<p>I checked to see if I was doing it right by doing a noclip during the first train sequence, and I could noclip and fly around the world fine then, but not once it loaded and crashed to that view.</p>
<p>I did go into the console and catch the stream of words saying what it was doing though, starting from when I restarted the last time I crashed</p>

            <p>Try going into the developer console and noclipping back to your tram. If you don’t know how, just go into “options”, then keyboard, then advanced, and check enable developer console. Then, press the “~” key to open the console if you are using an American keyboard. If you are using a European one, or something like a Dvorak keyboard, then it should be the key under Esc, but it may not be “~”. Anyways, type in “sv_cheats 1” without the quotes then type in “noclip” without the quotes. Close the console. The noclip disables gravity and collision so you could possibly move back to your tram. Just move around until you find your tram, get inside, and type in noclip in the console again, and continue with your game. If you can’t understand what I just typed, I’m sorry, and send me a PM if you need further help.</p>

            <p>ok the bug still there and is not going away now. I have taken a screenshot and posted below.</p>
<p>As soon as the train rounds the first corner involving a loading period, it jumps me to this point which seems to be high above the valley you pass through on the train in the next zone. except there is no way to move or look around and the plants are in the black sky.</p>
<p>Also now having seen this several times the view does change  depending on what direction you are looking in at the moment the loading bit appears, you can end up looking at different ends of the valley, but the result of not being able to move is the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ok  seem to have fixed it now, after re-installing everything and I also found I had that windows update problem in one of the stickies (I did search for that, I misspelled it first time!). After removing that I still get a very long wait on a loading screen at the same point, but I do advance to the next part and can actually play now!</p>
<p>After going through the rest of the tram level I can see that I actually seemed to teleport to the other side of the level in the middle of the sky so I could see the whole area but with plants floating in weird places.</p>

            <p>So I have just installed Black Mesa, tried to play it through steam, and cannot get further than about 30 seconds into the train sequence!</p>
<p>I can start the train sequence fine, it runs for about 30 seconds, the automated voice tells me about the topside temperature and that the facility is kept at 62 degrees or whatever, then as soon as the train rounds the next corner I get a loading screen and it teleports me to the middle of an outdoor valley with plants and cacti in the sky and what looks like the underground facility floating just off the end of the valley to the right. I cannot move around or do anything exept open and close the menu. I have tried restarting steam several times, and made sure I had the Source SDK base downloaded but I cannot get past the train no matter how I try!</p>
