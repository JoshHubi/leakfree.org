    <title>Arx - End of Sun (Arx Fatalis prequel)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/arx-end-of-sun-arx-fatalis-prequel/8424</link>
    <description>Just found this awesome looking Doom 3 mod that creates a prequel to Arx Fatalis (which is also great, play it if you haven&#39;t already). They even written permission from Zenimax/Arkane, so there won&#39;t be any cease and desist bullshit. Looks like these guys have their shit together.

Apparently they&#39;re now working with The Dark Mod to get some asset swapping going, so I suspect that will cut a lot of their dev time out. I hope.</description>
