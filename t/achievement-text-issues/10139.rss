    <description>I couldn&#39;t find a Thread talking about Achievement issues (even though I know they exist), so I thought I&#39;d make my own. I didn&#39;t even know that achievements existed until today, I never get any notifications upon getting an achievement, but when I opened the achievement windo from the main menu I saw that I did have 4 achievement&#39;s however none of the text will show up for me, I see all the images and I can see the ones I have unlocked, but I have know idea what most of them are for, anyone else having this issue?</description>

<p>Well, there’s a sticky post at the top of the every forum section stating that the folder name must be BMS. And you got it installed just like that if you use the default installer settings.</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, you’ve got some extra fonts installed on your system (including ones that had come with Photoshop CS5) but your brother experience the same problem with achievements menu lacking text but he hasn’t got any non-default fonts installed on his system. Am I right?</p>
<p>Because from what I see the problem looks like a font selection related problem which is not a new thing for source-based games - times ago there were a lot of problems with crosshair and subtitles display in HL2 and Portal for people having Russian version of Windows XP installed coupled with Adobe Illustrator (CS, CS2 or CS3 - don’t remember what version was most popular at those days).</p>
<p>As far as I could tell game expects to find and use Trebuchet MS font for achivement notifications (referenced by BMS\resource\ui\AchievementNotification.res as “AchievementNotification”, defined in BMS\resource\ClientScheme.res in Fonts section). For Achievements Dialog it references “AchievementItemDescription” font but there are no definition for it in ClientScheme.res (thus I think that it either is defined elsewhere - for example as a part of the SDK itself - of simply left to be fallback into default font). I am not a big expert in Source SDK but I suspect that most of the vgui-related stuff had actually been compiled into client.dll (and execuing “strings client.dll | less” in Cygwin kind-of confirms it - there are things like “TrebuchetXX” from ClientScheme.res in there) so it couldn’t be easily fixed by editing ClientScheme.res and/or AchievementsDialog.res files. But this could give you a hint what to look for on your systems, i.e.: check that you have proper versions of fonts installed for all fonts referenced in ClientScheme.res.</p>

<p>Please elaborate on your system software details a bit more. What is your OS? Is it 32bit of 64bit? What is the default locale (language of the system messages and dialogs) you are using? What is the language you have set as a default for Steam? Do you have any non-default truetype/opentype/type1 fonts installed in your system? Do you have something like Adobe Master Collection or Corel Draw design suite installed?</p>
