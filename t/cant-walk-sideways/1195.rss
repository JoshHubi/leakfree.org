    <title>Can&#39;t walk sideways</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-walk-sideways/1195</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always had this. It happens sometimes. Sometimes it&#39;s fine.
But often in First Person shooters [Half Life, Crysis], I suddenly can&#39;t walk sideways anymore. 
I can strafe. But when I press W+A or D, it completely ignores the W and starts strafing. So for some reason it doesn&#39;t respond to the W anymore when I press another button.
This is especially annoying when in a vehicle, since I can&#39;t accelarate and steer at the same time anymore.

Anybody know what can be causing this?
I&#39;ve notices it sometimes happens halfway through when playing. Never catch on quick enough to have an idea what&#39;s causing it though. Maybe some key combination?</description>

<p>To be honest, the more you spend on a keyboard, the better quality it will be, and gaming keyboards are generally pretty high quality. Sure they have a shitton of extra stupid features, but I know my keyboard has a very nice feel to it. I spent $60 on this ‘gaming’ keyboard, and I love it way more then any other keyboard I’ve used. Sure there are the zillion extra keys that I can assign to do certain macros if I want to, but I never do (aside from pause, shuffle and next/prev song and volume knob).</p>

            <p>The keyboard is fine, as Imonfire says. It only does this in certain games.<br>
It never did it in World of Warcraft for example.</p>
<p>But I guess I’ll try another keyboard we got lyin around, see what happens.</p>

            <p>Well, W + A is just two keys. And it works like 50% of the time. And then suddenly I can’t anymore. I really do think it’s nothing to do with the keyboard.<br>
I never had this on my old pc with the same keyboard.</p>
