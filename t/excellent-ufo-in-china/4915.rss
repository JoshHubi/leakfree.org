    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/excellent-ufo-in-china/4915</link>
    <description>Evidently this caused a major airport in China to be shut down. The photos of the phenomenon are unusually clear and distinct. The Chinese government claims it has identified the phenomenon but can&#39;t release the information because it has &quot;a military connection.&quot;

<p>lol, i don’t think what i said counts as “spewing scientific sounding words,”.

<p>^this, bscly.</p>
<p>There’s also the increase in communication and reported incidents, as well as government denial and thus public interest. To illustrate the first point, figures show that crime in South Africa is increasing, though this is not the case. Crime is actually falling, but the percentage of reported incidents is climbing more rapidly. Or something.</p>

</aside>
<p>So, what you’re implying is that humans instinctively project the idea of “alien spacecraft” onto any random visual stimuli in the sky…The question of “why” this is the case is just as interesting to me if not moreso than any “evidence” that appears of specific phenomenon. The question of why incidences are consistently increasing &amp; tend to happen in groups is also interesting, although the answer could be as simple as “there is more flying shit”</p>

            <p>I saw yesterday half of a documentary in Discovery Channel. One of the guys that work for the channel decided to release some balloons, they were tied together but they moved more or less freely so, at a distance, it looked like an object that was constantly changing its shape. The balloons ended up on Youtube with some funny comments like “Wow, these aliens have an incredible technology!”</p>
<p>There was also a light seen somewhere in Mexico that turned out to be a short-circuit caused by a tree with a high-voltage line. It surprises me when people see some lights and already assume it is an UFO, come on, it could be anything: a plane, a helicopter, a natural sky phenomena (electrical or something), a remote-control toy of any sort or even someone trying to trick you with edited pics.</p>

<p>First of all, it never showed up on radar, (most video descriptions mention it not showing up on radar) second of all, the photos and the video are of two different things, the photos are just a time lapse of an airplane (just like timelapse pics of cities where the cars form long ass light trails) and the video is a missile or it could be iron man</p>

<p>and also, marsh gas, and the light from venus reflecting off the upper atmosphere… plus there was a high-altitude flock of birds also reflecting sunlight… and a weather balloon. nothing to see here, folks.</p>

<p>In other words: bullshit conspiracy theories from desperate attention seekers who spew scientific words from their favorite sci-fi books/unproved wild scientific theories to sound authentic.</p>

<p>Mattemuse, I don’t know if you are being ironic, but you can’t prove that the UFO is in fact an alien spacecraft if that is your intention. The chances of it being an alien craft are slim beyond compare, and reaching this galaxy from the closest neighbouring one is a feat not to be taken lightly.</p>
