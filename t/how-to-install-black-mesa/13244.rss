    <title>How to install Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-install-black-mesa/13244</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen numerous recipes to try and install Black Mesa (I had to search too since it wasn&#39;t working). Here&#39;s what did the job for me, where other recipes didn&#39;t.

1) Launch Steam and install, in Library/Tools, &quot;Source SDK Base 2007&quot;. This takes a little less than 4 GB on the disk.

2) Download the [i]BlackMesa.7z[/i] file.

You can download the installer as well and try to run it but here it failed, probably because Steam has changed (I&#39;m not sure this project is still on), and also because it wasn&#39;t uncompressing the .7z archive. So in this case you can simply follow the next steps.

3) Uncompress it into [i]&lt;Steam directory&gt;\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS[/i], so it looks like this:

&lt;Steam directory&gt;\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS\BlackMesa\bin\
&lt;Steam directory&gt;\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS\BlackMesa\cfg\
...

4) Create a shortcut.

For example, if your Steam directory is [i]D:\games\Steam[/i], the shortcut target should be:

[i]D:\games\Steam\Steam.exe -applaunch 218 -game &quot;d:\games\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS\BlackMesa&quot;[/i]

You don&#39;t need to see it in the Steam library, I doubt that these days it&#39;s still possible to make it appear there anyway.

5) Launch the game from the shortcut. 

HTH. Have fun!</description>

<p>But for what it is worth, I updated the wiki to offer exact links to the files on gamefront.<br>

            <p>Assuming you downloaded the mod correctly, you should have:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">BlackMesa.7z<br>
BlackMesa.md5<br>
BlackMesa-Setup.exe</span></p>
<p>BlackMesa-Setup is all you need to touch, as it automatically decompresses the .7z into the right directory.</p>

<p>Not really, no. If it were the case, it’d been much easier and I wouldn’t post this  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Install Black Mesa<br>
Click the file blackmesa-setup.exe to start the installation process. Be sure the game is installed to this directory: \Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS</li>
<li>Launch Steam and find the game “Black Mesa” listed in your game’s “Library”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As I said, the setup only puts a .7z and it has to be decompressed manually (maybe it depends on where one downloads it). And Black Mesa isn’t listed in the Library, or at least not for many people.</p>
