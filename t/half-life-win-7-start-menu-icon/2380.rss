    <title>Half life Win 7 start menu icon</title>

    <description>Not exactly to show off but I did sorta toss together this Half life icon as a replacement Windows 7 start button.

It has full instructions. It is a bit of work to do this. But if you want to mess around more with W7 start menu buttons this is a start.

I noticed that *take ownership* part took me quite a while.

I also have some more forthcoming icons but some have problems like the HL2 one which doesn&#39;t quite fit exactly so part of the *2* is discoloured but I might just throw it out there anyways for someone more skilled to figure it out ;D</description>

            <p>Your feedback is welcome. The logo originally had a narrow orange border around it but when I lit them up most of it disappeared but you can see some at the bottom of each icon.  I left it in intentionally but if everyone thinks it’s better left out I can do that. Also welcome to modify this as you see fit, I woudl like to see improvements upon this.</p>
