    <description>[url]https://www.gamespot.com/news/6286666.html[/url]

So the new Call of Duty game isn&#39;t going to take place in space, I was so looking forward to it.  Also I searched and the closest thread I found was: [url]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=4140&amp;highlight=Modern+Warfare[/url]

I was a little disappointed in the fact it wasn&#39;t going to take place in space, since I would like to see how they were going to work out the story on that one.

Do you like this approach of having 3 different companies making the game and would you rather have it take place in space?  Discuss.</description>

            <p>So what’s your point. What you say is still an opinion, nothing more. Stop presenting it as fact.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s more than “I liked more than x”. If what you say is true, then it’s impossible to have even the slightest be accurate a game review. Admittedly, the big reviewer out there, ign, is pretty shitty, but that’s because it brown noses certain game companies. It comes down to "This is what’s good about X: … and this is what’s bad about x: … Here the cons far outweigh the pros. The only part people should disagree a whole lot on is that final statement of which outweighs which.</p>

<p>I agree. You could easily win that argument. Just prove to me that those who enjoyed say, Halo Reach and ODST more than their prequels didn’t actually enjoy them more and it was all an illusion. Or, alternatively, you could accept that there are people in the world that are not you, and have just as much of a reason to like the games the like that you do to like the games you like, and that no amount of stating opinions as facts can change this.</p>
<p>As to Winged, his post wasn’t in a format that could easily be modified to show my point concisely.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I gave a couple reasons as to why in an earlier post. I would do so, but that would be even more off-topic than we’ve already gotten and I already did so in a Halo Reach thread and it ended in a circle.</p>
<p>Also, in many cases people don’t have just as much reason to like a game as I have to dislike it. Lots of people either don’t know much about the subject (applies to console-pc war more than what game you like) or simply make an opinion based off intuition and can’t provide hard logic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you understand what opinions are? No.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Some opinions are well grounded and some aren’t. An opinion can be wrong in that it can be completely illogical or rely on faulty logic. Contrary to popular belief, an opinion can be logically and intelligently argued; you can give the reasoning behind your opinion and compare it to the reasoning behind the other person’s opinion. If both people’s reasoning is sound and it comes down to personal preference, the argument ends in a stalemate. If one person’s reasoning is shown to be heavily flawed and illogical, the other person wins.</p>
<p>To give an example, someone might say “Coca Cola tastes like shit.” And you say “Why?” It can go two ways. The person may say “Because I don’t like the feel of carbonation in my mouth.” And then it has boiled down to personal preference and the argument is over. However, the person might say “I hate the taste because it has way too much pumpkin juice in it.” Coca Cola does not have any pumpkin juice in it, so although the original statement was nothing more than an opinion, the person is still wrong.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I did not include much reasoning in the quoted post, how ever the person I was replying to did not either so I did not find it necessary to provide reasoning myself. And, on top of that, I have provided reasoning earlier in this thread.</p>
<p>Also, your post seemed to be in defense of Winged One, yet it could have just as easily applied to him as me.</p>
<p>TL;DR: It is you who does not fully understand opinions.</p>

            <p>What I always found funny was that, when MW2 was first announced, most people were like “OMFGZ TIHS WILL BE GREATZZZ!!!1!!!”  Then they announced the lack of dedicated servers and suddenly it was the worst game ever eve before it was released.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who says that Halo and CoD are the worst games ever is a hopeless gaming hipster.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I wouldn’t say they’re the worst, but I don’t particularly like either of them.  Halo can be ok when you get with a group that wants some variety and doesn’t just play Slayer constantly.  CoD, let’s just say I only play it with my friends, otherwise I can’t stand it.</p>
<p>What I really don’t like about either is that they changed the FPS genre in general.  Some things that they’ve done have been for the better, (offhand grenades and melee being the biggest two IMO) but there’s nothing quite like running around with 5 health left looking for a health pickup, trying to stay alive.</p>

            <p>Any Call of Duty after CoD2 just sucked ass. COD4 was all right, but sucked compared to COD2. I feel like the multiplayer is unbalanced as fuck and they’re releasing the same game over and over again with different names.</p>
