    <title>If you were Valve, how would you announce and release HL2:ep3?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/if-you-were-valve-how-would-you-announce-and-release-hl2-ep3/6245</link>
    <description>Here is what I would do:

Step 1: completely finish the game in silence

Step 2: make a teaser trailer simply stating that &quot;Lamarr will be returning.&quot;

Step 3: set the internal release date for a week after E3

Step 4: at E3, make your whole appearance there to show off DOTA 2

Step 5: at the end of E3, casually announce Ep3 is coming out next week

Step 6: watch the ensuing chaos

Step 7: release it a day late

Step 8: success!!!


Whats your ideas?</description>

<p>You mean some people think they should have never made Half Life 2 with the Combine story and all? That’s crazy.</p>

<p>It’s true, I remember the backlash. It was just a little fart of hatred amidst a Class 5 Hurricane of praise, but there were definitely some very vocal whiners who thought Valve had let the franchise down.</p>
<p>I’ve actually been a little disappointed by how afraid Valve has been to do new things with the last two episodes. Episode 2 brought some new elements into play, but I’m going to be very disappointed if the next chapter doesn’t mix it up immensely. HL2 was a totally new experience, I want that feeling again next time.</p>

            <p>I would release it the same day that Black Mesa comes out, just to be a dick and to see how many people download Black Mesa and how many people buy Episode 3.</p>

<p>I bet we will all download BMS only to find out Ep3 was outsourced and made by Raminator. And that there is no BMS. Would be so awesome.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You know, that would actually kinda suck. I’m way more excited about Black Mesa than Episode 3.</p>

            <p>I’d release it and make it only be accessed in two places: Bulgaria and <span class="bbcode-b">SPACE!</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>It would be full of bugs that would be fixed one by one each week. So that it would be impossible to pirate it! <em>evil laugh</em></p>
