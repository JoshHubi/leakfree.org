            <p>Thanks, tried it</p>
<p>still had some particles though, but they vanished faster, so it didn’t lag as much for as long, will experiment</p>

            <p>I don’t really know if adding the following command to your launch options could help in any way, but here you go:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-r_drawparticles 0</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> It turns OFF almost all particles (such as smoke, fire embers, Xen portal effects, etc.).</p>
<p>To enable the particles again, simply remove “-r_drawparticles 0” from the launch options and add “-r_drawparticles 1” (without “”).</p>
<p>Be sure to remove “-r_drawparticles 1” from the launch options, after you started / played the game at least once.</p>
<p>Maybe your framerate goes up to 7 or 9 (not trying to be funny here).  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> [/SIZE]</p>
