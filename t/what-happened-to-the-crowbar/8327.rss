    <description>In Half-Life: Source I mean.  I&#39;m not a genius with modeling or anything but I would like to get into it one day.  But I just can&#39;t put my finger on it.  It seems like the texture has changed but that wouldn&#39;t make any sense because they didn&#39;t do that for anything else in the port.  It looks good though.  But I&#39;ve always wandered what the technical term is for what they did to it.  :smiley:</description>

            <p>I think he wondering what they did to the crowbar model between goldsrc and the Source port of Half-Life. Like specularization, or retexturing.</p>

It seems like the texture has changed but that wouldn’t make any sense because they didn’t do that for anything else in the port.  It looks good though.
