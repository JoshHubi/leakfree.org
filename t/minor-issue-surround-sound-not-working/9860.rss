    <title>[MINOR ISSUE] Surround sound not working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/minor-issue-surround-sound-not-working/9860</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m not sure if the mod is supposed to have 5.1 positional sound, but if it does, it doesn&#39;t seem to be working. Voices and FX are either loud or inaudible, disappearing almost entirely at various angles. These are when the sound should be in the back speakers.

I have a SoundMAX built in audio and I just loaded up Half Life 2 to test the surround and it is working fine. The problem is thus something to do with Black Mesa or the SDK.

The way the error sounds, it interferes with playing. Even when forcing stereo, sounds disappear at certain angles. I don&#39;t wish to play in this state.

Thanks, 

Ubernoodle

EDIT: I have tried using console commands to change the audio speaker config (snd_surround_speakers 5) and the console will report changes for all except 5.1 for which it doesn&#39;t report anything. It will change to others but the sound doesn&#39;t change. The GUI menu ALWAYS says 5.1 after closing it and opening it again. I have also tried &#39;snd_digital_surround 1&#39; but the console reports no such command. It will respond with success to &#39;snd_legacy_surround 1&#39;, but that&#39;s not what I need.</description>

            <p>Well, what I did was force it to stereo by changing windows to stereo. I then can use my sound card hardware to fill out the stereo sound to the other speakers (I hate playing when only two are running). When stereo is forced in this way, all problems about angles, weird mixing and vanishing sounds are gone. But it’s not surround. I can live with it, but it’s a pity.</p>
<p>Also, as mentioned above, it seems as if the ‘virtual speaker sources’ in the game world are off. Voices to the right were far softer than when on the left. Other voices followed me everywhere I went.</p>

<p>That’s the exact opposite of what I’m dealing with in 5.1 — too loud when you’re looking at it and it practically disappears when you look away.</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem, as it seems to think that I have surround sound enabled even though I don’t.  If I’m looking directly at a sound source I can barely hear it, but if I turn so that the source is at the edge of the screen, I can hear it perfectly.</p>

            <p>That’s more a Source engine thing. I had the exact same problem in Half-Life 2. Never could figure out how to fix it, and it sort of went away on its own in newer Source releases.</p>

            <p>It definitely supports 5.1, as I am using it.</p>
<p>However, I do notice the mix levels are way off – the center speaker volume is much higher compared to the other speakers, causing things to be very loud when looking straight at them, and then quiet when you look away.  It sounds similar to your problem.</p>
<p>Make sure your windows sound is set to 5.1 and the SoundMax control panel (if there is such a thing) is set to 5.1 – and if there is an individual speaker calibration, check that and make sure your speaker volumes are normalized.</p>
<p>Sucks to not have surround, hope you get it figured out.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue with stereo.  I never tried surround.  You have to be facing in just the right direction to hear any speech.  It doesn’t matter what NPC is talking  or the location.</p>
