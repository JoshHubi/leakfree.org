    <title>New dificult level mod &quot;Invasion&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-dificult-level-mod-invasion/62803</link>
    <description>Hello  , 

I want to make a new mod but i have a problem , i have absolute no idea where to start.
Meaby i can get some tips to get started?
I all i want to do in this mod is add more alien enemies to every single encounter , when a headcrab appears this mod will make it so that 3-5 will appear , same with all alien veriants.  Human soldiers ,APCs, tanks , helis and bosses will remain the same with no change.

I really like killing aliens in this game i completed this game in hard 100 times and by now i finish all fights with alot of healths ammo (i do back track alot). So , instad of just making Gordon guns do less dmg or increase the HP of enemies i just want to incerse the amount of spawns.

So a few questions, 

- How do i add more enemies to the existing maps in blackmesa?
- What app do i need to open the levels , so i can modifie them?
- What comands do i use to spawn new enemies? , also the comand to spawn new enemies with the teleport animation :slight_smile:

im new at modding so i have absolute no idea where to start ,  i was guessing asking here for tips  wile i google  this will be nice :smile:

anyway , thank you!!</description>

            <p>Enemy teleports are part of the level logic themselves; in order to make more of them spawn you will need to open up each map and edit it directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpack bms_maps_dir.vpk by dragging it over vpk.exe</li>
<li><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/t/decompiling-black-mesa-maps/15217/14" rel="nofollow noopener">Decompile the maps</a></li>
<li>Open them in Hammer.exe</li>
</ul>
