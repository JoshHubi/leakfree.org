    <description>I want to get a satellite radio and subscription but there&#39;s so many radios out there and they all have their fair share of good and bad reviews, which is making it really difficult to pick one. The Sirius brand ones seem to be consistently better but their subscription doesn&#39;t have the folk channel like XM and SiriusXM subscriptions do  :frowning:  .

Anyone have satellite radio and can help me out with this?</description>

            <p>I was more looking for suggestions for specific radios. More specifically, ones that you don’t have to replace your current car radio with.</p>

            <p>I have SiriusXM. It’s pretty damned good. There’s a ton of variety. I mostly listen to the comedy channel, but the music ones are pretty good, too, when I’m not in the mood to listen to a 80+ year old hag try and crack jokes.</p>
<p>Although, the thing that annoys me, is whenever you go under an overpass. You loose signal for as long as you are under that damned thing. Although, the same could be said for typical AM/FM radio.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Overall, though, it’s a damned good service and I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
