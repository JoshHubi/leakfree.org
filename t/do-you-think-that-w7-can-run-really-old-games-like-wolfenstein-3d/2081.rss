            <p>I use Z-Doom to play my Doom games.</p>
<p>I just don’t know about Wolfenstein. But yeah, I’ll try DOSbox when I get the computer.</p>

            <p>Full screen DOS apps (Doom, Quake, Dark Forces, Wolfenstein, etc) don’t work in vista, and they probably won’t work in 7 either. Just use DOSbox, it’s what you should be using to play dos games, even in XP.</p>

            <p>I think Windows 7 is pretty much going to run a lot of old games. The only thing I’ve had problems with is things like ‘The 3D Gamemaker’ which I have to extract the files from the disc myself to get it to work, Because it doesn’t like the .exe anymore.</p>

            <p>Well I can play all old games.<br>
If it works in vista it will work in 7. Also if you have win7 ultimate ( and a couple others that aren’t home ) you can do windows XP virtual machine, and run it under the windows XP environment.<br>
Failing that there is always boot disks etc…there is ways to get most anything to work. Win7 won’t change  things, and it might even make it easier on you.</p>
