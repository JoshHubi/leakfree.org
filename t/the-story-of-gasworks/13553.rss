    <title>The Story of Gasworks</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-story-of-gasworks/13553</link>
    <description>Greetings, community!

My name is Chon Kemp, one of the new level designers on Black Mesa. Those of you who know me, may know me as Text FAMGUY1, or the guy who made the Uncut stuff for Black Mesa. I was brought on to help with Black Mesa&#39;s multiplayer. The majority of my work since joining the team has been in 3 primary areas: Gasworks, Lambdabunker, and MP testing. 

I am starting up a little community dev blog, for those of you who are interested. Let me explain to you how this is hopefully going to work.

This dev blog will be a detailed account of the entire development of the multiplayer map Gasworks, from start to its current state. Each chapter will examine a specific iteration of the map, and each chapter is broken down into two parts/posts. My aim is to post a part a week. One part of a chapter will look at the story behind the iteration, and will talk about the story of the team, myself, and the decisions/mistakes I made on that iteration, as well as some positives. The second part of each chapter will then examine and explain an element of the design theory which I outlined in the previous post, and how it applies. One part on story, one part on design theory. Something like maybe 10 chapters overall. A bit of fun, a bit of story, a bit of learning. A fairly personal story. The idea is to show you guys the amount of work and failure that goes into a Black Mesa map.

Unfortunately, this is also me you&#39;re dealing with. I have a lot of trouble writing concisely. I write a lot. Sorry! I just can&#39;t help it. I hope some of you find the strength to read through it.

[b]RULES/DISCLAIMER[/b][/SIZE]

[b][u]Breaking these rules will result in infractions, bans, rejections, ejections, and if you push me too far, I&#39;ll come round to your house give you a little whack with a crowbar.[/u][/b]

Very importantly, any images which I post in this thread are ABSOLUTELY NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT. The majority of what I&#39;m going to post here are from very early development versions which were scrapped and redone, from scratch, because they were not good enough. NOTHING you see here represents how Gasworks, or Black Mesa currently looks. Do not judge the game based on what I post here. If images or topics from this thread start getting circulated, with people saying: &quot;look how awful Black Mesa MP looks!&quot; then I will stop doing these entirely. This is the top rule for these blog posts.

This is a personal dev blog, and is not sanctioned by the Black Mesa team. My views, design abilities and comments do not reflect that of the dev team.

Please stay on topic. I will happily answer questions and chat, but I won&#39;t answer questions unrelated to my current posts. I am going through the map&#39;s development chronologically. We will get to current versions, eventually.

Also, don&#39;t be mean. As the least experienced level designer on the team, I have learned incredible amounts over the course of my time here, and vastly improved my abilities. I&#39;m aiming, here, to outline the mistakes and process that led me to this stage. Comment on my mistakes and problems, and give thoughts, by all means, but if people start to be cruel or nasty, they will get infractions. We&#39;re only human.

<p>Just an update for those of you keeping up.</p>
<p>I’m probably scratching the “part 2” of each chapter, and will only focus on the iterations now, probably fortnightly, and probably in a fair bit less detail. I enjoyed writing the first part but it was more than half a day’s work, and it really didn’t get the response/attention I would have liked. Too much work!</p>
<p>Brian’s threads seem to be more what you guys are after, which is cool. It’s stuff you’re familiar with, after all!</p>
<p>Excepting my own rule, I’ll probably post the next chapter in a few days, as I had mostly already written it.</p>

<p>D’awww…</p>
<p>Coming into mapping from a weird place (using Hammer as a sort of architectural CAD program and building maps to function like real-world buildings), I’m finding these blogs incredibly interesting from the perspective of how to make maps that aren’t just pretty, but actually mechanically playable as well.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Let me share some of my Half-Life 1 Deathmatch memories:</p>
<p>When we had clanwar on Gasworks we played 3vs3 and mostly tried to cover one area… the upper area was the advantaged one because there was more armor, 2 gauss and a crossbow… So when we all died and spawned underground we had to take time to stack us with weapons again… After that we planned to attack the surface with different routes. So I think it’s nice to have these two areas cut from each other… because they are like 2 bases… which you could defend or attack.</p>
<p>About camping in Half-Life:</p>
<p>The Crossbow is meant to be a camper weapon. It doesn’t make any sound over distance and is really effective. Your enemies won’t know from where you are shooting on them… That’s the big strength of the crossbow and I hope you’ll keep that aspect in BM. The crossbow is mainly used for camping, spawnkilling and small boosts (crossbow-jumps with primary fire… but they work best when you don’t have armor).</p>
<p>Nice to see some news about Multiplayer… I’m waiting for it so much. I hope Multiplayer will be as classic and faithful as it can be (modern graphics but fast paced oldschool-gameplay). Another important thing for me is the netcode. The netcode pretty much sucked in HL2DM. In HL1 they patched it and it is better now… But I know it could be even greater. Also I hope you will balance the egon for multiplayer. I suggest you remove headshot-multiplicator for egon-damage and make egon work more like QuakeLive-Lightninggun (high dps, limited range, great precision). Egon can and should be a strong gun but you have to place it in your maps with map-balance in mind (2 Egons on crossfire are too many + Headshot damage is ridiculous).</p>
<p>I am really happy to see some Multiplayer news. Keep it up please!</p>
<p>PS: Please add competetive 1on1 and 3on3 TDM (Red vs. Blue or Helmets vs. Recons) matchmaking to Black Mesa. Also it would be really nice to have a pogo-jump-key for bunnyhopping (atleast optional…) and Gauss splashdamage through walls / edges (it was widely used in HL1DM and an important feature to maintain mapcontrol… In singleplayer mode the scientist even demonstrated it’s wallbanging capabilities). Also… You can’t compare CS:GO mapping to any kind of Deathmatch-mapping. These are two totally different pairs of shoes 8)</p>

            <p>I do enjoy these updates. I was trying to re-create an old Half Life map for in CS:GO, I failed and I may take your advice for for remaking the map again though.</p>

            <p>Thanks for these updates, Text; they’re a great look into into an actual development project. As a beginning mapper myself, these sources of insight are great for the overall design of a project.</p>
<p>There’s another mapper that I follow, albeit for CS:GO, that does mapping  stuff similar to what you’re doing here. If anyone is interested- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InmG615IgaA&amp;list=PLfwtcDG7LpxG5QsLnW8FnuQXIVcIOOG0Y" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">link</a></p>

<p>Another thing I’d like to point out, which I’m sure is obvious for someone who’s trying to remake these maps, is how utterly ridiculous the old Deathmatch maps are. Half-Life’s Black Mesa is a shining example of OSHA compliance compared to maps like Undertow and Gasworks. It’s a twisted, sealed labyrinth, and that’s not what you want in a map styled after BMS. There have to be changes just to allow the environment to make a little more sense.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We’re well aware of that - it has been a prime consideration for us. Some parts of Gasworks I have absolutely agonized over to try and make sense.</p>
<p>The thing about the HL1DM maps is that, not only were they generally very hastily designed, they also never really had much of a purpose ascribed to them - a byproduct of the basically nonexistent detailing. So yes, as you said, just a twisted labyrinth. We’ve tried very hard to give the areas a clear visual purpose that makes sense - but at the end of the day - gameplay is king.</p>
<p>Most of Gasworks is the same, layout wise - except I’ve tried to give each area a clear visual purpose, and it works, for the most part. It’s still weirdly laid out if you think about it - but none of us are willing to change the layout and hurt gameplay to benefit an area making sense. It’s a delicate balance.</p>

<p>What’s an example of this balance, if you can share? I’m a bit curious now.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can’t really give a specific example of the balance, as it really depends on the map, number of players, etc. That’s one of the things you have to determine as the map evolves, and based on the layout of the area.</p>
<p>Basically, if a player has a hard time knowing where they’re getting shot from, or how to get somewhere, it’s a bad thing. One of the things you’ll notice about Gasworks is that, even on the big outdoor area with loads of angles and spaces - you pretty much always know where you’re getting shot from, and are aware of the route to navigate to that position if necessary. If there are too many routes to one place, it becomes a crapshoot. This was a particular problem for me with early iterations of the RPG Fort - I didn’t like the fort aspect so I kept adding new ways to get up (climbing up barrels, elevators, staircases, etc). It just got really annoying for any player camping up there, because they never knew where they were going to get attacked from.</p>
<p>There’s strictly no correct answer, but in BMS we’ve gone for simple basic layouts with optional nuance. You can still do just fine if you ignore all the little things and tricks in our layouts, but knowing them helps. It’s when a map ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES you to know all that complex stuff and a million routes that it can be an issue, but again, depends on the map.</p>

<p>Heh, that’s true, CS and BM <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> M are two completely different beasts after all. Same goes for Fortress Forever vs TF2.</p>
<p>What’s an example of this balance, if you can share? I’m a bit curious now.</p>

            <p>Another thing I’d like to point out, which I’m sure is obvious for someone who’s trying to remake these maps, is how utterly ridiculous the old Deathmatch maps are. Half-Life’s Black Mesa is a shining example of OSHA compliance compared to maps like Undertow and Gasworks. It’s a twisted, sealed labyrinth, and that’s not what you want in a map styled after BMS. There have to be changes just to allow the environment to make a little more sense.</p>

<p>It’s hard to write a development dev blog without a bit of retrospect and hindsight - and I didn’t think there was enough material to be interesting when I started out. I have a lot to say now - it’s just a question of whether people want to hear it or not. That’s why I’m doing it now - I have the material!</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing more of your stuff (if you decide to put more out), it looks really good. I vaguely remember playing Gasworks in OP4, it was one of my favorites when I did play DM.</p>
<p>I have a question actually, considering your history that you discussed in your last two projects before joining the team: the one about developing maps for MP in some game, I believe it was Counter-Strike; don’t hold me to that.</p>
<p>Has that past played a factor in your development of Gasworks in addition to your debut projects for Black Mesa (OAR:U and ST:U)?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I never really considered my work on Counter-Strike to be any real experience with actual, proper level design. It was more me acquainting myself with the Source tools. I only ever designed I think…3 finished maps, which I mostly played with my friends when we played on my server. I never made conventional CS maps, either.</p>
<p>In fact, it was this fact which came back to bite me a little bit - so you could actually say it did influence my development of Gasworks, negatively. One of the key features of all the CS maps I made was that they featured a huge variety of OPTIONS for the player, at any one time. They were not conventional CS maps, in this regard. I loved having random stuff everywhere you could climb up, loads of little jumps, tricks and pipes you could walk across, shortcuts, hidden routes, the works. I was all about cramming as much complexity into my maps as possible - not because I thought it was good design or anything like that, but because it was fun and not like every other CS map out there! The problem with that is - it’s conducive to fairly sloppy and chaotic gameplay - which is fine when you’re playing a fun map with friends, but trying to design a professional product? Not so much!</p>
<p>I was guilty of doing this in early versions of Gasworks. Not the initial one I just talked about, but some of the versions after that. I started putting in lots of trick jumps, new routes, props you can climb on - things like that, and it made the gameplay sloppy and chaotic. In a fast paced game like Black Mesa, you need to find a very difficult balance between limiting the player and giving them options. Being too limited is obviously boring - but having too many options creates chaotic and confusing gameplay. We have a good idea of this balance now.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter how the original was - we want all of our maps to be as gorgeous as possible! It’s tricky to pull off as we’ve gone for a fairly minimalist aesthetic in the name of uncluttered and smooth gameplay - making it look good and play great is very tough. We’ve tried super hard to make it look good and simultaneously uncluttered - a very difficult balance to strike indeed.</p>

<p>Orange Mapping has always been stomething I’ve had trouble with too, beeing a total noob at mapping. I always start trying to texture it and stuff waaay too early.</p>

            <p>This was a good read. It’s really interesting to have insight into the process behind making a multi-player map in a game like black mesa. I’ve worked on mp maps in the past for other games and it’s a completely different experience from single player. It can be difficult to predict how others are going to play the map versus what you intended or imagined would happen. Looking forward to more chapters and I can’t wait<em>edit</em> to play BMDM. Thanks for taking the time to write these.</p>

<p>I think that’s probably because you just don’t remember it so well. My iteration actually resembled the original a lot, even if it didn’t dimensionally match it properly.</p>

<p>First of all, thanks for getting in touch with the community again <em>digital hug</em></p>
<p>I like these DevBlogs, gives some interesting insights and I can only begin to glimpse what going through an MP map without a proper planning can be pretty  challenging.</p>
<p>I remember my first mapping hours with a few friends (I was and am still a total amateur and stopped mapping at all) and we made two maps for Counter-Strike, with the different approaches you talked about: The first was, we wanted to make a new rats map, so we just threw different ideas into the room, designing it, started mapping, outlining, etc. and then got to play it. It sucked. For the other map on the other hand, we first laid out our concept and didn’t care about the visuals at all, so we just wanted to test it on a LAN-party with some friends and while it was looking pretty awful with also only placeholder textures and so on, the map became quickly a favorite at playing (mind you, still they were pretty baaad maps in terms of almost everything).</p>
<p>I don’t think that it’s a disadvantage to have a more “hands-on” approach like you described, I just guess it was the wrong decision for this particular project, not in general. If I remember correctly, your approach for the Uncut-Maps was also more of an “hands-on”  without so much planning and it changed as you played it, tested it and went through many iterations. But look where that got you ! More streamlined, visually and gameplay-wise really great additions to the Singleplayer in my opinion that design-wise even top the main game !</p>
<p>By the way, stories like these we right now would be PERFECTLY suited for any kind of developer commentary… Well, not those things you and Brian for example talked about already on the Dev-Blogs, but maybe other things ? (I’m still hoping and crossing fingers for an developer commentary, even if that means BM is coming out in 2017 or something  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>

<p>Nice points. Generally speaking - your story is why orange maps are so useful. Very often the visual direction of a map is VERY closely related to its layout. Starting with the visual direction and layout at the same time often ties you down too much - rather than you creating the layout and then planning out a solid visual direction. This is again, the mistake in not orange mapping. The two should be considered separately, even if they’re very closely related - at least in the early stages.</p>
<p>As for the whole “hands-on” stuff, I would say it’s still generally a bad thing when trying to create a professional finished product in decent time. My “hands on” approach with that stuff only worked out okay because I was spitballing and changing ideas with the community constantly as I went along (which WAS AWESOME, by the way). But on a dev team that’s really something you want to do earlier on - especially when you’re tied into other artists and developers. Changing direction on a team is a bad thing - assets have to be redone, textures have to be changed, which can be a big motivation killer, particularly on a large project such as Black Mesa where everyone as very limited time to begin with. It really didn’t matter much, on my own.</p>
<p>As for the whole “topping the main game” stuff about Uncut, that’s not true, I’m afraid. On an objective level my stuff just isn’t as good, in pretty much any way. I can quite clearly see that now, especially with a lot more experience behind me and lessons learned. I could do an outrageously better job now. Will never have the time, though.</p>
<p>If I decide to continue these stories (may not), you’ll see what happens once I find a proper direction and plan. Everything changes.</p>
