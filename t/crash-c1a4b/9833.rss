    <title>Crash - C1a4b</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-c1a4b/9833</link>
    <description>Keep getting this crash when the screen shakes as you come up to the scientist who is sitting against the wall after killing the headcrab zombie after the door inside the silo opens up. Tried setting everything to low and still getting the crash. Just shows up as a normal &quot;hl2.exe has stopped working&quot;.

            <p>bump. anyone have an idea?</p>
<p>edit: Have also tried noclipping around it and still it crashes. Kinda sucks to wait all this time to have this kinda crash happen again and again and then not even have a post acknowledge that my post has been read and is being looked into by the team. :\</p>
