    <title>I increased the graphs at most, now the game does not work.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-increased-the-graphs-at-most-now-the-game-does-not-work/14857</link>
    <description>Please I need help, I set the game to work with a graphic much better, I was testing, but now I can not return to the factory settings. The game starts to load, but suddenly it turns off.

I&#39;ve tried to restore my OS.
I&#39;ve tried to uninstall the game and install again.

Maybe I could change the settings outside the game?
Changing some value for the OS regedit ?
In some main game folder could change the values?

I WANT VERY RESTORE DEFAULTS OF GRAPH SETTINGS, HELP ME PLESE!!!!!!</description>

            <p>Tidy<br>
Unfortunately I did not follow your advices, I did download a beta version. This solved my problem, because it comes with the standards of manufacture.</p>
<p>Even so thanks for the help !!! &lt;3  &lt;3  &lt;3</p>

            <p>If you re-enable Steam Cloud again later, it’s possible that Steam will restore the non-working config.cfg again.</p>
<p>Alternatively, try this:</p>
<p>Right click on Black Mesa in your Steam Library and click “Properties”. Then under “General” click “Set Launch Options” and add the following to the launch options: [tt]-autoconfig[/tt]</p>
<p>If the game launches successfully, then go into the Options menu -&gt; Video and check the video settings and change/lower the advanced settings to what they were when the game worked (tips: set Cascade Shadow Map to a lower setting or disable it, or set Shadow Detail to medium).</p>
<p>If [tt]-autoconfig[/tt] doesn’t work, then add [tt]-dev[/tt] to the options and try again.</p>
<p>After you’re done changing the video settings, exit the game and remove [tt]-autoconfig[/tt] (and [tt]-dev[/tt]) from the launch options. Hopefully, the game should continue to work the next time you launch the game.</p>
