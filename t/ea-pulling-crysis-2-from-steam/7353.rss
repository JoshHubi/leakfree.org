    <description>Am i the only one deeply offended by EA pulling Crysis 2 from Steam?

That isn&#39;t fair play is it?

If they&#39;d like to publish new titles on their own platform that&#39;s ok.

But taking back a game they have already published to Steam is just... Stupid.

What do you think?

<p>Yet you were still unable to read. It didn’t say they were pulled because they were on a different download platform. It said they were pulled because they broke the contract somehow. Steam games can be on other download platforms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Valve may have decided to pull the plug, but EA cannot claim that they did nothing to provoke its removal of Crysis 2 from steam. EA knew of the rules and didn’t care. They probably wanted to include something in Crysis 2 that required some sort of interaction with Origin, something that Valve just could not agree too. Valve has had similar things happen with titles that require steam. Other digital distribution sources have refused to carry titles that use Steamworks.</p>
<p>But we won’t know what’s happened until someone talks about it in more detail.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just to clarify the situation, it isn’t that EA didn’t care. Valve released the new terms after Crysis 2 became available on steam. Because Crytek had an agreement with another digital distributor before the new terms were applied, they were in direct violation of the new terms.</p>

            <p>EA said that Crysis 2 was pulled by Steam because of a change in its terms of service “many of which are not imposed by other online game services” Any ideas what terms would possibly force them to pull it?</p>

            <p>so what I’m reading is, you can’t buy Crysis 2 on steam because there’s competition?<br>
that would be like if Wal-mart stopped selling a particular CD because Target sold it too, I’m not an expert, but that doesn’t make much sense.</p>
