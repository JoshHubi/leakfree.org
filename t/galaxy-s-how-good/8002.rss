    <title>Galaxy S - How good?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/galaxy-s-how-good/8002</link>
    <description>It&#39;s ALMOST certain that I will get a Galaxy S.

IM GETTING IT TOMORROW, so I&#39;m quite desperate. 

Is it good? Or is there other things that are better and in the same price range?</description>

            <p><em>bows</em> No problem. I’m an Android enthusiast. Although, to the assured bafflement of many of you I’m also a Mac enthusiast. I have a Macbook Pro and it kicks ass. But I keep Windows 7 installed on a partition in case I ever need to, you know, play Black Mesa. So I like Mac OS more than I like Windows, but I hate iOS, and love me some Android</p>
<p>(plus, Android development is easiest on a Mac. You don’t need to install USB drivers, or any bullshit like that)</p>

            <p>But no, I’m not buying androids because it’s different than iphone or anything, hell, I can jailbreak the damn thing, get free apps, and shit, but I chose my android because I want to learn about it, make stuff for it (eventually, Thanks nickavv) and it has much much more potential than an iphone.</p>
<p>I’m glad you provided some good reasons to purchase an android phone. I respect that.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m calling it stupid right off the bat because people tend to pull the glass card all the time. It’s irrelevant because if you are careful with your phone you will never have that problem. I am not “implying” anything. Don’t drop your phone, and you won’t have issues. Simple as that. Yes Apple makes money off of people who break/drop their phones. Every company makes money off of people who break their phones. That’s business and that’s been business for a long time. But to say that you shouldn’t buy one of the best/highest rated products on the market because it will break IF you drop it is actually IMPLYING that people drop their phones. So you are actually accusing me of implying something that you are IMPLYING that everyone does. You’re IMPLYING that people drop their phones and that they shouldn’t buy the iPhone because…you’re IMPLYING that people drop their phones. See how that works? I’m not trying to be a dick here, but obviously you don’t understand what I said. You buy the best phone on the market…and you take care of it like it’s the best phone on the market. You love it, you never have problems, and it performs like the best phone on the market. PERIOD. And don’t call me a macfag. That’s insulting. I hate my mac (which I bought because I suckered into the whole “college” mac scene) and I think Windows 7 is by far the best operating system out there. There’s a laundry list of reasons why Windows is better than the Apple OS, just like there is a laundry list of reasons why the iOS is better than other phones.</p>

            <p>That is a downside of the open-sourceness. But it also isn’t usually too hard to get around and update on your own via rooting and ROMs, if you have the right kinda phone. Anyway, the time it takes carriers/manufacturers to update, and the number of devices they actually hit, is getting better:</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/6/a/6af471357057be7a05e937c8f5b87a9f4ee59454.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="fgakgEjXfO9ULKJKDRVsfy1cVOA" width="660" height="250"></p>
<p>See how the 2.3.3 line is growing faster than the older lines appear to be?</p>

<p>Too bad you still have to buy a new phone of you want the latest updates because the older ones don’t get them.</p>
<p>By the way, I love my Samsung Focus.</p>

<p>How much did you pay for your I2. Because it seems that people who buy android phones are just resisting being the “same” as everyone else by not buying the iPhone. The 4 is only $100 now and is still faster than a lot of dual-core phones out there. And the 4S, which I have, is like lightning. In benchmarks (if you’d like me to cite them I can, but a quick google search will back this up) it has been shown to beat several competing phones that were recently released. Even with it’s “slow” 800MHz processor and “low” ram of 512Mb, it’s still beating other phones, like the SII, with their “faster” 1.0 and 1.2GHz processors and 1 Gig of memory. Tech specs are totally irrelevant when it comes to real world performance and OS efficiency - and when it comes to efficiency Apple is king. Not to mention with such a low hardware fragmentation in the iPhone lineup, most applications will run smoother because the developer only has to make it run on a few systems nicely. Furthermore, developers tend to favor the iPhone and it generally gets more high-profile releases like games, and applications are tailor made for it. Applications load and run like butter on the iPhone. Just can’t understand why people refuse to believe these things and end up getting the inferior device just to go against the crowd.</p>

            <p>I’m sorry, then.  I took from your post that your family was not-very-well-off, which was clearly the incorrect opinion.  It’s a bit rage-inducing to me because one of the chief reasons that the US is in the shitter right now is because stupid fuckwits bought shit they couldn’t afford.</p>

<p>Well we’re not poor, we do have money our family saved up, and our family was quite prosperous. Since my parents are both dentists.</p>
<p>It’s just that we do not want to overkill on stuff.</p>

            <p>I recommend android smartphones as long as you get them the same way I do, from your local black friend for under 100$ per phone.</p>
<p>Unless you live in the U.S. where they get blacklisted.</p>
<p>Canada doesn’t blacklist phones because we’re not racist.</p>

            <p>As long as you’re very good at following directions you should be fine. I’ve rooted a whole lot of peoples’ phones (here at school people know who to call when they want an expert to do it), and 3 of my own, without any trouble. I usually live with the stock software for as long as I can stand to before I root though, because it is a lot of trouble to go through</p>

            <p>Reasons for: better battery life, no uninstallable Verizon apps (the Incredible 2 comes with 18!), ability to overclock, ability to make your phone a wifi hotspot for free, stock Android instead of HTC Sense (nicer, faster), you’ll be able to upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich as soon as developers for our phone cook it up (the main reason I did this)</p>
<p>Reasons against: If you screw it up you’re done for. Warranty voided, totally screwed. You also won’t be able to get support from HTC or Verizon for anything ever.</p>

            <p>So I’m starting to get what cyanogen mod is, and what it does, but I’m scared to try it. Does anybody know any really good reason to do it, and how hard it is to do it?</p>
