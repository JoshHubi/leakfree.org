    <title>Underwater Barnacles</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/underwater-barnacles/1138</link>
    <description>Yes I know the mods nearly done and all that... But I thought I&#39;d make a thread regarding this, I think it&#39;s too interesting to go in the small detail thread soo...

How about placing Barnacles in some of the more boring underwater portions of the game. For example throughout the underwater &#39;maze&#39; in [u][i]Residue Processing[/i][/u] or perhaps several in the Coolant/water in [i][u]Lamba Complex[/u][/i].

The Barnacle&#39;s could latch onto the bottom of the waterway and their tongues could simply float in the water and should you touch them, function basically like the normal ones, except of course they may cause you to drown as well as eat your face.... :&#39;(


Sorry if this has been suggested before the data crash. :meh:</description>

<p>For one so proud of his linguistic abilities, can you even read the thread and forum names? “Suggestion Box &gt; Underwater Barnacles”. The suggestion has been denied, and therefore the thread is redundant. I already pointed out that any of this can be discussed elsewhere quite freely. Quite frankly I couldn’t give a flying fuck what you want to see or don’t want to see. <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">I</span></span> want to see you STFU or GTFO, and if you keep pushing me I think you’ll find my banhammer vastly more eloquent than all your florid prose.</p>

            <p>This is a wonderful thread. I usually just lurk here but after reading that dissertation on Barnacle Biology and the rebuttal to it I just had to congratulate you gentlemen. Carry on.</p>
<p>But you have to admit, underwater barnacles <span class="bbcode-i">would</span> be cool. I would love to see them luring headcrabs with their tongues floating on the surface of the water and such, or perhaps learn to lure bigger prey by holding ammo/health/fallen comrades on the tip of the tongue. Obviously this has no place in BM (so it really doesn’t fit in this forum), but in Ep. 3 or HL3 it would be cool.</p>

<p>It’s one thing to be discussing the merits and pitfalls of barnacles underwater in Black Mesa. It’s a completely different thing to be arguing ceaselessly over such petty things as the definition of physiological evolution in another universe and the canon of Half-Life.</p>

            <p>You know instead of making that post you could have just kept your damned mouth shut and not been a total arse about trying to come up with flimsy reasons to keep talking about this.</p>
<p>It really should come down to this. Barnacles haven’t been underwater yet. If they should have been they would have been by now. Since they haven’t they are not going to be in BM. How fucking complicated is that?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While this suggestion is quite obviously denied, the FAQ mention (of not speaking about barnacles) is so people may stop asking how much of HL2’s resources we should expect to see. It’s cited in the form of an answer to that question.</p>
<p>We’re <span class="bbcode-b">allowed</span> to talk about barnacles. We’re <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> allowed to speak of… “HOW MANY NEW SKINS/HOW MUCH IMPORTED CONTENT FROM HL2 CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE[/SIZE]”.</p>
<p>Even then, all that is told is the barnacle will be borrowing HL2’s “<span class="bbcode-i">model, animations, AI and textures</span>”. This does not exclude some expansion to the AI to, say, work with their difficulty. This does not forbid new placements of the creature in levels.</p>
<p>While there’s consensus that we shouldn’t have these creatures underwater, and the suggestion should be denied, I don’t want to see another travesty of denial based upon unsound citations.</p>

<p>The assumption that barnacles breathe air because everything else on Xen does is a very fair assumption to make.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Or it would be, if not for Marc Laidlaw telling us that ‘nothing is native to Xen’, and about Xen’s nature as a border between many different worlds/dimensions (Earth and the Combine worlds, amongst two). There is no particular reason to suppose that barnacles share a planet or even dimension of origin with any other Xenian species.</p>
<p>But that is the only assumption of yours I would challenge. [COLOR=‘Red’]And yet it’s all irrelevant, as this isn’t going to happen. Barnacles are covered in the ‘Thou Shalt Not Discuss’ FAQ, and this discussion no longer belongs in the BM Suggestion Box. If you want to continue it, take it to the HL series forum. I can move posts if necessary.</p>

            <p>Goddamn, mattemuse, you really have no idea what you’re talking about.  That term “baseless assumption” that you used about a dozen times in your rebuttal doesn’t apply here because none of my assumptions are baseless.</p>
<p>If you think hydrogen can serve any useful purpose in respiration, then you clearly know nothing about organic chemistry.  And your claim that your speculation that they breathe hydrogen is “just as valid” as my claim that they breathe oxygen is the most laughable thing I’ve read in days.  I backed my claim up with a body of scientific evidence, whereas you backed yours up with, and I quote, "    ".</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>jellyfish, real barnacles, etc. do exactly what you are claiming is impossible underwater.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They also don’t attempt to snatch up inanimate objects.  They have a clear reaction to living prey that Xen barnacles lack.  If a Xen barnacle’s tongue were to flap around in a current and light on random objects, it would waste a gross amount of energy dragging them in only to find no reward for the effort.  Xen barnacles specialize in lying still and waiting for living prey to blunder into them.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>baseless assumption (xen barnacles breathing apparatus == real barnacle) and again, you are missing the point which was that if you see a real barnacle out of the water, you don’t assume it’s a different species than an real barnacle underwater .</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I only compared Xen barnacles to Earth barnacles because someone else did (Floyd, I believe), so I built on his argument and used it for my own purposes.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>baseless assumption (the effect of water on xen creatures cells == earth creatures cells)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Again, you demonstrate your complete lack of knowledge on the subject.  <span class="bbcode-i">No</span> biologically viable membrane is impervious to water, which means that the tendency of osmosis towards higher solute concentration is still in effect.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSION: writing a mind-numbingly arrogant wall of text doesn’t make your opinion a fact. This seems to be a recurring theme in this thread.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>…said the pot to the kettle.  At least I can actually back up my opinion, whereas you cling to your baseless speculations and attack holes in my argument that only appear to be there because of your lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>geekofalltrades’ argument is flawed in two simple ways (as far as I bothered to read that is)</p>
<p>The assumption that barnacles breathe air because everything else on Xen breathes air is like saying everything on land breathes gas, so it’s safe to assume everything under water does too.</p>
<p>Then there’s the assumption that Xen barnacles are related to Earth barnacles, or at least that there are any similarities besides name and appearance. Barnacles are called barnacles because that is what they resemble most that people already know. Houndeyes sound like dogs and have lots of eyes, bullquids look like squids, gman looks like a gman, but that doesn’t mean they actually are, or are related to any of those things. For all we know it could have more in common with a lungfish then a real barnacle.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The assumption that barnacles breathe air because everything else on Xen does is a very fair assumption to make.  After all, all multicellular Earth-dwelling organisms breathe air.  What I assumed here is that life on Xen is descended from a single common ancestor, as it is on Earth, which is also a fair assumption when Darwinian models are applied to the situation (which have proven a very valuable and reliable resource in the field of biology).</p>
<p>And again, I only compared Xen barnacles to Earth barnacles to build on someone else’s argument and illustrate a point.  I never suggested that they are in any way similar (in fact, I said that it would be <span class="bbcode-i">impossible</span> for them to function in a similar manner).</p>
<p>DOUBLE EDIT: And now that I think about it, I have another point that lends credibility to all of my arguments: Xen barnacles were able to survive on Earth for ~20 years (the time between HL1 and HL2).  During this time, they probably fed mostly on Earth organisms (especially in the areas in which they’re seen in Half-Life 2).  This suggests that they can derive sustenance from Earth organisms, which in turn suggests that, like Earth-organisms, <span class="bbcode-i">they are carbon-based</span>.  (This would be a reasonable assumption to make anyway; the only other platform viable for life is silicon, and even then, carbon is a much better candidate for a number of reasons.)  This newest theory has a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> of implications for the argument at hand.</p>

            <p>I just feel like jumping on this thread to state the obvious:</p>
<p>Underwater barnacles would be cool.</p>
<p>Underwater barnacles in episode 3 could be really cool.</p>
<p>Underwater barnacles in Black Mesa would be cool, but wrong.</p>
<p>People who feel the need to go into detail trying to refute these facts are not cool, but still wrong.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">even if there is “feng-shui energy” on Xen that might sustain its native organisms, there is no such energy on Earth</span></p>
<p>Baseless assumption, and you are missing the point (which is that barnacle biology is an unknown quantity, even to professional, award-winning biologists like yourself).<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><br>
Xen organisms and Earth organisms both breathe oxygen</span></p>
<p>baseless assumption. my speculation that xen organisms breath hydrogen is<br>
just as valid as your speculation that they breath oxygen.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><br>
Liberating oxygen from a liquid atmosphere requires a completely different physiological structure than liberating oxygen from a gaseous atmosphere<br>
</span></p>
<p>some animals have “physiological structures” that can do both. i.e. frogs can absorb oxygen through their skin whether they are underwater or on land.  And again, your argument rests on an assumption which is just speculation on your part - that barnacle breathing apparatus is analogous to any earth creatures breathing apparatus.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><br>
the Xen barnacle would require thousands of times as much oxygen to sustain itself for a similar period of time. Its “shell” would have to be enormous.</span></p>
<p>baseless assumption (xen barnacles breathing apparatus == real barnacle) and again, you are missing the point which was that if you see a real barnacle out of the water, you don’t assume it’s a different species than an real barnacle underwater .<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><br>
The barnacle specializes in lying in wait for prey: ambient underwater currents would deprive it of this technique.</span></p>
<p>jellyfish, real barnacles, etc. do exactly what you are claiming is impossible underwater.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">osmotic pressure which eventually causes cells to burst, and is a huge problem for any aquatic organism.</span></p>
<p>baseless assumption (the effect of water on xen creatures cells == earth creatures cells)</p>
<p>CONCLUSION: writing a mind-numbingly arrogant wall of text doesn’t make your opinion a fact. This seems to be a recurring theme in this thread.</p>
