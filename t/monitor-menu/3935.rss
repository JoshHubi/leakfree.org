    <title>Monitor Menu</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/monitor-menu/3935</link>
    <description>So, i got a CTL 7Gx monitor for 2 bucks and i thought i could hook it up as a new second monitor. Now, its not so bad if its broken forever because it didn&#39;t really cost me any money.

i hooked it up, and it worked for a day, but the next day, after a few minutes the monitor options panel popped into the middle of the screen (not a window, the settings that are hard-coded into the monitor). and when i pressed any of the front buttons, including the power button, the selector just spins around all the options and wont stop.

front power button wont work, it just stops the selector until you stop pressing it, then it keeps going (side rocker power switch still works). none of the buttons to actually select the options will respond on the menu.

if you pull out the monitor cable and put it in again, but not as hard (feel free to quote this out of context) then it will fix it for a while.

so, is it broke? or is there something i can do to fix it?

ill answer any questions about what i typed up there.</description>

            <p>^that. I have fixed a monitor with a broken input switch before. The reason the power button doesn’t shut it down and just pauses the selector is because most of the buttons on monitors are encoded in a matrix.  A quick fix would to be just cut one of the legs on the broken switch off, or find a new replacement button.</p>
