<p>The ironic thing is that, after all my asinine joking about PhotoBloat 11 and Steamypoo etc., my Acer Aspire One netbook actually runs Photoshop fine (admittedly version 7, which was the last decent one they did before they bloated it all up with that CS BS). It also runs Dreamweaver very well, and I do actually have Steam installed, but only to play World Of Goo. But, obviously, I mostly use it for pr0n.</p>
<p>This is the 11 inch AO751h model by the way. A great little machine with a very nice 1366x768 screen.</p>

            <p>Tried it out and, well, it’s an OS that opens the browser automatically. They provide exactly what they say they will though. A netbook OS that is web-based, and boots up hella fast.</p>

<p>Read up on it before you criticize it. Google is making all their web-apps work offline as well, that way you can use it while working in an area where you can’t connect. Sure, it’s based off the google docs, which isn’t the most powerful office suite ever, but hell, not bad for being web based.</p>

<p>Agreed. I love Google Chrome. As simplified as it is, I still feel that I can control what I want with the browser. The address bar combined with a search engine is just extremely convenient, and it’s so fast it blows all the other browsers out of the water.</p>
<p>If Google were to come out with an OS that combines the speed, sleekness, and easy yet usable interface they have for Google Chrome, while still supporting the power and efficiency of a gaming computer, I would probably be all over it.</p>

            <p>It just seems counterproductive on Google’s part that they try get into a niche (Netbooks) rather than attempt take over a larger chunk of the market, offering more features to the costumers and ensuring a larger install base. I mean, they <span class="bbcode-i">are</span> bent on world domination after all. <span class="bbcode-i">IT JUST SEEMS FISHY TO ME, NOT BUYING IT!</span> :rabies:</p>

            <p>For people who need these simplistic OS’s and are really only out to get the internet, it actually sounds like a brilliant idea. However, for those of us who use our computers for gaming and other more complicated tasks, it’s pretty much worthless.</p>
<p>I like how they advertise it though. “You know all that stuff that pretty much makes your computer a computer? Well, who needs it.” It’s funny, but at the same time anyone who has any idea what that stuff does and doesn’t listen closely to the advertisement is going to just be like “WTF?”.</p>

<p>Well said.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are going to miss the point of this OS… “But it’s just a web browser? How am I going to run PhotoBloat 11 or play my Steamypoo games?”</p>
<p>The idea is that it’s a fast-booting lightweight OS that is completely internet based, and is designed to be used on inexpensive lightweight machines by people who spend most of their techno-time on the web.</p>
<p>I can see it kickstarting the development of really cheap really lightweight netbooks with a very high battery life that will make current laptops and netbooks look like an Amstrad PPC512 luggable from 1988.</p>
<p>I think the idea is that some small apps and plugins will be stored on the netbook in small solid state drives, and all files you create using web apps are stored on the web, so they are accessible from anywhere. The thing is, it is really aimed at people who use social networking sites, online communities and just browse the web, rather than create content.</p>
<p>I think it’s a great idea, the only caveat being…“Doh, where’s my wifi gone? How can I save my files or update to Facebook now?”</p>
<p>Well, I’m sure Google will think of that and implement some sort of local usage ability for their online apps like they do with Google Gears, which will automatically upload files once wifi connection has been restored.</p>
<p>A move away from the bloatware of Windows and the ridiculous neverending upgrades of power hungry hardware is a real step in the right direction for the web-loving masses. I for one will probably wipe Windows XP off my netbook as soon as Chrome OS is released, but I’ll not be installing it on my power hungry monster gaming rig. Well, not until after Black Mesa is released and I’ve played it to death, whenever that will be  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I <span class="bbcode-i">can’t</span> help but scream <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">THIS IS THE FUTUUURE AAAAH</span></span>[/SIZE]. So yeah, see you guys in two years when I’ll be browsing through my Internet-based OS with my Natal, playing games on my OnLive. Laughable as it is, cloud computing is indeed the <span class="bbcode-i">fuuuuutuuuuuuuure</span>, at least a future wanted by corporations like Google, if we are willing to buy it depends on us, the consumers. I myself am using Chrome right now because, as it’s pimped in the videos, it’s fast. But would I fancy a whole OS which, while fast, I have no control over? It sure does sound sweet and I can certainly see myself enjoying it, but if it comes at the price of inferiority and dependence, something I’d rather not like to give in exchange for that almost debatable comfort (I mean, if you’re a <span class="bbcode-i">slug</span> you’ll feel comfortable sliding in your own filth while others prod you, ahem), well, no thanks.</p>
<p>Chrome OS sounds alright, but if everyone pushes lifestyle in that way we’ll be all like <a href="https://therawfeed.com/pix/wall-e-fat-people-in-chairs.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> in a couple of decades.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  (I don’t worry though, I know we’ll nuke everything whenever WW3 occurs anyway :retard <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>There’s one big flaw with ChromeOS: what if you don’t have access to the internet at any given time? No more laptop.</p>

            <p>I sense a shitload of elitists in here. Some people don’t play games on a computer, program softwares or do modeling. Some people just go on the internet, read their e-mails and watch videos on YouTube.</p>

            <p>I like the tabbed OS concept.  The panels and overlays seemed nice as well.</p>

            <p>So this is an OS that you don’t install <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> on? Only the browser? I hardly call that convenient.</p>
<p>Might suit some people though, just not ones I know.</p>
