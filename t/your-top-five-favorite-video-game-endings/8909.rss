    <description>We haven&#39;t had a Top Five list thread in awhile, so I figured it was time for another.

            <p>Fallout 1<br>
Sent out on a suicide mission to save your vault from dehydration then sent out again to destroy a mutant army (seriously?) only to be banished for “threatening” the life of the people of the vault and how it connects to Fallout 2’s story line</p>
<p>That was pure awesome</p>
<p>EDIT: If you haven’t, try reading the <a href="https://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault_Dweller's_memoirs" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Vault Dweller’s memoir</a>, it’s an excellent writing of the canon story of Fallout 1 and the background of Fallout 2</p>

<p>Saints Row The Third</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with this being on your list.  I don’t like some of the fallout from the canon ending, but it does have huge potential for awesome.</p>
<p>It’s tough choosing my top 5.  Instead I’m going to throw out a bunch that I really enjoyed, and not put them in order, and may or may not go over 5.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy<br>
Saints Row: The Third<br>
Saints Row 2<br>
Half-Life 2: Episode 2<br>
Metal Gear Solid 4 (not the whole 90 minute ending, but the thing at the very end)<br>
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (the last battle had a truly epic feel)</p>
<p>And that’s all I can think of for now.  I probably missed some that I like more than what I listed here, but whatever.</p>

            <p>in no particular order</p>
<p>Portal 2 - aww glados turned good… crap no she’s not… oh nvm she’s letting me go… glados you would… what?.. singing?.. o.O… O.O … extreme happiness… oh shit… COMPANION CUBE!!!   basically how it went</p>
<p>Dead Space 2 - just the whole final chapter i thought was realllllly well done</p>
<p>The Witcher 1 - this one had my jaw drop and that “holy… wow” moment of realization</p>
<p>The Witcher 2  - the guys at CDPR are ridiculous at crafting good stories, this one ended with 16 solid, interesting endings that captured the results of your decisions throughout the game extremely well in a way no game can compare</p>
<p>Mass Effect 2 - (up until giant reaper human baby, that i thought was pretty lame)  the final mission itself though i thought was the best of the entire trilogy and i don’t know why they didn’t do more in that kind of style.</p>

            <p>Psychonauts<br>
Portal 2<br>
Serious Sam 3 (you fight a big thing and it goes explodey and then you win, hurray)<br>
Doom 2 (you kill John Romero and he goes boom and then you win, hurray)<br>
Saints Row The Third</p>
<p>I have a love for games that place gameplay over story, and when the game is fun to play and when the ending is just as irrelevant as the story beyond “here is a big bad dude and he is in your way, murder him to advance,” I thoroughly enjoy it.</p>

<p>CoD Black Ops: Hate on this game all you want. The campaign is fucking decent.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sorry man, but that campaign would go on my top 5 bad endings. The whole story was so movie cliche and it was obvious that Reznov wasn’t real it became obvious after the one meeting in the caves and your partner says “What are you doing Mason, come on”. The ending was also pretty predictable to me because the whole time you never really stopped anything, it was all flashbacks and on top of that you never stopped Nikita Dragovich’s plans on the missions you got to play.</p>

            <p>Well. The best video game beginning ever that I can remember is Metroid Prime. Ending? Half-Life 2 was pretty good. Star Wars Republic Commando was okay. Unreal and Unreal Tournament’s entirety are vast and amazing. Halo 1’s was pretty different. You had to cover a lot of ground and it was like the Metroid escape timer in a way but you had to run a very long distance. Call of Duty 1’s was different, and climactic/anti-climactic simultaneously. Painkiller’s cinematics were cool.</p>

            <p>Portal 2: Pretty obvious. Epic, emotional and hilarious at the same time. The fact that valve manages to get this out of a bunch of robots and a mute protagonist astounds me.</p>
<p>CoD Black Ops: Hate on this game all you want. The campaign is fucking decent.</p>
<p>Fallout NV: Obviously doesn’t have a single ending, but I loved the way that all your actions throughout the game lead up to the future of the Mojave.</p>
<p>HL2EP3: Simply the greatest ending to any game ever. I laughed. I cried. I bashed my head against my computer screen and commissioned a gigantic gold statue of Gabe Newell.</p>

            <p>Here’s a few old games that I liked the endings to. In no order.</p>
<p>Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2 (the dark end was cool, the good end a bit silly)</p>
<p>Jedi Outcast</p>
<p>Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny (Good storywise but a noticable loss of quality as you go through the game - I guess it was rushed at the end)</p>
<p>Clive Barker’s Undying (The final boss was disappointing but outside of that)</p>
<p>Diablo  (and Diablo 2)</p>

<p>Never played it but I heard the ending is shit… and I guess Im just attracted to shit</p>
<p>In all seriousness. I can’t say that, if i enjoyed a game, I’m happy that its over even if it is so beautifully written that you can’t keep your eyes from pissing themselves</p>

            <p>No order:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Battlefield 3</span></span>: People might complain about it being a tube, but I loved it on Hardcore mode. The whole game felt like a 5 Star movie and it was beautiful and well executed. The final chase was great if you stayed alive through the whole level it gives a rush.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIz2oU2XSk4" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIz2oU2XSk4</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Superbrothers Sword &amp; Sworcery EP</span></span>: This game took me by surprise, I was expecting it to be fun and addicting, and I liked the art style and it had great music, But I never asked for all these feels. It almost made me draw a tear.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsJv6z0jxeY" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsJv6z0jxeY</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Halo(all of them)</span></span>: I only want to put one of each series into my list, so I’d say Halo 3. Sgt. Johnson’s death made me sad on the inside, he was a damn good soldier and a friend :’(   (Reach almost made it, if it weren’t for the fact that we all knew they were going to die.)  The warthog escape and music was great.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VybS1C-4CAk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VybS1C-4CAk</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Final Fantasy VII</span></span>: What can I say…<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4_sw0trdNc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4_sw0trdNc</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Kingdom Hearts II</span></span>: This game has aged well, the graphics are still high quality and so is the gameplay, I loved the fasted pace ending, it felt like an episode of Bleach or DBZ.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTsrMPrYhFc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTsrMPrYhFc</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Runner Ups</span>:<br>
Halo Reach<br>
Devil May Cry 4<br>
Xenogears(I couldn’t fit it in because I haven’t beaten it yet (my bro deleted my save, long story)<br>
there are some more, but I can’t remember…</p>

System Shock 2 -the whole game is a master piece<br>

Quake 4 -build up to finale was cool<br>
Never Winter Nights (and expansions)<br>
Tomb Raider - Underworld - dont know why, felt quite epic and fun gameplay</p>

<li>Half Life 2 Episode 2 - I’ve never seen so much emotion in a game before, I cried actually.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think there was ever any game that made me yearn so much for a sequel. It’s Valve’s own fault for ending Episode 2 like that, and yet they wonder so many people are anticipating their next game so much.</p>
