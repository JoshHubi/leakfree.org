    <title>Looking for updated list of console vars/commands</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-for-updated-list-of-console-vars-commands/15196</link>
    <description>Before the &quot;early purchase&quot; I had quite few modifications as discussed in this thread: [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/13545-post-your-TWEAKS/&#39;]post your TWEAKS[/url]

However very few of these are working now. For example the &quot;sk_plr_dmg_9mm &quot;8&quot;&quot; doesn&#39;t work. 

Can I get an updated list of these vars/commands?   :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Thank you, I’ll try the custom folder method.<br>
What I’ve tried so far is extracting the vpk directly to the Black Mesa/bms folder, exactly where it should be, and I’ve modified the Black Mesa/bms/scripts/gameplay/weapons/weapon_glock.dmx by adding 50 to every single damage value (it’s just for a test so that I’ll definitely see the change). This method didn’t work.<br>
I’ve also tried deleting the bms_misc_000.vpk and bms_misc_dir.vpk so that it could read the values from the folders instead (but I’ve experienced the same thing, that it doesn’t read anything from there, as the game got really glitchy)<br>
I’ve also tried repackaging the contents of bms_misc_000.vpk and placing them in the addons folder, that didn’t work either.<br>
I’ll report back if the custom folder technique worked. (I thought this custom folder only worked with Insurgency)</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Nope custom folder method doesn’t seem to work.<br>
Just to be clear what I did, was create a folder named “custom” in Black Mesa/bms, I’ve tried creating another folder called “mods” within the custom folder, added my modified scripts folder there with the modded .dmx files. No effect.<br>
I’ve also tried adding a packaged scripts folder and place it in the custom folder. No effect on that either.</p>

Can you tell me how you managed to mod the glock?</p>
<p>EDIT2:<br>
Excuse my ignorance, once I modded the gameinfo.txt everything works. Now I have a glock with the power of a tactical nuke. <em>evil laughing intensifies</em><br>
Thanks for the help.</p>

            <p>I just tested it by upping the glock damage. Now I can kill headcrabs with a single shot. So clearly, it works.</p>

            <p>In case you’re unaware, the Steam version has an auto crouch jump system, togglable in the options (or via [tt]cl_auto_crouch_jump[/tt]). When enabled (default), most jumps are just normal jumps, and you very rarely need to do crouch jumping.</p>
<p>Regarding damage variables (sk_plr_dmg_…):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The damage variables are now kept in the weapon file .dmxs, which are in scripts/gameplay/weapons, which you have to extract from the game’s VPKs. This is a more efficient way of storing the information, and prevents tampering for MP. But you can edit them freely as they are just text files.</p>

            <p>Much thanks!<br>
However, I can’t find many of the old cvars I used to use. Specifically, I can’t find the cvars for jump height and the 9mm . Can you land me a hand with that? Is it now hard-coded into the exe?</p>

            <p>You can get the list from within the game itself by using the console command [tt]cvarlist[/tt].</p>
<p>In order to save the cvar list to a file, start or load a game, then open the console and type the following:</p>
<p><code>con_logfile cvarlist.txt
cvarlist
con_logfile console.log</code>The last [tt]con_logfile[/tt] command is just to close and flush the cvarlist.txt file by starting a new log file before any other messages are output to the console. The log files will be located in the bms\ folder.</p>
