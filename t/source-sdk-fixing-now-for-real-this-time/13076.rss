    <title>Source SDK Fixing (Now for real this time!)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-sdk-fixing-now-for-real-this-time/13076</link>
    <description>My desktop Source SDK is working great with SteamPipe, but my laptop has issues with the new system. Episode Two content refuses to load in my levels, generating giant &quot;ERROR&quot; models rather than the intended props. The loading log indicates stock HL2 content is being loaded. The SDK loader is obviously defunct and doesn&#39;t work well. The intended Hammer executable in Half-Life 2 doesn&#39;t load the menu to pick the game like my desktop&#39;s Hammer does, for whatever reason.

Is there a way to edit Hammer&#39;s configs without the GUI? I really want to get my SDK working on my laptop again, so I can optimize my mod more effectively with a lower spec system.</description>

            <p>The error in the startup is gone! Thanks for that, I’ll have to post a message thanking TopHatt for that too (He used to frequent another forum I’m on).</p>
<p>EDIT: Nope. Crossbow still shows up as an error, my custom static prop shadows compiling mode is gone, and for some reason the compiler spits back “Access is Denied” for every. single. compile. tool.</p>

            <p>Yeah uh, if you moved your Steam directory, you should probably re-download stuff just in case the configs got screwed over. That sounds like the root of the problem.</p>

            <p>I’ll have to look into that, sounds nice.</p>
<p>Also, on startup of the editor, the following message leads in the messages bar:</p>
<p>Invalid game “c:\programfiles (x86)\steam\steamapps\accountname\half-life 2\hl2” found in VPROJECT environment variable, ignoring."</p>
<p>Rather odd, considering my whole editor has been running from drive I:\ this whole time. It probably has to do with how I uprooted the install to an external hard drive for transfer to this computer.</p>

            <p>And it still doesn’t work?</p>
<p>By the way, I recommend using VBCT to compile rather than Hammer. That way you don’t need to deal with lost compile parameters, among other benefits.</p>

            <p>It could be that the update failed to execute properly, or failed to clean some stuff up or something, which means the integrity would be wrong.</p>
<p>And yes, everything is in the Half-Life 2 folder now. But that hasn’t given me any problems.</p>

            <p>While I’m not 100% sure, I do think Valve tried to roll everything into one Half-Life 2 folder like Deathmonkey said.</p>
<p>If the issue is with the missing content, I’m 98% sure that the FGD has nothing to do with that, just entities. I’m actually not sure why the SDK has issues finding episodic content. I have to extract the content ato a folder nd manually mount them in the gameinfo.txt that the SDK uses.</p>

<p>I’m guessing my config isn’t set up right. Where are the Ep1 and 2 FGDs? Did they get rolled into the main hl2 FGD?</p>

            <p>Double post to bump and elaborate.<br>
Running the SDK launcher causes many more errors than the Hammer standalone executable due to the new framework. However, on loading from the standalone hammer executable with the Ep2 configuration, the Messages window displays the following error:</p>
<p>Invalid game “C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\appmanifest_420.acf” found in VPROJECT environment variable, ignoring.</p>
<p>In the level, the only thing seeming to be missing is the weapon_crossbow model, with has an ERROR model taking its place.</p>

            <p>No, Hammer flat out won’t load under the Episode Two configuration. I’ll have to get a screencap of the error soon.</p>

            <p>Just to be sure, are you asking how to switch configs without that startup box?<br>
In Hammer, go to Tools&gt;Options, then change the one in that dialogue box and hit okay. When you reset Hammer it should be that new config.</p>

            <p>My desktop Source SDK is working great with SteamPipe, but my laptop has issues with the new system. Episode Two content refuses to load in my levels, generating giant “ERROR” models rather than the intended props. The loading log indicates stock HL2 content is being loaded. The SDK loader is obviously defunct and doesn’t work well. The intended Hammer executable in Half-Life 2 doesn’t load the menu to pick the game like my desktop’s Hammer does, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Is there a way to edit Hammer’s configs without the GUI? I really want to get my SDK working on my laptop again, so I can optimize my mod more effectively with a lower spec system.</p>
