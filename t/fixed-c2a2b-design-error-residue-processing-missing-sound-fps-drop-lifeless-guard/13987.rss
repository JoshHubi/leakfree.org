    <title>[FIXED] C2A2B Design Error + Residue Processing: Missing Sound FPS Drop &amp; Lifeless Guard</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixed-c2a2b-design-error-residue-processing-missing-sound-fps-drop-lifeless-guard/13987</link>
    <description>In Residue Processing I ran into two issues:

#1 If you save the guard from the headcrabs and barnacles early in the level, he will be stuck in an idle pose and won&#39;t respond to interaction. He should be able to assist you if you save him. After saving the guard he ran into the doorway and wouldn&#39;t move. Talking to him and running into him wouldn&#39;t move him. I needed to progress through the door so I was forced to kill him.

#2 I replayed a particular sequence on the conveyor belt multiple times (by reloading a save) and my fps dropped from 280 to 40 (and below) for a brief period every time. The fps drop happened in the exact same spot each time for a few seconds. It seems like it was related to a missing sound file.

C2A2B:

#3 I encountered an issue on an earlier map (C2A2B) where a grunt was stuck in a wall which caused a level design error. I forgot the &quot;getpos&quot; command at that point but it was around the time when a security guard told Freeman that it sounded like there was an ambush ahead and I think he mentioned something about a dance card.
