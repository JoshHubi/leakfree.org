    <title>Text on the labboards</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/text-on-the-labboards/12906</link>
    <description>Hello, guys! I am from Ukraine and we love this great game so much! We are doing translation to our language but it is some troubles. We translated many of audio voices, text and textures. But some text on textures of boards in the labs is still incomprehensible. So I decided to ask you for help, because it is your native language. Please write the exact text that is written here on textures. This text is written by hand and me it very difficult to recognize:&#39;( Sorry for my bad english, i speak russian.

There is the link with that textures: [url]https://yadi.sk/d/re2ZmLdGFZhgH[/url]

Some text that I was trying to recognize (is it right recognized?):

&quot;Paul - can you call Dr J. O. Marcel on ext 1187.463 about the Niobium 5 - He needs it for that AI Project &#39;thing&#39; - thanks
- Dr Montero&quot;

Sample Specimen &#39;EP - 0021&#39;
------------------&gt;
Purity - NMR spectragraphs display a
31.965% exotic content, 6.313%
unknown contamination (SR 3.96:A13)
and 61.722% (?normal?) chemical
composition.


Sample exhibits variable (?EMR?) polarisation
suggesting specimen is a di-electric
medium with internal charged particle
systems. Chereneou? phenomena? has bar?
exhibited in both samples from er-00
range and er-01 range &#39;greens&#39;

New specimen has
been (?requisitioned?)
IO:- GG-3883
Non standard analysis
Requested. Thanks
-Dr Truman

=======================================================

Partial conformity
with constancy (?of?)
interfacial angles.
Exotic matter with
odd physical properties
possible reasons for
abnormal growth structure.

Exhibits both
trigonal and
monoclinic 
axis orientation.

Theorised resonance frequences and associated matter refraction 
of polarized di-electric medium EP-0021

1.Observed &quot;2p&quot; energy spikes form within plasmatic shards
converting negative mass exotic matter into displaced
plasmatic particle streamers. This seems to occur more
in lower purity samples (621% Em).
Unknown how physical structure affects this..&quot;

2. String based theory non-viable are to potential time dilation (?effects?).
(??????), highly (?ame?) forms of specimen (?C?????) form strings (?r????)
than ????? refractions (?ove?) to (?higher?) resonance levels

[i]The words &quot;(?xxx?)&quot; (????? etc) i cant recognize.[/i]

I really hope for your help!</description>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">am3:</span><br>
“Theorized resonance <span class="bbcode-i">frequencies</span>”</p>

<p>All correct</p>

<p>“String based theory non-viable due to potential time dilation effects.<br>
However, highly pure forms of specimen could form strings other<br>
than helix refractions due to higher resonance levels.”</p>

<p>Hope that helps!  Good luck with your translation project!</p>
