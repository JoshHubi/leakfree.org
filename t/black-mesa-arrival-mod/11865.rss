    <title>Black Mesa Arrival Mod !?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-arrival-mod/11865</link>
    <description>[i]I don&#39;t know whether this is the right section for
but I would like to ask the community, if it is possible, 
to expand the first scene in BMS into a true &quot;arrival in Black Mesa facility&quot; scene ?
It is a shame that you can&#39;t explore the first scene and the level design failed his task![/i]

I speak about this scenes:

[i]Enter the train by yourselve...
I think it would be better, more atmospheric, if given the opportunity!
I don&#39;t want a outdoor scene like Blue Shift or Opposing Force...
only a &quot;i wait in lobby on my train&quot; scene[/i]

Anyone has seen this picture on the World Wide Web?

[b]1st:[/b] Black Screen with BMS Title Font appears

[b]2nd:[/b] You stand in the lobby and train arrives in 2-3 min
[i](You have time to explore)[/i]

[b]3rd:[/b] You enter the train
[i](Only when you enter the train, the real game begins)[/i]
the door close and the train start his tour to Sector C Anomalous Materials
