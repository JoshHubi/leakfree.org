            <p>Yeah I noticed that too.<br>
Well I’m not sure they stopped after being hit with a pistol, but they definitely stopped after being hurt with the crowbar. I prefered it too. More logical when you think about it (getting a crowbar in their face should disorientate them), and easier to deal with when there’s a lot of houndeyes to kill.</p>
