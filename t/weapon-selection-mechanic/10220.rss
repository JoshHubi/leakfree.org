    <description>Hey everyone

Amazing work on the mod, I can&#39;t say enough good things about it. It&#39;s almost like playing HL1 again for the first time. The one _minor_ thing that&#39;s bothering me though is that when you cycle through the weapon group of your current weapon, it doesn&#39;t start from the top, instead it starts from the weapon after your current one. This means that the shotgun isn&#39;t always &quot;double tap 3&quot;, because it&#39;s only &quot;press 3 once&quot; if you have the SMG equipped. I can understand the change but I think it makes more sense to have the consistency of how you select a given weapon.

A toggle for that would be super nice, so just putting it out there. Maybe someone else agrees. Now I&#39;ll go back to playing  :smiley:</description>

            <p>I agree. This really threw me off the first time I started using it, and for my entire playthrough, I could never get used to it. I always kept selecting the wrong weapon when in a hurry. The trouble with this system is it requires me to constantly be aware of what weapon I’m holding and calculate based off that where I want to go. It’s an extra mental task I have to perform, all the while having to think at the speed of light to beat the Marines’ godlike reflexes, and for what?</p>
<p>The central question behind a system like this is… What does it accomplish? How does it help? The number of key presses we have to do really isn’t a problem since no category ever gets more than four options, and all this seems to do is reduce the number of key presses we need by one or two… Sometimes. Personally, I’d vote for consistency over expediency every time, because consistency is faster in the long run. A key press or two save me nanoseconds. Having to think about it logically wastes whole seconds. Having to think about it, getting it wrong, dropping what I’m doing and staring at my weapon select usually wastes my life as I get my ass shot off my pelvis while I’m fiddling with the interface.</p>

            <p>bind “1” “use weapon_glock”<br>
bind “2” “use weapon_357”</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>it’s not the HL weapon selection system, but at least it is consistent</p>

<p>I agree… This change was really unnecessary and stupid. I always switched to wrong weapons using the number-keys.</p>
