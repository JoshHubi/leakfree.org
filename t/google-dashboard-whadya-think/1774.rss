            <p>Google doesn’t know much about me, they have my old email that’s not even valid anymore, and they are wrong about my age by about 7 years.</p>

            <p>maybe, but it’s important to remember that they are a company and their first responsibility is producing a profit for their shareholders. They have shown with china that they are not above putting that ahead of the rights of their users.</p>

            <p>Yes, because they care SO much that you googled porn at 6 am last Tuesday or that you’re doing a science project and only used wikipedia as your sources.</p>
<p>No, they use that information for providing a better product, and so I have no problem giving them some info as long as they put it to good use.</p>

            <p>I dont dislike em really and i use search, gmail and google docs constantly. I just find it a little troubling howmuch info they are able to find about people and how much control they would have on the information available to people if they wanted to effect that for their own ends.</p>

<p>They supply awesome products and services, and in return I put up with unobtrusive adverts that I normally don’t even notice let alone am bothered by. You’re just angry because everyone else likes them and you don’t.</p>
