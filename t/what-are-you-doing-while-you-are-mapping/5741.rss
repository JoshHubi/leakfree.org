    <description>What are you doing to make mapping much more interesting to you
and what are the results?

While I&#39;m creating maps for my Mod, I all the time have to listen to
Rammstein (German Hardrock)
And this is the Result:

            <p>Back in the good’ ole days, when I was attempting my first maps as part of a collaborative project in Blender, I listened to Kansas.  For some reason it made great working music.  Then, when I cranked out Overture two summers ago, I listened to my Led Zeppelin box set over and over and over and over…</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>Like duck, I join chatrooms, then ignore them.  Usually it’s the BM Steam chat.  When I hit a dead end, or am waiting for maps to compile, or have just burned myself out and need a breather, I pop into the chat for a while.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t really map anymore, which is a shame, because the second chunk of Overture is about 90% done; lately, I’ve been feeling bad about having it sitting on my hard drive, gathering dust.</p>

<p>When I started with this map, it was not planned that it looks a little like a swastika  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I had no real concept, everything was created in my brain, so this<br>
“half swastika” was not what I wanted to create, but the most important thing is, that is doesn’t looks like a “full swastika”…<br>
I’m NOT a nazi and Rammstein is just hardrock, it has nothing to do with Hitler,<br>
nazis, skinheads or something like that <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I think I also should try to listen to epic music, just for the “epic atmosphere”<br>
Thanks for the good tip Narfin  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>For me, it depends on what stage of mapping I am in. If I am working on the mundane foundation geometry, I loop the same song over and over to generate a sort of repetitive atmosphere. If I’m working on detail, I just let Winamp play whatever it wants from my folders. When I’m polishing the map (like atmosphere and lighting), I play songs with epic scores or unique rhythms (such as Trans-Siberian Orchestra).</p>
<p>Setting the mood with music really helps me stay motivated on mapping. Otherwise, I lose interest with only basic geometry, and end up with a map like killbox.<br>
Ironically though, some of my favorite levels <span class="bbcode-b">were</span> a lot like killbox.</p>
<p>One time while looping Yakety Sax I made this awesome box map with props everywhere and only a gravity gun as your weapon. It was only fitting that I made the song loop endlessly in the level too  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
