    <title>Weird &#39;gravity&#39; glitch.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weird-gravity-glitch/10408</link>
    <description>After I shot down the osprey, right before you have to fight the tank with the manual reload rocket launcher. All objects acted weird and floaty. 

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the osprey or something else triggered it, but it caused everything to clip (couldn&#39;t hit tank with rockets).

After a restart it was gone and I haven&#39;t been able to reproduce it.

I frapsed it.

+ a little thing. The glock isn&#39;t fully textured because you don&#39;t see some parts when holding/shooting/reloading the gun. 
But what happen when the idle animation kicks in.

+ I got vertical stripes on some guns on some occasions. These go away when the lighting changes. (see screen shot above)</description>
