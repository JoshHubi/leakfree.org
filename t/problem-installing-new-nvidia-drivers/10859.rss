    <title>Problem installing new Nvidia drivers</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-installing-new-nvidia-drivers/10859</link>
    <description>So I was trying to install the latest drivers because it apparently helps with playing JSR. I uninstalled my previous drivers, which I had been doing any time I installed new drivers on my AMD card as well, but when I tried to install the newest drivers it said that it couldn&#39;t find compatible hardware. I had no problems installing downloaded drivers when I first got the card so why am I having them now?

Edit: I seem to have got it. I might have just needed to restart my computer but I shut it off and took the card out and put it back in entirely. In the future, should I uninstall the drivers when installing new ones or just leave them there?</description>

<p>that would have been a problem in windows 98 or Millenium, where drivers are removed or installed using autoexec.bat</p>

            <p>Always uninstall drivers, delete folder of Nvidia, restart the comp and install new drivers. U can also make a clean installation (all setting reseted with previous drivers and (not sure in this place) removing old ones…).</p>

            <p>Actually, I should really roll back my drivers.  The new one keeps crashing.  But the crashes are irregular enough to not warrant me bothering.</p>

            <p>From the NVIDIA website their driver installer does (if you choose to) a clean install (uninstall included). I’ve used it several times without  any problems…</p>
<p>Anyway I know you have it under control…</p>
<p>see ya…</p>

            <p>Just for the record, I think uninstalling drivers (any) before installing different ones is a good idea. Otherwise you may have conflicts between the different driver versions. Just like your hard drive, format is your friend… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>But you allready know this so…</p>

            <p>I’ve always seen it recommended to uninstalled drivers before installing new ones, but I never do and it hasn’t given me any problems so far.</p>
