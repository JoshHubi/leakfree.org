    <title>[Hammer] Dynamic Vertex Buffer error</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hammer-dynamic-vertex-buffer-error/15359</link>
    <description>When attempting to change a prop_static to use props_am\am_server.mdl, Hammer crashes with the following error dialog:

[attach=5727,none,400][/attach]

Not sure what caused this to suddenly happen, but the model loads fine into the in-hammer viewer and clearly works both ingame and back when it was being added to AM and UC. I&#39;m also [i]pretty sure[/i] that the model has far fewer than 27960 verts, so maybe it&#39;s a format issue?

Other variations of the server model work fine, so it&#39;s not a showstopper for what I&#39;m working on, but thought you ought to know.

            <p>Had this problem as well and I’ve been googling for the past half hour for a solution, luckily I’ve stumbled upon the forum again and this time I’ve made an account to give my feedback on this.<br>
Here’s what I’m getting:<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1BdEttJ.png" alt="" width="507" height="179"></p>
<p>It ALWAYS happens in a particular portion of the map I’m working on, but it’s definitely not ‘props_am\am_server.mdl’, since I’m sure that I’m not using the model.<br>
I’ve found two ways of getting around this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some clever use of Visgroups (as a temp fix)</li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-s">Reducing Hammer’s resolution,</span></span><span class="bbcode-s">basically just don’t work on any map that has this bug on fullscreen, but rather in windowed mode. A bit uncomfortable for sure, but it’s definitely better than using visgroups.</span> EDIT1= Nevermind, this doesn’t always works.</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT2 = The model that was causing problems for me was: ‘zombies\zombie_grunt.mdl’ used as a prop_ragdoll. Torso and legs of said model work fine however.</p>
