    <title>&quot;The Walking Dead&quot; TV series</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-walking-dead-tv-series/8321</link>
    <description>Who is your favorite character? Did any of you almost tear up because of any episodes?
I love the fact that its a survival drama and that the characters are soo important. Most zombie movies lack character development and is just based on surviving and nothing else.

The major concern i have is the studio executives fired the main director and main writer of the show (Frank Darabont). I fear that the tv series will suck. If you see his resume you will see how talented he is and the major award winning movies he has directed.

I know i could have posted this topic in another thread but i believe this tv show is way too awesome to be posted in a general thread!!!</description>

            <p>Season one was good.</p>
<p>Season two really irritated me. There was no tension, there was no looming threat of everyone dying, it just bored the hell out of me. Apart from that scene with Daryl at the river, it just seemed really weak in my opinion.</p>

            <p>I watched the first 2 episodes and was getting utterly distracted with it not being the same as the comic, so I kinda didn’t watch any more.  Seems strange to deviate too far from the comic’s story.  As it is already packaged together in some nice bite sized bits, it’s basically a storyboard for the series.</p>
