    <title>Any Optimization tweaks for BM ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/any-optimization-tweaks-for-bm/13161</link>
    <description>Ok ... so i played around some more with BM ... i&#39;ve decided to turn every video setting to low / disabled and play at 1280x720 , i&#39;ve also disabled all the stuff in the visual section of the BM options tab ... and i played up until the freezer area of the office complex ...

Before anyone says anything please NOTE :
-I&#39;ve disabled aero

-i&#39;ve disabled a lot of windows 7 features

-the only thing that start&#39;s up after my laptop boots up is the NVIDIA graphics driver , and i&#39;ve disabled some windows services too


So Fare The first huge lag pops up at the start of unforeseen consequences where there are like ... clouds and stuff going on and at that point it goes below 30 fps

another big one is at that part where you get trapped into a room and then the toom gets field with water and you have to get the hell out ! ... at that point my fps drop to about 17 ... witch is kind of unplayable

and i&#39;ve had some huge lags whenever i would load a save and stuff ...

i&#39;m guessing BM is onother one of those games that loves to eat your CPU ...

anyway to get rid of these ? ... 

Also ... aren&#39;t we missing something here ? NO UPDATES / PATCHES / FIXES ?! NO NOTHING ??!!! For a Mod as Good as BM you would thing that it would constantly get updated ... but i guess not ... and the stuff in the wiki doesn&#39;t really help ...

Any solutions about this ? PLEASE ?! I&#39;ll do anything ... Even Overclocking ... if suggested / necessary ...

If There are Any Updates or patches let me know ... i&#39;ve Downloaded BM From here

<p>If you’re not planning on upgrading anytime soon, try lowering BM’s resolution. That should at least help somewhat. It will undoubtedly look worse, but that’s how I handle these things. BM goes down to 640x480, and at that resolution, the whole game generally runs smoothly, apart from some extremely smokey/particle abusing areas, eg tanks and the Unforseen Consequences elevator break. I used to refuse to play anything below 720p, but because I’ve got an integrated GPU that Game Debate appropriately gave a 2 out of 10, I play everything at 640x480 on low with textures at highest, and at least then I’m guaranteed playable to good performance.</p>

<p>thanks , atleast it’s playable now , i usually always say performance over graphics  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>You can’t try and pull that because 2013 is literally 2007 with some additional OS support. It’s not that Source is badly optimized, Black Mesa just squeezes everything it can out of the engine. From a tech standpoint, the developers actually did an extraordinary job optimizing it.</p>
<p>Source is CPU dependent, but you’re definitely largely at fault for having such weak hardware to begin with. I don’t think your specs were mid-end in 2012, or even in 2009. You could learn to build a PC (it’s not as difficult as it sounds, really) and build a nice one for only a couple hundreds bucks (price doesn’t define power), though I know that’s not everyone’s cup of tea. Trust me, with that hardware, if you plan to play games you’re going to want to upgrade waaaaay sooner than 4 years from now.</p>

</aside>
<p>yeah , but i don’t usually play ultra demanding games , and even then , i don’t go for ultra high stuff , let’s face it , if you are playing an FPS you are most likely gonna look at where to aim and shoot rather then how good the environment looks like … i’ll probably go back to HL:S anyway , since i don’t really like all the changes in BM …</p>

<p>How can you run Crysis 3 but not Black Mesa? Are you trying to use like 16x csaa or something?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>well , the answer is simple , you see , Black Mesa runs on a 7 year old engine and it uses DX9 , it’s not really optimized and it never had any updates or patches</p>
<p>it’s crazy , even on 1280x720 and with everything at low or disabled , in sections where there’s a lot of shit going on screen it can go below 30 fps</p>
<p>as for Crysis 3 , it’s far more optimized then any other game , uses DX11 and it has an engine that is faster when it comes to rendering stuff … so there  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>yeah , that’s what i’m getting at , if source would use more of your gpu then BM would run just fine … not to mention BM uses the 2007 version , where as recent mods use the 2013 one , so …</p>

<p>Maxey’s right. You need a new system. You can <span class="bbcode-i">try</span> to reduce the game’s resolution and lower its settings (you can get a small boot out of it from that).</p>
<p>Anything else will require you to actually tear apart the system and build a new one. Your best bet would be to buy <span class="bbcode-i">parts</span> and build your own machine the next time you decide to upgrade. I’d suggest a budget of around 600-700 USD to start. My system cost me around 1k USD in total (plus the GPU), and I’m still using it and likely will for the next 6-7 years upgrading the system every now and then as necessary until I feel the need to do a full overhaul.</p>
<p>My system can run Crysis 3 on max settings in windowed mode while taking up about 3/4 of my screen. Which is 1960x1080.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh well … i don’t have any plans for upgrading untill then next 4 years or so … i can still run most games at low to mid settings at 60 fps</p>
<p>I Guess i’ll go back to HL1 as i’ve never finished it … i’ve got to office complex and then i found about BM … so i was like … well … let’s give it a try … but then again … BM is more a game of it’s own right then any thing since there are so many changes here and there … it almost doesn’t feal like HL1 anymore … oh well … i guess i’ll leave BM for now … and maybe i’ll pick it up on steam when the full version is out …</p>

<p>I believe your specs are quite weak for the mod in the first place and it also doesn’t help that the mod is a bit more demanding than HL2 as well, so I don’t think there’s more you can do short of making the game really ugly and even then it wouldn’t help that much anyway.</p>
<p>Long story short: get a better computer.</p>

</aside>
<p>well … this was a midend laptop bought in december 2012 … not to mention i can run crysis 3 at low to mid settings ant it works just fine … i’ll agree my CPU is crap … but then again , games should focus more on using your GPU … Also … there’s a "MultiCore Rendering option in the advanced video tab … that should help … but i can’t find any way to enable it as there is no drop down menu … also … if there is a way to get dx11 going … let me know … and if none of this works … then i guess i’ll stick with good old HL1 , as i know of a few mods that can make it look decent enough to where it’s no longer full of pixels …</p>

            <p>Ok … so i played around some more with BM … i’ve decided to turn every video setting to low / disabled and play at 1280x720 , i’ve also disabled all the stuff in the visual section of the BM options tab … and i played up until the freezer area of the office complex …</p>
<p>Before anyone says anything please NOTE :<br>
-I’ve disabled aero</p>
<p>-i’ve disabled a lot of windows 7 features</p>
<p>-the only thing that start’s up after my laptop boots up is the NVIDIA graphics driver , and i’ve disabled some windows services too</p>
<p>So Fare The first huge lag pops up at the start of unforeseen consequences where there are like … clouds and stuff going on and at that point it goes below 30 fps</p>
<p>another big one is at that part where you get trapped into a room and then the toom gets field with water and you have to get the hell out ! … at that point my fps drop to about 17 … witch is kind of unplayable</p>
<p>and i’ve had some huge lags whenever i would load a save and stuff …</p>
<p>i’m guessing BM is onother one of those games that loves to eat your CPU …</p>
<p>anyway to get rid of these ? …</p>
<p>Also … aren’t we missing something here ? NO UPDATES / PATCHES / FIXES ?! NO NOTHING !!! For a Mod as Good as BM you would thing that it would constantly get updated … but i guess not … and the stuff in the wiki doesn’t really help …</p>
<p>Any solutions about this ? PLEASE ?! I’ll do anything … Even Overclocking … if suggested / necessary …</p>
<p>If There are Any Updates or patches let me know … i’ve Downloaded BM From here</p>
