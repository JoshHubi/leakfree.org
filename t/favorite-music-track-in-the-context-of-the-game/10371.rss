    <title>Favorite music track in the context of the game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/favorite-music-track-in-the-context-of-the-game/10371</link>
    <description>My favorite music track for it&#39;s environment is the On a Rail intro, because just as the music picks up pace, the chapter title appears. Perfect.

although it is not my favorite song from the whole soundtrack to actually listen to

When have you been wowed or blown away by the placement/direction of music within the context of BM for specific areas?</description>

<p>Surface Tension 3. Pure Fear. I didn’t forsee them merging those two sections together, the Snarks were a fucking Ruse and I fell for it.</p>

            <p>Two areas I thought needed some action music were when you get to the first tank where there are multiple manholes that you can come out of. The other area was where the osprey was lowering soldiers and you had to load the missile launcher to blow up the tank.</p>
<p>Just to try it out, in the background I loaded up Hard Technology Rock and Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar from the original game in these areas and it was awesome! It made the game seem even more like Half-Life.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">In no particular order:</span><br>
The music at the QE ambush<br>
The music at the start of On a Rail<br>
The music which starts when you drop out of the vent and run away from the second Garg (such a cool moment)<br>
And lastly, the music after you kill the first Garg. I thought this moment was so well done. Loved it.</p>

            <p>On a side note: did anyone notice that the “Mesa Remix” of the Black Mesa Theme is just the inverted version of the original one (i.e. if you play it backwards sounds like the original)? Or it was just me who didn’t know?</p>

            <p>“Inbound”. Probably due to its psychological connection to the moment of excitement of finally be able to run BM for the very first time.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
Also it’s very creepy… somehow preannounces that it won’t be an “ordinary day” for the poor chap. :retard:</p>
<p>I also liked the old “On A Rail” track. The sound reminded me of the music of Deus Ex and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oE8heI-Ozc#at=1m23s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">UT99</a>, especially when the synth <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVS-CJMoCeI#at=34s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">kicks in</a>.</p>
<p>[Note: I’m playing very slowly in these days, just finished Surface Tension, so from what I’m reading the best is yet to come…]</p>

            <p>The one in We’ve Got Hostiles is my total favorite, so epic.</p>
<p>That would be followed up by QE1, and then ST1</p>

            <p>I know this is shitty to say, and I’ll probably try posting something constructive on it later, but I literally could not stand 80 to 90 percent of the new music. Everytime a song played I found myself wondering what the hell they were thinking. Anyway, sorry, I apologize, and I will post some constructive comments on the soundtrack later, but, as it stands, I just want desperately to put the original music back in</p>
<p>Nevertheless,<br>
The track that plays as you enter the giant conveyor room from residue processing was <span class="bbcode-i">phenomenal</span>. It was so good I replayed the two or so minutes section five or six times.</p>
<p>The ambient track the plays in the grunt-pod room at the beginning of questionable ethics was flawlessly executed as well.</p>
<p>But…other than that…</p>

            <p>I love all the music in this game, but here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ol>
<li>The introduction song that plays while riding the train. Inbound sequence. Feels great.</li>
<li>The ambient song that plays in Unforeseen Consequences.</li>
<li>Music that plays while the giant monster with three tentacles is being burned.</li>
<li>The ambush theme in Questionable Ethics.</li>
<li>The train ride theme in “On a Rail” sequence.</li>
</ol>
<p>And, of course, the Black Mesa main theme  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I still have to complete the game though, so I’ll listen to more themes as I progress further.</p>

            <p>My favorites are Unforseen Consequences, Questionable Ethics, and Forget About Freeman. For the latter, the entire scene where it plays is utterly spectacular.</p>
<p>Edit: What I really hated about that scene though was that there were some ospreys flying over at first, and maybe some other details, that I never really got a good look at, since I was so preoccupied with the horde of marines.</p>

            <p>Like bloodshot, my favourite music track in the context of the game was definitely “Questionable Ethics 1”. SO awesome, when that great song began and the marines started raining down on me. LOVED the hell out of it. I died the first three times (or so) playing that part, but the music made up for it. So it was a total win/win situation: Either I succeed, or I get to listen to that song again.<br>
Other favourite songs: Blast Pit 3, Surface Tension 3, Forget about Freeman, End Credits and, of course, the Black Mesa theme. So awesome. I continuesly listen to it for two days now, so in the end, I just bought the soundtrack.</p>

            <p>In order of my favorites</p>
<p>Questionable Ethics 1. That song with the part that played was amazing.</p>
<p>The tank battle in Forget about Freeman with that song playing, then the Surface Tension Cliff</p>
<p>theme, really cool after stepping out of that pipe, followed by the “trailer” theme at the gargantua chase, and finally the We’ve got Hostiles</p>
<p>part where you rise up to the surface and fight the HECU with mortars bearing down.</p>
<p>Honorable mention: the suit retrieval theme was pretty cool, especially because I never liked the original suit theme in HL1 that much.</p>
<p>The cut On a Rail track from the old gameplay, It doesn’t count here since I had to manually put it in though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
