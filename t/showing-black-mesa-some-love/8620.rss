Thought posting in &quot;Show off&quot; was the next best thing I could do so that I could share my enthusiasm with you. Our website&#39;s support is behind you, so let us know if we can ever help  :wink: 

Best regards,

<blockquote>
<p>After leaving their Twitter account untouched for over a year, the developers behind the Half-Life Source reboot, Black Mesa, have resurfaced.</p>
<p>Announcing their new Facebook page earlier today, the Black Mesa Devs are back on the grid. While they can’t say much more about the mod than the fact that it’ll be released “when it’s done”, fans are excited to hear from this project after its first announcement over three years ago.</p>
<p>“Black Mesa is a re-imagining of Half-Life, the game by Valve Software that changed the industry over a decade ago”, the official description on their facebook page reads. “Utilizing the modern Source engine and its powerful visual and design features, Black Mesa will throw you into the world that started the Half-Life continuum and introduced Gordon Freeman, the gun-toting, bullet-dodging Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics.”</p>
<p>When the game is finally completed, it will be completely free and only require a game that runs on the source engine and includes the Source SDK Base. Considering Team Fortress 2 does so and is free-to-play, anyone will be able to snag this mod if it gets a green light by Valve.</p>
