<blockquote>
<p>I conceptualized and built Polaris in about 2 weeks, back in January 2009. Then it was 5 months of on-and-off testing and polishing. It’s probably the most personal level in this pack, inspired by a good ol’ dose of young unrequited love and romantic troubles.</p>
<p>It was the second “fivetwelve” I made, a personal challenge to make a small self-contained level within an area of 512 x 512 units (the real world equivalent of 40 x 40 feet). Most of my levels spiral out of control when I decide to keep extending onto hallways and adding additional rooms, so this size limit helped me focus on the game mechanics. Originally, I planned Polaris as a giant sprawling forest, and you use the stars to navigate through it - except I prototyped a giant forest and the result wasn’t very interesting, and I found I had no control over the player to teach them the required skills.</p>
<p>All first person shooters consists of two basic verbs: looking and moving. Mirror’s Edge brought on a lot of discussion about the “moving” aspect of an FPS, and it seems we’re headed towards some holy grail of body awareness with that - but what about the “looking” aspect? (To my knowledge, no one other than Valve pays attention as to how to go about directing the player’s gaze, whether through Alyx being blinded by a flashlight, NPCs pointing, or birds flying somewhere.) The “looking” verb usually has no cost associated with it, no power - it is a passive action on the part of the player. So how about we attach some more significance to the act of looking in an FPS? Can “looking at stuff” be fun too? In an FPS, shooting and looking are basically the same verb anyway.</p>
<p>That’s where stargazing comes in. It’s still passive… and to many, it’s still boring. Which leads me to what I consider my failures in Polaris - it’s not very “fun” and the tasks and instructions are still very game-like. “Do this. Look at that. Do that.” It’s all basically one big tutorial level until the end, when Dylan disappears and the player finally has to make a decision for himself. Originally I had less overt instruction, and it was embedded within the text of the narrative more - but playtesters would get confused. “Do I click on the Big Dipper?” So yes, my biggest regret about Polaris is the “game” part.</p>
<p>I’m also interested in education as a career, so one thing I’m doing with Radiator is demonstrating how I think educational games should be built: you incorporate the skill directly into a “regular” video game. You learn how to find north with the stars by running into a situation where you need it. (The Big Dipper method taught in Polaris actually works in real-life throughout the Northern Hemisphere, by the way.) You learn arithmetic by calculating the optimal DPS for your character in World of Warcraft. You learn about history and economics by playing Civilization 4 and realizing that mercantilism is impractical in the late game and how global trade is just so much better… What you don’t do is digitize some flash cards and sell a glorified Powerpoint presentation as an educational game, as much of the educational game industry is doing today because that doesn’t let you model or test understanding and thus it fails as education.</p>
<p>But I think I had the most success in establishing mood. It’s relatively quiet and somber - and this comes through in the endings. There are three: (1) You leave early, perhaps even a minute into the game. The narrator regrets not staying. (2) You go north, where Dylan confesses he doesn’t really “believe” in stargazing so much as its romantic power. The narrator goes home with him and they break up. (3) You don’t go north, and Dylan calls you a bitch, and you break up… One playtester lamented that he wasn’t able to reach the “good” ending - and I think that’s a false promise offered in many games. In real-life you might do the “right thing” all the time and you’re lucky if you get good results from it. Plus, I was still kind of pissed off about how my last semi-relationship ended, so I wanted to make something pessimistic.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I don’t like how HWC turned out at all. At its core, the gameplay consists of crawling around and moving crates. It’s really quite awful… but at this point, I’ve worked too long on it to simply let it drift away, so I decided to polish this turd until it’s pretty shiny and set it off into the wild. The scope of HWC definitely exploded out of control, and in its current state it’s an absolute mess. I never want to open the map up in the editor again. Mein gott.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People complained how Polaris needed voice acting. Well, be careful what you wish for… I really wish I had time (and the motivation) to re-write the script and do another recording session, but the whole process of recording / cleaning up / lip-syncing just takes way too much time. I don’t think I’m going to do voice acting of this scope (~50 lines of dialog I think?) ever again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Polaris was about the short story, then HWC is about theater, “the short play.” As level designers we constantly rely on artifice to keep the player “immersed” (I hate that word, by the way) - some things work worse than others (e.g. perpetually locked doors) but I think a lot of level designers need to realize that REALISM IS NOT DESIRABLE. Realism is a means, not a goal; and the key to good level design is to incorporate just enough realism that the player won’t really question it - in other words, we build sets and populate them with actors and props. Complete and robust simulations of entire worlds, or at least things that claim to be (<em>cough</em> Oblivion) always fall short of their lofty ambitions, so the solution is to not even try. Or to try and fail repeatedly. But modern theater doesn’t even try to be “realistic” in this traditional sense, so why not embrace the artificiality of a set? This is mostly a problem in FPS’s, which are fixated on visual fidelity and blah blah blah I don’t care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Half-Life 2 was the launching point for the concept of HWC; throughout the game you find these small hidden caches of supply crates in hard-to-reach areas. From a narrative perspective, it makes you wonder, who bothered to climb all the way up there and stash the crate there? I planned a level called “Caching” which revolved around going around City 17, with the goal to stash crates in random places without breaking them. However, I ran smack dab into one of my own rules (“Don’t use City 17”) and the setting didn’t seem very interesting anyway, so I moved it to a Psychonauts-style abstraction of some guy’s brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other major influence for HWC is Flashbang Studios’ excellent Minotaur China Shop. I liked the idea of channeling “failure” into an alternate objective - that way everyone wins!.. Kind of. But then I ran into a problem of mixed feedback. From a narrative perspective, the therapist would want you to break all those crates and “release” all your pent-up emotions… but then I attached lots of negative buzzes and sounds to mark it as undesirable… Of course, one Mr. Maidlaw interpreted the progressive destruction as a “reward” - and maybe it is? I don’t even know anymore. All I know is that it’s problematic and that’s what’s kind of interesting about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are three endings, as in Polaris - (1) leave early, (2) get divorced, (3) stay together. They’re all kind of the same (with a different ending monologue from Dylan) because I figure most players won’t play through HWC more than once, so why should I waste my time crafting a special ending that no one will see or even distinguish? Also, I don’t think “divorce” is really so bad - what if it’s the right thing to do? If you read the signs in Central Repression, you see that James kind of has some issues… and James isn’t really a sympathetic character at all. (Then again neither is Dylan. And everyone hates the therapist) - so instead of seeing it as a trite binary of “good ending = married” and “bad ending = divorced” why not wonder if divorce is really the better option for both of them? I wish I had more time to record more dialogue for Dylan to flesh out the backstory for the couple, but alas, I’m too fucking tired of this particular project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also tried to be funny in this one, with the crazy amount of signs and the magazines and all the hopefully smart funny writing and all that. Video game levels in industrial / sci-fi settings are OBSESSED with caution stripes. They’re everywhere. It’s almost worse than the perpetually locked door. I wanted to point out how ridiculous this was, but also communicate how fragile the crates are, all while addressing any localization issues by including all these languages.</p>

<li>
<p>A joke the European players might not understand - the “Internal Repression Service” is like the American government’s tax collection agency, the “Internal Revenue Service.” It is both the most efficient government agency and also the most reviled. I based my own seal off of the real IRS seal - plus their ACTUAL motto is so breathtakingly evil: “Service plus enforcement equals compliance.” Devoid of emotion, devoid of sympathy… ladies and gentleman, the tax collector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gay marriage, a hot topic. I didn’t really set out to make something political, and I don’t think HWC is… but given the revelation (for some) that Dylan likes men, it makes you wonder what’s going on in Polaris…</p>

<p>Even campaignjunkie thinks  his mod is shit. He says himself that he hates both mod installments and only released the second installment because he had already put so much work in to it. Posting that quote just killed your own argument.</p>
<p>He is fooling people. He promises all this stuff.  People see death metal in the description and think, oh, I like death metal, so they dl Radiator only to find it has absolutely nothing to do with death metal. In the case of piano a piano fan might play through the whole game looking for the piano, only to find that the piano mentioned in the description was referring to a short sound track at the very end of the game. That would piss me off a lot. In FEAR Project Origin there is a zombie playing the piano in one scene, FEAR Project Origin must be about piano.</p>

Do that.” It’s all basically one big tutorial level until the end, when Dylan disappears and the player finally has to make a decision for himself. Originally I had less overt instruction, and it was embedded within the text of the narrative more - but playtesters would get confused. “Do I click on the Big Dipper?” So yes, my biggest regret about Polaris is the “game” part.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like how HWC turned out at all. At its core, the gameplay consists of crawling around and moving crates. It’s really quite awful… but at this point, I’ve worked too long on it to simply let it drift away, so I decided to polish this turd until it’s pretty shiny and set it off into the wild. The scope of HWC definitely exploded out of control, and in its current state it’s an absolute mess. I never want to open the map up in the editor again. Mein gott.”</p>

<p>ie the mapping and creativity was impressive but the mod was very boring/what I’ve said already. Who really cares if the mapping is good if the mod itself isn’t fun? If something is boring, then no matter how pretty it is it is still an epic fail.</p>

          <p>Ah, I knew I had seen a thread about Radiator before. I think I’ll repeat what I said in the other thread I posted in, but I’m not going to worry about spoilers, since there have already been a truckload of spoilers in this thread. If what Imonfire posted about the developer notes, then many of my points are going to be a little redundant, but most of the point I’m making here isn’t WHAT the problems with the mod are, but WHY they are problems. I’ll be expanding on my original post from the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=1210" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Good Mods ruined by certain things</a> thread for this purpose.</p>
<p>Radiator 1-2: Polaris and Handle with Care</p>
<p>This game was perhaps the freshest takes I’ve seen on an FPS. Polaris was excellent, though slightly marred by the fact that I felt absolutely no connection to any of the characters. The main character was a bitch and Dylan was actually kind of a douche, seeing how he brought her(I’m assuming the main character is female because the gender of the main character remains ambiguous within this section) out on a date she has absolutely no interest in, and then left her there to find her own way back without actually SAYING what direction he was going to go. The only clue that he went north is that he had been constantly telling you to find north. North is just a reference point, it doesn’t mean every single thing we’re looking for is in that direction.<br>
Furthermore, the endings all pretty much amounted to the same thing whether you completed the game successfully or not, leaving you questioning the point of why you even bothered playing it at all.(not a good feeling to be left with upon completing a game) Despite all this, I was given the impression that the section was supposed to have some sort of emotional impact.<br>
Still, I can forgive these points for the fresh gameplay that Polaris implemented.</p>
<p>The Handle with Care section is the part that bugs me the most. The fundamental premise of HwC seems to be that you are tasked with repressing troubled memories inside your head during a marriage counseling session in order for your relationship with your gay lover to survive.<br>
The first issue that struck me was that a male specific name was used for the main character. There are a number of gender neutral names (like Lee/Leigh, Casey, Kim, Parker, Alex/Alyx, etc) that would have allowed the gender to be interpreted by the player; either playing as a girl in a straight relationship or as a guy in a gay relationship. I have nothing against any person for being homosexual, but at the same time I have no interest in supporting homosexuality as a lifestyle. As a result, this issue made it pretty much impossible to immerse myself in the character I was supposed to be playing as.<br>
That is only a minor issue compared to the flawed foundation on which the entire HwC section is based. In order to “win” you have to repress memories by moving boxes to shelves where they are sealed off. If you break any of these boxes, it results in an outburst during the counseling session, and if repeated often enough, results in the relationship ending.<br>
There is no possible way that a person could have a healthy relationship that requires repressing memories. A healthy relationship is based on communication, and only a complete quack in the field of relation counseling would think otherwise, yet throughout the entire game you are praised by the counselor for repression and chastised for any outbursts. I was left doubting and rejecting the entire premise of both the game setting and game play involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There are three endings, as in Polaris - (1) leave early, (2) get divorced, (3) stay together. They’re all kind of the same (with a different ending monologue from Dylan) because I figure most players won’t play through HWC more than once, so why should I waste my time crafting a special ending that no one will see or even distinguish? Also, I don’t think “divorce” is really so bad - what if it’s the right thing to do? If you read the signs in Central Repression, you see that James kind of has some issues… and James isn’t really a sympathetic character at all. (Then again neither is Dylan. And everyone hates the therapist)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Now here, it’s pointed out that part of the object of the game IS to actually question whether or not the relationship even SHOULD survive. That’s great and all, except that there isn’t any question about it now. As I pointed out already, if a relationship requires repressing memories instead of talking them out, it’s not a relationship. The game has now shot itself in the foot as the method to REALLY winning is to NOT PLAY. For an art piece, this is a brilliant concept, but even the most novice game developer should be able to recognize the fatal flaw in designing a game that encourages you to NOT play it.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>so instead of seeing it as a trite binary of “good ending = married” and “bad ending = divorced” why not wonder if divorce is really the better option for both of them? I wish I had more time to record more dialogue for Dylan to flesh out the backstory for the couple, but alas, I’m too fucking tired of this particular project.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The fundamental underlying problem is shown pretty well right here. The developer focused too much on keeping the ending reward/consequence from being “trite” and forgot one of the fundamental principles of game design is for effort of the player to be REWARDED and lack of effort or skill to be met with CONSEQUENCES. If he really wanted to show that divorce could actually be considered the “good ending” then getting that ending should have required skill and effort as well or instead.<br>
Ultimately Radiator:Handle with Care shows itself as being highly polished with unique and well implemented metaphorical gameplay mechanics that could have been truly thought provoking , but since the metaphor upon which the gameplay is based is erroneous,(either in terms of rules of successful relationships or rules of successful gameplay) the gameplay goes from being intuitive to counter intuitive.</p>

          <p>Wait this thread isn’t deleted? Anyway it was an interesting read, Acumen and I mostly agree with you. Especially on the part where you say that the gameplay is counter-intuitive instead of being intuitive. On my first playthrough I didn’t stack any boxes, because I accidentally dropped the first one then saw that something happened. A cut-scene to be more precise. Then I just said thought that I was supposed to “delete” bad memories so he can forget and get over them.</p>
<p>Then on my second play I saw those little numbers on the screens and on the walls, so I guessed I had to stack them in the corresponding spaces. Unfortunately I wasn’t (and I am still not) able to stack them all as some of them were almost unreachable.</p>
<p>I also found strange the fact that when you “successfully” repressed memories, you we’re given bad feedback from the marriage counselor, which incited me a bit to destroy those memory boxes.</p>

          <p>I have actually successfully stacked all the boxes. The trick to this is that as long as you are careful, it is possible to set boxes down and pick it up later. You can pick up boxes that are in your way, take them off the shelf and leave yourself a completely clear path. Occasionally you also need to make use of the few barrels that are in the area to reach sections that are too high to jump to.</p>
<p>Oh, and you don’t get bad feedback when you successfully repress memories, you get bad feedback when you break the boxes, which isn’t how you repress memories, it’s how they break loose and result in an outburst on the subject. She’s actually chastising you for letting out the issues that you apparently need to talk about. In order to repress memories, you have to get the box into its proper place on the shelves.</p>

          <p>I can’t wait for it.</p>
<p>As far as the game went I got all the endings, mostly by just fucking around the first time and then going back and doing it right the second. And it was awesome. I enjoyed it more than most of the ‘LOOK, A NEW MAP’ mods.</p>
<p>As far as the majority of complaints about it I have read in this thread: They didn’t bug me, I don’t care.</p>

          <p>I usually don’t post in threads about Radiator because I firmly believe that it doesn’t matter what I think… but seeing as BMS used to be my home turf, I feel compelled to “grace you with my presence.”</p>
<p>to the haters: It’s okay. But just keep in mind that there’s a reason why you can leave the clearing in Polaris or go through the exit door in HwC, at almost any time – if you don’t like it, leave. The exit is always there.</p>
<p>Grey Acumen: I find straightforward books, movies, and games to be boring. Yes, obscurity does not equate to subtlety, but at the same time I’d rather err on the side of David Lynch than Dan Brown.</p>
<p>re: gender neutral name – No. It’s about two gay dudes. I’m sorry it confuses and upsets you. I’m still not sure why this is a flaw.</p>
<p>re: “losing” being too easy to be rewarding – this is where I think you and the reviewer at Destructoid don’t quite understand what’s happening here:</p>
<ol>
<li>You’re imposing your own values of what a “healthy relationship should be” – do you read “Pride and Prejudice” and condemn 19th century English women for not going out to get a job?</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you ever been in a relationship and wondered whether honesty is really the best policy? Why do you think so much infidelity goes on in the world, if the ethics are really so clear-cut? It’s not as obvious as it seems.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Here’s how I always thought of it: the therapist praises James for repressing a memory because that’s when James bites his tongue and gives the appearance of progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much like the “leap” at the end of Polaris, it’s up to the player to make this other “leap,” that they might as well just break boxes instead of bothering with the farce that is therapy (or at least James thinks it’s a farce)… and if they never make that leap, that’s fine, because that’s also a valid world view.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The boxes ramp fairly evenly in difficulty (though L3 is harder to provoke a crisis, that the player will inevitably break a few and get a bit frustrated) and at the end you get a fairly rewarding feeling when you realize you have to walk on the spotlight scaffold in order to get the last box repressed (there’s probably other solutions, but that’s the one I intended)</p>
<p>The problem is probably that I don’t hold your hand. You have to realize all the strategies yourself by interacting with the system: to move boxes out of the way beforehand, to use the blue barrels to prop yourself up, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, I mod because I like modding. It’s not to please anyone.</p>
<p>Though it does entertain me when people get agitated.</p>
