            <p>APB runs decently on my rig. By “decently,” I mean the gameplay is relatively stable unless I’m driving fast. Then buildings start drawing late and I run into a wall that is invisible save for a ladder indicating the presence of a wall that hasn’t drawn in yet.</p>

            <p>Question, can you actually run APB right now? It’s fucked over with random FPS drops and other weird crap, I can run every game I own on max (Except skyrim which has AA turned off) but APB is a POS no matter what settings I use. The game has been getting increasingly more unstable as time goes on.</p>

            <p>Woo hoo, huge necro.</p>
<p>Anyway, I finally decided to download the F2P APB, since I found a connection that allows me to play for a while in a nearby coffee shop.</p>
<p>Things have improved. Vehicle handling in particular. But what really irks me is the customization for characters. Putting more than three decals on an article of clothing is locked to Premium, so I can no longer put obscene amounts of time into the character creator tricking out threads.</p>
<p>APB’s main <span class="bbcode-i">draw</span> was the customization tools. I get that in order to make a profit, they had to lock something off. Heck, I think it’s pretty smart. The shooting and driving aren’t that good, so make those free and premium character mods.</p>
<p>Even so, isn’t only three decals per thread a bit low? It’s tough to make any kind of creative design with just three decals.</p>

            <p>Do you corner pop? Or sit in the open(near cover obviously)? Both are fine, but if you find yourself doing the latter, you probably want the Obeya(unless you’ve tried it and don’t like it). The HVR is good in big battles, and for fighting hackers, cause you can deal obscene damage while always having cover. Otherwise though, the Obeya kills in half the time, and you can run with it.</p>

            <p>Both. I usually fucking run around with the HVR shooting people if it’s 2vs 2 or less.</p>
<p>When it gets to 6vs 6 (Bigass fights), I just camp around shootin people in cover using that convenient protruding hitbox.</p>

            <p>The OBIR gets pooped on by almost every other gun in the game, it’s like one space away from the useless category. Now Quick<span class="bbcode-b">scoping</span> or <span class="bbcode-b">switching</span>? Cause Quickswitching makes people rage, quickscoping implies that you are in a position to get your ass handed to you on a silver platter.</p>
<p>Personally I like the Obeya, and currently the JG with Spray and Pray 3. I used to use the joker all the time, before it became popular.</p>

            <p>My friend used an OBIR before it came to steam. Pretty fun weapon to use. I used the HVR (sniper) though, quickscoping (it’s possible) with that shit makes people rage so hard.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it’s good fun so long as everything works right.</p>
<p>A massive word of warning over the next few days guys, On colby atleast, we are starting to ride the next wave of hacks. This is a normal, so far unavoidable issue and G1 has been super good about dealing with these people eventually. It’s a bunch of forever alone faggots who want to shut the game down again, but most of them seem to have given up.</p>
<p>When you do see hacks, just ride it out or come back in a few days. Oh, some other advice, Weekends are the worst times for cheating. Weekends, and LATE nights. If you are lucky enough to have a work schedule that allows it, weekday mornings are usually the best times to play. Basically if you can get on while the kiddies are at school, you will have the best chance at missing the majority of the cheats.</p>
<p>Oh, hahaha and one other thing, anyone who uses an OBIR is probably cheating. Last night an OBIR baby came in, and I lol’d to myself and thought “Heh, they are probably cheating”. Over the next little while I thought how silly it was to judge someone’s legitimacy over what weapon they use. It was at that moment that I walked up to a courner, peeked around with the camera and they started shooting at me before I ever stepped out. :lol:</p>
<p>That is… four? OBIRs that I have seen IN A ROW, that are obviously cheating. Of course, even with it being lazer accurate it’s still a shit weapon, so just treat it like a DMR that they can run with, and rofl as you stomp them.</p>

<p>And the game runs fine, it just gave me shit the first time I tried to run it for some reason.  Care to share your ini tweaks?  Or some pointers on what to change in them?  I’m not a fan of the increased bloom, so I’d definitely turn that off, but that’s easily done in the config menu.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s nice to stave off paranoia, but it’s rarely detrimenal to your game. I’ve been F2P for a while now, and the four minute timer is almost always quicker than my running out of bullets. Also, there looks to be new modifications in the works which will allow f2p players to have a faster cooldown too.</p>

<p>If you think these are bad, you should have tried in RTW. They all drove the same, and all were on ice. Personally I liked it, but I like these cars even more.</p>

            <p>Actually it’s really not. Nothing on the cash shop can’t be outdone(mods) by the free weapons in their class, except the CSG, and the DMR thing.</p>
<p>Of course, the CSG is a shotgun so it’s pretty much outdone by everything else, and the DMR(LOL) is a DMR and shouldn’t really be classified as a weapon as much as a prop for taking screenshots.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, they buggered the graphics up real nice. My machine used to run RTW APB at max, with absolutely no issue, and now I run this on minimum, with a million INI tweaks shutting off every other tiny bit of graphics just so I can drive through the middle of town without dropping below 25 FPS.</p>
<p>That’s not to say they havn’t done some good things. They made the vehicles better and more unique to drive, Fight club is pretty awesome seeing as they just dropped it on us a few days ago, and the LtL nerf they put in place was actually my suggestion. Matchmaking does need some work, but they fixed it up a bit too compared to how it was. Also, cheaters. They have flattened them on a couple occations. Unfourtunately without Hardware bans, they always come leaking back in after a while, but whatever, atleast they are sometimes under control, unlike any other time in APB’s existance.</p>
<p>What guns are you using Bob? Oh, and what server are you on? If you’re on Colby I can set you up with Happy landings 3, it is essential, and you can’t seriously play fight club without it.</p>

            <p>I gave it a try today, and it has potential.  Not a fan of how, right out of the tutorial, I went to do a mission, and it threw another guy in with me for the same objective.  I wouldn’t plan to play the game alone, that would defeat the purpose, but it forced him into my group, and then when our wanted level got high enough, it threw some higher level guy at us who completely destroyed us.</p>
<p>IMO, they need to do a bit more balancing, at least with the matchmaking aspect.</p>
<p>Also, when I tried to run it, it told me my video card wasn’t good enough.  Go to run it a second time, and no complaints.  WTF O_o</p>

            <p>Yeah, neither does anyone who played it originally. They shouldn’t have mucked with the combat at all, imo. Just hammered that stupid CCG into the ground and disable quickswitching, that’s ALL they had to do. No one ever complained about the combat.</p>
