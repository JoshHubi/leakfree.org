    <title>FormZ as a game map creation program?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/formz-as-a-game-map-creation-program/3085</link>
    <description>I always wanted to try my hand at creating maps for games, i.e. HL2 or whatnot.  I was forced to get FormZ for my education, so I was wondering if I could use this instead of, say, Valve Hammer or Blender, to create maps and export it elsewhere.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The problem is that each room in Hammer will look smaller in-game than in real life, so you’d have to scale up the architecture a bit in order to make it look natural.</p>

<p>I am an architecture student, and I do quite a bit of work in things like Sketchup and Revit.  Is there a game editor that I can bring those models into to edit and create walkthroughs??</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You can export Sketchup to Blender or Hammer. I wouldn’t recommend the latter though- it’s not too pretty.</p>

            <p>You couldn’t use the program for sole creation of levels, as mentioned, but you probably could create environmental assets that would be too complicated/detailed to make in Hammer and import them to add to your levels.</p>

<p>The most you could do is make a level and import it as a prop_static, but the lighting would be weird and it would cause a leak.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well you could just stuff the entire prop_static into a box in Hammer.</p>
<p>Then you’d have a helluva lot of optimization problems.</p>

            <p>Instead of Blender, yes, but not instead of hammer. Hammer is a brush based level making program, whereas formz is a 3d modelling program.</p>
