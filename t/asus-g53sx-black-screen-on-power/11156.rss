    <title>Asus G53SX black screen on power</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/asus-g53sx-black-screen-on-power/11156</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve had this laptop for a year now and recently it&#39;s been doing this thing a lot where after it goes to sleep in my backpack when I try to wake it up the light up keyboard flashes on and it makes some noise then goes silent and the keyboard dims and the screen doesn&#39;t come on.

I think this is somehow related to peripherals plugged into the laptop as it just happened to me and I took out the battery and put it back in and tried this about 5 times unsuccessfully. Then I plugged in my headphones (to listen for startup sound, I was in a quiet study lounge) and it boots perfectly. Also, the first time I noticed this it was remedied when I removed an sd to microsd converter I had left in the sdcard slot. Anyone have any ideas?</description>
