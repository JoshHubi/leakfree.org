<p>Well then change every instance I mention draw distance to LOD scaling.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, it needs to be fixed before it’s ported.</p>

            <p>Crysis did the same strange pixelation pop-in thing, and I always wondered why because it was clearly visible. Not sure if it worked the same in Crysis 2 retail, but I remember noticing it in one of the CE3 techdemos:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6a6tUIA7LA&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=101s" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6a6tUIA7LA&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=101s</a></p>
<p>You can see the barrel on the dock further down “materialize” sort of, from a bunch of pixels, that’s what you mean right?</p>

            <p>I know I have. They tend to ‘grain’ or ‘pixel’ in more so than ‘pop’. You could see pixels of the object begin to form and the closer you get the fuller the object gets, the farther away, the grainier it gets until it is gone.</p>
<p>I don’t mean the object gets pixelated in the usual sense. It’s almost like the object desolves pixel by pixel.</p>
<p>Also, the “long” draw-distance is more for the landscape and scenery, such as those aerial battles everywhere, rather than things that actually matter.</p>

            <p>I would hope they would both be ported and bundled with each other. After all, odst did come with a complete collection of all halo 3 DLC.</p>

            <p>If they do port them, I would like them to improve the draw-distance. God, that shit is awful.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’ll make 'em do it.</p>
<p>I think it’d take just a teeny tiny bit more than a hundred people to have them “waste” their precious resources to cater the game to it’s original fanbase.</p>

            <p>Yeah.<br>
Nice idea, but shit, they underestimated severely. Even if we do eventually get Halo 3, I couldn’t imagine Halo 4 PC happening for years.</p>
