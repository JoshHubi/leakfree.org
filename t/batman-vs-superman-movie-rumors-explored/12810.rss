    <title>Batman vs. Superman movie rumors explored</title>

    <description>It’s every DC fan’s dream come true: a Batman vs. Superman movie. Ostensibly, it will be a sequel to Man of Steel, but viewers can be sure there will be plenty of Batman time onscreen, too. One blog, CinemaBlend.com, has followed the developments behind one of 2015’s most looked-forward-to movies. According to its sources, the movie was first announced at Comic-Con by Warner Bros., though there was no synopsis provided which gave a hint as to what the plot will be about.

[b]Friends or foes?[/b]

One thing most frequently rumored, however, is that “Superman and Batman will be enemies before they become friends.” We already know Henry Cavill will be the Superman, reprising his role from Man of Steel, and he’ll likely be continuing to try to figure out his place on Earth. CinemaBlend.com also suggested he’ll be dealing with the fallout from his battle with his nemesis in the last movie, along with the repercussions of leveling half of Metropolis.

[b]Superman actors confirmed[/b]

In a press release, Warner Bros. also confirmed the return of “Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and Diane lane as Martha Kent.” However, we have yet to know how these characters will fit into the 2015 story or how big a role they’ll be playing. CinemaBlend.com guessed that there will be further exploration of Clark and Lois’s relationship, plenty of scenes spent at the newspaper, and some sort of return to Smallville.

[b]Batman actor selected[/b]

Batman, on the other hand, is a new face to the DC scene: After a month of auditioning, Ben Affleck was chosen to play this iconic role. This version of the Dark Knight has been described as a veteran hero who is “tired and weary and seasoned.” No other Batman actors have been confirmed, leaving it open to debate as to whether we’ll need a new actor for Alfred or Commissioner Gordon.

[b]Wonder woman appearance?[/b]

There may also be a third DC hero to hit the screen in the Man of Steel sequel. Rumors swirl around a possible Wonder Woman appearance, sparked by an interview with star Jaimie Alexander who said she “has had a meeting with DC Comics about possible projects.” Other actresses named as possible candidates for the role of Diana Prince are Elodie Yung, Gal Gadot, and Olga Kurylenko.

Whatever the eventual decisions on casting and plot line, you can be certain the 2015 movie will be a blockbuster hit. In the mean time if you’re having DC withdrawals, you might be interested in the adult footed pajamas sold by Jumpin Jammerz which come in a variety of patterns, styles, and colors, including Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.
