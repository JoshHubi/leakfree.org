    <title>terrible model clipping</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/terrible-model-clipping/9897</link>
    <description>Hello, i just downloaded and loaded up Black Messa for the first time. I had it on the lowest settings possible for best performance, and noticed severe model clipping all over the place in the initial train ride.

I tried upping the settings gradually, until i was at near max settings. My computer was still running it mostly fine, with little lag, but the clipping was still all over the place.

What can i do to fix this?

Thanks in advance</description>
