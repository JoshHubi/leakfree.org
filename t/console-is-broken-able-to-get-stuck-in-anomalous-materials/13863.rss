    <title>Console is Broken / Able to get stuck in Anomalous Materials</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/console-is-broken-able-to-get-stuck-in-anomalous-materials/13863</link>
    <description>[b]First Issue:[/b]

I can not open the console no matter what I do. Changing it in the key bindings does nothing.

I also tried the advice [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/27922-Console-not-opening/?postID=607183#post607183â&#39;]listed here[/url], but it only toggles on/off once before being broken again. It also won&#39;t let me bind to ~ (tilde) since hitting that key wipes whatever is in the console text field.

Edit: Apparently my game now set it to F8 which seems to work... for now. Still really bizarre.

[b]Second Issue:[/b]

In Anomalous Materials, in the room across the hall from where the g-man is having a little chat with a scientist [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/omJQ54H.jpgâ&#39;]you can hop up on to this TV in the corner[/url] and get stuck behind it.

Wasn&#39;t too big of an issue until I realized the console was broken and I couldn&#39;t noclip out, lol. Anyway, just thought you might want to idiot-proof that. Cheers</description>

            <p>Also you can get stuck in the AMS by jumping in it. I can try and get a screenshot of exactly what part when I get home.</p>
