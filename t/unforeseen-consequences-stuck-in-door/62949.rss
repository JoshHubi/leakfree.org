    <title>Unforeseen Consequences - Stuck in door</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/unforeseen-consequences-stuck-in-door/62949</link>
    <description>In chapter Unforeseen Consequences (map bm_c1a1a at 2475x 2289y -59z), the area just after the control room and just beyond the door in question, the passage curves to the right and you encounter a flaming zombie crawling on the floor. This door closed on me while I was on the threshold and I cannot move. It seems to be clipped through my character, and no movement keys will dislodge me. Had to use noclip to get free. 

I tried to reproduce the issue and the second (and third) time, the door closed on me again but did not clip through me. However, I am still stuck and need noclip to get out.</description>
