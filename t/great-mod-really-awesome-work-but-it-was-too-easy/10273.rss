    <description>I see some other people here say how hard it was for them, I don&#39;t see how.

I don&#39;t think I dropped more than 40 health in a firefight on hard mode throughout the entire game unless I fell and dropped to it. HL1 was much much more harder even on medium/normal setting. Could you guys make an even more difficult mode for long time HL1 enthusiasts?</description>

<p>To be fair, my rig isn’t the greatest and as soon as the controllers started teleporting in, my framerate dropped to like 7fps. I hadn’t had any framerate drops up to that point, and it was sad because the set-piece looked so damn cool.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yep, the same thing happened to me too (and I actually have a pretty good rig here). I guess it was all the dynamic lighting from the xen teleporter and the controller’s attacks.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They were going to implement this too in Black Mesa (the controllers would rip apart the pod that the scientist is in), but they sadly cut that feature.</p>

            <p>Seeing people say the ambush in QE is impossible on hard makes me sad.<br>
I think I killed 3 marines with the crossbow while they were rappelling down, 2 grenades for the 4 coming in from the right door, got 1 and hurt the rest, then TAU cannon for clean-up.<br>
Only took me 4 tries, I died to the ones on the roof because I didn’t notice them while running around.</p>
<p>Seriously, casuals choosing “hard” then getting upset because they can’t take the heat isn’t a reason to nerf the difficulty.</p>
<p>Some aliens however seem disproportionately weak even on hard, especially compared to HL1:<br>
-I like the fact that now Houndeyes can be a threat if they catch you with your pants down.<br>
Great change here.</p>
<p>-The new Bullsquid spit is great, but their health nerf makes them too quick to dispatch.<br>
In HL1 you needed 2 grenades/3 magnum/4 shotgun hits to kill one.<br>
In BMS you need 1 grenade/2 magnum/2 shotgun hits, even on hard.<br>
This makes the improved spit a non-issue since you don’t need to dodge more than 1 salvo before you kill it.</p>
<p>-The Vortigaunt charges and fires much faster but the damage nerf makes them dangerous only in 3+ groups. Even then, they’re kinds squishy.<br>
They seem work better as lower damage with a spammy attack, just add more of them on hard.</p>
<p>-The Ichthyosaur is incredibly weak compared to HL1, I mean 2 crossbow hits?!<br>
Should be 4 at a min, especially since you rarely encounter him. (just make sure to put some crossbow ammo around such encounters, like near the dam)</p>
<p>-Alien Grunts seem ok as they are, they didn’t feel nerfed.</p>
<p>I’ll probably edit a skill.cgf on my next run.</p>

<p>Actually OBE recently revealed the secret to beating that room in a ridiculously easy way during his dev speedrun/semicommentary. The more enemies you kill, the more enemies spawn, which means the battle gets harder and harder the longer you keep killing.</p>
<p>So if you just hop around and never kill those first two Controllers, you’ll never have to deal with any other enemies except the two AGrunts at the end when the portal opens.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Come on you guys, Im not even a regular gamer, but I had to get this one because I played the original HL alot back in 1998  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  Its not harder than it needs to be! When something is almost impossible sometimes, its all the more rewarding, when you´re past that moment and is all like “I cant belive” I made that! Thats a feeling I miss all the new fps games… there´s no “shit shit shit” moments! But this game pulled it off  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I will say that i think easy is a bit too easy and normal a little too hard for the category. Still a blast to play though.</p>

<p>Ok, the devs add an Insane mode.</p>
<p>All enemies and allies are now replaced by HECU grunts. All tanks are accompanied by Apaches now. HECU aim is improved by godly capabilities, giving them the ability to snipe you across anywhere in the game with their MP5s.</p>
<p>And you can only use your crowbar. Have fun.</p>

            <p>I can also confirm, that even if the game is overall quite easy with aliens as enemies, HECU kicked my ass a lot, and the QE ambush was HARD.</p>
<p>I also found the Blast Pit (my personal favourite chapter in the original game) to be harder than original (and i’ve beaten hl1 around twenty times)</p>
<p>What I didn’t like was that the game was often cutting me of the areas, which I already visited. This caused my gameplay (when I like to leave some armory and medkits/chargers as a backup) harder sometimes.</p>
<p>I also feel a need to praise the moment, when there is a whole place filled with wall mines. In original game, it was easy and in BM it is so tight… it feels a lot less comfortable to walk around the place.</p>

            <p>dunno bout normal and easy, bcoz i jumped into hard right away, i had no problem beating the game.<br>
fights are easy if u take tacitcal approach rather then using same weapon for everything.<br>
i can understand for ppl not used to fps it can be harder, but my self having competitive background in quake2/3 cs1.3-1.6 and cs :s  it was easy.<br>
i looked at threads and saw ppl having trouble whit tentacle monster, i cnat imagine how easy it was. just roll a grenade and run, did that in 2nd time(coz i took dmg in first try so i redone it.)</p>
<p>the ambush was easy done in 3rd try, first try i f… up, 2nd try i figured out a strategy, 3rd time done it whit losing 10~ hp.</p>
<p>it can be that ppl not used to this kind of fps mb? i saw alot of ppl complaing about ctrl+jump, like cmon any one that played cs/hf was so used to it that it was second nature, like playing cs 1.6 u would bind ctrl on your mouse wheel and do a mini crouch spaming so it would be harder to get headshoted, i had no problem killing soldiers, to me they was like low class cs players/hf players.</p>

            <p>On hard I’ve never been able to listen to a single kick ass music sequence. The helicopter bit on the dam is especially annoying. Unless you’ve played hl1 and know that you have to jump off there’s literally no way you’ll ever clear it on hard difficulty. Especially since the copter shoots you under water with 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>I honestly don’t understand why everyone is saying BMS was hard, sure, there were a few tricky bits, but nothing worse that didn’t take me an extra try or two. I did think it was easier then hl1, seeing how many of the tricky/challenging/annoying parts were removed or made easier. I played on hard, if you were wondering.</p>
<p>How did you guys play the game? I just used the glock and shotgun the entire  game, (besides set pieces like in Questionable Ethics) and never ran out of ammo for either of them, or any of my guns for that matter, besides once or twice. I actually never needed to fire the mp5’s grenades. Not to mention, how much lower the hp for the enemies are overall.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason I ask is because I’m wondering if this has something to do with why people find the game hard, because there not used to this sort of shooter. Maybe I just played hl1 too much, don’t get me started on people who can’t crouch jump lol.</p>
<p>As long as you use the crossbow/.357 while constantly bhoping with the jump pack, they can’t really touch you. I was actually really disappointed with it, as the game just ends after a relatively easy battle.</p>

<p>Actually OBE recently revealed the secret to beating that room in a ridiculously easy way during his dev speedrun/semicommentary. The more enemies you kill, the more enemies spawn, which means the battle gets harder and harder the longer you keep killing.</p>
<p>So if you just hop around and never kill those first two Controllers, you’ll never have to deal with any other enemies except the two AGrunts at the end when the portal opens.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>To be fair, my rig isn’t the greatest and as soon as the controllers started teleporting in, my framerate dropped to like 7fps. I hadn’t had any framerate drops up to that point, and it was sad because the set-piece looked so damn cool.</p>

            <p>Playing on normal, I found it just right. Pretty hard for me but that just made me act more cutious and see enemies more as puzzles that I had to outwit/find the right tactic for rather than pure run and gun. The last battle was pretty hard. Sure, it got easier when moving a lot but still, you needed a lot a spatial awareness to avoid Houndeyes and the drops.<br>
As for the marine ambush in QE, I must have been really lucky there because I went in with the glock, didn’t use another weapon and finished it on the first try without loosing too much health/armor t all. It’s quite satisfying if the timing for reloads works out, such that you can avoid soldiers before moving back in fir the kill.<br>
All in all, I had heaps of fun with this difficulty level. To me it felt ust right.</p>

            <p>I honestly don’t understand why everyone is saying BMS was hard, sure, there were a few tricky bits, but nothing worse that didn’t take me an extra try or two. I did think it was easier then hl1, seeing how many of the tricky/challenging/annoying parts were removed or made easier. I played on hard, if you were wondering.</p>
<p>How did you guys play the game? I just used the glock and shotgun the entire  game, (besides set pieces like in Questionable Ethics) and never ran out of ammo for either of them, or any of my guns for that matter, besides once or twice. I actually never needed to fire the mp5’s grenades. Not to mention, how much lower the hp for the enemies are overall.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason I ask is because I’m wondering if this has something to do with why people find the game hard, because there not used to this sort of shooter. Maybe I just played hl1 too much, don’t get me started on people who can’t crouch jump lol.</p>

            <p>It’s definitely harder than HL1/HL2, especially the HEC. Strategies are different too, no more run-and-strafe with the MP5, but rather wait in ambush with the shotgun or revolver.</p>
