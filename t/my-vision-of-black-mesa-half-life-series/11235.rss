    <description>Call this nitpicking if you will, and [b]it&#39;s not a complaint just an observation.[/b]
I know this is meant to play &quot;[b]old school[/b]&quot; and it&#39;s not [b]Half-Life style[/b] and the devs aren&#39;t an [b]AAA studio...
[/b]

And no worries, I keep in mind that this &quot;just a mod&quot; and not a retail game, but maybe some more:

-physics
-particle and lighting effects (the flickering at the start of Questionable Ethics is just nice)
-scripted sequences (like &quot;Who is this guy, Freeman?&quot; HECU convo)
-cutscenes (in a style of HL2 intro or even just add the &quot;prepare for unforeseen consequences&quot; scene from the trailer into the mod as Gordon wakes up after Resonance Cascade to give it some sense of mystery and creepiness)

It would make it feel more &quot;professional&quot; rather than &quot;fanmade&quot;

            <p>Black Mesa compliments Half-Life 2, the “cult” of Freeman makes more sense now that I’ve revisited and seen all the people Freeman kept alive, maybe they escaped too and began spreading word.</p>
<p>And for the original post:<br>
It does not need anything more “fancy” There are already other scripted sequences if we’re talking about the type of “who is this guy, Freeman” You don’t have to listen to them you can pop them there and then. Like “Freeman I have a message for you” Or in the test chamber, or in lambda complex! No more is required.</p>
<p>And no, we don’t need that one bit of creepy to make things more interesting.</p>
<p>I’ll join the choir, we don’t need cinematic cutscenes for Half-Life.<br>
The HL2 beginning and ending are the same way they were in the ending of Half-Life. Ripping the player of control is fine when the player has no control.</p>
<p>This is already on par with valve professionalism if not even of better quality. Yes one cutscene and one camera drive would break the game. This is a very good remaster of the original.<br>
No need for Half-Life Solid 3.<br>
I’d rather let the series die than please the brainless. Let Black Mesa team do Half-Life 3 rather than have it be full modern gen nancy-pansying.</p>

            <p>Dotard missed Quicktime events. That would make the game so awesome and modern.</p>
<p>Look, you could implement that instead of puzzles or tough encounters.</p>
<p>Even btter: Combine that with cutscenes, like this:</p>
<p>First you get a cutscene shows you the helicotper with a camera overview and flyby. Next you get some text on the screen “Press Jump repeatedly to defeat the Helicopter” (Then you get a totally cool 3rd person animation how Gordon defeats the helicopter).</p>
<p>And if you have lost health you can hide behind those crates so it regenerates.</p>
<p>Yes, that would bve awesome and totally innovative that even “Dotard the Inventor” would be pleased.</p>

            <p>As others have said, I love that the only time Half-Life has ever had “cut-scenes” is when Gordon literally cannot control himself (so even then they aren’t really cut-scenes since you cannot control just as Gordon cannot move).  And even in most of these scenes you can still even look around.</p>
<p>Since the G-Man is observing Gordon and has not yet decided if he wants to offer him “employment” until the very end, there’s no reason for Gordon to have a scripted vision of him like in Episode Two.</p>

<p>This is why I prefer HL1 over HL2: 90% of AAA games are junk, because the triple A is given from reviewers that have to give a triple A to mantain their jobs (and I don’t mean that they get paid by the companies, rather than people rage at them -see ValveTime review of BMS- when they say something which goes against the common opinion, which lately is generated from a large amount of casual gamers who think to be hardcore gamers… and here we might start a topic about what makes a casual gamer or a hardcore gamer, let’s don’t do it and try to take it as it is. And I’m not saying that HL2 is awful.)</p>

<p>No, they won’t do it; but they would break the immersion.<br>
Also you wrote “depressing” and I dare to say that I guess to understand what you mean with it, and it’s not like that. I know the game might be heavy in some parts but THAT is the immersion, you’re so taken that you want a break, but you don’t want to stop playing because you want to see what is going to happen. THIS is the success of Half Life, what made it great, and what makes Valve’s game great games on average.</p>

<p>This is what I didn’t like of HL2, which made me nausea in HL2:EP1, bittered me with HL2:EP2 and therefore made myself disinterested in EP3 or a hypothetical HL3. Too much Gordon do this Gordon do that Gordon clap your hands and myself “Alyx… Shh!”.</p>

            <p>Just would like to pop in and say that Half-Life has puzzles and is not a CoD clone. It was a conscious decision to cut out cutscenes in all the Half-Life games for a good reason. And the puzzles and exploration sections break up the game nicely between the heavy action sequences.</p>
<p>Half-Life doesn’t need to “stay relevant”. I hate that term. I don’t give a flying flip about what’s “relevant”. Games today suck. I wouldn’t mind if Valve took the best out of what there is now (not much) and implements it into HL3 or EP3 or whatever they’re going to make, but what I do expect them to do is innovate and adapt with THEIR OWN ideas. That’s what made Half-Life great in the first place. They did something that wasn’t done before. They don’t need to copy from other games. They’re perfectly capable and much more suited to making their own innovations. You do know what the word “innovate” means right? It means breaking new ground. They’re not “innovating” by copying other games to make it “relevant”. When HL2 came out, all the other FPS’s were going with the standard 2-weapon limit (you might say, this was a “relevant innovation” or “adaption”). Meanwhile, HL2 and its episodes continued to offer a full arsenal at the player’s disposal and it did pretty darn well despite this. Imagine that.</p>
<p>Screw relevance.</p>

            <p>Or the area where you come upon the citadel in the distance of the destroyed city, where all the wires and destruction is placed in a way to direct the player’s attention to the fact that the Citadel is still standing, and towers over the destruction of City 17 - but the player can choose to completely ignore it if he wants. Having a cutscene that directs the player’s attention to the citadel hurts the subtle narrative in moments like that because it’s no longer subtle.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>@ Dotard: If cutscenes in HL are your thing, you might like the mod I’m working on. There will be at least a few, mostly to ease the transition between maps in a manner similar to map transitions in “Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.” I always found suddenly being ambushed by a LOADING marker to be somewhat jarring as it is, and considering the maps will be designed to be back-trackable and multiple-use areas that keep track of variables between maps as in a Metroidvania, cutscene content is slightly more appropriate. However, using point_viewcontrol cutscenes can sometimes bug the interface, and interrupting the maps mid-mission to show off scripted events is unlikely as it breaks flow. (For cutscenes, I’ll put the player’s actual model in a darkbox outside the map with a button around them to press, and a HUD hint to hit “USE” to skip)</p>
<p>The only reason I’d use camera cuts is to direct the player if I have a complex puzzle, as in the original Metroid Prime. But again, it’s unlikely I’ll do much in the way of cutscene content aside from level transitions and possibly the beginning and end of the mod as visual rewards. A lot of people hate cutscenes with a passion- they take away control from the player to show something. I happen to like them in some cases, as in the aforementioned “Metal Gear” series because they have very tight camerawork and excellent actor blocking, and a good sense of style that is appropriate to the series. But over-use of cutscenes (as in MGS4) can just get annoying. MGS4’s last three acts are heavily out-balanced in the cutscene to gameplay ratio, as well as major changes to the first two acts’ gameplay ideas making things more annoying(sneaking through warzones in Act 1 and 2, Act 3 is following people and a remake of the MGS3 motorcycle chase, Act 4 is a nostalgia level against robots, Act 5 everyone knows you’re there already so the whole map is hunting you).</p>
<p>In Half Life 2 and their episodes, the visual rewards of cutscenes are retained, but in “Vistas” - areas of major scenery porn for the player to take in while retaining full control. Story sequences are also blocked out for NPCs with scripts. If the player wants to look someplace else or throw things around the room rather then watch the story content, they can, and that’s why HL is refreshingly different than most shooters and so highly regarded among gamers.</p>
<p>Either way, as far as vanilla HL2 goes, it’s always been about a fluid, continuous journey, and interrupting gameplay to show off scripted events breaks flow. Think about HL2 Episode One- in the commentary, one of the level designers specifically made an area of buildings to frame soldiers rappelling down in front of the player. It’s a lot more impressive than cutting to them with a seperate cut-scene.</p>

</aside>
<p>Again, I am curious as to whether or not you actually remember anything about the half-life series, because every single game in the franchise has had puzzles, simple and confusing. The puzzles ramp up in dificulty as you progress, the same way new enemies are introduced and battles become more challenging as you progress.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Half-Life games are so well regarded is that they let the player figure out things on his/her own, a cutscene to help you out would do the exact opposite.</p>
<p>It’s the same reason Valve didn’t want to have human characters you travel with just drop obvious hints to make those puzzles easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VofXcw8AJQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This old thing</a> is a pretty good explanation as to why it works so well, and if you forgot about it (or haven’t watched it) will maybe remind you why Valve does the complete opposite of what you are suggesting, and why those changes wouldn’t be added to BM.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t even get what this means. It almost sounds like you want them to replace environmental puzzles with confusing level design?</p>

            <p>I went into playing Black Mesa expecting nothing but the best.</p>
<p>What did I get? Better than that.</p>
<p>The modification as a whole is an experience that shatters most AAA game titles that I’ve played. I’m not switching characters between ‘missions’ as I try to ‘kill the bad guys’, I’m not sitting back and watching the cutscenes roll by so that I can understand how the story is supposed to progress. I AM the player, progressing through a CONSTANTLY unfolding plot, I am ALWAYS immersed with the game, which is more then I can say about the Call of Battlefield: Honorfare series.</p>
<p>I do not believe there is anything flawed about the game, DoTard, [COLOR=‘Red’]&lt;edit - no insults please&gt;</p>

</aside>
<p>You want to add this scripted dialog to have a puzzle solved for you. Your problem with that puzzle isn’t a dev-side issue, it’s a player-side issue. BTW, that puzzle, with the garg, has the same solution as in HL, so you shouldn’t have had a problem.</p>
<p>The other 2 ideas break immersion and aren’t necessary anyway.</p>

            <p>According to the justification of others, proceed with your own judgement.<br>
If you think this thread still has a purpose and it’s not against the rules, then keep it.</p>
<p>It’s not like I have more to say when mostly it’s just a one big “NO”<br>
There has been some dramatization over my post IMO, please do not doubt my Half-Life fandom.<br>
I know what makes the series special, that’s why I’m waiting a day after day for a sequel.</p>
<p>I don’t want the gameplay or immersion dumbed-down, just more user-friendly and less depressing… it’s possible.<br>
Again, reconsider it… would a short G-man cutscene or some more HECU scripted dialogue or a single camera-scene angle destroy the game?</p>
