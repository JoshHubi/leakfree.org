            <p>It is a programming error, having powerful or low end computer makes no difference for it.<br>
Problem is (simplified) that the part of the map the engine has to process at the given moment should fit into some buffer having pre-defined set of entries. If due to some set of events you happen to get in a situatuon when there are move entries to process to form the frame - you get a buffer overflow and game over. These entries are “vertex” and theya are what all the world geometry is constructed of. Lowering models detail level helps to lower the vertex count the game have to process each frame thus making it less probable to hit the buffer overflow.</p>

            <p>Try lowering the models detail level to medium or low. It is known bug with the maps being able to push Source enging up to the limits that are by default set in Source SDK. It would hopefully be fixed in a future patches, most probably at the moment BM would get released on Steam.</p>
