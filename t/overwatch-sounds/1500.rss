    <description>Would be great to hear some hefty overwatch sounds equivalent to HL2 in this game.  

Here&#39;s a link to HL2 city voice,

<p>The old announcement system was a great way of portraying the status of the facility. First you have the announcements for science personnel, then the security and medical emergency response calls, then the military take control and later on it goes quiet.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Attention. This announcement system now under military command.</span></p>
<p>First time I heard that, I crapped myself.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You have really hit the nail on the head when you say portraying the status of the facility. There is something about the old VOX system that makes black mesa seem almost alien in itself. I would often get chills when the HL1 VOX spoke in that monotone and unclear voice.<br>
Valve didn’t quite get that same feeling in HL2, with Overwatch. I never really felt disconnected enough from Overwatch. It felt too human. I think with the HL1 VOX the fact that you can feel completely disconnected from it and feel like its not talking personally to you, gave the game a great sense of loneliness, which on occasions got a bit much.</p>
<p>But I really hope they can get the balance between the clarity of Overwatch and the alienation feel of HL1 VOX</p>

            <p>No, he was right, that sentence as written doesn’t actually mean what you’re all trying to interpret it to mean. You’d need some unwieldy sentence like “More and more science personnel will be terminated until you surrender or they are all dead.”</p>
<p>That said, the grunts in HL were infamous for their lack of good communication skills: “Yore dead Freemen” anyone?</p>

<p>WRONG!</p>
<p>“All science personnel will be terminated until you surrender.”</p>
<p>Basically “We will continue to terminate science team personnel until you surrender. When you do surrender, we will stop terminating science team personnel.”</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve played Half-Life, so I can’t remember if it’s actually silent at all. I just based that off what UrBY said. Regardless of whether or not it <span class="bbcode-i">does</span> go silent, I still think that the silence makes sense. The military took over control of the voice announcement system, but by the ‘Forget about Freeman’ chapter, they definitely seemed to have lost control of the situation and that would include the announcement system. It would be a very powerful feeling to have the announcers go silent as a way of signifying that no one is there, and reinforce the notion that the last hope of humanity has abandoned the facility.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It doesn’t, it’s just automatic warning messages about the sector, not facility-wide announcements made by the HECU.</p>

<p>I think he was trying to say that later on in the game, when the military has control of the system, that there is only static and NO announcements.  To be honest, I think it would be annoying depending on how loud that static is.  Would it only turn on periodically and then off? I think the HECU radios did something like that at times.  There would be like 2-3 seconds of static and then nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The statuc wouldn’t have to be loud. As long as you can make the player notice the speakers that the voice is announced from at the beginning of the game, by the end of the game they should be able to notice the speakers as well as noticing that the quiet static coming from it signifies that the military has abandoned the base.</p>

<p>I don’t think it should be made silent towards the end though, since it is a computerised system. Since the military took it over instead of destroying it I see no reason as to why it should stop its automatic messages in the Lambda Core.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve played Half-Life, so I can’t remember if it’s actually silent at all. I just based that off what UrBY said. Regardless of whether or not it <span class="bbcode-i">does</span> go silent, I still think that the silence makes sense. The military took over control of the voice announcement system, but by the ‘Forget about Freeman’ chapter, they definitely seemed to have lost control of the situation and that would include the announcement system. It would be a very powerful feeling to have the announcers go silent as a way of signifying that no one is there, and reinforce the notion that the last hope of humanity has abandoned the facility.</p>

<p>That’s because the Overwatch Voice was broadcast from the Citadel.</p>

</aside>
<p>How would you know that? Aside from being a very flawed idea announcing everything from the citadel (sound can get lost and distorted very easily for one), it would be a lot of hassle. I always thought they sounded as though they were coming from speakers dotted around the city like the Breencasts. I always got the feeling that they were about 30 meters away.</p>

            <p>It was already very clear, but it could be louder. Overwatch 2.0 was a lot louder in Episode 2 but still wasn’t very clear.</p>

            <p>The announcement system from HL1 was one of my favorite parts of the game.  It just added that much more realism to the facility.</p>
<p>I even have BM announcements set as windows sounds for when my OS starts up and shuts down.</p>
