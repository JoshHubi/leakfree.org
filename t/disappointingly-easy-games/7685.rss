            <p>Nah, Far Cry was just ungodly difficult. Even on normal, that last level required at least 50 tries before I beat it. Fucking goddamn apes and their rocket launchers and perfect accuracy.</p>

            <p>Poe’s law is a bitch.</p>
<p>I’ve definitely seen dingleberries on messageboards claim that Far Cry was easy, and everyone who didn’t beat it first try on the hardest difficulty without dying is just a n00b.</p>

<p>You, sir, are high. Checkpoints + just a few shots and you’re dead + omniscient AI that can see through tents and shoot you in the head = difficult game. In fact, Far Cry was hands down the hardest SP FPS I’ve ever played. And I’ve played most of them.</p>

            <p>I agree on <span class="bbcode-i">Star Wars: the Force Unleashed II</span>, I couldn’t be bothered with “challenge mode” once I finished the SP portion.</p>
<p>Finished the game (all powers unlocked, all pickups) on the highest difficulty within 5 hours. Only the big gargantuan boss was annoying as hell. The rest was a breeze.</p>
<p>Also, the game was even less interactive with the environment than the first one was, big bummer imo.</p>
<p>Other easy games:<br>
Limbo - but you play that one for the style and atmosphere anyway.<br>
From Dust - but the replayability on that one is very high.<br>
Deus Ex 2 - Saddest port/sequel ever.<br>
Halo 3 - Finished the fight in one go, Legendary isn’t as brutal as Halo 2.</p>
<p>Loads of others, but these I can remember more easily.</p>

<p>I thought Red Faction: Guerilla was a disappointment all around. It felt like they were too focused on the destruction engine to make the other components of the game as good as they could have been. It felt like GTA: Mars Edition with a destructible landscape.</p>

            <p>I would have to say FEAR 2. But that was disappointing ALL around. Or maybe Star Wars: Republic Commando.</p>
<p>Course now that I really think about it, I know a lot of games that are to easy.</p>
<p>Star Wars: Jedi Knight 2 Jedi Outcast<br>
Deus Ex 2<br>
Portal<br>
Portal 2<br>
Half Life: Lost Coast<br>
TimeShift<br>
Hitman: Blood Money (fun though)<br>
Doom 3 (also fun, but gets kinda old. Way easy.)</p>
<p>That’s all I can think of for now.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">Doom 3:</span> I think it may have been that way because I rampaged through it in coop with a buddy of mine. Still fun though.</p>
