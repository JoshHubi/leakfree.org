    <title>Killing Floor Font Problems</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/killing-floor-font-problems/5891</link>
    <description>I noticed when I recently booted up Killing Floor that there is a problem with the font ingame, everything has become little dots and unreadable, unlike the normal text that is found usually.  

Is there a way to remedy this?  I don&#39;t know exactly how to solve it.  When I change the resolution, it turns back, but some things still have dots on them.

Nevermind, I corrected it myself after looking at Tripwire Interactive&#39;s forum.  Sorry.</description>
