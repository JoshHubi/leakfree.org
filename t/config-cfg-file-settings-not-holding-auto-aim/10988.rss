    <title>config.cfg file settings not holding (auto aim)</title>

    <description>Hi all
Not sure if this is intentional or a bug, so here goes.

When in game I am trying to get the autoaim option switched off via options-&gt; black mesa tab, but it&#39;s not holding the setting between mod restarts.

When I un-tick auto aim &amp; click on apply, the console shows the file has been written to as it shows as Host_WriteConfiguration: Wrote cfg/config.cfg

Now when I quit out of the mod &amp; re-load it &amp; check the setting its back to its default of ON...

[u]have tried[/u]
Manually editing the config.cfg file in sourcemods\bms\cfg
&amp; setting the sk_autoaim_mode &quot;1&quot; 
to 
sk_autoaim_mode &quot;0&quot;
now set the file to read only, (I&#39;m guessing the above option is for auto aim)

On game launch the option is back to ON, needless to say if I try to change it in game in won&#39;t work due to file been set a read only.

[u]Have tried[/u]
deleting the config.cfg file from sourcemods\bms\cfg
When mod is launched the config.cfg file gets re-created &amp; can be amended in game.  However the option still does not hold.


I have tried changing some of the other option with the black mesa tab such as Iron sight / Iron sight sticky / always run &amp; these settings as selected [u]do[/u] hold 

Am currently using a re-generated config.cfg file with black mesa tab options left on there defaults

Any thoughts?</description>
