    <title>Weird weapon menu navigation</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weird-weapon-menu-navigation/11311</link>
    <description>Did anyone else find the weapon selection kind of bothersome? I really hate how it sort of saves your place in the weapon menu. I&#39;m so used to pressing 3 once for the SMG, twice for the shotgun, and three times for the crossbow. Same sort of thing for the other weapon slots.

But now I can&#39;t do that, because if I&#39;m using, say, the shotgun, and I want to switch to my SMG, I have to press 3 twice to get past the crossbow, then get to the SMG. It&#39;s kind of a huge pain having to remember exactly what position I am in the weapon menu to know how many times I have to press the weapon slot number in order to use the weapon I want. Especially in the heat of battle.

Has this bothered anyone else?</description>

<p>You’re reducing the argument down so that all of its points are lost.</p>
<p>You’re also exaggerating the conclusion (insanity) so the argument appears more ridiculous than it is. I never said it was insanity.</p>
<p>It’s an unnecessary change which makes life more difficult. I find it difficult to pick the right weapons in the heat of a battle now, where my focus should be on the combat - not fighting a more complicated weapon selection system.</p>
<p>Like I said, it’s about muscle memory. Remembering 3, 3, click for Shotgun is much easier because it’s consistent. It’s always 3, 3, click. It’s muscle memory. You don’t even need to think about it. How can you not understand that it is markedly more simple and requires far less conscious thought than when the Shotgun is sometimes 1 or sometimes 2 keypresses? That requires conscious thought. It wastes time. It distracts you from the fight momentarily.</p>
<p>No, it’s not insanity. Don’t put words in my mouth to make my argument seem more ridiculous. But it is unnecessary and easily resolvable.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, it is worse. And do you know why it’s worse? It requires conscious thought. No matter how good you are at memorizing this sort of thing, it requires far more conscious thought than the old system. You have to recall what position the gun you want is relative to the gun you’re carrying, and how many keypresses are needed from that position relative. That’s 3 things to keep track of, which all change with each different weapon. This conscious thinking process, which can’t really be avoided given the nature of the weapon selection, shaves what - half a second to a second off your reaction times when you need to switch a weapon? In the heat of a battle, that’s the difference between life and a few deaths. The old system allowed you to use muscle and long term memory without even really thinking about it. It was better.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: In the heat of a battle, you’ve finished spraying down someone with your MP5 and an enemy suddenly jumps up in your face. You want to pull out a Shotgun because you’re a skilled player and want the right tools for the job.</p>
<p>Old System: 3, 3, Click, Bang. Every time I want the Shotgun, no matter what. 3, 3, Click, Bang. Can do it anytime, wherever.</p>
<p>New System: Just half a second -&gt; a second’s thought or so - I have the MP5 on (which is…1st on the list), and I want the Shotgun (which is…2nd on the list), so I want to press the button once. Okay.</p>
<p>See the difference in this somewhat biased example? Now you want to switch back to the MP5.</p>
<p>Old System: 3, Click, Bang.</p>
<p>New System: I’m on the Shotgun, which is 2nd down the list…so I have to press the button…twice.</p>
<p>It seems minute, but it really is unnecessary and just adds more conscious elements to something which should really be purely reactionary.</p>
<p>EDIT: I know it seems petty, but I really think the simplest solution would be to have it an option in the options menu. A toggle between old style, and new style weapon switching. Then everyone would be happy. Why would you all oppose that so violently?</p>

<p>No, I actually have a problem with it, along with most people, not solely because it’s different, but because it’s confusing and is less functional than the previous inventory system. If you’re fine with it, great, but a lot of others aren’t, for valid reasons. I don’t know where you get off with accusing me of being unable to adjust, but if this is all you can do, then I rest my case.</p>

            <p>I don’t know about the coding aspect, but a simple checkbox (On / Off) for something like ‘<span class="bbcode-i">Enable OLD Weapon Menu Navigation</span>’, could potentially satisfy more than one side.</p>
<p>If you want to use it, check it - if you don’t, uncheck it.</p>

            <p>then gtfo dude, we get that you don’t agree</p>
<p>i’d like the HL series to play and feel consistent, currently that’s not <span class="bbcode-i">entirely</span> the case</p>
<p>yes, this is small stuff, but is it really that much of a crime to point out small stuff?</p>

            <p>I guess I’m strange then since I have memorized the location of every weapon in the menu.<br>
On the other hand though, I’ve always stumbled through the default HL2 menu, switching to the wrong weapon all the time. This made me prioritize two weapons and always used ‘Q’ to switch between them. The menu in BM is so much better.</p>

<p>You’re forgetting that, since most weapon switches are in battle, the player isn’t going to think “ok, I have shotgun, crossbow and mp5 are next”, since that will take them away from the battle and leave them vulnerable, since their mind is somewhere else. With the older way, its easy to remember, it’s just 3 one for mp5, twice for shotgun, etc, it requires much less thinking on the player’s part, and with most people, I’m sure that they often switched weapons using the older way without even realizing it, it’s like a subconscious thing, as again, there’s much less thought involved. With the new way, you have to think about what position you’re in on the inventory screen, which takes you away from battle and wastes precious seconds.</p>

            <p>Not derailing, but I also miss the auto reload when a weapon isn’t selected, although unrealstic, I think it really speeds up gameplay in the HL2 series, often in Black Mesa I’ll use a weapon almost to dry, then switch to another one to finish off an enemy, and then switch back to the first weapon a few seconds later and think “oh ffs it’s still not reloaded”.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the new weapons switch really throws me off my game, particularly if I’m transitioning from a seperate HL2 mod. I can see what they were trying to do- they were trying to reduce the key presses needed to ready the next weapon down.</p>
<p>That said, two presses of two and a click represents “MAGNUM” in my brain. It comes down to basic muscle memory. Swapping between BM and Minerva: Metastasis can bring this issue into stark focus. They’re both on the same engine, and they’re both very Half-Life in their execution by design. M:M, being based on HL2 and having nothing in the way of interface modifications aside from Minerva’s messages to the player, is entirely consistent with the retail HL2.(2+2+click = MAG) Black Mesa, in it’s attempt to improve on everything in the original HL, inadvertently made itself a stumbling block in a way. (If you have the glock equipped, 2=MAG, 2+2= Glock again) It’s not <em>difficult</em> to adapt to, but it <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> a problem with the interface.</p>
<p>Just saying HURR DURR DEAL WITH IT.JPG is just ignoring the issue. It’s about consistency in terms of the interface. Under stress, the player will likely have to rely on muscle memory to switch weapons mid-fight (like the Questionable Ethics sequence). So getting out the crossbow when I mean to switch to the MP5 costs me precious seconds while I’m getting pelted with bullets, which leads to many a pointless death. Personally, if there was a way to fix this with the next release or bugfix I’d prefer changing it to leaving as-is, just because it’s more consistent with the original HL’s interface.</p>

            <p>I actually did not notice this at all for some reason, I really didn’t have any problems switching weapons in tricky situations.</p>
<p>Though I hadn’t really sat down and played any HL games in a long time before I played Black Mesa.</p>

<p>True, there are ways to get around it. But honestly, if you really need to put effort into “getting around” a feature/change in the game, then it probably shouldn’t be there in the first place IMO.</p>
<p>And really, it’s a completely pointless change. I’ve already mentioned how it messes with your muscle memory and will probably cause many people to screw up and fire the wrong weapon.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, I agree. It didn’t need to happen. It’d be nice if there was an option to have the old style of switching weapons.</p>
<p>It screws with your muscle memory. The good thing about HL1/2 style switching is that you memorize - press 3 twice for the Shotgun, no matter what. In the heat of a fight if I want to pull out the Shotgun I don’t even have to think about it, just press 3 twice. Bam. Sorted. It’s in my mind forever. No matter what I can always pull out the Shotgun.</p>
<p>Current system, well. It doesn’t work well. If I have the MP5, I have to press it once only. And seeing as one of the most common switches between weapons for me was the MP5 and Shotgun, it screwed me royally many times. Then to put the MP5 back on I’d have to press it twice? Sometimes twice, sometimes once? It requires thinking there and then on the spot about how many key presses are needed, which not only takes you out of the moment but wastes a precious second. Maybe it works for some people, I dunno, but I would have been a helluva lot happier if there was an option for the old style of weapon switching. I can’t tell you the number of times mid fight I’d put on the same weapon I’m already carrying because I pressed it one time too few. Not nice, and not really necessary.</p>
<p>Also, Dr. Karamazov, we’re not complaining about it solely because it’s different. That would be stupid. We’re complaining because it is a counter-intuitive, and fairly unnecessary change to something which was never broke in the first place. Change things, by all means, but why change them for the worse? Perhaps some people, such as yourself, like it, that’s fine. I don’t. I’m allowed to not like it, and I’m allowed to moan about it. At least it’s constructive.</p>

<p>You could always just flick your eyes up to the corner and look for 3 quarters of a second. Or press a different slot key first and then click use the proper one. Or hit the slot key and use the mouse wheel. It doesn’t take long to get used to this minor change.</p>
