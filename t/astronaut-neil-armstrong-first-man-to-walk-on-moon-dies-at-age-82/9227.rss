Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, died Saturday, weeks after heart surgery and days after his 82nd birthday.

His family reported the death at 2:45 p.m. ET. A statement said he died following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures. 

Armstrong commanded the Apollo 11 spacecraft that landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, and he radioed back to Earth the historic news: &quot;That&#39;s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.&quot;

He spent nearly three hours walking on the moon with fellow astronaut Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin.

Armstrong and his wife, Carol, married in 1999, made their home in the Cincinnati suburb of Indian Hill, but he had largely stayed out of public view in recent years. His birthday was Aug. 5.

He spoke at Ohio State University during a February event honoring fellow astronaut John Glenn and the 50th anniversary of Glenn becoming the first American to orbit the Earth. In May, Armstrong joined Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon, at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida to support the opening of The National Flight Academy, which aims to teach math and science to kids through an aviation-oriented camp.

The Apollo 11 moon mission turned out to be Armstrong&#39;s last space flight. The following year he was appointed to a desk job, being named NASA&#39;s deputy associate administrator for aeronautics in the office of advanced research and technology.

He left NASA a year later to become a professor of engineering at the University of Cincinnati.

In all, 12 Americans walked on the moon from 1969 to 1972.



Anybody see the landing on TV when it happened in 1969?</description>

            <p>I’m sure you love Russia, but touting the Roscosmos is a losing proposition. It’s an absolute disaster and is considered to be surpassed by the European Space Agency, China, Japan, and India.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/03/12/148247197/for-russias-troubled-space-program-mishaps-mount" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.npr.org/2012/03/12/148247197/for-russias-troubled-space-program-mishaps-mount</a></p>
<p>In the late 50s and early 60s, the Soviets had a superior space program, but that all changed in the late 60s, and essentially, the Soviets lost the “Space Race”.</p>
<p>The focus of the Soviet Space program was always as a military application, an attempt to create a military superiority in space, or rather, in orbit. The program was about space stations and weaponized satellites. Whereas, NASA has always been a civilian organization with a primary focus on exploration, science, and technology. While the Soviets were trying to militarize near space, NASA was exploring the solar system, launching communications satellites for countries who did not yet have a space program, developing and sharing technologies for civilian applications that are now ubiquitous to our lifestyles, and conducting experiments and collecting data that has furthered the understanding of the universe and advanced humanity in ways that most people don’t even realize.</p>
<p>The old Soviet space program was almost exclusively about military applications. Almost all information about the program was a military secret. There was no sharing of data. There was no sharing of technology. There wasn’t a lot in the way of collection of scientific data, and they certainly weren’t going to share any technology for civilian applications. And now the USSR is gone. The Russian space program is an absolute disaster - corrupt, underfunded, superseded by several other space programs, and embarrassed with one failure after another. This is their mission to mars last year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/science/space/russian-official-suggests-weapon-caused-spacecraft-failure.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/science/space/russian-official-suggests-weapon-caused-spacecraft-failure.html</a></p>
<p>The Soviets could have done what NASA has done, if they wanted, but they chose a different course. Now the Soviets are gone and their most important achievement is the cautionary tale that was their existence.</p>
<p>Sure, Yuri Gagarin was the first man in space, but that accomplishment was superseded when Armstrong walked on the moon.</p>

<p>Haha, oops.</p>
<p>A friend and I were wasting time out by a pond one autumnal day (it was actually a culdesac along some bayou, but the presence of some leaves on the calm reflecting water made it feel like a pond). It was there that I made a similar mistake to the one I’ve just committed.</p>
<p>We happened upon that particular hill because we were driving around trying to find a playground he remembered from his early childhood. This stop was a particularly peaceful place abound with trees and shade. He had been to that playground before, at the top of this wooded bank, but the children were kept there-- so he had the urge to poke around where his maturity now permitted. I’m an avid explorer of public spaces, plus he was my ride, so I wandered with.</p>
<p>As we stepped down from a bulwark supporting the playground, the stairs made a short path under the protection of an acorn tree near the water’s edge. The good news is that this path continued, at least a little bit, in the form of a humble dock with one of those recycled-plastic-composite benches. They’re ideal in this salty air, but it’s rare to find one shaded nicely in the evening, so we had a seat and talked about the goings-on in our lives. Inevitably, “yesterday’s SMBC” became a topic of conversation-- it’s one of the few webcomics regularly surveilled by us both.</p>
<p>The moment’s SMBC mentioned something about celebrity caveman Zorg and his ability to forage edible roots, but as striven as I was to remember this tale clearly, I remembered his name as “Groz” instead. My comrade realized the beauty of this mistake, that it was sincere and perfectly backwards.</p>
<p>I remember that mistake…<br>
I remember most mistakes.</p>

            <p>If anyone doesn’t already know - here’s what he’s referring to:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories</a></p>
<p>The whole thing was started by one book written by a professional conspiracy theorist and latched onto by The Flat Earth Society (for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>It was never really very popular and had almost completely died when FOX News ran a special in 2001 called “Did We Land on the Moon?” which started the thing all over again, and it became much more popular than it ever was before, probably due to the internet.</p>
<p>Here’s a NASA article regarding the FOX News program:</p>
<p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast23feb_2/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast23feb_2/</a></p>
<p>Neil Armstrong was a true hero, a word I really hate because it’s so overused in the US as to be worthless when needed to describe someone like Armstrong. He was the first human not only to step on the Moon, but on any non-terrestrial body.</p>
<p>American astronauts of that period, especially on this particular mission, had giant balls to sit on top of the more than 6 million pounds of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen that fueled the Saturn V rocket, which would propel them to 17,500 MPH in less than 3 minutes, on a exploration that no human had ever attempted or thought possible prior to that generation, out of this world and to a completely different body and back. In history, there were no greater explorers and no greater scientific and technological undertaking.</p>

            <p>It’s almost horrifying to see sound minded people be culled by the lies mass media feed them.  Anyone who believes we sent anything besides a few hunks of metal into space isn’t using common sense.  Sad, really.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Armstrong, he was a conspirator in one of the greatest fraud’s in American history.  He was a manipulative liar.  [COLOR=‘Black’][/required trolling]</p>

            <p>May he Rest In Peace!</p>
<p>In the moon program, many people from different countries worked together. With their effort, and achievements a new era had began. He had the honor to step onto the surface of the Moon first. I hope people will learn from him and his people, and from teaching of that era.</p>
<p>We’re made to do magnificent things. I hope I’ll live to see the landing on Mars, I hope to see the day when mankind realises that our destiny is to reach out further and further, to conquer the stars… but as a united species, living in peace with each other.<br>

<p>By NBC News<br>
8/25/2012</p>
<p>Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, died Saturday, weeks after heart surgery and days after his 82nd birthday.</p>
<p>His family reported the death at 2:45 p.m. ET. A statement said he died following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures.</p>
<p>Armstrong commanded the Apollo 11 spacecraft that landed on the moon on July 20, 1969, and he radioed back to Earth the historic news: “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.”</p>
<p>He spent nearly three hours walking on the moon with fellow astronaut Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin.</p>
<p>Armstrong and his wife, Carol, married in 1999, made their home in the Cincinnati suburb of Indian Hill, but he had largely stayed out of public view in recent years. His birthday was Aug. 5.</p>
<p>He spoke at Ohio State University during a February event honoring fellow astronaut John Glenn and the 50th anniversary of Glenn becoming the first American to orbit the Earth. In May, Armstrong joined Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon, at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida to support the opening of The National Flight Academy, which aims to teach math and science to kids through an aviation-oriented camp.</p>
<p>The Apollo 11 moon mission turned out to be Armstrong’s last space flight. The following year he was appointed to a desk job, being named NASA’s deputy associate administrator for aeronautics in the office of advanced research and technology.</p>
<p>He left NASA a year later to become a professor of engineering at the University of Cincinnati.</p>
<p>In all, 12 Americans walked on the moon from 1969 to 1972.</p>
<p>Anybody see the landing on TV when it happened in 1969?</p>
