    <title>NVIDIA 306.97 driver problems with BM</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/nvidia-306-97-driver-problems-with-bm/11548</link>
    <description>Loaded latest NVIDIA display driver for my 6200 series card and found a bug.  Instead of getting a shadow below each of the characters, you get a dark rectangle that moves along the ground with the character.  Reverted to the previous NVIDIA 301.42 driver and it displays characters shadows correctly.  Not sure if this has been reported before.  Running Windows 7 Ultimate.

BTW, this is the first official NVIDIA driver released for Win8/Win7/Vista (and it has the additional name of international?).  Just sayin&#39;.  Carry on.</description>

            <p>ever since the Orange Box update there are many more bugs in Source games on older cards like the Geforce 6200 and even 7300… the ATI cards from that time period are perfectly capable of running BM but there are no windows 7 drivers to be found, luckily the Vista driver works if modded properly</p>

            <p>Its a problem with the graphic drivers for nvidia cards, rolling back to older drivers got rid of that problem for me. Anything in the 296.xx range and lower got rid of that and fixed the flashlight issue. Seems like all the geforce drivers have this problem not sure why could be nvidia messed something up in the newer ones.</p>
