<p>True but it isn’t really stupid in hard mode is it? if a hunter in easy mode is a bit difficult to kill (not much for pros  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ) imagine it on hard mode, on hard mode they are a lot smarter and they ussually find a good cover, they also have more ressistance to bullets so they aren’t stupid and easy to kill.</p>

<p>So if you think the AI is stupid, then all you have to do is act stupider at it will seem smarter by comparison? Hell, why would you go in with Pistol or SMG when you ALWAYS have the Gravity gun in Episode 2 and throwing objects at the Hunters works about 10x more effectively than any type of ammo in the game?</p>

</aside>
<p>In my experience the rebels easily obliterate the combine unless they throw a grenade and they forget to run away. But that’s just gameplay, in HL1 the guards would normally take down a marine over long range because of their much better accuracy, they were dead at short range though.</p>

<p>There is no other way he could have escaped from all of those aliens in HL1, all but destroyed the Combine in HL2, and then utterly destroy the Combine through HL2:Ep1 and HL2:Ep2!</p>

            <p>The combine forces you fight in HL2/Episodes is like a tiny, tiny fraction of their full force. When they invaded, they probably used some of their real scary shit because earth got it’s ass kicked in only a few hours. You start HL2 like 15-20 years after these events so all thats left now is a few transhuman soldiers and some synths to keep an eye on things.</p>
<p>Thats why you were trying to close the portal in EP2. If it re-opened, the combine would be back and probably packing some of their real toys. Gordon wouldn’t have stood a chance.</p>

<p>So if you think the AI is stupid, then all you have to do is act stupider at it will seem smarter by comparison? Hell, why would you go in with Pistol or SMG when you ALWAYS have the Gravity gun in Episode 2 and throwing objects at the Hunters works about 10x more effectively than any type of ammo in the game?</p>

            <p>all I can say about all the relpies ya made:</p>
<p>1 smg grenade launchers: valve didn’t implemented it because if the combine soldiers could all throw grenades, combine balls (I think the could in beta without needing to be elite) and grenades you could be f***k’d up with a lot of gibs around you and your weapon in China for the explosions. Even valve get some smg of the beta wich got a grenade launcher and then put the same functions on another model wich REALLY HAVEN’T GOT A FREGGIN GRENADE LAUNCHER.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Helicopters: the helicopter has been modiffied don’t say it’s low-tech</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gmod Artificial Intelligence and ressistance of NPCs: in Gmod the friendly npcs (excepting kleiner, magnusson and eli) has been modiffied to have a BETTER AI and MOAR hp than enemy npcs that’s the cause the combine took only 3 shots on the leg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advisors/synths/sirurgical operations and technollogy: the combine adapt their troops to their world that means: the humans they captured/ joined them got transformed into half cyborg troops as seen in an easter egg on the road of the coast wich you can see the organs of a monkey, a normal human and a CP officer. Also means put robotic arms to the advisors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI: If you think the combine are ‘‘stupid’’ and ‘‘easy to kill’’ play ep2 hard mode and try to kill a freggin hunter alone with a smg1 or a pistol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About the low-tech: if the combine were low-tech enemies they would have created the Stunstick, the ar2, the synths, the crab mines, and the S.L.A.M. (I dunno if the S.L.A.M. is combine made or human made but it seems a high-tech C4 like with 2 modes)?</p>
</li>

            <p>/\ That.</p>
<p>I very much doubt that sentient life throughout the universe would be THAT tough they would need such crazy crap you imagine.</p>
<p>I mean seriously, other than freeman, who the hell is going to be able to stop an invasion army of synths? Oh yeah, that dimension where everythings 100x the size of everything here, and everythings bullet and psychic proof? :S</p>
<p>I mean come on, what do you expect to be in another dimension?</p>
<p>( i say this knowing the complete retardedness of the answers about to come )</p>
