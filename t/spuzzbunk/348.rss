            <p>Nice work with the doors and all. But threre are few things you should do:<br>
1st. The sounds are horribofuckus. Especially the elevator. I actually had to mute during it.<br>
2nd. Buttons. Buttons and more buttons. Enough with the buttons. I suggest that you remove the buttons and automate the doors to open when approached.<br>
3rd. Speed up the doors or cut something out. They seem to take ridiculously long amount of time to open/close.</p>
<p>But overall neat job  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Aw, no fair. I edit a Q3 based game too and there’s no real-time rendering going on there. I have to wait ~20 minutes for a full compile.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>So far, Radiant 3 (DOOMedit) is really really nice. Of course some shadows are precalculated where possible, but for the most part, you can go through your map rendered in realtime and watch your models ‘animate’, listen to sounds, etc. The BSP compile usually takes a couple of seconds depending on how many monsters there are on the map, and you can jump right in the game in ~7 seconds after you finish mapping.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I know it may be a little late for this, but I suggest you take out a lot of the buttons. It  ruins the flow of the map when you have to get out of the car and press a button. I think it’d be a lot better if more of the doors opened automatically. Also, the second door has a tiny inconspicuous keypad, I think it’d look better if you did something to draw attention to the keypad, like a light and a metal panel behind the keypad. Same with the elevator’s keypad, but I think it’d be even better to get rid of the elevator keypad and have the elevator act automatically.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, I did consider making the map autonomous at one point, but alas, I was too lazy. My thinking behind the small keypads is that normally this bunker would be manned, and there would be people in a security room somewhere deep within that would be activating the entrance doors, whereas someone with high clearance could do it themselves. The keypads aren’t meant to be the primary means of operating said doors, although you have to use them.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yep, like I said, there are a few shadows that the game knows won’t move that can be pre-calculated, but for the most part it’s all done in real time. It’s really nice, considering I have an AIDS processor and Vrad took forever, I usually just disabled vis or did a fast vis using Hammer. This way, I can see the finished map in seconds. I’ve never attempted a full Source compile with even a few lights…</p>
<p>And as for the vmf’s, it’s my pleasure. Of course, some credit goes to Viktor_Berg for a few components  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  The only thing I ask is that if you use them, you have to show me where :lol:</p>
<p>So far, other than a few glitches and things to get used to, I really like Radiant. There are some things that are much nicer than Hammer, like ‘face dragging’ instead of just scaling (the best thing I can compare it to is the Push-Pull function of Sketchup) and of course the fact that Doom 3 is running and its a lot faster. The editor camera is much clunkier than Hammer though, and getting around the grid is a little different to get used to…</p>
<p>PS. 3D clipping tool is AWESOME</p>

<p>Delving a little deeper into the Doom3 Editor and I have discovered that there is a realtime rendered and lit preview which will prove to be very useful. This is made possible because Doom 3 is actually still running while you are in the editor! A quick tap of F2 brings up Doom3 and you can load up your newly-tweaked maps in seconds. This is much more efficient than the Hammer/HL2 process. A quick recompile of BSP data is required, but this takes seconds. Compiling is greatly reduced due to real time lighting. Considering that a lot of the stuff in my Spuzzbunk map was Doom inspired, I think this is going to be a positive change for my mapping skills.</p>

            <p>Sooooooo, huge bump. As you guys can tell, I’ve pretty much lost interest in the Spuzzbunk.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  (Although, I still have the .vmf’s if anybody would like to have them and have a go at finishing it :lol <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>However, I’m really into Doom 3 right now, and I’m gonna get myself started mapping in the Doom 3 engine because I like dynamic lights and no compiling and Doom 3 runs better on my computer than HL2. Plus it’s got a lot better industrial textures, models, elevators, shit like that. I might use this thread if I get anything worth showing made up… Sound good?</p>

            <p>Seriously though four solid minutes of elaborate doors is a little much. I’d consider chopping some sections out and condensing it a bit, keeping just the more funky and interesting ones. Foreplay is good and all, but sooner or later you just want to <span class="bbcode-i">get stuck in</span>, you know?</p>

            <p>It’s supposed to be a half-secret underground bunker. Of course, it is quite unfinished, and not connected yet. The video I posted is the entrance of the bunker, I have yet to make the core area and add on the power dome, the armory, a missile silo, warehouse… etc. I’ve been working on it for liek ever…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>So what is this, a mod comprised entirely of driving a few metres, then getting out and pressing buttons to watch elaborate doors open, over and over and over?</p>
