NOTE_2:
I tried various Video options, though i keep my settings marked with *.
So, yes, CSM doesn&#39;t work for me. In fact i can&#39;t even see the change. At any setting.
Believe me, i checked the pictures on the forums and in-game. No new CSM anywhere,
but the PC still had struggle to run the game with only CSM being a new turned ON option.

Here&#39;s the list of issues found:

1. Ragdoll physics bug.
If a zombie is killed in anyway where the headcrab would fall of the body, the headcrab would levitate in mid-air, with his legs grabing
some invisible surface. He can be moved, and eventually after hitting it many times, falls down to the ground.
This happened to me at that 3 level garage with a hole in the middle, on the last floor where the zombies are.

If you kill HECU soldiers with their bodies in one piece, save the game and reload the saved game,
they will have their limbs stretched across the floor and into the ground. You couldn&#39;t hit the bodies, neither did the props around.
This happened in the garage where you fall from an air duct.

2. Much stuttering, very lag.
Large 3-5 seconds lags on every large map area with many NPC and particles.
It was everywhere in the new STU maps with the CSM turned ON. When disabled, it worked better.

3. He&#39;s dead, Jim.
I got a crash with no messages and a crash with ran out of memory message.

Conclusion:
After i lowered the Video settings down, the game was playable again.</description>
