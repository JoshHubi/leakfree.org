            <p>I think you’ll probably be able to run the game, but probably only on lowest settings, and possibly still with lag.<br>
It’s a free download, so you can always just try  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Do you know if you can play any other games and how well? It seems to be on the low end of low end cards from what I can find so from that I would say probably not. But try playing something like TF2 and see how it runs. If you can barely play TF2 then you most likely won’t be able to play Black Mesa very well if at all.</p>
