    <title>Weapon Choose not working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weapon-choose-not-working/11000</link>
    <description>Hi Guys,

I played your game now until the point when I get the pistol and the grenades. When I got them I wanted to scrolll through my weapons and it didn&#39;t work. I also tried the numbers. After I threw all my grenades the game automatically equipped my pistol. When I choose a weapon, in the left top of the screen, the right weapon is displayed but I always hold my pistol.
The Game is installed in the right folder and Source SDK 2007 is updated.

My Specs (Just in case it has to do something with this):
OS: Windows 7 Enterprise 32 Bit
CPU: Intel Core2Duo E8200 @ 3,1GHZ
GPU: ATI Radeon HD5850
RAM: 2GB DDR2 Samsung
Mainboard: ASUS P5KPL/1600

Greetings,
Leon</description>

            <p>Hi Leon,</p>
<p>In the options you can configure which keys bind to what actions, like you can do for any Source game.  In the main menu go to “Options” and then “Keyboard”.  There you can configure which keys you want to use for weapon up/weapon down.  By default the scroll wheel on the mouse works for changing weapons though.  I’m not entirely sure, but those settings might be shared across some Source games - that could explain why you have settings other than the default.</p>
