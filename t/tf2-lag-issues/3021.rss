    <title>TF2 Lag Issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tf2-lag-issues/3021</link>
    <description>Lately I have not been playing TF2 much, this is mainly due to the fact the I am always getting seeming unexplained lag. It&#39;s not FPS lag (Stable @ 60fps+, I&#39;ve even tried dropping reso and other graphics settings too).
However, ping is fine (~50-80), choke and loss are minimal (&lt;5) and the cl_interp_* values are at default.
Does anyone have any other suggestions as to what it could be?</description>

</aside>
<p>If you can join servers normally but they don’t show up in the list, you’re probably not able to connect to the Steam master server.</p>
<p>It could be your router (if you have any) blocking a port or maybe just a problem in the Steam servers… it’s rare but they do go down sometimes, and you can’t browse through any servers when they are down.</p>
<p>Might want to keep a few servers on your Favorites list to avoid that to an extent  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> . If you are still having this issue, try opening the port used to connect to the Master Server (probably the default one for the game, 27015 I guess?) and see if it helps.</p>

            <p>If you were having this when killing someone or dying, and your game would like stutter for a split second, it was a problem caused by an update a few days ago, and it was fixed yesterday (I think).</p>
<p>If it’s constant, you might want to limit your fps rate so you don’t get many fluctuations, they can be kinda annoying when it’s constantly going from 150 to 60 fps. Also if you run an AntiVirus try adding the TF2 folder as an exception for continuous scans, because the game usually writes log files to your folder, and every time they get rewritten your AntiVirus scans them for Viruses again, hurting performance.</p>
<p>Other than that I have no idea what it could be… maybe try disabling Steam Cloud sync in the multiplayer tab if it’s on. It has been added recently and has been known for causing issues to a few people.</p>

            <p>I’ve been having the same problem as well. I ALWAYS have my antivirus software on, and I have never experienced this kind of lag before unless it was ping related. I asked over team chat, and some of the guys on both teams said they were having momentary lag spikes as well. I’m stumped.:[</p>
