    <description>Why do none of the military radios in the game work? IMO it would help a lot with immersion and moving the story along if they did. Have them talk about cleaning the place out in &#39;weve got hostiles&#39; Talk about looking out for freeman in &#39;On a Rail&#39; Talk about alien invasion part way through &#39;Surface Tension&#39;</description>

            <p>LOL I’m military…</p>
<p>During one of our exercises I was checking the contamination stands, and found contamination and reported it… I was asked via radio what color the contamination was… at which point I responded “I have no idea I’m color blind”… keep in mind over 100 people are listening in on this conversation… it became a squadron joke for months to come.</p>
<p>Just thought I’d share a radio story…</p>

            <p>Yes. It helped in establishing a bond and connection to other fellow rebels that are fighting the same battle as you.</p>
<p>In would be great if interaction with some of the radios would produce messages or dialog from other scientists or guards trying to reach other possible survivors or giving warnings to avoid certain parts of Black Mesa.</p>

</aside>
<p>Does it have to be a big deal? There are military radios in the game. It makes sense to expect them to do the radio thing. Plus, as others have mentioned, this is the perfect hook to provide some extra exposition and some extra immersion.</p>
<p>Consider the radios in Half-Life 2 in the Route Kanal section. You’ll walk into a safehouse where everyone has been massacred by Combine forces, and you’ll hear a radio blaring: “Station 8, do you read? Combine forces are sweeping the area and flooding the sewers with Manhacks. Get out of there! Station 8, do you read? Station 8, are you there?” I’m paraphrasing a bit as my memory isn’t photographic, but that little bit of radio chatter both adds to the tragedy and to my sense of immersion, showing me that even though I don’t run across them, many other stations also exist.</p>

</aside>
<p>Completely agree, though it would be even better if the snatches of dialogue could indirectly provide exposition about the state of the facility from the military’s point of view. Near the start of Doom 3, you pick up randomised snatches of radio chatter from fellow soldiers in various states of about-to-be-deadness; it’s <span class="bbcode-i">incredibly</span> atmospheric and immersive. Wouldn’t require much extra coding either; mainly just some writing, some voice acting and some sound processing.</p>
<p>I’ve always felt that HL did too little with its military radios too, and that Opposing Force could have taken them further than it did.</p>

            <p>Having the radios play chatter wouldn’t be a bad idea, I admit. I never thought to expect it, however, as they didn’t in Half-Life. They just made a chirping buzzing sound and broke when I hit it with my crowbar.</p>
<p>But yes, a bit more Marine chatter that’s less over-the-top might help counter-balance some of the cheesier lines they have.</p>

            <p>I agree, like there are caged doors with a lock on them, the weird thing is I thought it can be shot or taken down with a crowbar, but well… there’s a radio behind it.<br>
Actually giving them a purpose, like the soldiers using them to call reinforcements would be nice, also an achievement for destroying them all ;D</p>
