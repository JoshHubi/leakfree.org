    <title>Nit-pick: Magnum and Crowbar</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/nit-pick-magnum-and-crowbar/9851</link>
    <description>Both of those are very minor points, but I want to bring them up anyway:

The Crowbar: The weapon model itself is gorgeous. It looks exactly like what a crowbar should. It&#39;s just that its swing animation is weird. Maybe I&#39;m just too used to Gordon attacking with wide, diagonal swings, but the &quot;pecking&quot; motion of the crowbar just doesn&#39;t do it for me. Especially since you don&#39;t see the arm. It&#39;s actually the same problem I had with the crowbar in L4D2 - the survivors use it weird.

The Magnum: The weapon itself is awesome and I love how it feels, but why are the holes on the drum painted-on? This is a close-up asset, it&#39;s in our faces, so that kind of shortcut becomes very obvious, very fast. All of the other weapons are exquisitely detailed, but this one just seems out of place. I&#39;d honestly like to see the drum remade to have actual 3D mesh holes in it for the rounds to go in. It would improve the weapon tremendously, in my opinion.</description>

<p>Isn’t that the model from the high-definition mod for the old game courtesy of Blue Shift? I agree, I LOVE that crowbar. It looks bigger and more detailed than the Half-Life 2 one which is kind of skinny and not very worn off. Plus, I actually prefer the octagonal iron bar because this gives the texture room to be more convincing, by concentrating paint wear on the edges. I’d LOVE to have that crowbar, with the hand, and with the old swinging animation.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think the range of the crowbar is way too little, when u swing with one in real life, the range is bigger than ingame, and Freeman not just gonna hit them with this arm near his body, but use his arm at maximum range and use the crowbar as an extension of his arm</p>

<p>The Action mods for Quake 2, Half-Life, UT and HL2 do this.  It totally changes what reloading means, and makes keeping track of ammo count much more important; I wish it was an option for all FPS games, BM included.  I know the FireArms mod for HL did the R6-style mag-tracking.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Firearms! Of course, that’s what I was thinking of. I remember playing this with friends of mine to great length. Sadly, it came out in the wake of Counter-Strike, which doomed every other Half-Life mod to obscurity. Ever seen that Natural Selection II game that’s on sale over Steam right now? Yeah, that used to be an awesome mod for Half-Life back in the day, but I could never find a single other person who played it, and back then I was limited to Internet cafes locked in a city-wide LAN. And no-one in the city played it.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I actually replayed Half-Life 2, and I know why I picked on the magnum in Black Mesa but not there. Half-Life 2 has a reload animation that does a great job of hiding the face of the drum. Basically, you see Gordon shake the gun with shells sliding out, but just before they fall out, the drum drops below the screen so you don’t actually see the empty holes. Gordon then jams a new clip of bullets off-screen and the first time you see the drum again, it already has bullets beginning to be chambered in the holes.</p>
<p>Black Mesa has a very different animations. You basically see Gordon pull the six-pack of bullets out and apparently fling them to the right under his arm. This whole time, you’re looking at the empty drum head-on. I get a good second of looking at those black holes. Half-Life 2 knows the drum has had serious shortcuts taken with it, so the animation is designed to hide those shortcuts. If Black Mesa wants to show off the magnum with the new animation, then the drum needs to be worth showing off.</p>
<p>And again - giving it actual 3D mesh holes is all it will take.</p>

            <p>I am ok with the magnum but I do feel that the MOD would benefit reverting back to the Crow bar from HL2… Because of the swing action is better… Or improve the animation on the crowbar.</p>

<p>They can fade out of existence after a while, like the discarded .357 shells or other ejected brass or debris.  IIRC Half-life did it.  That tinkle of shells is a really nice, immersive touch, I’d like a steely clatter for the MP5 and a plasticky clack for the Glock.</p>

<p>Receiver, by Wolfire Games.  The whole point of that game is to simulate real firearm operation.  You pick up individual bullets and have to load magazines yourself in real time, manually insert magazines, pull the slide, release the slide catch.  You have to be careful all the time, and literally every bullet counts.  It’s a fabulous game, really tense.</p>

<p>I forget what game it was, but I recall an FPS which didn’t give you an ammo counter for spare rounds, but rather a counter for spare magazines. If you threw out a half-empty magazine, it was GONE with anything left in it. I also remember a game doing the Raibow Six thing, where it kept a magazine half-filled if you reloaded too early and would eventually cycle it back into the gun if you kept reloading. I might be thinking of SWAT 4.</p>

</aside>
<p>The Action mods for Quake 2, Half-Life, UT and HL2 do this.  It totally changes what reloading means, and makes keeping track of ammo count much more important; I wish it was an option for all FPS games, BM included.  I know the FireArms mod for HL did the R6-style mag-tracking.</p>

<p>I forget what game it was, but I recall an FPS which didn’t give you an ammo counter for spare rounds, but rather a counter for spare magazines. If you threw out a half-empty magazine, it was GONE with anything left in it.

<hr>
<p>On topic: I just realised something odd. Replaying Half-Life with the Blue Shift high-definition pack gives me a Magnum that actually has a 3D mesh for a drum head. The way the reload animation is done, I don’t think the entire cartridge chambers are drawn and they still have a “black hole texture” covering them, but that texture is sunk into the drum head so it looks like the chamber is fully detailed. Frankly… I like the Blue Shift HD Magnum model better, if for no reason other than it doesn’t show the shortcut drum head.</p>
<p>I honestly believe - and I still do - that the Magnum will benefit from additional detailing. It’s a great gun, but that drum just always bugs me when I see it.</p>
<hr>
<p>As for the Crowbar: I just replayed Half-Life, and I noticed something - the “pecking” animation exists there, too, but it’s one of three. Gordon has a VERY long right-to-left swing, a fairly short left-to-right swing and what Black Mesa gives him. I don’t know how he chooses to alternate, but both of the cut swings show his HEV-suited arm, which to me makes the weapon much more immerisve. I’ve always enjoyed seeing my characters’ arms on guns, not just the gun itself.</p>

            <p>I agree with pretty much all of the comments regarding the magnum. I think the model is fundamentally fine, but it needs significant refinement. The holes should be 3D, and the entire gun, iron sites included, would benefit from a higher resolution texture. Also, I feel like it should be shiny. It’s not shiny. It was shiny as fuck in HL1, and shiny as fuck in HL2. It should be shiny in BMS. Shit, the oil barrels are shiny in BMS, so should the magnum.</p>

<p>This is true to a point.  The model mesh is the HL2 one, I think, but the skin is new, or at least seems so.  In a way I miss the shiny chrome, but this satin finish is lovely too.</p>
<p>HL2 didn’t have the iron sight mode on its Magnum.  That’s a new animation presumably made specifically for Black Mesa.  Non-iron sight, it’s fine and works properly.  It’s just the new animation that’s wrong.  It’s such a shame, as the meaty impression of recoil in the animation is absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>One new thing I’ve noticed, though: the magnum drops shell casings when you reload (which is really nice - love that tinkle!) but the Glock and MP5 don’t drop empty magazines.  So really, that’s a nit-pick with those.</p>

<p>The magazines would look identical to those you can pick up, so it would be too confusing.</p>
