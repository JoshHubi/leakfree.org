            <p>yeah it wouldn’t show me layers and if i tried to move it around in AE it just moved the whole picture not the layers. but i’ve decided to try and do everything i’m trying to do through AE it takes longer but it works.</p>
<p>also i think may have something to do with the fact that i have illustrator CS3 and After effects CS4</p>
