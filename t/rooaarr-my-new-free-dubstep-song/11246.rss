    <title>Rooaarr! -My new free dubstep song :)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rooaarr-my-new-free-dubstep-song/11246</link>
    <description>Download now!-&gt; [url]https://kiwi6.com/file/90w82yk1h9[/url]

Don&#39;t usually post a new thread for one of my songs, but I couldn&#39;t help myself.
My long awaited new song- Roooaaarrr! Spent many sleepless nights on this, and It feels like my ear drums are burnt out. Every sound is custom made like always, and there&#39;s 10 different basses alone in this song. A lot of the percussion was made with my beatboxing skillz, just a fun fact. Hope everybody who listens to this doesn&#39;t have crappy speakers and enjoys it  :wink:</description>

            <p>I’m very sorry. The mixing and production is decent. but the track itself is way to repetetive for my taste.</p>
