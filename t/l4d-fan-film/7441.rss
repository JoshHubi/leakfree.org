<p>What helps them out is the less is more factor.  They’re not required to do much so the acting doesn’t take front stage, which is smart on the part of the director.</p>
<p>The main guy is good, keeps it natural in his facial and voice performance.</p>
<p>The asian is kind of ridiculous, the hair-cut doesn’t really fit with someone in that kind of situation.  People usually become more pragmatic in war time. His acting with that hologram on his arm was hilarious.  Way too into it for me to believe that he’s familiar with using it.</p>
<p>The girl doesn’t do too much but she suffers what they all suffer from, which is that they don’t react a whole lot.  They all hold a natural expression pretty well but when things happen they look awkwardly stiff.  The asian guy gets shot and just convulses with this deadpan look, likewise the girl skips around when she shoots those two guys.  They just don’t seem very…intent on what they’re doing.</p>
<p>It was really well done, though.  I’d say the director really knew what he was doing.  Considering the budget constraints the visuals didn’t look bad.  They’re were some lighting issues I would have done differently but not shabby at all.  The editing really helps it a lot too.  They held on a few shots for too long, but I say the majority was really well paced.</p>
<p>Definitely one of the better fan films I’ve seen.  Still isn’t something I’d probably watch again, though.  Fan films are really impressive in how people get motivated to actually finish them on such shoe string limitations, but I usually find them to be totally uninteresting.</p>
<p>Most of the time people just scrape together a plot and some resources because they want to do “this type of movie” instead of actually having a vision for a story and the franchise they’re using happens to serve that story.  If you want to tell a story and a zombie apocalypse setting serves it, then I want to see that film.  However, if you want to make a zombie movie and you know that you have to make the story good, it’ll probably, at best, be decent because you really don’t have any inspiration for it.</p>

            <p>I would love to see Valve make an actual film based within the Half-life universe…  I think I remember hearing/reading about Valve wanting to do it.</p>

            <p>I like how Francis went from 6’5" to 5"2" and Louis is now 7’0"</p>
<p>The actors look/sound the parts. Guess that’s enough to nullify not being able to play the part.</p>

            <p>Pretty cool, although I agree the acting could use a little work, Zoe looked like she couldn’t give less of a shit about anything, we’ll just see how the final product turns out.</p>

<p>God, the acting is absolutely awful.  Of course, I’ve never seen a fan film with good acting.  I know people went gaga over that Fallout short a while back but it was pretty poor in that department also.</p>
<p>If they’re using a boom, whoever was supposed to bounce to Louis didn’t do their job.</p>
<p>And I don’t think the DP knows how to light a shot.  He got some rim on Francis, which was nice, but a lot of these images aren’t balanced and there’s too many hot spots.  Even with low budget lights (you’d be amazed what quality you can get with lights from Home Depot), you gotta get a meter out there and make sure your image isn’t just busting 100% white all over the place.</p>
