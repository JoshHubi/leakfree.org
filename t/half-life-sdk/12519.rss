    <description>Interestingly enough Valve has chosen to release a proper [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/games/70/announcements/detail/2199168953699017707&#39;]Half-Life SDK[/url] on Steam. It can be found in the tools tab. They have also [url=&#39;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife&#39;]released a new source code[/url] that allows for Mac and Linux HL1 mods.

            <p>I remember downloading one of the old HL SDK builds as a ZIP file back in the day. I seem to recall there were two versions, one with barebones code and a couple of example maps (c1a0 being the foremost one) and another “full” one with model source files, including ones not distributed in the final game.</p>
<p>It’s never come with a launcher, though. I kinda have to wonder, even with Mac and Linux support, why they would bother making a new release after all this time.<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]Especially when the Source SDK is constantly broken, lol.</p>
