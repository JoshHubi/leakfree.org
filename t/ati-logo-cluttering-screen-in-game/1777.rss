    <title>ATI Logo Cluttering Screen In-Game?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ati-logo-cluttering-screen-in-game/1777</link>
    <description>For whatever reason, ATI has suddenly decided today that it wants to advertise itself every time I launch a game. It doesn&#39;t matter what game it is, steam or non-steam, there is always now this ATI Crossfire logo in the upper right of my screen. Here&#39;s a screenshot:

Anybody have any idea why that might be there or how to get rid of it?
Card: ATI Radeon HD3870 x2

The game in the picture is &quot;Myst Uru&quot; if you want to know.</description>

            <p>Awesome, thanks. I’m not really sure why anyone in their right mind would want that checked, but whatever.</p>
<p>In other news, this appears to be my 100th post.</p>

            <p>I just found where to turn off the setting. Right click the ATI logo on the notification bar and u should see something that says ATI Radeon 3800 series, put ur mouse over that and something should appear that says crossfirex settings. Put ur mouse over that and u should see somethin called Show CrossfireX status icon. If it has a checkmark next to it, then click it and that should disable the ATI logo.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure I have that driver. I’ll redownload it using that link just to be sure, though.</p>
<p>Update: Aaaahhh! That didn’t fix it! Now I have to search through the Control Center, which seems to have a new layout I really don’t like.</p>
<p>Update 2: I can’t find anything in the control center. This is so weird, it never happened before today and I shouldn’t have anything new with my graphics card.</p>

            <p>In some of the older versions of catalyst there was an option that enabled catalyst to display a logo in the corner of any game that uses crossfireX to show the the user that the game is using that feature. This option was implemented back when very few games utilized multiple gpu’s, crossfireX or SLI, and has been removed in newer catalyst’s. You can get the latest version <a href="https://game.amd.com/us-en/drivers_catalyst.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <p>I should I have the latest drivers, the date doesn’t look any different from the last time I checked the site, but I suppose I should update them just to see if anything happens.</p>
