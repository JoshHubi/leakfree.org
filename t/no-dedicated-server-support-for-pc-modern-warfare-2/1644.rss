Call of Duty community manager Rob Bowling, also known as &#39;fourzerotwo&#39;, has confirmed in a podcast that the PC version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will not support user-created mods. Worse, it will not support dedicated servers. PC gamers will have to suffer peer-to-peer connections, just like their console-owning cousins.

I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of PC gamers suddenly cried out in terror, and were silenced.

</aside>
<p>I didn’t buy MW2. I rented it for my “ShitBox 360” as many here would call it.<br>
I’m not THAT dumb.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
The only reason I plan on getting the 360 version for Christmas is because most of my friends, fuck it, all of my friends are playing the 360 version. When it comes to multiplayer games, I go where they go.</p>
<p>But I refuse to play L4D2 on the 360! I upgraded my PC for two reasons: Black Mesa, and Valve.</p>
<p>Are we done with this thread yet? We get it. IW apparently sucks. Valve is awesome. Let’s move on to the next realistic modern war shooter that RESPECTS PC gamers <span class="bbcode-i">(Battlefield: Bad Company 2. Destructible Environments + Dedicated Servers = Fuck Call of Duty.)</span></p>

            <p>Just because some old DVAR’s were in IW’s file doesn’t mean dedicated servers are still supported.<br>
IW uses the same engine every time usually with minor upgrades, they have standard models for a lot of things which they adapt over time and some dedicated stuff was left in there.</p>
<p>Mods are impossible, apart from the music and some game sounds all the raw files are compressed within FastFiles located in /zone.</p>
<p>You can decompile these files using a decompiler made by someone in the CoD community but it will only work on text files (like scripts) but not stuff like models/sounds or gamefiles (weapons etc.).</p>
<p>Even if they were too lazy to make a tool that explains how to use the modtools they could still release the rawfile which is nothing more than copy/paste and then upload because experienced modders know how to use them.<br>
They’ll never release them though because that means players could make their own maps and nobody would buy their mappacks (doesn’t matter anyway you need dedi servers run your maps on)</p>
<p>Soz for the bad English it’s kinda late.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Okay, I’ll give you an argument:</span> Lack of clan support.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">My response:</span> MW2 supports SeamWorks. Which means you can invite friends in a similar way to XBox Live. Now, DON’T FREAK OUT! I know I just compared something to a console feature (ooooh! Scary!) but it actually makes it easier to play with friends. And isn’t that what multiplayer is for?<br>
But back to my overall point: You know that “MW2 Boycott” that’s full of hypocrites? Well, there you have it: A Clan! Yes, SteamGroups is just a fancy way of saying “clans.”<br>
Invite all your friends/clansmen <span class="bbcode-i">(or random strangers)</span> and play together in ranked matches, or host custom matches <span class="bbcode-i">(I believe that’s an option in all platforms, right?)</span> The only thing bad is that you have to invite whoever in your clan that wants to play to join, but if you want to play against random people, that’s what the first option is for!</p>
<p>And to everyone that is proudly proclaiming “Hazzah! I pirated MW2!” I just want you to know that I don’t give a shit anymore. Go ahead! You’re only digging PC gaming’s grave, a platfrom you apparently love sooooooooo fucking much.</p>

</aside>
<p>You just described a stipped down dedi… Dedicated servers allow random people and clan members alike, to join <span class="bbcode-i">at any time</span>, not just when invited. That is the power of a dedicated server. The ability to let people search for a server that is akin to their liking and join up at any time. They also allow whole communities to be formed so that people can play with the same group of people at any time they want, not just when that player invites them.</p>
<p>No one wants to play on a custom server if they can’t even level up. Whats the point except every once and a while. Otherwise you’ll never get new weapons, game-types (worst decision ever to exclude game-types until a certain level) and other goodies.</p>
<p>In our clan server for World at War we have a mod (yes custom content FTW) that levels a person up to the max so that they have access to everything from the beginning allowing everyone to be on a level playing field. The mod also allows for you to customize classes in-game instead of waiting for lobby time or exiting out of the server.</p>

I know I just compared something to a console feature (ooooh! Scary!) but it actually makes it easier to play with friends. And isn’t that what multiplayer is for?<br>
But back to my overall point: You know that “MW2 Boycott” that’s full of hypocrites? Well, there you have it: A Clan! Yes, SteamGroups is just a fancy way of saying “clans.”<br>
Invite all your friends/clansmen <span class="bbcode-i">(or random strangers)</span> and play together in ranked matches, or host custom matches <span class="bbcode-i">(I believe that’s an option in all platforms, right?)</span> The only thing bad is that you have to invite whoever in your clan that wants to play to join, but if you want to play against random people, that’s what the first option is for!</p>
<p>And to everyone that is proudly proclaiming “Hazzah! I pirated MW2!” I just want you to know that I don’t give a shit anymore. Go ahead! You’re only digging PC gaming’s grave, a platfrom you apparently love sooooooooo fucking much.</p>

            <p>I’m not mad about the lack of leaning because it’s a feature that’s valuable to the game; I’m mad about the lack of leaning because it’s a feature that’s historically been in the PC version and not the console version, and now it’s a sign that they made a shitty console port. I’ve heard only bad things about the matchmaking, not the least of which is that the host has a ridiculous advantage.</p>

<p>I don’t see the reason that a company would refuse to support mods.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Neither do I, but for some reason IW didn’t support mods for MW2. Thus there’s no SDK for the MW2 engine. Thus there’s no custom maps. Thus there’s no reason to support dedicated servers since you can’t play on custom maps.</p>
<p>Really, at this point, all it is now is a browser. A retard, and that includes console-tards, can understand a browser. So there’s nothing “super awesome PC gaming hardcore” about it. And from unbiased user reviews (ie people who BOUGHT the game), the matchmaking system works very well and the majority of their game sessions had next to no lag.</p>
<p>Great, so now I’m back to not understanding why this is such a big deal.</p>
