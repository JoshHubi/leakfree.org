    <description>Suggest a model for brian to make in this thread not in the the developer section.

Brian may like an idea or not like any of our ideas.

But what the hell just treat this thread as unofficial and fun for models you would like to see in Black Mesa with absoluteley no guarentees that any will be altered or made.

This must pertain to environment or vehicle only

Ok I will suggest a wall mounted defibrilator. they are more common place now days. I am talking about emergency defibrillators not ones in the hospital that are dedicated.</description>

            <p>sorry guys if you want to merge this thread into that one I dont have any issues with that or shut this thread and lock.</p>
<p>The roller steps would replace the all too conveinient crates and boxes I guess in some places. But I say that without meaning I dislike the pre-built crates or structures that lead to a vent or conveyor belt just could be more interesting to have to put roller stairs in their place. Where it could become more interesting is when the stairs don’t actually reach the place you need to get to so you may have to travel along a ledge or something.</p>
<p>Anyway I won’t post anymore here as per request. Like I said I only created this because I wanted to focus on models only. And be more interactive type of models mainly rather than aesthetics.</p>
<p>I also want to applaud whoever came up with the small jumping puzzles where you land on different textures and the footsteps sounds change with each platform. This is genius and actually really groundbreaking. It just feels really cool.</p>

            <p>Props and models are usually made on request from the level designers on a need to have basis. Over time this generates a catalog of props for all of the level designers to chose from and implement in other places of the game. Rarely are props made before they have an intended purpose.</p>

<p>I’ve never experienced that, but I can’t be certain. I highly doubt it, though, as there’s never a time that it’s used as far as I can recall.

<p>I do think the moveable stairs would be a good idea <span class="bbcode-i">for another game</span>, though. While that’s actually not a bad idea, I can’t think of a spot it would fit in Black Mesa.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It doesn’t work anything like that.</p>
<p>The camera and security screens render a static image from the location of a camera entity, this doesn’t work for mirrors because a mirror looks different when viewing it from different angles.</p>
<p>The magnifying glass and crossbow scope are only copies of what’s being rendered on screen with warping being applied to it, won’t work for anything else.</p>

<p>I can’t recall seeing anything like this in a fps before and i think it’s an interesting real world prop that has obvious and un-obvious connotations but like i s.aid i feel i had a false eureaka moment The main problem is that there is no player model that throws it out the window.</p>
<p>So I want to continue a bit on interactivity and if you like this is a “what if” scenario for half life. to be precise what if Half life was first released this year. What conjuring could we have perhaps expected to see going off previous evidence of interactivity with world obkects such as the fire extinguisher from Half life 2 Beta.</p>
<p>Half life purists please don’t pooh pooh me this will be a simple exploration into life being perhaps better without the gravity gun from Half life 2.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">The Roller props</span></span></p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Roller dumpster - this I imagine as a moving shield on wheels. the player can see over it but while crouched can not see but is shielded from bullets. The dumpster can be pushed faster while standing but while crouched slow crouched walking is only manageable. Upon use this will grab the dumpster whilst using the dumpster use again will release but momentum will carry on. also giving it ramming capabilities say if you rolled it down a slope. Indestructable<br>

<p>Goods trolley. works on the same mechanics as the dumpster but has no shield or cover. The only thing about this is you can load it with satchels and send it down a slope both destroying the trolley and your enemies upon detonation<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Steps on wheels again using a similar mechanic but this is more a puzzle based iteration of the other wheeled items. This would not allow momentum once finished on use.</p>
<p>I am sure there is physics mechanics that allow momentum wheel based objects atleast I think there is. I wanted to explore this here for people to see that bit more of interactivity with the world. These props would all use the same base but have different tops almost modular if you like. Whilst using left and right would act as a rotate function. with forward backward and sprint actions allowed.</p>
<p>The other thought I have had regarding crates or even crago container, is that I really want an opportunity to drop a crate on a marine from above either this could be done through a lever mechanic or even the blue crate It would again be an interesting use of a prop. Death from above.</p>
<p>Again here is another focus on an interactive prop. Probably will be the one people like the most.</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Yep the toilet and the inspiration has come from kleiners lab mini teleporter. except when you put a small item in the toilet it won’t come back.</p>
<p>I would say a headcrab can be flushed and smaller objects other wise it won’t make the object disappear.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>The way most reflections work in Source would render something like that useless as to actually seeing the enemy - specular reflections use cubemaps, which are pre-rendered.<br>
Also then you’d need a playermodel or it’d look odd, which isn’t going to happen any time soon in a HL game.</p>

            <p>forgive me If I am wrong but where it is in it’s original location.</p>
<p>Is it in the area in black mesa where the scientist lowers the ladder before you go to lambda core?</p>
<p>Because Black Mesa has a second set of “Blast Doors” these doors could open and the agrunt could be out there on a sentry gunning on the sentry. But If it’s not there then well I am actually going to look for it tomorrow because I don’t remember it to be honest.<br>
edit: OMG Forget about freeman uncut!!!</p>
<p>I have also had a number of other thoughts today. Actually modelling a fire bell and and making a new material for it to be “bell” so if you shoot it it will make a ding.</p>
<p>I also walked past what I thought was the most amazing prop suggestion for Black mesa only to discover after thinking about it a bit more it was totally a no go. Urggh any way</p>

<p>Seeing around corners with a dome mirror. Nice little strategy prop. perhaps it’s viable in deathmatch but I guess seeing a pair of hands going past does not work  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>I think I remember it being said that xen chapters would be expanded upon.</p>
<p>Of course i am ok with the xen turret staying out of black mesa but there is perhaps opportunity for it in it’s original location and in an expanded xen.</p>
<p>But like I said I don’t mind it being cut just trying to give the excuse it needs to be viable. I actually think an alien grunt manning a sentry i.e. func_tank would be just a lot easier and more viable. It would only be a subtle change but still keep somewhat the original sentry.</p>
<p>It saves all the coding and does the same thing almost.</p>

<p>Probably not. It was a matter of a new game play mechanic and then need to code it and work out the special effects then trouble shoot it. It takes a lot of time. Not to mention a good organic texture. Not enough return for the work. They weren’t used anywhere else in the game.</p>

<p>Thanks for changing it. I did consider making a AED but decided not to. The Xen canon/ turret thing was modeled but never textured. There was only one place it was used and it was right at the end.</p>

            <p>Glad that has been sorted out.</p>
<p>I work a lot in large public spaces so i have a couple of infrastructure prop suggestions</p>
<p>Fire alarms with the break glass and fire hoses. I think there may be a fire hose in office complex but what i have been thinking is a sunken fire hose that would be flush with the wall behind a glass or perspex panel.</p>
<p>RCD circuit breakers for the electrics</p>
<p>Wireless routers would also be nice along with the odd mobile phone you could throw at the wall</p>
<p>Also the ground sentry turret is there anyway to bring back the spinning turret death animation?</p>
<p>Shame about the xen turret.</p>
<p>My last idea today instead of nik nak crisps can we have a pack of nit pick crisps.</p>

            <p>Suggest all you want…better yet learn to do it yourself it’s not hard. Also please change the thread name to something like suggestions for prop models or better yet Ronstars model suggestion thread. It’s too close to my other thread name it could confuse people.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s that, there’s just people that have their own ideas and opinions on what would be cool, and would like to see them in action.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I think brian is doing a good job. I have given him feedback and well i thought i would make this prop thread. i actually think the alien sentry could fall under an npc if it is not manned.</p>
<p>But i think it is a good thing it gof brought up.</p>
<p>I am not critiscing or being nitpicky. I just thought it would be a good thing for him to see what ideas people get after seeing what he is doing as you cannot post in the thread</p>

            <p>How about this: Give him your warranted feedback on the models he shows in their appropriate threads (and if you don’t have anything to say about them, don’t post), and let him and the rest of the devs take care of the specifics of what gets made into models. This whole threads seems pointless, especially since it’s so far listed off a tiny prop detail that no one but Ronster would notice and a larger thing that could easily have been put into the less needlessly restrictive <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=16298" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">suggestions thread.</a></p>
<p>Man, and I thought people were nitpicky before release…</p>
