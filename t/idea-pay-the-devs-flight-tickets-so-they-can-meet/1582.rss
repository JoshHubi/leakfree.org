    <title>Idea - Pay the Devs flight tickets so they can meet</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/idea-pay-the-devs-flight-tickets-so-they-can-meet/1582</link>
    <description>As you might have heard, the Steam community generated enough cash for Gabe Newell to fly half way around the world and back in just under 48 hours.

Since this mod is free, the Devs won&#39;t be getting any financial reward for it, but what if we, the community around this mod, collected enough money for them to be flown together at one place, where they could meet face to face for one huge drinking party (or whatever they like), AFTER the mod is released?

Question to Devs: Would you accept such &quot;reward&quot; from the community?
Question to community: How much $ would you send?

(before anyone jumps me: I am unable to act as the &quot;collector&quot;. It would have to be organized by someone else. I&#39;m merely suggesting this idea.)</description>

<p>So? There are 9.000 pronounced supporters of the mod.<br>
Let’s suppose, in the worst case scenario, that you need 1.000 $ x 50 people for this action.</p>
<p>It still only means like 6 dollars per pronounced supporter.</p>

Like I’m going to give these devs any money.</p>
<p>PS, they wouldn’t be accepting money on behalf of the mod, they would be accepting money for plane tickets, which is completely legal.</p>

            <p>I would feel so bad and guilty to play this mod without giving them any reward. They really deserve it. They wasted the most of their freetime and ruined their social life for about 5 years. And they get… Nothing? They sure get the satisfaction of having accomplished such a great project and have the admiration of many people, but that’s not enough. They DO deserve money… REALLY! OH GOD.</p>

            <p>This is so stupid. I’ve heard about other cases like this were money has shifted hands and it has come under scrutiny. It’s gone too far. Nowadays people are afraid to even accept small gratitudes.</p>
<p>Obviously we are not paying for the mod. The cost of arranging such a meeting doesn’t amount to imaginary development costs if it was developed as a commercial game at all.</p>

            <p>This is assuming they want to… or they’re even capable of meeting with their schedules/families/lives… but if they are, and indeed do want to, I’m in support.</p>

<p>As you might have heard, the Steam community generated enough cash for Gabe Newell to fly half way around the world and back in just under 48 hours.</p>
<p>Since this mod is free, the Devs won’t be getting any financial reward for it, but what if we, the community around this mod, collected enough money for them to be flown together at one place, where they could meet face to face for one huge drinking party (or whatever they like), AFTER the mod is released?</p>
<p>Question to Devs: Would you accept such “reward” from the community?<br>
Question to community: How much $ would you send?</p>
<p>(before anyone jumps me: I am unable to act as the “collector”. It would have to be organized by someone else. I’m merely suggesting this idea.)</p>

<p>That’d be great.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Of course, it’s if they wanted to. All I can say is, if they do, be sure to post pics.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Hey, I’d throw in some cash.</p>
