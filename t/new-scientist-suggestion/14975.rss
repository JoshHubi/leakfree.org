    <description>I was thinking that would be cool if Crowbar Collective added the scientist on Kleiner&#39;s portrait from Half-Life 2 to the game, spawning alongside with the ones we already have (or replacing some). Preferably the short female and the Einstein looking guy, there can&#39;t be a science themed enviroment without the Einstein scientist, not to mention that was one of the most memorables NPCs from Half-Life 1 (at least for me) and having him back will make the experience more &quot;faithfull&quot; to the original game. Also the rest of the scientist will be a cool reference to Half-Life 2 and a chance to enrich the Half-Life canon arc.

[attach=5080,none,476][/attach]

Just a small suggestion and please forgive my bad English.

PS: Don&#39;t know who is the guy on the right. Probably Gman?

            <p>Well i think i was blinded by nostalgia a bit. Looking at them again, i don’t think some of those scientis would look so well on HD. Just look at the Einstein one, it was implemented on the game as a parody or some kind of cartoonish  character, maybe will look retarded on HD and will rest seriousness to the game enviroment or maybe not. It all depends on the 3D artist. Im not sure about this.</p>

            <p>I think part of the inherent humor in the original HL was how completely <span class="bbcode-i">un</span>safe Black Mesa was.  Rivers and pools of radioactive slime, proceeding with the test when the anti-mass spectrometer was sending back wonky readings, morphine injectors everywhere, etc.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Holy fuck, the entirety of Residue Processing</p>

            <p>well we do see science team using welding goggles at what 2 points in the game. So it is safe to assume some use safety gear.</p>

            <p>I actually would have liked to see scientists in hazmat gear (either HEV or other) as well, particularly in areas like Lambda Complex and QE. There’s all these signs advising people to “wear protective equipment”, but nobody ever does.</p>

            <p>I have always thought it’d be cool to see a recreation of those scientists from the picture walking around AM.<br>
It’d require 5 entirely new character models, though, Since those faces (And the height differences) are beyond the limits of the FCS implementation. Maybe if one of the character/organic artists has free time in the future, but I wouldn’t hold my breath on that with so much still being worked on. Xen is almost entirely organic, after all.</p>

            <p>Truthfully hoping to see some hazmat suit scientists on xen, doubt they would give the full team there HEV suits, and we already know from the map overview hammer shots we have that blackmesa has facilities set up.</p>
<p>This is the only place that they would make sense in black mesa though, as unlike oposing force you do not activly see scientists in areas of bio research except questinable ethics which is obviously a low level lab for the xen stuff.</p>
