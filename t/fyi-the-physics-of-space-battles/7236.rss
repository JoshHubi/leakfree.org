<p>And a massless particle… are either photons or gluons (and a third one I can’t remember), and then we’re back to Lasers, which he clearly said were sooo much weaker than “particle beams”.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>This is what I mean, I wouldn’t mind the videos if he presented them in a way that wasn’t so whiny and corrective towards a medium that isn’t supposed to be physically accurate. If all SciFi movies and tv shows had to abide by the rules of known physics phenomena, then the whole genre would be pretty bland and boring. That’s why it’s called science FICTION. Here’s an article that I feel would be a better way to go about a scientific explanation of a clearly fictional medium: <a href="https://www.gamepro.com/article/features/215926/the-real-science-of-starcraft-2/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gamepro.com/article/features/215926/the-real-science-of-starcraft-2/</a></p>

            <p>If movies and games were realistic, they would be like reality. We don’t need movies or games to see reality We need them to show us something we can’t normally see or experience! As long as they stay true to a basic logic and don’t deviate from it, and as long as you don’t get pulled out of your suspension of disbelief, it’s fine!</p>
<p>Arguing over the color of lasers vs. their strength is stupid. Imagine Star Wars without any sound (when viewed from space). Imagine Half-Life with realistic injuries. Or the impossibility of time travel in films that deal with paradoxes (Back to the Future, Terminator).</p>

<p>I think it’s funny that this guy is telling us about how badly physics is understood in some movies, while he can’t even describe what gravity is:</p>
<p>He talks about the “speed” of gravity, while he clearly means “acceleration”. In that respect, the “acceleration” of gravity is not 9.8 m/s but 9.8 m/s^2. The speed of gravity - the speed at which gravitational waves propagate - is the speed of light.</p>
<p>Of course, who cares? But then he’s making a video about mistakes even smaller than that, he should at least make sure his video is accurate. It’s like writing a text about correct spelling, but full of spelling mistakes.</p>

<p>It was never about the precision of the acceleration, rather the units. Acceleration, as a rate if change of Velocity is measured in meters per second, per second, or m/s/s or m/s^2.</p>
<p>Also, terminal velocity, the energy requirement to move such an object from one gravitational field to another and atmospheric friction aside, why would you destroy a planet that you want? You would want to take it with a minimal amount of damage …</p>

</aside>
<p>Then biological warfare would still be preferrable to throwing a rock at it, which would still make a military-style invasion unnecessary. Just spray the planet with anti-humanity-spray and be done with it. Surely an alien civilization capable of interstellar travel would be advanced enough not to exterminate another race one specimen at a time.</p>
<p>I have watched it again. You are right, he names the wrong measurement for acceleration. But he also states that the 9.8 m/s are also increasing “per second”. Which is just what the right measurement (m/s/s) says.</p>
<p>Also: Talking about blowing up an incoming asteroid to prevent the extermination of life on Earth’s surface, he suggested to “find the BIGGEST rock you can … and just drop it”</p>
<p>National Geographic reported on scientists having recalculated the estimated size of the dinosaur killer asteroid as being mere 4 to 6 km across. <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080410-sea-meteorites.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Source</a></p>
<p>Certainly not the BIGGEST rock you can find in our own solar system’s asteroid belt.</p>
<p>What about throwing a rock at Earth that is ten or twelve times as large? Would nuking it still have a life saving effect for us on the planet’s surface? Or could the broken pieces of it still have the size of planetary killers?</p>

<p>Seems fair enough to me. Science Fiction is making predictions of the future based around our current knowledge of science.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, its making <span class="bbcode-b">entertainment</span> about potential technologies that would probably never happen. Massive difference. Thats the fiction part.</p>
<p>Also FYI, FYI mean for your information.</p>

<p>I am sure there are even more ciphers to it. It is lke saying that pi equals pi = 3,14, when actually it equals 3,14159265 and millions of other decimal places.</p>

</aside>
<p>I respect your opinion, even though I do not comprehend how you have come to that conclusion. His intent, as shown in other videos, is to teach people the truth about what is shown as “possible” in science fiction movies. It’s a little bit like Mythbusters. It is educational in a sort of entertaining way, and personally, I like it. That’s why I have linked it here for people to watch. I have learned a lot more about physics through this show than I have ever learned in school.</p>
