    <title>Considering a Gaming Keyboard</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/considering-a-gaming-keyboard/8584</link>
    <description>Hey guise, I recently bought a cheap class gaming mouse($12 but a huge upgrade from my low dpi dell thingamabob) and I&#39;ve decided to get a gaming kb, and to be honest I don&#39;t see much of a difference other than the anti-ghosting and macros. I really like this &quot;SHIFT&quot; series thing, it seems cool that I can change themes and buttons so I guess I&#39;m sold in a way.

Was considering saving my chump change for this one, I was looking for a Battlefield 3 edition, but all I saw was a Razer mouse. Any suggestions, I heard the SHIFTs and Zboards are good, but there are better keyboards.

Edit: nvm I found the BF3 kb, but it&#39;s Razor, I was acually looking for a BF3 SHIFT or Zboard set.</description>

<p>I have a Microsoft Ergonomic 4000, have bought 2 of them so far. Amazing keyboard, and pretty cheap for what you get.</p>

<p>Despite not strictly being a ‘gaming’ keyboard, I’ve often looked at these. I got used to using the last one I tried relatively quickly, and they have plenty of hotkeys etc, and are actually really cheap.</p>
<p>Next board for me probably ;D</p>

            <p>I recently got myself a gaming keyboard, the MS X4. Usually tend to steer clear of Microsoft branded peripherals (not that i have anything agianst MS just usually i find their mice/keyboards to be rather meh) but this one ive really liked. It feels nice while just everyday typing and for a backlight keyboard, is nicely priced. its nothing overly fancy but still great.  I will second some of the previous thoughts, a gaming mouse with extra buttons is a step i would take before getting a keyboard if your simply looking for macros and more convenient buttons, and you can also find some pretty good but nicely priced mice</p>

<p>Hey! I’m running a Cyborg V7 keyboard! This one has touch screen media control keys, pretty neat (when they work). Customizable lighting right from the board, no need for software, and the spacebar, WSAD and arrow keys have a metal finish since you use them the most. Interestingly, for example, you could have all the keys light up green and the WASD keys light up red. Pretty neat options if you’re into that</p>

            <p>Yeah, thanks guys. I figured as much that “gaming” was just a tag to inflate the price, I wasn’t really set on buying a keyboard, just thought that I would see some reactions. I didn’t think there was much of a difference from one kb to the next other than the macros for stuff like MMOs and RTS’s, but even then it seemed kinda useless. I saw the gaming mouse thread and thought “what about gaming keyboards”  and eventually brought myself to post this thread.</p>

<p>Here are some extremely good options if you want a gaming keyboard for a good price. I have experience with these as I have bought them with parts for computers I build for people.</p>

Extremely good build quality. If a “customer” requests a keyboard then I usually get one of these unless he/she wants a specific keyboard. Only one color of back light (red) but it looks subtle and somewhat “intimidating” (if you will). Nice texture on the keys and rest.</p>

I have had one of these for a while now. Colors of back light are red, blue, and mixtures of those two colors (pinks and purples). Good build quality, touchscreen media buttons for volume control. Shortcut buttons that are somewhat useless for gaming and I don’t use them much. Texture on keys is nice but gets dirty easily. Rest is REALLY nice and can be removed if needed.</p>

Very similar to the one above in features. Many would say it is better simply because of the brand (that is all it is… the brand, don’t let anyone tell you other wise). Same color settings as the one above except it doesn’t “snap” to the color but has a wheel that can gradually change it. Whereas the one above has touch buttons that change the color to one of a hand full of preset colors. Good build quality like the rest of them. Nice soft texture very similar to the one above. Rest is kind of awkward in my opinion.</p>

<p>I personally wouldn’t get a Zboard or something similar to it.  It would be much cheaper to just get a quality keyboard than to get a keyboard with a different set of keys sold for each game.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m running with a Cyborg V5, and my only complaint with it is the lack of media playback buttons.  Keep in mind with this keyboard, you may need to break in the space bar since it is prone to sticking.  I did this on mine by just using it, and occasionally removing the space bar and putting it back.  Kinda BS that it happens in the first place, but it’s a nice keyboard once you’ve gotten past that problem.</p>

            <p>If you’re DEADSET on a gaming keyboard, the <a href="https://store.razerzone.com/store/razerusa/en_US/pd/productID.169417800/categoryId.35156900" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Razer Lycosa</a> has all the same features for $25 less.</p>
<p>Also, rubber finished keys. What more could you possibly need?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823109191" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft Sidewinder</a> under similar items is even cheaper still while still having anti-ghosting, per-application macros, and backlighting.</p>
<p>I don’t claim to be a professional when it comes to gaming keyboards, but I’m pretty sure anything over $100 is too much.</p>

            <p>I agree, a gaming keyboard seems pointless to me, whereas a gaming mouse could have more buttons and things like profiles and adjustable DPI and keystroke assignments. The latter is quite useful for me because it allows me to use certain mouse buttons in games that don’t support them.</p>

            <p>I would think a mouse with extra buttons would be more preferable than a “gaming” keyboard. I don’t know what a keyboard could add to make it more gaming friendly (I know there are keyboards that have special features for certain games, but I wouldn’t really label those “gaming”) while a “gaming” mouse would have extra buttons.</p>

            <p>I personally wouldn’t get a Zboard or something similar to it.  It would be much cheaper to just get a quality keyboard than to get a keyboard with a different set of keys sold for each game.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m running with a Cyborg V5, and my only complaint with it is the lack of media playback buttons.  Keep in mind with this keyboard, you may need to break in the space bar since it is prone to sticking.  I did this on mine by just using it, and occasionally removing the space bar and putting it back.  Kinda BS that it happens in the first place, but it’s a nice keyboard once you’ve gotten past that problem.</p>

            <p>Advantages of gaming keyboards pretty much amount to backlighting and macros. There are other nice things you can get on a keyboard, such as mechanical or rubber coated, but I’m not sure how much of this is actually unique to “gaming” keyboards or if labeling a keyboard “gaming” just inflates the price.</p>
<p>Also, don’t buy any gaming keyboard that is of a series based around a game. They are never any different than the normal version of the same keyboard but always cost more. This also applies to mice, mousepads, and other hardware.</p>

            <p>Hey guise, I recently bought a cheap class gaming mouse($12 but a huge upgrade from my low dpi dell thingamabob) and I’ve decided to get a gaming kb, and to be honest I don’t see much of a difference other than the anti-ghosting and macros. I really like this “SHIFT” series thing, it seems cool that I can change themes and buttons so I guess I’m sold in a way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823239019&amp;nm_mc=ExtBanner&amp;cm_mmc=BAC-Criteo--Keyboards--SteelSeries-_-23239019" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823239019&amp;nm_mc=ExtBanner&amp;cm_mmc=BAC-Criteo-<em>-Keyboards-</em>-SteelSeries-_-23239019</a></p>
<p>Was considering saving my chump change for this one, I was looking for a Battlefield 3 edition, but all I saw was a Razer mouse. Any suggestions, I heard the SHIFTs and Zboards are good, but there are better keyboards.</p>
<p>Edit: nvm I found the BF3 kb, but it’s Razor, I was acually looking for a BF3 SHIFT or Zboard set.</p>
