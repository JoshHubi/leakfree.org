    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-mic-same-problem/2560</link>
    <description>For christmas I got a brand new microphone for my computer, I got this as my old mic had lots of noise when I was talking. When I plugged my new mic in, i got the same problem. Is their any reason for this or is it just argos selling shitty mics? 

ps. My old mic was fine for about 5 months, but then turned shitty.</description>
