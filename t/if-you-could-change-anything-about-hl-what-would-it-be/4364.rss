    <description>I&#39;d probably add an inventory system that lets you carry and deploy turrets, so you could set up ambushes. Either that, or get rid of the Ichys, they scare the crap out of me. :fffuuu:</description>

-Giving the player an explication of what happened in the last 20 years, it doesn’t matter to me if it is a 20 minutes cutscene, I just would like people could appreciate Half-Life’s awesome story without having to go to “The Half Life Saga Story Guide” site.</p>

            <p>I wanna add a Headcrab throwing weapon because when you face a Human Grunt on Half Life or Combine Soldier in Half Life 2, You can distract them or (possibly) latching on them which will cause instant death. That sounds pretty awesome but it sounds like the cut weapon from Half Life 2. It kinda sounds like the Snark from Half Life 1 but sounds cool to me…</p>

            <p>You can change the max ammo of any weapon with convars. Just type ‘sk_max_’ and then the weapon name &amp; you can set how much ammo. But really, the amount of ammo is well balanced and shouldn’t really be tampered with.</p>
