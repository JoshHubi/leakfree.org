    <title>Black Mesa Source and speedrunning glitches</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-source-and-speedrunning-glitches/13782</link>
    <description>Before I start this I just want to say,
Please,
[b][i]PLEASE[/size][/i][/b]
don&#39;t fix bunnyhopping.

Now that thats out of the way,
BMS is a wonderful mod, a recreation of the Half-Life 1 experience in source. something that took many people many hours to make
but sadly, no one is perfect and it has glitches, most glitches are source related but some aren&#39;t, some are in fact due to human oversite, things like mapping errors.
As a person who likes to speedrun source games, when I heard about BMS thats  one of the first things I though of. After playing through the game I relised something.
&quot;where the fuck is ABH?&quot;
at first I thought maybe my 2007 Source was broken but sadly, nope BMS had patched ABH
(if you dont know what ABH is its a glitch that involves jumping backwards while  crouching, and not holding A or S, the game does some magic and you start going faster each jump)
It was a real disappointment for me, I then discovered that there was &quot;HL1 bunnyhopping&quot; albeit very slow.
as of speaking the Sourceruns team isnt working on a BMS speedrun, well they ARE but they havent worked on it in over a year, one of the reasons why is because of the slow speed, although due to a recently (past years or so) found glitch they is potential in running BMS.
thats just a little bit of words from me, now on to something else, I feel that the new BM should have [i]some [/i]speedruning related things.
now I understand that things like map clipbrush&#39;s (or the lack of) is something that you kinda have to fix.
but something like ABH or BunnyHopping is a different story
ABH for example is extremely hard to do with out knowledge on it, it may sound simple (see the thing about ABH above) but it took people a few years to find it after the new Half-life 2 orange box updates came out (when it was first introduced)
Bunnyhopping is even harder, unlike ABH, where all you have to do is jump and move left and right if need be, bunny hopping is almost its own game mechanic
you have to strafe left and right and more the mouse in the repective direction, while not going too fast or too slow, it takes time and could almost never be done by accident.
so why did I write out all this text about speedrunning? I feel it should be a slight part of the game.
I feel that you could possibly add things for it, like a custom menu option to allow for a time trial type game mode, whilst keeping in glitches for such a thing.
or cvars to allow for speedruning glitches to be enabled/disabled, so people dont have to be bothered by any accidental glitches that they may come across.
the speedruning community for source is quite large, and I feel it could add a very big part to playing BMS 2.0 or what ever its going to be called.
now im sure people have talked about this before but now that [i]something[/i] is happening with BMS its a good time to address it,
I dont expect you guys to just add it on the spot, but maybe in the future you can consider it as an update.


Well I feel thats all I have to say about this, feel free to ask anything pertaining to this</description>

            <p>I thought the cool part of speedrunning was that you have the game, you find exploits and you use them to finish it as fast as possible.<br>
You don’t just ask devs: “You know, I can’t get the glod here, can you add a wallclip or something?”<br>
You work with what you have.<br>
If they fix stuff, legacy% or new strats are your options.</p>

<p>I guess your right by saying that all speedrunners are on the same level anyway, but by re-adding something like bunnyhopping it makes the level more fun, it adds a challenge to it if you think about it. Say people started speedrunning Black Mesa 2.0.it would be boring to run, because besides the few glitches you could do in a SS or an RTA run, you woulld just be walking from map to map. things like bunnyhopping make it so you have to TRY, it makes it more interesting over all.<br>
also I dont doubt that speedrunners willl not find glitches in BM2.0, but its not enticing enough, because as said earlier you could just be walking from map to map just to do the special glitches with no “meat” in the middle</p>

<p>No. I don’t get why people constantly bitch about this but I get so sick of it. Just like every other game, speedrunners can find new glitches to use, and I’m sure they will. If they’re not willing to take the time to find new glitches then they hardly deserve to be called speedrunners. Can these topics just die already?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>yes, speedruners can find new glitches but source isnt a very glitchy engine, so every glitch patched is like cutting off a limb and trying to climb a mountain.in its own way bunnyhopping isnt even that much of a glitch, its more of a strategy,(its still a glitch I know ) taking more skill and concentration then just playing the game normally, adding a new layer of depth to it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve seen enough Source game speedruns to know that’s bullshit. Most source games are chock-full of glitches for speedrunners, whether it be levitating on physics objects, or flying over entire maps through various means. Black Mesa will undoubtedly have its own glitches that speedrunners will find, and even if there isn’t anything to replace bunnyhopping, who cares? Either way, all speedrunners are still on an even keel as long as they’re playing the same game.</p>

</aside>
<p>nope, not the same guy</p>
<p>also bunnyhopping <em>was</em> in the game, you couldnt go very fast without a boost but it was there.<br>
The devs can fix it, the only thing they would have to do is remove the like 4 lines of code that checks your speed every jump and just add a CVAR for enabling or disabling it</p>

            <p>They’ve addressed bunnyhopping several times before, mainly in the MP discussion thread.</p>
<p>Since Valve hates bhopping and has tried repeatedly to fix it at an engine level, it’s most likely not possible in retail BM. The devs aren’t interested in supporting it, and likely don’t have the time or resources to do so, either.</p>
