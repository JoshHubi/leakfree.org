    <title>Combine Code Words</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/combine-code-words/777</link>
    <description>I love the convoluted codes that the Combine use. After listening closely to Overwatch and Combine Soldier dialogue, as well as examining &quot;sentences.txt&quot;, I&#39;ve been able to generate a list of the probable definitions of most of the Combine code words for things:

[b]Code : Definition / Rebel Term[/b]

Anticitizen 1 : Gordon Freeman
Airwatch : Scanner Network / Air Units
Biotic : Antlion (Could possibly also refer to other Xen creatures.)
Bodypack : Armour
Boomer : Gunship (?)
Bouncer : Enemy Grenade (Zombines use this for their own grenades.)
Cauterize : Cut Off
Containment Field : Shield
Control Section : Citadel
Dislocate : Remove
Displace : Retreat
Deserviced / Duty Vacated : Dead (Used for friendlies)
Exogen : (Usually used to refer to Antlions, but also occasionally to other hazards such as reprogrammed Sentry Turrets and Rollermines.)
Expunge : Kill
Extractor : Friendly Grenade
Flare : Grenade (In general)
Ghost 2 : Gordon Freeman
Interpose : Cover
Lock : Stand Ground
Hard-Point : Mounted Gun Emplacement / Bunker
Hurricane : Key Resistance Figure (Not Gordon. Used to define status of &quot;outbreak&quot;)
Necrotic : Zombie
Noncitizen : Rebel
Outbreak : Human Revolt (When said three times in short succession, means that the speaker is overwhelmed.)
Parasite / Parasitic: Headcrab
Phantom : Gordon Freeman
Political Conscript : Stalker (?)
Priority 1 Objective / Primary Target : Gordon Freeman
Probe : Investigate
Prosecute : Assault
Restrictor : Thumper
Ripcord : Retreat
Signature Imprint : Data Packet (Presumably)
Sterilizer : Sentry Turret
Storm System : Canal
Tag : Kill
Target 1 : Gordon Freeman
Transport : Teleporter
Universal Union : Combine
Vance Prime : Eli Vance (Presumably)
Vance Sub-Prime : Alyx Vance
Viscon : Enemy Sighted
Verdict : Bullet
Virome : Antlion
Viscerator : Manhack
Workforce Intake Hub : Trainstation
10-99 : Overrun
10-108 : Friendly Dead / Death
404 : Riot

I may have missed a few, and of course some are speculation, but I&#39;ve tried to determine the best definitions when taking into account where they are used, etc. Your thoughts?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Political conscript refers to Stalkers due to the context. “Attention Nova Prospekt internal containment teams. De-service all political conscripts in block A7. Prohibit external contact.” (fprison_deservicepoliticalconscripts.wav)</p>
<p>Conscripts might also refer to metrocops, but I can’t tell from the file alone. (citizensummoned.wav) “Reporting citizen summoned to voluntary conscription for general public service detail T94-322” With that combine newspeak, it could mean that they voluntary rebelled, and thus agreed to becoming stalkers. Or something along those lines.</p>

            <p>I think political conscript is supposed to mean wallace breen.<br>
Although I think in the HL2 beta conscripts were something like metrocops.<br>
Anyways, nice list.</p>

            <p>I’ve been trying to transcribe the combine speech sound files, so they’d be easier to understand, but the files with the prison_soldier_ prefix are to fast, long. I was actually bored enough yesterday to do all of them with only a few real complete blanks.</p>

            <aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<pre><code> I always thought that these were either the Overwatch phonetic alphabet or if they were procedural instructions issued to Combine forces.
</code></pre>
<p>In any case if I can nitpick…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Of course! That’s what this thread is really for, to discuss different interpretations of what they say.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Anticitizen 1 isn’t specific to Gordon Freeman, it’s a level of citizen status, kind of like saying “the most wanted” though surely Gordon is the only person to have ever attained it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Since he’s who they’re referring to when they say it, it makes sense to define it as him, but you’re right, there is more to it than that.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Airwatch I believe refers to Combine Gunships and Helicopters rather than scanners… Scanners are apparently automated, so I don’t think they would take instruction through announcements.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know, I haven’t heard any announcements that are directly giving orders to the Airwatch. The only references I’ve found to the Airwatch is giving ground units updates as to what it has found or is doing.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Biotics (in Episode 2 refer specifically to Gordon and Alyx) seems to refer to human/earth lifeforms.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Possibly, but it is said in an area that contains an Antlion hive. This leads me to think that it is referring to them, rather that Alyx or Gordon, especially as you hear a soldier on the radio in Nova Prospekt talking about how “Primary Target is engaged in command and control tactics with Biotics”.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Containment Field means the Combine forcefields that do not permit non-combine organisms to pass through.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s pretty much what I meant by “shield”. Although it could also refer to the ones that let authorized citizens pass through, that you see in the beginning.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Control Section sounds more as if it refers to a district/designated sector of City 17.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s definitely the Citadel, or at least a description of it. “sentences.txt” gives a list of places, used for metropolice radio chatter (e.g. when they die), an extract of which:</p>
<p>// map 8 citadel<br>
V_G1_LOCATION_MAP08P0 highpriorityregion<br>
V_G1_LOCATION_MAP08P1 terminalrestrictionzone<br>
V_G1_LOCATION_MAP08P2 controlsection[/SIZE]</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Exogen specifically refers to Antlions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You can sometimes hear soldiers say “Visual on exogens.” when they see reprogrammed sentry turrets. Of course, this may be an error on the developer’s part.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway… bouncer and boomer don’t sound like Combine dialogue… but perhaps refer to hopper mines and thumpers? I sincerely doubt boomer refers to gunships.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Bouncer definitely means grenades, but Boomer is a bit more speculative. Thumpers are definitely called Restrictors, so I doubt it could be them. My definition is derived from a soldier radio transmission (filename “prison_soldier_boomersinbound.wav”) that you hear in the final bunker before climbing up to Nova Prospekt, which says something that sounds very like “Overwatch confirms double boomers dispatched, inbound. Coast drop inbound. Prepare for special heavy suppression and wrap 'em.”</p>
<p>Since you meet a pair of Gunships very shortly after that, this leads me to believe that the “boomers” that the soldier was talking about were Gunships. And they do make sort of boomey noises.</p>

            <p>Thanks dude, i will use this on my mod when i know how to mod.XD(No, but really)</p>
<p>And i think every combine is it own code like “C17-3-4” C17 is mean from City 17, from team 3 combine soldier 4, This just my own theory, don’t get too drag away by these.</p>
<p>I hear combine soldier say "Outbreak"x3 when i spawn 4-6 combine soldier in ravenholm for fun, i laugh out when i saw the last combine soldier say “Outbreak!Outbreak!Outbreak!” before mow down by zombies.</p>

<p>Anyway… bouncer and boomer don’t sound like Combine dialogue… but perhaps refer to hopper mines and thumpers? I sincerely doubt boomer refers to gunships.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know about boomer myself, but I was replaying HL2 yesterday, and I heard a Combine soldier clearly yell “Bouncer!” as he was running from a grenade I tossed at him, so Bouncer does indeed seem to at least refer to enemy grenades.</p>
<p>I haven’t heard Boomer used ingame (Though I might have just not understood the soldier or just wasn’t paying attention), but it would make sense if it referred to hopper mines or thumpers.</p>

            <p>I always thought that these were either the Overwatch phonetic alphabet or if they were procedural instructions issued to Combine forces.</p>
<p>In any case if I can nitpick…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Anticitizen 1</span> isn’t specific to Gordon Freeman, it’s a level of citizen status, kind of like saying “the most wanted” though surely Gordon is the only person to have ever attained it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Airwatch</span> I believe refers to Combine Gunships and Helicopters rather than scanners… Scanners are apparently automated, so I don’t think they would take instruction through announcements.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Biotics</span> (in Episode 2 refer specifically to Gordon and Alyx) seems to refer to human/earth lifeforms.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Containment Field</span> means the Combine forcefields that do not permit non-combine organisms to pass through.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Control Section</span> sounds more as if it refers to a district/designated sector of City 17.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Exogen</span> specifically refers to Antlions.</p>
<p>Anyway… bouncer and boomer don’t sound like Combine dialogue… but perhaps refer to hopper mines and thumpers? I sincerely doubt boomer refers to gunships.</p>

<p>Cool idea, but I’ve never attributed subtlety to the combine.<br>
The closest thing to a combine spy was Judith Mossman who turned out to be a double agent.</p>
<p>I’ve never under stood much of the combine radio chatter, Normally i’m more worried about my health bar or theirs.  But I’ve always been interested in what I consider is missed dialogue.</p>

            <p>“Attention. Rank leaders. Reminder: one hundred sterilized credits qualifies non-mechanical reproduction simulation.”</p>
<p>Other notable comments by the Overwatch Dispatcher are “Premature mission termination will result in fifty percent reproduction credits.” and “Memory replacement is the first step towards rank privileges.”</p>
<p>Moreover, when a metrocop kills you, you sometimes hear her say “Reward Notice: Protection Team member, your family cohesion is preserved.” So as well as rewarding brutality with non-mechanical reproduction simulations, they also allow them to stay with their loved ones.</p>

            <p>in Red Letter Day when you are being chased by the Metrocops you can hear the PA system say “Remember: Good work results in the privilige of non-mechanical reproduction simulation.”</p>
<p>So yes, they are bribing the officers with simu-sex if they kill gordon freeman.</p>

            <p>Good find man. A lot of interesting information in there that I hadn’t checked or seen before. That’s not the complete phonetic alphabet that’s available though, as victor and x-ray of the existing NATO one are both missing. I’m most intrigued by the air support names.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>// air support names:</p>
<p>V_RNDNAMES0 ghost {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES1 reaper {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES2 nomad {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES3 hurricane {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES4 phantom {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES5 judge {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES6 shadow {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES7 slam {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES8 stinger {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES9 storm {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES10 vamp {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES11 winder {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDNAMES12 star {Len 0.4}</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ghost and phantom already refer to Freeman, so I’m wondering what the rest refer to? All air support units? So that would include scanners, synths scanners, manhacks, hunter choppers and gunships I would guess. I had no idea they put so much thought into the game. I had just assumed that the soldiers’ speech was meant to be unintelligible.</p>

            <p>Interesting: sentences.txt (located in source engine.gcf/scripts, in case anyone else wants to check it out) does give a partial phonetic alphabet list:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>//phonetic alphabet/codes:<br>
V_RNDCODES0 apex {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES1 ion {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES2 jet {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES3 kilo {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES4 mace {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES5 nova {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES6 payback {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES7 sundown {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES8 uniform {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES9 boomer {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES10 echo {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES11 flatline {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES12 helix {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES13 ice {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES14 quicksand {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES15 payback {Len 0.4}<br>
V_RNDCODES16 ripcord {Len 0.4}</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A lot of the other words you used refer to squad names for soldiers or Civil Protection officer. The more violent ones tend to be soldiers, whereas Civil Protection has names like “defender”, “hero” and “union”.</p>
