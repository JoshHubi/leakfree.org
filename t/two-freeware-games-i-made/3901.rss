    <title>Two Freeware Games I made.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/two-freeware-games-i-made/3901</link>
    <description>Since this is to show off our creations I thought I share two freeware games I made... 

It is a puzzle game where you have to align bombs and rockets to cause a chain reaction of explosions.

...and, well, I of course provide some statements from other players (hence the show off):

[i][COLOR=&#39;DarkOrange&#39;]&quot;...it is so god damn professionally made!&quot;

&quot;I love this game ! It&#39;s great ! Good Picture , amazing art ,very awesome game.&quot;

&quot;really nice game, near perfection.&quot;

&quot;I like the music...&quot;

&quot;Lovely, lovely game!&quot;

&quot;The style is just right. I enjoy the characters presented.&quot;

&quot;This game is magnificent! I love puzzle games and this one is just great... &quot;

&quot;The graphics are spot on, the sound effects are perfect and the gameplay is entertaining... &quot;

&quot;The gameplay is really intuitive - you know what to do immediately.&quot;

&quot;I particularly like the change of pace introduced by the forest level!&quot;[/i]

Attention:
It is made for a competition and might be playable on the PSP soon. That&#39;w why it has such a low resolution (You can go fullscreen though) and navigation and everything is done with the cursor-keys and space/or STRG.

Download it here (Win only):

I will post the other game later. Sun is shining and I want to go outside first.</description>

<p>Ok so he made a game about tits, There are people who make websites with tits all over them, but i bet you visit them all the time, so stop your complaining about a tittie game…</p>
<p>On the other hand, Im perfect and don’t go to those sites, so i can critique about the boob game, and i onlies got one question; why waste your time with something like that when your probably capable of programming something 10x better… or something, i dunno -.-</p>

<p>If I made a game about wallpaper that was really functional, had photo-realistic graphics, I wouldn’t expect anyone to congratulate me. I’d expect the same if I made some game about tits for pubescent boys. Doesn’t matter if it’s coded really well, it doesn’t stop it being pathetic.</p>

<p>Like the OP said though, he makes bank so it’s not even really worth debating, anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are several gaming magazines in Germany. Each with a different tone. One magazine is targetted at 13 year old males. The Jokes in the magazines are everywhere and in almost every articele, politically incorrect,  and often oriented towards sexual themes.<br>
So it was a no brainer to get <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">free advertising</span></span> by making this theme to get to the cover disk.</p>
<p>12 Games are in planning, each with a different theme, look and feel. One for example (next one, tbh) picks up the B-Movie theme, one will be totally retro, one will be a lot like Myst, etc…</p>
<p>And -of course- I also need a few people being offended.</p>
<p>And soup and his comments are just a perfect example how well the plan works out.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  So easy and predictable (I also am a teacher for programming and game-design and of course touch topics of how to rise attention too).</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Another experiment I did was the following: I put both games on a freeware-gaming-site. IMHO Bomb Squad is the much better game. But guess what game got 10 times the downloads of the other.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>But to calm down Soup a little: The next game’s working title is “They Came from the Grave” which jumps the Zombie-Game-Hype-Bandwagon but in which you cannot shoot at the Zombies and goes for gameplay innovation.</p>

<p>The reward motivation is tits. How is that any better or worse than a game that motivates you with better gear, a one-two minute FMV, or nothing at all? Except that it’s something that would draw a larger audience than most games. I didn’t realize that there was a line in the sand that nudity is on the wrong side of but every other lame-ass reward isn’t.</p>
<p>Do you also snob-out on movies like Van Wilder, White Castle, Pineapple Express, etc because they’re “only about sex and getting high”?</p>
<p>Like the OP said though, he makes bank so it’s not even really worth debating, anyway.</p>

            <p>Good god, it’s not about the script, or “how epic and deep the story basis is”. It’s about how it’s a game about <span class="bbcode-i">tits.</span> That is the entire basis of the game. However well made it is, that doesn’t hide the fact that it is a game about <span class="bbcode-i">tits.</span></p>

<p>If I made a game about wallpaper that was really functional, had photo-realistic graphics, I wouldn’t expect anyone to congratulate me. I’d expect the same if I made some game about tits for pubescent boys. Doesn’t matter if it’s coded really well, it doesn’t stop it being pathetic.</p>

<p>He was showing off a game he made, not a story or script he wrote. If you want to judge content based on how epic and deep the story basis is, then go ahead but don’t expect to look like anything but a jackass when you do so with someone who is not a writer. It would be tantamount to telling the author of an academic paper that his formatting is unsatisfactory and therefore the paper is not good. As true as you may be, you’re still missing the point.</p>
<p>A meaningful criticism in this case would be related to the architecture of the game. Playability, responsiveness, size, or even the game logic…  but the raster art? Seriously?</p>

<p>Not yet. But I hope it can be ported soon without changing the source too much.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a Pac Man clone to as freeware to bring an old and very unknown Pac Man variant to todays gamers, I am in the concept phase of a commercial game (self funded and published) and have to produce one webgame per month for a client. So I have not the time to port this stuff now.</p>
