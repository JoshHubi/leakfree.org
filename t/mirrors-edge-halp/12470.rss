    <title>Mirror&#39;s Edge - Halp!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mirrors-edge-halp/12470</link>
    <description>Egad.  I just started playing Mirror&#39;s Edge today and was going through the tutorial and got stuck almost right away.  I cannot progress.

It&#39;s the part where you are supposed to do a wall jump, turn 180 degrees and then grab onto the ledge.  I have tried over a hundred times to do this and fail every time.

What am I doing wrong?  Is there a trick to this? Quite frustrated right now.</description>

            <p>Okay, I was able to do it; had to change the key bindings because evidently I wasn’t able get my fingers moving fast enough otherwise.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for the assistance.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>The key is Q, I believe.</p>
<p>Luckily, I don’t think you have to actually use that move in the game more than once or twice, though there was one section with a ton of scaffolding inside a building that I only beat because the checkpoint system glitched out.</p>
<p>Now, the wallrun cross-jump? THAT move will make you pull your hair out.</p>

            <p>There’s a key that does a 180 turn. You’re not supposed to do it with your mouse if that’s what you’re trying to do.</p>
