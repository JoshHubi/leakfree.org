    <description>I was thinking about why would people like HL2, and why.
With me, that was the GREAT story, and when i played HL2, i could not wait to go on, and why? i don&#39;t know!:lambda:</description>

<p>The thing that bugged me about the ps2 version was it often had this ugly full-bright looking lighting in places. I did like their odd attempt at facial animations though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I wanted to use the Gluon Gun with better graphics, and physics. I was very disappointed until I heard of this mod. I love that shiny blue beam of death.</p>

<p>I don’t think it was Source, they didn’t have ragdolls or the improved water effects. The graphics in the PS2 version were much better than in the PC version (even if you have the HD pack).</p>

            <p>I was bored out of my mind, then i decided to look for games.  In my mom’s boyfriend’s (ya I was like in the 6th grade when i played HL)game collection I found Half-Life Anthology and thought this was pretty cool looking.  It was the first fps i completed  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .

            <p>I liked how well Valve had Half-Life’s story slowly unravel itself without cutscenes just scripted events. By the end of the game, If you payed attention, you know just as much What the Hell happened as Gordon.<br>
Years later I see in a game magazine that Half-Life 2 is coming out! I read the page(they screwed up and said Alyx was gordon’s daughter lol), waited for  a trailer, and thought the graphics looked way too cool for a game being released in 2004. I saved up money, got the game, and It’s that same, you’re in the game WTF is going on, feeling from the first one.</p>
<p>Overall I think it’s the style of play and the incredible storyline.</p>

            <p>The E3-Trailer made me play Half-Life 2. At that time it was just undescribable awesome and stunning. I saw the trailer and just HAD to play that game.

            <p>I played all the classic Half Lifes (Blue Shift, Opposing Force…) and I loved them all. I loved the story, and it was generally a fun game. Although to me, the environment got a little monotonous (that’s just me). I remember how long I waited for HL2 to come out, and man! I also wanted to play it because I saw the CP with the masks and stunsticks on the advertisements, and thought to myself, <span class="bbcode-i">what’s this?</span> I just wanted to complete the story and have some more fun. <span class="bbcode-b">COME ON FUCKING EP3! I’M WAITING!</span></p>
