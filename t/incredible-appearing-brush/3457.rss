    <title>Incredible Appearing Brush</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/incredible-appearing-brush/3457</link>
    <description>Essentially whats happening here is a block is magically appearing when I compile my map, and I have no clue where it is coming from.

Here is the hammer view:

And the in game view:

Any help or just information on what that is would be great.</description>

            <p>Okay, double posting but its been long enough.</p>
<p>I’ve tried deleting specific brushes but it only goes away if I delete the entire building, and all the brushes in it, so essentially I’m stuck with just redoing it. Oh well.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay, just found the problem. Evidently there was an invisible brush inside one of my other brushes that was somehow too small despite being larger than some other brushes. Still don’t know why it worked elsewhere. Anyway, problem solved.</p>

            <p>Just retexture brushes until you find which one is getting randomly stretched.</p>

            <p>Okay, If I delete that entire area of the map it goes away, but after deleting each individual piece of complex entities, it won’t, so I get to go error hunting. Yay!</p>

            <p>Not entirely sure, whenever I got it I always deleted the brush and started over again. Either try the “Check for problems” button, or make it into a func_detail.</p>

            <p>I would never commit such blasphemy. How do you get rid of it if it is too much complex geometry because I’ve deleted all the complex geometry I have and its still there.</p>

            <p>I’ve had this problem before, usually caused by having brushes with a lot of complex geometry tied to an entity.</p>
<p>Either that or you used carve :fffuuu:</p>
