    <title>Physics Problem in Opening Tram</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/physics-problem-in-opening-tram/9709</link>
    <description>When you jump while on the tram ride during the intro, the tram continues to move forward and you do not so it seems as though you are jumping forward/backward. Gordon should just jump &quot;in place&quot; because he is moving forward at the same rate as the tram.

I have a feeling that this is a problem with Valve&#39;s engine since it most likely handles the physics but I figured I&#39;d bring it up.

EDIT: No getpos or status messages.

TO REPLICATE: Replay the opening tram ride. While the tram is moving forward, jump. The tram will continue to move forward while Gordon is in the air.</description>
