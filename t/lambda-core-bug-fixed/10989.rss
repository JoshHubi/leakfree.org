    <title>Lambda Core bug [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lambda-core-bug-fixed/10989</link>
    <description>When I enter pump station 02 in chapter Lambda Core - (loading). There I kill all monsters that appear there, but from some reason I want to go back so I go back and we have loading again, right after the loading I can hear the sound of unlock, I go to tank aux and door warning light shines green. I think that it&#39;s caused by trigger or script which triggers in moment when I&#39;m coming back because it assumes that I&#39;ve already turned the pump 02 on, what&#39;s not truth of course, so because of this bug it is possible to completely skip 01 and 02, and just go on straightly to the reactor, so the challenge is missing then, it&#39;d be really good if you would fix this, otherwise I don&#39;t know about anything else, only at the very end, that big teleport, so when I was looking right at those effects and particles, I had pretty huge FPS drops. But I realize that this is barely fixable, focus on that pump station 01 and 02 bug mainly.
I told to one of my friends to try that thing with pump station 01 and 02, and he could skip it as well, and he had those FPS drops at the very end too, but it&#39;s true that we both have little slower computers, as I said focus mainly on that pump station 01 and 02 bug, thanks.
PS: Mod is awesome, and I&#39;m looking forward to Xen!</description>
