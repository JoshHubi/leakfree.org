    <description>Has anyone here ever played Afraid of Monsters? It was a small little SP mod for Half-Life that was good at being fucking scary while screwing with your head. Heres the MODDB page for the directors cut:

Anyways, the guy who made this has been working on another mod, called Cry of Fear. It uses a modified version of the GoldSource Paranoia engine...meaning that you&#39;re still playing a Half Life mod but with visuals that don&#39;t shit all over your eyeballs. 

Some screenshots:

Crazy blur over-dose effect:

Here&#39;s an old video that was WIP, but I like it because it gives you a sense of how ominous the atmosphere could be:

And heres a MODDB guy reviewing a private demo that he play tested. He basically says that it&#39;s scary to the point of almost being unfair, and that it plays like its own retail game instead of your average HL mod:

So yeah, I have been following this mod for a while. Besides BMS, this is my other most anticipated mod...

Any thoughts? Do you guys think it looks as kick ass as I do? :fffuuu::fffuuu:</description>

<p>I found nightmare house to be enjoyable but not really scary at all. Theres only so much you can do with the stock headcrab zombies as the main enemy. Afraid of monsters was a lot more unsettling for me.</p>

            <p>Nightmare House Remake is pretty scary, but it’s more haunted house cheap scares than AoM. If you do get AoM, get the directors cut version. It’s basically an updated version of the original with better textures, models, sounds and stuff like that. It’s also more of a psychological horror, one that you should play late at night with the lights off and headphones up for maximum pants shitting.</p>

            <p>I’ve been following this mod for a while and I am also very interested in it. First day download for me, I check their ModDB profile regularly for updates. Also, I don’t think its fair to call it a ‘mod’ anymore. The level of work and custom content that’s gone into this should qualify it as its own game, since it doesn’t resemble HL in the slightest. I love the music too, especially the track “Watercorridor”, so eerie and atmospheric. If the quality of their work based off the current media and AoM is anything to go off, this game is going to rock.</p>

            <p>Minuit and Rumpel have worked wonders on the goldsrc engine.  It looks amaaaaaazing.  They even went the extra length to give it an active menu like in Half-Life 2.  Occasional the gldsrc-i-ness shines through, in an oddly square circle or two, but other than that, it looks effing amazing.</p>

            <p>Really? It’s not showing up in the steam games list?</p>
<p>I still really like the review of the demo, gives you the impression of how scary and hard this game is supposed to be.</p>
<p>“I quit. At that moment is when I stopped playing the game. Nothing physically scared me, but I quit playing. I didn’t want to go down in that tunnel. Nothing in my life has ever done that to me in a video game. I looked down that tunnel, and I just literally said, ‘fuck this’”.</p>

            <p>It’s using a modified version of the goldsource engine, allowing for higher resolution textures and improved shaders. Even the water is rendered similarly to the source engine, with all the reflections and whatnot. So no more poopy butthole static HL water. :3</p>
<p>But it’s still goldsource. All you will need is a copy of Half-Life on steam to play it…apparently it does not play nice with the WON version of HL.</p>

            <p>Well in afraid of monsters the zombies jerked around unnaturally and came at you in a quick, eerie way. I have a real life friend who absolutely refused to continue playing after shutting off the power in the hospital when the music started to play (and he had no problems playing Doom 3 or FEAR in the dark). So I can’t guarentee that you’ll find it scary, but I found it pretty unnerving at times.</p>

            <p>Has anyone here ever played Afraid of Monsters? It was a small little SP mod for Half-Life that was good at being fucking scary while screwing with your head. Heres the MODDB page for the directors cut:</p>

<p>Anyways, the guy who made this has been working on another mod, called Cry of Fear. It uses a modified version of the GoldSource Paranoia engine…meaning that you’re still playing a Half Life mod but with visuals that don’t shit all over your eyeballs.</p>
<p>Some screenshots:</p>

<p>Here’s an old video that was WIP, but I like it because it gives you a sense of how ominous the atmosphere could be:</p>

<p>And heres a MODDB guy reviewing a private demo that he play tested. He basically says that it’s scary to the point of almost being unfair, and that it plays like its own retail game instead of your average HL mod:</p>

<p>So yeah, I have been following this mod for a while. Besides BMS, this is my other most anticipated mod…</p>
<p>Any thoughts? Do you guys think it looks as kick ass as I do? :fffuuu::fffuuu:</p>
