Ubisoft released this on their Facebook page today.  It&#39;s confirmed that the game will feature a pirate protagonist (who&#39;s hopefully pops a little more than Connor) and a more nautical setting.

Thoughts on this very sudden and unexpected announcement?</description>

            <p>I agree with your last point.  I think a greater degree of freedom would go a long way, with harsher penalties or rewards for going about assassinations certain ways.</p>
<p>Also, taking the focus back to actual assassinations would be awesome, kthxbye</p>

</aside>
<p>And that’s exactly what I think is wrong with the series. There are many good things about them - exciting and detailed worlds, good characters, dialogue etc - but the gameplay is not one of them for me.</p>
<p>I’ve watched the series turn from open-ended, tense missions where the player is vulnerable to rigid, linear, highly scripted events where the player is a walking tank. I like to be challenged in games and be rewarded for it - instead the AC series has made combat laughably easy but stealth and missions teeth-grittingly frustrating to complete flawlessly.</p>
<p>My point was that the original, and to an extent AC2, fit in with people’s idea about what it was to be an assassin. Now it’s something different. The first AC’s assassination missions were vicious and tense, with several ways to complete them. Now I’m penalised if I don’t complete the assassinations in <span class="bbcode-i">exactly the right way</span> and given a very linear path in which to do it. Where is the freedom in that?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ll have to stop you right there.</p>
<p>The last time AC centered around stealth was the first game…some of the time.  In AC2 you get a hand cannon, fly across Venice on a glider acquiring lift from large bonfires on the ground below, and beat the pope to a bloody pulp after an extended battle with papal guards.</p>
<p>Brotherhood opened with you shooting canons at invading Templars and introduced chain kills to facilitate your status as a one-man army.  Oh yeah, and you single-handedly assault and destroy Templar war machines.  Hell, you even hijack a Renaissance era tank and use it to shoot hellfire at your enemies.</p>
<p>Revelations.  Bombs.  Destroying light houses.  Chariots.  Parasailing <span class="bbcode-i">behind</span> a chariot.  Setting fire to Cappadocia in an explosive conflagration.</p>
<p>And AC3 made you nigh unstoppable with any weapon you used, allowed you to have up to four pistol shots ready to go at a time, introduced naval battles, had you participate in the most publicized and conspicuous events of the American Revolution (including the Boston Massacre and Tea Party), etc.</p>
<p>Criticizing this game for its lack of stealth is silly; this series was never about stealth.  It was about laying low in crowds before initiating explosive action sequences.  And based on the gameplay, that’s still what it’s about.</p>

<p>Of all of them the gameplay was the worst, and this was a game that used to be all about stealth.</p>
<p>I get they have to cram as much in as possible in these presentations, but it genuinely seems like all that once made Assassin’s Creed great has gone. Now it’s just endless killing and blowing things up - the piracy is just the vehicle to make all that seem more plausible.</p>
<p>I think I’ll be getting Watch Dogs instead - it honestly seems like the spiritual successor to AC and it does stealth, combat and free running better in every respect.</p>

            <p>Wow, so Ubisoft  realized Connor was a dead fish over a year before AC3 was released.</p>

<p>Ubisoft Mountreal has always been the game’s industry’s house for animation porn. Their saga of great animations goes back to Sands of Time (The titular Prince had 1100+ animations when most characters at the time had &lt;100)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s a huge reason why I enjoy Ubisoft’s games so much. The animations make every movement feel fresh, even after playing it so many times. I dunno why, but seeing the same animations doing the same things tends to get on my nerves in games after a while.</p>

            <p>Graphically, no.  But that lighting looks spiffy.  And, what I was mostly stunned by, the AWESOME ANIMATION!  He looks so fluid and fierce.  See how he strikes?  It looks really organic, not stiff like most animation you see.</p>

            <p>This looks next gen to you Winged? Doesn’t look too much different to say ACIII to me. I’ll have to watch the trailer again.</p>
<p>I would prefer a brand new pirate game instead of Assassin’s Creed: Pirates Edition. The ship battles look really cool but the same old AC gameplay is starting to grate on me.</p>

            <p>Shit. I meant on Xbox Live. Sorry, I got so excited I just figured people would understand what I meant. The game took a discount on there, so I’m glad I didn’t have to shell out at Gamestop.</p>
