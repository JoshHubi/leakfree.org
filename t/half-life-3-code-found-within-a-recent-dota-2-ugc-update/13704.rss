    <title>Half-Life 3 code found within a recent DOTA 2 UGC update</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-3-code-found-within-a-recent-dota-2-ugc-update/13704</link>
    <description>[u][b]Before I start this thread. I would like to mention that this thread is not a joke or a hoax. DO NOT FLAME POST! [/size][/b][/u]

[url]https://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=989201[/url]
[url]https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1446236&amp;p=47114380&amp;viewfull=1[/url]

According the original poster on Neogaf - he&#39;s always looking through the latest DOTA &amp; TF2 updates for reference to Source 2. However, when he came across this file - he saw this. 

[img]https://abload.de/img/untitlediixeb.png[/img]

When I saw this I was skeptical to say the least. So I decided to free-up my bandwidth for an hour and download &#39;DOTA 2 Test&#39;. I opened up model_editor.dll in Notepad, Notepad++, and Reshack to confirm this myself. But I did it in realtime, rather than just hit print screen. Here&#39;s the link to the [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKtkrgJ8cYj&#39;]YouTube Video[/url] I made. If you don&#39;t want to watch it - I&#39;ll just sum it up for you. [b][i]It&#39;s there, and this is REAL!  [/size][/i][/b]Comparing this to the HL2 Leaked Beta batch files - the parameters are nearly the same. Except, the difference is; the batch files call HL2.EXE, then specify additional engine commands. Here, it appears that - whatever this is (placed intentionally or not), is actually calling the game engine first, [/i]rather than the executable for the game that then executes the game engine with it&#39;s content specified. 

It&#39;s logical to assume that the next Half-Life game will be shipped on Source 2. Why? A couple reasons. Every new engine Valve has ever made, has been shipped first and exclusively to Half-Life. Now, to be fair - there&#39;s only two game engines Valve has ever shipped. Those being, (of course) Goldsrc, and Source. However, since [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHen8KxsXYI&#39;]Gabe confirmed a while ago that programming for Source 2 was done... completely[/url] (I&#39;m sure what he meant at the time was that they&#39;d reached hit their &#39;Gold&#39; build. Since the video of him confirming Source 2 was done - I&#39;m sure Valve has already implemented plenty of hotfixes.) and that they [i]&quot;...just need a game to ship it [Source 2] with.&quot; [/i]Since it&#39;s always been HL in the past - it&#39;s logical to assume that it would be HL again.

-------------------------------------------------

[b]What everyone [u][i]should[/i][/u] take away from this
[/size][/b]
[/size]1. [b] Just because this references &#39;hl3&#39; [u][i]does not[/i][/u] mean you should assume Half-Life 3 is confirmed.                                                                                                                                                                                    [/b][/size]                                                                                                                              [/size]
1. [b]What we can assume, however, is that [u][i]Source 2 will likely be it&#39;s own client (or be directly integrated into Steam)[/i][/u][/b][/size][b][u][i].[/i][/u][/size] Meaning you start-up Source 2, then select the game you want to play. [/size]                                                                                                                                                                                     [/b]
1. [b]Since this reference is found in the current implementation of Source - it&#39;s likely that Valve is porting games over to Source 2[/b][/size]
Anyways, please share your thoughts on this as I&#39;m as curious to hear theories of others as much as I like to make my own ;P

            <p>I’m hoping that Valve releases Episode Three as a tech demo for Source 2 and closes out the HL2 arc (maybe 4-5 hours like Episode Two), and then release Half-Life 3 a few months later as something with a completely new story, like when HL2 came out.</p>

<p>Well I mean, why the hell not? If it showed up as an extra mode in the multiplayer, I would…ignore it, but joke about it being there.</p>
<p>I mean, that’s also assuming anything Half-Life 3 related is even going on. I understand upholding content until it’s finished, but what is so bad about them just saying “we’re working on it, stay cool guys”?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I know this is an older post but still. The problem is that they haven’t said “we’re working on it, stay cool guys”. There have been various leaks and even hits by Valve but never have they come out in recent years to say that they’re working on HL3. I would love if they did that but they haven’t. And people are getting mad because they refuse to say for certain whether they’re working on it or not, even though we’re pretty sure they are from leaks and stuff. I’m sure everyone would be relieved if they just at one point specifically said that they were working on HL3 and to just be patient.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><span class="bbcode-b">(this is purely my speculation, not a fact or someone’s claim)</span></p>
<p>I think that Valve started working on HL3 or HL2:E3 right after HL2:E2.<br>
So here comes a question.</p>
<p>Is it fair for us gamers, for example,<br>
who have been publicly demanding the next chapter for years,<br>
to wait for HL3 to be finished 2 or 3 years from now (March 2015)?</p>
<p>I mean, yes, they announced Source 2 just lately,<br>
but how long have they been making it?</p>
<p>If they started on both of these at relevantly the same time,<br>
it shouldn’t take long in 2015 for them to at least put up a teaser on the web.<br>
The official HL3 teaser.Or even a picture.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, i am really confused.<br>
For 7 or so years, people craved for the next HL.<br>
And if you have a large number of people, that want a product really badly,<br>
(like me with HL3   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  ) then obviously a good move is to make it and sell it.<br>
I mean, has there been any other Valve game that is more or equally demanding then/as HL?</p>
<p>Of course, Valve is a great company, they have their goals and ideas.<br>
But, dude, come on.</p>

            <p>Hmm… Yeah, it seems weird to me that they’d have a VR presentation marked as a “closely guarded secret”. Given the circumstances, I’m still hoping for Half-Life 3 as well.</p>

<p>Well it looks like GDC will be all about hardware the SteamMachines, Steam Controller and Valves VR set.</p>
<p>I think we ight get a glimpse of Source 2, but by now doubt very much it will be wih any game that can stir a hype.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.egx.net/rezzed/2015/sessions" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Chet Faliszek’s talk at at EGX Rezzed</a> in which he will  show “Secret Content” should also bring something more on the hardware details, however…they need the graphics to show on something…</p>
<p>Directly from website:<br>
Friday 13th March<br>
1pm: Chet Faliszek - Valve<br>
This session’s content is a closely guarded secret! Look out for more information coming soon.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Surprised no one has brought this up. The website has been updated. Chet’s talk is about VR. Not sure why it was a “closely guarded secret.” before. Valve has been talkin’ VR for, what? 2-3 years now?<br>
THAT BEING SAID, every other talk listed on that page is about a <span class="bbcode-i">specific</span> game. Every talk but Valve’s. Follow that up with the fact that this is a public-facing event (as opposed to GDC, which is an industry-facing event), and is therefore a good place to announce something and create buzz.</p>
<p>I’m curbing my enthusiasm… but this is actually the most likely time in years for Valve to announce some big new game.<br>
My HOPE is Half-Life 3, as Valve has a history of using the series to demo what their new engine tech is capable of: Goldsrc with in-game storytelling, Source with physics, …Source 2 with VR?</p>
<p>Hm.</p>

<p>Same case here. Every time Valve is mysterious, I say to myself “This has to be it, just has to be.” I always get disappointed, but I really think this is the year.</p>
