    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-some-help-with-setting-up-deathamtch-on-my-map/15130</link>
    <description>looking to figure out what is needed to set up deathmatch on my map i do not know what i am missing can anyone tell me the necessary steps to making a DM type map? or rather setting up the logic for MP maps?

for those interested i am making a death match map of WGH map01 (i am aware the BMS team is really close to the limit on this map already culled a large amount of entitys/npcs)

if i am lacking coherency sorry bout that when i wake up i will re edit this</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey, I also have some questions regarding setting up a multiplayer deathmatch map.</p>
<p>When running the map from hammer, what commands can I use to run the map in multiplayer mode, rather than singleplayer mode?</p>

            <p>Try my solution:</p>
<p>Load the map HD map, then compile your map without lighting on it (RAD).<br>
Always run BSP and VIS on normal.</p>
<p>And then run your map. Shouldn’t crash.<br>
And make sure you have no leaks in it.</p>

            <p>thanks i was modifying WGH and the game will crash when these settings are not checked in this order</p>
<p>1 RUN BSP -normal</p>
<p>2 RUN VIS - normal</p>
<p>3 RUN RAD -normal</p>
<p>and with HDR if any of those are unchecked the map fails to load and soft crashes</p>
<p>also sorry bout the double post i forget that fourms differ from IRC like clients</p>
<p>alsoe cubemaps seem to have some effect with this when i started using cubemaps i need to use the above mentioned settings</p>

            <p>Please refrain from double posting, edit your post if you have to.<br>
Also, use some dots . In your text as it makes it easier to read, that’s what they’re there for.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there is currently a bug in BMS that you need to launch a map with HDR (lighting) once when starting it.<br>
So either load one of the official maps and then load your map or compile your map once in hdr and load it.</p>
<p>I made a very small map with HDR for people to use so they don’t have to bother with it, just launch it once BMS is started.<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">ALWAYS RENDER WITH HDR BEFORE RELEASING YOUR MAP.</span></p>

            <p>It doesn’t require anything particularly special, apart from info_player_deathmatch where the players will spawn. Make sure you have at least 16 spawns to prevent spawncamping/killing or just bad spawns in general. Then just make sure there’s a good distribution of items and whatnot - all the standard DM stuff for any game, really.</p>
