            <p>Well EC did patch the two things I really hated with the first ending : the galaxy genocide and the Normandy crash on an unknown planet. But there are still so many flaws I’m not completely satisfied.</p>

            <p>Yeah I think the ending is pretty good now. It’s nice and poetic like they intended and it’s now more of an actual <span class="bbcode-i">ending</span> like people wanted.</p>
<p>It’s not perfect, but nothing ever is, I guess. Like why didn’t Harbinger shoot down the Normandy when he had the chance? And how was Normandy able to get so close to the beam without its guidance getting disrupted?</p>
<p>I think it’s ok to ignore some things for artsiness’ sake though.</p>

            <p>The new synthesis ending made me tear up. Specially when they put Shepards name on the wall. I thought the NEW ending was pretty cool too.</p>
<p>But honestly, I would’ve liked to have a option to just FUCKING SAVE SHEPARD. After 5 years of playing in the ME universe as Shepard just to have the hero die with no option otherwise in a game BASED ENTIRELY on your choices is annoying.</p>

            <p>havent been released here yet because the people who organise these things to release suck.<br>
watch the you tube clips. the new ending is good, finally you can the catalyst to jam it. i was bit happier with the break down explanation but still there’s stuff in there that doesn’t make sense.<br>
but i feel as though i would actually play it again now.</p>

            <p>To me it doesn’t seem so much arrogant as a fun jab at whiners.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I was actually kind of amused when the screen just kind of faded out and Shepard was just left standing there with the expression on his face that basically said “well that sucked… now what?”</p>

<p>I guess, but I’ve never seen Bioware as a bunch of arrogant pricks. Maybe EA’s getting to them.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>I believe it was used as a jab to everyone who bitched that they couldn’t argue with the Catalyst. “Aww, you didn’t like our endings? Well fuck you, everyones dead now.”</p>
<p>I got that ending first by complete accident. I shot the Catalyst because I wasn’t expecting it to do anything, seeing as how I shot it before and nothing happened. But then immediately it turns into a cutscene and the kid just says in a menacing voice, ‘SO BE IT.’ It wasn’t so much that the voice change itself scared me, but the fact that I wasn’t expecting it AT ALL. XD</p>

            <p>I have to say I’m a little disappointed that they didn’t go with the indoctrination theory, but I suppose that was a given. It would be a kind of “fuck you” to their writers.</p>

            <p>Give the guy a break…I would say that the demo gives a decent understanding of what the game actually was… Which was just a lot of Cover based shooting with mediocre story telling… I just am not sure how the game that went from such a rich story driven game to a mindless shooting game…Im not pointing fingers but EA, you really sucked all the fun out of the game…</p>
<p>I dont know about you guys but for me the fun was in exploring and learning about how the ME universe ticked … not how i could dodge from one cover to another and shoot an alien in the face and <a>i</a> [/i] learning that the entire reason a certain sentient being is made to save a certain someone from making a certain something that will end up destroying that certain someone</p>

            <p>While I love ME2 and, for the most part, like ME3, I feel they could’ve been a lot better if they have had both more development time (ME3 specially) and more emphasis on non-linear gameplay and story.</p>
<p>ME1 hit the nail right on the head in terms of making me feel that I was really playing a human that felt out of place in an alien world. It had this great, mysterious and, sometimes, eerie tone to it that the sequels did not manage to replicate and I think they suffered a bit for it.</p>

<p>Surely someone has played this as pure renegade and knows the answer.</p>

            <p>Beat ME 3 like 3 days after it was released and never touched the game since then… I was so disgusted with the ending and how bad it was and all the plot holes I Can’t even get myself to get on ME1 and that’s my favorite game of this generation… EA/Bioware really dropped the ball for me…</p>
<p>And as for the IT theory … Bioware isn’t going to go with that because of there artistic integrity and they are only expanding on their shitty ending with extra dialogue … So don’t expect to return to the ME universe for a very long time… Not until all of ME3 is scrubbed from my brain</p>

            <p>I have a question about romances in ME3 and I cant seem to find the answer on Google. Keep it spoiler free please. Also wasn’t there a mass effect 3 thread kicking around?</p>
<p>After having locked into a particular romance, in my case Liara, can you choose every renegade dialog option that comes up without unintentionally ending the relationship? I’m trying to do a pure renegade play through but went to play the romance out. Aside from the few paragon dialogs required to start the romance.</p>
