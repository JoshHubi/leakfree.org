<p>somewhere along the road you installed a fucked up .vmt</p>
<p>The trick to modding is to take it slow, test out one skin at a time until you get the hang of flawless installation.</p>
<p>Another factor is the incompetence of some creators. A lot of the big shots at FPSB are often in such a rush to provide variants of each skin that they fuck up the packaging. This is just something you’ll have to get used to, or learn to fix on your own.</p>
<p>Since you’ve just downloaded a bunch of skins at one time, you likely have no idea which is the offending mod, and you’ll have to uninstall them all if you want to de-chrome everything.</p>
<p>Really, just get rid of that Phoenix and AK and you should be all set. Download different ones.</p>

<p>Yeah that’s what I did, I just removed the mods that were doing that. I was hoping there was a way to make the mod I had downloaded work, but maybe thats just not possible. I may try redownloading and trying again. Thanks for the reply.</p>
