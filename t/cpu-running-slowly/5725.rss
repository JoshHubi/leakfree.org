    <title>CPU Running Slowly</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cpu-running-slowly/5725</link>
    <description>I recently built a computer using an Intel Core i5 760 and it was supposed to run at 2.8 GHz but right now my Rainmeter skin says it&#39;s only running at 1176 MHz. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s running slowly, though I didn&#39;t change any default settings so that may be why.

Also, my mobo is MSI and came with a control center program. I&#39;m looking at the CPU tab right now and it&#39;s information is pretty much empty as if it doesn&#39;t recognize it.

Also, I ran HW Monitor and could someone tell me if these temps are good? I really don&#39;t know anything about it.


Hardware monitor    Fintek F71889F
    Voltage 0    3.39 Volts [0xD4] (+3.3V)
    Voltage 1    0.82 Volts [0x67] (CPU VCORE)
    Voltage 2    1.14 Volts [0x47] (VIN2)
    Voltage 3    1.41 Volts [0x78] (VIN3)
    Voltage 4    5.80 Volts [0x8A] (+5V)
    Voltage 5    0.26 Volts [0x3] (+12V)
    Voltage 6    0.35 Volts [0x16] (VIN6)
    Voltage 7    3.28 Volts [0xCD] (VSB3V)
    Voltage 8    3.17 Volts [0xC6] (VBAT)

    Temperature 2    34°C (93°F) [0x41] (Core #2)
    Temperature 3    31°C (87°F) [0x44] (Core #3)

Hardware monitor    Radeon HD 5870
    Temperature 0    37°C (98°F) (GPU Core)

Hardware monitor    Hitachi HDS721010CLA332
    Temperature 0    30°C (86°F) [0x1E] (Assembly)

Edit: Okay, I just started installing the Clear Sky Complete mod and it jumped to 2801 MHz. I was under the impression that the CPU was supposed to run at a constant speed. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what it does on my laptop. Weird. But still the absence of info about the CPU on the control panel is kind of weird.

Edit Again: It&#39;s also restarted itself twice in the last 1-2 hours. Anyway to run something to tell what, if anything, is wrong?</description>

            <p>So, it just restarted itself again after playing Stalker for an hour or 2. It came back on and when I checked the RAM stuff again it restarted again and came back and it’s still on. The temps are a little higher than what I last posted but I don’t think they were high enough for it to overheat.</p>
<p>I looked at the control center included with the mobo and it says the system fans aren’t spinning even though I can see them spinning. I have no clue what’s wrong and it’s really bugging me.</p>
<p>The HDD voltage is still really low, I wonder if that could be causing the problem.</p>
<p>Edit: It crashed again. My temps have gotten as high as mid 50s. Not sure if that’s too hot or not. Right now they’re hovering around low 40s. Under “Powers -&gt; Processor” the wattage keeps jumping up to 108 occasionally then dropping back to 13. Don’t know what that’s about.</p>
<p>While I was in Bios I noticed that it too keeps saying the system fans aren’t spinning.</p>

            <p>PSU failure? But it doesn’t make sense, the HDD wouldn’t spin at 0.26v, maybe a voltage sensor fail.</p>

            <p>That’s because the memory speed is linked to the CPU speed, that’s why I said you might have to overclock the CPU in order to get your memory to run at full speed but this is usually only the case with 1600 MHz and higher.</p>
<p>About the B2B timing, IF in the future you get random system lock-ups (often with looping sound) then I can assure you 100% that this is related to the B2B timing. So if this happens, go to the BIOS and increase the timing until it stops freezing.</p>
<p>Also, I just remembered what the powersaving feature is called, look in the BIOS for “Intel SpeedStep technology”. This dynamically changes the frequency of your CPU. This is not really a bad thing but if for some reason you want your CPU to run at full speed all the time just turn it off.</p>

            <p>So, I changed the B2B-CAS Delay from 0 to 1. Also changed oned of the timings from 1N to 2N since that’s what my memory does. I don’t know what some of the timings do, though, so I’m leaving those alone.</p>
<p>Edit: Voltage was set to 1.5 v automatically but it won’t let me manually change the frequency. The closest I can get is 1340 MHz but my RAM is 1333 MHz. Not sure if it makes a difference but it’s kind of strange.</p>

            <p>My memory is 9-9-9-24 which is what it was set to when I went in there. It was also set correctly to 1333 (which my motherboard doesn’t have to oc to get to). I don’t think I looked at the voltage of it, though. I didn’t just leave it at a wrong setting  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  . I’ll make sure to look at it again when I start my computer again, though.</p>

            <p>Never let your motherboard automatically set memory voltage and timings, they often jump up and down and sometimes it uses way too much voltage. If you want a stable system with good performance, go in the BIOS and change those timings to the correct values. And the voltage ofcourse. You also want to check the clockfrequency at which the memory is supposed to run, you might have to overclock your CPU to reach the desired memory speed (like 1600 MHz)</p>
<p>There’s no point in buying fast memory with low timings when you let your computer automatically set them, I can assure you the memory will be set to much higher timings using auto.</p>

            <p>I did it when I first started the system up but I’ll look again the next time I turn it on. I don’t think I adjusted anything since the auto set up looked good. I think I’ll leave that power saving setting on. As long as it’s running when it needs to it’s fine.</p>
<p>I have an MSI motherboard. Is there a related setting for it to the Asus one?</p>

            <p>These CPU’s downclock themselves when they’re not under load, this is a powersaving function that can be turned off somewhere in the BIOS. All you have to do is turn them off and the CPU will run at full speed all the time. It’s been quite I while so I forgot what the function is called though.</p>
<p>If the PC is restarting, make sure you’ve set the correct timings and voltages for the memory in the BIOS. The proper settings can be found on a sticker on the side of the memory.<br>
If you have an ASUS motherboard, scroll down while you’re at the timings screen and look for “B2B CAS Latency”, make sure this timing isn’t set at 0 - this can cause your system to randomly lock-up.</p>
<p>Temperatures look fine.</p>

<p>Edit: Okay, I just started installing the Clear Sky Complete mod and it jumped to 2801 MHz. I was under the impression that the CPU was supposed to run at a constant speed. I’m pretty sure that’s what it does on my laptop. Weird. But still the absence of info about the CPU on the control panel is kind of weird.</p>
<p>Edit Again: It’s also restarted itself twice in the last 1-2 hours. Anyway to run something to tell what, if anything, is wrong?</p>
