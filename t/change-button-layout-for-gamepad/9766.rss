    <title>Change Button Layout for GamePad</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/change-button-layout-for-gamepad/9766</link>
    <description>First of all, sorry if my english sucks. Usually I don&#39;t speak or write in english. 

So, back to Topic. It&#39;s not really a bug, i&#39;m reporting, but a Feature, that would be nice to have in the game. I am playing the mod with a 360 Controller and there is one thing, that annoys me a lot. Crouching is put on the left stick, so i have to press and keep it pressed while moving the stick, to move Freeman while crouching. For me personally it would be enough, if there were an option, where crouching can be toggled on and off, so I don&#39;t have to keep the button pressed. But I think there are also a few people who maybe want to change some things of the button layout of the gamepad.</description>
