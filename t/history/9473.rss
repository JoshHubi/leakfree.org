            <p>The third crusade was a bit of grey when it comes to victors. Richard the Lionheart and his cronies did manage to beat Saladin outright at Jaffa, however they failed to recapture Jerusalem which was the crusades’ ultimate goal. The fourth crusade was the best; the Christians basically got off at Constantinople and sacked it thinking it was a Muslim city.</p>
<p>Favourite period of human history would have to be Russian history for the first half of the 20th century. Literally, none of it makes any sense at all Stalin was a complete mentalist.</p>
