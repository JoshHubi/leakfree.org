    <title>Any way to change walk speed?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/any-way-to-change-walk-speed/9982</link>
    <description>First off, I&#39;m [b]not [/b]referring to the &quot;always run&quot; option.

Now, with that said:

Is there anyway to change the default walk speed?

hl2_walkspeed hl2_normspeed hl2_sprintspeed variables all do absolutely nothing.

The &quot;always run&quot; option doesn&#39;t seem to do anything involving speed change except reverse the &quot;sprint&quot; key to walk.  Speed stays the same, and there is no &quot;walk&quot; button, ala HL2, with this option disabled, just sprint.

I&#39;d love to keep the &quot;always run&quot; option to keep it like HL1, just with slower walking movement.  Run speed is fine.  But it seems no matter what values you place or what options you have set, the speed stays the same.

Are the console commands different, or are they hardwired into the .dll files?  Can it be changed at all?  I just want to walk slower.</description>

<p>I see…Do you mean that they are perhaps not so very helpful either for the questions they deem are too stupid to answer ?</p>
<p>This is annoying so badly, I so want to play this game, and all I need is to get that walking in place without changing or modifying anything else.</p>

            <p>[COLOR=‘Lime’]A question I think is somewhat important is before we start changing the variables for walking and running speed, is <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">what is the default walking and running speed ?</span></span><br>
Or at least default running\moving speed since there is no walk in the game by default I guess we can set what ever walk speed we prefer, but I don’t want to change any other default speed that already is set in the game.</p>
<p>I already asked about this in a similar thread but with no replies…<br>
I also heard talk about making the changes in the config file…but no mention where it is to be found.</p>
<p>p.s. The ideal settings in my mind would be hold shift for walking speed in addition too walk toggle with the alt key, I wonder if its possible to have both i.e. toggle with alt, and reverse with shift.</p>

<p>Brilliant, this will work for all intents and purposes for now, thank you!</p>
<p>cl_forwardspeed 80 seems to be just right for me.  I set the toggle key right above my normal walk button, so it works out with minimal interference.  Seems to work just fine while on the fly, too, so battles shouldn’t be affected!  Thank you both again!</p>

            <p>Ok, while it seems timescale can slow things down, it slows down <span class="bbcode-i">everything</span>, like slow motion.  And to get the walking speed I like, everything moves so slow its like a drrrreeeeeaaaaam.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don’t want any game breaking changes that’s going to affect scripts and such, but I’m going to try this anyway.  Will report back.</p>
<p>Also, there’s some custom speed numbers for bms_ cvars in the bms script files, but none of them seem to reference just walking.  Arrrg, this shouldn’t be so difficult!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>After messing around with every variable I could find, the only ones that seem to affect anything are</p>
<p>forwardspeed and maxspeed</p>
<p>However, lowering either of them caps the run speed, making you permanently walk.</p>
<p>“-speed” does nothing.</p>
<p>Ug, so frustrating.  I just want to walk slower!  Default walkspeed is a jog and really kills immersion when I’m looking around checking things out, admiring what an amazing job the team did in recreating the facility.</p>

<p>I’d love to keep the “always run” option to keep it like HL1, just with slower walking movement.  Run speed is fine.  But it seems no matter what values you place or what options you have set, the speed stays the same.</p>
<p>Are the console commands different, or are they hardwired into the .dll files?  Can it be changed at all?  I just want to walk slower.</p>
