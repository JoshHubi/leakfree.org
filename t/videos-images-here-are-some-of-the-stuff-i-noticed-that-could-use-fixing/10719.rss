If you jump down after climbing the ladder, then you&#39;re completely stuck, and you can also touch the elevator and then go to the stairs to load the next map while outside its boundaries.

If you press the elevator button and then get out quickly in Unforeseen Consequences, then you won&#39;t be able to get in to load the next map.

Grunts won&#39;t die when you press the button to make the floor open, instead they just walk on an invisible brush.

This might or might not be something on my part, but if you destroy the tripmine before the scientist even goes to the other side, he&#39;ll get stuck of course. But the door closes from the explosion and for some reason you can&#39;t open the blast door.

You can skip the entire dam sequence by doing this, just got a bit unlucky because I didn&#39;t know that displacement was part of the skybox :v

The Gargantua won&#39;t attack and will just shake the water tank for no reason instead of trying to chase you. If you could make it so that it&#39;ll just walk through the pipes that block him (destroying them) instead of shaking the water tank then it&#39;ll be good.

[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfHf3oK1r0M&amp;feature=plcp[/url]
Just before the water tank bit, pretty sure these cars are very lightweight for the Gargantua to smash through, but it ruins the immersion and just seems silly that the player easily pushes a car like this. Could just make the props static and have it get pushed/explode when the Gargantua goes through them.

Turning on/off flashlight has some effect on the skybox.

Either nodraw texture or some brush error?

Definitely Nodraw texture.

These 3 images are in the same place, basically how will people get to that catwalk if the other side doesn&#39;t have a door?

Hopefully these help somewhat when you&#39;ll make a patch for Black Mesa: Source before it&#39;ll get on steam  :slight_smile: 
And sorry if this doesn&#39;t explain much, I am not really good with explaining.</description>

<p>There is a way to fix this- you’ll need triggers to make the Marines into ragdolls when the doors are opened. Probably set up like:</p>
<p>trigger_once for the area, with a filter_activator_class set to npc_hgrunt (or whatever the dev team uses for marines). The existing func_button for the doors is given a new output to activate the trigger once and have it ragdoll any npc_hgrunt inside it’s volume. If that’s too glitchy or kills soldiers it isn’t supposed to, just name the soldiers and have it kill them if they’re inside the volume by name.</p>
<p>I did something like this for when I needed to make a floor collapse under a combine soldier in my mod.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Who knows, the Devs might’ve put that “button” there on purpose, in case you get stuck or it could be just a bug… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The funny part was how I found out about this “fix” or workaround:</span></p>
<p>After I saw your video I wanted to find some way to open that door, so I took the big wooden crate (next to the silo door) and tried to push it “inside” the button on my side, while manically spamming the E key and somehow, out of nowhere (or so I thought) the door opened.</p>
<p>About 5 tries later I found out that the button I was pressing (the one that magically opened the door) was the metally area below the door.</p>
<p>First I thought that crate thing actually worked - only to find out that there’s sort of a button “area” on the ground… :meh:</p>

            <p>Another (though really small and insignificant) thing:<br>
After I airstrike-killed the gargantua in surface tension, I tried to get back inside (to see if I missed anything while running away from the beast), but there’s an invisible wall in the doorway. The reason is probably that people do not walk back, if they are unable to realize how to continue from here. Unfortunately I don’t have an idea for a solution. Well, maybe when the Gargantua smashes through the doors, the walls indoor could break and block the way with debris or something.<br>
As I said before, it’s probably the most unimportant issue ever posted.<br>

Grunts won’t die when you press the button to make the floor open, instead they just walk on an invisible brush.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think this is because NPC nodes only generate paths for NPC’s if there’s a walkable surface beneath them consisting of brushes, not props, in this case an invisible floor. There oughta be a workaround though.</p>

Grunts won’t die when you press the button to make the floor open, instead they just walk on an invisible brush.</p>

This might or might not be something on my part, but if you destroy the tripmine before the scientist even goes to the other side, he’ll get stuck of course. But the door closes from the explosion and for some reason you can’t open the blast door.</p>

You can skip the entire dam sequence by doing this, just got a bit unlucky because I didn’t know that displacement was part of the skybox :v</p>

The Gargantua won’t attack and will just shake the water tank for no reason instead of trying to chase you. If you could make it so that it’ll just walk through the pipes that block him (destroying them) instead of shaking the water tank then it’ll be good.</p>

Just before the water tank bit, pretty sure these cars are very lightweight for the Gargantua to smash through, but it ruins the immersion and just seems silly that the player easily pushes a car like this. Could just make the props static and have it get pushed/explode when the Gargantua goes through them.</p>

Turning on/off flashlight has some effect on the skybox.</p>

Either nodraw texture or some brush error?</p>

These 3 images are in the same place, basically how will people get to that catwalk if the other side doesn’t have a door?</p>
<p>Hopefully these help somewhat when you’ll make a patch for Black Mesa: Source before it’ll get on steam  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
And sorry if this doesn’t explain much, I am not really good with explaining.</p>
