    <title>How to make crosshair bigger?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-make-crosshair-bigger/10571</link>
    <description>I looked it up in the dev console but it only let me change color from there. It says in the wiki that it&#39;s font-driven and easily changeable. This is kinda cryptic... can anyone explain this further?

I want to change it because I don&#39;t really see anything on the surface.. changing to red helped as always but I would like it to be either bigger or thicker.</description>
