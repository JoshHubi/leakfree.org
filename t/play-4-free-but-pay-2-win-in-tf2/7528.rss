    <title>Play 4 free but pay 2 win in tf2?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/play-4-free-but-pay-2-win-in-tf2/7528</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been playing tf2 for a while now (Who am I kidding? Since it came out.) and have been noticing a scary trend in the induction of new weapoms in the game. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not against having new weapons added to the game, or even having to pay for said weapon(s). My problem is this:

[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPZCKW8XHtc[/url]

Not only is this weapon almost hilariously overpowered, it requires absolutely no skill to use, has infinite ammo, and is expensive as ****. If thats not some sort of God weapon I don&#39;t know what is, as the only &quot;drawback&quot; it has is that it does reduced damage to buildings, which is moot considering that one charged shot can disable any structure for four seconds. I saw a thread yesterday where some guy was complaining about the injustices of tf2 and how hes perpetually being raped by sentry guns built by the God like engies, and now I can kind of understand where hes coming from.

The solution to the guys problem yesterday, would have been to go spy, sap the sentry and then backstab the engie while hes repairing it. But how would you counteract what is basically a big rape machine disguised as a rocket launcher? I mean seriously I thought this thing was a joke, it lights people on fire too, how is that even remotely fair? The asshole in the video basically rides a one man train on the entire opposing team with [b][i]one[/i][/b] weapon.

I hope this does not set the precedent for other weapons that valve is making for tf2, as this looks likes the biggest **** you from valve ever. So do you think tf2 really will be play for free but pay to win in the near future, or am I just over thinking things (again)?</description>

</aside>
<p>What am I implying you are inexperienced at, playing TF2?  All I said was your playtime was less than mine, which means I may be able to weigh my opinions heavier than you.  Why is that such an insult to you?  Its not meant to be.  I never said you were a noob.</p>

<p>You completely missed the point I was attempting to make.  Once again it has nothing to do with what was actually neglected, just the fact that something was neglected.  How do you know people weren’t upset about the 10%? Don’t assume.</p>

</aside>
<p>Certainly something from the 19th century could exist in the 1950’s, but I believe technology would improve and it wouldnt look like it did in the 19th century.  Basically i think it looks out of place in TF2 because nothing else in TF2 is steampunk.  Why does everything have to turn into an argument?  We simply have a difference of opinion, not everyone is going to agree with you, sometimes you just have to accept that.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Again, that is your opinion, I disagree.  For some people, having 10% less damage may have been a reason not to buy the weapon.  What if it were actually 75% less damage, would you still say it doesnt matter that it was neglected?  What is neglected does not matter in this case, the fact that something was neglected is the important thing.  Whatever was neglected, no matter how small in your opinion, could have changed a buyer’s decision.  IMO that’s a big deal.  Like I said before, its not difficult for Valve to remember to include all information about a new weapon when it is released, this isn’t the first time they have had weapon updates.</p>
<p>A little off topic, but as someone who works in the nuclear industry, I value competency and not making stupid mistakes; it is crucial.  Double checking information before releasing is not difficult to do.</p>

            <p>You assumed I spend a lot of time on internet forums, which is wrong.  Sorry but I didn’t realize a picture of a no u-turn sign represented the ‘no u’ meme.  It makes sense now, but like I said, I don’t spend a lot of time on forums.  Instead of being cryptic, due to your attempt to be clever using internet memes, you simply state how you feel?  I was not trying to be verbose and smug, rather straight to the point…you posted a picture of a no u-turn sign, so tried to interpret the meaning behind it.</p>
<p>If your true intent was only to contest my comments regarding the description mistake and art style (nice hurr durrs btw, real mature) then you would not have initially posted “shut the fuck up” along with a copied and pasted CM5000 description from the wiki.  What is the point of simply telling people to shut the fuck up other then to be an asshole?  Are you that angry that that has to be your first post?</p>
<p>How am I making silly provocative assumptions?  What exactly am I assuming?  Im not trying to gain moral or intellectual superiority over you, sorry if you think so.  I am not trying to attack you, but rather understand your intentions.  You are the one who immediately contests people’s opinions, usually without providing any solid reasoning for your opinion, as if there is some inherently correct viewpoint and your opinion is fact.  Good for you if you think valve’s description neglect isn’t important, good for you with you think the new weapons fit the TF2 style, I do not agree so live with it.</p>
<p>Again…tell me how I am “shitting bricks?” Explaining yourself and your reasoning is one thing you neglect and need to do more often.</p>
<p>I try and post valid arguments and reasons for my opinions, so I can provide insight.  You decide to ignore them and nitpick my posts.</p>
<p>BTW, I have not called you any names.  The worst I did was call you a tough guy. Sorry. Also, what do you mean by “I merely contended what I know is absolute wad a boarshit?”  It looks like you’re trying to say “I merely insisted what I know is absolute bullshit.”</p>

            <p>Hey guys, why not play in the vanilla servers if you have an issue with content valve is adding. It’s always been an option, and i’m surprised more people don’t play with the vanilla ruleset.</p>

            <p>With regards to the thread, I do not think the game has become f2p, p2w, because IIRC all items eventually make their way into the trading market.  Every weapon can be obtained for free at some point in time.  Just because some people choose not to wait and buy items immediately is a choice, and everyone has that choice.</p>
<p>Spending money is not the only way to obtain items, its simply the quickest way.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes really.  Even though I do not pay money for anything in TF2, some people do.  The uselessness of the shop however, does not change the fact that Valve has a responsibility to serve their paying customers and making stupid, inexcusable mistakes when releasing updates is shitty.  It’s definitely a fuck up, because people paid money expecting one thing and it turned out to be different.  How do you know Valve did not purposefully withhold the negative attributes in order to garner more sales?</p>

<p>First off, I guess your trying to imply I am making some form of mental or argumentative u-turn with that image, going back on my words or something along those lines, but what that has to do with me telling you to go fuck yourself is perplexing.  I may be complaining about Valve and their updates, but there is reason to do so and I have stated them.  What have you done besides criticize?</p>
<p>So…how exactly am I “shitting bricks?”  I love how you act like the forum tough guy.  You need to realize this is the internet and you dont always need to open your mouth, spewing un-insightful grivel.  Like Ive said, I am not the only one who dislikes the new updates for one reason or another and some will complain.  I do not understand your desire to defend Valve’s decisions.</p>
<p>Ive said it before and will say it again…if you do not agree with me simply ignore my posts or prove me wrong.  There’s no need to simply criticize.</p>

<p>Honestly I know mistakes are made, but considering they only released two weapons that’s a pathetic mistake for a professional company like Valve.  Thats not a lot to remember and keep track of.</p>
<p>Its a pretty big mistake, considering some people paid money (certainly not me) for the weapon only to find out after that it has more downsides then advertised.</p>

</aside>
<p>I do not have a problem with the righteous bison other than the fact that its a soldier weapon, lasers and ray guns are more appropriate for the engineer. Again, a laser launcher with exploding projectiles is absurd.  Its either a laser or an explosive, not both.  A large laser weapon burning holes in shit, slicing off limbs, or something along those lines and designed for the engineer is much more appropriate IMO.  Apparently you did not comprehend my last post.</p>
<p>With regards to playing on vanilla servers, most of the TF2 updates have been solid, my ONLY complaint with the updates is lack of diversity with regards to classes.  6 soldier packs vs. 2 for the pyro, 1 for the engie, and 3 for the other classes.  Just a tad lopsided.  Let me guess ODB, your primary class is soldier?</p>
<p>Oh and with regards to whinging…go fuck yourself, who the fuck are you?  Im simply pointing out my perceived flaws in TF2…and some people do agree with me.  You don’t like my posts? Don’t read them.</p>

            <p>You’re just so wrong its incredible. Retro sci-fi is completely different than Retro. One is a past idea of what the future will be, and one is the past. TF2 takes place in the past with some scientific advances which look like you would exist in the past. That is not retro sci-fi, which would take place in the future.</p>

</aside>
<p>Agreed.  Insightful link BTW.</p>
<p>By far, my biggest complaint is the fact that the soldier receives so many fucking updates when compared to other classes.  Its okay to have a lot of weapons/items, but not when other classes are constantly neglected.  Engineer has gotten nothing for about a year, and like I mentioned before, the pyro’s new flare gun the detonator, is practically worthless.  Flare jump?  More like flare hop at the cost of 25% dmg…you can’t even use it to reach useful heights, like battlements, so whats the point?</p>
<p>The real kicker, according to that website…a 4th soldier pack is being released within the year.  Lets keep giving people more reason and incentive to play soldier, as if teams werent already soldier-saturated and maps werent already filled with rocket spam.  Looks like my airblast will be getting some overtime.</p>
<p>Fuck you Valve.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree that lasers can fit in TF2, but they aren’t essential and their current application sucks.  IMO, teleporters are vital to engineers, as are healing beams and cloaks to medics and spies respectively.  No matter how sci-fi those technologies are, they are important in order for those classes to exist in a useful fashion.  Its true that lasers are acceptable in TF2, but why did they have to go to the greedy soldier in the form of a rocket launcher?  It makes much more sense for lasers to be implemented by the neglected engineer.</p>
<p>I think the reason I was so against the idea of ray guns/lasers in TF2 is the fact that the ray/laser is in the form of a fucking launcher wielded by the soldier.  IMO that idea is absurdly stupid.</p>

            <p>The Mangler itself is not OP.  That piece of shit Charge Shot needs to be nerfed to oblivion, as does the Soldier himself to an extent.</p>
<p><a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/TeamFortress2" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/TeamFortress2</a></p>
<p>Most of my thoughts on the Gradbort pack thing is under “Base Breaker”.  But seriously, the Soldier did not deserve new weapons, and now he’s muscling in on another classes’ territory with the Mangler.  The Charge Shot has increased base damage + Mini-Crits + Insane knockback + AFTERBURN + The ability to deactivate Engineer buildings for 4 seconds.  One of the Pyro’s sole unique mechanics is in the hands of this weapon hog now.  And if you’re any good and have the Shotgun, you can completely circumvent the “Less building damage” downside.  Hell, the Righteous Bison (Which should have been given to the Engineer, damn it) can do it too:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlNR1kvKjTo" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlNR1kvKjTo</a></p>
<p>Really, I think Valve made the charge shot the way it is just to see what would happen.  The afterburn and building deactivation were put in there just to see how much rage (And possibly money) they could squeeze out of SPUF in one go.  Will this set a precedent for future weapons?  God I hope not.  Is it’s a sign of Pay 2 Win TF2?</p>
<p>Not really, because I think part of the reason the weapon’s price is jacked up so high is because Valve wanted to repay WETA for all their hard work that they did without provocation.</p>

            <p>It needs a little tweeking but its not that op.  Maybe a little further damage less.  But most new weapons that valve releases aren’t balanced at first or even for months.</p>
<p>Anyways space lasers fits tf2 perfectly.  TF2 has always had a retro-futurist spytech type feel.  It has teleporters, healing beams, invisible cloaks and such.  Tell me why lasers don’t fit in with all that?</p>

            <p>After playing for a couple of hours, I must say facing the CM5000 as a pyro is great.  The projectiles are really slow, easy to reflect, and for whatever reason I tend to get lots of kills off the reflections, whether they were charged or not.  Generally when I reflect rockets, even if I hit people I’m lucky if I get a kill; enough damage isn’t inflicted.  With the CM5000 however, whenever I reflect a shot and it connects I consistently get one or two kills…its ridiculous and very interesting IMO.</p>
<p>The CM5000 feels more powerful than the rocket launcher with regards to reflections.</p>

            <p>Its still pretty op’d in my opinion. You make a point by saying the damage has been reduced by 10%, but seriously? You can tell its still op’d by the amount of people using it and its price in the mann co store. Second, my question was: If you thought this set a precedent in tf2 where you could buy special weapons like (but not limited to) the cm5000 and dominate the game, Therefore effectively turning tf2 into a ten year old’s p4f but p2w game?</p>

            <p>I always thought the pyro should be able to use hand grenades…perhaps those things dangling off his chest? :retard:<br>
Anyone remember the pyro nades from TFC?  That idea was definitely cool.</p>

<p>everything that was fixed is a simple ommision in displayed stats. The gun itself is the same:</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sorry, I thought it was a nerf and not simply a display update. Not displaying the drawbacks as part of the attributes is a bad idea, they should have just shown them from the start.  Instead it was assumed by many, including yourself, that each rocket was as damaging as the normal launcher.  From your wiki quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…This weapon is able to fire 5 blasts of energy that delivers <span class="bbcode-b">identical damage to players as the Rocket Launcher</span>…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Im sorry but if that were the case then my point is valid.  When combined with its flame induction and mini-crit charge ability, the cow mangler could have been considered overpowered in comparison.  As it stands now, 5 mangler rounds can deal 405 damage versus the regular launcher’s 4 at 360, not to mention the damage induced from the flames at 3 per tick.  If each rocket was actually as strong as we initially thought, you would be comparing the mangler’s 450 + afterburn versus the launcher’s 360. I would consider that overpowered.  The fact that it is 10% weaker than the normal launcher does help, but I still think 5 rounds is one too many.  At least a recent update slowed the reload rate by 5% (plus fixed an error where charged shots were causing too much damage), so that helps some.</p>
<p>Ive played against the mangler for a little while and I like I’ve said, I didnt have a huge problem with it since I play pyro.  I was judging a lot from the initial, misleading stats and from seeing it in action against my teammates.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I understand how ray guns, space men, and “war of the worlds” type of things are retro, but my opinion about tf2 style and how ray guns don’t fit is simply that…my opinion.  Sorry you don’t like it.  With regards to the medic, hes always had and should have the ability to heal.  IMO the healing beam and ubers are a good solution and necessary to keep the medic as a relevant/essential element of tf2.  Like I’ve said before, the soldier already has plenty of weapons…and now hes even getting crazy ray guns?  That’s just going overboard, it’s unnecessary.</p>
<p>A little off-topic, but I always liked the medic’s infection ability in TFC, I always thought that was a neat concept.  It definitely has potential in TF2 if implemented correctly.</p>
