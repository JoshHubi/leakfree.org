    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/co-operative-hl-decay/3130</link>
    <description>Can anyone tell me if someone work on remake in source of Decay? I didn`t find anything..about; it would be nice that after Black Mesa is released Decay to become mod of Black Mesa, in Decay we see that the anti-mass spectrometer is not only controlled from the control room above; I think that deserves, it`s part of Black Mesa Research Facility too</description>

<p>As has already been pointed out, the BM team have no plans to remake any other Half-Life games after BM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for other source remakes, if you couldn’t find any by searching on the net, chances are there aren’t any. If anyone knows differently feel free to link them. [COLOR=‘Red’]Otherwise, there’s really nothing more to discuss in this thread.</p>

            <p>Of which then it would be a new team aka a different team.  I could be wrong, but I am rather sure the official statement is that the Black Mesa team will only be creating Black Mesa and that is it.</p>

<p>I think other people have already made it obvious to you that the BM team won’t be doing that, you should’ve asked in the half-life series section, not here, and you were better off asking on the forums of the PC port.</p>

<p>It`s not a problem…after Black Mesa is released maybe they will form a new team; BM contains most of the materials which could build Decay is like a serial movie…like HL 2 and episodes  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I still wish the BM team would do Decay… I’m sure a lot of their work so far could be recycled, and the task would be significantly smaller than BM from scratch, but still not a short project.</p>
<p>I just love it because it is designed to be coop, whereas most coop mods and many coop modes are basically just a single player game with 2 people and more/harder enemies.</p>
<p>(But yeah, one can dream right? Guess we just gotta hope someone’ll remake it someday)</p>

            <p>Hahaha I already suggested the creation of this once Black Mesa is released. We might need the source code however. Hopefully the Bm team will see the possibilities of releasing the Black mesa Source code, I mean think about it. So many amazing thins could come out of it. Sven Coop Source anyone?</p>

<p>No, so far no mod team is working on a Source version of Decay. And even if it would be a mod to BMS it would be difficult to code without the BMS source code. Unless if course, BM coop ever gets released.</p>

            <p>I think other people have already made it obvious to you that the BM team won’t be doing that, you should’ve asked in the half-life series section, not here, and you were better off asking on the forums of the PC port.</p>

            <p>Can anyone tell me if someone work on remake in source of Decay? I didn<code>t find anything..about; it would be nice that after Black Mesa is released Decay to become mod of Black Mesa, in Decay we see that the anti-mass spectrometer is not only controlled from the control room above; I think that deserves, it</code>s part of Black Mesa Research Facility too</p>
