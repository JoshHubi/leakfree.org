    <description>So far, I am definitely impressed with this re-mastering of Half-Life. And seeing that it is an early access game I kind of expected it to be a bit buggy. The only issue I&#39;ve run into so far however is the display is almost constantly clipping/flickering. I have anti-aliasing turned all the way up with &quot;wait for vertical sync&quot; enabled. I don&#39;t know if anyone else is experiencingn this or not. I&#39;m not noticing any lag or anything like that. Just the picture stutters.</description>

<p>If that does not work try turning off MSAA. We think we know what the issue is but we are still investigating. Thanks!</p>

<p>“Clipping” is probably the wrong word as clipping generally refers to when geometry intersects.</p>
<p>What do you mean by ‘clipping’ and ‘flickering’? Does the image flash every now and then or does it wobbly strangely? Could you tell us your computer’s specifications?</p>
