    <title>Half-screen lag</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-screen-lag/12280</link>
    <description>If I am scrolling down a window, or watching a youtube video, or whatever, it&#39;ll take less than half a second for the screen to realign with itself. It&#39;s like this weird lag where half of the screen arrives later than its counterpart.

I probably haven&#39;t provided an adequate description of the problem, but I&#39;ve never seen it before and I don&#39;t really know how to describe it.

EDIT: Also, should have specified that it&#39;s not continuous. It happens every 20ish seconds. Maybe more.</description>
