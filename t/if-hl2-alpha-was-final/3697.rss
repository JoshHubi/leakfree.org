    <title>If  hl2 alpha was final?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/if-hl2-alpha-was-final/3697</link>
    <description>Ok, we have all seen footage of the half life 2 alpha...with the different stalkers... different aliens...monsters blah blah blah.

Now...two questions for discussion:

     1. How much more scarier is the leaked alpha compared to the final release of Half life 2?
     
     2. Which version did you like better and why?


I personally liked the alpha more than the final.</description>

<p>I suppose it’s possible we may see it in Episode 3, given that they’re bringing back beta content, but it seems unlikely. Oh well, there’s always mods!</p>

</aside>
<p>Like how it’s in sven co-op 2?</p>
<p>Well, was.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>If HL2ep3 is the last installment to the serie, they’re probably fitting everything they can into it. THe last game is an appropriate time for load blowing.</p>

            <p>Don’t know about you guys, but I prefered the “child workers” idea they had back in beta development, instead of suppressing the reproduction of humanity. It would make you hate the combine more then it does now in final version of the game. Also I think it didn’t really make sense to have a suppressing field anyway; if you’ve enslaved humanity, you wouldn’t want to make them extinct. I guess the combine would turn it off when the humanity would be nearing its extinction, but it still makes less sense to me then forcing kids to work.</p>
<p>Also, I wish they left the Manhack arcade in final version  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>I personally liked several of the original concepts for half-life 2, it was very interesting. The imbalance of weapons could be solved in a way like you get a certain set of more balanced weapons for a short time, something happens, you lose them, get a different mix of balance after that, etc… stuff like the Combine Guard Gun could only be owned for a short time, like the super gravity gun.</p>

<p>If you want to see what might have been the final project of the beta just download missing information. Its always fun to see beta content, and some of the levels (I don’t think) should have been cut but easier said than done.</p>

<p>Agree. MI also known as Bingo Mod has also a MODDB profile here:<br>

<p>Instead of just using the Alpha stuff, they are now going to recreate NPCs and maps and it is really impressive!</p>

            <p>The beta was cool but the final product rules. If you want to see what might have been the final project of the beta just download missing information. Its always fun to see beta content, and some of the levels (I don’t think) should have been cut but easier said than done.</p>
<p>EDIT: The guns were also cool but they all kind of acted the same. Example the IOCW MP5 and MP7 the only thing that varied was the damage and rate of fire.</p>

            <p>If all the alpha concepts were the final version, and the final Half-Life 2 features were alpha concepts, the people who prefer the alpha would probably want the normal Half-Life 2.</p>
<p>It’s just people wanting to try something different I think.</p>

            <p>I really liked the alpha looking version, a lot of it I was excited to play but when i look back on half life 2 now it really wasn’t that amazing; sure it was a great game and I’m hanging for episode 3.</p>
<p>I dunno guess it looked a lot more intense.</p>
