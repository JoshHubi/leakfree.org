How do you like the nominations so far?

I think it&#39;s mostly fair, with the exception of Avatar being picked way too damn much.

Best movie? Pleeeeeeeeeeeease... 

Happy to see The Hurt Locker there a lot, but totally bummed there&#39;s not a single nomination for Moon.</description>

            <p>I just realized that Sherlock Holmes got nominated for best original score. Now… even though Mr. Fox and Up both had great music, I thought the score in Sherlock was just amazing. That paired with Guy Ritchie’s action scenes is what made that movie for me (and Robert Downey Jr.), and I really think it deserves to win, although all of us know it won’t  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> .</p>

            <p>I think Up will win <span class="bbcode-b">Best Animated Picture</span>, and Avatar will easily win <span class="bbcode-b">Best Achievement in Cinematography</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">Best Achievement in Visual Effects</span>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Best Picture</span>, however, I think is still very much up in the air. Inglourious Basterds was good, but not as good as some of Tarantino’s older stuff. I don’t think Avatar will get it, simply because only its visuals were really standout, everything else was merely adequate. Up was good, but a little shallow for best picture. District 9 was excellent, and might get it just for the fact that its a really good representation apartheid, but looking back it didn’t seem like it was absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>The problem with all of them is that I missed quite a few, so objectivity is completely absent from my post  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> .</p>

            <p>Avatar is maybe too overrated, yes, but I think it earns the most of its nominations even if it is maybe the most expensive and overhyped movie of all time.</p>
<p>As for District 9, it was a good movie and I enjoyed it, but It just didn’t get me that much… I actually hate that low budget films get way too litte attention compared to the massive films like avatar, but it’s also ridiculous that there’s people that think there can’t be a good film that has a budget over million dollars. Yes, it’s very rare, but I think this time it happened. [COLOR=‘Black’]NO MATTER U SAYIN</p>

            <p>Inglorious Basterds should win Best Picture, just because it was a refreshing movie in the bulk that was generic and standard.</p>
<p>But Avatar will win that one because it pleased the audience with CGI, nevermind the fact that the story sucked massive bitter balls.</p>
<p>And I never even heard of The Fantastic Mr. Fox o_O</p>

            <p>I agree. I honestly didn’t expect District 9 to be nominated at all. Let alone for best picture.<br>
It needs to win <span class="bbcode-b">EVERYTHING</span>.</p>
<p>And yeah I agree with Maxey; not a single nomination for Moon is a bit dissapointing.</p>

            <p>Definitely Inglourious Basterds/The Blind Side for best movie, really enjoyed both. For animated I’d give Up an edge over Mr. Fox, just because I loved Up so much, even though Fox is still an amazing movie.</p>

            <p>I didn’t like <span class="bbcode-b">The Hurt Locker</span> at all.</p>
<p>I never saw <span class="bbcode-b">Avatar</span>, so don’t put that against my choices.</p>
<p>I am torn between if I want <span class="bbcode-b">Up</span> or<span class="bbcode-b"> The Fantastic Mr. Fox</span> for best animated film.</p>
<p>Best Score was def <span class="bbcode-b">The Fantastic Mr. Fox</span>.</p>
<p>Best Editing, if it doesn’t go to <span class="bbcode-b">District 9</span>, my roommates will never hear the end of it. They did all that with a budget that’s dwarfed by <span class="bbcode-b">Avatar</span> and the like.</p>
<p>Personally, I think <span class="bbcode-b">Inglorious Basterds</span> should receive Best Picture.</p>

            <p>Meh their attempt at pleasing the wider audiences by making 10 nominees for best movie and then putting the top 5 box office hits there was pretty lame imo, but I’ll still watch it I guess… I always do  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> .</p>
<p>I find that the Golden Globes are way more accurate when it comes to actually judging the quality of movies, though.</p>
