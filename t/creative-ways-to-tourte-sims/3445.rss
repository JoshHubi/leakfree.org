            <p>I called the cops and then built a fence around them.<br>
Then they just stood there for a really long time until they pooped themselves and died of fear. Not original?</p>
<p>I had already killed two families in the pool there.<br>
The last guy that lived there was the one who kept calling the cops.</p>
<p>He got tired of the fact that  the tortured remnants of the past inhabitants weren’t capable of containing their Ectoplasmid fluids. So he left.</p>

            <p>see I had made a secret room inside the walls of my house, when you opened up the door you would find yourself in a room with concrete walls and a fireplace on the end oppisite of the doors.</p>
<p>I even had a fireplace in the living room on the other side of the wall so as to not have an unexplainable chimney in the roof. :awesome:</p>

            <p>I put the trash bins in so that they would catch fire when the fire was lit, thus creating a massive inferno that nobody could escape.</p>
<p>the listening to the screams was poetic license. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>back in my sims days, I made a creepy butler that lived in a mansion, and I’d invite people over, call them into my special room, then light the fireplace run out and delete the doors, add a bunch of trash bins and listen to the screams through the wall.</p>
<p>after there was nothing left, I added their tombstone to my collection in the backyard.</p>

<p>I dont play sims so I am sure this is a noob question.  I think I followed you all the way up until you said you add a bunch of trash bins and listen to the screams through the wall.  What does that mean?</p>

            <p>I usually just invite people over and delete the doors and have them die from hunger. That or I just light the carpet on fire and exthinguish it after they’ve burned to death.</p>

            <p>My preferred Torture method was to put a family in a room with just an oven and a couch and make them argue with each other. Most of the time they would just start a fire and die. The other method was to use the move_objects on cheat and move a little kid over the pool and make them drown. Hehe…:evil:</p>
