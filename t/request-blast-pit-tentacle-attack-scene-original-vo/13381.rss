    <title>Request: Blast Pit Tentacle Attack Scene Original VO</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/request-blast-pit-tentacle-attack-scene-original-vo/13381</link>
    <description>Hey! I have a simple question: does anybody have access to the original voiceover lines for the Tentacle Attack Scene shown in the 2008 trailer? [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lul60ixy_40[/url] at 1:05 for reference. I haven&#39;t done too much digging in the sound files for them, but I&#39;ve fished up other cut dialog in the past. I would really like to use the original scientist lines, but I&#39;m not sure if they were completely removed or if they&#39;re still buried in the files. Any information would help. Thanks in advance. -Lockjaw</description>

<p>A ha! Forgot about that! But, psst… <em>holds up hands</em> Now uh, don’t get me wrong, leaks are horrible and unfortunate! Bad, bad Valvetime! Their review was bull! And screw that German guy who messed up HL2! But, uh… <em>whispers</em> Thank you.</p>

<p>Oh, yes that particular one is a worthy candidate. But I was talking about a different leak… fora remake of another game that I will not mention here.</p>
