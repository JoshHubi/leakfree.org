    <title>Should I play HL before BM at this point?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/should-i-play-hl-before-bm-at-this-point/9354</link>
    <description>Hey, long-time fan/reader, first time poster. 

I know this thread has been posted before but considering the change in circumstances I wanted the board&#39;s opinion. 

Now, I have tried to play through HL before, I own the original and I made it quite a bit of the way through the game. I honestly don&#39;t remember how far I got but I&#39;m pretty sure I sent the rocket into space. I don&#39;t remember if I fought any Gargantuas (this may be contradictory to the previous statement). The problem arose when my game saves were corrupted and I was unable to continue; since then I haven&#39;t tried again (years ago). 

So if I were to play it again, I&#39;m guessing I would have to buy Half-Life: Source, if that fixed the save corruption issues?

The reason I ask is since the mod is almost at release the time is approaching where if I were to play BMS I would be unable to ever have the experience of having played HL1 first, considering there&#39;s probably going to be quite a few callbacks and things that only an original player would notice (Yes, I know this is not a 1:1 conversion)

I have played through HL2-HL2EP2 already.</description>

<p>I have autosave 0 in autoexec but it still autosaves, so annoying</p>
<p>Also I have completed Half life twice from start to finish today. Speedrunning like crazy and skipping whole chapters using glitches but I am not using cheats.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I think I’m going to mirror the suggestions of most of the others here and say that while it isn’t really necessary, playing the original first would likely make you appreciate BM that much more.</p>
<p>So, if you care about that sort of thing, then yes, play HL first.</p>

            <p>My advice would be to play Black Mesa first, then Half-Life afterwards for the Xen experience and for comparison. You’ll get to play Black Mesa with a fresh perspective on the game which is something I wish I could do. If I could erase my memory of Half-Life to play Black Mesa as if for the first time, I would.</p>

            <p>Yes, play Half-Life from beginning to end before you play Black Mesa. You don’t have to, but it will add something that’s an important part of Black Mesa: nostalgia and a sense of seeing something again, but differently…</p>
<p>I have rarely encountered save corruptions in Half-Life, if ever, so I’d say just go play it and don’t worry about this, it’s very unlikely to happen again. Or just back up the SAVE folder after each time you play, copy it somewhere to be safe. But really, this shouldn’t be an issue!</p>
<p>Oh, and most people who played Half-Life: Source suggest that the original, non-source version is better, so I’d say if you’re going to buy something, buy the original, not the Source version. After all, Black Mesa is a remake of the original, not the HL: Source version, even though the difference is minor.</p>

            <p>I haven’t had any save corruption problems on either version. But as the others said if you’re not in the habit of at least quicksaving often then enable autosave. Putting it in the autoexec.cfg like Sarge says would have it do it automatically every time the game starts. It’s not cool to be pulled from Blast Pit back to Anomalous Materials just because you were a little louder than you thought.</p>

<p>True. I got about 1/2 way through HL Source, saved, came back a week later, and had no saved data. IDK if it was for the same reason, but I will heed this advice in the future.</p>

<p>I haven’t seen any save corruptions on my experience.  On Source and in the updated version on Steam. From my understanding, you bought the retail copy years ago right?  If you still have the box with the CD key, you can put that CD key in Steam and get the HL Steam Version (not Source, just Steam) for free.  As well as some other old Valve/HL games.</p>
<p>Valve updated the game a lot when they put it on Steam, so chances are the glitch should be gone.  And depending on which version you bough retail, you may have noticed that the “tilt” when you move left or right that was present in some of the original releases of HL is no longer there.  And the menu should be different as well.</p>
<p>I would recommend you start off with the plain old vanill HL from Steam.  Source is a decent port but it has some really bad bugs that can ruin the game.  Music cuts out in loading screens, some lighting (especially in Xen) is really messed up.  As well as a lot of the physics.  Nothing is really “game breaking” but the bugs suck nonetheless.  The normal game will do you just fine.  Just be careful about widescreen monitors.  The field of view is really bad but it can be customized via console commands.</p>
<p>I know this is a lot, but I just want to make sure your potentially first completion of HL is a good one  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Well thats great, I went and bought HL Source on impulse before I saw this after holding off for 8 years X_X</p>
<p>Let me clarify; I’ve never owned the retail version of Half-Life. I got Half-Life 2 with a graphics card when it came out and played through that, it being my first introduction to the franchise. Then my friend said I needed to play Half-Life, which, for some reason I inexplicably received for free, along with Opposing Force and Blue Shift.</p>
<p>So the only version of Half-Life I’ve ever played is the Steam version, which does still have the save corruption issues.</p>
<p>I have a 16:10 monitor so I will have widescreen issues. Is that with both Source and the original?</p>

<p>Its not a 1:1 remake but its still has to resemble half-life. Meaning as a person who has played HL1 I will know the story, the setting, roughly when enemies are introduced, the weapons and such. You would know nothing of this, so instead of it being refreshing it would be completely fresh.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think I’d enjoy the nostalgia along with the changes rather than the changes without the nostalgia. Especially considering I roughly know the layout of what I haven’t played in the game from accumulated information over time.</p>
<p>Reread my OP, I’m not completely new to HL; I’ve played up until I reached save corruption issues.</p>

<p>Do you know if the save corruption issues from the original are still present in Source?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I haven’t seen any save corruptions on my experience.  On Source and in the updated version on Steam. From my understanding, you bought the retail copy years ago right?  If you still have the box with the CD key, you can put that CD key in Steam and get the HL Steam Version (not Source, just Steam) for free.  As well as some other old Valve/HL games.</p>
<p>Valve updated the game a lot when they put it on Steam, so chances are the glitch should be gone.  And depending on which version you bough retail, you may have noticed that the “tilt” when you move left or right that was present in some of the original releases of HL is no longer there.  And the menu should be different as well.</p>
<p>I would recommend you start off with the plain old vanill HL from Steam.  Source is a decent port but it has some really bad bugs that can ruin the game.  Music cuts out in loading screens, some lighting (especially in Xen) is really messed up.  As well as a lot of the physics.  Nothing is really “game breaking” but the bugs suck nonetheless.  The normal game will do you just fine.  Just be careful about widescreen monitors.  The field of view is really bad but it can be customized via console commands.</p>
<p>I know this is a lot, but I just want to make sure your potentially first completion of HL is a good one  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Also, thank you for someone finally answering the HL-S question.</p>
<p>We’ll know less of whats coming regardless because its not a 1:1 remake right?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its not a 1:1 remake but its still has to resemble half-life.  Meaning as a person who has played HL1 I will know the story, the setting, roughly when enemies are introduced, the weapons and such.  You would know nothing of this, so instead of it being refreshing it would be completely fresh.</p>

<p>I would recommend you go ahead and play the original.  I know the game is buggy (both the original and the Source version have their fair share of bugs) but that way you can play Black Mesa and have somewhat of a nostalgia force behind you.  To be honest, I beat Half-Life 1 (Source) for the first time ever about a month ago.  Were there some parts I was ready to throw in the towel and say “screw this and wait for BM”?  Oh, yes.  But I got through it on normal.  And Black Mesa will mean a greater deal to me now since I experienced the original too.  I’ve watched walkthroughs of the entire game many times, but beating it for yourself is so much better.  And if you don’t make it to the end before next Friday, that’s fine, play BM.  But you should be able to make it to the end in about 2-3 days.  1 even, if you have nothing else to do.</p>

            <p>Either way really. Having played the original, I think the remake will be better since the tech is updated and it’s basically a labor of love. Having said that, playing the original is recommended either way.</p>
