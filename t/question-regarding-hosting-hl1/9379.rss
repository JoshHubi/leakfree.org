    <title>Question regarding hosting HL1</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/question-regarding-hosting-hl1/9379</link>
    <description>Hello,
**Skip the next paragraph if you want to skip straight to the question***

I have a quick question regarding a particular event I want to do with a few friends. Prior to the BMS release I want to do a Half Life 1 marathon in Sven COOP, and this time I am in charge of the server hosting like I usually do. Thing is that we are planning to have about 19 people, and I generally only use a listen server. A few friends advised me to install a dedicated server on a separate machine as it will reduce the lag and improve the gameplay for everyone.

My question is: will it really make a difference in terms of performance / lag if I setup a dedicated server on a separate machine using HLDS (on the same network, just different laptop), or a listen server will suffice since GoldSRC engine isnt that demanding comparing to Source (in which case the performance is noticeable).
The specs of the laptop I am planning to use are:
Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 64bit
Intel i5 vPro 2520M @ 2.50Ghz
4GB RAM
Intergrated Intel chip

Thank you  :slight_smile:</description>
