    <title>Power Up Garg missing effect</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/power-up-garg-missing-effect/12695</link>
    <description>Hello  :slight_smile:  I&#39;ve got a problem. The thing is: in Power Up when you are going to that generator room, and you destroy Gargantua there is a blue cloud (and I used to have it) but now it is gone. I&#39;m not sure if it has something to do with it, but in console there is something like: &quot;Unable to create an unknown particle system gargantua_gib_fx&quot;. Is it problem with my files; or because I installed On a Rail Uncut? Or maybe both? I know that this problem is a Nit-Pick but I like to have everything perfect, you know :3 Is there any way to fix this? Thank You in advance  :smiley:</description>

            <p>OK, so, I didn’t re-install Black Mesa yet but I have extracted the particle_manifest.txt from .rar archive and I have loaded my save 6 times. One out of six times didn’t have blue cloud, so I guess, it is somewhat fixed… But just in case of emergency, I will post my problems here. But now I want to Thank You, for your help, and your time that you used to help me.

<p>OK, so, sorry for late reply. I have got all 101 pcf files. And also that error about Unable to create/Attempted to create an unknown particle system is still showing in console.</p>
<p>EDIT: It also says Attempted to precache an unknown particle system gargantua_gib_fx.</p>
