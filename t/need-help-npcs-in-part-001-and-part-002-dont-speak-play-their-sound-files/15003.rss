    <title>Need Help: npcs in part 001 and part 002 don&#39;t speak/ play their sound files</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-help-npcs-in-part-001-and-part-002-dont-speak-play-their-sound-files/15003</link>
    <description>when I starting playing the 2 parts, no npc&#39;s could speak. My sound is fine, i reinstalled my drivers and downgraded but no luck. Their mouths weren&#39;t moving that I could see and no voice files were playing. Need help :!:  :!:  :!: . The weapon sounds are fine and can be heard, It&#39;s just NPC&#39;s and monsters that won&#39;t play their sounds, from what i know of.</description>
