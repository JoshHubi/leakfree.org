    <description>Well, before trolls troll, I&#39;d like to clarify that this is a Help and Support forum, not technology and gaming, so it&#39;s in the correct place.

To the business, I&#39;m thinking about getting an airsoft gun, under 300 dollars. AEGs are preferred, and I&#39;d like them full metal and/or bullpup styled.</description>

<p>Very, very true. One of the best pistons I’ve used, and the gears are great as well. I’ve got them pulling an M120, and I think they’re going to outlast all of the rest of the gun.</p>

</aside>
<p>I never hear anything bad about a VFC from anyone who knows what they’re talking about. The only time I hear anyone complain about their gearbox is when some idiot tries to upgrade it themselves, then blame the gearbox when they fail miserably.</p>
<p>As for the internals, they have a pretty interesting gearbox. It comes stock with a polycarbonate piston, with the 2nd to last tooth already removed for proper AoE with the gears, and beyond that I think the most notable thing is that their gears have a unique-to-VFC self-shimming system. From what I hear, the self-shimming gear set isn’t as great as a good re-shim from an experienced tech, but it works well in performance if you keep it stock, and it’s not like you can’t re-shim it yourself if you don’t like it. But anyway, the whole thing is easily upgradeable.</p>
<p>Plus, every time I try to buy a new VFC M4 (especially the E-series M4 and the Echo 1 Platinum M4) it goes out of stock. Those things are getting pretty popular… The Platinum Edition in particular I’ve been waiting on for at least a month now. :meh: … But that’s mostly in recent times… KWA M4’s have been around for much longer so that’s probably why you have more experience with them.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Da fu- … O_o 670 FPS? That thing can’t possibly be field legal. Most outdoor places don’t allow over 400 or so for an AEG. Hell, a lot of places don’t even allow over 550 or so for a SNIPER rifle.</p>

<p>And as for KWA, it’s more annoying to get replacement parts for them when they break since they don’t tend to follow TM spec. VFC can accept whatever stuff you want to throw into it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>From what I saw in the one I worked on, they seem to follow TM spec for the most part inside the gearbox, but outside is where the issues are. I can’t count the number of KWAs I’ve seen come to our booth with feeding issues due to incompatible magazines. I’ve never worked on a VFC though. Maybe that says something about the brand  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gas Blowback Rifles are pretty inconsistent in performance though, aren’t they?<br>
What about the (relatively) new King Arms M4 GBB?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It depends on the brand. I’ve never personally used or worked on a GBBR, but from what I’ve heard they’re pretty incredible when they do work. Overall, the most prominent issue with them is leaky magazines or internals. There’s a big difference between the GBBRs you see most people use and the DaytonaGuns/Asahis I’ve seen used in person though.</p>
<p>I can’t say anything about King Arms’s guns since I’ve never used one or looked at one though. I like their midcaps though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>If you decide to go the internal upgrade route, I cannot recommend a gearset/piston more than the AIM Monster Infinity torque gear set. I have a rifle firing 550 FPS with a .25 (That’s like 670 or so with a .20, which is what you commonly see listed online) and the gears and piston from this set have held up perfectly for a few years of heavy play now. For $50. Any upgrades on my or my team’s guns use this gear set as it seems to be indestructible even in high torque environments. <a href="https://www.airsoftpost.com/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=71&amp;products_id=29527" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.airsoftpost.com/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=71&amp;products_id=29527</a></p>
<p>Then drop any M130 spring in, and maybe add a better motor. Use a 9.6v battery or higher if you’re not already. That’ll put you right at 425 FPS for about $80-$90 in upgrades. Do all this to a boneyard gun (most of the time the issue is a stripped piston or gear) and you can have a pretty amazing weapon for like $200, max.</p>
<p>But all that is if you decide to take the “harder” route.</p>

</aside>
<p>Mechanical blowback in AEGs usually works by having a tow hook that is pulled back by the piston that also pulls back the bolt. It has no affect on FPS, and usually additional mechanical strain is pretty minimal. I’ve got an Ares G36C with a tow hook blowback system, it just adds a bit of fun to shooting. Rate of fire difference is almost nothing and even after a year the piston and gears held up just fine.</p>

<p>The L85 accepts STANAG-type magazines so you’re in luck since there are a lot of those out there. Plus they’re easier to carry, IMO. Would you prefer hicaps or midcaps?</p>

(they make all black versions as well)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know about Combat Machines. Electric Blowback guns are kind of pointless in my opinion since the moving bolt mechanism just adds to the number of things that can possibly break on your gun. Electric Blowbacks in general tend to consume battery and sometimes even FPS since it needs to operate another moving part, and for a minuscule benefit of barely added “realism”. I’ve heard that G&amp;G Combat Machines do tend to avoid the battery consumption and FPS drop though, due to the unique way that the bolt is attached to the gearbox.</p>
<p>And if you’re willing to spend $380 on a SCAR, then I would pick VFC over the G&amp;G: <a href="https://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?cPath=408_419&amp;products_id=3886" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?cPath=408_419&amp;products_id=3886</a></p>
<p>VFC is well-known for their top quality SCARs (I can personally vouch for this because I have one), and G&amp;G from what I’ve heard does not make as good internals as VFC. HOWEVER, if you want the FN F2000 then G&amp;G is pretty much the only way to go since they’re the only company that actually makes them as far as I know. Correct me if anyone else makes them.</p>

<p>Also, I would advise against buying a China clone or rebrand as a first gun. If you want a SCAR or F2000 and you’re willing to spend a lot of money you should really get something like a G&amp;G<br>

<p>Well if you were to buy a cheap gun like a JG or something, then be willing to do the research to find out which upgrade parts you want to buy in addition to the gun (tightbore barrel, gears, hopup bucking, bushings, piston, spring, some shims, etc), plus some gear grease and lubricants, then it could cost you either slightly less, or around the same (depending on which parts you get). Haven’t tried it myself though, but I mean to learn eventually.</p>
<p>Gearbox internals tend to be much cheaper than gun externals though. But in your case, I would much rather just pick something that performs well stock right out of the box, and wait for it to break later in the long run before attempting gearbox work. That way, you won’t have to mess around before you start shooting, and you’ll still be able to have room for upgrades in the future.</p>

</aside>
<p>I personally don’t know much about Red Ryders, except that they tend to be gravity-fed, or so I found out last time I read up on them. I’ve heard things about the inaccuracy of Red Ryders, and that they’re mostly just for plinking cans and stuff like that. Metal BBs tend to do significantly more damage though, especially if they match the velocity of airsoft guns. I doubt that they’d be allowed in an Airsoft match, unless you’re talking about a backyard battle, and even then, Metal BBs pose risks due to their ability to break and/or shatter eye protective gear. Not to mention that they would hurt a lot more.</p>
<p>Pellet guns are only really good for plinking. When I fire them the pellets tend to squash on impact unless they’re hitting plastic (like Legos), in which case they either embed themselves into the plastic, or leave a nasty mark. Produces a pretty neat effect, actually.</p>

<p>Hmm, I’ve always wondered what they did to the gearbox. I knew they slapped in their own motor and did something else to the internals but E1 hasn’t really been too specific and I never really bothered to find out what they changed other than the motor (they even change the motor for their VFC OEM guns for some reason…)</p>

<p>I’ve heard bad things about CA internals. I don’t really hear of a lot of people getting CA guns anymore though, but from what I hear they used to be much more popular. Maybe it’s just who I hear from.</p>

<p>As for a recommendation, as someone who does a lot of custom work himself, a cheaper gun such as an Echo 1 or Jing Gong plus internal upgrades is a no-brainer.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well for a starter, I doubt self-tech work would be a great option unless they’d be willing to learn gearbox work along with the normal startup phase. That’s why I would’ve rather gotten VFC in this scenario; it’s good for the price and works well stock.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And as for KWA, it’s more annoying to get replacement parts for them when they break since they don’t tend to follow TM spec. VFC can accept whatever stuff you want to throw into it.</p>

<p>Gas Blowback Rifles are pretty inconsistent in performance though, aren’t they?<br>
What about the (relatively) new King Arms M4 GBB?</p>

<p>I’d spend 400 dollars total.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh then that would give you plenty of room to maneuver. ~$270 more or less for a gun, plus maybe $20 to $30 for a battery and maybe $30 - $35 for a charger. That gives you some room for maybe extra mags and gear if you want (including eyepro).</p>
<p>If you do happen to need to go battery shopping, I would suggest an Intellect battery (voltage depending what rate of fire and size of battery you want) and some kind of smart charger so that you don’t accidentally destroy your battery while charging it.</p>
<p>Why don’t you look around the sites and see what you like? Ultimately it’s up to you since you would probably know what style you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the time, the only reason to get Echo 1 guns is the warranty (30 days manufacturer’s warranty by Echo 1 isn’t a bad deal at all). Echo 1 doesn’t actually make their own guns; the vast majority of their guns are bought from cheap Chinese companies like JG and CYMA, and then sold for a higher price. JG is their main supplier, and CYMA makes their AKs. The Echo 1 SCAR (aka ASC) is made by DBoys. Granted, that doesn’t necessarily mean the guns are all bad, it’s just that you could get essentially the same gun directly from the Chinese companies like JG and CYMA for a cheaper price. But like I said, if you do go that route then you probably won’t get as good a warranty.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I never really cared much about the warranty. Back when I couldn’t just fix it myself, the local store matched their warranty with any gun purchased from them, but nowadays I could build these things from scratch given the parts so a warranty just costs me money shipping it to the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Echo 1 does rebrand their guns but I will note that rebranded Jing Gongs at least get a different gearbox shell, metal bushings instead of JG’s plastic ones, and a different motor. This is observed from personal disassembly, repair, maintenance, etc.</p>

<p>EDIT: And not all E1 guns are cheap plastic either. Plenty of them are full metal. I myself own a full metal Echo 1 MP5.</p>
<p>EDIT2: And as I mentioned above, if the Echo 1 gun was originally manufactured by VFC then not only will it be full metal, but it will perform great and you will have absolutely no problem with it. Plus the warranty, don’t forget that. The Echo 1 Platinum Edition M4 in particular is a great deal since it’s OEM by VFC which means solid internals and externals, plus it comes as a package with a hard carrying case, 1 hicap and 1 midcap magazine, a crane stock, a black flash hider, and if you get it from <a href="http://AirsoftGI.com" rel="nofollow noopener">AirsoftGI.com</a>, you’ll also get a RIS included. If you were to buy all of those items separately, it would cost way more than what they price it for. (And don’t forget the warranty)</p>

            <p>So that rules out most SMG style AEGs. So a rifle.</p>
<p>And you prefer Bullpup style rifles? Hmm… See, bullpup in the Airsoft market is relatively limited unless you wanna risk getting lower quality guns or you’re willing to pay over your budget…</p>
<p>If you were to not care as much about it, what model guns would you want?</p>
<p>EDIT: How about an AUG? <a href="https://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?cPath=139_24_91&amp;products_id=1908" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?cPath=139_24_91&amp;products_id=1908</a></p>
<p>Doesn’t come with a battery or charger though unfortunately. If you add a battery + charger you’d probably go over $300.</p>
<p>How much are you willing to spend on items other than the gun?</p>
<p>And where do you plan to get the AUG shipped to? Because if it’s outside the US you’d have to find a different website (Airsoft GI doesn’t ship outside the US, and all of Evike’s AUGs are out of stock unfortunately).</p>

<p>Ok so now that I bothered to click the link since I couldn’t get to it before, I would take the time to tell you that the Echo 1 SCAR-H (ASC-H) is made by DBoys. That means crap quality pot metal and non amazing internals. Also as a side note, the folding stock doesn’t stay folded on that particular gun for some strange reason. I think the latch that is supposed to keep it folded just isn’t built to engage or something.</p>

<p>Ok so now that I bothered to click the link since I couldn’t get to it before, I would take the time to tell you that the Echo 1 SCAR-H (ASC-H) is made by DBoys. That means crap quality pot metal and non amazing internals. Also as a side note, the folding stock doesn’t stay folded on that particular gun for some strange reason. I think the latch that is supposed to keep it folded just isn’t built to engage or something.</p>
<p>If you really want it though I won’t stop you. After all, you’ll be getting the warranty if it breaks within 30 days, heh.</p>
