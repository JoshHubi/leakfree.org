    <title>L4D2 vpk crash upon map startup</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/l4d2-vpk-crash-upon-map-startup/2998</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have been designing a L4D2 map and have tested it quite extensively, but there is a huge problem. 
I am able to play my map with no problem when i load it up from the console. [i]But[/i] when i pack it in a vpk and try to run it from either the menu or the console, it crashes the game upon startup.


here is some info that may help:
-my entdata for the map is 122% (but the map still compiles, loads, and runs just fine. aside from the current issue)
-my map name is l4d2_hallowed_winter (I&#39;m providing this because im not sure if the length of the name or whatever is an issue for the vpk)
-when i package my vpk it adds a [i]thumbs.db[/i] file into the vpk. I dont know why or what its purpose is, as i dont see it in any other vpks, nor any of my previous ones.

None of my other vpks crash or have issues, so this has got me confused. My mission file is setup fine and so is my addoninfo. I have also done the stringtabledictionary command in the console.

If anyone has any ideas on what the problem may be, you would help me a ton.



[b]Edit:

I just recieved a response on a different forum and my problem was solved. It was because i was using models which had dx80s and sw.vtx files, so i had to remove them for the map to work.[/b]</description>

<p>How can you tell what are dx8.0 models? Also, what are sw.vtx files. I’m having the same crash as you. I’m mapping in Alien Swarm (which is a similar engine type as L4D2), and I did put in some TF2 models. When I get to them in one map, my game seems to crash - only when the map has been compressed into a vpk.</p>
