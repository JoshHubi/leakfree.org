<p>This is true, but as you said, almost every single government in the world is rife with corruption. And I don’t see anyone talking shit about their leaders at the moment.<br>
Basically, it’s because he’s dead. He died, and he was a socialist, so people feel the need to say shit like “I’m glad he’s dead” and “about fucking time” like he was Adolf Stalin-Bin-Laden. He wasn’t a bad person, he made some bad decisions, people under him did as well. Just because someone’s not a capitalist doesn’t automatically make them the <span class="bbcode-b">Enemy Of Freedom™</span></p>
<p>I’m just sick and tired of people doing shit like this all the time over petty differences like political views. If you uncover evidence that he murdered babies and raped women every day, then I’ll agree with the sentiments. But until you can prove they were, in fact, an immoral person, please don’t say it’s a <span class="bbcode-i">good</span> thing somebody died.</p>
<p>Just a bit of food for thought; If the president of, say, France died, there would be a lot less people on the burning effigies bandwagon, simply because of the politics. And the ones that <span class="bbcode-i">were</span> on it would ALL be from France and neighboring countries they deal with regularly.</p>

<p>I hate him because he blatantly rigged elections and had the oposition shut down. I don’t care if you’re corrupt, but undermining free-speech is crossing the line for me. Also he was so populist that he felt he needed to donate money to other countries and praise even the smallest thing that agreed with him. Even if it didn’t have to do anything with him.</p>
<p>By the way, our president is a short-armed incopetent jinx that for some reason rules the country. Seriously, not even Pinochet had an approval rating so low.</p>

<p>Probably since those “commie bastards” had the nerve to take our country in a fair election and it doesn’t sit well with the US and the rest of the world.

<p>*Venezuela, Castro is the Cuban dictator. He did some censorship crap, as already mentioned. Good that Chavez is gone, but whenever one roach dies, five more spring up. Best hope the successor isn’t as bad as he was, but if he’s “good” enough to be called Chavez’s successor, than you may be in some deep shit. Best wishes.</p>
