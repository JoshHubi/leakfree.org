    <title>My custom Xen map has very low FPS</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-custom-xen-map-has-very-low-fps/62007</link>
    <description>Well,it isn&#39;t fully my map. I&#39;m actually trying to update HECU_MARINE&#39;s Xen map and also fix some bugs. The framerate is unplayable and I always get error code 1 on VVIS. I have an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU and a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1060 GPU. It&#39;s also probably my fault. Help please!</description>

            <p>In the “Map” menu, click “Load Portalfile” and see if anything comes up. If you get a file window, close that and try “load pointfile”. This will show you if you have any leaks or other optimization anomalies in the map.</p>
