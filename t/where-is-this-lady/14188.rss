    <title>Where is  this Lady?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/where-is-this-lady/14188</link>
    <description>When I saw the trailer for Black Mesa Source saw this scientific . But the game never found women of color, or other races. (I apologize if my writing is not good, I do not want to offend refer to race or skin color someone)
 When I saw the trailer I thought I would find a woman of color.
 Perhaps she is the wife of Eli Vance?

I had found Asian and colored women, I thought it was an official version but I&#39;m wrong.

<p>100% sure of this, as the trailer was made before the Face Creation System was implemented. Though it would have been nice to have had some head submodels based off the trailer ones to use <span class="bbcode-i">with</span> the FCS, for extra variation.</p>
<p>As for racial variation among the female staff, There are some additional skins for the female scientist model. but they never appear in game because there aren’t any face presets using them - likely a result of the fact that you don’t encounter a very large amount of female scientists in the game.</p>

<p>It’d be nice if they were used in some of the random definitions so they could appear in custom maps, but even doing that, the non-white skins wouldn’t appear during the main game because IIRC every female scientist in the game uses their own specific preset face.</p>
