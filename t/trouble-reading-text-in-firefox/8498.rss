    <title>Trouble reading text in FireFox</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/trouble-reading-text-in-firefox/8498</link>
    <description>Not sure if this is something significant or i&#39;m just making a silly random observation but i&#39;ve been having some problems with reading text in FireFox.

i&#39;m still using a low-resolution CRT and assumed there was something wrong with my monitor. So i took a screenshot of the fuzzy text i&#39;m having trouble with, pasted it in MSPaint, blew it up and lo and behold; BLUE and ORANGE pixels.

it seems like a LOT of websites now are displaying text in scaled blue and orange instead of grey. Every site on the CheezBurger network is doing it, several blog sites i visit and even Google results are showing now in non-mono-chrome text. it&#39;s making my eyes BUG THE FUCK OUT. Most websites i frequent are fine and still easy to read, but just recently, i keep finding instances of multi-colored fonts; something i could SWEAR i&#39;ve never seen before.

is there something going on with how my software renders text or is this something that&#39;s been done since forever and i&#39;m just too dumb to have noticed?

            <p>What you’re seeing is Firefox’s implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">subpixel font rendering</a>.<br>
It’s meant to improve the readability of text on LCD monitors, but on CRTs (and LCDs running at a non-native resolution) it just looks terrible. Some people see the colour halos around the letters more easily than others and can find them distracting/unpleasant/painful to look at (even when the effect is displayed correctly).<br>
For some reason there doesn’t seem to be a way to disable it using the normal Firefox interface, but you could try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <span class="bbcode-b">about:config</span> into the address bar and press enter.</li>
<li>Find the setting <span class="bbcode-b">gfx.font_rendering.cleartype_params.rendering_mode</span> and change the value to <span class="bbcode-b">1</span>. If that doesn’t work, try some other values - hopefully one of them will look better than what you’re currently seeing; if not, set the value to <span class="bbcode-b">-1</span> (which is the default).</li>
</ol>

            <p>'cept im still using XP Pro.<br>
The change took place about a week or two ago. i didn’t make any changes to my font settings or updated FireFox either. it’s like it popped up overnight. Up until now i’ve only seen text rendered in one color scale (black/grey, blue, red, etc).</p>
<p>This text looks like it’s trying to appear 3D. Like with those old red and blue glasses.</p>

            <p>it’s W7’s improved font rendering, calibrating it helps to make it more readable if it’s not by default.</p>
