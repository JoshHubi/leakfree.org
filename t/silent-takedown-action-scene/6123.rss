            <p>its from the OP’s movie, limitbreak</p>
<p>i thought it was hilarious. one thing i can say is for a ‘silent takedown’ there sure wasn’t much silence. also, shooting a guy who doesn’t see you and is taking a piss? cold, man. don’t shoot a dude with his dick out.</p>

            <p>the damn views changed for way too many times for simple actions. 3 views for a tire falling comes into mind<br>
the composition of the scenes and editing weren’t that great<br>
also the switching between letterbox and fullscreen what the hell!!! white flashing OVER the letterboxes was kinda dumb and pointless. nothing should happen over the letterboxes(except maybe subtitles) if you use them<br>
i can say nothing of the acting, story or sound; i kinda skipped around the video and had music on.<br>
it’s p.intermediate on the aspects i can comment on. keep producing more, and try to practice composition! it’s important where the eye focuses!</p>

<p>Over all it was pretty good but i couldn’t stop noticing un-realistic acting and placement of objects.  A couple people reacted to bullet like they were hit with a BB gun.</p>
<p>The security cameras were VERY unrealistically placed.  They were ALWAYS placed in these specific locations that were aimed EXACTLY at one spot.  Like the one with the toilet.</p>

<p>Can you give some examples with annoying camera view changes?</p>
