            <p>This is why I thank God for developers like Valve and Remedy. Max Payne, Alan Wake, Half Life 2. All single player, all freaking awesome.</p>

<p>I agree, but should the devs take everything the players say to heart? No, they shouldn’t. They should think about whether the multiplayer is logical to include in the game or not. They shouldn’t include it just because a bunch of CoD fans scream for it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree with what you’re saying but unfortunately there is no way for us to adjust it. In some senses, if they need to make the game sell-able they do need to incorporate the cries of all parties to an extent, otherwise it would sell to 1 niche and that would be it. I can list off a mile long list of games that made an attempt at this and just fell through the cracks or got poor ratings simply because it didn’t have a run and gun MP attachment of some form.</p>
<p>The only real way to fix the game market is to introduce and support fresh blood in the market. People who have fresh ideas and have the same thoughts regarding MP that this forum obviously does minus a few.</p>

<p>Due to this article and interview with Pitchford, I am now even more interested in seeing what the new Aliens game will be like:</p>

            <p>hl1 had them combined.</p>
<p>Also hl2dm has suffered a lot due to not being associated with the singleplayer actually.</p>
<p>Up until the somewhat recent orange box update for all hl2 games, they hadn’t updated it in years despite all the bugs and lack of updated features it has, and it still has major bugs, a lot of which were introduced by switching to orange box engine.</p>
<p>HL2DM wasn’t even as updated as CSS.</p>

            <p>Yes, but HL2DM is a classic example of Valve’s approach to gaming. I.e. Single versus multi. If HL2 had come bundled with HL2DM, it probably wouldn’t have suffered much, but being seperate, they are free to do their own thing and excel at it, rather than suffer the limitations of each other. Valve don’t seem to mix the two types of games very much. That said, it will be interesting to see how the co-op in Portal 2 works, as they have essentially combined SP and MP into one package.</p>

            <p>I must admit, I enjoy hl2dm myself and hl2 didn’t come with a dm out of the box.</p>
<p>The multiplayer versions of games should at least keep the fundamental gameplay mechanics to keep things interesting.</p>

            <p><span class="mention">@mankyman</span>: I kind of agree with you there. UT3 campaign in so generic that the highlight of it is the Necris invasion movie. Yes, the highlight is a non-interactive scene. In a game. Come on Epic, you can do better than that.<br>
I also wouldn’t mind them making a bit effort with their bots in UT. Every single bot of every single UT game is nothing but a mobile aimbot.</p>
<p>UT99 Loque: Derp, insta headshot you through a tiny gap, from across the map, the instant you appeared, while I was noscoped and jumping sideways.<br>
UT2K4 Matrix: Derp, insta headshot you through a tiny gap, from across the map, the instant you appeared while I was noscoped, double wall dodging sideways.<br>
UT3 Akasha: Derp, insta head…you getting the idea yet? lol</p>
<p>Of course, this makes insta gib matches pure hell against AI any smarter than Experienced. It’s just so unnecessary to make every bot an aimbot who’s chances of hitting you are governed by what essentially amounts to an engine dice roll.</p>

<p>UT3 didn’t have much of a campaign, it was basically multiplayer with bots. I know Unreal 3 and UT3 are two separate things.</p>
<p>It’s hard to balance both single and multiplayer, even for Epic. Yes, their engine can do both pretty well but what does it matter when they don’t put forth the effort?</p>
<p>Also, I still stand by my claim that both GoW multiplayers were boring. Gears is a series that I can honestly say that would do better without multiplayer.</p>

            <p>The original unreal was an amazing game. It’s one of those games with an epic single player, and the weapons/mechanics to make an epic multiplayer as well. That’s why they made UT to begin with, because the Unreal multi worked so well.</p>
<p>Thing is, now epic only does UT, GOW, and haphazardly made Unreal 2. The Unreal series is their staple, what their fucking engine is named after, but still there has not been any true successor to Unreal 1.</p>

            <p>My apologies mankyman, but I was initially referring to the UT series rather than GoW. But both stand as good examples of what I meant.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@fridge</span>: You mean like they did for the GOTY of the first game?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Damn it’s terrible lol.</p>

<p>I honestly find all of this to be repulsive. Yeah, everyone who has posted before me is absolutely right in the fact that the game devs and pubs arent happy with a game till it sells as many as modern warfare, but at the same time, it’s the players that fuel the obsession. I can’t begin to count how many gamers i’ve spoken to about bioshock (for example) that go “that game was fuckin stupid.” and when i ask them why they say something stupid like “there was nothing to do after i got bored with the storyline. It needed a multiplayer.”</p>
<p>While it’s not the entire gaming community that conforms to this consensus, it’s generally the group of people who obsessively play CoD… the ones that don’t care that it’s storyline is shitty and predictable and only want to “lozl pwn” some newbs with their famas or some shit. But i totally agree, even if you were to make a game with just SP elements you would still turn a profit. Look at bioshock.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree, but should the devs take everything the players say to heart? No, they shouldn’t. They should think about whether the multiplayer is logical to include in the game or not. They shouldn’t include it just because a bunch of CoD fans scream for it.</p>

            <p>Deus Ex 3 is looking promising for those that want a rich single player narrative experience. To slap a MP component on a DX game would be an obvious cash grabbing attempt and an insult to the series, which is why I’m glad they chose to focus soley on the SP.</p>

<p>The topic isn’t whether the MP is/was boring as hell, but rather that developers/publishers are slapping on shitty multiplayer because it makes it more like CoD, detrimenting the SP and overall quality of the game. Something which hasn’t happened with GoW…yet.</p>
<p>As for the Bulletstorm MP: I have tried it on XBL. It’s terrible, absolutely terrible. Netcode is shit, constant connection problems, constant dropping from games, plus you need to actually form a team with someone you can communicate with, otherwise you will inevitably fail the MP.<br>

<p>I was replying to your comment where you stated that Epic Games makes good  single player and multiplayer. I disagreed, but I didn’t feel like quoting your entire comment. I won’t make the same mistake twice. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>I do agree, however, that many companies are placing multiplayer in their games haphazardly in the hopes of being a CoD killer. This is all for naught, for the people who have been dedicated to CoD for this long will not change their loyalties on a dime, so what’s the point in trying? CoD is what they like and it is what they will always choose when they want to play an arcade shooter.</p>
<p>Companies need to really think about whether they’re trying to make their multiplayer to be a CoD killer, or if their making it because it would go well with the game as a whole. They need to stop looking at CoD and start looking at themselves and start asking, “Are we really going to stoop that low?” :hmph:</p>
