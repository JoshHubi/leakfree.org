    <title>Been messing around with CS:GO SDK</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/been-messing-around-with-cs-go-sdk/9312</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working on this for about a week. Yeah, I&#39;m slow. Anyways, I&#39;m pretty new to SDK and most of the time that I&#39;ve logged in SDK is during this project. Looking for some feedback, and ideas. 

Steam screenshots of the project:
