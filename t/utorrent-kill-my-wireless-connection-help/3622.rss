    <title>uTorrent kill my wireless connection. HELP!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/utorrent-kill-my-wireless-connection-help/3622</link>
    <description>i&#39;ve Googled the hell out of every query i can come up with. i&#39;m hoping to get some helpful advice here. For maximum understanding, i will be dispense information in the form of...

...BULLET POiNTS!![/SIZE]


* My router is a Linksys WRT54G
My wireless adapter on my PC is a Linksys USB54G
BOTH of which have worked fine until i reinstalled WinXP SP3 (from SP2)
* The connection drops randomly or on cue 2-3 minutes after i start up utorrent
* All other PCs on my network stay online, both internet and intranet
To reconnect my PC, i have to unplug and replug the router -
(renewing ip and/or removing and reconnecting usb adapter does nothing)
* Oddly enough, both Windows and Linksys Monitor show &quot;CONNECTED&quot; -
(their status never changes for some reason)
* i&#39;ve tried disabling firewalls(s) - no dice
* i&#39;ve disabled all other network connections -
(wired, onboard wireless, firewire) - no go
* i&#39;ve disabled all unnecessary applications, processes, etc. - still no luck
* i spent a good hour or two tweaking utorrent ports, forwarding and limits - no improvement
* There&#39;s no reason why my cordless phone should suddenly start causing enough interference to kill my desktop but not enough to knock off my laptop, PS3, Wii, etc.
* ...OH! ...and i can play PS3 for hours upon hours with no drop!
The problem is with my wireless network, not my internet service provider. There is no fair access policy or bandwidth limit. The issue lies between my router and my PC.
* On occasion, my connection drops without utorrent being a factor!
* There is no pattern or consistency between times the connection drops. No consistency between time of day, bandwidth usage, websites visited, games played, etc.
* ...and as usual, i need to unplug and replug the router to fix it.
it&#39;s getting to the point that i&#39;m considering buying one of [url=&#39;https://www.amazon.com/Lamson-HW1190-Outdoor-Remote-Control/dp/B0000TI5JY/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hi&amp;qid=1270234353&amp;sr=1-4&#39;]these[/url] because i&#39;m getting sick of running back and forth across the house to reset the router.



The solution is probably the simplest...so be gentle. My concern in relation to this particular forum is that i hope to download and play BM via torrent (if available).

            <p>…because sometimes its not possible to have a wired connection?</p>
<p>Anyway I have a similar problem. I often leave uTorrent on overnight for seeding, and a couple of times I noticed that once I woke up in thee morning, my wireless connection dissappeared completely (although Windows accurately said that it was disconnected; I don’t know why yours doesn’t do that).</p>
<p>I have FiOS, and Verizon just replaced my modem. We’ll see if the problem is fixed.</p>

            <p>High volume wireless traffic will kill the wireless connectivity of my mother’s Linksys WCG200 v2. This includes torrents. Even zealously capping the speed of transfer will only delay its disconnection.</p>
<p>Occasionally YouTube has this effect. Or even this forum when I open the Screen Shot (or another high-bandwidth) thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are those other computers (unaffected) hooked up wirefully using ethernet? (In my case, wired computers are not affected.)</li>
<li>Can you access your modem’s gateway once it stops relaying internet? (In my case, I can still access 192.160.0.1 or whatever it’s set to. Check your gateway (Win+R, “cmd”, enter, “ipconfig”, enter) and see if it comes up after you’re disconnected from the internet.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If this matches your problem, I haven’t found a solution. Some users spoke of firmware rollbacks, or firmware updates. I can not confirm either solution as the firmware to this router-modem hybrid is directly tamperable by the ISP and ISP only.</p>
<p>If you <span class="bbcode-b">can</span> still access the router’s gateway, I have discovered a way to ease your pain from afar each time it drops… visit the gateway, and change the gateway address. (For example, change 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.2)<br>
This <span class="bbcode-u">will cause the modem to reset itself, remotely</span>, in order to compensate for the change. Next time you go to reset it this way, change it back to .1 so you can simply toggle back and forth.</p>
<p>If this is not identical to your problem, I apologize and wish you the best. Linksys is still better than NetGear.</p>
