            <p>Imagine that Valve had finally finished producing the new SDK/hammer toolset to make it easy for both developers and the community to work with. Now hold on to that image, and to validate the tools effectiveness, they speed-develop the original levels of HL1 from memory and from scratch. If they managed to finish the game within a certain time, they give it to the community for free. If they don’t, then Ep3 is delayed further till the toolset is ready to be shipped alongside the game. HL1 and Ep3 is then shipped together as a special edition boxset</p>

<p>Valve is not going to work on remaking HL1. They were just asked about remaking it and they said that even though it’d be fun, they won’t do it. Atleast not any time soon. Like Gabe said, they’re moving forward AKA working on Ep3 and maybe later on HL3. And you wishing HL3 before Ep3 disappoints me. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

            <p>The original Half-life is a classic, pc-gamers should’ve at least played it once in their lifetime. It isn’t all about graphics, the atmosphere in hl1 is one of the best you ever experience in a game imo.</p>

            <p>Agreed.  I suggest playing HL1 before Black Mesa because you get to see it and why it became so awesome that the devs wanted to create Black Mesa in the first place.  You’re missing a major piece of the puzzle if you just play Black Mesa and it won’t be as fun.  If you don’t play it, how do you know that Black Mesa will be better?</p>
<p>But, it’s your decision.  I think I’ll go back and play some HL1 again (yes, it’s that awesome).</p>

<p>lol No it won’t be. I’m sure BM will be great for a mod but HL1 will always be the classic.</p>
<p>I’d suggest to not be stubborn and actually play it. If not, like that guy up there said, your loss.</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t really want valve working on an HL1 remake anyways. I’ve waited long enough for Black Mesa, i don’t want to have to wait for another 5 years just to see valves re-imagining.</p>
<p>Valve should focus on the portal 3’s and episode 3’s of the world.</p>

            <p>I know what happens in the original Half Life, but I haven’t played and and I’m not going to.</p>
<p>I’d rather play BM. It’s going to be way better than the original.</p>

<p>Well, there is a possibility to get some info starting from Portal 2 please, and prior to E3. But, I’m afraid, Valve will show Dota 2 on E3 <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> .</p>
