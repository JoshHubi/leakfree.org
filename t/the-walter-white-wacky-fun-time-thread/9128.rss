    <description>Do we have a Breaking Bad thread yet? I don&#39;t think we do. But I can see a need for a place to kinda dump all of our BB related shit and discussion. (So, spoilers.)

First of all, if you haven&#39;t seen Breaking Bad yet, I highly recommend it, and I&#39;m sure many others on the forums do too. It follows the misadventures of a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with lung cancer and sets out to make some money for his family by cooking meth. Somewhat simple premise, but it evolves into so much more over the course of its run.

Currently, Breaking Bad is four episodes into its fifth and final season. Seasons 1-4 are available for streaming if you have a Netflix WI subscription. If you want an excellently crafted story, compelling characters, and a disturbingly accurate depiction of the methamphetamine business, start watching immediately.

---

That being said, who&#39;s been watching season 5? Anybody starting to form some horrifying idea of how it&#39;s all gonna end?</description>

            <p>I just got word that the final episodes of Breaking Bad’s fifth season will be in the style of a sitcom.</p>
<p>Hank’s prying, now that he has a driving suspicion, will lead to a lot of laughs when he goes through extreme measures to find nothing of interest (since Walt is finally retired). There will also be some touching moments as Junior transitions to adulthood under the roof of his reunited parents. Otherwise, expect the usual laughs as we get a chance to better know a married couple and their relatives.</p>

            <p>I actually thought he was going to try and smuggle the ricin in to prison and get his guys on the inside to slip it into their food. But then I realised the logistics of that would be far more complicated than just shanking everyone.</p>

            <p>I saw a cool theory about the Walt Whitman book browsing the AV Club comments on the episode. Thought I’d post it here.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="Brooklynrocks">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 Brooklynrocks:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s what I think no one is getting.  Gale didn’t give the book to Walt.  That’s my guess anyway.  We never actually saw Gale giving him the book.  That’s the impression they wanted to leave, but I think it was an intentionally misleading impression.</p>
<p>Gale and Walt talked about Leaves of Grass, and then we see Walt reading it.  But we don’t see Gale giving it to Walt.  I think Walt had it already.  If you noticed, it looked like a pretty old book; not something Gale would have bought recently and given to Walt (and he certainly wouldn’t give Walt his only copy).</p>
<p>Who gave it to him, then?  Gretchen.  I had to google it, but Gretchen’s maiden name was Black.  Therefore also G.B.</p>
<p>And the inscription makes sense.  And when Walt chuckles when he reads it, he’s not chuckling while thinking of Gale; it’s a rueful chuckle when he thinks about how he used to work with Gretchen at Gray Matter.</p>
<p>This also explains why Walt wouldn’t destroy this book as he did the other evidence of his crimes; Gretchen gave it to him, he knows that, and doesn’t think twice about it.</p>
<p>And so the big irony; Hank figures out who Walt is via a clue that shouldn’t even have been a clue to begin with.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Interesting theory.</p>

            <p>I think its necessary to make sure viewers aren’t still sympathizing with him.  Walter White really isn’t in shades of gray anymore.  He is pretty much a bad man.</p>
<p>Edit: Also this reminded me of how I can’t look forward to more of Mike next year :’( <a href="https://blogs.amctv.com/breaking-bad/2012/08/jonathan-banks-interview.php?utm_campaign=AMC_BB_9.4.12&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_source=MarketTraq&amp;utm_term=213841" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://blogs.amctv.com/breaking-bad/2012/08/jonathan-banks-interview.php?utm_campaign=AMC_BB_9.4.12&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_source=MarketTraq&amp;utm_term=213841</a></p>

            <p>It may be a realistic depiction, but 9 stabbings + 1 burning over the course of two minutes is a bit extreme.<br>
(IDK how long the montage was, going by Walter’s time frame he gave Todd’s uncle)</p>

<p>Hey guys, over here in the US, we do this stuff for shits-n-giggles… everyone here likes to partake in a nice old-fashioned shankfest every now and again… but yes, this was pretty brutal shit, even by our standards.</p>
<p>Fridge, you were not privy to launch?.. you and Ram aren’t mates?.. aren’t you guys mere miles away from each other?</p>

<p>Its not all that violent, as it isn’t violence for the sake of it.  Its a realistic portrayal of prison murders especially when they want to make sure they work out.  I don’t know how realistic the fire scene was though.  Its to show that Walter now does this without remorse.</p>
