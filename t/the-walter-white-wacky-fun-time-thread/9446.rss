<p>We’re you honestly expecting any different? He got his death sentence at the beginning, and with the nature of the show you couldn’t think he was just gonna lose the cancer.</p>
<p>But regardless, this was such a great show, I don’t think there was ever a bad episode, and it was wrapped up incredibly nicely. A1 series,  10/10.</p>

            <p>Its important to remember that his death was his choice.  Cancer was an inevitability but he died from a bullet wound that arguably could have been treated.  Cancer was another one of the things in his life he felt “was making his choices for him” or that he was “doing this for the family”.  But this ending was important in showing that through his stupid small man complex meth empire he realized he was making his own choices and the evil he had done he had liked.</p>
<p>Its interesting how this didn’t end with the crime doesn’t pay ending despite death (in fact arguably this isn’t even a downside death was the ending since ep 1).  In the end Walt probably manages to get his son through college and help his family.  He saves Jesse from his enslavement and hopefully he goes on to pursue his dream of woodworking.  Jesse also learned a lot from Walt.  His ability to make 90% meth shows this.  He doesn’t live to see himself demonized and gets his revenge.</p>

            <p>We’re you honestly expecting any different? He got his death sentence at the beginning, and with the nature of the show you couldn’t think he was just gonna lose the cancer.</p>
<p>But regardless, this was such a great show, I don’t think there was ever a bad episode, and it was wrapped up incredibly nicely. A1 series,  10/10.</p>

            <p>Gotta say, I was impressed by how they tied it all up. Excellent show beginning to end, and that’s a rare thing.</p>
