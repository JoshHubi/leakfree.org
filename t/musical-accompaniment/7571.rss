In my oppinion, black mesa is the most strong and promising project of all of i could seen.
So, my question is: [u]Can you let me make some soundtrack for black mesa source?[/u]:zip:
Here is some of my created previews

            <p>Like everyone else said.</p>
<p>Though the previews you gave are boomboxing.  You could always make the soundtrack to my life, or at least the soundtrack to me playing Black Mesa: Source.</p>

            <p>Sounds pretty good, but they are too late in development to take it. I’m sure there a lot of other mods that would be glad for your help.</p>

            <p>You could always mod the game and replace the music with your own.</p>

            <p>Sounds good to me, but as was already said, black mesa already has a composer and besides, its a little late in the game to ask if you can be apart of the mod.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa already has a talented composer, Joel Nielsen, that is doing the sound track and audio for the game. At this stage I would assume that most of the sound work is complete, but thanks for your interest anyway. Here is Joel’s website:</p>
