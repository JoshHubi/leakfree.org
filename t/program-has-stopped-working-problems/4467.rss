    <title>&quot;program has stopped working&quot; problems</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/program-has-stopped-working-problems/4467</link>
    <description>Okay, a little while ago my pc started giving my the &quot;[program name] has stopped working&quot; errors for multiple programs, these are: Internet explorer, DAP, windows action center (Windows Explorer has stopped working), AVG download manager, AVG Setup, and few others. As well as all this I have been getting some BSOD crashes, which I believe are related to memory errors. I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a virus, but I scanned with windows defender and Malwarebytes&#39; Anti-Malware, they both found infected files, the files were removed and my pc was restarted, but the problems remain. Any help would be much appreciated. :smiley:</description>

            <p>Negative on the bad memory, it did crash with a BSOD detailing memory issues, but that was at start up and after a reboot it was fine and I was playing games with no problems. Like I said I haven’t had any REAL problems, just little annoying ones. I’m using Firefox now with no problems.</p>

            <p>Software related?</p>
<ul>
<li>bad/corrupt driver installation (try to reinstall basic Windows drivers, if this fails try to repair Windows. If this fails reinstall Windows)</li>
<li>virus (scan for virusses etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hardware related?</p>
<ul>
<li>memory overheating (can cause BSOD’s, but this should only happen when the system is under heavy load for example when you’re playing games)</li>
<li>bad memory timings/voltage/speed (<span class="bbcode-b">sticker on the side of the memory shows what timings/voltage/speed your memory requires</span>, set this in the BIOS. failure to do so can cause massive instability and BSOD’s - <span class="bbcode-b">many people forget to do this when they buy a new computer unless you have X.M.P memory</span>)</li>
<li>bad/damaged memory sticks that cause (silent) data corruption which completely messes up Windows (this can also happen when you’ve overclocked the sticks too much, test each memory stick individually with memtest)</li>
</ul>
<p>What does the BSOD say, does it stay and display information or does it go away in 1/4th of a second followed by a system reboot?</p>

            <p>Thanks guys! I already have Firefox and Opera as well as IE, I think it may be a service that isn’t working, probably an Internet related one, I think this because all the programs that stop working are Internet related in some way. Also, a lot of services have “stopped” when I check services tab. Thanks for the suggestions, but I think I can get used to not using IE or DAP, for now. If it gets any worse than I’ll look into it more, I just want to be sure if it’s a virus or not.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What operating system?</p>
<p>General steps to try in a case such as yours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download, install, and update Spybot Search &amp; Destroy</li>
<li>Update your Malwarebytes</li>
<li>Boot into Safe Mode (restart Windows, then repeatedly mash the F8 key until you get a boot manager, select “Safe Mode” and press Enter)</li>
<li>Once in Safe Mode, disable System Restore (right click on My Computer, select Properties, go to the System Restore tab [XP] or System Protection tab [Vista] and uncheck all your drives)</li>
<li>Then scan with Spybot and MBAM (full scans, not quick)</li>
<li>When both scans finish, fix/repair all problems, then restart Windows</li>
<li>Make sure Windows is updated</li>
<li>Download and install Firefox and stop using Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Download the installation file for Avira Antivir, then turn off your internet (yank out your Ethernet cable or turn off your wireless adapter), uninstall AVG, restart, install Avira Antivir, re-enable internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>If the problems persist after that, your options become slimmer - take it to a repair center or a friend who knows what they’re doing (if it’s not obvious, I do this frequently  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ), or reinstall Windows (after backing up any important files from your C: drive)</p>
<p>Hope that helps, keep us updated…</p>
