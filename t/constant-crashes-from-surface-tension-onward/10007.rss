    <title>Constant crashes - from Surface Tension onward</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/constant-crashes-from-surface-tension-onward/10007</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been having these issues ever since i reached the landmines area of the chapter. Ever since, if i take and throw a grenade, the game will crash right as the explosion will happen. As i proceeded i noticed that the problem was well extended to other things, such as:
- Helicopter explosion sequence from the cliff part of the chapter
- Tripmines explosion
- Hivehand projectiles
- The already mentioned grenades
- Barrels explosion, although this was very case-dependant

This also applies for enemies using them, thus it totally hinders any way for me to normally progress without just noclipping all the way.

If you need my Dxdiag, let me know and i&#39;ll upload that too</description>
