    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-on-osx-doesnt-launch/12879</link>
    <description>Hi, I have an iMac late 2012, intel core i7 3.4ghz, 16gb RAM, 1TB HD, GTX680 2GB VRAM...

I installed steam via winebottler and it works fine! I also installed black mesa with wine in the correct directory, it shows up in the menu and when I launched it for the first time it downloaded the source 2007 SDK..

but now that this has downloaded i wanted to launch it and it always shows me the same error:
