    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/h-e-v-hud-initializing-sequence/1420</link>
    <description>Idk if thread like this has been made... It would be cool when something like this will happen when we get HEV:
HEV:  Welcome to the H.E.V. mark 4 protective system. For use in hazardous environment conditions. 
(Just nice WELCOME text in center or lower left(or in chat)
HEV: &quot;Hi-Impact Reactive Armor activated&quot; 
(armor icon and status slowly appears)
HEV: &quot;Atmospheric contaminant sensors activated&quot; 
(all control symbols like biohazard and radiation are fastly flashing and dissappear)
HEV: &quot;Vital sign monitoring activated&quot; 
(health meter is fastly counting from 0 to 100 %)
HEV: &quot;Automatic medical systems engaged&quot; 
(cross (+) icon appears near health meter)
HEV: &quot;Defensive (wut?!) weapon selection system activated&quot; 
(maybe all slots flashing, there I haven&#39;t ideas)
HEV: &quot;Munition level monitoring activated&quot; 
(maybe place on screen where will be number of ammo will appear and dissappear, just for info)
HEV: &quot;Communications interface online&quot; 
(maybe chat field and Voice symbol (that from multi when you are talking))
HEV: &quot;Have a very safe day&quot;</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Over the years people have suggested hundreds, even thousands of little ideas that would make the mod a tiny bit cooler, in their opinions. If the devs implemented all of them, the mod would never get finished and would end up nothing like Half-Life any more anyway (this is known as ‘feature creep’, where the constant adding of pointless new features delays development needlessly and ‘creeps’ the project further and further away from it’s original goals). If you have an idea you’d like to suggest that doesn’t match something already done in the half-life series or in the Source engine and doesn’t add to or significantly improve the gameplay without straying too far from the original, then it needs to be either ridiculously easy to do, or massively cool, or preferably both.</p>
<p>It’s not up to the mods to give you reasons why they’re not using your idea, it’s up to you to make the best possible case for your idea, and if they still say no, to take it like a man and move on instead of whining about it. O[COLOR=‘Red’]n which note I’m closing this thread. The devs have seen your arguments and come to their own decision, there’s nothing more to be said now.</p>
<p>PS, for the BM veterans: above I actually started typing ‘creature feep’ and had to stop and think about it for a minute before I remembered the proper name. Damn you all. &lt;3  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>If Flatline is really Raminator, and banned Winged One for nothing, he could watch out.<br>
I will tear both Rammy and Flatline in real, not just forum &gt;=D I’m pretty harmful &gt;=3 cuz… rawr I’m lion.</p>
<p>Btw, why he have to be mad cuz of good (I think) idea, they had to polish up BM, and I think they have much more really serious things to do and won’t release BM for long. Tell me if it’s hard or laborious to do Mr Raminator, but I think cman2k could look at this idea, unless Raminator is great coder too. I’m really not asking for time button, which is playing some sounds in order to do sentence “The time is now: 2:40 AM” or something (oops, already asked) but for HUD modification, just one time in game, on start.</p>

<p>Yeah, small, practical and looks “awsum”  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  so why not if it will be simple to do? Just because this wasn’t existed in HL1? Wut? Is Black Mesa really copy of old HL1? Half Life: Source was it.</p>

<p>btw, about this, yes, I know we can’t suggets easter eggs, but console command, or better, secret button near HEV capsule which causing message like above will be funny xD of course with restart and then suit could work properly</p>
