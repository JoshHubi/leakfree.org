    <title>[SINGLEPLAYER] Player Death Sounds Not Playing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/singleplayer-player-death-sounds-not-playing/13959</link>
    <description>Two different death sounds for the player aren&#39;t working in singleplayer:

* [b]HEV Vox[/b]: The &quot;beeping flatline&quot; sentence sequence of the HEV suit voice isn&#39;t playing whenever the player dies, at any point during the game.
* [b]Falling Death[/b]: The crunching sound of the Player.FallGib effect isn&#39;t playing whenever the player dies from falling.  Instead, the normal &quot;non-death&quot; Player.FallDamage plays in its place.</description>
