    <title>Worlds greatest hack for source engine, possible?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/worlds-greatest-hack-for-source-engine-possible/7476</link>
    <description>Ok, I was thinking while I was playing counter-strike... I&#39;m fairly sure that (counting separation from client and server) it would be possible to teleport, and or stand on ground that is not there in a multi-player source game.

So the only things required for this hack to work would be the original map, a program on the client side that sends the original map to the server (upon server check of file version), then the loading of the *fake map. For the client to interact on. **The locations of the other players would be sent from the server to you, thus causing the players to show up in the fake map allowing them to be shot**.

*Fake map would consist of a cube of player clip and a skybox in the very far distance allowing any map to be enclosed.

**So my question is, Are the bullet hits registered on the client, or on the server? And does the map get checked constantly for tampering?</description>

            <p>I normally hate giving away my 1337 h4x, but who is crazy enough to go out and get 3 monitors just to have an unfair advantage for a split second…</p>
<p>I went back to 1 screen because I can’t overclock my CPU when I use the onboard graphics (which has 3 outputs), and because I don’t suck at the game</p>

            <p>Bullet hits are registered on the client, and then sent to the server as part of the lag compensation thing. And i don’t know for sure, but i doubt the map part would work.</p>
