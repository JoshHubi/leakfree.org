    <title>My screen doesn´t support the resolution.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-screen-doesn-t-support-the-resolution/9579</link>
    <description>Hello Black Mesa team and fans.
When I went to play Black Mesa I changed the resolution of the screen to the last option, but my screen doesn&#39;t support that resolution.
How I could change the screen resolution without run Black Mesa?
I tried delete the BMS folder in source mods and install Black Mesa again but doesn&#39; work.
I am waiting for your answers.
Thanks.

P.D.: Sorry if my English is bad.</description>

<p>lower the resolution in black mesa to what monitor can support, if your not sure what that is right click on your desktop and check the personalised options then adjust black mesa to the same.</p>
<p>also get a new monitor, im tipping yours is prehistoric if it cant support the 1920 x 1080p</p>
