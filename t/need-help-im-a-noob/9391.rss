    <title>Need help Im a noob</title>

    <description>Hi people

Since the mod is coming out soon I want to make sure I&#39;m ready to play it

It says here I need Source SDK 2007 and its free and I don&#39;t have to buy any games to get it.

But how do I get it?  (No Im not trolling)  Do I need to have Steam?  Can I get Source Sdk 2007 without steam?  I don&#39;t Need to buy any steam games?

I&#39;m a noob when it comes to PC being a console gamer for most of my Life

I first played Half Life 1 when it came out on PS2 when I was a little kid and Liked it

Now I hear Half Life 1 is back with New HD Graphics so I want to play it again

From the Pics and Vids I seen it look like Valve made it I almost Thought they did for a bit lol.

Anyways If anyone can Answer this extremly noob Question Thanks  :slight_smile:</description>
