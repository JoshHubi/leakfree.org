    <title>Brittish Locals - need advice on TV licensing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/brittish-locals-need-advice-on-tv-licensing/5408</link>
    <description>Okay, so I move to university accommodation in Leeds, and will be there for a short while, and i wanna watch some formula 1, preferably live.
Is it safe to watch iPlayer without the license? Did anyone of you try to simulcast without license?</description>

<p>Plus it’s not like I’m a Brittish national. And it’s not like I’m buying my laptop in UK. Bitches can’t trace me. So I guess it is:<br>

            <p>I had to look into this 'cus I’ve been in charge of arranging stuff for me and my mates who’ve moved off-campus after our first year:</p>
<p>To put it simply, if you’re watching something live, you need a TV licence, no matter how you watch it. However, I think it’s very hard for the TV licencing people to prove that you were watching it live if they were to try tracing it through IP addresses.</p>
<p>However, being a fellow F1 fan at uni, I’d definitely recommend watching it at the students’ union, because the atmosphere will be a lot better than by yourself in your room, and you get to meet other fans.</p>

<p>BBC iPlayer live requires a license. But programs uploaded onto the site, do not. But i can’t see them catching you.</p>

</aside>
<p>Do you have one, by the way? Or do you even watch TV?<br>
Did TVL ever pay you a visit? I heard those guys get on your nerves even if you don’t receive a TV signal.</p>
<p>Here’s some interesting stuff:<br>

<p>Not sure however if you can do this trick in Uni accomodation…</p>
<p>EDIT: WHAT THE FUCK. I’m sorry, but this is a complete bullshit:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>It used to be the case that televisions receiving a transmission from outside the UK (e.g. in Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey and the Netherlands via the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wiki/Astra_1A" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Astra satellite</a>, on which many channels are <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wiki/Free-to-air" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">free-to-air</a>) did not need a licence, but this was changed by the Communications Act (2003), so that the reception of television from any source requires a TV licence.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Say fucking what? I need to pay BBC for what they are not even broadcasting? On MY terestrial? On My TV?</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t see how can they track you by IP. Tuner - yes, but IP…</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>[align=left][color=white]John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons media select committee, said:In the past they have tackled evasion by sending threatening letters. But now they can’t just come in and say that’s your television, where’s your licence? How will they know what you’ve used your computer for?<br>
[color=white]The broadband companies who deliver the content say the technology does not enable the BBC to identify who is watching the shows, making enforcement virtually impossible.<br>
[color=white]When a viewer uses the iPlayer, the BBC receives the users unique IP address. To get a person’s name and address it would need access to the databases held by broadband suppliers, but they are obliged to protect customers’ privacy.<br>
[color=white]A spokeswoman for Tiscali, a major broadband company, said: The BBC would have no evidence of TV licence nonpayment and therefore would be asking us to pass over all customer data. It would be legally and morally unacceptable.<br>
[color=white]A spokesman for BT said: We don’t give customer information out. We don’t do it for file sharing and music piracy, and we wouldn’t do it for the BBC. They have to come to us with a court order and an IP address. Then and only then would we divulge an individual’s details.[/align]</p>

<p>My flatmate used to watch live streams from iPlayer and we didn’t have a licence. As far as I’m aware you won’t get caught. However, I could be totally wrong. So don’t go getting fined over what someone on the internet told you.</p>
