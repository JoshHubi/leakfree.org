It should look and feel much more like a proper PC title after applying them. Just copy and paste the command into the launch options area of the crysis 2 mp demo steam launcher, or if you are launching from a shortcut, just put this at the end of the target line.

            <p>That wouldn’t be a problem for Crytek or EA. They already miscalculated the bandwidth forecast. That’s why people could download the demo with more than 2,5mb/s but then couldn’t create their game accounts. That was already stated by Crytek.</p>

</aside>
<p>the problem there was, was the leaked beta and everybody talked about it. crytek hasn’t the pc demo ready at this time. to stop talking about the beta, crytek gave a fast converted PC-demo to the people. that crytek didn’t say itself, but german sites like <a href="http://gamestar.de" rel="nofollow noopener">gamestar.de</a> - but it is just a matter of fact that the demo IS a console-port, it IS, what crytek said. they said this because most people were disappointed about the quality of the demo. for me personally: i like the gfx-quality of the demo.</p>
<p>believe it or not. and now let’s wait for the finished game, or what!</p>

            <p>I don’t even understand how Crysis 2 could be ported from consoles. The engine is made from a pure pc only engine so why the hell should they port a game that could’ve been done for the pc all the time? I am curious about the release and I decided to buy the game after I have pirated it. Those 3 brothers are turkish guys living in germany just like me so I have to show them some respect.</p>

<p>ok, i forgot something to get my point:<br>
the thing is that the PC-demo is only a XBOX-port and has nothing to do with the final Crysis 2 which was especially developed for the PC and are people forgetting this or just didn’t know but are crying arrount, how bad Crysis 2 on the PC looks. thx PC-version of Crysis 2 is supposed to use dx 11-features and that version (again) has nothing to do with the demo. that’s the point.</p>
<p>if that isn’t true and we don’t see the big difference between PC- and console-ports, then just Crytek was lying at the whole engine-development all the time.</p>

</aside>
<p>With all due respect, what you just said makes absolutely no sense. Who knows whether or not Crysis 2 is just a port from XBOX, thats irrelevant because there is absolutely no reason for the demo to be a port while the final game isn’t, or vice versa. If the demo is a port then the final version is a port, if the demo is coded specifically for PC then so is the final version; its one or the other.</p>

<p>Sorry, mechunit, but I don’t think you thought your post through, because in fact YOUR post is “fucking irrelevant”. You made 2 points: one that this is just a demo rather than the finished product, and also that it is only in DX9 right now.</p>
<p>This demo came out less than a month before release. They aren’t going to be making many graphical improvements (for DX9 mode I mean), so this is probably what the final game will look like in DX9.<br>
As to your second point, its also BS. Crysis 1 in DX9 High, while not exactly easily comparable to this demo because of the different environments, <span class="bbcode-i">still</span> looks a hell of a lot better IMHO.</p>

<p>Seeing as how “well” Crysis 1 did outside of a select few who could run it on launch, I’d say they actually know jack shit.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m 100% sure the final C2 will LOOK much better than what we’ve seen, and some few select glitches may be gone (some actions don’t show up in kill cams resulting in 3X more frustrating deaths, epileptic ragdolls, other minor shit)… But that’s it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Been playing the demo, the game itself has nice lighting and looks pretty, especially with the lens flares. It severely lacks detail though, the textures on hardcore are pretty bad, it seems they only have normal maps.</p>
<p>The motion blur is horrid though. As annoying as the first one’s motion blur could be at times, at least it was disabled in MP, and you could adjust the amount. 2 Seems to combat the annoyance by forcing yet more motion blur down are throats, they throw it around like it’s the highlight of the graphics almost - i guess they figured they could make up for the lack of visual detail in the demo by blurring everything. No console, so i can’t disable it, and gamer has a style of motion blur that looks even <span class="bbcode-i">worse</span>, so lowering settings isn’t an option.</p>
<p>On to the gameplay - It is fast paced and fairly fun, but It feels too much like a cod clone to me. The nanosuit’s 3 modes (1 passive and 2 active) are fairly easy to switch between, but they gave us the suit menu in this demo and it’s pointless to use now. Binoculars are pointless in MP, and it’s easier to switch with shortcuts, rather than open the menu.<br>
Which is odd because the menu was so much more fluid in the first.</p>
<p>Power is a joke mode though, because it does nothing but let you sprint like a normal soldier (not realistically, I mean compared to other games) and there is no way to power up your bashes. It’s almost like they threw in power mode for per…ahem, modules, and the other little things like jump height and sprint. Maybe i would feel differently if you could charge a punch up.</p>
<p>Armor and cloak are nicely implemented though, I like the stronger feel armor has, and Stealth killing isn’t spam happy like other games, and the cloak has a nice balance of visibility and range, so you can’t just walk right in front of your enemies.</p>
<p>Air stomping enemies is really fun, but I have a feeling it will get old pretty soon. Though it can be quite useful since you can kill people with a stomp from a normal power jump now.</p>
<p>The small maps are too big for a 12 player limit, half the time i find myself running around looking for people in a TIA match, should be 16.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s not bad, but it feels like the bastard child of Crysis and CoD, and the whole design of things seems very generic to me. Probably will get it when it comes out just because I am bored of the other games that I have. Assuming the editor comes on launch day.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I don’t think this rumor that’s floating around is true, but if it is its pretty fucking stupid:<br>
<a href="https://crymod.com/thread.php?threadid=67270&amp;sid=483bd0f18da644c51563dd7ca8bcb6a1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Crysis 2 may not support DX11 at launch</a></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>it seems you’ve got plenty of time for a senseless post like this.</p>
<p>the ONLY FACT is: the game isn’t out already and the demo only runs in directx 9! everybody cries around like a small child “crysis 2 doesn’t look as good as crysis 1 or game or engine XXX does”. i’m always wondering why people always i.e. start to complain an unfinished version with a patched and modded crysis 1 and say before crysis 2 is out “but crysis 1 looks better!” and don’t wait for the FINISHED game to come out with full dx 11 features and compare THAN with crysis 1 or other games!</p>
<p>with the gameplay i agree with you, the rest of your post is fucking irrelevant.</p>

            <p>Well, they didn’t fix my problem in that patch.<br>
I can only play 1 round, then when I enter a 2nd round (doesn’t matter if it’s the same server or a different one) it will always crash.</p>
