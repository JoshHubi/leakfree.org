    <description>Hi all,

Loooooong time reader, first time poster! I&#39;ve followed Black Mesa since the beginning, when it was announced I had a pretty nifty rig but since have moved house, had a family, and sold my rig for a more &quot;work friendley&quot; laptop which cant play Black Mesa :fffuuu:

Anyhu, Ive just draged out an even older rig specs are:

Athlon 64 3200+
3GB Memmory
GeForce 7800GS

This rig was the dogs gonads when i first built it! specifically for Half Life 2 as I remember but now its out dated and the 7800GS has died on me.

Ive replaced the 7800GS with a  RADEON HD 3850 (Yes its AGP, I bet some of you kids on here are thingink what the hell is AGP?!)

Can anyone hazzard a guess at a performance rate in fps for Black Mesa on this rig?

Thanks

Rob</description>

<p>Your computer will do just fine, Rob. Probably will have to turn down the graphics a good bit. Can’t really guess the framerate though.</p>

As I said, Lost Coast comes with HL2 (I think) and it’s a good way to measure performance.</p>

            <p>Wrong section, I think. Also I doubt people in here are oracles, call your hardware manufacturer if they are still functioning and ask. The closest I can help you is to tell you to run Lost Coast as Source tech demo on x settings and it should be about equal to BM</p>
