            <p>Music is typically mixed so that each instrument has it’s own “space” in the sonic spectrum. This is accomplished with panning (Left/right speaker combo) and equalization (frequency). Drums, bass, strings, piano, should each have their own frequency range which doesn’t really overlap with any other instrument. And for the most part they should be coming from their own “location” in the stereo field, from left to right. Although drums and bass are typically panned close together in the “center” range.</p>
<p>As far as the actual music… I’m not that musically educated as far as songwriting, but what I’d say is that the first 30 seconds have a progression of string chords, which have nothing to do with the rest of your song. However this is the most “musical” part of the composition. You should use each new instrument you bring in after 00:30 to repeat notes in the same series, to tie the song together. Not the same pattern of notes, but the same progression .I’m not sure how to explain it.</p>
<p>Drums - there’s too many different drum tracks IMO, it sounds sloppy. The thing you do with the drum track at 1:38 should happen in more than one part of the song, its the best thing you have going on.</p>

            <p>That was ok for a first. FL Studio, correct?<br>
I’m not sure what genre that would go in. lol.<br>
From 1:37 to the end was my favorite part. That part was actually pretty cool.<br>
Much like a lot of my first songs it seems more like a mish mash of ideas, which is what they will be for a while.<br>
I see potential though. Keep it up! Just keep making tunes and and you will get better.<br>
I’ve been making music for about 3 years now. I don’t use FL Studio, but I played around with it a few times. It has some great plugins.</p>
