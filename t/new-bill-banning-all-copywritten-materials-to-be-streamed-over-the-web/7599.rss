    <title>New bill banning all copywritten materials to be streamed over the web?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-bill-banning-all-copywritten-materials-to-be-streamed-over-the-web/7599</link>
    <description>Apparently a new bill is being passed to BAN the streaming of copywritten materials eg. video games, music, tv shows to prevent in the government&#39;s words, &quot;protection from child pornogrophy&quot;. This is a bill that concerns me deeply since most of the games I find out about are from youtube, blogs etc. So if this bill is passed, it may shut down huge companies like machinima and other LP&#39;rs on youtube. You can sign a petition here: [url]https://blog.demandprogress.org/mission/[/url] If anyone lives outside the US I think they may be alright but you can never be too sure. If you want, respond telling me what you think of this bill... Thanks.</description>

            <p>Theres already several threads on this…</p>
<p>I doubt it would even get close to passing. Even if it did, most game companies would likely either ignore it or include some kind of statement that allows people to do that, as they get a crapload more business from the free advertising of sorts in YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Bottom line, don’t worry. Nothing will change.</p>

            <p>If the companies are THAT worried of their content being distributed on youtube, they should file a lawsuit or something THEMSELVES, as WMG did - they removed the content effectively and banned it. It’s not the stupid government that decides who wants what. I have never heard of say Infinity Ward complain of millions of gamers showing their games (I’m suggesting IW, since CoD is probably the best (I’d rather worst) selling game at the time).</p>
<p>Besides, doesn’t this law make you a violator if you upload something original? I mean you DO have some copyright even if you don’t register it. Unless you upload under the agreement of having your video stolen and re-uploaded by some sucker who says it’s his and you being able to do nothing about it. There’s NOTHING wrong with that, is there? What the hell were those idiots thinking? I’d love to break in their offices and smash their heads with a crowbar :freeman:</p>
<p>And yeah, I’m pretty sure “child pornography” is not the reason for this bullshit.</p>

            <p>I’m a copyright holder, I say who can see my material with disclaimers and that sort of shit. If a copyright holder wants society to distribute footage of their material they usually understand that it’s going to happen without any effort on their part.</p>
<p>It’s been working this way for decades and making it illegal is the dumbest fucking thing in the universe.</p>

<p>This ^</p>
<p>Banning copyrighted material on say youtube and all the sites which can actually manage their content won’t stop pirates and probably won’t close all torrent sites.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, I see what happened. They watched a Bieber video and thought it was some sort of child abuse. I have nothing against them banning his videos :awesome:</p>
