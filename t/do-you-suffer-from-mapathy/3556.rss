<p>I really cant give any sort of logical reply to that, but ill try. Its a game, there are points, there are perks, there are game menus, its not real life. In real life you don’t get perks to help you dominate, you don’t get a second chance when you get shot. If the purpose of the game was realism, then they shouldn’t of added perks, and it should of been a squad based (skill level) game. The moment they threw realism off the table they should of done their absolute best to balance low and high levels so every game felt fair. But…this was not the case. Instead you get some fat kid from Texas sitting behind a bush the entire game shooting everyone that walks by and eventually gets a nuke strike. Maybe some of the fault is in players, but when 1/4 of every games ends in a nuke strike then something has to be done. The game is broken beyond repair, but by all means play it.</p>
