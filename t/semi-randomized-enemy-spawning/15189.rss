    <title>Semi-randomized enemy spawning?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/semi-randomized-enemy-spawning/15189</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to fill out my level with some more randomized elements, such as a way to spawn soldiers on the level randomly in certain places at runtime. I tried setting up a logic case/ npc_template_maker setup where npcs were supposed to spawn close to the player but out of their line of sight. However, the game didn&#39;t seem to respect player LOS and spawned with no regard for the player. Has anyone tried something like this and know how to do it? I found video tutorials on how to make a random spawn timer, but not spawning in a group of random spawnpoints.

If need be I can always just put a soldier in the location and have a patrol output on spawn so the soldier is in a different place each time, but I&#39;d like to have a bit more randomization than that if I can.</description>

            <p>The effect at current is using the Combine Binoculars filter from the coast chapters. I think it could look more accurate if I decided to relight the entire map with green colors, but I kinda liked the blue tint in terms of a stylistic choice. Blue NVGs may not be realistic but it might make sense for Combine because of their soldiers’ augs or something.</p>

            <p>I don’t believe you have the right coloration for night vision.<br>
This is an image from the GPNVG-18 which was the one used when Osama bin Laden’s compound was attacked. (It’s only $35,000).  It gives a 97 degree FOV rather than the standard 40 degree FOV.<br>
As you can see, there’s MUCH more green and brilliant whites in actual images than you’re displaying in yours.<br>

<p>So more likely than not I wouldn’t have gotten those specific benefits without having to port default assets into BM. IIRC the entdata on 2007 was 120% before you start getting crashes.<br>
The screen effect on these screenshots is supposed to be Combine night vision goggles affecting the player’s view. I may cut this effect later if people hate it.</p>

            <p>Thanks to engine improvements by the devs, maps can now theoretically go up to about 400% entdata- they just never adjusted the scale of the counter.</p>

            <p>I might need to make a fork of the map, I’m at 114% entdata in the current build. A new version that takes out all existing NPC spawns and puts on a full randomizer.</p>

            <p>That sounds like a related problem with the logic_case structure. I’d suggest removing some variables and starting with just one spawner that spawns at set intervals and one trigger_look enabling and disabling it. Then once that’s working, you can move up to multiple random spawners.</p>

            <p>The other big thing is that logic case was not picking randomly, it was just spawning both random spawners. Maybe my entity setup was too complex.</p>

            <p>My best suggestion would be to use trigger_looks set to disable the spawn points when a player looks at them and disable them when the player looks away again.</p>
