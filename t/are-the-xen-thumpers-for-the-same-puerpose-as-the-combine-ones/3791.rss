            <p>A few days ago, I have found one aspect to be sure that the thumpers from Xen hasn´t the same function of the combine thumpers. I don´t know why but an extrange program error makes that sometimes you can´t see an extrange green circular ray moveing up above this Xen thumpers, specially if you don´t run during the chapter. (Truly, this happens on my computer at less) Personaly I think that this rays makes this thumpers somthing diferent than the combine thumpers… So, actually I don´t think that this thumpers are  for the same puerpose as the Combine ones.</p>

            <p>also Oppossing Force is the only Official expansion wich has the Race-X, of course they only appeared in some sectors of black mesa and mostly after Freeman got into Xen. But for now those ‘‘xen thumpers’’ could count as what I said until valve reveals WTF was the Race-X doing there or if those things are thumpers or not.</p>

            <p>It’s not that it’s non-canon, it’s just that Valve has departed from that storyline so they don’t factor it into their newer plots, with HL2 and beyond.</p>
<p>That said, Opposing Force does nothing to contradict the overall HL story, so it’s canon unless Valve says otherwise</p>

<p>srisly in theory this is what (I think) was going to happen with the race-x in oppossing force: they were going to attack and fight against the Xenians while ya fighted against them and black ops but then a guy from valve/gearbox thinked: Why we don’t make them cooperate against the humans? And then the Slave, zombie, headcrab, ichtyosaur and houndeye AI wasn’t updated/changed but the others still being enemies of the Race-X cause of that (also the gargantua will attack the voltigore and the shock trooper but no the pit drone or the shock roach)</p>

<p>I don´t think which the race-X could be enemys of the Xenians, because you can see the vortigaunts fighting close to the shock troopers like a team in Oppossing force. Therefore, I think again that all they are slaves of the combine. In addition you can see the race-X very close to the shock troopers like dogs of them. So, I think that all this can prove that all the new enemys of shephard are not enemys of the Xenians. Then, in any case, if that thumpers are there to maintain far away the shock roaches could be possible although this is not possible for the race-X case, because I have said you that this species are like pets of the shock troopers, so, they aren´t dangerous to the Xenians from my perspective.</p>
<p>PD: The race-X is dangerous for the shock roaches onlyXD<br>
PDII: Sorry for possible mistakes but all this is true, you can check it playing Half-life: Oppossing force. So, by using only this game it is not possible to say which those enemys are enemys of the Xenians because they dosen´t fight between them never in that game.<br>
PDIII: But if you dont belive me I have pics from the game to prove my testimony XD see yaa</p>

<p>sure you will.</p>
<p>Now returning to threat: I have a little question: couldn’t be those thumpers some kind of security to stop the race-X (seen in oppossing force) to attack Xen? I mean as how you can see they teleport though Xen portals to earth and they are enemies of the Xenians. That could be some kind of security sistem against them or against the shock roaches (wich are like ants) of the shock troopers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don´t think that the race-X could be enemys of the Xenians, because you can see the vortigaunts fighting close to the shock troopers like a team in Oppossing force. Therefore, I think again that all they are slaves of the combine. In addition you can see the race-X very close to the shock troopers like dogs of them. So, I think that all this can prove that all the new enemys of shephard are not enemys of the Xenians. Then, in any case, if that thumpers are there to maintain far away the shock roaches could be possible although this is not possible for the race-X case, because I have said you that this species are like pets of the shock troopers, so, they aren´t dangerous to the Xenians from my perspective.</p>
<p>PD : The race-X is dangerous for the shock roaches only and the Shock troopers are dangerous for the gargantuas XD<br>
PDII: Sorry for possible mistakes but all this is true, you can check it playing Half-life: Oppossing force. So, by using only this game it is not possible to say which those enemys are enemys of the Xenians because they dosen´t fight between them never in that game.<br>
PDIII: But if you dont belive me I have pics from the game to prove my testimony XD see yaa</p>

<p>Opposing Force isn’t canon, so no. Race-X is the creation of a different developer and therefore isn’t considered to be part of the official Half-Life world.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>REMEMBER that the only reason they went to XEN is to escape the Combine Empire! So probably the Vorts left their flock in their home world. It was 1995 when Nihilanth’s race retreated to XEN. About 5 years before the resonance cascade so 5 years is not enough to establish much technology or to farm antlions. So there were no antlions in XEN.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m sure that’s completely fake. Also I think the antlions are originally from Xen, the Nihilianth’s death portals only opened up in:<br>
-Xen.<br>
-A planet under combine control.<br>
-Earth.</p>
