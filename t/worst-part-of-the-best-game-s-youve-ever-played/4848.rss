            <p>The final boss of MegaMan X3, I died hundreds of times and had a sore thumb by the time I beat him, I got really lucky though. Oh, and the final boss of Megaman X4, I haven’t beaten the bastard until today… If you think I’m lying just look them up on YouTube!</p>

<p>Seriously? Fighting through dark caves, legions of elite pirates and research rooms and security centers was amazing, with the Omega Pirate being the cherry on top. Granted the first time I played through that game I was scared shitless because I was young and it was a pain in the ass because I only had eight energy tanks when I first played it. But try playing the Spider Guardian in Echoes with four, because when you’re that young you suck at item collecting and exploration.</p>

            <p>How is it overwhelming? You go towards the striders, you throw a bomb at them, and then shoot it. Towards the end you begin to not be able to get to them, and then you just wait near the dispenser and easily throw magnussuns at them. It really isn’t hard at all.</p>
<p>As a side note, few times when you have to rush like crazy to meet objectives are monotonous. This was no exception.</p>

            <p>No, that part sucked.</p>
<p>Also, God of War 1, that bit where you have to climb the revolving knife things out of hades. SO IRRITATING.</p>

<p>Also, what are straiders?</p>

            <p>or just go into the middle room and put the turrets so they look both sides and you can pick them up without going out of it ? Beat it on hard with losing almost no hp a week ago. I actually didnt consider it a bit hard until i noticed so many ppl have problems with it here ;D</p>
<p>And for the worst level ever it would have to be the ending straiders fight in  half life 2 ep 2.<br>
Everything about it sucks.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are supposed to navigate a level you see for first time with no minimap, you will get lost all the time unless you play it for few times.</li>
<li>Way too much backtracking, the car should hold more than 1 bomb, its easier to save and load than to go for another one.</li>
<li>You cant fucking see where you throw them, why do they cover half the screen and arent semi transparent or just under the crosshair ?</li>
<li>There is no build up with less stariders so you can get to know the level, and figure out a tactic, they just all go at once form start.</li>
<li>Most weapons are useless since there are only hunters coming, why the hell is there even ammo for them…</li>
<li>Rest of the guys gets wiped by 1 hunter, why are they even there ?</li>
</ol>

<p>Post the parts of your favourite video games that you hated the most.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Half Life 2</span> - The part where you’re with Alyx in Nova Prospekt and you have to set up the turrets and fight off waves of enemies.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you’re talking about the part in the H-shaped corridor where they come in from 4 entrances, that part is easy.</p>
<p>Stack up boxes to create stairs back up to the elevated platform at one end of the H. Set up a line of turrets there and the Combine will all come through a narrow choke point and get mowed down.</p>
<p>When it’s over though Alyx will walk right past you and yell over the railing down to where you’re “supposed” to be. Jump back down and the scripting will work normally.</p>
<p>It’s not really cheating, just using your head!</p>

            <p>I always sprinted like a motherfucker too, those bastards always have perfect aim, though, because as I was sprinting to the entrance, I was shot dead AT LEAST 5 times.</p>

<p>R…really??! You mean all this time, I felt like a cowardly aim-lacking douche, while in fact running was an acceptable solution?! This completely changes my outlook on life. To think, all this time I was being humble… and for naught…</p>

Half Life 2 - sandtraps (finished it without touching the sand) it pisses me of when i have to pick up all those doors and SH** to get through the level.</p>
<ul>

<p>amazing, you mean outside of the empty environments there is even more barren gameplay-less territory to explore? Fantastic!<br>
And how could I forget those “trees and lizards,” truly I was wrong to ever doubt SOTC’s flourishing wild ecosystem. Really makes the world feel “alive.”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>lol. Once again you miss the point. The world is supposed to feel dead, with Dormin’s presence. At the end of the game, the main characters retreat to an area that does flourish with life. there’s a bunch of deer, rabbits, turtles, a squirrel, doves, and owls. Obviously they could have used those assets in the rest of the forbidden land, but they didn’t, because it goes against the feeling that the forbidden land was once alive and thriving (evidenced by the various manmade structures), but is now almost completely dead.</p>
