    <title>What happened to the &#39;Apprehension&#39; chapter title?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-happened-to-the-apprehension-chapter-title/15109</link>
    <description>Wondering if anyone else has noticed that the chapter title &#39;Apprehension&#39; which is supposed to display when the player enters  map bm_c2a3a seems to be absent now.  I seem to recall it always popped up while the player was in transit on the runaway freight tram at the very start of the level.  I&#39;m sure this was in the 2012 version, but cannot recall if it was ever present in the 2015 release, or if it somehow got lost in a recent update... or am I just crazy and did the title get moved to a different part of the game and I&#39;m simply not noticing it?

Apologies if this has been reported already.</description>

            <p>Can confirm. I just got to this part of the game last night, and I thought perhaps the title had been moved. But I didn’t see another title until Residue Processing.</p>

            <p>Yep, it’s missing. Finished the chapter the last weekend and the title does not appear anywhere.</p>

            <p>I’ve been questioning this as well. The Lambda Core title is fixed in the Steam release, but Apprehension title no longer displays.</p>
