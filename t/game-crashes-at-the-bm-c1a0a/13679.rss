    <title>Game crashes at the bm_c1a0a</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-at-the-bm-c1a0a/13679</link>
    <description>Hi,
I&#39;ve just reinstalled Black Mesa to replay but the game crashes just after I wore the suit and take the lift to go down. The game try to load the new map but crashes. HL2 works fine, the last time I played BlackMesa (maybe a year ago...) it worked fine.
map; bm_c1a0a, getpos setpos -1343.984863 1635.995361 352.031250;setang 17.413330 73.536987 0.000000. I&#39;m taking the lift to go down. At the bottom the game try to load the new map but crashes.

My pc have a I7 2.8, 6GB RAM, AMD RAdeon 5800 1GB and I use win7 64 SP1 in Italian but hope you can understand..
This is the error I get on Event viewer:
