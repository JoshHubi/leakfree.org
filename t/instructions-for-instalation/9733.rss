    <title>INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALATION?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/instructions-for-instalation/9733</link>
    <description>Helo everyone!

I&#39;m kind of noob with Steam mods and SDK, can somebody explain the instalation proces, and how to run the game?

I dont have a source game I download the SDK 2007. I download the torrent file and Installed it, after it finished i just say to run it. But now that i closed the game I don&#39;t know what to do.

Any help please? I&#39;m really enjoying this mod!!!:retard:</description>

            <p>We also posted about needing the SDK on facebook. And twitter. And the Steam Group.</p>
<p>We tried!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Black Mesa did not show up in my list of games until I restarted Steam.</p>

            <p>Before the release there was a stickied thread where a developer  (was it Hubi?) described the prerequisites for the mod (SDK, disk space). Was it deleted in the transition?</p>
<p>Now this info is in the wiki: <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/System_Requirements" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/System_Requirements</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit</span>: nevermind, the post is there. it’s the stickied one in the <span class="bbcode-b">news</span> section <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12295" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Launch Details</a></p>

<p>Yosharian, what it needs is the Source SDK Base (2007). It’s essentially the latest version of the source engine as a “game” without any content in it. You can’t play Black Mesa without that installed, and we did try to explain this to people beforehand.</p>
<p>Go to your library, click in the upper left and select Tools, then look in that list.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know that now.  What I’m trying to figure out is the most efficient way to get hold of this.  Installing HL2:E2/TF2 didn’t automatically install the SDK.</p>
<p>Installing HL2:E2 appears to have speeded up the download somewhat.  Just waiting on 200MB or so now.  (or maybe it was TF2 that speeded it up, god knows)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“and we did try to explain this to people beforehand.”</span></p>
<p>It doesn’t specify that SDK is needed when you click on the ‘download’ button on the main page.  Even a little note at the bottom of that dialog saying BTW U NEED SOURCE SDK DOWNLOAD THAT FROM STEAM would have been fine.  I can’t find anywhere on the main page any reference to SDK at all.</p>
<p>By the way, not meaning to sound negative, I’m bloody stoked to play this, that’s all.</p>

            <p>I too, am confused with this.  I downloaded and installed the Black Mesa mod, went to Steam to load it, and…  up pops a dialog asking me to download the Source SDK?  Great, another 4GB download.</p>
<p>So I do a little googling but nobody appears to know how to get this thing without downloading it, off to Orange Box I go.  Installed TF2… no SDK.  Installing H2:E2… about to find out whether SDK is included in that…</p>
<p>I’m sure everyone that reads this is going to respond with H4R H4R N00B DIDN’T EVEN KNOW SOURCE SDK WAS REQUIRED but really, it didn’t specify this on the website.  I could have downloaded this in advance if I had known.</p>
