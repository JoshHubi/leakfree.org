<p>Agreed, this is a big deal. Of course you can just use a redirect but that dosnt guarantee that everyone has the same version of the map. Workshop is really useful for authors that frequently update maps.</p>
<p>I think the community would benefit greatly from workshop server integration.</p>

<p>We totally agree with you! This is something we are looking into and have planned in our road map. I will let everyone know when we have more details to share.</p>
