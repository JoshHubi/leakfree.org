    <title>F*ck... I think my Steam account was hacked...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/f-ck-i-think-my-steam-account-was-hacked/4804</link>
    <description>Okay, this has got me buggin&#39; out. Out of nowhere a friend randomly started talking to me about whether I had experience with modelling for source. I didn&#39;t think much of it because he had been in the Source SDK alot recently. So I said no but i was learning. He said &quot;OK&quot; then we stopped chatting. About 5 minutes later he asked me If I had Counter Strike source. I said yeah because I figured he just wanted to play. Then he started talking about all the games I have, and noticed Codename: Gordon on the list, then he asked me If I&#39;m the type of person that mainly sticks with free stuff... That&#39;s when it hit me, so I responded Yes, I really only get the free stuff. Then he said Okay, and I lost connection to steam... This seems like a hack, and it&#39;s buggin&#39; me because I hardly have any money, and now that I got a computer capable of playing these games, I might have just been hacked. If this IS a hack, what are my options and what are the chances of getting my account back?

EDIT: Okay, I&#39;ve regained connection (No i didn&#39;t log out) out of nowhere.</description>

            <p>Okay, I did a scan with McAfee and Avast(which took 'till 4 in the morning) and I was 100% virus free (or that’s what they told me anyway). By “friend” I mean a real life friend who I speak to in person at least 3 times a week. I just found it weird to randomly ask me if I have a game that a. He knows I have, b. I’ve played it with him at least twice and c. you can just read it off my profile.</p>
<p>Everything’s (seemingly) back to normal, although at times he’s online when he usually wasn’t before. I think at the time I was just thinking too much of it because alot of the recent hacks.</p>
<p>As for the fake sites, I have it the real <a href="http://SteamPowered.com" rel="nofollow noopener">SteamPowered.com</a> site bookmarked so I never click any links or anything because I’m not a trustful person.</p>

            <p>What do you mean by “friend”?<br>
Try logging back into Steam, then change your password just to be safe (and do those scans).</p>
<p>Also, don’t say you haven’t been to any fake Steam sites, since you really wouldn’t know they were fake.</p>

<p>What he said.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like this person is just trying to freak you out by reading out your games list: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crypt19/games?tab=all" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crypt19/games?tab=all</a></p>
<p>No hacks there, it’s in your profile.  And then you randomly lost your connection to Steam , which happens sometimes.  I shouldn’t worry if I were you.</p>

            <p>That seems only a normal steam community update, it makes the whole community (or a part of it) te be disconnected while they do updaets to the community system… it happens really often.</p>
