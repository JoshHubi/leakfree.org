    <title>What do you think is needed to make Half-Life even better?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-do-you-think-is-needed-to-make-half-life-even-better/8390</link>
    <description>Half-Life series has to be one of the best game series ever. But, as everyting else, it may be not perfect. What do you think, what does it need to become better?
In my oppinion, the thing that can be improved is music. If Valve add more instrumental music( don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Half-Life music a lot) , like in Crysis 2, it would be a lot better, if you ask me. But everyone is free to dissagree and state their oppinion.</description>

            <p>You know, improving A.I. would be great. For example, when shooting them, instead of ducking , soldiers should jump or even roll out of the way.<br>
Also, improving Combine Elite behavior, for example doing evades frecuently or dodging slow projectiles. Seriously, in HL2 they are only little more durable and capable of shooting energy ball , compared to normal ones , but repeat the same behaviour. They are more of a “heavy” versions than “elite”.</p>

<p>Doom 3 was all dark all the time. That’s why it didn’t really work as well as id wanted. You need to accentuate dark areas by contrasting them with well lit areas. The martian base in Doom 3 was a textbook example of infringing health regulations by having all areas very badly lit, even in the areas before the demonic invasion happened.

<p>Especially because you had to choose whether to be able to see or be able to shoot. I still find it funny as well because I just finished Splinter Cell and am playing Chaos Theory and it seems really strange at how dark everything is. It makes me wonder how the guards are supposed to guard anything when they can’t see you sneak past 3 feet in front of them  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  .</p>

            <p>I hope Half-Life 3 has the same time of levels and style of exploration+puzzles as the original. Half-life 1 had better levels than the second game by far.</p>
<p>Any changes to the game for Black Mesa hopefully will stay true to the style of the original. The game needs nothing else in my opinion. It is the closest to perfection out of all of the games I’ve ever played.</p>

            <p>Better AI (or at least enemies that move more) and more enemy variety. I mean it was good in HL1 for it’s time on those departments, but HL2 was kinda lackluster in that field. Even for 2004.</p>

<p>I did but maybe the impression of “normal” never left me I dunno. Also rebels got slaughtered not because they were weak because the AI was dumb. They always loved to walk right into indestructable dropship gun’s fire or strider’s penis explosion. Still combine soldiers seem a little weak to me when we are slaughtering them like mad. Breen was lying to the Combine.<br>
Humans as synths suck ass.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not really. The resistance NPC have very little health and can be taken down with relatively few hits. I think if you take Freeman out of the picture the resistance don’t hold up against the Combine soldiers, let alone against their synth support too. At least I thought that was what the game was trying to portray.</p>
<p>Combine soldiers are rewired humans with a bit of body armour, nothing more. Cheap and cheerfull ( by command ) with very few resources needed to be spent on their upkeep and equipment. Why bother sending in your precious syths when you can send in tons of cannon fodder to sponge up some bullets and generally swarm an area. Cannon fodder I’l add that is in vast supply, and readily available. Just black bag some more citizens.</p>
<p>Why would the Combine give a shit about how many they lose? They have enough replacements.</p>

<p>How were the rebels doing well? They are getting slaughtered left right and center, even when Gordon is fighting with them.</p>
<p>Play on hard, that might change your mind as to how tough the Combine actually should be. See how many civis you manage to get through alive on hard, have them next to you at all times.</p>

<p>I did but maybe the impression of “normal” never left me I dunno. Also rebels got slaughtered not because they were weak because the AI was dumb. They always loved to walk right into indestructable dropship gun’s fire or strider’s penis explosion. Still combine soldiers seem a little weak to me when we are slaughtering them like mad. Breen was lying to the Combine.<br>
Humans as synths suck ass.</p>

<p>True, but it was done so badly. I love Half Life 2, but the A.I. seems so dead to me – maybe I have just played it too much.</p>
<p>The game doesn’t let you take all of the world’s destruction in - it jumps into action too fast. That’s why I mentioned the beta. In the beta, there is a whole sequence in which you are find your way through the city streets and see a lot of grim and freaky shit.</p>
<p>I.e. Giant moving pipelines digging in the earth; Children working on Creamator helmets; giant furnaces and the sounds of metal clashing all with dark purple skies filled with ash and flame from industry; citizen walking in lines while being guarded by city scanners and Metrocops with trenchcoats; Striders and gunships moaning while on patrol. Real ambient shit…</p>

            <p>More Realism, but not in the shitty way!</p>
<p>I mean like come on. How do fuck does a rebel in some clothing can beat asses of many Alien bio-engineered awesome suit wearing badasses? I can understand that with main characters but It destroys the whole desperate humanity concept since the rebels are god.</p>
<p>That’s what I would like to see in HL2, a more post apocalyptic atmosphere.<br>
It would have made Gordon’s journey more epic since we would be saving a doomed human race. What I saw in HL2 was The rebels were doing just fine without us. We just came to finish it. Humanity never seemed so desperate to me. Damn you leakers, why!? why!?</p>

            <p>How about a more lively City 17 pre-uprising?</p>
<p>Seems pretty lax for the flag-city in a world that has been taken over by aliens. Why not have the skies dark with burning ashes (Like Stalingrad, 1942) and have Air-watch gunships flying overhead constantly. Maybe more concentration camps and raids; more Striders and spotlights. What about some random Civil Protection shake downs and some visuals of citizen getting beaten to death by Metro Cops? Maybe some air-raid sirens and marching Combine soldiers like the Nuremberg rally?</p>
<p>Oh wait, they did a lot of that in the beta and removed it – damn…</p>

<p>Solid observation sir! Although, the two primaries (Glock 9mm, H&amp;K Mp7 @ 4.6mm) you’re likely referring to deliver almost no kinetic energy to the target, instead relying on hydrostatic shock and a volume of rounds to short out the body’s various nerve and fluid-circulation systems. Basic body armor (CP’s) will stop pistol rounds pretty easily, leaving the enemy able to piss you off for an extra three seconds as you better place your rounds.  The 4.6mm will poke dainty little holes in stuff all day long, but you have to peg the armored thugs in the head for best effect…sort like real life.</p>
