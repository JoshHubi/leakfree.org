    <title>problems with new monitor</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problems-with-new-monitor/1807</link>
    <description>A lot of my games stopped working because I got a new monitor with a much larger resolution than my old one. A lot of the games won&#39;t but up, and Crysis, one of the ones that will boot up, doesn&#39;t have 1920x1080 resolution and won&#39;t work on anything else, windowed or not.

<p>Done this before, but will do again. Last time it fucked up my computer and took me hours to make things work, lets hope it actually works this time.</p>
<p>EDIT: decided to test NFS Shift and realized it was set to my old monitor’s resolution so I set it to mine and now it keeps starting up in a window even though I set it to fullscreen and it crashes like the other games right after showing me a few logos.</p>
<p>I will update my Nvidia drivers, but not now, maybe this weekend, I don’t feel like dealing with a fried computer atm.</p>

</aside>
<p>They usually get through one or two logos then give me an engine error and crash. Yes, Crysis Warhead doesn’t have my screen’s resolution on the list.</p>
<p>All try all the things listed here and come back when I’m done.</p>
<p>EDIT: tried the site and it didn’t have instructions for Crysis Warhead or Rainbow Six Vegas 2 (the two broken games I am most interested in fixing). Also, I found a monitor driver disk that I had never noticed before and ran it, but it told me the driver required Vista. I looked online for the monitor’s driver (iH252) and couldn’t come up with anything.</p>
<p>Finally, I don’t know how to make an autoconfig and by scaling settings do you mean if it’s set to 1920x1080 in the Nvidia control panel? I just checked that and it is.</p>

            <p>The other thing to check is that you have the correct <span class="bbcode-u">monitor</span> drivers installed - you may need to take a swing past WindowsUpdate or similar.<br>
The GPU can’t be expected to get it right if the monitor is not able to tell it what it can do.</p>

<p>Go there, and it’ll tell you how to manually change most games to any resolution you want, and should fix them for you.</p>
<p>(do a wiki search for the title of your game)</p>

<p>New Graphics card?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve got a 9800gtx. It should be able to support my monitor right? Some games do work full res like the L4D2 demo and Deadspace.</p>
<p>Also I haven’t tried reinstalling the games yet because that will be a massive hassle and that is the next thing I’m gonna do, I was just going here in case there’s an easier way to do this.</p>
