    <title>What is the hymen really for?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-the-hymen-really-for/5130</link>
    <description>Apart from being a fairly unreliable status indicator of a woman&#39;s virginity (there are reports of mothers still having their hymen intact) what really is it for?

Is it useless like the appendix or does it serve a purpose?

Wikipedia doesn&#39;t even begin to explain its possible uses and I&#39;m far too lazy to look somewhere else.

Besides, you guys are funnier.</description>

            <p>yeah, well i’m sure you can understand if you’ve really worked with so many rape victims that it’s a fine line between what he’s doing and attempting to justify rape.</p>
<p>also apparently<br>
“The physiological purpose of the hymen is one of the eternal mysteries of women’s bodies. Although it doesn’t seem to have a specific function, it’s thought that hymen tissue remains as a vestige of vaginal development. Embryologically, it tended to keep germs and dirt out of the vagina.”</p>

<p>Who the fuck cares if someone on these boards got raped? It’s of no importance to my point that there is a chance that a vagina can lubricate despite the fact that the girl doesn’t want it to be.</p>
<p>Yes, there might be someone here that got raped, and yes that person may just come in here and say that it hurt and that her vagina didn’t lubricate, <span class="bbcode-i">so what</span>? Does that suddenly change the fact some other girl might have been raped and had a lubricating vagina despite her fear and unwillingness?</p>
<p>No idea why you’re filtering out certain parts of my reasoning just so you can have a chance to be a blabbering vagina, but I did -not- say that every rape victim was aroused or had a lubricating vagina and I did not say that rape never hurts. I did say that a girl may have a lubricating vagina in some cases and that it doesn’t always hurt if they did. But as long as you’re too thick to get that through your skull, I see no point in trying to defend my stance on this.</p>
<p>And you dare call me ignorant.</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh, ok. You don’t care about rape victims. All i needed to know, thanks. And again, we were talking about generally, not a one in a fucking billion case of a girl getting her life ruined and getting aroused during it.</p>

            <p>It doesn’t matter, Bolteh.  You still really should just shut your yap.</p>
<p>And seek a bit of therapy on your interpersonal issues.</p>

<p>No, Bolteh is quite right. I’ve read about girls who’ve been raped having massive guilt issues because they’ve orgasmed during the assault, and people who’ve not been uncomfortable physically. He didn’t say that they enjoyed it on an emotional or physical level. Learn to read.</p>
