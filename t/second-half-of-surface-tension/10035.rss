    <title>Second half of Surface Tension...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/second-half-of-surface-tension/10035</link>
    <description>...supposed to be at night? To be specific- I am talking about after you kill the apache and climb through the drain pipes in to the man-made canals. It looks like there is light coming from the sun but the skybox is completely dark. I can still play but it is just odd. Is this on purpose?

BTW: I love how you guys made Questionable Ethics. It is creepy as fuck now.</description>
