    <title>Suddenly sprinting everywhere?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suddenly-sprinting-everywhere/14570</link>
    <description>So I decided to come back to this game to try and get some of the achievements I missed or didn&#39;t quite meet the requirements for in my first run, and now that I&#39;ve gotten the HEV suit, I&#39;m constantly moving at spinting speed? Every time I push forward (&#39;w&#39; in my case) it plays the little jet noise it usually does when you sprint and I&#39;m going sprint speed. I tried saving and reloading the game entirely, but it&#39;s still happening.

Only workshop add-ons I&#39;ve got going are one that tweaks something in the suit&#39;s voice intro, which really shouldn&#39;t affect this, and a thing to make the blood spatter on viewmodels look better, so I&#39;ve no idea what&#39;s causing it. Any ideas? This is really distracting, and I&#39;d hate to have to put the game back down because of it.

After a little experimenting, I&#39;ve come to realize it&#39;s only the forward button that does it. Even when I switch to the arrow keys, it&#39;s the exact same thing. Was this how it was before? Am I going crazy?

EDIT: Decided to try reloading a save from an older run and the problem still persisted, so this clearly isn&#39;t specific to any one location. It [i]only[/i] started after I got the HEV suit.</description>

            <p>Well I’m dumb. Still, why on Earth did that suddenly get turned on? It certainly wasn’t on last time I played. Perhaps make it so that isn’t the default, or whatever caused it to just get flipped on without my knowledge.</p>

            <p>Well, have you enabled the “always sprinting” in the options ?</p>
