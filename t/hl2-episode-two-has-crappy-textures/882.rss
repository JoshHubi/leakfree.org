    <title>HL2 Episode Two has crappy textures...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-episode-two-has-crappy-textures/882</link>
    <description>Okay, I don&#39;t know what the hell happened, but I&#39;ve always played the HL games on max settings, and now all of the sudden Episode Two displays what can only be described as low res textures despite being set to display very high texture detail! I never had this problem before, in fact I&#39;m not sure how this could&#39;ve happened overnight since it all worked perfect yesterday.

I even did a complete uninstallation of all my STEAM games and mods, even STEAM itself and the STEAM folder in My Programs, and I deleted the Valve registry key and deleted my TEMP folder. Then I reinstalled STEAM, updated it, reinstalled HL2 Episode Two from the retail disc, updated it and it still has this problem!

I don&#39;t know if it affects HL2/Ep1 since I haven&#39;t got them installed for now, but since they share their assets with Episode Two I can only assume they do.

I always set my graphical settings to the max (screen size, texture detail, AA, AF, shaders,...) and I never had any problems whatsoever. But now it will only show the low quality textures! Look:

It looks terrible! Appart from the AR2, the other weapons don&#39;t seem to be affected, or at least I don&#39;t think since they look decent.

Can someone please help me with this?</description>

            <p>Well it’s never happened to me before, even in those rare cases when ATI CCC resets, and I have 2 GB ram so I doubt that would be the problem.</p>

            <p>ATI Catalyst Control still has a stupid AI as I would say,<br>
It depends on the Ram of your system, if it is being overpowered or anything like that, The ATI center panics and does what it can to fix it.</p>
<p>That’s probably what happened to you…</p>
<p>But if you have a good amount of Ram, then it just went hoopa loopa.</p>

            <p>Okay, I feel really stupid. Something changed the settings in the ATI Catalyst Control Center, it set Mipmaps to the lowest and set AA and AF to Override Application. I set them back to the highest settings and let the applications decide. Sorry for this :S</p>
<p>Not sure what changed these settings though, the only thing different between yesterday and today is that I installed some mods for HL2, but that shouldn’t change my driver settings, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your help.</p>
