    <title>Team History, anyone ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/team-history-anyone/14381</link>
    <description>[b]Hello[/b],
I&#39;m an amateur game developer/level designer since 2007, and while I&#39;ve been able to complete and release several games, all my attempts to set up a team to assist me during a full development cycle were quite vain.
So, I have several questions for you, Developers.


[b]H[/b]ow the idea of doing a complete remake of Half-Life originally came from ?
[b]H[/b]ow large was the team at the project launch ?
[b]A[/b]nd last but not least, how the new members joined the dev team ?


[b]Thank you for your time and see you soon.[/b]    :slight_smile:</description>
