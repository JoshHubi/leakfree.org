    <description>I has two new music tracks for yous.
 
[b]Influence Of Mind[/b]
  
Influence Of Mind takes a little trip into Psychedelic Rock territory. Basically, I&#39;ve taken some ideas from Pink Floyd and regurgitated them into my own thing. There are some other influences in there too, but whatever, you&#39;ll notice the Floyd.  :stuck_out_tongue:

[b]Astral Projection[/b]
 
Astral Projection is an upbeat and carefree sounding electronic track. 808 drums, crusty synth sounds and some strings. There&#39;s also a bit of guitar towards the end. I wrote this one during a justin.tv video broadcast.

            <p>I’ve been looking for a software 808 emulator for ages, tough to find for Mac for some reason.</p>
<p>I’ve heard Us and Them of course, I’m a big Psych Rock fan. Depending on the version you are listening to, they definitely have fairly epic fills involving lots of toms during transitions between verses. But I see where you are coming from with the overall low-key-ness of the drums, it does sound much like that song.</p>

            <p>Thanks!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The Hammond sound is Native Instruments B4. I started with the “Tune In Drop Out” preset and increased the cabinet rotation speed and a few other minor adjustments. It’s also going through Guitar Rig 3 for the delay and chorusing effects on it.</p>
<p>The drum track is intentionally simple and not full of flourishes and fills. Check out, “Us And Them” by Pink Floyd and you should hear what I was going for.</p>
<p>The 808 sounds are just samples that have been processed with distortion and EQ. And yeah, all the sounds are pretty thin. I was going for bright and Pop sounding. But still, perhaps too thin.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Influence - not bad! The Hammond sound is pretty right on, what are you using for it, did you make the patch yourself, etc - want to share anything about it?<br>
The drum fills are a little un-epic compared to the rest of it, could use some tom actions. In fact the whole drum track is a little more “smooth jazz” than “psych rock” in my opinion.</p>
<p>Astral - what are you using to simulate an 808? The fills are good, the portamento lead is a little repetative and “thin” for my tastes but you do chiptunes so that might be intentional. And on the other hand all the non-lead sounds (except for the filter sweeps, which are cool but also IMO thin) sound excellent.</p>
<p>I hope one day to be as ill as you are at computer music, your stuff is inspiring. I just need an interface so I can record my drum machine and I also need to buy a fuckin’ alpha Juno so bad, I wants it…</p>
