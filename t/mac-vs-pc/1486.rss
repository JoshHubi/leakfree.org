    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mac-vs-pc/1486</link>
    <description>I know that alot of people would say mac and alot pc, but you cant compare them, there both good, i have both so i should know, and the reason you cant compare them is because they both do completely different thing. Its like trying to compare a cheeseburger and a towel, it cant be done!!!

I rest my point</description>

<p>Really, if you’re waiting for an answer to this, you’ll be waiting a while.  As far as I know every major image/video/3d/other program is on Windows as well as Mac.  They just like to bring up that argument so they don’t feel as ripped off by their over-priced hardware.</p>

<p>Honestly, I get sick of seeing Mac’s TV commercials “LOL WINDOWS HAS BILLIONS OF VIRUSES, 3 SECONDS ON THE INTERWEBS GIVES YOU VIRUSES” That’s what they pretty much  say, Which is total bull shit. Mac are just as prone to get infected as Windows, the only reason why there are more bugs out there for windows is because Windows is more popular. I installed AVG and I haven’t been infected for years. No problems, nothing.</p>
<p>If you’re stupid enough to fall for the adds like “FREE AV PROGRAM HERE, CLICK HERE AND DOWNLOAD AVPROGRAM.EXE TO I FIX ALL OF YOUR VIRUSES” It doesn’t matter what OS you have, you’re going to get infected and you deserve it!</p>
<p>I’m all for giving Macs and Windows equal opportunities (I’d like to have one of their laptops, but for there price I can get a pure 1337 gaming laptop lol.) And I love DX10 with my 295 so, yeah…</p>

<p>Macs SUCK big time. They really do. The first game that I completed on the Macbook was Minerva: Metastasis. The game crashed after every hour of gameplay. That was the longest time that the game would run until crashing. It’s because DirectX does not get along with Mac hardware on a Bootcamped Windows OS. Macs are only good for OpenGL games and those games are all from the 90’s. I have a coworker of mine that has promised to build me a gaming PC. All I have to do is give him the list of parts I want and he goes to price sites to find the websites that have the cheapest parts. After all, I don’t want to play Black Mesa on this MacCrap and have it crash from 5 minutes in the game to an hour. I don’t want to click on the “Would you like to send an error report?” box that comes up with each crash. I want to play Black Mesa without any interruptions. Also I want to play it on Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate on a gaming PC instead of Windows XP on my Mac.</p>

            <p>Macs SUCK big time. They really do. The first game that I completed on the Macbook was Minerva: Metastasis. The game crashed after every hour of gameplay. That was the longest time that the game would run until crashing. It’s because DirectX does not get along with Mac hardware on a Bootcamped Windows OS. Macs are only good for OpenGL games and those games are all from the 90’s. I have a coworker of mine that has promised to build me a gaming PC. All I have to do is give him the list of parts I want and he goes to price sites to find the websites that have the cheapest parts. After all, I don’t want to play Black Mesa on this MacCrap and have it crash from 5 minutes in the game to an hour. I don’t want to click on the “Would you like to send an error report?” box that comes up with each crash. I want to play Black Mesa without any interruptions. Also I want to play it on Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate on a gaming PC instead of Windows XP on my Mac.</p>

<p>Wrong.<br>
Macs are not as prone to get infected, because they have a grand total of 3 ‘viruses’ or so, none of which do much. Windows does not have more bugs because it’s more popular, it’s because they have a lot more people looking for them, it’s a lot more open ended then macs, and because they’re better advertised then the bugs that macs have. If you click on one of those ads while you’re on a mac, you don’t get infected because that ad can’t do shit all to you because you’re on a mac.</p>

<p>WOW, LOL!</p>
<p>Learn to fucking read my post before replying like a smart ass, It might HELP your argument.  The fact that Mac represents less than 4% of the worldwide installed OS of computers might explain why there are fewer Mac viruses.</p>

<p>Security researchers at Symantec recently discovered a group of thousands of Mac OS X computers infected with a trojan horse application embedded in pirated copies of iWork 09.</p>
<p>The infected users had installed the software without scanning it for viruses, no doubt in part because of Apple’s commercials implying that Mac users don’t need to worry about security.</p>
<p>Once the hacker managed to get his malware installed on these zombie Mac computers, the entire group was fully under his control – and he began to use them to attack web sites, but they could be used for other, more nefarious purposes: like sending spam!</p>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO - Benjamin Daines was browsing the Web when he clicked on a series of links that promised pictures of an unreleased update to his computer’s operating system.</p>
<p>Instead, a window opened on the screen and strange commands ran as if the machine was under the control of someone — or something — else. Daines was the victim of a computer virus.</p>
<p>Such headaches are hardly unusual on PCs running Microsoft Corp.’s Windows operating system. Daines, however, was using a Mac — an Apple Computer Inc. machine often touted as being immune to such risks.</p>

<p>Also, any discussion on pcs being inferior due to viruses is completely and utterly irrelevant. If you are an intelligent person who knows at least something about computers and you don’t go picking fights with hackers, you will be able to go years without a virus.</p>
