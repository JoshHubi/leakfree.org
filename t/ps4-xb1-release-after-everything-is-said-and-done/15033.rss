    <title>PS4/XB1 release after everything is said and done?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ps4-xb1-release-after-everything-is-said-and-done/15033</link>
    <description>Do you guys think it is possible to release Black Mesa on consoles in the future? I used to play on PC a lot back then when Black Mesa was first released for free. Since then I&#39;ve moved completely for consoles and the PC I have here can&#39;t run sh** (sorry for the language, hahaha). I never got to play the paid version, neither the multiplayer. When Xen finally gets released, is there a possibility to launch it on Consoles? Or does Valve not allow it?</description>

            <p>the devs have said that this is never going to happen</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Will there be a Black Mesa console port?</span><br>
Nope, we are not able to do console ports for a number of reasons. Sorry!<br>

            <p>Whether or not Valve allows it is probably the least of their concerns. Porting a game to a new platform (especially, as is the case with the PS4, a platform that doesn’t even run the same graphics library as the engine you’re using*) is a huge technical undertaking.<br>
They’d also have to get their hands on devkits for the consoles, which, while they have become easier to obtain in recent years, are pretty hard to get your hands on if you don’t have a centralized office, bare minimum.<br>
And then you’d have to go through console certification, which in addition to costing money (and having to re-do it for every update and patch!) is a nightmare in and of itself (especially since both Microsoft and Sony have different checklists that would have to both be completed)</p>
<p>It’s <span class="bbcode-i">possible</span>, and it’d certainly be nice, but I wouldn’t hold your breath, since taking a PC game and putting it on consoles is a massive headache even with the new architecture similarities in current-gen consoles, and requires resources the devs may or may not have at this time or any time in the future.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">*Technically source does have an OpenGL renderer, as per the Mac and Linux builds of the engine, (the latter of which BM also currently has) but it’s always been focused on DirectX as its main renderer, for reasons I will never understand because it’s the least open/portable format you could possibly chose this side of… Apple’s Metal, I guess?</span>[/size]</p>
