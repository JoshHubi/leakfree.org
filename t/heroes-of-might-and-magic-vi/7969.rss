    <title>Heroes of Might and Magic VI</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/heroes-of-might-and-magic-vi/7969</link>
    <description>I figured I&#39;d post this seeing as it came out today, and I haven&#39;t seen a thread on it.

[url]https://store.steampowered.com/app/48220/[/url]

Haven&#39;t got a chance to try the demo yet. Has anyone got it? After looking at it I thought despite being 3D, it looked much more reminiscent of Heroes 2/3 when looking at the world, and the graphics seemed pretty nice (as opposed to Heroes V&#39;s graphics, which I really didn&#39;t like for some reason).

Thoughts/Opinions on it so far?

I loved playing Heroes 2 back in the day, still do, so I&#39;m wondering if this one&#39;s worth a purchase.</description>

            <p>Well to be fair, ubisoft doesn’t develop it, and I read that they are working on the city view and going to add it in a patch.</p>

            <p>I think that ubisoft is making old games with new graphics… they think they are 3DO. wrong! I hate this company, for them financial side is more important than making really good game. they removed city view! why? because 123412341k fat ass people demanded that, their asses were too fat to look at it… screw them. I won’t buy it.</p>

            <p>I’m certainly going to get it at one point, but I’m budgeting my games cash, and Skyrim wins out this round.</p>
<p>I’m absolutely in love with the soundtrack though. The heroes 2 grasslands theme was my favorite map theme by far, and hearing that in all of it’s remade glory made me indescribable amounts of happy. &lt;3</p>
