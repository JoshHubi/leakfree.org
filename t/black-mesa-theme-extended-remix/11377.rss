    <title>Black Mesa Theme (extended remix)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-theme-extended-remix/11377</link>
    <description>Hey lads and ladies! Like many of you here, I was listening to Black Mesa&#39;s soudtrack, and found &quot;Black Mesa Theme&quot; an amazing work of art. But I was quite sad for it being too short. I had some free time so I made this extended version of it, but It just happened to sound a bit different. Anyway, here it is..

It&#39;s is still short. But I hope you&#39;ll enjoy it anyway.  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>It sounds rather weird. Like you’ve just randomly pasted parts of the song over and over again in different places and used time stretch.</p>

<p>That is exactly what I did. It was the only way for me to try and extend the soundtrack without leading it to the end and then starting it all over again. I’m not really into remaking music and stuff, so it wouldn’t surprise me that you didn’t liked it.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for feedback guys! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Sounds like it goes a little bit off rhythm a few times.</p>
