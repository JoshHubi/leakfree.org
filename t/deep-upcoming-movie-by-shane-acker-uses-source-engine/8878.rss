Acker made his breakthrough with feature debut &quot;9,&quot; which was produced by 
Tim Burton, Timur Bekmambetov and Jim Lemley, and distributed by Focus Features in association with Relativity Media.

Like &quot;9,&quot; &quot;Deep&quot; is set in a post-apocalypse world, devastated by World War III. 
But here what&#39;s left of humanity shelters undersea in the hulks of sunken ships. 
The action adventure turns on Sullivan, a captain of a nuclear sub. 
He makes contact with a splinter group of superior scientific intelligence, the Wayfarers, which has the power to save the earth. 
But that could come at a terrible cost.

&quot;Deep&quot; was written by Jack Barton Mitchell, and produced by Brown Bag&#39;s Darragh O&#39;Connell 
and Gregory R. Little, who heads Brown Bag&#39;s L.A. production office.

Its working budget is E15 million ($18.7 million), high-end for Europe but low for the U.S., 
O&#39;Connell said at a Work in Progress presentation Friday at the Annecy festival.

The contained budget reflects Dublin-based Brown Bag&#39;s alliance with Valve whose hit titles include the &quot;Half Life&quot; and &quot;Portal&quot; franchises.

Valve&#39;s tools and technologies, based on its Source game engine, 
allow Acker and Brown Bag real-time rendering, and editing, simplified character animation and economical lighting, O&#39;Connell said.

He added that game engine production also facilitates a vidgame version, 
and Valve&#39;s online game distrib network, Steam, offers an alternative way of distributing a movie.</description>

            <p>I’ll give it a look when it comes out, although I’m sceptical to how well it will perform. Game environments are typically designed differently to move environments for obvious reasons.<br>
The possibility of new water for the source engine excites me more than a movie/game.</p>
<p>I am interested though.</p>

            <p>Water rendering has certainly seen some improvement in that video. I wonder if some of that material will get into the base engine content. I could really use some good water effects for my projects…</p>

<p>Looks a bit dodgy compared to valve’s own stuff tbh, but I’m sure this is all heavy WIP.</p>

            <p>That was pretty underwhelming, both visually &amp; narratively. While I like the idea of production sets doubling as playable levels I can’t imagine the environments in the trailer would make for very good level design. (assuming it’s on foot &amp; of the shooter variety)</p>
<p>Are they implementing dynamic water into the engine? It looks rather… chunky. I also don’t care much for the art style.</p>

            <p>That’s pretty fucking cool actually. I was a fan of Shane Acker ever since I saw his original 9 short film. The feature was rough around the edges, but for a first (and for being so fucking ambitious) it turned out great.</p>
