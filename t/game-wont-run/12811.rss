    <title>Game wont run</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-wont-run/12811</link>
    <description>Hiya, I downloaded the torrent of the game and installed it then downloaded Source SDK Base 2007 and tried running black mesa but nothing happens when i click run game from within steam. then when i reclick it it tells me the app is already running. (nothing showing as running in task manager) If i try to run source SDK base 2007 instead of black mesa the same thing happens.

then if i try to close down steam it wont let me because it says source sdk base 2007 is still running and wait for it to shutdown yet it never does so i have to use task manager to close steam.

im using windows 7 home premium 64bit, nvidia gtx 570 with recent drivers.


things ive tried to solve this:

i deleted source sdk base 2007 then ran steam as administrator and downloaded sdk base 2007 again and tried running black mesa again while running steam as administrator but same thing.

i right clicked on sdk base 2007 and did the verify integrity and it said it was ok.

i deleted the contents of the appcache folder inside the Steam folder and tried running the game again but same problem.

any ideas?</description>

            <p>UPDATE 2:</p>
<p>found this thread:<br>
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/420/discussions/0/864971765497379056/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/app/420/discussions/0/864971765497379056/</a></p>
<p>i tried changing the gameinfo.txt inside the BMS folder like he suggests and after some tinkering i was able to get half life to run by clicking the play button for black mesa, however it seemed to just be running half life 1 source, not black mesa.</p>

            <p>update:</p>
<p>ive messed about with the compatabilty options now, picking win xp service pack 3 but no different.</p>
<p>then i ticked the box ‘run this program as admin’ in the properties for hl2.exe in the source base sdk 2007 folder and then when i run black mesa it says,</p>
<p>“can’t find background image materials/console/startup_loading.vtf”</p>
<p>and it kicks me out, a google search reveals this to be a problem with source based mods, i copied a startup screen from counter strike go over into the folder and named it startup_loading.vtf to try and trick it but then i get the error. "engine error. Error loading file Resource/SourceScheme.res</p>

            <p>I just deleted the folder now and reinstalled it, tried running it and i get the little loading sign for a couple of seconds then nothing. i clicked ‘play game’ again and it said black mesa is already running. task manager shows hl2.exe *32 running but using very little memory (just under 2Mb i think it was)</p>
<p>doesnt let me close steam until i kill the process tree of hl2.exe</p>
<p>F:\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS</p>
<p>Size: 7.06 GB (7,590,138,569 bytes)<br>
size on disk: 7.13 GB (7,659,429,888 bytes)<br>
29,421 Files, 750 Folders</p>
<p>how do i change compatability mode?</p>
<p>this is the only steam related mod ive ever tried, if you reccomend another one i will try it to see if it can help narrow down the problem.</p>

            <p>What’s the size of the bms folder?<br>
Have you tried deleting the mod folder and installing it again?<br>
Did you try to set the compatibility mode to lower versions of windows?<br>
Do other mods work fine (or is that the only mod you’ve ever tried)?</p>
