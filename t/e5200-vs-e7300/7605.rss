    <title>E5200 vs E7300</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/e5200-vs-e7300/7605</link>
    <description>basically, I was looking at the Dead Island requirements which say the CPU required is a Core 2 Duo 2.66ghz. I have a Pentium Dual Core E5200 overclocked to 2.8ghz and I was wondering how the performance of that would compare to the Core 2 Duo, and if so, how much might I have to overclock it more so it gets to the same performance? thankyou  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Good thing is, you can get low-medium end core 2 duos now a days for the price of chips second hand or new, so, waiting for your gpu and ram specs, might not be a bad thing taking the chance for a small upgrade</p>

            <p>A strong GPU is much more important than your processor. What’s your graphics card and how much RAM do you have, and what resolution would you be playing at?</p>
<p>And a core 2 duo is actually quite a bit faster clock-for-clock than a Pentium Dual Core, but in gaming the difference should be negligible (maybe a few frames per second).</p>

            <p>The requirements should not be seen as a hard restriction that won’t let you play the game. Don’t bother the game will run fine.</p>
<p>Ah yes, you can’t just overclock your cpu to make it faster than the E7200.</p>
