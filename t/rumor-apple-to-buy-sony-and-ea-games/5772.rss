    <title>RUMOR: Apple to buy Sony, and EA Games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rumor-apple-to-buy-sony-and-ea-games/5772</link>
    <description>In all seriousness, I laughed to myself when I read the title for this article when I came across it. Once I viewed the source, I quickly shut the hell up and started taking it seriously. Although this is just a rumour and more or less just analyst speculation; there&#39;s a good chance that the position of power in terms of the video game industry will drastically change if this shit goes down.

Apple has been racking in the dough for quite some time now. They&#39;re estimated to have 51 billion dollars of crisp cash to blow with zero debt as well. They have been pulling in billions of dollars quarter after quarter so I&#39;m sure all that money is starting to burn a significant hole in their collective pockets. So what do you do with 51 big tymer bills in the bank? Why not go on a shopping spree. Apple has been getting seriously involved in the gaming scene offering mostly casual games for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. With the potential acquisition of EA and Sony they&#39;ll have a huge impact on the gaming industry and could position themselves at the top of the list in a short amount of time. EA is the second biggest game publisher and we all know what Sony has to offer in terms of their existing client base with a huge hand in the hardware game.

Apple, or Jobs more specifically, did not comment directly as to what their short or long term plans are relating to their excessive cash positioning but that didn&#39;t stop the New York Times from chiming in on the subject. At Apple&#39;s press conference last week, Jobs went on to make the following statement that got everyone up in Wall Street in a tizzy:
[quote]
We’d like to continue to keep our powder dry because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future,

Kaufman Brothers have gone as far as to link EA, Netflix and even Facebook as potential acquisition targets.

Leading financial magazine Barron&#39;s is reportedly suggesting that Apple faces &quot;speculation that it could acquire Adobe Systems, Sony, or even Walt Disney&quot;.
[/quote]
There are also some investors that just don&#39;t see the point. Take into consideration the purchase of Netflix. iTunes already has 160 million accounts. Netflix would just be a drop in the bucket with their 15 million current subscribers in comparison. Apple has also done extremely well entering new markets on its own so they don&#39;t exactly need to make any of these acquisition to remain competitive or expand. But man wouldn&#39;t that be something. The biggest and smartest move would probably be picking up Facebook due to it&#39;s 500 million subscribers and the robust advertising ecosystem that comes along with it.

If you&#39;re interested in reading the entire article I suggest you check it out over at the NY Time. I wish I had Apple money... What would you guys &quot;acquire&quot; with 51 billion bucks in the bank?

<p>First of all that is purely a matter of opinion. And second of all android is superior to iPhone in absolutely no way. There both equal.</p>
<p>I have tried developing apps for both platforms, and let me tell you as a developer. I greatly prefer iPhone. Developing apps for iPhone is like developing a app for Mac. You have to go threw Apple to get it published. But it’s just so much cleaner than a windows program. Now developing for android is like programming a program for windows. It’s sloppy and messy.

<p>I can confirm this. I wanted to buy an e-pad, which is a tablet very similar to ipad that comes with android, and I thought it should be a good deal. Instead of buying it and regretting later, I decided to download the virtual machine to test android in my PC. I thought that, since android is based on Linux, it should look like Linux, including being compatible with its programs, and that it would include gcc, make and other development tools that would allow me to compile simple Linux programs for the android.</p>
<p>I found out that was not the case. I went more or less through the development tutorial, I even managed to fix the snake program so it would running my PC using the keyboard, but the development method is tiresome and not very flexible. Also, Android should be very useful for a smartphone, but not the kind of OS I expected in a tablet at all.</p>

</aside>
<p>That was a incorrect information that was not in direction of my post! So i deleted it. And said that! It is not about intelligent!<br>
Post and information must be on same direction. I am not a wiki or something that MUST inform people with all of information.</p>
<p>I have a opinion and use information to reach target. True information. But not all of them.</p>
<p>But about EBIT, I don’t think it is very important when we speak about buying a company by another. Every one know that Computer and Technology companies have bigger EBIT (Because of less OPEX) but it didn’t show anything about ability of apple for buying sony. I think Revenge is more important (even if they cant keep it under pillows). OPEX + EBIT = Revenge!<br>
So if a company can’t even pay needed OPEX of another company to make EBIT then buying is not possible i think!</p>
<p>But from other side, I think Asset is more important then anything when we speak about buying a company. And Total assets of sony is $137.694 billion and Apple is $47.50 billion!! So buying is impossible again! Apple must work 12 years to make total asset of sony and then if they can buy sony.</p>

            <p>As for apple and gaming, ipod apps are mostly mindless time wasters that are almost on par with Zynga. And as for macs gaming, they’re own features page says it all: <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook/features.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">macbook’s gaming capabilities shown off by a game my dad’s 8 year old computer can play.</a></p>

            <p>WTF!<br>
It is not about if apple going to buy sony or not. it is about if apple can buy sony or not.</p>
<p>Sony is not a small company with less then 500 employee! It is one of the biggest company and leader of audio and video industry!<br>
And what about apple?! it is a big company on technology industry! (and medium company at all)<br>
Do you see their Revenue or Operating income or even Employees count?! Take a look:</p>
<p>Apple:<br>
Revenue: $42.91 billion<br>
Employees: 49,400</p>
<p>Sony:<br>
Revenue: $77.205 billion (Near double of apple)<br>
Employees: 167,900 (3.5 times more then apple)</p>
<p>So let speak about if Sony want to buy apple or not! (When Sony has parts like Games studios, Sony PlayStation, Sony Pictures (Who is very near with Hollywood! You can see it when Blu-Ray win the battle of HD formats and even now in 3D revelation (named by some companies that want our money) , VAIO, Sony Ericsson and maybe as soon sPhone and sPad!! lol)</p>
<p>In other hand! Buying is not too easy! Let read Microsoft and Yahoo stories!<br>
Yahoo revenue is only 6.5 billion and Microsoft revenue is ten times more then yahoo. 62 billion. But yahoo didnt accept microsoft offer!</p>
<p>World don’t work this way!</p>
<p>Sorry for english</p>

            <p>Well, when Apple touches something, it usually turns into gold - and its the customers who decide with their wallets that make it happen. I think that if Apple will buy EA (most probably, and it’s not the first rumor about it), non-applehater customers will be happy.</p>
