    <title>user.cfg</title>

    <description>So there&#39;s a particular problem that my computer has when playing any sort of video game: it doesn&#39;t provide me with a cursor for navigating. It requires me to run every game I own in a window, where it will remember to draw a cursor.

The thing is though, my Source games have been giving me a lot of trouble in making this possible. Especially TF2. When I go into options to change by video settings to run the game in a window, it does nothing. The console tells me that &quot;user.cfg not present.&quot; and then it follows that up with &quot;Writing user.cfg&quot;.

That is a load of bs. It has never once produced that file.

Doing this within the game is, obviously, impossible. And I&#39;ve looked high and low for this file so that I can find it myself. If anyone could give me any pointers, that would be fantastic.</description>

<p>Do you have mouse trails turned on?<br>
If so, access your mouse properties through the control panel and remove the option to display device pointer trails.<br>
Restart Steam and see if problem is  solved.</p>

<p>Holy balls. That fixed my entire problem. …Not with changing from fullscreen to windowed, but that isn’t even a problem anymore. I can see my mouse now, and that is super special awesome! Thanks!</p>

<p>I’ve not clue about that user.cfg file, though I do know you can run the game in windowed, and set the resolution with the Steam startup command -windowed, -h [height], -w [width].</p>
<p>For example, <code>
-windowed -w 1920 -h 1080
</code></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Aha, that’s very useful. I first tried that and it got it to be windowed. I was able to make it permanent from there.</p>

            <p>I have no idea if this would work, but why not create an empty user.cfg and leave it in there to see if it actually does anything.</p>
