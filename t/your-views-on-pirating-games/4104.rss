    <description>:pirate:
So, in light of my recent pirating of WC3: FT, I&#39;ve wondered how others think of this.  I have pirated a lot of games.  A LOT.  Mostly games I play on an emulator cause you cant find em on store shelves anymore.  This one&#39;s the least newest game I&#39;ve pirated, which makes me ashamed of myself.  

I only did it for Dota, so yeah.[/SIZE]

So how do you guys feel about pirating old games that are hard to find?
