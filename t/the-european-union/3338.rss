    <title>The European Union</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-european-union/3338</link>
    <description>I was contemplating the recent economic issues the EU has been having as of late relating to Greece, and it got me wondering what will happen to the EU.
As I see it, with a standardized currency comes the need for a centralized and powerful government, otherwise individual countries can go ahead and do stupid stuff, screw over the currency, and every other european will be near powerless to stop it. However, in order to do that, you would have to effectively make the EU into a country, and what are now countries states, and I suspect some of its members would be less than happy to give up their sovereignty. 
So, what do you see happening to the EU in the next few decades?</description>

<p>There are alot of misconceptions about the US/China debt relationship and what it would mean if China stopped buying our debt. What exactly are you talking about? We’ve never been at risk of being at war with China.</p>

<p>The Germans might have lost, but their military excellence have claimed an enormous amount of lives on the allies side, the Soviets alone lost three times more men and materials due to our good friend Stalin whom for some reason is being praised as a hero. Sending endless hordes of T-34’s into well organized Tiger tank collums surely wasn’t the brightest of Soviet military tactics. When they finally pushed Germany back out of Russia they lost five tanks for every German tank.</p>
<p>But even that doesn’t top the failure of France, letting Hitler build up his armies and then defeating France using the new but highly effective Blitzkrieg doctrine when Germany had a smaller force at the time. :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>Well yes, but it wasn’t exactly taken in the way that countries are being taken. There was an alliance of European explorers that ventured into the Congo with the purpose of research and knowledge regarding the country. Leopold II was immensely interested in the land.</p>
<p>All this caused a bit of a fuzz in Europe, so at the Berlin Convention, they gave the biggest part of the land to Belgium, and some smaller territories to the other European nations. Leopold II was just happy because he thought that this “expansion” would make Belgium a “bigger” nation.</p>
<p>Few years later, however, rubber became a “hot” product, there was high demand, and it just so happened that the Congo had plenty of rubber trees, so Leopold II drained the land of its natural resources and it hasn’t recovered since.</p>

            <p>Actually, the Belgians didn’t… We’ve been subject to invasion very often (by the Dutch, for example, mere hours after declaring independence), and we apparently had plans to invade France at some point (but our king decided against it because France was still to strong at that point).</p>
<p>Apart from that, we haven’t tried to take over anything (Congo was given to us).</p>
