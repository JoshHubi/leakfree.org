    <title>Reactor finale: Game doesn&#39;t fail if you kill the scientist [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/reactor-finale-game-doesnt-fail-if-you-kill-the-scientist-fixed/10015</link>
    <description>In the massive encounter right before Xen, a scientist walks out onto a catwalk to explain that he must not be interrupted and Gordon shouldn&#39;t enter the beam early. He then walks over to a glass-walled control pod to work the generator right before flying aliens spawn in.

That scientist can be killed (I tranquillised him) but the game doesn&#39;t end like it would in the original Half-Life. There, you&#39;d get &quot;Subject failed to utilise mission-critical assets&quot; or some such over a black screen, and they you&#39;d be bounced back to your most recent save. Here, the game is simply stuck in an unwinnable state. And I can actually save in this state.

I think killing the scientist before he gets to his controls should end the game.</description>

            <p>Bugger the scientist, they should make it so all he has to do is program the computer to set the portal, then run out of the room so I don’t have to defend his sorry ass.</p>

            <p>Killing the scientists in the room before that ended the game as it should, but I guess they missed this guy.</p>
