    <title>General Portal 2 Thread/Thoughts [Spoilers]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/general-portal-2-thread-thoughts-spoilers/6995</link>
    <description>There&#39;s so many threads about people interpreting parts of Portal 2, yet there doesn&#39;t appear to be any threads about what people thought of the game.  
[align=center][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]SPOILER ALERT[/SIZE][/align]

If don&#39;t want to bother reading my experiances playing the game, skip to the red TL;DR.  

I thought the game was very well made.  At the beginning I wasn&#39;t very impressed and could sort of predict how everything was ending up.  But when you first face GLADoS after disabling her turrets and neurotoxin.  I was thinking that after Wheatly gained control, GLADoS would find a way of gaining partial control of the facility and you would find yourself in the middle of a way being waged between Wheatly and GLADoS.  Yet when Wheatly betrays you, it didn&#39;t come as a surprise, but more as a realization  and a &quot;I see what you did there Valve&quot; moment.  

What I loved about the game the most is how it takes you through the old testing chambers of Apeture Science.  These all help you gain an understanding of the history of Apeture as well, it&#39;s relations to Black Mesa, and how it became what it is today (Before GLADoS&#39;s  take over).  On a side note it makes me hope Episode 3 adds on to this story and how it looked from Black Mesa&#39;s point of view.  

The final test chambers and Boss battle with Wheatly are my honest to god favorite parts of the game.  I enjoy the test chambers mostly because of how you can visually see Apeture falling apart into flames and to hear GLADoS&#39;s reactions to it.  

The final battle with Wheatly, though, was a bit easier than I would have liked/  Admittedly, though, it took me a while to figure out what to do and got the last personality sphere on with less than 10 seconds left, so that made it a challenge enough for me at the time.  But the moon thing kinda blew me away when it happened.   Mostly because it was almost 3 am, I just wanted to finally finish Portal 2, when I was on the ground, unable to move, I had no idea what to do.  In fact, I kept shooting the portal gun at Wheatly in hopes that it would do something.  Finally, I just shot at the moon because I couldn&#39;t think of anything else to shoot at.  I literally shat bricks when I saw a twinkle on the moon, suddenly found everything being sucked into the portal on earth.  The Apollo stuff was also pretty cool, really liked that.  And the ending was really nice, especially with the Companion Cube being shot out.  And the thing at the very end with Wheatly and the Space personality sphere made me laugh so loud.  

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]TL;DR
My overall impressions:
Pros: Continued the funny, dark humor that was in Portal 1 to an even greater level.  Looks a lot more nicer than original.  Story didn&#39;t suck
Cons: Basically made markings showing you where portals had to be made.  Also I felt like you were more limited by where you could put portals, and that in some spots it would automatically put it in a certain way.  Took away some of the challenge.  

Well there&#39;s my two cents.  Feel free to criticize and tell yours too.</description>

</aside>
<p>to further support this, one of the early released spoilers contained an “email” about different types of test subjects and how to “motivate them”  it went over how psychos dont do the test the just tend to whipe feces on things and cant really be motivated, the homeless would do anything for money. and that orphans should be constantly berated about not having parents, and then as an after thought CJ asks why he doesnt pull his funding from aperture mental institutions and fund more aperture orphanages.</p>

            <p>You guys obviously have never seen a Brazilian person. They’re pretty much white / look like super tanned white people. I used to know one that was whiter than me, anyways, and I’m super whitey.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Anyways, I finished Portal 2 earlier today (long before I dared go near anyone who had already finished it) and I liked it alright. I think the giant turret animal king was kind of obnoxious and pushing it, but other than that, I loved it. ESPECIALLY when you get the (albeit scorched) Companion Cube back.</p>

            <p>Portal 2 was pretty short but I didn’t feel cheated. I feel that if a game is less than 10 hours it’s short but if it’s a really high quality and fun game it makes up for it.</p>

            <p>They always do, without a exception. Recently, I’ve read that Telltale games have delayed the Jurassic Park adventure game. They even give a compensation. Those who preordered it get a free Telltale game of your choice. And what do the people? They bitch around, that they can’t play it this month.</p>
<p>The length of P2 was absolutely perfect, imo. Not too long, not too short. It was way longer than P1, as Valve said so. I’ve been completely entertained.</p>

            <p>I thought it was a pretty decent length, tbh. But I guess people will always whine and complain about something won’t they?</p>

            <p>I thought Portal 2 was way too short. Main campaign for me lasted about 7 hours, the co-op about 5. Way too short.</p>
<p>Glad I just rented it tbh.</p>

            <p>I know I don’t post here much (read: at all), but this bugged me enough to get other opinions on the matter.</p>
<p>I just played through Portal 2 and loved it. The game was well put together, gameplay was smooth and felt natural with some puzzles that had me thinking. The moon bit was pretty cool too.</p>
<p>Alas, my game was ruined by these bloody loading screens after each chamber, not to mention the cutscene at the end? I love the Half-Life series probably more than any other title, reason being the whole, “play from the character’s point of view” thing Valve’s got going on. It just kinda pissed me off. S’all.</p>

            <p>I don’t want to look any further into this. Looking up Alésia Glidewell to get that info feels weird enough, I don’t wanna get info on her parents.</p>

            <p>If her face model is of any racial relevance, she’s Brazilian and Japanese.</p>
<p>Neither of those are white.</p>

            <p>Asian guy on black girl is a very sought after in the porn world.<br>
Also I’ve never really seen Chell as Asian.  She just seemed like a dark skinned women, probably a bit middle eastern.</p>
