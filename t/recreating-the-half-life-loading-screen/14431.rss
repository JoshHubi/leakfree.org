    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/recreating-the-half-life-loading-screen/14431</link>
    <description>So would it be possible to recreate the loading screen from Half-life in Black Mesa?
[img]https://combineoverwiki.net/images/c/c4/Hl_loading.png[/img]

We could possibly use SFM to make the image, but how would someone implement it?</description>

<p>Still have no clue how to implement it, since changing those backgrounds wouldn’t hide the parts with the text on it</p>

<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If you’ll make a better version of it, replace the Half-Life name in the background pic with Black Mesa. (And add it to Workshop as well ^_^)</p>

            <p>Seriously though, Crypt, the photoshop under the joke text (the high-res Freeman fanart and the orange background) looks pretty good! You should release it, or make the files you built it from available to somebody else (not me!!) to do the same.</p>

            <p>I really loved that old loading screen  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  But I’m not sure if a modern HD remake could convey the same feel. When I look at that old image I can see just a normal scientist in a suit, who tries to escape from chaos and danger… I can even read the fear from his eyes and the pressure which is on him… his stance looks very defensive aswell. I’m sure it’s rather unlikely to see such a main character in a modern artwork. In HL2 artworks you can see some bits of fear, but HL2 Gordon and Alyx don’t look like normal persons, but more hero-like… Same with the BMDM Gordon model from steam workshop. I just prefer the original Gordon head… With classic hair, skin and eye colors, original haircut, beart and face shape. The shape of the suit helmet was also very different and looked more appropriate for a hazard suit. It’s visor was bigger and more flat. It’s throat was completely orange and ended right at the shoulder armor. All In all it was less round and didn’t look halo-like at all. It just looked like a high-tec harardous environment suit and less<br>
like a battle armor suit.</p>

            <p>I’m not entirely sure how one would go about doing it, I haven’t seen static-image loading screens since GoldSrc.<br>
But I totally support the concept! It would bring an air of vintage Half-Life.</p>
