    <title>Steam tag in forums</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-tag-in-forums/8282</link>
    <description>ok this might be the wrong section for this. The steam tag that you input in the forum posts for members. Those that have set it up anyway. Is there a way I can get a hold of that code and implement it into my own site? or at least a link to some white pages where I can code one for my own forum? any help would be appreciated. 

I love the steam forum tag and want to give my HL clan the same feature.</description>

            <p>Maybe then you’ll learn that you have to input your Steam ID number, not your steam name.</p>

            <p>I think it’s this one: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/steamprofile/source/browse/trunk/ajax/steamprofile.js?r=87" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://code.google.com/p/steamprofile/source/browse/trunk/ajax/steamprofile.js?r=87</a>.</p>
<p>Seriously, wasn’t that hard to view the source code for this site, find this line “steamprofile/steamprofile.js” and google it.</p>
