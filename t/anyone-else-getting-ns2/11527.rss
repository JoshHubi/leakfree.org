    <description>Just pre-ordered Natural Selection 2, and I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else is getting the game. Trying to get a better understanding of how the NS2-community is going to evolve you see.</description>

            <p>I played a few rounds as infantry first, so I understood most of it. The only thing that was really foreign to me was the actual interface, which is fairly well-designed.</p>
<p>The one thing that I can’t figure out is how the hell you get ARCs to fire. The controls make no sense.</p>
<p>Edit: Plus, some more experienced members of my team were sometimes telling me what to do via voice chat. That definitely helped.</p>

            <p>So, after failing at moderately marine for a while as marine, I decided to randomly give Marine Commander a try, and I’ve since realized two important things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lag really doesn’t matter when you’re playing as commander, since you don’t really need to be prefectly accurate or quick about anything.</li>
<li>I’m really, <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> good at this. Each time I was able to play commander from the start, we won spectacularly. The best part is that I never looked at a tutorial; I just picked up the menus on the fly after a few rounds as infantry.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now I simply can’t get enough of this game.</p>

            <p>As I understand it, the latest generation of integrated graphics is surprisingly capable.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I don’t know how anyone could manage playing this with integrated graphics.</p>
<p>Although, having a CPU in the 3.0 Ghz and above range vastly improves performance. My friend OC’d his CPU to 3.9 GHz and has a 580 and it doesn’t dip below 60 maxed.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I think NS2 had around 45,000 people in the closed beta, and actually a lot more then that at retail.</p>
<p>Also, the community is actually really good and they help new people quite a bit, so it should help any new players who like the game to stick around for a while.</p>
<p>Even though I played NS1 a long time ago, it was very little and when I came to NS2 I didn’t know shit, but you ask and people really do help. I think they even had a bunch of Beta players that got designated as instructors specifically to help rookies.</p>
<p>Plus the devs aren’t exactly looking to make a ton of games, this is the one they want to work on so they will be supporting it with new content, updates and fixes, and new maps for a while.</p>

            <p>It won’t be dead next year. NS1 still had/has players after over 10 years. There are a lot of NS vets that have switched over and this will be going into competitive play as well if I’m not mistaken. Not to mention tons of people have already been playing ns2 for like two years in the beta. The community is definitely a big part of this game.</p>

<p>Well I see some guys running around the map telling the commander what to build and what the team needs, or telling everyone to attack with them (but not saying where) and if the commander isn’t sending waypoints, which many don’t unfortunately, then I’m lost. And I’d like to know how they choose to prioritize where to attack and when so I can start doing it without needing signals every 30 seconds.</p>

            <p>Quad at 3.5 and a 670. I heard it does need optimization but I should get decent framerates at least I would imagine.</p>

            <p>How are your specs? It still needs optimization (the new tech they added was a really bad idea to do right before release) so if you have a multicore CPU with a lower clock speed (below 2.9) it might hurt a bit.</p>

            <p>Anyone who was in the beta got a free copy to give to a friend. I bought the beta in a christmas special a while back, so I got 2 copies with beta access for the price of one, so I basically got 3 free copies, 1 deluxe, and 2 standard - 2 of which I have given to my friends (1 is afraid he will suck at playing so he hasn’t played yet, the other has been quite busy) and I have 1 more which my sister wants, but I’m not sure if I want to give it to her yet.</p>
