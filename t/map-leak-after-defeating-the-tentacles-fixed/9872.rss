    <title>map leak after defeating the tentacles [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/map-leak-after-defeating-the-tentacles-fixed/9872</link>
    <description>In Blast Pit, after defeating the tentacles and going down the ladder, there is a map leak to the right of the ladder (I believe it is only on the map that loads when you are on the ladder, but I could be wrong).

I have an image of the leak attached.

            <p>To be fair, it’s not a proper “leak” in source mapping terminology, could even be absent in the editor but only shows up after compile. A leak would produce many more bugs such as fullbright and no VVIS optimizations.</p>

<p>I Did have this same problem, but after moving slightly down the ladder it resolved and vanished.</p>

<p>it only seems to resolve itself because of the “hall of mirrors” effect. I have to turn on the flashlight for it to be clearly visible.</p>
