    <title>How Much Health?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-much-health/11182</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if this is the proper place to post this, so feel free to move it! 

I always forget the chapter name, but it&#39;s that moment when you&#39;re locked in a plaza and must defend yourself against a horde of HECU guys. That part sticks out in my mind as one of the hardest moments in the game. 

So, I ask the forums: how much health did you finish this moment with? Also, any memorable moments during this part? Alsoalso, feel free to talk about any other memorable moment! Screenshots get you bonus points!

(Also, my frames took a nose dive after the battle. It has never done this before. Any similar problems?)</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I died horribly the first time but beat it pretty smoothly when I knew where they spawned second time.  Granted I play the Half-Life games on Easy though.  No idea why, I can play Left 4 Dead and BioShock on the hardest difficulty but Half-Life I just suck.</p>
<p>This was certainly the hardest scene in the game though, apart from maybe the Lambda Core.  It’s easy to get overwhelmed fast if you’re not ready to jump in when it opens and everything spawns everywhere.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I died at least 6 times before passing through this one.</p>
<p>First play-through I was left with less than 10 health and zero armour.</p>
<p>Second playthrough with modified cvars went slightly better…<br>
Of course, some damage values were increased, but hgrunt health was increased up to 100+ too…</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I entered with 100|100. With my slow-advancing strategy, I got pinned down near the door. I thought I finished with 6|0, but then a stray grunt hit me to 2|0. It was close, what can I say!</p>
<p>The weird thing about Half-Life is I prefer recovering from combat more than the combat itself. I had great fun snooping around into Surface Tension for supplies until I got full health and full armor again.</p>

            <p>Well, I readjusted the reaction times, so the battle was reasonable. Surface Tension and Lambda Core were a lot more tough. That way has more sense.</p>

            <p>Did one earlier today, got out with 21 hp… it’s a custom config so their health &amp; damage is far higher than the defaults. So it’s not exactly up to par.</p>
<p>I just chucked a pair of satchels out in the center area before going through the door, took out the first set, MP5’d the other two that repelled down, nailed half the final group with the Tau Cannon, finished the rest of them off by using the MP5/shotgun.</p>

            <p>I dunno exactly, in my final run through this scene (normal difficulty) I was getting hit approximately two or three times, this scene is hard but scripted, if you know where they stand and come down it’s pretty easy. First four guys rope down, then two guys stand on the left side of the roof, two guys rope down, then four guys came through the right door, throw a satchel, blow them up, use crossbow for the others.</p>
<p>Osprey is hard. ^^</p>

<p>Y sí, I got the same frame glitch as well after the battle. Had to reload.</p>
<p>But nothing important, just a little glitch <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
