    <description>Im interested to see how many of you have younger siblings, or live with chirldren. 

I decided to start this thread because i just spent the past 3 hours killing imaginary zombies with a makeshift sniper rifle made from an old telescope for my 3 year old sister. She was absolutely convinced that the world was coming to a L4D apocalypse. NEVER PLAY VIDEO GAMES IN FRONT OF KIDS. As i am writing this she came in screaming.

<p>Belgium hey? Oh the Chocolate… For some folks here, your chocolate is better than crack cocaine. We are lucky here on the west coast of Canada… we have the 3rd highest ranked choclate maker in the world - a little shop on Bowen Island (where I visit here are there with may camera) AMAZING!!! There is also an amazing amount of truly horrid chocolate around as well. Too much wax or other fillers - BLEH!</p>

            <p>I tried to do all the right things with child one and two.  Surprise child three came along and I thought… hey, I think I wanna have fun with this one.  (Yes, I do have a mischievous streak in case ya’ll have not figured it out.)</p>
<p>So, at 3 I taught him how to fore finger/thumb/fore head “loser”, and I taught him 2 thumbs/2 fore finger “whatever”.  I also taught him how to 2 thumbs/2 fore finger “I heart you!” and how to wink with a smack of the tongue while saying “hubba hubba”.  It was all fun and games till one day…</p>
<p>At preschool he kept calling this one kid “looser” with his fingers.  Everyone laughed but the teacher didn’t appreciate the talent. So she told him “Isaac, we don’t call people loser. It hurts their feelings”.  He promptly responded with “whatever”.</p>
<p>Oh and then there was the other hilarious incident that <span class="bbcode-b"><em>I</em></span> got blamed for but is TOTALLY WRONG cuz I dont do that!!  One of the kids did something wrong and exclaimed “OH MY GOD!”. Another kid replied "My mom says “Oh my gosh!”. Another kid said "My mom says “Oh my goodness”. and MY kid Isaac said "My mom says “oh fuck!”.</p>
<p>HAHAHA!!! NO I DONT BUT THAT IS SO FUNNY!!!</p>

She would also smack me if I was being the typical child-attentionwhore, she would charge in with her slipper in her hand when I was being annoying. My mum knew how to raise kids. As a result, she has 3 sons that never broke the rules, never broke the law, never caused anyone any harm, graduated, have a job and are having a healthy and balanced life.</p>
<p>And about animals. Yes, in the animal kingdom, animals will kill that offspring. But only if they’re weak or abnormal. Apart from that, -all- animals in the wild are -the- perfect parents. But once you take them out of their natural habitat, once you start putting them away, you get issues with parenting skills not being passed on anymore, because there’s no reason why the parents should teach their young the tricks of the trade, since there’s no dangers or specific need for survival. At this point, you turned animals into humans in terms of parenting.</p>

            <p>The thing is, a lot of parents don’t even display instinct when raising kids, outside of minor things like “I know how he’s feeling” or something like that. Other mammals can rely totally on instinct to know what to do, a human has to actually LEARN how take care of its young, which is problematic when no one really knows to correct way.</p>

<p>hahaha!  oh wow… that little girl would have a very sore bottom if that happened in my house!</p>
<p>There IS that ‘fear factor’ that works wonders on those very specific destructible type behaviors.  Oh I know some of you will gasp in horror cuz I DO believe in a paddle to the buttocks.  But I for one don’t want to be the parent in the store going “honey, put the marker down, you cant draw on the tv. put it down now or else we are going to have a timeout. I am serious sweety, you really cant do that. oh now look… you are going to have to have a timeout cuz you broke it.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree with you. I believe that parents need to balance between talking and punishment. Talking is only effective once the kid is old enough to understand, and does not work always. Timeouts and restrictions may also be effective if applied correctly, but not when the kid is out of control, like that girl. When punishing your child you always have to be tough, talking sweety this and honey that (or, as it is common here, little this, little that) just won’t work. I don’t know very much about parenting, though, except the experiences I had as a son and things that I observe in other families.</p>

<p>Well, I kinda have a related, funny story. I have always been very distracted. Once a kindergarten teacher gave my class a test which consisted of drawing five straight lines several times. I did it a few times and found it was boring, it was so easy. I began to tell some kind of story to a friend at my side while moving the pencil randomly on the paper, showing him what was happening. The result was a mess, a very round zero made with a pen on top of the test and the teacher trying to ask me how could I have failed in such a simple task. I was ashamed and couldn’t say.</p>
<p>The director of the kindergarten (who, to us, kids, was a very angry, tall woman) spoke to my mother, saying that she suspected that I had some kind of mental problem, that I probably could never go any further than 2nd grade. There was a class with children 2 or 3 years old that could only make indistinguishable noises, I was 5 and they put me there. I was always very quiet and innocent, so I didn’t feel angry and thought it was normal.</p>
<p>Some time passed, and I was told by my mother that a doctor would check if it was everything OK with my dreams while I slept. That in my mind was an adventure, the doctor would be able to see my dreams, so I would dream with a super hero who I invented and amaze the doctor. My mother took me to a neurologist. The neurologist told me to lay down on the couch and put some sensors or whatever on my head. It never occurred to me what was really going on. I don’t remember if I really had to sleep though.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, I remember that, some day, back to the kindergarten, the door to the class of younger children closed before I could enter, and some teacher there told me to go to the line with my old class. And so did I without questioning. Never went back to the babies’ class.</p>
<p>Nowadays I am in the 2nd year… studying for a Master’s Degree <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I just wonder what would be the face of director of the kindergarten if she knew that.</p>

<p>I know it is a joke, but other species don’t <span class="bbcode-i">know</span> anything. They also don’t live in society, which is very different from the jungle. The problem is we need to deal with reason, not instinct, because you can’t depend on your instinct to deal with people, study, get a job…</p>

            <p>I think spanking can have value, but the flip side is, that there IS a corrilation between spanking and issues relating to self worth. That said, I am not suggesting that because a person gets a spanking that they are going to turn out messed up - I am saying that a parent has to be careful, as Catz already mentioned.</p>
<p>There are extremes to either approach to parenting. Not enough disipline, and you DO spoil a child. Disipline a child harshly, and it can cause issues with your childs world veiw.</p>
<p>For me, my kids are all grown up (pretty much) so that whole things is well behind us. Were it not, I would be very careful in using spanking, becuase I am rather a large and powerful person. The idea is connect pain to an activity - that pain certainly does not need to be a spanking. As I say, I think it being used very sparingly is best. A quick squeeze on the trapazoid works very good as well, when a quick connection with behavior and pain is needed in that moment.</p>
<p>The part that amazes me, is that punishment is also a way for a child to feel cleansed of guilt for doing things they know they shouldn’t. Again, a person has to be VERY careful with this… evey child is different. Each child needed to be dealt with differently. Some kids are going to push the limits many time before they trust that you are capable of protecting them. (That is why many kids push teh limits in the first place)</p>
<p>I would rather redirrect a kid from potential problems, than to let them have it. Better to keep a kid happy and willing to comply, than to have to take it to an extreme.</p>
