    <description>Hi all. I have downloaded BM and unzipped it and tried to set it up. It gets as far as saying &quot;Have you installed &quot;BlackMesa7z?&quot; I have this in the download that I got and I have unzipped this but a window comes up with just a list of folders and other things. Where do I install all this, I take it it needs extracting somewhere then I unzip and run the BlackMesa setup.exe?

Any help appreciated, thanks. 

Oh and I also have Steam installed and the Source SDK Base 2007 and 2006 installed in there. I click on &quot;Play&quot; and get to the video Stress Test thing then that&#39;s it! The BlackMesa is not in my game list as I can&#39;t unzip it because it keeps asking if I have 7z installed which I have but don&#39;t know where that goes! Cheers.</description>

            <p>You shouldnt need an orange game in order to get this thing going.</p>
<p>Question regarding this part:<br>
3. Downloaded the BlackMesa.zip (which includes the BlackMesa.md5, BlackMesa_Setup.exe and BlackMesa.7z) in one Folder and opened it with WinRar<br>
3.1. I startet BlackMesa_Setup.exe from WinRar and after extraction the installation Window opened.</p>
<p>Are you saying you extracted all three files first from the WinRar file (to your desktop for example) and then clicked on the .exe, or did you click on the .exe while it was still inside the WinRar file?</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a similiar problem that can´t be resolved with the information above.</p>
<p>Some information in advance: I have never installed Games in Steam before and are not used to Steam. So as I researched I first did some mistakes with the installation. :fffuuu:</p>
<p>I think I got the procedure now but the Game wont start <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
So this is what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Installed Steam and logged in</li>
<li>Installed SDK 2007 an started it</li>
<li>Downloaded the BlackMesa.zip (which includes the BlackMesa.md5, BlackMesa_Setup.exe and BlackMesa.7z) in one Folder and opened it with WinRar<br>
3.1. I startet BlackMesa_Setup.exe from WinRar and after extraction the installation Window opened.<br>
3.2. I choosed Steam/SteamApps/sourcemods/BMS as folder for the installation. (Steam was opend the whole time)<br>
3.3. After the installation the game appeared immediately in my steam bib but when I click on “start game” it shows only a window “Black Mesa will be started” and then the window close itself and nothing happens. I looked on my taskmanager and found out that steam is trying to open a “hl2.exe” which is probably the SDK2007 file?? :meh: I restarted my Computer twice and still nothing happens.</li>
</ol>
<p>I really don´t know where the mistake is <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> Maybe you can help me out?

            <p>Well I resinstalled it all and I can now get it running from the Steam library!! I have no idea how its done it!! Thanks for your help  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><em><strong>EDIT</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, almost three hours since I loaded it up I have had to stop and sleep!</p>
<p>What an awesome game this is. I remember it well from first time around and it looks brilliant with the make over, a job well done. It’s great remembering the old game and where I am at in this one (it’s the same I know) but there are bits where I suddenly remember what to do, where to go etc, it’s like going to back to work in an old job, it all starts coming back eventually!</p>
<p>It takes me back to the old 56k modem days and Team Fortress on dial-up! Laggy wasn’t in it! Used to play with some lads from work against a load of army boys based in Germany and we thought it was brilliant we could play like that, used to get called a “Spammer” for blindly throwing grenades everywhere! anyhow, great times and a subject for a different thread  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hi AC3D, many thanks for your reply here, it is much appreciated indeed.</p>
<p>I have all files in one folder on my desktop. Here is what I have;</p>
<p>Folders;<br>
Bin<br>
Cfg<br>

expresions<br>
maps<br>
materials<br>
media<br>
models<br>
particles<br>
resourse<br>
scenes<br>
scripts<br>
shaders<br>
sound</p>
<p>Then on their own directly under that list of folders is;</p>
<p>base.fgd<br>
BlackMesa.md5<br>
BlackMesa-Setup<br>
bms.fgd<br>
detail.bvsp<br>

            <p>Do you have the three files in the same location?<br>
I was able to produce the same error message as yours by moving BlackMesa.7z to a different location of BlackMesa-Setup.exe, the three install files listed above can be placed anywhere on your computer, but they must be in the same location together in order for the setup to work properly, you could create a folder called “Black Mesa Install” and move these three files into that folder to ensure this, and then try running the .exe</p>
<p>If for some reason you still get the error message, I suggest you go for the manual install, the game will be listed in Steam and play the same either way.</p>
<p>Make sure Steam, and any torrent applications are closed while attempting the easy or manual install</p>
<p>The last and worst case scenario, during the extraction in the manual install, if WinRAR displays any error message, then the files are incomplete or corrupted, and Black Mesa must be re-downloaded</p>

            <p>If your download has these files:<br>
BlackMesa.md5<br>
BlackMesa-Setup.exe<br>
BlackMesa.7z</p>
<p>and you have made sure <span class="bbcode-b">Source SDK Base 2007</span> is installed and up to date, close Steam, you have two ways to install:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Easy:</span> Run <span class="bbcode-b">BlackMesa-Setup.exe</span> and follow the instructions</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Manual:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Install <span class="bbcode-b">WinRAR</span> <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm</a> (just download the top x86 32-bit one if you don’t know which one to use)</li>
<li>On your computer, go to (yoursteamfolder)\steamapps\sourcemods</li>
<li>In the “sourcemods” folder, create a new folder named “<span class="bbcode-b">BMS</span>”</li>
<li>Click the Start Menu, type “<span class="bbcode-b">Winrar</span>” and press enter</li>
<li>In <span class="bbcode-b">WinRAR</span>, click File, Open Archive, find BlackMesa.7z and double-click it</li>
<li>Click the <span class="bbcode-b">Extract To</span> button near the top</li>
<li>In the <span class="bbcode-b">Extract To</span> window, find the BMS folder you created in step 1 and double-click it, then click OK</li>
<li>When WinRAR has finished extracting, close it</li>
<li>Run Steam</li>
<li>Hopefully Black Mesa will be in your <span class="bbcode-b">Games List</span> now</li>

            <p>Hi all. I have downloaded BM and unzipped it and tried to set it up. It gets as far as saying "Have you installed “BlackMesa7z?” I have this in the download that I got and I have unzipped this but a window comes up with just a list of folders and other things. Where do I install all this, I take it it needs extracting somewhere then I unzip and run the BlackMesa setup.exe?</p>
<p>Any help appreciated, thanks.</p>
<p>Oh and I also have Steam installed and the Source SDK Base 2007 and 2006 installed in there. I click on “Play” and get to the video Stress Test thing then that’s it! The BlackMesa is not in my game list as I can’t unzip it because it keeps asking if I have 7z installed which I have but don’t know where that goes! Cheers.</p>
