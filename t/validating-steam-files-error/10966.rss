    <title>Validating Steam Files Error</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/validating-steam-files-error/10966</link>
    <description>I have been playing Black Mesa for a few days now, and now every time I try to start it up, it says it is &quot;Validating Steam Files&quot; It then says Validation 100% complete, but gives me an error message on top of that which says, &quot;The Steam servers are currently too busy to handle your request please try again later.&quot; I have looked all over, and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any fix for this. Am I just out of luck and have to reinstall the whole thing?</description>

<p>Same problem here, I am running on Windows 7, Half Life 2 is launching properly, but for some reason Black Mesa won’t launch due to Steam servers being too busy to validate my files …</p>
<p>I found that reinstalling Black Mesa fixes the file validation problem, but this is quite annoying as the problem shows up each time I restart my computer :’(</p>
<p>Did anyone found a solution to this ?</p>

<p>Reinstall did NOT fix the problem for me :’(</p>

            <p>This MAY be a <span class="bbcode-b">Steam</span> problem :meh:</p>
<p>Wonder if ‘they’ have an <span class="bbcode-b">automatic validation</span> scheme depending on when a game is installed or the date of the files &gt; <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
