    <title>Porting Opposing Force or Blue Shift to Source?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/porting-opposing-force-or-blue-shift-to-source/12491</link>
    <description>I was curious, is it possible to port an older GoldSrc game such as  Opposing Force or Blue Shift to the Source engine similar to Half-Life:   Source?  I figured that it might be a neat project to look into in my  spare time.  I honestly thought the Source port of HL1 was pretty decent  and the concept of updating a game to that extent really intrigued me.

So do any  of you know if it&#39;s possible?  If so, what would be involved?  Would it  be as simple as taking out the GoldSrc maps, converting them to Hammer, then adding in all of the game&#39;s other assets?

I wouldn&#39;t be distributing the game if I could get it to work.  My only intention for this would be for something me to do over the next few weeks.</description>

            <p>Plus, the Source version of HL doesn’t support all the original game’s mods. So yeah, kinda pointless unless you MUST use Source for something (like demo recording, if you’re Ross Scott).</p>

            <p>The specific purpose of Half-Life: Source was to show to modders how easy it was to port content from the gldscr engine to source engine.  So yes a port is possible.  The problem is having the pre-compiled game code for non-stock half-life code.</p>
<p>The question is, why port them over? Most people tell others to when buying a copy of HL to buy the basic one because there is barely any advantage to it.</p>

            <p>In addition to recompiling maps, you’d have to convert the textures, recompile models, rig them properly and add source entites and sprites to the maps. Some of the models and textures you can get from hl :s ource though.</p>

<p>It’s called the compile button.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
They’re already BSPs, just not <span class="bbcode-i">Source</span> BSPs. Not sure how you’d go about converting that without decompiling the maps.</p>
<p>Of course, you’d have to decompile the maps anyway to add stuff like physics and such.</p>
<p>It’s definitely <span class="bbcode-i">possible</span>, but you’ll be in for a major headache as far as the maps go, unless you can manage to get the source files from Valve. (Or Gearbox, if they still have a copy)</p>
<p>Model decompiles are more accurate, usually, but you’d need to set up each character model to ragdoll properly if you want to take full advantage of the porting process- that’s a pain when you’re on your own, though you can probably find some documentation for it somewhere.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Nono, he’s talking about porting stock Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Nothing to do with the remakes.</p>
<p>At the very least, you’ll have to convert all the maps into BSPs (which I hear is really easy, there’s a built in function in Hammer that does that), and then you’ll probably have to make entities in your new source code (especially for the Race X aliens, which definitely don’t exist in the publicly available version of Source).</p>
