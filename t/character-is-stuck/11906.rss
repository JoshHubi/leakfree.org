    <description>Hi, well I saved immediately after to plug the cable (1 of 2 necessary to start the electricity and use it to kill the big guy that is invulnerable to bullets), the problem is that now i&#39;m stuck, i mean the character cannot moves he&#39;s blocked by the cable! No crouch, no jump, no crouch jump and doesnt move forward o backward. There is a cheat code for the console to reduce collision point or whatever it name is, and i can go trought the cable? Please help me my last savepoint is in the start of the chapter. =(</description>

            <p>In the console (hit the ~ key):<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">sv_cheats 1</span></span>   turns cheats on<br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">noclip</span></span>    Allows the player to pass through anything</p>
<p>Use “noclip” again to turn it off to resume normal movement.  Use “sv_cheats 0” to turn cheats off.</p>
