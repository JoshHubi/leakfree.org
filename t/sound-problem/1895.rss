    <title>Sound Problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sound-problem/1895</link>
    <description>I was wondering if someone could help me out with an odd problem I&#39;ve had with HL2 and HL2: DM. The thing is, the games run fine, but the sound doesn&#39;t work. I can&#39;t think of any other way to describe it. There are no sounds. Dead silence, like the speakers are turned off. In all of my other Steam games, the sound works fine. Just not HL2 and HL2: DM. I checked the in-game options menus and stuff, but past that, I have no clue what to do. It&#39;s on a machine I don&#39;t really use anymore, but if I could fix it, that would be great, if for no other reason than curiosity.

P.S.: There seem to be many grammar problems with this post, but I&#39;m too tired to work out what they are. 

P.P.S. This should be in the Help thing! Sorry...</description>

            <p>I was playing DM once and got killed by a grenade, which produced the ringing sound. Unfortunately it didn’t stop, and only went away when I disconnected.</p>
<p>Dunno if that’s related or not.</p>

            <p>Update your sound drivers, video drivers and your bios, then see if it works.</p>
