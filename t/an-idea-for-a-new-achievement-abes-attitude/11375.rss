[QUOTE=Grey Acumen]
So far, I&#39;ve only been unable to save the scientists that keep getting eaten by the vents (bodycount = +4) and teh scientist that falls from the ladder in the elevator shaft (bodycount = +1) There&#39;s also the scientist that kills the headcrab at the beginning of the game before getting attacked by another, but I SHOULD be able to save him, since it is possible to grab a flare, and toss it at the headcrab before it attacks him, but the headcrab just doesn&#39;t register the hit, so (bodycount = +1)
[/QUOTE]
This post gave me an idea for a new achievement:

[b]Abe&#39;s attitude[/b]

Bring n scientists(or barneys) from point A to B

n: number of npc you have to escort.

title: a reference to [url=&#39;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe_(Oddworld)&#39;]Abe&#39;s oddysee/exoddus[/url]
![](upload://6WhtKvANakvj8eVn9J8brM6qB3R.jpeg)

I haven&#39;t figure out yet which part of BM would fit...

I was thinking at  Office complex chapter...

[b]What do you think?[/b]
have you a better title for the ach.?
have you an idea where place it?

I Hope they&#39;re gonna add this to Steam release...</description>

            <p>Yes office complex would also be a great place for escort achievements…</p>
<p>And also not to mention achievements for saving npc scientists and security guards that can be killed in scripted events some of these mpc’s are saveable</p>

<p>I doubt that devs will do it…<br>
Maybe they can use some existing dialog…</p>
<p>I was thinking at something easier to develop:</p>
<p>here is some ideas</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Abe’s attitude</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span class="bbcode-b">Bring n scientists(or barneys) to the end of a map </span></li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Gather a group of n npc</span><br>
[NO CHEATS!]</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">Escort n npc to a vending machine</span><br>
(vending machine= birds portals in abe’s games…lol!)</li>

            <p>not a bad idea for an achievement… It would have been good to have more purpose to keeping scientisi and Security guards alive for a reason other than an achievement…</p>
<p>To create a special piece of dialog somthing to happen and get an achievement for it would be better</p>

            <p>Personally, I was leaning more towards “For SCIENCE!” and just letting it be activated by them NOT being dead at the end of the chapter. There could even be one for each chapter of the game that has any scientists.</p>
<p>I don’t really like the escort mission side of things. Besides, a lot of the scientists that are supposed to die end up standing around and wont even follow you after you save their butts</p>
