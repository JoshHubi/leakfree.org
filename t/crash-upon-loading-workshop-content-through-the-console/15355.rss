    <title>Crash upon loading workshop content through the console.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-upon-loading-workshop-content-through-the-console/15355</link>
    <description>As the person I&#39;m posting this for is locked out of the forums for some strange reason, I&#39;m posting this on his behalf.

As the title says, loading workshop content from the console results in a crash (see the attached crashdump below).

Console says that it&#39;s writing to the soundcache folder prior to the crash. Lauching as administrator does not do much either...in fact, it won&#39;t even get to the writing part.

            <p>Which version of the game is being used? Maps compiled for the pre-public-beta version of Black Mesa (most of the ones on the Workshop) will crash the public beta version on startup, and vice versa.</p>
