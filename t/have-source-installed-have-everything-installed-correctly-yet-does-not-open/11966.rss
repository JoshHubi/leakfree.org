    <title>Have source installed, have everything installed correctly yet does not open</title>

    <description>Hello all,

As stated in my title; I have installed the game and uninstalled and reinstalled this game multiple times and have done the same with Source 2007. The first time I went to play the game it worked fine, ever since then, nope. What happens is I go to open the game in Steam (yes I have had steam off when installing and open then close and open again to have BMS properly in list of games) when it opens, a screen opens and immediately closes. Please anyone help with this. I&#39;ve been trying to fix this on my own, but am at a loss and decided to reach out. Please and thank you

Sincerely,
Dakupferer:[</description>
