    <description>hey guys, you might remember the thread about the hl2 citadel sounds,the screams...
i was watching [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EplIIXbLGqU&amp;feature=channel_video_title&#39;]this god of war 3 walkthrough[/url] and noticed the sounds at 11 minutes and 39 seconds, right before kratos opens the red chest and a few ties later in that video...
did valve make the sounds? i think so, but is sharing sounds between developers that common?
well i knew about several usages of hl2 fast zombie screams (even though valve just modified it for their purpose) in different movies or games, but the citadel sounds ?
i just thought his was a notable thing and wanted to share it

            <p>Videogames and movies all share large sound banks. This is common – The .357 gun sound can be heard is some old western movies.</p>

            <p>Well, I read somewhere that the Half-life series makes use of a lot of stock sounds.</p>

            <p>Didn’t notice the part about screams in your post, sorry  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  These actually sound like those HL ones and that only confirms what we are talking about.</p>
<p>This Wilhelm compilation is nice, but on the other hand pretty sad though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt9VT2wfN_E" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt9VT2wfN_E</a><br>
the first part<br>
listen carefully and dont deny the truth. you didnt know about that sound.<br>
however, it doesnt matter since the second aprt of your post is true.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbYsoEasio" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbYsoEasio</a><br>
everybody has heard this wilhelm scream somewhere  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
btw the wilhelm scream is also in gow3  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>kinda stupid, this copy paste shit. i mean, it cant be that hard to record a scream and modify it so u can use it properly …</p>

            <p>It’s not the same sound. It’s hardly even similar.</p>
<p>Here’s actual citadel alert: <a href="https://cl.ly/3x322D25260O1u220B3Z" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cl.ly/3x322D25260O1u220B3Z</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe you thought of city siren sound? -&gt; <a href="https://cl.ly/2B1h3l2D3t0b021f2R3i" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cl.ly/2B1h3l2D3t0b021f2R3i</a></p>
<p>And by the way, get used to this. Even the biggest game companies and film studios use commonly known and ‘worn out’ samples. It’s kinda sad, taking into account the fact that sound designers and producers don’t cost much. I guess only the best directors and crews don’t let that happen, creating their own each time.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you recall, one of the most popular sample that is being used everywhere since a couple of years was also used by Valve in Counter Strike Source, when you hit any car model with a grenade. I can’t find it on web but if you played CSS you know what I mean.</p>
