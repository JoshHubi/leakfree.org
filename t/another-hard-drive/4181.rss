    <title>Another Hard Drive</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/another-hard-drive/4181</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m in need of a new hard drive, yet can&#39;t really decide on what to get.

I&#39;ve been told by a few people that the WD Caviar Black 640GB is good (That will be enough space for me), but for $5-10 more you can get the 750GB.

a) What would be the better choice (This drive will have all my Steam games on it, so the faster the better)
b) Are there any other worthwhile options of similar size and price (Around AUD$100)</description>

            <p>p5kpl-cm with a 430W psu that can only deliver 350W and the CPU is overclocked to 2.94Ghz.<br>

Don’t worry though, I spent exactly as much as I needed for my PC, I can even play GTA4 on high (no lag until it runs out of ram ~10min) so apart from ram I don’t need an upgrade until some part of this rig dies. If you want to see the most badass part of my PC, <a href="https://www.quietpc.com/files/images/products/ninja.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s311/sersoft2/PIC-0009.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. It keeps my CPU at 40C on full load.</p>
<p>post cout != anything</p>

            <p>My recommendations:</p>

<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136284" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">WD1001FALS</a> &lt;-- AUD$117.86 (1TB 7200 RPM 32MB Cache SATA 3.0Gb/s)<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136533" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">WD1002FAEX</a> &lt;-- AUD$129.64 (1TB 7200 RPM 64MB Cache SATA 6.0Gb/s)</p>
<p>I personally own the WD1001FALS, I’ve been using it as my main file storage drive.  It’s served me well so far, in the year and a half that I’ve owned it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wrong link on the first one, fixed. XP</p>

<p>I’m not sure about Cameron, but my Steam directory is something in the neighborhood of 20GB.  Even the smallest (~24GB ) SSD’s are at or over $100US.  Considering the loss of capacity due to memory addressing, and the ability to use the drive for more than just Steam, he would need at a least a 128GB SSD, which is pushing $300.</p>
<p>To be sure, they are fast, but I don’t think they fit his requirements.</p>

</aside>
<p>SSD’s are way too expensive, and you get like 50 - 100 Gb in return. Yes they are extremely fast, but I think most people would use the money to get a better CPU/GPU.</p>

<p>All the above advice is true.  Western Digital generally makes great drives (in 14 years of building PCs, I’ve only ever used WD and Maxtor, and [knock on wood] haven’t had a single drive failure).  And with magnetic 7200RPM drives, the cost per gigabyte is so cheap nowadays, as you noticed - you can add an extra 110GB for only $5-10.</p>
<p>I would warn against RAID0 unless you have a reliable and frequent backup system - even if the drives themselves don’t fail, RAID controllers, driver issues, etc. can all affect a RAID.  I’m not saying they don’t perform well (used to run two separate RAID0 arrays in my machines, they are fast) but the failure consequences are high.  RAID0+1 helps in this regard, but you’re only looking to get 1 drive so we can forget about that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Bottom line - definitely go with a WD, and then, definitely go for the Caviar Black with the highest cache available.  Whether you get Sata 3.0 or Sata 6.0 is up to you and your motherboard specs, but capacity is up to you  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Yeah it’s a major weakness of RAID 0. I would suggest only to use it if you’re going to work with a lot of big files (I don’t like waiting half an hour for a huge file to copy on my HDD).</p>

            <p>So I’m in need of a new hard drive, yet can’t really decide on what to get.</p>
<p>I’ve been told by a few people that the WD Caviar Black 640GB is good (That will be enough space for me), but for $5-10 more you can get the 750GB.</p>
<p>a) What would be the better choice (This drive will have all my Steam games on it, so the faster the better)<br>
b) Are there any other worthwhile options of similar size and price (Around AUD$100)</p>
