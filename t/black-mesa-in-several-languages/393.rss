    <description>Hello
Times I wanted to ask whether the mod in several languages will be translated. By this I mean not only by subtitles, but also the [u]sound[/u]?</description>

            <p>Haha, it’s just a joke me and my mates have, cause my housemate is French and he has designer clothes and scarfs from Europe. He has more clothes than his girlfriend, and he says it’s cause it’s like that in Europe, so we say he’s just using European as a fancy word for gay :3</p>

            <p>Sure you can! The translation thread is <a href="https://www.blackmesasource.com/forums/showthread.php?t=70" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.  Feel free to post there, although ViDaNor has been kinda MIA lately, so it probably would be better to sign up <a href="https://bmtranslate.forumsplace.com/index.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and start posting your translations. Feel free to ask questions over there.</p>

<p>Hey F*ck you! Europeans aren’t fags!<br>
Anyways, can I translate it into Romanian? It will sound like:</p>
<p>"Om de ştiinţă: “Îmi pare rău, Domnule Freeman, dar nu am putut risca să deschid acea uşă până când nu am fost sigur că aţi curăţat zona. Aceasta e ultima intrare în complexul Lambda. Toate celelalte au fost sigilate ca să ţină invazia înăuntru. Când am realizat că chiar aţi putea să ajungeţi aici, am tras la sorţi să vedem cine ar trebui să rămână în urmă să vă lase să treceţi. Bineînţeles, l-am tras pe cel mai scurt. Colegii mei aşteaptă la marginea reactorului Lambda. Aşteptându-vă, vreau să spun. Reactorul e oprit chiar acum, dar puteţi să-l activaţi pe drum. Va trebui să inundaţi centruş oricum ca să ajungeţi la laboratorul de teleportare. Nu sunteţ autorizaţi să ştiţi despre acelea, dar pot să văd că deja ştiţi mult mai multe decât ar trebui un om.”</p>

            <p>Seems pretty obvious that, on top of interpretation of voiceovers being subjective, the HL1 production did not enforce sound processing standards on the localization teams. It does not come as a surprise after reading the genesis of HL1 in “Raising the Bar”.</p>

<p>You really think that? I, for one, thought the French-speaking scientist sounded actually angry about the government’s idea of silencing the witnesses. At least it’s a lot better than the wimpy English-speaking scientist and his whining about the same issue.</p>
