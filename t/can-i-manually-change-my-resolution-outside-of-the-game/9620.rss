    <title>Can I manually change my resolution outside of the game?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/can-i-manually-change-my-resolution-outside-of-the-game/9620</link>
    <description>I installed the game and went to change the resolution to the highest I could for my monitor. Sadly I think I have set it too high now and the game will not launch at all. 

Anyone know of a settings.ini file or a way to launch game in a windowed mode?</description>

            <p>Just wanted to post and say I found a solution. Thanks to it being a source engine game, all of the source switches work so I was able to use;</p>
<p>-w 1028 -h 768</p>
<p>in the launch properties in steam to start the game at that low resolution.</p>

<p>Yes, there is actually a way to open the game in windowed mode.</p>
<p>With Steam open, in your library find the “Black Mesa” entry and right click, find properties and select that. There is a button labeled “SET LAUNCH OPTIONS…” where once you’ve clicked that, a small window with a text field will open. Type exactly the following:</p>
<p>-window</p>
<p>Click OK, and so forth. I’m not sure the resolution commands, but this will at least get you started in the right direction.</p>
<p>(Haha. I just realized, your first post on the forums is the question and my first post is the answer.) Enjoy the game! I know I am.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion, I tried it on both the shortcut on my desktop and the shortcut in steam. Sadly this didn’t work. I can see the window come up for a split second but it then disappears. Very frustrating.</p>
<p>I feel that there is a settings file stored somewhere during install since i have deleted all the content and reinstalled it.</p>
