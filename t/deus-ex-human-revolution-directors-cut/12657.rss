    <title>Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director&#39;s Cut</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut/12657</link>
    <description>If you don&#39;t already have Human Revolution, the [url=&#39;https://www.pcgamer.com/2013/10/11/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut-pricing-announced-is-cheaper-if-you-already-own-the-game/?utm_source=fb&amp;utm_medium=emp&#39;]Director&#39;s Cut release[/url] has all the DLC and lots of tweaks, such as revamped boss fights, at a $20US price point. If you already have the game, or the game and the DLC, the price gets adjusted accordingly. 

I personally cannot wait to see what they do with the boss fights. The boss fights were one of the few faults of the original game, so it&#39;ll be interesting to see what changes have been made.</description>

            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxnfPmd4itc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Video of Barrett’s boss fight.</a> Developer commentary is also on for this sequence, though it’s at the end of the video. The fight arena is doubled in size and honeycombed with extra rooms, vents, and terminals to hack.</p>
<p>EDIT: Bought the Director’s Cut myself and began a new game with commentary. It’s quite funny and informative.</p>

<p>Oh, not just boss tweaks:</p>
<p>“This director’s cut tweaks the boss fight, AI and graphics, adds a New Game+ option, developer commentary mode, and a making-of video.”</p>
<p>NG+ is rare in games these days but is making a bit of a comeback lately. The Last Of Us had it, which was a welcome addition. And, assuming the dev commentary is done well, that’s always interesting.</p>

</aside>
<p>A lot of the games I’ve played lately have had NG+.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m totally gonna buy this.</p>

            <p>i miss when games had free cheatcodes (DLC has corrupted this and so many other concepts), special unlocks after game’s beaten</p>
<p>there’s a reason GTA can have mods and still sell their DLC at a profit (Rockstar is known for doing DLC “right”)</p>

            <p>Hm… if you already have everything like me (I preordered and bought DLC, so I have anything besides the streamlined bossfights which should’ve been implemented into the game in the first place) I guess it’s not really worth the money… But highly recommended to anyone who doesn’t own any DX:HR Stuff</p>

            <p>If the boss battles are redone the same way as in the Missing Link then it’ll be worth the money.</p>
