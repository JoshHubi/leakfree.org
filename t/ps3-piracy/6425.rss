    <description>So as most of you know, it happened and now Sony is going to try and strike back.

Though it seems that they&#39;re going to be punishing their customers more than the pirates for some reason.

<p>Are you implying that microsoft has many any attempt to make sure their games are properly protected? Visit any torrent site and you’ll see that every game to this day is still easily torrented/burned/played in a modified xbox. Their are even revisions you can do to prevent being banned from online play.</p>

            <p>Not sure how familiar you all are with the hardware the systems run on and in the way the systems were compromised but in the wii’s case the system was beyond repair. The hacks completely broke the chain of trust by installing a new boot loader. Even if Nintendo wanted to do something they couldn’t. I view this very akin to what happened with the psp. Once CFW came out and made it very apparent to Sony that no matter what they come out with they will be able to hack it Sony backed off. They knew they had lost. (I also blame this on why they flipped when the ps3 finally cracked) The only thing that stopped homebrew and piracy on the psp was to release another hardware revision (and them another and another) That has built in hardware hash checking that would verify firmware packages. If you look at Nintendo (albeit a little different as Nintendo releases a new portable every 20 seconds) The 3ds now contains a kill switch that can kill your handheld. No security, no hash checks, just a switch that when Nintendo feels like it will turn off your system for forever because of a “Security” Breach.</p>

            <p>Couple of points I have to add in no particular order  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Companies that make a console make a loss on selling the actual hardware; they get a return from the price of games in the shops. This is why PC games are often cheaper, as no money goes back to a platform holder. So they’re not too keen on people buying their console then pirating all their games, or even buying pre-owned (like I do).</p>
<p>Some people have mentioned that the hackers should be entitled to do whatever they want with their consoles. While I have no problem with someone running some homebrew on their console, the hackers haven’t exactly made themselves popular, with stories emerging of them trapping people in CoD lobbies and wiping their XP. Might seem funny to a few of you, but not so funny to, say, a father of two who plays CoD for a couple of hours after work to unwind.</p>
<p>Piracy is a complicated matter; but I have zero sympathy for a hacker who makes themselves feel good for 10 minutes by ruining someone elses fun. That comes from a lack of social skills and the knowledge that the person who’s evening you’ve ruined can’t thump you</p>

            <p>I won’t lie, I pirate games all the time, but I get no multiplayer, and sometimes no patches, I buy multiplayer games that I like, ie Battlefield 2. I do buy ALL my steam games, I also bought Amnesia to support Frictional Games. I still chuckle a bit when I remember how the AC2 DRM servers went down and I, who never payed for the game, was playing offline, while people who did buy it couldn’t play at all.</p>

            <p>The case of iOS is pretty much identical because jailbreaking DOES potentially allow you to pirate apps and games on the appstore. Sure, most are worth less than a playstation game, but I think its safe to assume that a person won’t pirate just one app. I’m not saying that every jailbreaker pirates, all I’m saying is that the iOS jailbreaking and PS3 jailbreaking should be treated identically.</p>

            <p>Not too long ago, apple made a similiar case, asking the courts if jailbreaking iphones was illegal or not.</p>
<p>Courts didn’t see a problem with it.</p>
<p>Sure, one of the benefits of hacking a ps3 include free games, but i feel that if someone bougt their ps3 with their own money, they should be able to do whatever they want with it.<br>
Take android as an example. They’re soo liberal when it comes to 3rd party apps, and rooting phones. Have they complained about a loss in sales, or any kind of loss at all&gt; I don’t think so. Sooner or later, they’re going to be the big dogs, because they got their heads screwed in correctly</p>

<p>Me too. I guess the moral of the story is, make a really successful product so you don’t have to worry about any crap like this. Playstations are gonna go the way of the Dreamcast at this rate.</p>

            <p>Sony doesn’t even take the time to look at the big picture, the PS3 had decent homebrew capabilities from the very beginning with the “other OS” option, but still not able to play copied games. On the x360 for example, you can easily play copied games but still no way to run homebrew because the piracy route is just a hacked CD drive firmware.</p>

            <p>It seems like Sony has frightened and pissed off a lot of their legitimate customer base.</p>
<p>If I were them, I’d cut my losses and try to focus on just getting the online hacks under control to make the PS3 as enjoyable for legitimate customers as possible. Instead, they’re using scare tactics to try to bully people into not even looking up info on the crack and creating a lot of negative feelings towards them and the PS3. A lot of legitimate users are scared shitless of getting banned because the TOS keep changing.</p>
<p>They might be in their right to wage war like this, but I can’t see it doing anything but backfiring. Sony is on the fast track to video game irrelevance if they keep it up.</p>

            <p>Without a doubt, Sony really went the wrong way in this case by letting their customers take it up the ass, in a not very gentle way. I can understand that they fear piracy because this is what ruined PSP, a system that had a great potential that never really had a chance.</p>
<p>What Sony they really did wrong was when they removed Other OS, this is what many of the more known hackers said was the final drop.</p>
<p>Instead of suing hackers they should listen to their wishes for what they want from what indeed is a great system. Most of them have no interest in piracy being developers themselves.</p>
<p>Why the hell is it so hard for them to say “Sorry fellas, we were wrong! All lawsuits are dropped. Here, have Other OS back! Anything else you guys want?”</p>
<p>Don’t really see that piracy is a big issue anyway. 50 gig downloads isn’t cool unless you’re a douche.</p>
