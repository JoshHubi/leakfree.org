    <title>BMRF Emergency Broadcast on YouTube?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bmrf-emergency-broadcast-on-youtube/13783</link>
    <description>So, I made this video to get people ready and pumped up for the big release tomorrow. All I pretty much did is match the site in video editing (the Broadcast, sound, Bad TV effect) and I put links to the site and stuff in the description. Also, the video isn&#39;t monetized. I was wondering if I could keep this up and if others wanted to they could spread it around? All I want is to support the AWESOME mod and it&#39;s team   :smiley:  .

Here is the video:

I hope this is pleasing to all!</description>
