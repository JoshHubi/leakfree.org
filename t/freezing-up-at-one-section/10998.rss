    <title>Freezing up at one section...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/freezing-up-at-one-section/10998</link>
    <description>Ok so this is in the canyon where I first run into a tank. I&#39;m getting tons of stuttering and lockup issues here. It totally froze up my computer only moments ago for the first time. The most recent MDMP file is attached BUT this was from a couple of days ago so I doubt it&#39;s relevant. It didn&#39;t record one for the total system crash. Just figured I&#39;d take it on in case.
