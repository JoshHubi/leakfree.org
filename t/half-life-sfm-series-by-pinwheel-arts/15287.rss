    <description>Hey everyone, i just found about this gem of a channel.
One guy is making SFM movies within the Black Mesa, following the games story with amazing details and animation. Plus some new touches.

1st episode: [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnX3JwNoNgA&#39;]Half-Life: Anomalous Materials [SFM][/url]

2nd episode: [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0LUHKuU1gQ&#39;]Half-Life: Unforeseen Consequences Part One [SFM][/url]

I think the animations is smooth, though a bit unfinished and rushed.
But the story and added details are great!</description>

            <p>Watched the first episode with a smile on my face. Great little details as well, like Gordon fist bumping Eli. Great stuff!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
