    <title>Fatal crash - seemingly at random.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fatal-crash-seemingly-at-random/9824</link>
    <description>Hi all!

I&#39;ve just gotten the game, and I&#39;m really looking forward to reliving some old memories through it. Unfortunately, the game kills my computer.

First time around, the game crashed during the first loading, after the initial tram ride. You know, after you go into that huge vault door thingie. It starts with the sound going choppy, like any other crash. However, after a second or two the screen goes black, and loses input all together. I can&#39;t CTRL-ALT-DELETE, or do anything else for that matter. I have to shut down, and start over again.

It&#39;s happened two more times. One in the second part of the tram ride, and one after getting into the labs, but before the resonance cascade failure.

I&#39;ve updated all my GPU drivers, but nothing has changed. I&#39;ve attached my DXDIAG file.

Thanks  :slight_smile: 

EDIT:
Dxdiag - [url]https://pastebay.net/1074186[/url]
Also, no minidump files are generated after the crash</description>

            <p>i only registered here to say i fixed the random crash, and the library problems, and to share it with others.</p>
<p>so, i’ve downloaded over 20GB before i got this to work. first i got this official 3,07GB torrent and had some library problems. later i got non-steam version (almost 3,5GB ) and got the crashes after 1-2minute (sometimes in menu, sometimes in tram-depends where i was at the moment). after all these tries i saw i need the SDK Base thing. so i got torrent where there was SDK integrated in installation of BMS. that didn’t help either. after everything, i’ve downloaded 1st torrent (the one with 3,07GB ) and installed it over steam (SteamApps\sourcemods) and tried to download the SDK thing. since it was another long download and i had it downloaded in some non-steam BMS, i searched where it should be downloaded with steam and copied those files from offline installer of SDK to that folder (SteamApps). when i started steam again, i had SDK 2006 and 2007 installed. the BM was in list of games, and the tram scene went ok. i was very nervous if crash will happen agan - but the game kept runing  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  had no crashes at all after that… also, i saw people have bug with the gigantic fan and had some fixes for it too, but nothing happened when i turned the fan on  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  so, i guess installed steam, SDK 2006 &amp; SDK 2007 is needed to run the game without bugs.</p>
<p>cheers, i hope you get it fixed too…</p>

I’ll definately check these out! A computer-wizard friend of mine mentioned that there might be some “adresses” or paths or something that could be fucked up. We’re going to try and switch GPU’s and see if that does anything  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>No problems,</p>
<p>I only mentioned that it sounded like a gfx overheating problem because I had a similar affair with bf3, and it was a gfx overheating issue (nVidia does some funny shite when controlling the gfx fans).</p>
<p>Also, if it’s crashing to boot, rather than crashing to desktop, I would have assumed hardware error over software, as Windows should catch all software errors, and if it doesn’t, it should blue screen.</p>

<p>Why the f you have 12GB of RAM? Lol. It’s just a smidge pointless, but, whatever floats your boat  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I highly doubt that it’s overheating. I mean, this is Source we’re talking about. My GPU can handle higher load games without any problems. Besides, the error is identical to one I had in Civilization 5, which only occured when in singleplayer games. Thanks for your reply though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Is your computer a laptop? I had that very same problem with my previous laptop. Games freezing with sound looping, and then blue screen. At first, it only happened with powerful games, but in the end I even had crashes with Windows card games. It was a hardware problem. The GPU soldering was bad. Since it was included in the mobo, I had to buy a new laptop.</p>
<p>You should stress/test your GPU to make sure you don’t have that kind of hardware problem.</p>

<p>I have a similar issue. A random crash where my gpu crashes/monitors loose signal, with looping/stuttering sound.</p>
<p>Tried altering a few seconds, updating drivers, removing AVG and Spybot S&amp;D and several other common fixes. I used to have the same problem with L4D and I could not fix it. On two different systems. On the first after some time my GPU died and I got a new one. Problem still persisted. This GPU is in my new system. :’( No memory dumps either.</p>

<p>Sounds just like mine. I’ve experienced crashes like these in Civ 5 after the new expansion as well. Freakin weird!</p>

            <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I’ve just gotten the game, and I’m really looking forward to reliving some old memories through it. Unfortunately, the game kills my computer.</p>
<p>First time around, the game crashed during the first loading, after the initial tram ride. You know, after you go into that huge vault door thingie. It starts with the sound going choppy, like any other crash. However, after a second or two the screen goes black, and loses input all together. I can’t CTRL-ALT-DELETE, or do anything else for that matter. I have to shut down, and start over again.</p>
<p>It’s happened two more times. One in the second part of the tram ride, and one after getting into the labs, but before the resonance cascade failure.</p>
<p>I’ve updated all my GPU drivers, but nothing has changed. I’ve attached my DXDIAG file.</p>
<p>Thanks  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Dxdiag - <a href="https://pastebay.net/1074186" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pastebay.net/1074186</a><br>
Also, no minidump files are generated after the crash</p>
