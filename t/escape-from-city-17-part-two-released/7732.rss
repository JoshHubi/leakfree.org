I was surprised to see this finally coming out. Really high-quality fanfilm, and everything really looks like it&#39;s from HL2 Universe.</description>

            <p>I thought it was pretty good, myself. Sure, the romance elements were rather tried-and-true archetypes of these sorts of stories, but thankfully it was relatively unobtrusive. The effects work was phenomenal, but considering the standard set by Part One, it had to be.</p>

            <p>I am glad it’s finally released, but i feel like the first one was better in every way.the post-process effects seemed weak, and the colors were lacking saturation. The first one had a much more “crisp” feel to it, and having a shallow story actually helped it’s case.</p>
<p>This short film is supposed to be a demonstration of their CG skills, so having badass action scenes without a story is the perfect way to show it off.</p>
<p>Just my two cents…</p>
<p>But still, it’s very imaginative and true to the Half - Life universe. Not bad.</p>

<p>1st of all: Who says they fucked? I only saw them kiss.</p>
<p>2nd: Even if they did - never heard of post traumatic sex? It’s like almost every love story in every other action/adventure movie starts.</p>
<p>They first meet when he saves her life. The next scene with them talking in an abandoned building has evening-like lighting. So it’s the end of that same day at least. They decide to sleep. Next day they fight alongside the rebels, having to rely on each others abilities to survive. Next scene depicts her with a sniper rifle. Could be another day later, as it is not shown how they got that rifle. Also the lighting is different again and looks like early morning, coming straight through the window. They both share a moment when he comments on her sniper skills. Later the same day they defeat a strider together while working as a team.</p>
<p>I’d call that some extreme bonding experience. Also, they have saved each others asses how many times already? Plus, they have gone through great danger together for at least two or three days, probably more. Extreme situations like these are known to spark the urge to mate in human beings. Post traumatic sex.</p>

            <p>Nah, wasn’t taking it personally, I liked it a lot. I just thought the whole movie thing (common in Hollywood too) about a girl being in love just because they got saved was cheesy.</p>

<p>Hi there. We met, and we fought off a great danger together! SOMEHOW WE ARE IN LOVE!</p>

<p>The problem was time. First of all, in a short film, there simply is not enough real time to show enough scenes to develop a relationship between two characters, not unless you are a really masterful writer already. It’s interesting to note, however, Escape from City 17 worked a lot better because the characters already had a relationship. They didn’t set it up, they just presented the characters as being friends and we accepted it. It worked much better. Second, not enough time had passed <span class="bbcode-i">inside the movie world</span> for the relationship to be believable. The battle may have lasted for a week, but they are only shown to be together for a day, two days tops. Even if a deep romantic relationship COULD happen, it would feel much more realistic if the culmination of their experiences just made them respect each other. Some better actors would also help with believability.</p>
<p>Oh and don’t take criticism of this film so personally. I was just pointing out what could make it better in a perfect world, I’m not faulting them for not making it the best short film ever. They did an awesome job for a $250 budget + whatever they already owned, but if they DID have a better monetary/time budget, this is what I’d like to see done better.</p>

            <p>The headcrab scene really bothered me. It’s like that headcrab was de-beaked. (Lamarr lol) and sat there on top of that girls head for a minute and did not do anything. She should have died. Also Awkward that the bullet only killed the headcrab not the girl.</p>

            <p>I was looking forward to this second part, since the release of part one. It did not dissapoint. Very well done with lots of half-life 2 stuff for fans to recognize.</p>
<p>In nitpicking mode, I would prefer a shorter version of the sequence where the girl is being suffocated by the face-hugger. The story may not be exciting or original but it was decent enough and made sense, so that is a plus for any fan-made effort.</p>

            <p>This is the best HL-2 fan-film in my opinion. I like very much the horror scene at 11:29 where there are zombies inside the tunnel…very scary!</p>

            <p>Is it even possible to<br>

            <p>Maybe they should have WRITTEN A SCRIPT before they started filming <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>And if they did, well. They shouldn’t anymore.</p>
