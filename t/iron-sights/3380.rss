    <description>(Ehem some stupid monkey just locked my thread in the cafeteria section. Good community here I can tell.)

Why is it that there are still games without iron sights? I don&#39;t mean shitty games like TF2 since that is for kids anyways but I mean BM and L4D2 don&#39;t have iron sights. Why? Every game should have this awesome feature for reasons I already stated.</description>

<p>That monkey is a mini god to some of us here RealitySucksBadly coughacristoff2cough.  I would suggest you take a look at the faq thread, the ask a question thread, the make a suggestion thread and perhaps even the wiki before posting again.</p>
<p>Three strikes may take you <span class="bbcode-b">and </span>your ghost accounts out.</p>

            <p>Also, you called TF2 shitty but not L4D2.  What’s up with that?</p>
<p>L4D2 was a money grab, TF2 is a solid game that is constantly being worked on and updated.</p>

            <p>Ok Reality. You aren’t trolling as such other than your insult to rabid. In which case: troll.<br>
Otherwise this has already been discussed. The answer is no. No IronSights. Please use the Search Feature. If a thread is locked, don’t argue. It was locked for a reason.</p>
