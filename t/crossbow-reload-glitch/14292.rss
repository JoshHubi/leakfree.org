    <title>Crossbow Reload Glitch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crossbow-reload-glitch/14292</link>
    <description>I have experienced a sound glitch with the crossbow. It was present in the 2012 mod release as well, and it&#39;s still not fixed.

Basically the reload sounds don&#39;t sync. with the animations. (Simple as that).

It&#39;s a pretty minor glitch, but after you notice it, it becomes annoying. Didn&#39;t play the game since the latest patch, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still there, but in case it is, there ya go. Also I think the crossbow didn&#39;t have sprinting animations (the last time it didn&#39;t have anyway).</description>

            <p>The Crossbow has been completely redone and the updates to it will be rolled out in the next major patch. As it was in the process of being redone when we rolled out the early access release, we decided that updating its animations on the old model was not worth the effort, hence why it does not have sprinting animations.</p>
