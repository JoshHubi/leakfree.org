    <title>XCOM 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xcom-2/14130</link>
    <description>This teaser from 2K Games is a website for a medical and genetic therapy company trying to create a perfect world. Plasmids (Vigors in BioShock Infinite) are powers you can use that rewrite your genetic code. This &quot;Advent&quot; company could be making Plasmids. The cryptic tweets from 2K Games and the company&#39;s goal of a perfect world give me a feeling of an imperfect utopia, like Rapture from BioShock at its peak or Columbia from BioShock Infinite, an oppressive wonderland where no one questions anything. I&#39;m excited to see where this goes. I can&#39;t think of a single thing this could be other than a new BioShock, because I highly doubt they would create a new IP that has such a similar feel to BioShock. I&#39;ll be watching this closely. Also, scroll through the page and mouse over things. There&#39;s messages about Advent lying to us, millions of people having gone missing, etc. At the bottom there are testimonies from people who are happy living in these cities that Advent has built, almost like they are brainwashed and following along, like the citizens of Rapture and Columbia. The testimony for one person changed after some time, into a cryptic message, with a counter over his picture saying how long he had been missing. This may extend to the other people in the pictures. Holy shit, 2K. I can only get so hyped.

<p>Gameplay! Graphics aren’t bad but they could use some enhancing, which should happen pretty quickly with the mod support. Gameplay looks pretty good though. I like the destruction, at least the little bit that they showed of it. Not really a fan of all the cinematic camera angles that are always used but you could turn those off in EU so I imagine it will be the same here. I saw that it was a 25 minute video and was excited but the gameplay isn’t most of that unfortunately. Can’t wait for this game.</p>

<p>Mod support basically is the source code of the game and the tools the developers used to make the game. So between this and Cossacks 3 modders are going to have a lot of fun towards the end of this year.</p>

<p>Still 4-6 man squads and still the same movement and attack gameplay with 2-3 movement points. An inventory (though it seems you can’t use anything from the inventory an it’s just for loot), procedurally generated levels, more destruction (they give an example of acid eating through floors), and that you start off facing the human grunts of the aliens rather than the aliens themselves because they’re really powerful.</p>
<p>Also they said the models and textures from the trailer are the same as in game.</p>

            <p>yay! this looks really good!<br>
I really like XCom: Enemy Unkown and Enemy Within, but I didn’t play the old games, though (was busy beating Jagged Alliance 2 like 20 times).<br>
Seems to be an interesting setting, too. Either the aliens have infiltrated the earth’s society long ago (“They live”- style) or they are no aliens at all but mutated humans?</p>

<p>Maybe. I’d be really disappointed if they are talking about gene splicing and this seemingly perfect utopia just to make a new XCOM game. XCOM: EU was great, but this feels much more like BioShock to me.</p>

<p>Well, System Shock 2’s Von Braun was, in essence, a city.  It’s a more condensed form of Rapture.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>What I’m saying is that as far as the BioShock franchise is concerned, the retrofuturistic elements are part of what makes it special to me.  It’s a past generation’s vision of the future that never happened.  Same as Fallout.  I love stuff like that.  So, if you wanted to set a fourth BioShock game in the future, I’d feel it was missing out on that.  If you called it something else, then I’d go in with a different mindset.</p>
<p>In fact, I still maintain that I’d have a more positive opinion of BioShock Infinite if it was called AeroShock or something like that, instead of trying to clumsily retcon itself into Rapture’s narrative.</p>

<p>I understand that. I adore the whole retrofuturistic thing.</p>

I’d also say that a great deal of what I find attractive about the BioShock franchise is its retrofuturism and the way that, like Fallout, it juxtaposed the stereotypical values of 1950s society against a bleak reality.  Infinite already had less of that compared to the original, being set in the less memorable period of the 1910s, and if this takes place in the future… well… what makes this different from something like Deus Ex?</p>
<p>I do welcome the possibility that we’re back to the city-as-a-character archetype, though.</p>

<p>Well, the BioShock games are a spiritual successor to System Shock, a cyberpunk series. Granted, those took place on space stations, not in cities. I think if whoever makes the next BioShock (maybe 2K Marin) does it right, we’re looking at a potential System Shock 3, but with a city containing real personality.</p>

<p>I love ideas like that. A noble goal with a shitty ending.</p>

            <p>This teaser from 2K Games is a website for a medical and genetic therapy company trying to create a perfect world. Plasmids (Vigors in BioShock Infinite) are powers you can use that rewrite your genetic code. This “Advent” company could be making Plasmids. The cryptic tweets from 2K Games and the company’s goal of a perfect world give me a feeling of an imperfect utopia, like Rapture from BioShock at its peak or Columbia from BioShock Infinite, an oppressive wonderland where no one questions anything. I’m excited to see where this goes. I can’t think of a single thing this could be other than a new BioShock, because I highly doubt they would create a new IP that has such a similar feel to BioShock. I’ll be watching this closely. Also, scroll through the page and mouse over things. There’s messages about Advent lying to us, millions of people having gone missing, etc. At the bottom there are testimonies from people who are happy living in these cities that Advent has built, almost like they are brainwashed and following along, like the citizens of Rapture and Columbia. The testimony for one person changed after some time, into a cryptic message, with a counter over his picture saying how long he had been missing. This may extend to the other people in the pictures. Holy shit, 2K. I can only get so hyped.</p>
