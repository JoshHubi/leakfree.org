    <title>Path of Exile Open Beta</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/path-of-exile-open-beta/12023</link>
    <description>The developer staff on this indie title is going to make their game available in 20 hours or so: [url]https://www.pathofexile.com/[/url]

I&#39;ve been looking for something to replace the hole in my life that was Diablo II for me, this looks to be exactly what I&#39;m looking for. It&#39;s completely free, why not give it a whirl when it&#39;s released to the public?</description>

            <p>Question guys, dunno if it’s a development overlook or I’m missing something… but let’s say there’s a “cleave skill” gem and it’s to be used with weapons, but why can I socket it into armor as well? Can I use it that way? If not, shouldn’t it give some other bonuses as in D2 when the bonus was dependent on the given equipment piece? If neither that, then it’s pointless.</p>

            <p>The normal attacks feel kinda weak but I love the effects of the skillgems.</p>
<p>It certainly isn’t nearly up to the quality of Diablo 1 or 2, but Diablo 3 was painfully stupid so it’s nice to have an alternative to the butchering of the franchise</p>

<p>Their servers are overloaded. I expected this from them considering it’s a small time indie title.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/dotard">@dotard</a>, if it’s not your game, it’s not your game.</p>
<p>Honestly, I like the game and its concepts that’re added in. But I agree with ya, it’s no D2. But I’ll take what I can get.</p>
<p>I’ll be sure to rebuild my summoner on there with the highest breakpoints possible so I can pvp. Now if they had a fucking teleport skill…</p>

<p>Not really… I still like D2&amp;D3 better, I know it’s just a beta, but something tells me that the term “gameplay balance” is unknown to them. Also I’m not fan of their passive/talent tree idea, neither of skill gemming and no gold ._.</p>

            <p>I played the weekend public beta test way back with a couple of friends, and we enjoyed it so much that we shelled out $15 each for closed beta access.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this game, I haven’t played an RPG that much since the first Diablo.</p>
