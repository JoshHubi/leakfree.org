    <title>New Animations for Zombies</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-animations-for-zombies/4486</link>
    <description>Probably I&#39;m much too late with my demand / suggestion. 

But if there was one thing which I really loved in Half-Life 1 compared to Half-Life 2 was the more creepy appearence of the zombies. 

In Half-Life 2 the Zombies just looked clumsy. Headcrabs just appeared oversized and the tottering style of movement in combination with the 
moaning rather made them looks like some drunk fools walking down the street. They appear so vulnerable that I sometimes even felt sorry for killing them. 

On the other hand the Zombies in Half-Life 1 had something more threatening. They didn&#39;t appear like some sort human lifeform anymore, but more like something more gross, somehow letting you feel as player that these bodies aren&#39;t in control of humans anymore. Their stiff and upright style of walking was just more creepy and they appeared much. Especially when you were trapped on a narrow catwalk and these things kept on walking straight into your direction. While you were firing your Berreta and started to run out of bullets, preparing yourself for close combat with the crowbar.</description>

            <p>I agree that the zombies were scarier in the first Half Life, but I think the animations should be a moderate mix of the HL and HL2 anims. Much like what they have now.</p>

<p>I disagree with you on that. They may be natural evolution, but there wouldn’t really be much point in evolving those forms past a few scattered caves or deep-woods ponds where the exact conditions that would require those conditions were met. If the Combine had developed them, however, it would explain why they were not only in the headcrab rockets along with the normal headcrabs in HL2’s Ravenholm–and in such a large supply without a Gonarch present–but also why poison/fast zombies appear in larger quantities in Combine-heavy areas.</p>

<p>I’ll do that if i will not like them. I hope there will be less content from HL2. I am glad that sound are remade and aminations too as i see on screenshots… I don’t want to hear human voice calling for help.</p>

<p>How the f would anyone survive with big mouth with sharp teeth in your body??? Host is absolutely dead and headcrab zombie should only be a headcrab with human body. You all want to see l4d style zombies- screaming and running. HL1 zombie is a headcrab controlled human body, not human.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>that’s why I preffear the fast zombie in hl2, they seem to be a complete dead body controlled only by the headcrab, nothing about feeling pain and all that crap that the normal one have, just a headcrab with a body.

<p>Because the Headcrab is acting like Life Support, it’s keeping the brain alive even though the rest of the vital organs have mostly shut down. Normal Headcrab Zombies are still aware of what’s going on, but all they can do is yell and scream in pain and terror as they have no control over their limbs.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That is 1 of the things I don’t like, hear reversed sounds of pain in the host, what I liked of hl1 is that they didn’t do that and they had their own alien sounds not human reversed ones like GET IT OFF ME, GET IT OFF! &lt;-a reversed sound of a normal zombie pain.</p>

</aside>
<p>They just ported all to source engine. Thanks to BMS well see a real remake of HL1. Anyways well see everything after release. There are so many opinions. Everyone wants something different. If something will be really annoying me, I’ll change that.</p>

<p>Headcrab is not keeping brain alive it is controlling the body. Don’t look on hl2. hl2 killed the old feel of the game. And you know why? Only because valve could do it. I want to see less hl2 stuff in BMS. Only headcrab can stay from hl2 and some other stuff that did not chance but only got better. I don’t want to see something changed only because it will look more realistic. I want to see hl1 pushed to a new level.</p>

            <p>The only sad thing about the zombies , considering how gruesome the death of the victim is, is how comical they can be (especially in half life 2) in many ways, but its all part of the experience aswell.</p>

<p>How the f would anyone survive with big mouth with sharp teeth in your body??? Host is absolutely dead and headcrab zombie should only be a headcrab with human body. You all want to see l4d style zombies- screaming and running. HL1 zombie is a headcrab controlled human body, not human.</p>
