    <title>Captions and Subtitles does not work for Simplified Chinese</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/captions-and-subtitles-does-not-work-for-simplified-chinese/9569</link>
    <description>Actually I cannot tell if this is an issue or rather a help request...
Posted it on BM International but I suppose maybe I should post it here to technically solve the problem?

I set my Steam language to Simplified Chinese, re-named my WIP txt files into bms_schinese.txt and closecaption_schinese.txt, then entered the game...
At first in the menu the UI seems fine. However, when in-game, the subtitles doesn&#39;t show up. And the only stuff that works is corrupted as follows:

I&#39;m pretty sure that I saved the file in UCS-2 Little Endian format, the same as used in hl2_schinese.txt and its closed caption.
So, is this an issue? If not, any idea how to make BM work with Chinese characters? 

Thanks in advance  :wink:</description>
