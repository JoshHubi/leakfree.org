            <p>I’d say Fallout, you could carry hundreds of weapons at once if you didn’t have any other items on you.</p>

            <p>I’m going to go with the original Goldeneye, especially with the all guns cheat.<br>
Carry every weapon in the game. Including a tank turret. Not to mention doubles of most of them for dual wielding. Plus carrying extras of the PPK and Mp5k with suppressors on them rather than detaching the suppressors.<br>
EDIT: Just did a quick count of all the weapons in the game. Including a second for weapons that can dual wield, there are a total of 52 weapons in the game, all of which can be carried at once. 53 if you count the plastic explosives in the Silo level.</p>

            <p>Metal Gear Solid 3 / 4 - Snake already carries a lot in just a few weapons slots (RPGs, assault rifles) but if you count the pause screen, he can carry dozens and dozens more - he just has to “equip” them for the moment. In 3, he also carries numerous spare camoflauge uniforms and all kinds of other items.</p>

            <p>Some early games probably capped items based on the register width or some such, so you could theoretically carry 255 or 65535 weapons in a game like that. I don’t actually know of any for sure.</p>
