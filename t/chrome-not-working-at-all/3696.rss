    <title>Chrome not working at all</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/chrome-not-working-at-all/3696</link>
    <description>Okay, so my chrome stopped working. Out of the blue, just while browsing these forums. I can&#39;t even load a single page (using firefox right now) without chrome telling me that it has frozen. For example, I open chrome, and wait for the homepage to load. I stare at a blank screen for a moment or two, then I get this:

[img]https://img180.imageshack.us/img180/3398/chromeshit.png[/img]

I click &quot;Kill pages&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t do a thing, as the page still tries to load.

And you know that speed-dial screen (or whatever the hell it&#39;s called) that shows up when you open a new tab? Well that doesn&#39;t work. It just shows a blank screen.

I&#39;ve also tried Iron, but that doesn&#39;t work either, which I think means that it&#39;s a problem with the whole Chromium software thing.


So, yeah, if you have any suggestions, or this happened to you before, post it here please.</description>

<p>This happened to me, I fixed it by opening task manager and quitting chrome under the processes tab.  Hope it helps.</p>

<p>Well yeah, it shuts down chrome, but it still isn’t working when I open it again.<br>
And yes, I did try rebooting my computer.</p>
