    <description>We touched on this in the Ask a Homosexual thread, I think it&#39;s an interesting topic that deserves its own thread so we don&#39;t hijack that thread.

So, what are your views on the subject?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>If my history is correct, marriage originally was a contract between a man and a father who wanted to get rid of his daughter. The man would buy the daughter from him. Sometimes arrangements between families were made where the fathers of two families agreed to marry their children to one another in order to create a bond beneficial to both of them. Especially wealthy and politically interested families did so.<br>
Marriage condemned the girl to be obedient and sexually submissive towards her husband, while the husband would grant her a roof over her head, a regular income or at least something to eat every day and protection from other men. The man, however, was not obliged to stay true (sexually) to his wife. In later times (Renaissance comes to mind) both husband and wife (at least in wealthy families) were allowed to have sex outside of marriage. Even love was allowed, as long as the marriage was not damaged.</p>
<p>Marriage is also an agreement to start a family together and bring up kids in a secure environment with two parents, the mother being the one who cares about them most of the time, and the father being the one who plays the authority figure in questions of serious punishment.</p>
<p>Then came all the theatre plays and love novels from the Elizabethan age up till the 19th century, and more and more marriages were made out of love instead of mutual benefit. As biology shows, the time of being “infatuated” can last as long as 2-3 years, then the production of the necessary hormones or whatever comes to a halt, and either serotonine or dopamine take over, if the relationship still has rewarding experiences to offer at all.</p>
<p>So a lot of love marriages ended badly. And still do so today. Because marriage was ever intended for love. To be continued…</p>

            <p>Aside from government recognition and all that, I don’t think marriage actually <span class="bbcode-i">means</span> anything. A couple could seem just like they were married even if that’s the last thing they EVER want to do.</p>

</aside>
<p>You <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> do that without marriage.  Marriage simply codifies it.  In religious marriage, you go before God (or whatever deity you happen to worship) to codify it.  In legal marriage, you go before the government and get a contract which entitles you to certain privileges, rights and responsibilities as recognized by the government.</p>
<p>There is no need to get married to spend your life together with the person you love and respect.</p>

            <p>To me, marriage was a religious thing at one time…in some arenas.  Marriage is not, itself, is not a religious thing, however.  It can be religious, but it doesn’t have to be.  It can be purely secular.</p>

<p>…I’ve always viewed marriage as a religious thing. If I ever do get married, it will be in a registry office with as little acknowledgement to religion as humanly possible.</p>
<p>If there was something similar (say, a civil partnership) I would actually prefer that. As a straight woman, I would genuinely prefer that, as little association with the religious element as possible.<br>

<p>Personally, I’ve never viewed ‘Marriage’ as religious. Certain ceremonies, yes, but not the <span class="bbcode-i">word</span>. The word ‘Marriage’ to me (between couples) simply means a loving declaration of spending your life together. So, with that in mind, I found ‘Civil Partnership’ to sound more like a business proposition than the ’ loving declaration of spending your life together’ I see the word ‘Marriage’ to represent.</p>

<p>Funny that, marriage always makes me think of a contract rather than of love.<br>
I’m always constantly reminded that it was once pretty much the act of a man BUYING a woman from her father. Thus, rather meaningless in my head.</p>

<p>And no, I do not intend for this to be a religion vs atheism thread, although I’d be stupid to think that that isn’t a factor in this topic.
