    <title>Rocket Launcher&#39;s laser is always in center of the crosshair</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rocket-launchers-laser-is-always-in-center-of-the-crosshair/15151</link>
    <description>While replaying black mesa (steam) again, I noticed a funny mistake. You see, the laser of rocket launcher is coming from, the rocket launcher. At least I think it does. And when, player is running, he is pointing it in totaly diffirent direction, and the laser is still pointed into the center of the crosshair. I know it&#39;s not a bug, more like a little oversight, but when I saw it, my life was not the same anymore. Please fix it if it&#39;s possible.

And sorry if somebody else already reported that issue. I didn&#39;t find any simmilar thread.</description>

            <p>Three levels of aim:</p>
<ol>
<li>no scope, laser is all over the place.</li>
<li>sturdy, little/no zoom, max run speed slows, laser is 95% stable.</li>
<li>regular aim.</li>
</ol>
<p>But the loss of a little realism simplifies it and takes out a good few days of dev time for an engineer that they can spend on Xen level productivity or bug fixes.</p>

            <p>not necessairly.  Keep in mind that player stops sprinting after shooting, so unless somebody is some kind of maniac who starts to sprint after shooting a rocket, it won’t be that harmful.</p>
<p>Another solution might be just deleting the running animation from rocket launcher.</p>

            <p>If they fixed it, aiming with the guided laser would be a bitch to do.</p>
