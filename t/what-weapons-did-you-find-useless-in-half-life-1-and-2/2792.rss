    <title>What weapons did you find useless in half life 1 and 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-weapons-did-you-find-useless-in-half-life-1-and-2/2792</link>
    <description>Personally for me, in half life 1 I found the pretty much all the grenades useless. For tripmines I never thought they were any use, grenades the npc&#39;s just ran away from them, and the satchels I used once and it was on the tank. 

For half life 2 I think it was the Crossbow thing. The superheated bars of rebar were slow, and even though the gravity was easy to factor in when making a shot. It was still a pain.

So what were yours? 

Also hello, I&#39;ve been paroosing the forums for about a year now, and decided it was time to register.</description>

            <p>For me, I wouldnt say that any of the weapons were useless to me. The problem I’ve always had is being too conservative of my powerful weapons (grenades, gluon, rpg, tau, etc.) I would always use things like the shotgun, mp5, smg, pistol, or even the crowbar if possible. Also in HL2 my “default” weapon that I always had out was the gravity gun.</p>

            <p>HL1: The secondary function of the pistol was pretty smiliar to the primary one of the mp5. The mp5 had a bigger magazine, so it made the pistol’s secondary fire function useless.<br>
The camera bombs were only useful for killing black ops/gargantuas who would run around the map alot. You were never really pursued by anything else.</p>

<p>The grenades in half life 2 are fun as hell…the only thing you can throw that has realistic physics when rolling on the surface of the levels. Very fun to throw in tight spaces and watch combine fly, period. And, I agree that it was more fun breaking shit with the crowbar and slashing your way through, but I don’t hate the crossbow, it really did have its uses.</p>

            <p>None of the weapons were really useless IMHO but there were ones I didn’t like. Grenades in HL1 were pretty shitty because of the engine’s limitations. Also, satchel charges, I’ve always thought, are pretty hard to use in single-player games.</p>
<p>What I hated most though were the Crossbows in both games. I don’t know, just something about running around with gravity guns and missile launchers and futuristic submachineguns, and then you get this shitty homemade crossbow firing little metal rebar things, meh, it just seemed pretty pointless; I’d much rather have had an actual sniper rifle.</p>
<p>Also I was never a huge fan of the gravity gun. Of course it was incredibly useful (well duh, they designed the game so it would be!) but I always preferred hacking and slashing my way through shit rather than picking up couches and tables and launching them into the distance.</p>

            <p>I find the HL2 Magnum useless. For some reason I can’t hit shit with it. I have no trouble doing 3 rapid headshots with the Glock but the .357 is completely useless on moving targets for me.<br>
Also the crowbar became rather redundant after obtaining the Gravity gun.</p>
<p>In HL the granades were useless against HECU, they would manage to run away even from cooked 'nades.<br>
Oh, and I almost never used snarks, mostly because there were more than enough other weapons with a smaller chance of backfiring.</p>

            <p>I never hated any weapons, I mean blah-blah-blah good to mix up for a challenge</p>
<p>I do think that the crossbow is very under appreciated, for it being your sniping ability (unless you try to quick zoom) it’s a damn good weapon, you just never get enough ammo to make good use of it</p>

<p>What?! that was awsome it owned all and actually was so easy to use, it did make sense because like it says it got overcharged and reverses the disintergrater giving it power isnstead.</p>
<p>I speant the entire last part of the game with this gun because its so easy its also hillarious picking up the enemies with it and chucking bodies to make more dead bodies lol and ripping parts of the wall to chuck too.</p>
<p>The fact that its the last part of the game, it was there on purpose so you could have fun at the end and made it more ‘epic’ as theres no need for the other weapons.</p>
<p>EDIT: it was also vital for the puzzles for reaching those long distances in the citadel which the normal gravity gun couldnt handle and so had a big use or you wouldnt ahve been able to complete the game</p>

<p>GTFO. The grav gun was the most satisfying weapon to use, esp. in ravenholm.&gt; <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Not to mention the most useful. HL2 would loose 40ish% of it’s game play if the grav gun wasn’t in it. Mainly because the small puzzles would suck.</p>

            <p>Most of the funky weapons found near the end of Half-Life 1. They seemed good and saved me a few times but I never really learned how to properly use them. I just got them so late in the game where all I was interested in doing was finishing so I never took the time!</p>
<p>The first time through I rarely used grenades in Half Life 2 but I’m no longer like that at all.</p>

            <p>For those of you that found the hivehand useless, GTFO.  It was one of my favorite weapons.  I liked standing behind a corner and firing those little buggers off around the corner.  “Chya chya chya chya, shruk, shruk, shruk, shruk, MEDIC!”  :3   Plus, you can launch them willy-nilly down a long corridor and they’d home in on the enemies in the area so you can know where they are before you encounter them.</p>
<p>There was a scene where the HECU were fighting vorts in a room with a tank.  I waited until the room was mostly cleared of both then just launched a bonanza of hornets into the room.  A few minutes later, the room was cleared and I lost absolutely no health.</p>
<p>The only weapon I had zero use for in any of the HL games was the blue-lasered tripmines.  They were more of a burden then a help to me.</p>

            <p>None of the weapons are absolutely useless, most serve as backups if you run out of ammo on your preferred weapon. They all have their individual uses, some are more useful than others.</p>
<p>The crowbar is your last backup weapon, you can’t classify it as useless. If you do then it means <span class="bbcode-i">you’re doing it wrong</span>. It consumes no ammo and is great for killing headcrabs and zombies, which in turn saves ammo. It should also be used to break crates and boxes to find more ammo. It’s fundamental to the game.</p>
<p>I found the Snarks, Grenades and Tripmines to be the least useful weapons in the game.</p>
<p>Snarks aren’t very reliable, and at the point in the game in which you get them, you’re already at a stage where you’re encountering the much harder enemies in the game like Agrunts and Soldiers very frequently, using Snarks leaves you quite vulnerable and defenseless, when you do attack with them you have to wait for the Snark(s) to reach the enemy and do their job whilst also preparing for the possibility of them turning around and coming back at you.</p>
<p>Grenades in HL1 do not handle intuitively like in HL2, so on the rare occasion where it’s appropriate to use (for indirect attack) them you’re likely to waste one or two using trial and error. That plus the fact that you can only carry a limited number makes them fairly useless</p>
<p>Tripmines are obviously very useless because there’s rarely an opportunity to use them, and if you do there’s no certainty (unless the enemy is part of a scripted event) that an enemy will set them off. You could plaster a corridor with them expecting a bunch of enemies to come charging down it and them not come. Generally they’re just more of a hindrance to you. In multiplayer they’re a treat though, easy kills.</p>

<p>All of you who don<code>t know how to play this still amazing game all weapons are good to use grenades to kill the ground turrets snipers and that guys who are in bunkers are killable with a grenade or RPG snarks eat baby headcrabs and its more easy in battle with gonarch crossbow is good to kill at the distance but also the tripmine is good to use when someone is following us a HECU or alien grunt or bullsquid the satchel charge is good to blow a couple of explosive crates or in battle with gonarch If you don</code>t know how to play don`t play anymore this is my point!</p>

<p>Ok, you know how to use all the weapons. Time to learn how to use commas.</p>

            <p>HL1: I never used the hivehand.</p>
<p>I actually used the tripmines a bit, like that part where a bullsquid spawns right behind you or the aslaves do later in the lambda complex… I just put a trippy there so when they arrive they go BOOM</p>
<p>BTW, using a tripmine on top of the tanks causes the game to crash :jizz:</p>
<p>How could you people not use the crossbow?! It was one of my favorite and most used weapons in HL… magnum ammo wasn’t all that scarce for most of HL1 anyway. I found myself using it quite a bit.</p>
<p>If there was ever a fight breaking out between tons of aliens and hgrunts, I would toss some snarks down there to spice things up  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
…and satchels… VERY effective on Black Ops if you’re in a corner and you plant one where they’re gonna pop out.</p>
<p>HL2: Bugbait after NP. The new grenades haven’t been so great either. I very rarely use the magnum because it’s realistic in that you can’t hold much ammo and it’s pretty scarce</p>
