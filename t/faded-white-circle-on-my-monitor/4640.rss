    <title>faded white circle on my monitor</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/faded-white-circle-on-my-monitor/4640</link>
    <description>Just today I noticed a 1 inch faded white circle on the lower left corner of my monitor. It is this spot where any pixels within it are whiter than they should be. If I look at my monitor from a different angle the spot turns darker, but the other parts of my monitor don&#39;t. I&#39;ve had my computer on for several hours today so I will turn off the monitor and let it cool down to see if that makes it go away, but if it doesn&#39;t, what might be wrong and can I fix it?


My monitor is an IH252 24 inch lcd.</description>

<p>Sig’d. Also, pics or it didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Anyway, the white dot hasn’t come back yet. I don’t think anybody has damaged my monitor and there isn’t any image that could have gotten burned into the screen, so I don’t know what the problem is. Next time it happens I will take a screenshot and see if the dot shows up in it just in case the problem isn’t the monitor.</p>

<p>Nah, just kidding. It sounds like something you’d get from burn-in.</p>

<p>Burn in on an LCD? Not possible.</p>
<p>However you can get an image persistance but this doesn’t really sound like the case. It’s probably a problem with the onboard video controller … perhaps it overheats and malfunctions. Are there any OSD graphics that display a white circle in the lower corner?</p>

            <p>And the circle is back again, it seems to come on every time my monitor has been running for a while. I touched the back of my monitor and the part where the faded circle is coming from is actually cooler than the corresponding part of the monitor on the right side.</p>

<p>To me it sounds like you have some dying pixels on your hands, as you suggested I would recommend turning the monitor off for a time to cool it down, but if they are still there then you might have a problem.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

</aside>
<p>):</p>
<p>But don’t dying pixels happen randomly and not in clusters? And also, don’t they go completely white, not faded white?</p>
<p>EDIT: I let my monitor sit for a while and the dot went away!</p>
