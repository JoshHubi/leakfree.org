    <title>Some Music</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-music/1922</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been a fan of the half-life series a long time and have been watching Black Mesa Source grow and flourish into a most exciting mod. I&#39;m also a music producer and my style is very background-music esque, and was wondering if someone would give at least this one song that I, personally, found to be very half-lifey a listen.

It&#39;d be cool if I could get my music into this game, and since you guys probably already have your music done, I&#39;d understand that, but I also wanted some feedback on the song and reviews if you forum members could be bothered to do so  :slight_smile: 

It&#39;s not really a get up and fight song, more of a puzzle/alone piece. During those parts where you are alone without enemies for a while. It also loops nicely.</description>

            <p>Well, welcome to the forums.<br>
I suggest that you read the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=24" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">FAQ-Thread</a>. It has been stated there explicitly that you should direct applications toward the respective email adress listed in the thread and on the Jobs section of the BM website.</p>
<p>Also, the music is not exactly my cuppa tea. I like THAT it builds up with different layers, slowly growing on top of each other, but I don’t quite like how it all comes together. That droning at the beginning is also a bit too long for my tastes.</p>
