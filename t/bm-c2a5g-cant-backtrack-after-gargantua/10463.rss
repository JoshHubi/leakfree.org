    <title>bm_c2a5g Can&#39;t backtrack after Gargantua</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bm-c2a5g-cant-backtrack-after-gargantua/10463</link>
    <description>After I killed the Gargantua with the air strikes, I wanted to explore the tunnel I had to run like hell through (cool sequence btw, I felt like he was on my ass the whole way, with a car being pushed out the tunnel along side me). The tunnel doors appear to be open. They are bent with a large gap between them, but an invisible barrier prevents reentry.

Tunnel should either be blocked fully (lame... I notice a TON of that in BMS. Backtracking is prohibited almost everywhere) or the invisible barrier removed.</description>
