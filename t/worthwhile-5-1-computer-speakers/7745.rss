    <title>Worthwhile 5.1 Computer Speakers</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/worthwhile-5-1-computer-speakers/7745</link>
    <description>Hello all :-).

Simply put, I&#39;m trying to research and select a set of 5.1 speakers to replace my aging Creative P7800 set (which puts out ~70 Watts).  I&#39;m looking for a higher quality set (better sound reproduction, ~300+ Watts), and from what I&#39;ve seen, my options are pretty much the Logitech Z-series (such as 5500 or 906) or piecing together my own setup with receiver and such (which, while I&#39;m not against that, it would be something I&#39;m unfamiliar with).  

For right now, this would be primarily for PC use (gaming/music/movies), but if the set is robust enough I could see having it double for HTPC use.  I&#39;m currently using the Realtek soundcard on my P6X58D-E (all analog connections), though I also have an Asus Xonar DX (which I stopped using since it doesn&#39;t support surround sound in a few games like Stalker) which has analog and a TOSLINK.  

I can see spending ~$500 total for whatever route I go, and would prefer a system that does not have hardwired speaker connections.  Any recommendations?</description>

<p>This.  I just switched my speakers back to my Asus Xonar DX (as I haven’t played Stalker in a while) and man was my music missing something.  I’d forgotten how good some tunes can sound when played through the right hardware.</p>
<p>I consider myself a half-audiophile (or perhaps 25%) in that I can detect nuances in the audio field, need to have high bitrate (preferably lossless) music files, and played the trumpet in large ensembles for many years (middle/high school and community groups) thus acquiring a sensitive ear.</p>
<p>I think I’d consider the 906’s whenever I decide to get a new set (unless, of course, more companies pick up the ball on surround PC speakers and a better set comes out :-D).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Unfortunately I think the surround “era” has pretty much passed, mostly because “virtual surround” tech has gotten very good, so 5.1+ speaker sets sell less and less, which is provably why creative haven´t made a new set in forever, yet still manufacture the older ones, like the one I mentioned, the T7900, they´ve been around for like 6 years, and are still being made.</p>

<p>I´d have to disagree, I don´t consider myself an audiophile yet I can tell a huge difference between an onboard audio and a card, even if it´s the most basic Audigy 2 OEM card (like 20 bucks), still a huge difference. Of course it makes not much difference if you have a 2.1 speaker system for example, but if you have 4,5 or 7.1 speakers, massive difference.</p>

            <p>I just bought the Z5500 myself after a lot of research. and for PC speakers those do come out on top a lot. i also looked into more professional systems from company’s like bose, pioneer,… but to get a decent set of surround speakers you’ll pay double for what you get with something like the 5500 or the 906.</p>
<p>I had the option of the Z 906 and Z5500 myself. i got the 5500 because i liked the control pod display more than the leds of the 906. also if you like a lot of bass the 5500 has a bit more power for that. a lot of people say overpowering but you can turn it down anyway. the rest of comparison between the two sets is pretty much the same. the Z906 has one more input though.</p>

<p>I couldn’t disagree more. I have the 540s, they’re good, but by no means amazing. They have trouble hitting some high/mid-high frequencies, their response to mids isn’t great either. The rear speakers are way too quiet when using “matrix mode” - sometimes they sound a bit tinny, lacking bass on the satellites (yes, it has a sub, but a lil bass in the satellites wouldn’t hurt). The high end logitech 5.1s would be my way to go.</p>

<p>Wire them up to a decent sound card and use the sound cars option, not matrix. I have a Asus Xonar and i never use Matrix mode. On another note, I think its retarded when people say there’s no difference between onboard audio and and a good sound card.</p>

            <p>I have my computer hooked up to a hi-def 5.1 surround sound stereo that is not specifically made for computers. I have a 1/8" (headphone) jack out from my computer to an RCA connection in my stereo tuner. The entire thing was put together from miscellaneous parts. Tuner ($125), subwoofer ($150), speakers ($150), cables ($75).</p>
<p>The nice thing about it is I can put my laptop in my living room and have the entire room fill with sound. I feel it’s the best way to really get immersed in the game.</p>
<p>By the way, the sub has its own amp that puts out 2200 watts, and the speakers are total 2000 watts. Soooooo it makes noise.</p>
<p>[Edit:]<br>
It also saves a LOT of money if you have a hi-def TV with a DVI input in the back. That way, you can have a dedicated place for movies, TV, and gaming and you only need one monitor, one stereo, etc. I live on my own right now, so this is a possibility. If you live with a girlfriend/wife/parents/etc, this may not be the best option.</p>

            <p>Fair enough, I though that would be the case.</p>
<p>There are some nice suggestions here but with your realtek card I doubt you´d hear any difference, or any that´s worth the investment aniway.</p>
<p>You mention issues with the xonar on games, maybe invest in an x-fi? I´m yet to find compatibility issues with any games, same as before with my Audigy 2 (replaced it for 7.1 surround and windows 7 (the audigy series is just shite on windows 7), the x-fi also have digital outputs so maybe digital speakers?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the input, folks.  Luciel, the T7900 would be a VERY tiny step from the model I have, from what I can see in reviews they’re pretty much a rehash of my P7800s.  And Diabeetus, I agree, no batteries for me.  Eventually they’ll get there with wireless power which will ROCK for speakers, but for right now, cables it is.</p>
<p>Think I’ll do some more research, see if the Z906s are worth it or if I should put together a system.</p>

            <p>I have the Z906 and love them, though I could do without the wires.  I personally will put up with the wiring in exchange for not having to use batteries though.</p>

            <p>Hello all :-).</p>
<p>Simply put, I’m trying to research and select a set of 5.1 speakers to replace my aging Creative P7800 set (which puts out ~70 Watts).  I’m looking for a higher quality set (better sound reproduction, ~300+ Watts), and from what I’ve seen, my options are pretty much the Logitech Z-series (such as 5500 or 906) or piecing together my own setup with receiver and such (which, while I’m not against that, it would be something I’m unfamiliar with).</p>
<p>For right now, this would be primarily for PC use (gaming/music/movies), but if the set is robust enough I could see having it double for HTPC use.  I’m currently using the Realtek soundcard on my P6X58D-E (all analog connections), though I also have an Asus Xonar DX (which I stopped using since it doesn’t support surround sound in a few games like Stalker) which has analog and a TOSLINK.</p>
<p>I can see spending ~$500 total for whatever route I go, and would prefer a system that does not have hardwired speaker connections.  Any recommendations?</p>
