    <title>Game Crashing at On a Rail on Yellow Tram</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashing-at-on-a-rail-on-yellow-tram/14129</link>
    <description>Please help.  My game has been playing fine until I get on the yellow tram after launching the satellite.  It happens when I start the yellow tram.  As soon as it gets to the loading screen, the game just closes to my desktop.  I&#39;ve restarted my computer and it keeps happening.  Very frustrated right now as I see others have posted about this but I see no solution.   If anyone has any suggestion, please help!  I can&#39;t attach my crash file as I am sending this from a different device than the one I have my game on.</description>

            <p>Could you upload your save file too?</p>
<p>Open load game menu, find save, look at date and time, remember</p>
<p>Go to \steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bms\save ,</p>
<p>rightclick -&gt; view -&gt; details , sort by date  (date modified)</p>
<p>find two files which have that date.</p>
<p>7zip it on ultra preset, you should get “save.7z” file (or whatever you named it)</p>
<p>If it is smaller than 1MB, change file extension to .zip (file name should be “save.zip” or “save.7z.zip”, not “save.zip.7z”),<br>
add to post attachment.</p>
<p>If it is bigger than 1MB, upload is somewhere else and give a link.</p>

            <p>I’m having the same issue when it load On a Rail from apprehension. I’m going to try to brute force my way past it as you did. If or when I do i’ll report back how many attempts it took.   I’ve done the usual steam troubleshooting. Verify files restart steam and the computer. Everything is up to date with nothing unnecessary running in the background.</p>

            <p>I have this issue as well. I managed to get past it by repeatedly loading the nearest save before it and trying enough times that it would go through the loading screen.</p>
<p>I’ve attached a crash dump.</p>

            <p>Ok so I got past that point.  However, if I try and do any action prior to the tram crashing, the game crashes.  I can’t try and dismount the tram or shoot or else it crashes.  So I have to let my myself go into yet water.  Now I can play, however if I try and hit ESC to save, it crashes as soon as I hit ESC.  So I am using F6 to save for now.  I need to be able to get to the ESC screen to load and view option, though, so that isn’t good.  And I hope I can progress from the water put. So far I can’t but that could just be my poor gaming skills at the moment.  Anyway, help is appreciated very much.</p>
