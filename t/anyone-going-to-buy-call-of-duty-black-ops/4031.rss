Since CoD :MW 2 was a &#39;failure&#39;, will anyone be interested in buying CoD : BO when it comes out?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>BUMP!</p>
<p>Well, activsion continues to bend over players. With the new DLC released, ALL servers are running a playlist that includes the new maps. That means for people sane enough not to buy the map pack, every time a DLC map comes up, which is very very often, you will be kicked from the server. This means you are forced to server hop constantly just to keep playing. And another map pack is going to be released soon so that will make this problem even worse. It’s funny, I thought DLC was meant to be optional content.</p>
<p>As for glitches, they are still there just in different forms. My buddy complained to Activision because his prestige and unlocks kept getting reset in Black Ops. After several phone calls and e-mails as an apology he got an activation code that unlocks MW3 when it is released. I’m going to try bitching to Activision too and see if it works for me. If it works, we should all do it. You get a free game and fuck over Activision at the same time.</p>
<p>Wager matches, with only two worthwhile game modes, SAS and GUN, get old very quickly. More modes should have been included at launch or added in.<br>
Nothing more on mod tools yet. Supposedly we’ll be getting them this month. I’m starting to distrust that.</p>
<p>Spawns are incredibly irritating. On a lot of maps, in wager match, the spawns are all too close and you constantly get flanked by someone who just spawned next to you. On other maps, some spawns are too far spread out from the action so you end up walking for days to get any fighting in when someone else spawns right inside of the fighting. The flow in wager matches is awful too; in almost every map there is a small area or two or three small areas where ALL the fighting occurs, everywhere else is just there to annoy the hell out of you when you spawn in it. Chopping in half already badly made maps to make them small enough does not work well.</p>
<p>This game is a lemon that just keeps getting more sour.</p>

            <p>Maybe I’m dreaming but I like to think that Dice actually cares about BF’s quality. And I think we’re really not disagreeing as much as we think. CoD isn’t the bestseller, and it isn’t going to kill the fps market, but it’s definitely not helping. I’m just trying to say that a hell of a lot of those 60+ million copies could have gone to much more deserving developers.</p>

            <aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Work on your math.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My bad, the list actually didn’t include PC sales.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, you have to remember that the vast majority of COD sales have been made in only three or four years, whereas GTA and the rest of them have had at least 10 years and often more to gain that many sales.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Which explains why GTA has sold twice as many items.<br>
You’re missing the point.<br>
And I already gave an example of GTA IV selling 20+ million. Moreover, GTA sold over 70 million units since San Andreas (70%), which is ~ 6 years. Comparable enough, I’d say.<br>
What I’m getting at is that there always will be dominating companies on the market. A while ago it was EA. Microsoft, Rockstar and Blizzard had their moments. Now it’s Activision and IW. Tomorrow, it will be some other guys who got a lucky strike. But it would hardly bring any other franchise to bankrupcy.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The source cited for CoD’s “55 million copies” is from 2009.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hence why I estimated 60+</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>CoD is a huge chunk of the recent gaming market no matter how you look at it. Something selling that much is going to take A LOT away from other franchises. Think about it. If CoD weren’t around, think of how wildly popular BFBC2 would be (not that it isn’t already)? It’d be pretty much the only option. Sure there’s Homefront and a few others, but they’re pretty much just CoD without the blind fanbase.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sure it’s a bestseller, but it hardly can be considered a threat to the industry. There is too many factors.  It’s not the only multi-plat title that sold 20+ million.<br>
It is at the very least to early to consider. You have to acknowledge that the market is constantly fluctuating and people do change their preferences over the years. Call of Duty sales are already predicted to decline in 2011-onwards.<br>
And in five years, I bet 20 quid that there would be another mega-popular franchise that would sell 40 million a title.</p>
<p>And really, there’s no reason to blame CoD for ruining the FPS scene. If CoD weren’t around, there would be just another generic HQ series instead. As a hypothetic example, If there was no CoD, EA might as well wouldn’t work as hard on Battlefield 3 and new MoH. And everyone would bitch about it. And others would make clones of BF or MoH that people would bitch about too.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><span class="mention">@ODB</span> wii stuff is entirely irrelevant as it appeals to an entirely separate consumer base.  According to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">link</a>, CoD is tied for second out of best selling shooter franchises, second only to GTA. Both of it’s competitors have been around since the late '90s while CoD started in '03. The source cited for CoD’s “55 million copies” is from 2009. On top of that, that figure probably doesn’t include absurdly priced and obscenely popular DLC. Then there’s the fact that CoD takes forever to de-value, especially the latest two, so while many copies of Halo and Half-Life and GTA are selling at a quarter the original price, Black Ops and MW2 copies are still and will always be full price. And besides, huge sales are sales regardless of whether or not they top the charts.</p>
<p>CoD is a huge chunk of the recent gaming market no matter how you look at it. Something selling that much is going to take A LOT away from other franchises. Think about it. If CoD weren’t around, think of how wildly popular BFBC2 would be (not that it isn’t already)? It’d be pretty much the only option. Sure there’s Homefront and a few others, but they’re pretty much just CoD without the blind fanbase.</p>

<p>wat</p>
<p>Apnyway, I heard Killzone 3 got CoD treatment and therefore sucked compared to the second.</p>
<p>Infinity Ward / Treyarch works for a niche market. They haven’t done anything but MoH and CoD. Why would try their luck by losing their well-established jobs?</p>
<p>The only thing I feel sorry for is that there’s little hope for something like Xatrix/Gray Matter ever to emerge again.<br>
No more RTCW, Redneck Rampage, Kingpin.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I wasn’t talking about CoD devs making something not like CoD.  I don’t really care what Infinity Ward or Treyarch does.  I just hate when other devs do things like Call of Duty in order to attract call of duty fans.</p>

            <p>EDIT: Nvmd. Everything is accurate there.<br>
Combine sales for all consoles and you get the number.</p>
<p>Anyway, GTA IV did 20 million too.<br>
Franchise sold 100+ million copies versus CoD 60+.</p>
<p>Halo sold more than half of what COD sold with less titles and less install base.<br>
NFS sold… you get it.</p>

            <p>Check above. It hardly outruns titles like Halo, HL 1-2 and GTA. Usually every tile stops a 4-5kk, which is normal.<br>
Halo 3 figure of 8 million is much more impressive.</p>
<p>Nevermind Wii stuff.</p>
<p>Wii Sports (76.76 million)[70]<br>
Wii Sports Resort (27.68 million)[70]<br>
Wii Play (27.38 million)[71]<br>

<p>It’s fucking apeshit down there. Less than 5 million doesn’t even count.</p>

            <p>I don’t see your point. Sure it’s popular, but I don’t see other franchise sales dropping because of CoD. There always was smash hit titles - Halo, WoW, Sims, HL, HL2, Diablo, GTA 2-3-4. Why do you pick CoD as the only one?<br>
Besides, why would anyone care.</p>
<p>PC:</p>
<p>The Sims (16 million shipped)[1]<br>
The Sims 2 (13 million)[2]<br>
The Sims 2: Pets [expansion pack] (5.6 million)[3]<br>
The Sims 2: Seasons [expansion pack] (1 million)[3]<br>
World of Warcraft (12 million subscribers)[4]<br>
World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade [expansion pack] (at least 4.7 million; required to own Cataclysm)<br>
World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King [expansion pack] (at least 4.7 million; required to own Cataclysm)<br>
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm [expansion pack] (4.7 million)[5]<br>
StarCraft (11 million)[6]<br>
Half-Life (9.3 million,[7][8] may include PS2 version)<br>
Half-Life: Opposing Force [expansion pack] (1.1 million)[7][8]<br>
Half-Life 2 (6.5 million,[7][8] may include Xbox version but does not include Steam sales)<br>
Guild Wars (6.5 million in North America, Europe, and Asia; includes Factions, Nightfall, and Eye of the North)[9]<br>
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 (6.3 million in North America)[10]<br>
Myst (6 million)[11]<br>
SimCity 3000 (5 million; includes Sim City 3000 Unlimited edition)[12]<br>

            <p><span class="mention">@ODB</span> CoD has through the roof sales. Anything with that many sales is going to hurt sales of other games. I’m sure there’s tons of people out there that didn’t buy a quality game because they were saving their money for Black Ops.</p>

<p>Infinity Ward / Treyarch works for a niche market. They haven’t done anything but MoH and CoD. Why would try their luck by losing their well-established jobs?</p>
<p>The only thing I feel sorry for is that there’s little hope for something like Xatrix/Gray Matter ever to emerge again.<br>
No more RTCW, Redneck Rampage, Kingpin.</p>

            <p>Weapon inaccuracy isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Weapons in BFBC2 are infinitely less accurate than in CoD but BFBC2 is an amazing game.</p>
<p>Everything else, yeah it’s a problem. Also, CoD severely hurts sales of any other franchise. And finally, CoD breads masses of ignorant fanboys who think CoD is the only game in the entire world worth playing.</p>

<p>Sad but true, I really hate the bloody screen instead of health bar.  I’m o.k. with poor weapon accuracy because for game play it helps make the guns different and balance more powerful weapons.  I also dislike kill streaks.</p>
