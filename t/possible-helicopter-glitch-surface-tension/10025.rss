    <title>Possible Helicopter Glitch? - Surface Tension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/possible-helicopter-glitch-surface-tension/10025</link>
    <description>On the cliff side helicopter fight, I hit the helicopter with a rocket (or two, can&#39;t remember off of the top of my head) the helicopter seemed to just float there and fire to the left, completely ignoring me.  I was able to walk out and fire my rockets at it until it blew up.  The death animations/explosions all worked fine though.


And sorry, I forget to take screenshots. :/</description>
