    <title>Games that you have bought twice</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/games-that-you-have-bought-twice/8303</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m curious, what games have you guys had that you thought were so good that you bought them again &gt; whether because something was wrong with yours, or you just liked it that much or a sale or something?

I bought Battlefield 2 again after PB banned me for no reason. That&#39;s how much I loved that game.

Also bought JK and JO again because they were on sale with others.

If you haven&#39;t bought any twice, is there any you&#39;d consider buying again?</description>

            <p>I have HL1 and it’s expansions still on CD, used them to register it on Steam.</p>
<p>Then years ago I bought HL1 on the PS2, mostly for Decay. Sold that years ago.</p>
<p>Then I got the Orange Box for my Xbox360. Then bought the Orange box for the PC, gave my mate the 360 version.</p>

            <p>Mass Effect 1 and 2<br>
The Witcher</p>
<p>with ME1 i bought it but lost the CDkey and couldn’t install it again when i had to reformat my harddrive. was too lazy to do anything about it so i bought it on steam</p>
<p>ME2 i bought the collectors edition retail and then later it was on sale on steam and so i got it so i could once again be lazy when it came to installing it again on a different machine</p>
<p>The witcher i also bought retail having no idea what it was, i literally bought it off of “I just finished the semester, this is a game i haven’t heard of and it apparently won some stuff” then because of the patches and shenanigans i couldn’t get it to work, so i went the lazy rout once again and bought it while it was on sale on steam. for a “i’ll get it just because” game it turned out to be my favorite RPG still today.</p>
<p>so basically i buy games twice if i’m feeling lazy and it goes on sale on steam…</p>

<p>PC port isn’t out yet- it’s slated to come out on Steam around the time of the Windows Phone 7 version, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_CD#Digital_releases" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">according to Wikipedia.</a>There is however a port for iPhone/iPad and the Android in addition to the PSN/XBLA versions. It’s pretty much being ported to every popular interface known to man.</p>
<p>There IS a PC version already, but that’s the Windows 9x version, you’ll need third party patches to get it working right, and it only comes with the English soundtrack by default. (Concievably, you can swap out the music files and rename them so the game’s code will run the Japanese OSTs, but it’s a better idea to just get the 2011 version because it not only sounds but plays better)</p>

Second time was because my PC apparently didn’t like the Allied disc, it was destroyed by my CD-drive (weird noises and crack noise occured, the disc was scratched all over and split in two, never happened afterwards lol)</p>
<p>3rd time was in the First Decade pack with all C&amp;C games up to Generals: Zero Hour, because C&amp;C is/<span class="bbcode-b">was</span> awesome.</p>

<p>If I ever bought a pre-built machine again, I’d go Alienware. The first one I bought was amazing. The case is very well built and the internals are still being used, albeit in a different case! Although I’m not sure what they’re like now though, I got mine before Dell came in. A friend of mine bought one recently and is pleased with it, there was a problem with the PSU but someone came round and replaced it for him within a day or two!</p>
<p>Incredible value for money (and there’s a lot of money :fffuuu <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>

            <p>I bought Fable once, then someone else trashed my CD and I had to buy a new one, though I forced the price on them.</p>
<p>Then I bought WoW + BC twice because I needed a new account, but I think my brother actually payed for that.</p>
<p>Then I had to get Diablo 2 again because the CD mysteriously dissappeared. But then I didn’t because I got it for my birthday.</p>
<p>So I haven’t really bought anything twice, but I have gotten them twice. I don’t generally pay much for games, anyway, and I’m smart enough to get them for the PC in the first place and not fuck about with consoles. (Hah)</p>

<p>If I ever bought a pre-built machine again, I’d go Alienware. The first one I bought was amazing. The case is very well built and the internals are still being used, albeit in a different case! Although I’m not sure what they’re like now though, I got mine before Dell came in. A friend of mine bought one recently and is pleased with it, there was a problem with the PSU but someone came round and replaced it for him within a day or two!</p>
<p>Incredible value for money (and there’s a lot of money :fffuuu <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>

            <p>I first bought Fallout 3 for PS3. After I got hooked, I absolutely had to buy it on Steam so I could play it with mods.</p>

            <p>Quite a few actually, I had loads on disc and then later on they turned up on Steam. And I’m lazy like that (I mean, no worries about losing the disc or updates or whatever).</p>
<p>Dead Space 2, Red Alert 3, Command and Conquer 3, Half-Life 1, Unreal/Unreal Tournament, few others.</p>
<p>Only get them when they’re on sale though, no point in paying full price again.</p>

            <p>Diablo 1. Bought it twice before we figured out you could copy the CD instead of doing a spawn version to play on lan or BNET.</p>
<p>D2 as well to play on BNET, but one of the CD keys got smudged, so it became useless.</p>
