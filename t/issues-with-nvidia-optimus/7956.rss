    <title>Issues With Nvidia Optimus</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/issues-with-nvidia-optimus/7956</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got a laptop that uses an Nvidia 310M/Intel hybrid graphics. It&#39;s an interesting (and ridiculously flawed) system. One of the flaws is that, when my computer auto-switches from GPU to GPU, my screen brightness gets changed. I can&#39;t figure out how to get this to stop, as it seems to be part of the Nvidia drivers, Nvidia&#39;s control panel is the GUI equivalent of the Tunguska event.</description>
