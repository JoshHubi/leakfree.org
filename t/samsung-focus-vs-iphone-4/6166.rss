    <title>Samsung Focus vs iPhone 4</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/samsung-focus-vs-iphone-4/6166</link>
    <description>In about a week I get my upgrade from AT&amp;T, and I&#39;m torn between getting the Samsung Focus and the iPhone 4. I&#39;ve already done extensive research on them, but I&#39;m still unsure which I should choose, being that on many counts they are quite similar, and the rest seems to be mainly preference. So I&#39;m wondering if you guys can weigh in with some factual pros and cons on either phone. Price is not a factor, as it will be bought by my company. Here&#39;s what I do with my iPhone 3G currently:

-texting a few times a day
-2 or 3 phone calls a day
-writing two to four sentences a day in notes
-alarm
-web browsing about 20-30 minutes a day
-take pictures maybe a few times a month
-maps a few times a month
-1 hotmail account, 1 exchange
-music on headphones half an hour or so every few days
-less than half a page of 3rd party apps, of which only 1 or 2 see usage more than once a month

As you can see, I&#39;m not a real heavy-duty phone user. Things like multi-tasking and copy/paste hardly matter to me. I guess things more along my lines of concern are build quality, durability (how easy does it get scratched, break when dropped), support, call quality, etc.  Your thoughts?</description>

            <p>I agree, we also have to remember what IOS was like back in the early days, i know because i was using it. Its taken a number of years to get where iPhones are today. Sure, WP7 has it bugs, but in my opinion its started out on such a great base, it’ll only get better yet.</p>

<p>Actually the iPhone 3Gs uses a different processor to the iPhone 4. And the iPhone 4 CPU hasn’t been clocked, at least according to Wikipedia. The 1Ghz statistic comes from the iPad, which has the same processor.</p>

<p>In the spirit of full disclosure, you can do that on an iPhone too. Just press the center button twice while on the lock screen.</p>
<p>But otherwise I hope you enjoy your phone! The better every brand becomes, the better all the other ones have to become to compete.</p>

            <p>Well I got me a Samsung Focus today, and I am really quite pleased with it. I love the look of the UI, and it’s snappy even with the little animations it does. The touchscreen is very nice, like I said earlier, on par with the iPhone’s as far as response goes. The screen itself is bright and vibrant, in fact it can be almost painful when the brightness is set too high. I just wish it had a tad more resolution, as small text appears a little fuzzy, but otherwise its great. Pictures and HD video look awesome. The build of the phone makes it very lightweight, but IMHO it doesn’t feel cheap. Music player is very good (I tried out Zune last night to see what I was in for and was already impressed). I like that when you lock your phone with music playing, pressing the lock button again brings up the lock screen with a mini-player on top you can use to play, pause, or change tracks. Nice feature, not so necessary with the headphones they give you since they have in-line controls, but good for using with your own headphones. Apps and games are already pouring in, and most of the ones I used before I have installed again.</p>
<p>That’s about all I’ve had time to see about my phone so far, have yet to try out the camera and such. I’m pleased and I don’t think I’ll want to return it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Oh and btw johnyo, the Focus also has 512mb of RAM. Some sites had stated that it had 256mb, probably before launch, so you may have heard that before the correction was made.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to test the UI, since it’s pretty much the same in all versions of iOS. (is it?  I assume it is)  I kinda wish they had an iPhone 4 on display in the store, but they didn’t.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve pretty much made up my mind to get the Samsung Focus.  Hope it doesn’t suck  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
I’ll get an iPod Touch at some point if I still care about the stuff that I want that is exclusive to iTunes. (just a few games that are probably a disappointment and might get ported in the future anyway, plus this webcomic I used to read)</p>

<p>Would you really want to hold one up to your ear?  It’s too big for that.</p>
<p>I tried out both the Focus and an iPhone 3 yesterday (wasn’t too bothered about them not having an iPhone 4 on display because it’s the same OS) and neither really stood out as being “the one” so I’m at an impasse again.</p>
<p>Do I want to go with the proven tech that already has a ton of third party support, or do I want to go with the new tech that could end up being better, or may be unsupported in 2-5 years? (I don’t plan on getting another new phone any time soon, whatever I get I’ll stick with for a long time) I really don’t know.  I need to go deeper.</p>

<p>I think iphone/ipod touch is the only true example of this. They really haven’t made brilliant strides in the computer market, especially not with desktops.

<p>I think you’re confusing his general statement with your own personal hangups with Mac OS X. The point of Sersoft’s post was that the iPhone, the iPad and Mac aren’t extraordinary at all; all three of those things (smartphones, tablets and, you know, computers) have been around for ages, but Mac are adept at dressing things up in shiny, easy-to-use packages and marketing the crap out of them to the public to make them sell.</p>
<p>And see? I stayed completely out of your points about OS X. No need to have <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> thread again.</p>

            <p>Fact: Apple designed the iPad before the iTouch and the iPhone.</p>
<p>I can say bad things about apple all day but they are truly gods among men in terms of marketing strategies.</p>
