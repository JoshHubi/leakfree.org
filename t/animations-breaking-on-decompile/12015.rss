    <title>Animations breaking on Decompile.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/animations-breaking-on-decompile/12015</link>
    <description>I just thought I would start a seperate thread for this as ive been unable to find a solution to my problem.

I wish to rig my hand model onto the BM view models for the mod Black-Mesa: Insecurity and ive run into a problem, when I decompile BM&#39;s view models the animations break! the hand models animations don&#39;t function correctly and their origin is offset massively as seen here:

Does anyone know what causes this? ive tried several different versions of mdldec and all have had the same result. I really need help guys either a solution or maybe a BM dev can give me the source files? (wishfull thinking perhaps).

If someone has a solution and wants to rig and compile the models for us then they will get full credit in BMI but I will settle simply for a fix or the unbroken source files. We need you guys!!! :&#39;(</description>

            <p>I don’t think anyone’s needed to decompile the hands. Would it be possible to reanimate them from scratch? Sure, it could be time consuming, but you may end up with potential better results.</p>
