    <title>Invisible floor... [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/invisible-floor-fixed/9945</link>
    <description>First of all i would like to thank all people working on this project. Its absolutely wonderful to see one of the greatest game remade in source engine. The execution its almost perfect. When i play with lights out and headphones on i fell like i am playing real HL game for the first time in a long time. I like that puzzles and levels are bit different it gives some level of freshness without destroying the the feel of Black Mesa.

There are some things though that unfortunately don&#39;t go as planed. In Chapter called &#39;&#39;ON RAIL&#39;&#39; when you finish first series of tracks you are forced to go through inside of a silo. There is addition of maintenance platforms that have to be lowered in order to lunch the satellite. Two soldiers are spawned as soon as you enter the silo and run through those platforms to get you. It is possible to run pass them and hit the button while they are standing on the platform (sometimes you have to lure them back in if the go to far). Unfortunately the don&#39;t fall  :frowning:  they just walk on the thin air. It takes out some immersion and i am sure it wasn&#39;t intended. 

I know its only a minor issue but it would be nice to see it fixed. Thanks again for astonishingly beautiful and climatic mod. Congratulations to whole team.
