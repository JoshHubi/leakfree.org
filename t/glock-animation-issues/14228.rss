    <title>Glock animation issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glock-animation-issues/14228</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve come across two animation issues with the Glock. Fairly minor, but bothersome:

* There&#39;s an improper loop of the right-hand thumb on the &quot;idle1&quot; sequence. It drifts to the right slightly over the course of animating, then snaps back to its initial location on the left at the end. Looking over the rest of the Glock sequences, it seems &quot;draw1&quot; and &quot;holster&quot;  use the &quot;left&quot; location, while all other sequences use the &quot;right&quot; location.
* When picking up physics objects, there is a noticeable delay before holstering the Glock, compared to other weapons.


Also not a problem with the animations itself, but should the &quot;idle_fidget&quot; sequence be examining the magazine? Other weapons only do that in &quot;draw_admire&quot;, seems odd to make the gun (realistically) inoperable with it. Plus, I love that slide draw back on the first pickup, would rather see that there.</description>
