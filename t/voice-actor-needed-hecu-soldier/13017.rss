    <title>Voice Actor Needed! - HECU SOLDIER</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/voice-actor-needed-hecu-soldier/13017</link>
    <description>Crowbar Collective is looking for a NEW voice for the HECU Soldier!

The ideal applicant will provide dry recordings from a dead room. I know that sounds gross, so let me clarify. 

A dry recording is a recording with no added effects. We are more interested in your performance than your audio mixing skills. 
A dead room is a quiet, echo-free recording space. No reverb, street sounds, roommates, hisses or hums in the background.

We&#39;re also looking for somebody with access to quality recording equipment, and the ability to record while on Skype for voice direction.

We hope this opportunity will bring in a lot of talented actors, so please understand that we will not be able to respond to every application. We&#39;ll let you know when we want to hear more.

We&#39;d also like to know which voice the community prefers. 
Once you&#39;re done, feel free to share the audition with your fellow interwebbers!
[b]#blackmesavoice #newhecu #crowbarcollective[/b]

If you don&#39;t think you have the pipes/gear for the job, then please help point any qualified voice actors towards this jobs posting.

Email [email]jobs@blackmesasource.com[/email] with an outline of:

* the equipment you used during recording
* your availability
* the files/links of your Black Mesa recordings
* if available, files/links for any past voice acting work


Thanks!

[b]CHARACTER[/b]

* I&#39;ve killed twelve of these dumbass scientists, and not one of &#39;ems fought back... This SUCKS!
* I didn&#39;t sign on for this shit. Monsters? Hell yeah. But civilians? Who ordered this damn operation anyway?



[b]DISCUSSION[/b]
(You only need to record one scene, but please play both soldiers)

HECU 1: Where are we taking this Freeman guy?
HECU 2: Topside for questioning.
HECU 1: What the hell for? We got him. Let&#39;s kill him now.
HECU 2: Uh... and if they find the body?
HECU 1: Body? What body?
HECU 1 &amp; 2 laugh.

[i]- OR -[/i]

HECU 1: So, who is this guy, Freeman?
HECU 2: They say he was at Ground Zero.
HECU 1: Science team... You think he was responsible? Sabotage, maybe?
HECU 2: Yeah, maybe. All I know for sure is he&#39;s been killing my buddies.
HECU 1: Oh yeah, he&#39;ll pay. He will definitely pay.


[b]COMBAT[/b]
(This section is meant to show how well your gear can hold up to yelling, screaming, high-energy performances)



* Shit! We got hostiles!
* Squad! Stay down!
* Squad! We got Freeman!
* We&#39;ve got uglies!
* Loose frag!
* Go! Recon!
* Medic!
* Move in!
* Clear this area!


[b]CHATTER[/b]

* Recon in position. All quiet.
* Squad, spread out.
* Movement check, over.
* Look-out, check in.
* Sector Secure. Over.
* That&#39;s an affirmative, sir.
* This mission is way beyond FUBAR.
* OK mission, zero niner.
* Look-out Post: All quiet. Over.
* Sir, I hear something.



[b]EXTRA CREDIT[/b]
Send us a short piece (maximum 1 min) of your HECU Soldier in a scenario of your choosing.
This does not have to be constrained to a Half-Life combat situation. You can put your own twist on the character. 
Read passages from medical dictionaries, freestyle rap, yell at your neighbors no good dog that just won&#39;t shut up. 
We&#39;re looking forward to hearing what you come up with.

<p>Well, considering this thread is 5 years old, your voice would have been even less suitable since you were 14 when they actually needed it <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Also, FUBAR is alternately defined as “Fucked Up Beyond All Repair.” Actual jargon also has plenty of other abbreviations, like SNAFU or TARFU. The latter-most is pretty appropriate for Black Mesa- “Things Are Really Fucked Up.”</p>

            <p>If anyone wants a good reference for what marines would realistically sound like in combat, I think DICE actually did an amazing job with their voice work for BF3 and BF4.</p>
<p>Here’s a bunch of sound bits some guy compiled from both games:<br>

            <p>Just throwing it in here.<br>
Can you not just ask Valve on what they did to distort the voices in HL1?</p>
<p>P.S. Got amused by this.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>the sentence would then be “This mission is way beyond fucked up beyond all recognition.” That makes no sense.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But they actually say</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">‘This mission is way beyond <span class="bbcode-b">FUBAR</span>’</span></p>
<p>and not</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">‘This mission is way beyond <span class="bbcode-b">fucked up beyond all recognition</span>’</span>, right?</p>
<p>If you would’ve been less of a wise-ass, you’d have realised that FUBAR is an actual established <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">adjective</span></span>. Therefore the rules that apply for any other adjectives apply here as well.</p>
<p>Besides:<br>

            <p>I vote for Eric Brown, all the combat sounds sound true to the original but in higher quality. Good talent.<br>
One scene I think you should redo though is the On a Rail Rocket scene, the guy who says “all I know is he’s been killing my buddies” sounds like Jethro from Beverly hillbillies.</p>

            <p>Since this is still open, I’d better get some lines done!</p>
<p>EDIT: Argh, my microphone is being super shitty when I’m yelling into it. Sound gets soooo distorted.</p>
<p>EDIT <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> I have a second mic- an old Xbox throat mic I got back when Modern Warfare 2 was in its heyday. It has the benefit of a tinny sound to it, making my voice already sound a bit like its been run through a high pass filter and is much quieter, so I can project more.</p>
<p>EDIT <span class="hashtag">#3:</span> Actually, loud dialog sounds EVEN SHITTIER. Argh. I think I’ll wait for tomorrow morning to let my vocal chords recharge, and then try it with the mic on my HV30 camera to see if I can cut down on the distortion.</p>

            <p>I hope all the people who submitted at the wrong address found out about the new one…</p>
<p>It’d be a real shame to miss out on some talent because of a fatal mistake like that.</p>
<p>Maybe you should try to spread awareness, first by contacting people in the thread who said they submitted theirs, then by posting news of the mistake in other places.</p>

<p>Alright, sent in my audition. I was worried that little improve section I thought up while in the booth would go over a minute; turns out it was just barley in the safe zone! I also made a wet mix in 5 minutes just for the hell of it. Let me know what you guys think and what I could do to improve!</p>

            <p>This is probably really late, but I just remembered something.</p>
<p>You should really consider changing the “We’ve got uglies” line back to “We’ve got hostiles”. The chapter WGH was named after it, it just doesn’t make a lot of sense to have it gone.</p>
