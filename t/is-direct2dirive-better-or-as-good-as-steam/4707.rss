            <p>I find D2D just about as good. I’ll get something from there if it’s cheaper, and it does mean I don’t have to have Steam running. Plus, I can usually still get it to run with Steam anyway (unless the game is stupid, like GTA4)<br>
Another store I’ve used for two games so far is Impulse<br>

            <p>I’ve never used D2D, but Steam has an integrated community and update support, and as such is infinitely better.</p>
<p>Plus Valve makes it.</p>
