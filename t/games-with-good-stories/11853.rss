            <p>Fallout.</p>
<p>The only other fallout story to come close to the original is New Vegas. It still however didn’t catch the sheer desolation and desperation of the world like the original did.</p>
<p>I really do wish someone would just have the balls to make a post nuclear holocaust isometric RPG that is realistic. Imagine the size of the worlds you could create using 90s graphics and modern day memory. Walking around a full scale nuked L.A with a few friends would be beyond awesome.</p>
<p>Bioware really did piss me off with the new KoToR. They have one of the best expanded universe stories out there and they throw it out the window in order to cash in on the MMORPG market. Now it’s free to play and I still haven’t had the interest to play it.</p>
<p>99% of Star Wars EU and games aren’t worth the effort it takes to learn about them, whilst the other 1% that fans latch on to more than most gets milked and driven into the ground, or alternatively stopped half way through and never heard from again.</p>
<p>They have decades of potential mass market money making gems just waiting for someone with an actual passion for the franchise and making games to come along and reinvigorate the most over sold franchise in history beyond anything the 90s did. Yet mediocrity flourishes because it’s fucking easier and no one in charge clearly gives a shit. /rant</p>
<p>Not that I’m bitter about being continually shoveled shit and being told it’s sugar in regards to one of my most beloved franchises as a kid. Not at all…</p>

Both are fantastic at storytelling and make you play through again and again.</p>

</aside>
<p>Aye.  If you’re <span class="bbcode-i">only</span> looking for story, Dear Esther is definitely worth a try.  Be aware that it doesn’t have any “gameplay,” per se, though; a lot of people have been really taken aback by it.  I’m saying this as someone who loves it, by the way.</p>
<p>For my money, one of the best story-oriented games I’ve played in a long while was Bastion, which is a top-down action sort of game.</p>
<p>Others:<br>
Mass Effect<br>
Metro 2033<br>
the Half-Life series (naturally)<br>
The original FEAR actually had a pretty good story, in my opinion<br>
Zeno Clash: Bizarre and a bit clumsily executed, but still a really different and interesting story<br>
The two Batman games (Arkham Asylum and Arkham City)<br>
I’ll add Prey as a maybe</p>

            <p>Cave Story actually had a pretty intriguing story. Lots of twists, including some things that you think would’ve been obvious from the start, humorously enough.</p>

<p>Even though Skyrim overall is probably more fun, Oblivion’s side quests were a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> better and were just more interesting to actually play through. (lost interest in the MQ not too far in)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I haven’t played a whole lot of Oblivion, but it really did have some excellent quests. They were a lot more dynamic, too; you could, for instance, finish a quest just by going straight to the bad guy’s house and taking the incriminating evidence you were supposed to pick up way at the end. Far too many of Skyrim’s quests were just disguised dungeon fetch quests (The theive’s guild quests were particularly awful like that.)</p>
<p>And, IMO, the biggest problem with the MQ in Skyrim is that it gets boring in the middle. Some of the later quests, particularly Blackreach, were pretty good.</p>

            <p>I generally find every Bethseda RPG that I play has a very weak main questline purely to allow players to say “fuck the main quest” and go do tons of side content. The lack of narrative pull in Oblivion, Skyrim, and to a lesser extent Fallout 3, really gets to me. I like games that have strong stories. Hence the “Role Playing” in the RPG.</p>
<p>I mean, I don’t dress up like an elf when I play Legend of Zelda, I’m not a lunatic. But I do appreciate a strong narrative when it comes to RPGs, which is why I would pick Persona 4 over any Elder Scrolls game anyday.</p>

<p>Skyrim had dozens of good side quests. It’s a fucking crime to hate on it simply because of the main questline. (Which I enjoyed except for basically every single one of the Blades quests. At least Delphine spends so much time standing right next to a cliff.)</p>

<p>Even though Skyrim overall is probably more fun, Oblivion’s side quests were a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> better and were just more interesting to actually play through. some things may have been ehh about Oblivion, but the side quests were phenomenal. I honestly really only did the side quests in Skyrim (lost interest in the MQ not too far in)</p>
<p>The guilds in particular were pretty bad in Skyrim (don’t even get me started on the thieves guild), and most of the Daedric quests were black-and-white 123 without anything to them really, with the exception of a couple.</p>

            <p>Ah, c’mon, it’s not <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> bad. There’s plenty of other story-oriented stuff in that game to keep it interesting.</p>

            <p>Skyrim’s story is pretty damaged by the overall genericness of Dragons as a main adversary, and the unbelievably shitty writing and almost juvenile direction they took the plot with.</p>
<p>I mean seriously, it felt like it was made by a kid who was like “WOULDN’T IT BE SUPER COOL IF WE COULD HAVE A GAME WHERE YOU KILL DRAGONS AND THEY CAN TALK!”</p>

<p>As I understand it, Mirror’s Edge used to have a good story, but it was completely wrecked during development for some reason. There’s barely a story at all now.</p>

</aside>
<p>not to mention the worst fucking cut scenes</p>
<p>good thing the gameplay is fun</p>

            <p>^ Gears’ story really isn’t anything to write home about. Particularly GoW 2 and Dom bitching about his fucking wife for half the fucking game.</p>
