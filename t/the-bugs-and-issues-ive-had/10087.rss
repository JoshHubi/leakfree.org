    <description>headcrab latch is classic purple n black gmod style error and doesent work half the time  :frowning: 

the part with multiple grinders is astronomically hard to jump

the catwalk parts first catwalk seems to be an invisible angled wall flinging me off at 2000 miles an hour


and security guards dont shoot zombies unles they are farther than 4 feet away


everything else is awesome though especially soldier ai, it makes me believe they are trying to kill me :freeman:</description>
