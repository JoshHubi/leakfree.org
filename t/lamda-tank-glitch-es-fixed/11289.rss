The last tank you meet in the game, the one just before the Lamda lab, seems be quite glitchy. When I approach the doors leading to the room it&#39;s in, it suddenly turns it&#39;s turret as far as it will go (Seems to only go 90 degrees in either direction) and completely ignores the vortigaunts shooting lightning at it. (Not that they do any damage). This tank is completely focused on me, even though it can&#39;t hit me. I can leave the room, go as far back the way I came as I can, and it&#39;s still trying to shoot me. What&#39;s more there was a marine phased through the back of the tank.

One time, I was stupid enough to walk in front of the cannon, thinking the tank was dead. I learned the hard way that the cannon still worked.</description>
