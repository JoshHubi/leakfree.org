    <title>Is owning it enough?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-owning-it-enough/4372</link>
    <description>Alright, I searched around for this, but could not find the answer. It is a quick and simple question, and if it already has been answered, then apologies, and there is no need to spit in my direction, but a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; will do. 

Here goes.. It was stated that to play BMS one would just need to own one of the Steam games listed. That&#39;s great, but would we need to have one of those games actually installed on the machine, or just having bought it on Steam would suffice? 

Say I have played Ep.2 before, but now have it uninstalled from my machine, would I need to re-install it before playing BMS?</description>

            <p>If you have L4D2, you should have Source SDK Base 2007 anyway, so it doesn’t really matter.</p>

            <p>This doesn’t affect me, but I’m still curious:</p>
<p>does having Source SDK Base 2009 (from l4d2 for instance) let us play BMS, or does it not include the same necessary binaries as 2007?</p>

            <p>The source SDK is used for making maps, using faceposer, etc.<br>
The source SDK Base is used for mods that run on the episode 1 engine.<br>
The source SDK Base 2007 (formerly OrangeBox) is used for mods that run on the engine released with the orange box.<br>
Then there’s the 2009 engine, which is what the latest games run on.</p>

<p>To sum up and help avoid confusion:<br>
yesTechnically the question was answered, but my guess was in this case you don’t have enough experience with mods to really understand the answer that was given. Some mods use resources that are game specific, and as such require you to own a specific game. Black Mesa states that it only needs Source SDK Base 2007 installed, which you are given access to with any source game that actually had money paid for them (freebies, such as the ATI/NVidia deal for HL2: DM, and the free Portal special that ran a couple weeks ago don’t count, but if you purchased a copy, or if a friend purchased a copy and gifted it to you, it would count)<br>
You’ll find it in the tool tabs under your library section in your steam window (provided you have access to it) If you install a mod that only needs source SDK base or Source SDK Base 2007, then when you try to run it, it will download and install those automatically (if you haven’t already done it manually yourself)<br>
So just owning the game would suffice. You don’t need to have THAT game installed, but what you do need installed is the Source SDK Base 2007.</p>
<p>No, you don’t need to reinstall that. However if you want to be able to play the mod as soon as you can download it, then I recommend that you make sure to go into your tools tab and have Source Base SDK 2007  downloaded, so that you don’t have to wait for it to finish downloading after you finally get ahold of the Black Mesa mod itself.</p>

<p>You are correct, sir. Don’t know why they changed the label from Orange Box to 2007, but there you go. Also if anyone refers to “The Ep2 engine” it means the same thing.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The reason they changed it is probably for the exact reason that λdam just mentioned; you get it with ANY source game, not only when you purchase Orange Box, so why would they continue to call it the orange box engine?</p>

            <p>Huh. I own the games that are included in the Orange Box, but I didn’t buy the Orange Box. I bought each game individually (Stupid, I know) but at first, all I wanted was TF2 and CSS, then I bought the Episode pack, then eventually I bought Portal, then Keresh gifted me HL2. But I don’t have Source SDK Base - Orange Box in the tools section.</p>
<p>All I have is Source SDK, Source SDK Base and Source SDK Base 2007. Are those OK?</p>

<p>No, you don’t need to reinstall that. However if you want to be able to play the mod as soon as you can download it, then I recommend that you make sure to go into your tools tab and have Source Base SDK 2007  downloaded, so that you don’t have to wait for it to finish downloading after you finally get ahold of the Black Mesa mod itself.</p>

<p>Except no.  What you need to have installed is the Source SDK Base and Source SDK Base Orange Box, which should be in your “tools” tab if you own a legitimate copy of Ep2.</p>

            <p>Alright, I searched around for this, but could not find the answer. It is a quick and simple question, and if it already has been answered, then apologies, and there is no need to spit in my direction, but a simple “Yes” or “No” will do.</p>
<p>Here goes… It was stated that to play BMS one would just need to own one of the Steam games listed. That’s great, but would we need to have one of those games actually installed on the machine, or just having bought it on Steam would suffice?</p>
<p>Say I have played Ep.2 before, but now have it uninstalled from my machine, would I need to re-install it before playing BMS?</p>
