            <p>Evil Dead is a nice piece of work. It’s also one of those movies that can definitely be made into something better. I’m interested in someone new playing Ash. I think making his character an old fart just so Bruce Campell can play him would be a dumb idea, unless it turns out to be a sequel.</p>
<p>If it’s a remake, whoever plays Ash ought to have distinctive features, if not be fuck ugly. The boyish good looks of modern day actors just won’t cut it IMO</p>
