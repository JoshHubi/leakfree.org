    <title>Gulon Gun Fire effect persists after death in Multiplayer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gulon-gun-fire-effect-persists-after-death-in-multiplayer/14032</link>
    <description>This happened on the Offical BMS Deathmatch Server. I was killed while firing the Gulon gun and the firing effect persisted after death on all guns, including grenades and the bug... things.  It didn&#39;t disappear after shooting but it did after dying a few times.

sorry for no getpos or status. I didn&#39;t know

I cant upload the screenshots here for some reason so here is an imgur album

            <p>Happened to me as well. I’ll note that gluon effects also remain on the map at the spot where you were when you died, and that the effect is nullified if you pick up the gluon gun again.</p>
