<p>Then you must have played the PC version. I know Rockstar released the PC version as uncensored.</p>
<p>Though I enjoyed it. I actually found the censorship to be humorous and fitting to the over the top gratuitous nature to the game. Simply because it’s essentially saying, “oh we have to censor ourselves because some righteous prick says we have to, so we’ll make it as ridiculous as possible.”</p>
<p>And it was a fun game to boot.</p>

<li>The Mech costumization options from Mechwarrior 2 and 3.<br>
[COLOR=‘red’]Make a step backwards compared to Mechwarrior 4? No.</li>
<li>MW4 was too cartoony in my opinion.<br>
[COLOR=‘red’]It wasn’t. Moreover, mech models and animations were the best in the series.</li>
<li>A soundtrack from Jeehun Hwang (MW2 series).<br>
[COLOR=‘Red’]Duane Decker was cooler, but nothing would beat the amalgam of them and that guy who did music for mw4:mercs</li>
<li>Ooh… and melee combat on capable Mech’s, like in the novels… Having an Atlas pick up and smash a 25 ton light Mech is pure awesomenesss.<br>

            <p>Oh come on! Nobody ever heard of Legacy of Kain? This game series has one of the best story lines ever and yet, it’s about vampires. This totally beats the shit out of any modern vampire story you can think of. Though I don’t see how it could be continued, I’d like to see more of it. Too bad the two companies involved got mad at each other.</p>
<p>Basically, the game isn’t as much gameplay as story telling, it’s full of cutscenes and yet, it’s much better than what it sounds. The gameplay combines puzzle and combat and honestly, I get stuck at almost each new puzzle as the series progress. And the first game is even 2D!</p>
<p>I definitely recommend this game. Hope these get you involved:</p>
