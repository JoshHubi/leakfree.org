    <title>Hideo Kojima and other &quot;key devs&quot; supposedly leaving Konami after MGSV</title>

    <description>[url]https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-expected-to-leave-konami-after-mgs5-inside-/1100-6426024/[/url]

Apparently Kojima didn&#39;t really want to make the last few MGS games, but the way he&#39;s talked about 5, it seems like this was the game he had always wanted to make. Not sure if this is Kojima&#39;s doing or if he and Konami were having some misunderstandings. Not sure what&#39;ll end up happening with the new Silent Hill and MGO (though I imagine MGO wouldn&#39;t be affected since it&#39;s a separate team anyway). Also sucks for people who wanted a new ZoE game.</description>

            <p>Kojima has not been heard from for days now, and his usually-bustling twitter account hasn’t had even so much as a single food pic posted on it since the 18th.<br>
I hope he’s alright.</p>

<p>Doubt it. Konami also gets to keep the Fox Engine, which Kojima and his team spent forever making. So they get to make one game on it and then it’s going to be used from now on for PES and MGS knock-offs.</p>

<p>That’s bullshit.</p>
<p>So I guess Kojima will finally fulfill his dream of not working on another Metal Gear game. Wonder what will happen to Silent Hills though.</p>
