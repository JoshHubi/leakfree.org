    <title>L4D Series:  Overrated and Waste of Development Time</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/l4d-series-overrated-and-waste-of-development-time/2203</link>
    <description>Hire me Valve, I will work 18 hours a day on the only game true fans care about.

The Half-Life series.

Best single player games ever.
Best story in a video game ever.  In fact, the only story I have ever cared about in any video game.

There is so much to the HL series.  I&#39;m saddened to see that they put development time in to something their real fans don&#39;t even care about.

HL2: Raising the Bar is the most inspiring book I own.  Nothing about the L4D series can compare to that.</description>

            <p>Katamarikitten… the date format of this forum is  day / month / year. This means the post before yours was 19th, January, 2010.</p>
<p>You bumped a 5 month old thread. This is why folks are trying to set fire to you.  Enjoy your crispyness with tender joy; we only fry those we love.  (right?)  And we love new folks.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Anyway. Katamarikitten now understands the format, and the rest of us can stop posting and let this die.</p>

<p>No, I’m serious L4D is overrated.  Little replayability and boring game.</p>
<p>Awwwwww are you mad someone doesn’t wike your wittle game?</p>
<p>You go fuck yourself, cunt fuck.</p>
<p>Someone asked what I consider good with a lot of replayability.</p>
<p>Let’s see…</p>
<p>HL Series:<br>
Best story in gaming by far, good gameplay, able to tackle situations in different ways each time.</p>
<p>CoD MW/MW2:<br>
Good maps, tons of guns and unlocks, tons of game modes.  Switch classes during games and completely change your style of play.</p>
<p>League of Legends/Heroes of Newerth:<br>
Dozens of champions in both games, different game every time.</p>
<p>Those are actually the only 3 games I consistently play.</p>
<p>Then we have L4D 1/2:<br>
4 big maps (campaigns), limited weapon selection (L4D2 changed this but still, new weapons got boring fast).  For the most part it’s the same every time.</p>
<p>Where is the replayability in that?</p>
<p>Edit again:</p>
<p>Adding Crysis to the list of replayability</p>
<p>Crysis:<br>
Weapon customization is extremely well done.  Suit options and open world allow you to play each mission dozens of different ways.  I load up the game a couple times a week to play through a few different levels and try out different ways of completing them.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ugh. Just… No.<br>
Crysis = Replayability?  Are you a blind 12-year-old kid?<br>
And you also have hopped on the MW2 band-wagon? I agree it is a DECENT game, but in my opinion, there are better.</p>
<p>I will list a few flaws in your theorem about Modern Welfare 2 :<br>
-Overpowered killstreaks<br>
-Tactical Insertions<br>
-Glitches<br>
-“Classic” playlist alternative<br>
-Spawning system  (hurdur)<br>
-Overpowered guns<br>
-Snipers suck (ACOG-scope my grandmothers ass)<br>
-Last stand… 'nuff said<br>
-Model 1887 Akimbo HURR DURRRRRR<br>
-Commando knifing<br>
-Maps unappealing</p>
<p>Heroes of Newerth doesn’t appeal to me. It is quite a DotA-clone.</p>
<p>L4D/2 is fun with friends, and I doubt you have any.</p>
<p>It seems that every good forum has a select group of 12-year-olds like you.<br>
Hopefully they permab&amp; your ass</p>

<p>Exactly. Just because you tell a story well, doesn’t mean that the story itself is good.</p>

<p>I was also mildly disappointed about the lack of EP3 news, but come on, get over it already!</p>
<p>Besides, I only played the L4D2 demo on my crappy computer, and it was still awesome. A bit like TF2 graphics-wise, but still awesome.</p>

            <p>While I don’t agree that L4D is a waste of development time, I find <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/zombie-master" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Zombie Master</a> to be a lot more fun, and have more replayability, both made increasingly better because ZM is free. While VALVe made a good game with L4D, the ZM dev team had already beaten them a year prior.</p>
