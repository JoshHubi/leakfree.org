    <description>Is there a way to easily set up/program a drum track?
I&#39;m using Reaper, I&#39;ve looked for a plugin for that in the past, but they were all pretty complicated.

An external program is fine too though. I imagine there&#39;s stuff like this for practising guitar. As long as I can get the track into Reaper somehow.

Any help is appreciated, thanks  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Yeah, I guess it’s okay. Not my cup of tea though. But I’m forced to listen to them sometimes. I can hack it, it certainly isn’t bad.</p>

            <p>Been giving She Wants Revenge a go. I’m not crazy about them, but I like it. Sounds pretty heavily influenced by Joy Division, The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees, as far as I can hear.</p>

            <p>Yeah, maybe I will. I’ve been listening to a lot of Billy Cobham, who’s a fusion drummer. Fabulous musician, makes me want to get into the fusion scene. If there is a fusion scene around here. I don’t think there is.</p>

            <p>Oh, it’s a band, sorry, I should check them out maybe.</p>
<p>Me too really, I’m really into the doors and hendrix and shit, but I guess joy division has been my favourite band/musician for the past year or two.<br>
Probably not unrelated to my personal issues. Sometimes I even feel like I could’ve written the lyrics, given the talent.</p>
<p>Their drummer was pretty damn good though, worth checking out as a drummer (if you’re interested).</p>

            <p>Heh, yeah, if the last track is a work in progress, Ebb and flow hasn’t even really started yet  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I need to play guitar and record way more often, I’ve been at it for years but I’ve barely done anything at all, let alone learned to play properly ^^</p>
<p>edit: btw, maybe you were referring to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PtvIr2oiaE" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> when you said She Wants Revenge? (wild guess here, since that’s partly the inspiration :3)</p>

            <p>Maybe I could even lay down basslines. Been kinda busy lately… but I can probably find the time. Your first track doesn’t seem to go anywhere though. Maybe it could pick up a bit. I think it just fits better acoustically so far.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I think I can do better though lol, if you listen to it without the music it’s absolutely terrible  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Don’t really know Interpol’s music, sadly. One of the many bands and musicians I really should check out. Never even heard of the other one  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And yeah, this could be really fun, I’m looking forward to anything you come up with  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>There’s another track on my soundcloud you could do some drums for if you want, Ebb and flow. It’s currently just an acoustic guitar and singing, the guitar is basically the bassline of the full song I want to make.</p>

            <p>I can do that genre! This could turn out to be quite fun.</p>
<p>Is that you singing? Reminds me of that band Interpol… or She Wants Revenge (I think that’s the name)</p>

            <p>Well, as I said, I consider myself a pretty crappy guitar player, and I’m <span class="bbcode-i">very</span> inexperienced when it comes to recording shit so most of my stuff sounds pretty bad, probably.</p>
<p>If I had to put a genre on it, I’d probably say something like post-punk. Alternative/rock kinda stuff in any case.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ezrazebra-1/she-always-dreams" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this (soundcloud)</a> song that I wish to re-record.<br>
I will probably change the structure of the song somewhat though, and I may want to speed up the rhythm, change the tone of some of the instruments… not 100% sure yet.</p>
<p>If you like, I can send you my REAPER project, may make it easier to add a track.</p>
<p>Would be really cool if you record something, so thanks already  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I’d be happy to. I’m still working out how to decently record my drums so they sound good… But if you send me your stuff, maybe I can do it. Depends on what genre it is though, and such. Not sure how well it would mix with a digital track that’s more electronic sounding. Who knows.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>well, if someone’s willing to record some shit for me, that would be much more awesome  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>but then i’d either have to compose something first anyway, or I’d have to send my “music” so you can add drums, in which case I still don’t have a drum track for re-recording the same track</p>
<p>but if you’d like to record something, i can send you the wip version of what i’m working on ^^</p>
<p>also, may check out garage band, beatcraft seems decent so far, though I don’t have any inspiration atm</p>
<p>ideally i’d just start a band or something, but i still lack the skill and the confidence, both technically and creatively</p>

            <p>Is there a way to easily set up/program a drum track?<br>
I’m using Reaper, I’ve looked for a plugin for that in the past, but they were all pretty complicated.</p>
<p>An external program is fine too though. I imagine there’s stuff like this for practising guitar. As long as I can get the track into Reaper somehow.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated, thanks  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
