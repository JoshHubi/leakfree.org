    <title>Star Trek 3D Animation</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/star-trek-3d-animation/7837</link>
    <description>Its a bit old now, but made a Star Trek themed animation over a year ago.

The models and textures are not high quality as it takes a long time to do all this and the point of this particular movie was to animate various things in tune with the music.

Anyway I uploaded it to youtube, but considering the amount of time it has been there it has not fared too well to comments and views :|

It seems people here are keen to look at other peoples work, so take a look and feedback! (make sure you have sound on though, or you miss the point)   :stuck_out_tongue:

            <p>Salute your work. Agree with the camera angle thing but really surprised with the work. Best of luck mate.</p>

</aside>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Getting the scaling right was something I struggled with. I never liked the size of the earth compared to the dock and starship. Earth seemed too small and also too close, but making it bigger and further away ruined the earth texture, it looks bad enough as it is close up. Me thinks there is a much better way of doing this, also as you say it destroys the illusion of size.</p>
<p>I learned lots while making this movie and will certainly be doing things different in the future.</p>
<p>It was actually a long time ago I made this movie, and have been working on a better animation for a while on and off!</p>
<p>First I need a high poly ship that will look good close up, so far I have made the mesh.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Though it seemed a little jerky (fps perhaps?), however, it could just be me.</p>

            <p>lol - cheers for that danielsangeo (That was really quick too, only just pressed ‘Reply’)</p>
<p>I kind of of ‘knew’ what camera pitch actually ‘is’ - but I guess from my question I fell into that one!</p>
<p>I was kind of hoping for more particular feedback with my animation about what needed more camera pitch. I did use camera pitch…but only when the camera was moving along a track…did it need more? Im pretty new to all this camera stuff, I was always told ‘not’ to move the camera too much?</p>

<p>So, if the ship goes above the camera, point the camera up.  Or point the camera down if the ship goes below it.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Pitch: Look up and down.<br>
Roll: Tilt head sideways.<br>
Yaw: Turn head left or right.</p>

<p>Yup, agree, I never likes the background, or the close up shots of earth, its too blurry!</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, I guess glowing first would have been better and also as you say the stretching be much faster.</p>
<p>Also Savant, yes more polygons would have been nice, but I did not want to spend too much time on high poly models as the aim was to experiment with animation, camera angles and fitting it in time to music. However, what do you mean by more camera pitch - could you explain further  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thanks for feedback so far.</p>
