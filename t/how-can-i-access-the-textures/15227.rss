    <title>How can I access the textures</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-can-i-access-the-textures/15227</link>
    <description>Hi,
Yesterday I went through some of my Black Mesa Source screenshots and found quite a few pictures of posters and such spread around the facility.
Since BMS is one of my favorite games and there isn&#39;t that much merchandise for HL1/BMS I&#39;ve thought about actually getting 1 or 2 of them as actual posters for my room.
One option for that would be to stand like [i]really [/i]close to them, deactivate the HUD and take a screenshot, but I&#39;d really prefer to just take the image file from the textures to get the best resolution.
My only problem is that I don&#39;t know either [i]how [/i]to do it [i](like which folder are they in, what program would I need to unpack them, what format are they)[/i][/size] or whether I&#39;m even allowed to do this since it&#39;s your intellectual property
I&#39;ve thought since it is a fan project and you guys probably love the game as much as I do it doesn&#39;t hurt to ask

            <p>You’ll need <a href="https://nemesis.thewavelength.net/?p=26" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">GCFScape</a> (to unpack the files) and <a href="https://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=41" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">VTFEdit</a> (To read them)</p>
<p>Go to Steamapps/Common/Black Mesa/bms/ and open up bms_textures_dir.vpk (Not any of the other textures vpk files - the format is designed so that anything stored in those is opened via the _dir)</p>
<p>Most of the posters are under decals/papers. You’ll probably have to settle for just using them as a reference in a photo editing or illustration software though, since they’re pretty low resolution compared to print-quality stuff.</p>
<p>That’s the <span class="bbcode-i">how</span>, anyway. Not sure about the legal stuff but if it’s for personal use I doubt the devs would mind.</p>

            <p>i am not sure about retail legal stuff but i belive as long as you aren’t profiting off there work with the mods assets its allowed look at the license your self though the posters are easiest to find by starting up  the hammer editor and finding the source map files under bms/mapsrc then finding the decals and selecting them to find the sign name</p>
