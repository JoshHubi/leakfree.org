            <p>i watched a Documentary last night. İ heard they perfected a spaceship.That could reach Alpha Centauri (nearest Star System). But the problem is They need negative energy (As i remember) as big as Saturn. And we can only create negative energy size of a microbe (again as i remember). İf They could solve this problem we could go faster than light speed. But the man said. They probably won’t be able to do it in this half-century.</p>

<p>Um.  You can’t get BEYOND it because there’s no such thing as “beyond the universe”.  It is a gibberish concept in the same vein as “before the Big Bang”.</p>
<p>Time for some mind blowing stuff:</p>
<p>The universe is all that exists.  If there was a “beyond”, then that would be part of the universe, too.  The universe is finite in size, but has no boundaries.  You can’t really get to the edge, technically speaking, because there isn’t any edge.  “Edge” is a byproduct of Euclidean geometry and only works in math books.</p>
<p>In Euclidean geometry, the sum of a closed triangle’s angles equal 180 degrees.  A right triangle is defined as a triangle with one right angle and two acute angles.  It works perfectly…on paper.  However, once you get into reality, things get a touch different.</p>
<p>It is quite easily possible for a right triangle in reality to have TWO right angles with the sum of their angles equal to greater than 180 degrees.  How?  Place a point on the North Pole of the Earth and call it point A.  Place a point on two points on the equator of the Earth and call it points B and C.  Draw line segments between these three points.  The measurement of angle ABC is 90 degrees.  The measurement of angle ACB is 90 degrees.  A closed triangle with two 90 degree angles.</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f4086c3679e9de8eeb89059690e5127459ca9b40.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="yOOxZSdPo31FQoMZGuQTxD3Wtva" width="160" height="120"></p>
<p>The surface of the Earth is curved, allowing for this to occur.  It is non-Euclidean.  You can travel in a straight line to the west forever around the globe and never get to the end because there is no end.  You’ll just keep going around the globe into infinity.</p>
<p>Spacetime, also, is curved like this.  You can travel forever in a straight line and never get to the end of the universe.  You’ll just end up going around the universe over and over again like going around the Earth over and over again. And the space between objects in this finite but boundaryless universe is growing (currently).</p>
<p>This is Stephen Hawking’s and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WL_vtu4r1w" data-bbcode="true">Carl Sagan</a>’s position on this matter as well.</p>
<p>Yes, Mindfuck Central, I know.  Causes you to possibly pull this face: :fffuuu:</p>
<p>But that’s the current working theory in our VASTLY ignorant understanding of the universe as it now stands.   Could we be wrong?  I most certainly don’t doubt that we are wrong, but that’s what the information we have available to us is currently taking us.  Into Mindfuck Central.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s not crazy and it seemed reasonable at a point in history untill Edwin Hubble proved with the shifting of galaxies that the universe is expanding. This rules out the theory that the universe ‘always existed’ because a universe wouldn’t just “be there” and then suddenly out of nothing start to grow at speeds beyond your imagination (dark energy is causing this).</p>
<p>Also, the existence of matter in our universe (planets, stars etc.) is not eternal. At one point in time the universe will almost be completely empty and the spacetime dimensions will have grown so large you might aswell call it infinite - this is so far ahead in the future though it’s just not possible to comprehend (talking about quadrillions of years here).</p>

<p>This actually makes me wonder. It’s sure as hell life out there, but intelligent life? What if there is? What if they have more advanced telescopes than us, and are maybe looking at us?</p>
