    <title>Minesweeper (it&#39;s in Dutch)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/minesweeper-its-in-dutch/12135</link>
    <description>I made minesweeper for school in 2009. I never got around to actually deploying it, but I stumbled across it today so now I have.

It&#39;s fairly basic, but it works well and I just felt like sharing it :p

You can download it [url=schizosplayground.com/pers/Minesweeper.zip]here[/url]. It&#39;s about 14MB.

Edit: I know no-one cares, but I translated it to English because I was bored.</description>
