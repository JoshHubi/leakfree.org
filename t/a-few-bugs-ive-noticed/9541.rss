1. The HUD post-process seems to cause a good amount of lag for me
1. when breaking crates, the gibs seem to sometimes be part way through the floor, thus causing some weird physics interactions
1. performance seems to generically be bad (spent a good amount of time in the settings in the first two or three chapters where as in other source games I can just max out most of the settings and be done with it)
1. don&#39;t know if this is a Source issue or not, but demo recording seems to add to the performance problem


Aside from the bugs (I feel I am forgetting a few, but oh well), this mod is GREAT. Amazing how even though I have recently played through the original Half-Life, this mod has made me jump a few times (yes, I am easily scared)! I was worried that this mod wouldn&#39;t live up to what I was expecting, but it has actually surpassed what I was hoping it would be.</description>

            <p>Yah, got to the trash compactor earlier today, and it is awesome except for the boards that phase through the crushers. I know that there probably isn’t a way to fix that (I remember trying to make a map in the portal 2 sdk that at one point would fling a bunch of cubes at you, but the panels kept phasing through the cubes instead of throwing them), but hopefully there is a fix for them spawning part way through the floor.</p>

            <p>I’ve got a screen shot of problem no. 2, where some content of a crate has passed through a metal grill (in chapter blast pit, just after returning from turning on the oxygen and fuel)</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, this is a fantastic game!!! Good job!!!<img src="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=96144431&amp;insideModal=1" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Edit: Why doesn’t the image show? Here’s a link, I hope that works! <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=96144431&amp;insideModal=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=96144431&amp;insideModal=1</a></p>

<p>Number 1 isn’t a bug: it’s an optional feature you should disable if your system can’t handle it.</p>

<p>Well, I figure I should mention it in case there is something they can do to optimize it. I have just been having such a performance problem with Black Mesa, which I find weird considering that I can max out most of the settings in other source games and be just fine.</p>
