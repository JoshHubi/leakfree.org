    <title>Bluetooth Headsets</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bluetooth-headsets/6269</link>
    <description>So since the raids on P-platers have grown to new heights in Australia and the chances of getting picked up for being on your phone (not to mention driving drunk or speeding) are huge, my parents have been &#39;encouraging&#39; me to get a Bluetooth headset for my iPhone. I don&#39;t think the brand matters, but let me know if it does.

Anyway, since I have to buy this monstrosity, I was wondering if anyone here had any experience with cheap Bluetooth headsets; i.e., the ones that sit in your ear. My friend has a $130 one and says its great, but it is, well, $130. I saw a couple for $AUD30, and was wondering if its worth going with the cheap option, or whether I should shell out a little more and go with a $50 or $60 one, just because the cheaper ones are too crap to use.

I&#39;m going to get check out an electronics store tomorrow so I&#39;ll have a better idea of what I&#39;m dealing with then, but we&#39;ll see what happens.</description>

            <p>look for</p>
<p>A2DP Compliant</p>
<p>the ones before that have even shittier sound quality than the phone line</p>
<p>also make sure you have at least FW4.1 on your iPhone (yes before 4.1 bluetooth support was practically nonexistent so if your iphone is jailbroken/unlocked forget about it)</p>

<p>I have 4 lying around, they all sound like crap, I put a 3.5mm jack out of one of them so I can use headphones because hearing sound in one ear really annoys me.</p>
