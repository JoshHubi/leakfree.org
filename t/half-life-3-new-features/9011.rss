    <title>Half-Life 3 new features?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-3-new-features/9011</link>
    <description>When Half-Life 3 (eventually) releases what features do you expect from the engine? I think there will be destructible environments, greatly improved AI both hostile and friendly, maybe the ability to mutilate ala Left 4 Dead (not too sure on this one as I don&#39;t think  it really suits Half-Life) and Greatly improved Lighting, with god rays and realistic shadows.

on another note, I don&#39;t think the Portal Gun will make an Appearance in Half-Life 3.</description>

<p>Yeah sadly I’m a bit addicted to it, like saving everytime i kill an enemy :fffuuu:. That would also increase the difficulty, because the player is relentless knowing that he can quick load 10 seconds earlier to prevent a catastrophe, instead of playing safe and smart.</p>

            <p>Better animations when you shoot people, like if they weren’t insta killed when the bullets touch them. They’re still alive for a few seconds, so they should fall like a person and not like a big bag full of potatoes.</p>

            <p>I’d like to see what HL games have been for a while. A kind small technology demonstrator, where said technology serves gameplay in some way, so that the game would be tailored around this new technology, making it fit seamlessly. Say for example, the gravity gun in HL2, HDR in EP1 and big open maps in EP2. These were not intrusive to gameplay and in fact, gave each game their own unique feel, while not diverging from the overall feeling of the series.</p>
<p>Think about it. The gravity gun gave you a new way of engaging enemies cheaply, while demonstrating Havok physics constructively. The HDR was used to give C17 a all around feeling of destruction by using contrasting light tones in different areas. The open maps were, essentially, a way of giving the world outside of the city a more free feeling, further cementing the idea that the combine are just trying to control everything and failing badly.</p>

            <p>I just want it to support the latest graphics features even though it’s most likely not going to be aiming for looking like Crysis 3. DX11 or the latest OpenGL with tessellation and relatively good graphics are fine with me. I want the AI to be fucking insane though. And for it to not feel like you’re cramped in a small area which even Ep2’s open levels felt kind of closed and small. And that it doesn’t load every 10 minutes, that’s my biggest hope.</p>

            <p>Here’s a crazy theory. Valve releases HL3. Everyone’s like, what is this shiz? What has this got to do with the end of EP2? How does it fit in? What? I don’t even? Great game, no Borealis. Alyx made some snide remarks about it though. And I could swear that scientist said “sorry for your loss” to Alyx. But how am I here? Where is this coming from? What was GMan on about?</p>
<p>Many emails are sent to Valve and Gabe, with a multitude of cryptic answers in return.</p>
<p>Until, one day, not too long from the release of HL3, Valve sneakily releases EP3, with no fanfare. With the Borealis, helicopter stint and everything, hidden in the backwaters of the Steam catalogue. It comes to the world’s attention within a couple of hours, and everyone feels like fools. Now everything fits in. Everything makes sense. The world can sleep at night.</p>
<p>Don’t expect Valve to be all consecutive about this.</p>
<p>Also, isn’t everyone travelling forwards in time? Also, does anyone remember this from Portal 2? <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/1/6/163b29961ff4b62c7a4175948c634c12116e5795.jpeg" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/163b29961ff4b62c7a4175948c634c12116e5795" title=""><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/1/6/163b29961ff4b62c7a4175948c634c12116e5795.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="3aFg4Ml7xWrgheLQCHe3V9V21uJ" width="453" height="500" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/1/6/163b29961ff4b62c7a4175948c634c12116e5795_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">851×939 68.8 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div> (oh, of course, danielsangeo)</p>

            <p>Time-traveling to the past is still more believable IMO than to go to a future, AS managed the latter 0_o</p>
<p>So “true” time-travel is obviously possible within the Portal/Half-life universe, actually an ending about going back in time to prevent the events of HL1 from ever happening sounds interesting.</p>

<p>I for one am beginning to hope (and believe) that there’s going to be a time skip between HL2E2 and HL3 comparable to the one between HL1 and HL2.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t think this will be the case. At the end of HL1 you stepped into a portal and were subjected to the Gman’s time manipulation or whatever so it made sense with the time traveling. This time though the game ends with Alyx crying over her father’s corpse. There’s no hint of really anything happening like in HL1, so I think it’ll pick up either directly after or just a few hours after HL2E2. I can see what SINM said happening though. There was that one adviser, but he’s right, it would be weird to just have that one, or two. So yeah, either fighting or avoiding the advisers at the beginning of the game while trying to find a safe place to hole up and prepare to leave for the arctic makes sense.</p>

            <p>Hmm, good post, and I see your point. But I still think there’s an important distinction between travelling forwards and backwards in time, and IMO the latter would be quite hard to fit in a consistent and satisfying way, story-wise.</p>

            <p>I think of time travel of this sort (into the future) as something that interferes with the otherwise normal passage of time for the person perceiving it.</p>
<p>In Back to the Future, the time machine goes from 1955 to 1985 to 2015 (to the late 1800s–I cba’d to find out the exact year-- and then back to 1985 again).  In these cases, the occupants of the time machine do not perceive that passage of 30 years or whatever.  They experience it as a brief flash of light and a sonic crash, but for them, 30 years is but a half a second.</p>
<p>For the Half-Life universe, from Gordon’s perspective, he defeats the Nihilanth and is transported to various locations (maybe) by the G-man, ending up on the tram (maybe) where he gives Gordon the ultimatum.  Gordon (assuming you take the former option) steps into the portal and, the next thing he knows, the G-man is telling Gordon that he doesn’t mean to imply that Gordon’s been sleeping on the job and then to wake up and smell the ashes.</p>
<p>Then Gordon and Alyx get teleported back from the Citadel to Kleiner’s lab and it took a bit of time from their perspective but they appeared in Kleiner’s lab a long time after they should’ve appeared.</p>
<p>And, over in Aperture, Chell destroys the personality cores, “murdering” GLaDOS, ending up outside, but is (now) dragged back into the facility.  She blacks out and then wakes up in the motel room née storage crate some who-knows-how-long later.</p>
<p>These are all time travel, in my opinion, because the normal flow of time for the person(s) is disrupted.  (Sleep doesn’t count because the normal flow of time continues for the person even if they’re asleep.)  Chell was technically in stasis so she wasn’t “asleep”, in my view.</p>
<p>And then the sideways references in old Aperture to time travel tells me that Valve is not adverse to the concept.</p>

<p>It is still time travel. Probably just worked as a 4th dimensional wormhole of sorts. Besides, I’m pretty sure science said that traveling back in time is impossible (or it happens in black holes, but fuck that).<br>
Also the G-Man has pretty much demonstrated a very ample variety of skills such as stopping time, showing you glimpses of the past and the future and also a form of teleportation. So he probably has skills that affect other dimensions as well. Makes you wonder how he really looks like.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Only time travel in the most basic sense, such that we’re <span class="bbcode-i">all</span> time travelling. I don’t think it’s an indicator of any other forms of time travel appearing in the series. Like I said, it’s more along the lines of cryostasis.</p>
<p>Also, I think the G-Man’s skills are more to do with perception than the physical manipulation of dimensions - he doesn’t literally stop time, but changes Gordon’s perception of it, and the glimpses of the various places that he gives Gordon are dream-like manipulations of his senses. This would be a lot more efficient than actually taking him to those places, and the G-Man seems like an efficient guy.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><span class="bbcode-i">My </span>theory (I’ve mentioned before) is that there’s no way we’re going right to the Arctic. The <span class="bbcode-i">advisers themselves</span> are at White Forest at the end of EP2, and I’d bet anything that they brought some more backup- probably all they could get. So there will be some fighting at WF. My guess is that Gordon will wake up a minute later, maybe in another room. Barney, Alyx, Kliner, and Magnusson  are there. Everyone’s preparing to leave; the plan is to meet up at a small rebel base further up north we haven’t seen yet. A short conversation will take place about that, and Barney + the doctors will separate from you and Alyx. The northern base will be what Black Mesa East was to HL2, but the trip will be shorter.</p>
<p>Anyone who expects HL3 to get to the Arctic quickly is mistaken. At least the first two or three chapters will involve getting away from WF to a safer location. <span class="bbcode-i">Then</span> they will journey to the Arctic and see the Borealis. I can only hope HL3 will be a long game. The majority of the game can’t be the journey to the arctic, but the journey can’t be really short. It should take an hour, maybe.</p>
<p>Once we get to the Borealis, who knows what. That’s the event horizon when it comes to predictions. We just don’t know enough- maybe Valve still doesn’t know themselves (I hope they do)! Maybe we’ll get a third new innovative weapon from the Borealis alongside the unknown powerful AS technology. It <span class="bbcode-i">won’t</span> be the ASHPD; Aperture must have made more than one kind of handheld device in their <span class="bbcode-i">gigantic</span> underground facility.</p>
<p>All the theories I see about HL3 are so quick to jump right to Arctic territory. Why? Consider all the time in HL you spend just getting from place to place. We’ll see such travel in HL3, and some important things are bound to happen along the way.</p>
<p>As for things like the Combine homeworld, I’m hesitant to say it’s going to happen in HL3- maybe we’ll get there, but sneaking around the homeworld of a huge evil multidimensional empire with whole planets full of resources and advanced technology stolen from who-knows-how-many races is a bit harder than infiltrating just one Citadel.</p>
<p>Maybe at the end of the game Gordon can steal a gigantic can of alien insecticide to get rid of the Xen wildlife on Earth. It would be huge and oversized, like the <a href="https://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120621214430/half-life/en/images/8/89/Underground_oldportalgun.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ASPQTD</a>, and would hold way more on the inside than outside due to Secret Combine Space Warping Janitorial Technology (SCSWJT). That will be the last chapter: at the end we get to go around effortlessly cleaning up the head-crabs, antlions, etc. Left click to spray, right click to squirt. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>And no, the only thing worse than traveling back in time and stopping the resonance cascade would be that the G-Man is gordans father or gordans future self. By far the stupidest noob theories.</p>
