    <title>EVO 4G HALP</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/evo-4g-halp/6328</link>
    <description>K so the other week, i dropped by the Sprint store and decided to pick up an EVO 4G, considering i&#39;ve heard such good things about it, and lemme say.

The phone&#39;s pretty epic.

Anyways, one feature that comes with the phone (email) is giving me a bit of a hassle.

For some reason, I can recieve emails on my yahoo account a-ok, but for some reason, when i try and send emails, they don&#39;&#39;t send, and the phone doesn&#39;t stop trying to send the email until i delete it. 

Any ideas?</description>

            <p>if at all possible switch to g-mail as it has MS exchange. Exchange is very powerful as it has live 2 way e-mail sync as well as integrated 2-way calender sync.</p>
<p>As for yahoo, you are correct that you have to pay for yahoo plus to unlock the “advanced” features.</p>

            <p>Ok Jim, i’m trying to follow your advice, but i’m a bit stuck.</p>
<p>I had the protocol on IMAP, so i changed it to POP, but it won’t let me, saying that my server isn’t responding.</p>
<p>also, i can’t find where to change the incoming/outgoing ports and SMTP Server…</p>
<p>Edit Figured it out, for whatever reason, my EVO decided to add ‘android’ at the beginning of the server name.</p>
<p>I’ll keep you guys posted if things go wrong.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Further investigation shows that in order to get it up an d running smoothly, I would need to upgrade to yahoo mail plus, which is stupid. I guess i can work with the yahoo mail app <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

            <p>i hate when people word something so simple in so many words</p>
<p>I’ve had to listen to almost every way of saying “can send but can’t receive email”</p>
<p>anyway I suggest you call customer support and have them fix the address</p>
