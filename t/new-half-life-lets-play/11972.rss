            <p>The problem I have with these is that there’s too many of them. Shortly after release most of the threads being created were Let’s Plays, most with annoying commentary. Or half the time they won’t be playing the actual game, just dicking around putting trashbins on scientists heads to make it more “entertaining” for their viewers.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I like to watch other people with a different perspective play a game and talk about it, same reason I like watching my friends playing some games.</p>
<p>They definitely aren’t a large thing for me, there’s like only a handful of people I would actually bother watching play through a game on youtube.</p>

            <p>I still don’t see the point of "Let’s Play"s. You could just play the game yourself instead of watching someone else play it.</p>
<p>I guess if your computer can’t handle it, or if you want to have a preview, but in the latter case a short video would be more than sufficient.</p>
<p>Ah well…</p>

            <p>You don’t need to spam your Let’s Plays all over the forums, one thread is enough.</p>
