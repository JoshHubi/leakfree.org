            <p>I’ve tried reapplying the workgroup, which is basically the same thing. I don’t see how I can reset the network settings other than changing them and then changing them back, or something.</p>

            <p>It’s fucking shit isn’t it. It hasn’t been working for a few days now though. The options are all correct, and I disabled the firewall (I only the Windows one). Still no luck. I’ll try changing the workgroup name.</p>
<p>I raged so much a few days ago that I punched my XP monitor. Now there’s a big white line on it.</p>

            <p>Mine does this all the time. Works one day, doesn’t the next.<br>
Check your W7 sharing options, sisable passworded sharing, try change the name of the workgroup, chack your firewall (And the windows firewall. I found the W7 has a secondary firewall of sorts that doesn’t disable when you disable the firewall &gt;_&gt;)</p>
