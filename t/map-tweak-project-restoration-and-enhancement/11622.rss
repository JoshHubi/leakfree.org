    <title>Map Tweak Project - restoration and enhancement</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/map-tweak-project-restoration-and-enhancement/11622</link>
    <description>This is a small project because I simply do not have time to do massive projects but I still want to contribute some things to either improve or enhance Black Mesa where possible.

My Goals are quite simple and are as follows.

1. Restore moved scene to original location in C3a2b Alien Grunt Forcing Doors open of main hallway - Status = [b]Done version 1.0[/b]

[url]https://www.mediafire.com/?jslp2l4jrfxcq7d[/url]

[u]Replace map in BMS / maps from the file updated the original is also included to erase the update
[/u]
2. Restore the spinning fan blade in office complex vent to chop up headcrabs / move the scene of the zombie behind the door also to this area due to map layout alterations - Status = Not started

3. Improve the transition effects of the teleport orbs in Lambda core this will only be a test map example. Status = Started not tested

4. Improve the Headcrab digging it&#39;s way to the surface by adding a dust effect to the action test map example Status = Not started

5. Improve teleportation effects in Anomalous Materials Test Chamber whole map if possible and add missing teleport to the bullsquid Status = Not Started

6. Improve teleport sequence on to xen adding a wormwhole / vortex before credits / xen. Status = Not Started

7. Lock The door in QE before the laser puzzle so you cannot load back to the last level - Add fire damge if you try to go through the molten hole too early. And fix the trigger so you actally see the scripted sequence of the scientist blowing himself up with the tau cannon if it&#39;s included? Status = Not Started

It&#39;s a small project like I said but hope to get through it reasonably quick.. But quite busy with work at the moment and do not want to take on the responsibility of a massive project

Anyway These are my project goals but also would like to welcome other map tweaks and examples from others of trying to enhance or restore either whole maps or test rooms. But please [b][u]no maps with loads of enemies or weapons placed in the map i.e Shoot fest [/u][/b] claiming to be an enhancement or an improvement unless it is valid as an example and not detracting from what the game is... This is very important and I hope this is clear on the idea for this project.

This first post will be updated with download links and videos or images but for now I keep this a simple link on my first submission off the list

Any suggestions for small tweaks to be done mapping wise are also welcome and anyone who wants to strike any of these off the list by contributing is also welcome this is not a definitive list</description>

            <p>Idea. Why don’t you just make the maps like HL’s?<br>
Examples:<br>
In BM, it was larger and has 3 working stations where one of those bridges are broken by the apache’s rpg.<br>
To make it like HL, you can keep the size but the other two stations must be somehow bombed or destroyed.  A turret must be near the bridge where it was destroyed by a satchel after a vortigaunt chases it killing both the marine and the vortigaunt.</p>

            <p>I Have been very Busy working had a computer failure and now just moved house.</p>
<p>I Have it in mind to return to this over the Easter break and will do some work on it then.</p>
<p>Right now I do not have Black Mesa installed but I will by the Easter and get back on it then. It was never a big List anyway and will do what I can over this time period</p>

<p>What good is it to fix this for myself?  The point is to get it into Steam integration so the fix and extra polish to BMS can be appreciated by all.  The truth of the matter is that I really don’t care what your opinion is and I’m not writing to the general forum poster.  I’m making these points for the devs to see because they can actually do something about it if they choose to.  If not, then that’s their perogative…but it’s not yours.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you took your own advice, you could have designed BMS from the ground up with all of the time you devoted to posting.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well I didn’t notice it at all, but if u want to fix them, so go ahead, good to have somebody who looks at details.</p>
<p>U say it would only for u, not true, u just can release it here in Sector C, just alter it, and upload the complete map</p>

<p>Actually, I could go for some additional cover on the left-hand side of the room in front of the door you come out of. It’d help big time (at least in my case). Getting over to the boxes on the other side can be infuriating in some cases, 'specially with the HECU shooting at you the entire way.</p>

<p>Thanks for the heads up.  This dude actually made some offensive comment to me in a previous post which I ignored so I decided to respond this time.  I’ll be sure to report if this continues to be a problem.  Also, I’m not interested in arguing with people on forums.  The only reason why I’m here is to help Text finish his ST revisions and improve BMS.  Once that’s done, I’m out permanently.</p>
<p>Nice to have a dev actually get back to me.  I looked this up previously as well and my point still stands.  Xenos is not an English word…it’s a Greek word (really an ancient version that may not even be in use).  The closest thing in English it would resemble is a word-root.  An example is “acro.”  This is not a real word but can form real words when prefixed, such as “acrobat” or “acromegaly.”  Similarly “xenos” is not a real word but can be combined to make “xenofauna,” which is what you’re trying to describe anyway (snarks).</p>
<p>The reason why I made such a stink about the grammar and design layout in QE is that it’s the ONLY chapter in BMS that has these issues.  If you guys are serious about fixing this, I’d be glad to help you find all the errors.  I have an extensive background in science and can help you with the proper phrasing.

<p>No I thought the way this was done was an improvement upon the original and think it should stay this way in Black Mesa… I have no intention to alter this</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/wangman">@wangman</a> Please don’t be angry sersoft has just re-iterated what I have just said earlier but in a different way… To change the signs requires  zero mapping work it’s a texture swap only and can be easily implemented… However I will try to update the laser puzzle area with the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The door locks behind you just after you load in the area at the top of the stairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding a trigger hurt while the wall is still melting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing the trigger for the squence where the scientists blows himself up with the tau cannon. I am actually unsure if this is a scripted sequence poorly triggered or an audio trick… I will find out later and if it’s a trick I will do a sequence for it otherwise I will move the trigger or create a second trigger if it’s a timed sequence</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anything to do with textures or signs needs to be posted in the test chamber but noted points you made that I feel are relevant.</p>
<p>the main battle at the end of QE will work fine with an AI config script tweak for hard mode so no mapping required on this fine the way it is in terms of the map it’self</p>
<p>Please can we keep this thread constructive <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>What good is it to fix this for myself?  The point is to get it into Steam integration so the fix and extra polish to BMS can be appreciated by all.  The truth of the matter is that I really don’t care what your opinion is and I’m not writing to the general forum poster.  I’m making these points for the devs to see because they can actually do something about it if they choose to.  If not, then that’s their perogative…but it’s not yours.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you took your own advice, you could have designed BMS from the ground up with all of the time you devoted to posting.</p>

<p>Really?  You didn’t read all the chalkboards on alien anatomy in QE, or the signs in AM, or the “Fire” buttons scattered throughout the game?  What surprises me is that the organic chemistry, anatomy &amp; physiology, and physics on those boards are legit.  Why were the signs so messed up?</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Wang</span> I understand your desire to defend yourself, but it would’ve been better to just ignore him/her/it.

<p>Thanks for the heads up.  This dude actually made some offensive comment to me in a previous post which I ignored so I decided to respond this time.  I’ll be sure to report if this continues to be a problem.  Also, I’m not interested in arguing with people on forums.  The only reason why I’m here is to help Text finish his ST revisions and improve BMS.  Once that’s done, I’m out permanently.</p>

</aside>
<p>Nice to have a dev actually get back to me.  I looked this up previously as well and my point still stands.  Xenos is not an English word…it’s a Greek word (really an ancient version that may not even be in use).  The closest thing in English it would resemble is a word-root.  An example is “acro.”  This is not a real word but can form real words when prefixed, such as “acrobat” or “acromegaly.”  Similarly “xenos” is not a real word but can be combined to make “xenofauna,” which is what you’re trying to describe anyway (snarks).</p>
<p>The reason why I made such a stink about the grammar and design layout in QE is that it’s the ONLY chapter in BMS that has these issues.  If you guys are serious about fixing this, I’d be glad to help you find all the errors.  I have an extensive background in science and can help you with the proper phrasing.  I also compiled a list of reasonable balance, AI and level design fixes that I sent to some of the dev team.  I can also send you a copy if you haven’t seen it.</p>
