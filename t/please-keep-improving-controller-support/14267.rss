    <title>Please keep improving controller support</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/please-keep-improving-controller-support/14267</link>
    <description>In steam release 0.1.0 of black mesa, I notice that I can now go into keyboard settings, and edit my controller bindings directly there.

This is nice and thank you for this. However, would be much nicer to have controller [b]keys mapping to be a separate menu section.[/b]

Also, in the menu navigation, controller works only when first starting black mesa. Menu navigation does not work using a controller after loading a level.

Please realize that many PC gamers actually prefer to use a controller with all their games.

I personally use xbox360 controller for windows. Steam controller is also coming out soon.

Please keep improving controller support for black mesa.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>While playing BM chapter missions, after being idle for a few minutes, xbox360 wireless controller automatically turns off. It is a built in function to save battery.</p>
<p>When this happens, black mesa resets my custom controller keys that I have specified in keyboard settings.</p>
<p>Will the future release of controller support and GUI include a fix to prevent controller keys from resetting?</p>
