<p>Not good, since its so soon I’d think they’d at least have the decency to send it to earlier sign ups first.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, they look for the results and then send it to them. I see many on the facepunch forum that have signed up on the first day and still didn’t get their key.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can tell apart American voices, its just it gets bland.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s probably because you grew up with english. I can’t tell the spoken different between sheep/cheap but I can pronounce them correctly. It’s just when people talking about it, I’ll have to use the context to pick which one.</p>
<p>Most swedes, Including me, can’t pronounce Jason. One of my friends spent last summer in America with his band and they hanged out with someone named Jason and his friends. The kept commenting that my friend pronounced Jason as Yason.<br>
This reminds me of the skyrimwiki page for Mjoll the Lioness where it says something similiar to “Although her name is pronounced Me-joll some characters ingame pronounce her name as Me-yoll.” What’s the different?</p>
<p>How this I turn this thread in this direction? I should probably stop now, I don’t want it to become too off topic.</p>
