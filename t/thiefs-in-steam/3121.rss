    <title>Thiefs in Steam</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/thiefs-in-steam/3121</link>
    <description>I got a message from stranger. He give me this link and said, that Nvidia give me three free games. I click on that link. [url][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]link removed[/url]

All looks like steam community page, except that sentence:
[i][COLOR=&#39;YellowGreen&#39;]Nvidia Gives you 3 STEAM GAMES FOR FREE
You need only login and select 3 any games.
Good gaming by NVIDIA![/i]

I was thinking about one thing - [b]they want to steal my account[/b], but i wasn&#39;t sure. So, I create new account (without any games) and I &quot;log in&quot;.
What happened? I click log in key and [b]NOTHING HAPENNED[/b]. I was again on that page.
What to do when you get that message? 
[b][u][COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]NOTHING!!! DO NOT TELL THEM YOUR PASSWORD!!![/u][/b]

P.S.
I am not dumb, and I&#39;ll never tell my password to anyone  :smiley: 

[COLOR=&#39;red&#39;]CatzEyes93: I removed the link to prevent idiots from clicking to see what you are talking about.</description>

            <p>I fell for this last month. Not the 3 games per say,  but something similar. was a pain to recover, but nothing unreasonable.  This actually made me slightly more productive than usual, what with not being able to log on to steam.</p>

            <p>I got the same message, but it was not to do with NVidia, it just linked me to some romanian site, and said that I had as many free games as I wanted, I did not click on on it, but ti was something like freesteamsgames.storepowered.co.ro or something like that. That is not an actual link, also, it completely mirrored steam apart from a sentence.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I got a message from stranger. He give me this link and said, that Nvidia give me three free games. I click on that link. [COLOR=‘Red’]link removed</p>
<p>All looks like steam community page, except that sentence:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">[COLOR=‘YellowGreen’]Nvidia Gives you 3 STEAM GAMES FOR FREE<br>
You need only login and select 3 any games.<br>
Good gaming by NVIDIA!</span></p>
<p>I was thinking about one thing - <span class="bbcode-b">they want to steal my account</span>, but i wasn’t sure. So, I create new account (without any games) and I “log in”.<br>
What happened? I click log in key and <span class="bbcode-b">NOTHING HAPENNED</span>. I was again on that page.<br>
What to do when you get that message?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">[COLOR=‘Red’]NOTHING!!! DO NOT TELL THEM YOUR PASSWORD!!!</span></span></p>
<p>P.S.<br>
I am not dumb, and I’ll never tell my password to anyone  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>[COLOR=‘red’]CatzEyes93: I removed the link to prevent idiots from clicking to see what you are talking about.</p>
