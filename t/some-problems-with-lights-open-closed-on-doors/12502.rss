    <title>Some problems with lights (open/closed) on doors</title>

    <description>Hi,

Some problems with lights that show if the door is closed or open...

[b]First one:[/b]

Where those scientist comes banging on the window and those security agent is grabbed, in those room. (those with a Health and power recharge station in front of it)

The room with those big closing doors, where u need to break the glass.

So when u finally hit this room, there is a scientist in it, when u look to the door u just came through, it stays on green, but cannot be opened, so this color has to be changed to red.

-----------------------------------------

[b]Second one:[/b]

In blast pit, u need to turn the knows so the red becomes green and the doors open, but on some of them, u can turn them, even if they stay red and the door stays locked (gameplay wise).

I think it&#39;s better u cannot turn them at all or something</description>
