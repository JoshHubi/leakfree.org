    <description>i was thinking i should get dual graphics for my new PC, to all you tech guys out here. would one graphics card work on quality, while the other performance? 
what CPU should i get?
what is an appropriate amount of RAM for a casual gamer?</description>

            <p>I’ve used Nvidia SLI for a long time now. SLI can cause some problems, like lighting effects can be distorted or other little things. These can usually be fixed by temporarily disabling SLI (but who really wants to do that?). I don’t know enough about ATI to voice an opinion, but the stats they put out are usually very comparable if not better.</p>
<p>proccessor, i7 or i5. i7 if you’re running sli or crossfire, since the i5 does something strange with the performance of a 2nd graphic card (the i3 does it too). I can’t remember the specific reason, but i5’s limit the use of a 2nd card.</p>

            <p>It really depends on what you want to do with it and what type of monitor you are using. I use a fair amount of GPU accelerated software, some of it CUDA only so my main machine will always have an nvidia card it in. I am currently running a GTX480 and a GT 240 to run my second and third monitors. However, it is hot, loud and was expensive. My second machine has an HD 5850 in it with a Core 2 Quad. Crysis is the only FPS that gives it trouble pushing frames at 1920x1200 resolution and only on one level at that. Then there are other issues. As a cartographer (among other geographic endeavors), color (saturation, sharpless etc) and contrast is very important and ATI(AMD) consumer cards continue to blow away anything nvidia offers in that regard. Unless you have a full resolution monitor (1920x1200) or higher, there is no need for a dual card setup unless you care about framerate beyond what the human eye can differentiate. If that is the case good luck.</p>

            <p>Its not just about graphics cards, CPU and RAM. You need to take into consideration your power supply, how much amperage on the 12v rails it produces, what wattage it produces, the brand name, etc. You also need a case to fit a modern graphics card (which get longer and longer), a motherboard compatible with the type of processor you want, good cooling in the case, etc.</p>

            <p>4Gb of ram is enough for the casual gamer, but as for crossfire and sli, I’ve not run it, so I wouldn’t know. The average gamer should be able to make do with an i5 or a Phenom II x4 900-and-something</p>
<p>It’s all very rough. DO you have a budget or any targets for us to go off of?</p>
