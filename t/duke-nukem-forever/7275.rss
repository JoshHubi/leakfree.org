    <description>Alas! The game is but just over a week away, and the demo has been released for the First Access Club members who bought the Borderlands GOTY before October 12 (I believe), Borderlands on Steam before then, or preordered DNF.

Currently downloading it now, we&#39;ll see how it is. Post your thoughts.</description>

            <p>I’ve been playing it, I take it back. The Singleplayer sucks ass. I’ve almost beat it, and I don’t even want to play anymore.</p>
<p>Now the Multiplayer however, has exceeded my expectations, and is great. It’s almost worth it to get the game just for the Multiplayer - except since this game’s main focus was SP, it’d probably be best to wait for it to drop in price or go on sale.</p>
<p>The MP is so much like old school shooters, and there’s so much less limiting things about it, compared to the SP.</p>

<p>It’s not about reviews, it’s about sales, and as far as I know, DNF is selling well. No suprise. Even if critics say the game is bad, people do buy it if not for Duke, than because of the boobs.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Been playing it for a while, so far its not bad. Now, while I do like the game, the first couple of levels after the initial start are <span class="bbcode-i">absolute trash</span>. I’m not exaggerating. After playing them I understood the bad reviews as I wanted to put the game down, and walk away, and the puzzles were so obvious it was like it was for kiddies. Some parts I almost wanted to burn the game it was that bad.</p>
<p>However, as I got to the Hive and Duke Burger, the game got <span class="bbcode-b">loads</span> more fun, and the level design was actually good and creative. Haven’t beaten it yet, but I’m actually enjoying it so far. What I can’t understand for the life of me is how <span class="bbcode-b">3d realms messed up the first segment of the game so horrendously bad, or how gearbox didn’t notice.</span> It was like a kid designed them, not how they looked, but the way they played, or didn’t play is the more correct term. Now all of a sudden its like, “oh hey guys let me turn the <span class="bbcode-i">quality</span> switch on. There, now we know how to make a level.”</p>
<p>I think it deserves the low scores. It doesn’t matter if the rest turns out to be amazing, because NOTHING CAN MAKE ME FORGET HOW BAD THE BEGINNING WAS. It’s like if I lodge a fork in your eyeball, and then give you a thousand dollars. You’ll like the thousand, but that doesn’t change the fact that I <span class="bbcode-b">JUST FUCKING BLINDED YOU IN ONE EYE.</span></p>
<p>Now the multiplayer, on the other hand is fun as fuck. It’s a throwback to games like HL and Quake, and UT, and it’s done right. It’s like Duke3D multiplayer evolved for now. Instead of focusing on unlocks, it focuses on the gameplay, and your unlocks are interactive items for your apartment like air hockey,pinball, pool, etc. and customizing your looks. That’s the kind of thing I was hoping to see from certain games, especially that AvP game (which would have benefited greatly from that, choosing 1 model is just stupid in that kind of game)</p>
<p>I love planting tripmines on people, and shrinking em too.</p>

            <p>I thought DNF was very good! I think it could have been better though, I hated the two weapon limit, and the game itself should have been a little closer to DN3D, but still good non the less!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>One thing I’m really getting annoyed at in DNF is the overabundance of Duke Nukem memorabilia lying about, I realize the dude saved the world three or quite possibly four times, but there shouldn’t be THAT much Duke Nukem crap lying about the game world. For instance: in the Duke Burger level, there are jars of condiments with Duke Nukem’s face on them. I realize He’s supposed to be a God-level celebrity in his reality and all, but seeing Duke’s face EVERYWHERE I TURN is overkill.</p>

            <p>lol. that was amusing. honestly though, I only look at reviews for a general idea.  The general idea I got about duke nukem forever was that it sucked.  so I’m probably not even gonna pirate this one. have enough games to finish already.</p>
<p>thought the PR in the article should definitely be fired.</p>

            <p>It was a relatively fun game. The car controls were a bit of a pain to muster, but otherwise worked ok. The big letdown for me was the lack of the more mature type content that appeared in the trailers and after in many game-play footage. The Strip club was the biggest let-down for me. Overall, the game was relatively fun, but not worth the $50 price tag. $20 yes, but $50 is pushing it quite badly.</p>

            <p>I got the “Arr, Matey!” version, losing the ability of multiplayer, to try out the singleplayer.</p>
<p>It’s not bad at all! I thought there were some very clever changes in gameplay, such as Duke being shrunk and driving the RC car, and some of the rail shooting sequences were decent.</p>
<p>I am at “The Hive; Part 2”. I will continue this when I am done trying out Global Agenda.</p>

            <p>I just played 2 hours of DNF, I gotta say, the game is starting to wear on me… even on “Piece of Cake” (Easy) difficulty setting, the game is pretty difficult… There are a couple of jokes in DNF that even I thought were annoying (and I’m the guy that tells annoying Jokes) like the “Leroy Jenkins” reference during the Ruined Las Vegas levels or the one EDF faggot from the same level that swears too much. There are way too many puzzles in Duke 4, IMO. The puzzle where you have to slow the elevator down was overkill (don’t get me started on the whiny bitch in the elevator that screams at you to pull the brakes),  The puzzle in the casino portion with the Duke statue was just retarded, Hitting that button for the last shutter (mini-duke portion of that same level) was pointless. Overall, I’m beginning to get annoyed by all these goddamn puzzles.</p>

            <p>I’ve played it for a bit and it really isn’t that bad. If anything, its biggest problem is the lack of proper pacing, as the game seems to have quite a bit of pointless padding.</p>

            <p>This isn’t nearly as bad as I was expecting from all the reviews. It does have some large problems (fucking quicktime events!) but it’s also really diverse, and there are some really fun little sections so far.</p>
<p>I’ve played much, much worse FPSes this year. I’m looking at you, Homefront.</p>

            <p>you can thank 2K for the “not supporting Dedicated servers” feature, they did it for Bioshit2 as well.</p>

            <p>I loved what the game had to offer (the 2 weapon limit was frustrating for a little bit but the most it did to nerf my gaming experience was force me to stand still in certain areas and decide which 2 guns would be best to use for the next area before I left). I even think the graphics are ok.</p>
<p>I <span class="bbcode-b">did not</span> like that you can’t do anything else but what the game wants you to do. I’m not talking about the SP or MP experiences. I’m talking about customizing. They’ve been claiming that this is first and foremost a PC game. That’s crap. It has none of the features you’d expect from a PC game. The game menu is made for consoles, barely any customizing options for the graphics beyond a couple checkboxes (most everything seems consolidated into the “Post Processing Effects” option), no FOV control (which is a big issue for some), no MOD tools, no in-game console (removed because it would make people cheat in multiplayer, official word), and no options for the unsupported dedicated server feature AT ALL (there’s no console window or anything, no way to moderate and administrate your own server. No option other than Exit. And you can’t join your own server because Steam won’t allow multiple instances of the game EXE). As a PC game it’s pathetic. As a console game, it’s also pathetic due to the insane load times, low res textures, and low framerate.</p>
<p>Besides that the game is great. I loved it. I even like the My Digs level where you can view all the trophies and unlockables available from leveling up in MP.</p>
