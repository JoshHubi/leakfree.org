    <title>Why did they choose the MP7?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-did-they-choose-the-mp7/11124</link>
    <description>I was wondering, why? Why if we&#39;re playing in Eastern Europe,? Being the AK-47 the most produced weapon in the world, and even more in Eastern Europe, it should be used in Half Life 2. Then I realised, maybe it&#39;s a sucessor of the MP5 from Half Life 1... I don&#39;t know, I think Valve may have had a reason to choose it. But anyways I really don&#39;t like the MP7, it&#39;s a micro-SMG, but in the game it&#39;s used as if it was an assault rifle. What do you think?</description>

            <p>I was referring to gore levels such as FEAR or FO. I never said HL wasn’t gory. Just that it wasn’t THAT gory. There’s gore, no doubt about it, but in my opinion it’s minimal. Most of the gore you mentioned is imagined over really occurring, such as the getting eaten alive and the stalkers. Alyx was certainly a gruesome scene by all accounts, but by contrast in other gory games, characters have been ripped open in front of your face by similar attacks. Honestly, the gore in HL is perfect.</p>
<p>Edit: I can’t remember ever dismembering anything besides a zombie, unless you count gunships exploding, since I believe those are part organic.</p>

            <p>Haha I remember doing that in HL. It tripped me out the first time.</p>
<p>On another note: Yes, I understand what you mean by the crowbar. But at the same time, are you taking people’s heads off with it? Because that’s the gore level we were discussing. The games gory enough, imo, with the corpses and zombies included. My whole argument is, quite frankly, originality and keeping to what makes HL what it is, while increasing the gameplay value of the game.</p>
<p>In the end this is all opinion anyways. And off topic really. I want a new game, to answer your question. How I want it differs from what you think seemingly. But that’s because we’re two different people.</p>

<p>That’s <span class="bbcode-i">exactly</span> what Half Life is all about! Why the hell do you think they have you using a crowbar instead of an actual weapon? Because it’s fucking brutal, and it’s whatever is at hand.</p>
<p>Also, no amount of gore is excessive. Every game is exactly as violent as it needs to be at the discretion of its creators.</p>

            <p>Of course I do. But jumping on the idea of excessively gory, rip em to pieces, beat the shit outa the enemy with whatever is at hand kinda removes the nature of HL. It’d be like making an iconic FPS game like CoD 3rd person. It just isn’t something you wanna go over board on. A little change, but keeping that old feeling to it at the same time.</p>
<p>The idea of retrieving crossbow bolts is an example of how to do that. Ripping em outa buildings isn’t a bad idea, it’s just not HL. Same with the electric plug giving you suit power. I liked how they changed the bulky ass canisters from HL to the actual batteries in HL2-&gt;Ep 2. That was a good idea. Still the same old feeling and effect, with a new, fresher look.</p>
<p>But if they were to just take out that, or give you HALO-esque shields, then it would change how it feels. I’m not saying change is bad. It’s not. But changing the look and playability is different from changing core mechanics and the natural feel of being Gordon in HL.</p>

            <p>It’d be cool if you could scavenge crossbow bolts and other supplies actually from the environment. Grabbing rebar from wrecked buildings and draining suit power from power cables, that sort of stuff. But that’s kinda what the gravity gun does already; everything can become a weapon or a tool.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that you can actually tear the monitors off the walls in the citadel with the super gravity gun? I haven’t listened to Breen’s speeches since I first played the game.</p>

            <p>That would make the game violently gory…otherwise, that sounds badass. I think it would work with the crossbow rather than anything with bullets however. Just a little realism is nice.</p>

            <p>I think the last truly unique weapon I used in a game was that one portal gun from Op4, or the ARCH2 from FO:NV.</p>
<p>How do we even define unique? Design, what the effect is…?</p>

            <p>FPSs have always been more fun when there are lots of crazy weapons that each do something unique. These days it’s mostly just endless variations on bullet-throwers and grenades.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the apsci turret system would make for a great basis for a low profile bullet hose.</p>

            <p>If any part of the game does end up taking place on the Borealis and/or the Combine homeworld, I expect we’ll see some pretty interesting weapons. Maybe a potato gun, or combustible lemon grenade :lol: But seriously I’d be quite interested to see some Aperture-designed weapons and some new straight up Combine weapons.</p>

            <p>I kinda hope they do tear the lid off and implement more crazy weapons. Stuff that’s equatable to the hivehand and the gluon.</p>
