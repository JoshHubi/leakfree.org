    <title>Wierd collision/physics bug.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wierd-collision-physics-bug/10930</link>
    <description>I made it up to the mission &quot;Forget about Freeman&quot; without problems, but once I started that mission, collision seemed to turn off for certain things. Grenades/Rockets/Satchels started falling throught the ground when fired, enemies fell through the floor once they were killed, and all the props would start floating across the ground when you bump into them. Has anyone else had this problem? And is there a fix?</description>

            <p>Generally, this usually only happens on multiplayer games when you have a server up for a really long time. Try reloading the map or start the chapter over. It’s a weird bug with the engine itself. The devs can’t do anything about it.</p>
