    <title>Jumping on the relationship thread bandwagon</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/jumping-on-the-relationship-thread-bandwagon/12009</link>
    <description>In the beginning of December, I got very drunk and became intimate with a very close friend I&#39;ve always been attracted to but never had the courage to make a move on.  Now, this friend is very open sexually, so I figured I&#39;d keep it at a friends with benefits type thing.  But then I realized I really wanted to take it to the next level, so I asked her out at the end of the month, and our anniversary is on the 23rd.

Now, what I knew (but really didn&#39;t understand) while dating her was that she identifies as polyamorous, meaning she has a need to have more than one romantic relationship.  That&#39;s not really how I roll, but I figured I would just enjoy myself and have fun...I&#39;d have the capability to go out and date other girls once in a while, so accepted this.  But here&#39;s the thing...she wanted to date her ex-boyfriend on the side.  She had dated him for a year, and had been dumped by him six months prior.  She said she was in love with him.  She also said that I&#39;d be her Primary and gain time and living arrangement benefits, while he&#39;d be the secondary she&#39;d see once in a while.  But since she already loved him, I felt like I would end up being neglected and relegated to a secondary position automatically; I said &quot;NOPE,&quot; and after a long extended discussion, we shelved the idea of dating.  About a week later, she sent me a text telling me to forget about the ex...she wanted me and would be willing to give him up for me.  I accepted.

It took about two weeks for her to bring up the topic of dating her ex again.  She begged.  She pleaded.  She bargained.  She&#39;d give up all other secondaries and hookup buddies...just me and him.  I was a stonewall for the first hour of this.  I said that it was insulting that she&#39;d bring this up again considering it&#39;s what kept me from dating her in the first place.  But she went on and on.  Regrettably, I folded.  I said that she could.  I am weak, what can I say...she wasn&#39;t taking &quot;No&quot; for an answer...and I was afraid of losing her if I continued to refuse.  My reasoning was that I was in a better position than I was in before...she&#39;s understanding, helpful, and patient.  If you know my romantic past and how it damaged me...that&#39;s sort of a huge plus for me.

But now it&#39;s actually happened.  He&#39;s accepted her bid and now he is her secondary.  I want to pretend he doesn&#39;t exist and I told her never to mention him.  But I still know...and now I can&#39;t get it out of my head.  I don&#39;t know how to cope with it.  She says this is a trial period thing and I can end it if I feel like it is damaging our relationship.  But I don&#39;t know how to handle it until I can reasonably call it off.</description>

<p>Yaaaaaa, har har.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, Winged One, you’re on a self-destructive path as of now, so either get rid of her, or get used to this feeling, like Lumburgh said. You’re letting yourself become her fool.</p>

            <p>If you’re going to stay with her, better get used to <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">always feeling this way</span></span>. Are you giving her money (car payments etc.) by any chance?</p>
<p>Also, you know that she’ll have sex with other guys whether you give her permission or not, right? That’s not someone you can trust, and no trust means no sustainable relationship. It’s doomed already whether you try or not. The only question left is how much of a bitch you’ll let her make you into. Sorry.</p>

            <p>What everyone else is saying. I understand that this girl may seem to be like the love of your life, but at the end of the day, you both have different standards of living, and ideals that are too different to make the relationship work out. There isn’t anything wrong with a polygamous relationship, but not everyone is into that. You have to understand that you yourself don’t like this kind of relationship and that you won’t be happy with it. If you continue, you’ll end up hurting yourself purposefully, as you’ll be feeling jealous, lonely, and subpar to the other man this woman wants to date.</p>
<p>End it.</p>

<p>:facepalm: You’re doing it wrong, man. You say you’re just going to take it physically then speak the words of a man trapped in love.<br>
I know it hurts to be alone, especially when you feel for someone, but it’ll hurt more to get burned by her.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>isn’t that better than where I was a couple months back?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No. No it isn’t. You’re on the fast track to getting completely messed up by her and her impulses, and even <span class="bbcode-i">I</span> can see it.</p>
<p>Face it, you’re blinded by your feelings for her. I can’t really blame you; I probably would be too in the same situation.<br>
But that’s why you asked our opinions in the first place, right? To see what you might miss in your emotional blindness.</p>
