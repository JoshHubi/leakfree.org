    <title>[BUG] Unable to Select or See Weapons</title>

    <description>[b]GENERAL BUG INFORMATION[/b]

[i][b]LOCATION[/b][/i]
Not sure if it was location specific but it occurred at the loading zone for &quot;Surface Tension&quot;.

[i][b]DETAILS[/b][/i]
After loading surface tension I immediately unloaded back into the previous zone. After doing this I could no longer see my weapon nor could I switch to any of them. It was as though they simply disappeared from my character.

Also note the top sign of the easter egg is missing as well for some reason?</description>
