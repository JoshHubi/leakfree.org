    <description>Along with [url=&#39;https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=3788&amp;p=1&#39;]today&#39;s blog post[/url] which added the new badge, there seems to have been a new [url=&#39;https://www.teamfortress.com/119/comingsoon.html&#39;]engy update teaser trailer[/url].

[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7BUGi570Zs&#39;]Here[/url] is a breakdown of the trailer if you are too lazy to look for the clues yourself.

If anyone remembers, the old hidden pages of updates long ago seem to hint towards a few things found in the trailer. Some conspiracy theorists say that it is not coincidence that since the &quot;100&quot; newspaper appeared on the menu it will have been 100 days on May 7th, Ironman 2&#39;s release.

Will update as more info comes.</description>

<p>also valve is famous in tf2 for puttin easter eggs in their vids. Like the meet the spy 1, the sniper was wearing a hat unlockable so… maybe there’s something (not only the blueprint) wich can tell us what is he working at, I want a flamethrower sentry!!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>If you read the L4D blog you can see that VALVe likes making teasers like they did for the passing (and the new engy update teaser), also I could have sworn that I’ve seen that exact same torch in the steam forums that a couple of guys were making…</p>

            <p>The breakdown of the trailer was enlightening, I hope they do add some form of robot into the mix, may be enough to get me back into the game. Kudos Valve.</p>
