    <description>Hey guys, long time visitor and fan, finally decided to sign up.  I just have a few minor suggestions for my favorite enemy AI to this day, the HECU Marines.  As a US Marine myself, I&#39;ve always thought they were the most badass, and intelligent AI.  When most other enemies would stay put when you retreated o find health, the Marines would follow you and ruin your day.

But like the original HL, there are some small suggestions for added realism and gameplay.  

1: Marines dont wear berets, they wear the 8-point covers (hats).  If there could be a model of those, that would be epic.
2: Adding the weapon of the element of the USMC fireteam i usually fill, the SAW gunner.
3: Marines yelling &quot;Doc!&quot; or &quot;Corpsman!&quot; instead of medic (Marines don&#39;t have medics, they&#39;re Navy Corpsmen)
4: Oakley sunglasses, perfect fit for the desert-bound HECU Marine
5: Keep doing an amazing job  :slight_smile:</description>

Everyone is perfectly aware that Half-Life, and the characters and events in it are fictional and not even remotely based on real life.</p>
<p>But that really shouldn’t stop us from sharing opinions and ideas, right?</p>

            <p>There shouldn’t be any more detail in the storyline than Half-Life already has. There’s a lot of mysteries in the game, take G-Man for example. I’d just keep it like it was in the original game, allow people to think and discuss about what really might have happened. I wander if there’s a word to describe such a thing.</p>
<p>Another example would be the ending of Shutter Island. You don’t know if he was normal or crazy, leaving you to think about it for hours.</p>

            <p>Well, the “military” (as the scientists call them) was assigned to kill anyone associated with the project.  They began to protest (“Monsters, sure, but civilians?”) so the Black Ops team were called in to kill everyone and everything.  Then, IIRC, it was canonized by the creators and, when the Black Ops couldn’t get the job done, they nuked the facility.</p>
<p>Some people still got out, though, and nuking didn’t solve the problems for Earth.</p>

            <p>If I had to rewrite Half Life I wouldn’t make Marines shoot witnesses. They would be supposed to rescue them and leave 'em in hands of the Black Ops who would later kill them, so they would be our friends in the game. But since they can’t rescue any one, not even themselves, they are ordered to shoot 'em in the place and they disagree, so Black Ops are sent to kill also the Marines and everyone there.</p>
<p>But who does even fucking care about what I think?</p>

<p>^For all I know PMCs don’t have heavy equipment (aside transport helos) but use government hardware (like russians and ukrainians mercenaries piloting ethiopian or angolan fighters during conflicts in the 90’s).</p>
<p>Most of the time PMCs are supporting governmental troops or working as private security. But you’re right they’re also called in when a state don’t want to be publicly involved like keep fighting after UN ceasefire, supporting civil war in neighboring countries or questionable operations (various operations in Sierra Leone around diamond mines for example).</p>
<p>But trust such organization for dealing with a sensitive issue like a research facility gone “rogue” or a possible alien invasion is far-fetched when you can use your own specops.<br>
Its like asking Xe to take out Bin Laden in Islamabad for the US gov.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A PMC can potentially have heavier equipment than the government, it all depends on how much income they generate. It might be illadvized to use a PMC to take care of a mater that could potentially jeopardize national security. PMC’s are essentially mercenaries that are a lot more cohesive since they all have the same Standard Operating Procedures. They are usually more expensive than hiring a bunch of mercenaries separately (depending on the amount of fame or infamy of that mercenary), however there is a set price for the each soldier since they are all working for the same company and make a set rate. Anyhow, they have no loyalty to any state or nation. So one mission they might work for your nation, the next for your enemies. It all depends on which job pays more. The good thing about using PMC’s is that you can deny involvement if it all blows up in your face. If State or Nation sanctioned soldiers are knee deep in shit, they will send any assets deemed necessary to get them out; PMC’s and mercenaries can be hung out to dry when they are in a bad way or if the fuck up royally.</p>

<p>I very much doubt that the US would send their own military to clean up a research facility, killing civilians and nuking it to kingdom come.<br>
PMC, funded and equipped by the US government could efficiently do the job, unofficially.</p>
<p>If it it’s not PMC, then they are carrying out some very shifty orders with extraordinarily dodgy protocol.</p>

<p>There have been instances where US troops had sketchy mission objectives. Such as being sent into a village and told to kill anything that moves. I don’t know of any situations that involved citizens of their own country though. That doesn’t mean it never happens. I have seen something done that makes me question whether or not the US government would send in troops to silence a whole city-sized research facility that technically doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>Sorry for being nitpicky. But yeah, the military operations in BM are anything but legal, and, as shown by the portal storms between HL1 and HL2, unwise and ultimately for nothing.</p>

<p>I suppose you’re right. Been awhile since I last played Half-Life 1 so I can’t quite recall that quote.</p>

            <p>^For all I know PMCs don’t have heavy equipment (aside transport helos) but use government hardware (like russians and ukrainians mercenaries piloting ethiopian or angolan fighters during conflicts in the 90’s).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would venture to guess they were more common than you think. PMC’s tend to act in situations that the government doesn’t want to be link to. The missions are often morally questionable. Most conflicts have not been as televised as the one in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is very possible that PMC’s have been around and much more common than one might think however they were successful and remained a secret.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Most of the time PMCs are supporting governmental troops or working as private security. But you’re right they’re also called in when a state don’t want to be publicly involved like keep fighting after UN ceasefire, supporting civil war in neighboring countries or questionable operations (various operations in Sierra Leone around diamond mines for example).</p>
<p>But trust such organization for dealing with a sensitive issue like a research facility gone “rogue” or a possible alien invasion is far-fetched when you can use your own specops.<br>
Its like asking Xe to take out Bin Laden in Islamabad for the US gov.</p>

            <p>As for the aircraft support, PMCs do sometimes maintain their own fleet, but they could potentially borrow the equipment from the military to cut down on costs. Not sure if that really happens though…</p>
