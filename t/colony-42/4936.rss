<p>Hm. Yes. It was more or less the first thing I did once I figured out how to compile a map with basic entities. As a result it was total crap. So I scrapped it, and decided to start again later. It’s much, much better now. It’s no Black Mesa, but it’s much better than it was.</p>

<p>Colony 42 is the latest incarnation of JeffMOD’s Science-fiction modification, and by far the most developed. The original, known as USS Black Mesa, was scrapped because JeffMOD could not, at the time, understand how to make HL change levels properly.</p>

            <p>Great. Now I feel EXTRA obligated to finish it.<br>
And I’ll feel bad if anyone’s disappointed.<br>

            <p>Whoops. Didn’t see this until I got your PM. I’ve replied to it, so check your User CP.</p>
<p>As for anyone else wondering, the mod’s current status at this time is <span class="bbcode-u">Limbo</span>; I have other, more time-constrained projects to work on, and my little goldsource mod has been shoved aside for a while.</p>
