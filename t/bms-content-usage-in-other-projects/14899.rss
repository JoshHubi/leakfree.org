    <title>BMS content usage in other projects?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bms-content-usage-in-other-projects/14899</link>
    <description>I thought I heard somewhere that the Black Mesa Team was OK with others using BMS assets for other projects as long as they credit them. Is this true, and are there restrictions on what can/cannot be used? I&#39;m working on a Portal 2 mod and want to use a few of the models, so I&#39;m just asking to see if it&#39;s alright. Thanks in advance.

Also wasn&#39;t sure where to post this so if this wasn&#39;t a good place to post this, I&#39;m sorry.</description>

<p>I did a bit of searching around. Apparently, the team is allowing use of retail Black Mesa assets as long as it’s non-commercial. Whether the finer details of Creative Commons still applies is unclear, but you should be able to use retail assets as long as you do not profit in any way from them.</p>

            <p>To be honest, if Crowbar Collective didn’t intend to license the retail version under Creative Commons, they shouldn’t have included the CC-BY-NC license file in the installation folder. As it currently stands, I <span class="bbcode-i">still</span> don’t think we’ve actually gotten confirmation about whether Creative Commons applies to retail, or if that was a mistake. Last time I asked about it, the question got buried and went unanswered, IIRC.</p>
<p>By including the CC-BY-NC license in the retail version, it’s legally implied that Creative Commons is indeed still the license, especially given that no license seems to be included anywhere else with respect to the game’s materials or the website, or even Steam. That implies that anything you can do with the mod, you can also do with the retail version.</p>
