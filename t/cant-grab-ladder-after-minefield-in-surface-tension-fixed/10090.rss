    <title>Can&#39;t grab ladder, after minefield in Surface Tension   [Fixed]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-grab-ladder-after-minefield-in-surface-tension-fixed/10090</link>
    <description>After the minefield in Surface Tension, I am unable to grab/mount the ladder to descend in to the hatch. I am forced to drop the full height. On my first attempt that landed me on some dirt and I took damage. The 2nd attempt (to confirm it wasn&#39;t just me sucking) I landed in water and was spared the damage, but I was still unable to use the otherwise perfectly good ladder.</description>

            <p>In general I’ve noticed ladder mounting is a bit tricky in BM.</p>
<p>I think this ladder I also ended up falling, but I ended up in the water so I didn’t bother to go back and try again.</p>
