    <title>Windows 7 VS. OSX</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-7-vs-osx/2465</link>
    <description>Alright, this isn&#39;t a mac vs. pc thread, but specifically windows 7 vs. OSX.

I personally think this is an absolute no-brainer.

OSX[/SIZE]
Pros:
Don&#39;t have to worry that much about viruses and software issues
Looks nice
Has the thing where you put the mouse in the upper right corner and it shows you all your open windows
Spotlight lets you search your HD very quickly

Cons:
Limited file compatibility and less programs to choose from
Doesn&#39;t play very many games without programs such as crossover games, but they do not work very well (I&#39;ve used crossover games myself)
Very few customization programs
Not a big thing, but the OSX version of google chrome sucks
Has nothing but a dock and a toolbar
iTunes is shit
Can&#39;t use a Zune or Zune software

Windows 7[/SIZE]
Pros:
Amazing ease of use (intuitive controls, tricks like aero shake and aero peek, a task bar, Previews of minimized windows, quickly closing windows while they&#39;re minimized, and many more)
Part of ease of use, pinning objects is extremely useful. Pinned programs can even give options when right clicked like recently played or pinned songs/albums/playlists from media players and my games, store, and friends and pinned games for steam
Supports a massive array of old and new games many
Very very attractive
Lots of customization (go to [url=&#39;https://www.stardock.com/&#39;]Stardock[/url] for examples)
Very very fast
Search your HD quickly from the start menu
All your programs are very quickly accessible from the start menu
An array of programs to choose from for every task
Compatible with almost all file types
Task manager provides lots of useful tools
Compatible with more accessories
Works with Zunes
Zune software
Will be able to play blackmesa :smiley: 

Cons:
You have to deal with drivers
You&#39;ll have to worry more about problems and viruses, but if you install AVG Free and don&#39;t download something stupid you probably won&#39;t get a virus
A little bit of a hassle to install if you currently have xp</description>

            <p>I’d say iTunes is below average… it’s unbearably slow on Windows, and the same on OSX.<br>
I’m still not sure how they managed to make it that slow…</p>

            <p>Windows starting out was basically just a DOS program that gave you a graphical representation of what you were doing in DOS.  In that way, the first Windows <span class="bbcode-i">was</span> basically DOS.  Only you didn’t have to type your commands.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call it a league all it’s own. It’s still an operating system.  Just because you don’t get purdy graphics doesn’t mean it’s any different.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>On a PC &gt; WIN7 for gaming<br>
On an MAC &gt; OSX<br>
For Server Administrating &gt; Any Linux distribution.</p>
<p>I just cant say WIN7 or OSX because it depends on the Computer Structure oO Its like comparing a “Petrol engine” with an “Wankel engine” at two MAZDA Racing cars. I just cant compare them, even the both cars are MAZDA. The one is optimezed for “Petrol engine”, the other for “Wankel Engine”. Of couse when i compare them like “which car looks nicer?” … then i could say: THIS one. But then its only my personel opinion</p>
<p>Same at WIN7 and OSX. WIN7 brings a lot of features for the PC structure. OSX for MAC Structure. I really cant say i like WIN7 more, because it has tons of stuff more than OSX (or converse) … I have to relativize it. Its like saying: “Oh no! Lenny debian 5.0 has nooo grafical interface! I like Windows 98 more than this because i miss that feature to klick on ugly fat buttons” Its simply too … wah its simply to shallow. Also i cant say MAC is faster! Of Course it is! its another structure and runs faster with less RAM or something. But then i still cant say, that i would prefere any operating system on the basis of the features …</p>
<p>Well i suppose my english is horroble xD</p>

<p>Oh I know!  There’s just nothing like it!  The low cost, the upgradable hardware, the gaming capabilities, and the features that windows <span class="bbcode-i">totally</span> doesn’t have!</p>
<p>It does it all!  Fuck you, Bill Gates and your monopolizing empire!</p>

<p>But that’s the point; there’s no free equivalent of Garageband, let alone one that comes free with the operating system itself. And it doesn’t stop there; there’s iWeb, iMovie, iPhoto and Photo Booth, all of which are very big programs which all get a lot of use on my computer, and all of which are better than their Windows OS equivalents.</p>
<p>That said, I’ve heard that the most recent inception of Windows Movie Maker isn’t that bad.</p>

<p>That’s also the point; Windows’ longevity is lousy. Snow Leopard isn’t much better, but that’s only because they dropped support for the Power PC computers (i.e. the G series). 10.6 will run on any Intel Mac, so that’s going back to '05 (IIRC). Going back a step, 10.5 kept support for most G4 Macs and above; the G4 Mac was first sold in 1999, and 10.5 was released in '07, meaning that any computer sold in the intervening 8 years could run the latest operating system, as well as still being able to run all of the latest software. And, what’s more, I’ve seen it done; I have a G3 running 10.4, and my friend has a G4 running 10.5. And they run <span class="bbcode-i">well</span>.</p>
<p>On the other side of the fence, I’ve seen some horrific examples of PCs having the longevity of a nervous teenager on prom night; they last for 5 minutes, the experience is pretty unenjoyable and everybody walks away feeling completely underwhelmed. My friend had a stock-standard PC from '97, which, after numerous hard disk and RAM upgrades, was at a state of almost complete non-working…ness…after installing XP in '01. The need to constantly upgrade hardware just to get the operating system itself to run is appalling, and its a really big advantage of streamlined hardware.</p>
<p>Its all very well to say “Windows 7 runs very well on modern hardware”, but that’s a big problem for people who want to upgrade from older PCs and who want to run it on lower-spec’d PCs (like cheap laptops and netbooks for two). Very well spec’d PCs will probably be able to run it (like my 3Ghz monster out the back that we built in ‘03 that gives it a pretty good run for its money), but more modest PCs (i.e. those that most people buy) will obviously struggle. And Windows’ borderline misinformation campaign with minimum system requirements certainly doesn’t help things.</p>
<p>My point is, basically, that Apple computers last longer. If you’re willing to put in the big bucks when buying a PC, then you get that same longevity, but you don’t have to put in those extra big bucks while buying a Mac to know that your computer wont just drop off the map when the next shiny new operating system comes along.</p>

            <p>My sister shouts at Windows OS because it’s so slow, she’s an OS X user as she is a music lover and plays the keyboard, OS X fits the need as it’s clean, comes with support for her keyboard and worked straight away with what she wanted to do. When it comes to Windows, she can’t install a driver and find a free-ware music recording program if she had to do it to survive, so there’s bias for the fact that she can’t use Windows.</p>
<p>I do use all 3, Mac, Windows, Linux, I would say I’m unbiased but I don’t know if I am or not as OS X is just better despite me using Windows 70% of the time and Linux 20%, Windows has games, Linux has my office on it and is really compact.<br>
But saying that will have people shout at me saying I can’t say I’m unbiased just because I use all 3 and use Windows most and still say OS X is better, they’ll say I don’t know what a good OS is, a good OS is Linux, a clean OS is OS X, a cluttered crazy OS is Windows Vista, a functional OS is Windows 7.</p>
<p>I program for all 3 also.</p>
