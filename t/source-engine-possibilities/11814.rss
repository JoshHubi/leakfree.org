    <title>Source engine possibilities?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-engine-possibilities/11814</link>
    <description>Hi,
I&#39;m an indie developer using Flash and Unity3D, and I&#39;ve stumbled upon this Source Engine. It says that it is free to use for anyone who has bought a source-based game, which I coincidentally have (Counter Strike: Source). But I have some questions regarding the possible uses of this engine. I know this can be used to create Half Life 2 mods, but can you also use it for standalone games, meaning that the player doesn&#39;t need Half Life 2 installed in order to play the game? And, if so, do you have the right to monetize your game, or is the license for non-commercial use only?

Thanks,
Arne Gevaert</description>

<p>you can make money(sell your game) only if you have a source engine license, otherwise you can ship it as a mod.</p>

            <p>Valve have a NDA on licensing their source engine. However, you can create anything you want using source and release it for free. If you buy the license I assume you get more access to the code but I do not know, either way you can code with the free version too.</p>
<p>They have a big list of source engine capabilities on their website which I think they recently revamped:<br>
<a href="https://source.valvesoftware.com/index.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://source.valvesoftware.com/index.php</a></p>
<p>So yes, standalone is possible with the license.</p>
