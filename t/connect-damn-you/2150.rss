    <title>Connect damn you!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/connect-damn-you/2150</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been having some serious problems with my steam servers. Ever since I reinstalled the thing I&#39;ve been unable to connect to anything remotely multiplayer.

Essentially whenever I hit refresh on the server tab I will only get ONE server at a time, and it will usually have a ping of over 300. Trying to do this in game gives even less results.

When I actually find a rare under 300 server it will either be so full of custom wavs and maps so it takes 2 hours to join, or will simply fail to connect.

This issue happens for both Source and GldSrc games.

I&#39;ve tried everything, turing off every firewall I have, allowing anything steam related, opening all the ports and all to no avail.

Any ideas? At least before I decide to punch out my screen.</description>

            <p>Nah, definitely fixed it. Apparently the Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI) on the router blocked everything. Occasionaly a server would send through expected packets, and that’s why only one showed up. Then when I tried to connect it would block it and time out.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help anyway!</p>

            <p>I would back up and recheck ALL the settings of steam myself, including what sersoft said about resetting the modem.  The ultimate last resort is re-installing steam.  Cuz you never know that it will actually help.  :retard:</p>

            <p>It’s true I remember my friend had to reset his modem and his router before steam started working properly again.</p>

            <p>No, I had firewall off the entire time. That was my first suspicion.</p>

            <p>Well, if you’ve fixed it, good, but I might as well make another suggestion, Just in case.</p>
<p>Re-installing it may have added it to Windows Firewall again, and rejecting it from connecting to the Internet.</p>
<p>So just add Steam and hl2.exe to the exceptions list.</p>

            <p>I worked with a friend and I think we narrowed it down to a packet inspecting protocol on the router.</p>

            <p>I saw a similar problem at someone else’s house and we never figured out what was causing it cuz it was on and off, so the problem was very hard to identify, and it went away by itself after a while.</p>
<p>Maybe check for proxy settings in internet options and make sure it’s disabled.</p>
