    <title>Bullsquids don&#39;t realize melee attacks</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bullsquids-dont-realize-melee-attacks/14143</link>
    <description>I found a bug with these enemies. This enemies don&#39;t run to you. Only attack launching radioactive attacks in a long distance, and this is boring. In HL1, these enemies run to you and hit you with their tails.

Thanks! I hope people see this.   :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>I finished BM today, and I noticed this little issue. I remember that Bullsquids were used to charge the player in the first version of BM (2012).</p>

            <p>They go after Headcrabs rather aggressively with all the attacks you mention.</p>
<p>Bullsquids are weird.  I had a situation where I had one at the end of a long hallway and I wanted him to spit down it, like a turret.  It would seem that after every second or third spitting, he would waste a lot of time repositioning (even with a line-of-sight to the player), walking in the opposite direction, and not reacting to getting shot while this happened.  To try and improve this, I gave him an aiscripted_schedule and told him, hey, keep attacking the player and don’t stop.  And this caused him to do his 360 spin attack for no apparent reason, even though I was halfway across the level.  In fact, it was possible to stunlock him because he refused to move on to his normal routine until he did that 360 spin - every time he was shot, it would reset the spin animation and he’d try again.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I agree,  before in HL and it’s expansions I had a huge fear of Bullsquids, I dunno why but they are just terrifying to me…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
And they  would charge at you if you are in a running distance to them which was scary lol. But now they just vomit on you and you shoot at them while dodging their attacks…</p>
