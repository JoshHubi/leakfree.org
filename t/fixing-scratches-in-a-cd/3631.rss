    <title>Fixing scratches in a CD</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixing-scratches-in-a-cd/3631</link>
    <description>Is it possible? I have a CD with commercial audio recording software that I&#39;ve grown fond of, but it somehow got scratched while in storage. I wanted to install it on my new computer, but no dice... whenever I try to install it, the installer tells me to put the CD in the drive- which it already is.

So, is there a way to do it? If so, what&#39;s the best (safest) way? Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>This might sound really weird, but rubbing toothpaste and then wiping away the excess works, it’s how I got my full throttle cd to work again and some of my other mac classic games.</p>

            <p>lol</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you for certain that toothpaste works on small scratches.  My Silent Hill 2 disk was pretty well fucked when I shook the Xbox while it was in the drive.  I used toothpaste and it worked forever after.</p>
<p>Then again, I tried it on my friend’s Mirror’s Edge disk after his buddy’s dog got a hold of it.  Didn’t do shit.  It’s not a fix-all.</p>

            <p>I was going to polish it with toothpaste, but the directions recommended cleaning it with warm water first. I guess sometimes just wiping it off with a shirt doesn’t work. :<br>
Anyway, if I ever get something that can’t be fixed that way, I will try what you guys suggested.</p>

<p>Nor do I.</p>
<p>I’d try polishing it with either ToothPaste with Flouride, or metal polisher.<br>
If that doesn’t work, You could take it to a store and get it fixed. Stores that do it usually charge about 2-7 bucks. Although I’m not sure if you’re not in america…<br>
Deep scrathes usually can’t be fixed even when you take it to a store or buy something that fix’s discs. And do even try to fix it yourself…<br>
I used the toothpaste method on my GTAIV disc and it worked great. Same with y old Hitman 2 PC cd that got lost for about 3 years…</p>

            <p>Like the others have said here, it depends on how deep the scratches are and how the scratches are placed.  There’s a device I bought that helps in some cases in the short term called a “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00080YK9Y/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_2?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B00005B9W6&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1109ZVVKF75713C6V00G" data-bbcode="true">Skip Doctor</a>”.  What it does is basically wear down the coating on the disc to make the scratches less apparent to the drive’s laser.</p>
<p>It will leave the read side of the disc dull and have what appears to be whirls on it.  The scratches will still be visible to you (and look like you’ve just run the disc through a belt sander), but it (may) be invisible to the drive’s laser.</p>
<p>Then, rip an image of your disc to an ISO, throw a blank disc into your burner and then burn the ISO onto the new disc.</p>

            <p>I don’t know about commercial scratch repair stuff, but I’ve had decent results with car wax and very light rubbing compound.  But I’ll agree that deep scratches are pretty hard to overcome. Or if there are scratches on the top side that physically damage the recording material, then it’s a lost cause.</p>

            <p>Depending on how deep the scratches are the best thing I found was to use Brasso which is a metal polish and a lint free cloth to polish the disk. You can find Brasso in just about any store (Walmart ect.) If you don’t have a lint free cloth a car shammie would do. If the scratches are really deep then Brasso will not help. They do sell scratch removing tools but I don’t know how well they work and they are somewhat expensive. Good luck!</p>

            <p>You could try toothpaste, but that does not always work, although it did help my MW1 disc. You could also try going down to your local shop, most shops that deal in discs will repair scratched discs.</p>
