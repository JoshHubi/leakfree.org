    <title>BM mini pack - HL1 sounds combined with BM sounds</title>

    <description>[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B56gd9FfjdY&#39;]Black Mesa - HL1 combination sound effects[/url]

This small pack changes the gluon, hivehand, and tripmine (and adds the HL1 weapon select sound)

Rather then straight up replace these sounds with the HL1 sounds (since I thought they sounded good) I opted to combine them together, so while it sounds more like HL1 you still get to hear the new BM sounds.

I chose the gluon and hivehand specifically because the sounds for both were a simple sound that could easily be overlayed with the old one, and I think especially on the Gluon, the effect is quite nice.

            <p>Xalener was doing something exactly like this, but he did practically every weapon and NPC. Wonder when he’s gonna release it.</p>

<p>Pretty nice - the Black Mesa team did a nice job on creating their own alternative sounds, so combining them with the original HL1 sounds allows for some extra nostalgia without undoing the BM work. You’re right, the gluon in particular works well.</p>

<p>Nice work man !</p>
<p>Do you think it’s possible to use the Hl1 Voice on BMS ? ( in order to having more languages) ?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
