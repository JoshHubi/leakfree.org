    <title>More human remains found at the 9/11 site.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/more-human-remains-found-at-the-9-11-site/4611</link>
    <description>So more human remains have been found in and around Ground Zero, some 9 years after the original attacks.

it seems that in this case, some of the body parts are large and can be identified to specific victims of the attack. Medical examiners are taking a look at some of them.

            <p>I find it disgusting how alot of Americans (not saying anyone in this thread, IRL) wear 9/11 like some badge of pride, using it as a sort of pity pass, saying about how hard done the american people are and how they have survived through this “terrible act of terror” even though they wern’t even in the same city and don’t know ANYONE who was in those towers.</p>
<p>Honestly people, (Not directed towards any of you guys ITF) 9/11 was tragic, there were a handful of nuts who took their trouble out on alot of random people for the hell of it, but don’t fucking use their deaths as a ladder for your own pride. Thats not respecting anyone, thats spitting on their corpses. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/rage.png?v=9" title=":rage:" class="emoji" alt=":rage:"></p>

            <p>No, there are no towers built. They are basically just moving dirt around right now until someone figures out what exactly they want to build there, what it should look like, and who is going to pay for it.</p>
<p>We should have had this thing finished within 3 years… a park… a memorial… an office building… a new tower… SOMETHING should be there by now.</p>

            <p>And I’m just saying that’s an incredibly stupid analogy, because making an effort to clean up 4 city blocks worth of collapsed is not equivalent to removing all evidence of history’s largest war from an entire country. Didn’t we already have a talk about your analogies in another thread?</p>
<p>In case i’m not making myself sufficiently clear THE TOWERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REBUILT BY NOW, OR TURNED INTO A MEMORIAL PARK, OR SOMETHING. It’s unbelievable to me that they are still clearing rubble away a decade later, for fucks sake. Apparently nobody else thinks that’s significant. Maybe they are waiting until the economic and geopolitical fallout fixes itself, and then they can finish cleaning up the actual site?</p>

            <p>I agree with you shadi.  For the simple fact that your skin is darker and you come from a decedent line that is sometimes associated with terrorists.  This is regardless of the fact that all colors, religion, shapes, sizes, creeds, races, and species have done some major screw ups that could be called horrific.  But I agree. If you would have shown such callous disregard for the thousands that died in a matter of hours, yes, you would have been crucified.</p>
<p>:s igh:</p>
<p>But all of that really is getting away from the real topic at hand though isnt it.  Of which I think is more about the fact that remains are still being found.  I dont think it states the parts are very large. Only that dna testing can be done.</p>

<p>So by downplaying the significance of the attack you would be considered a terrorist? Surely the aim of terrorism is to use significance of events to inspire terror in a populace, and hence reducing that impact is contrary to their aims?</p>
