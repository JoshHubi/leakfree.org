    <title>Windows 8 Laggy In-Game Play</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-8-laggy-in-game-play/11750</link>
    <description>Hello,
I have recently upgraded to Windows 8.
Unfortunately I upgraded before finishing Black Mesa.
Because when I go in to play Black Mesa, it now runs incredibly slow.
I saw that somebody else here had the same issue with Windows 8, and he fixed his problem by &#39;Running as an Administator&#39;
I have already tried to run steam as an administrator and play Black Mesa, and the problem still persists.

The warnings that come up in the console are:

Error! Variable &quot;$surfaceprop&quot; is multiply defined in material &quot;models/props_c17/oil_drum_chunks001a&quot;!
Attempted to create unknown entity type Default!
NULL Ent in UTIL_PrecacheOther


Performance warning: Merge with &#39;weapons/w_glock_lh.mdl&#39;. Mark bone &#39;ValveBiped.Bip01_L_Hand&#39; in model &#39;humans\hassassin.mdl&#39; as being used by bone merge in the .qc!

and


Attempted to create unknown entity type Default!
NULL Ent in UTIL_PrecacheOther


Please let me know if there is a fix to this Windows 8 problem! And if so, when can I expect a fix?
Thank you very much.</description>

            <p>Maybe you need a new laptop.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  However, every time there’s a new <a href="https://personalmoneynetwork.com/moneyblog/2012/09/26/gray-market-premium/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">iPhone</a>, people line up worldwide, waiting outside Apple stores, sometimes for days, to be among the first to get it. It’s the height of stupidity; the phone isn’t any different a few days later. Furthermore, if one waits about a year, it gets cheaper and the bugs in the darn thing haven’t even been discovered yet.</p>

            <p>I went to Control Panel &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Programs and set it so Steam opens as it would on Windows 7.<br>
However, it still got extremely laggy during the end sequence, and the first time the fast stealthy pistol shooters came in. Almost unplayable.<br>
Upon opening the console there were many errors.<br>
The rest of the game ran smooth.</p>
