    <title>Amazing game, but needs more Gibbing options!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/amazing-game-but-needs-more-gibbing-options/13978</link>
    <description>2nd playthrough for me, disappointed to see gib mechanics (blowing up bodies with damage) do not match HL1 and still have not made it in-game yet.

One great example is corpses being hit by the crowbar. In HL1 they would explode into gibs after like 5 hits, in Black Mesa they just die and you cant gib them after death.

I see you already have gibs fully realized in-game, certain weapons and events cause bodies to explode. Please consider adding this feature! It was so fun to do to zombies in HL1!</description>
