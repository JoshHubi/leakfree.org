            <p>With an LCD its image persistence, which is a little different than image burn which is seen on CRTs.</p>
<p>Try displaying a single color for a while (not sure how long, try it for 48hrs and see if it goes away). This “resets” the crystals in the display. You can do this by creating a picture in MS Paint and fill it with a color, then run it as a slideshow full-screen with Windows Image Viewer and turn the screensaver/monitor power-saving mode off.</p>

            <p>Try not using it for awhile (unplug it and don’t turn it on), it helped me once, but it was a very faint image. Like for a day or two. Also, if you get it fixed, try changing the brightness on it. That might help (if you haven’t already.)</p>
