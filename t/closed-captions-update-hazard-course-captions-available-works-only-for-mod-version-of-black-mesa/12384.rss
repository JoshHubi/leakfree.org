The bases above include patched maps for the Inbound chapter (c0a0a - c0a0c), the last On a Rail map (Patched version of TextFAMGUY1&#39;s map is also included in case you have OaR Uncut installed), map c2a5g for Surface Tension, the first Forget About Freeman map to resolve captions bug (ST Uncut Base uses patched version of TextFAMGUY1&#39;s map), a game_sounds_manifest.txt file (one of them modified to be compatible with Surface Tension Uncut), and a game_sounds_ambient_generic_cc.txt file for the scripts. The captions updates include more corrections and fixes for the captions and new captions for the VOX lines. Several of them also include a scenes.image file to make more than one mod work properly.

Before installing one of the 2 bases, you will need to backup the Inbound maps (c0a0a - c0a0c), the final On a Rail map c2a2c, map c2a5g for Surface Tension,  the first Forget about Freeman map in the &quot;maps&quot; folder, and the game_sounds_manifest file. Once you backed all of these up, you can extract either version of the bases to the &quot;BMS&quot; folder. After that, backup your closecaption_english files in the &quot;resource&quot; folder, download one of the versions of the Closed Captions Updates and extract any version of them to the &quot;BMS&quot; folder. [b]**[/b]

If you have downloaded On a Rail Uncut, you will have to locate the bm_c2a2c and folder named graphs in the BMS folder. Move both of these into the maps folder. You should be prompted to replace a couple files or so. Click yes.

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;][b]** If you&#39;re planning to download any mods for Black Mesa, please install them into your BMS folder before doing this.[/b]

[u][b]Known Issues:[/b][/u]

[s]1. Several of the captions in the Inbound chapter and the final On a Rail map fade out before the line is completely heard.[/s]

[b][s]Inbound[/s][/b]


[s]1. In map C0A0C, this [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/hbxzYHi.jpg&#39;]caption[/url] fades out at &#39;biotechnology&quot;[/s]
[s]2. In the same map, this [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/QrCYv53.jpg&#39;]caption[/url] fades out around &quot;contact your radiation safety officer immediately&quot;[/s]
[s]3. In map C0A0B, this [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/DCigOpk.jpg&#39;]caption[/url] fades just after the dialogue is finished. It should fade out a couple seconds [b]after[/b] the dialogue ends.[/s]
[s]4. In the same map, this [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/eXZ3jpn.jpg&#39;]caption[/url] fades out at &quot;electrified rails&quot;[/s]


[b][s]On a Rail[/s][/b]


[s]1. In the [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/3fs9bRp.jpg&#39;]last On a Rail map[/url], this caption fades out after the HECU VOX says &quot;remaining&quot;[/s]
[s]2. In the [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/SPzkx3e.jpg&#39;]same map[/url], this caption fades out after the HECU VOX says &quot;8...&quot;[/s]


[s]I don&#39;t know how to fix this issue as all I can do with Source SDK is edit the captions and compile them. If anybody knows how to fix this issue, please let me know. I really want this mod to be as polished as it can.[/s]


[s]All of the screenshots are what the captions are before they fade out early.[/s]

Edit: Fixed as of [b]v1.31[/b][/size]

<p>[/size]<br>
Hi everyone. It’s been a long time since I updated this. For almost 2 years, I never knew how to fix an issue with several lines where certain Inbound and On a Rail captions (the last map to be specific) would fade out before you finish hearing them. Just recently, [/size]TSL16b told me that there’s a working command called <a>len:X</a> which is used to keep subtitles on the screen as long as I want it to. Thanks to him, this issue is now gone. [/size]<br>
[/size]<br>
[/size]<br>
[COLOR=‘Blue’]<span class="bbcode-b">Note: If you never installed the captions mod before, you will need to download either the Stock Base or the Surface Tension Uncut Base depending on whether or not you have mods like Surface Tension Uncut).</span>[/size][/size][/size][/size]</p>

            <p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">Closed Captions Update v1.29 is now out!</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>This update includes captions from the B1 map. In order for the captions for that map to work properly, you will need to download one of the versions of the patched maps first and then download the captions fix for what mods you have installed in your BMS folder. After you extract the patched maps to your BMS folder, make sure the graphs folder and the map files (bm_c2a2b1 and bm_c2a2c) are moved to the BMS folder’s maps subfolder (this is for anyone who’s playing On a Rail Uncut). After that, you can extract one of the caption fixes to your BMS folder.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">Update: Hotfix for v1.29!</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>If you already downloaded one of the versions of the patched maps, please redownload it. I realized that I made the sound for the dialogue much louder than it was in the original version of Text’s B1 map. This should be fixed now.</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">One more thing!</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>Apparently, the stock version of the captions fix didn’t have the sci_eli_notellingwhatdanger01 reverted back like the other 3 versions. If you’re using the stock version of the captions fix, please redownload it.</p>

 Open Source Forever:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>How come there’s no “On a Rail Uncut” version of this captions fix?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I changed up how the captions fix works by having 2 separate downloads. One download would be the Stock and Surface Tension Uncut versions of the patched maps (which also includes the patched On a Rail Uncut C map if you have that mod installed) and the other would be the captions fix for whatever mods you have installed. This is done so that I don’t have to make an On a Rail Uncut version of the captions fix. You’ll need to download both of them in order for the captions mod to work properly.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, I could add a patched version of Text’s B1 map to the Stock and Surface Tension Uncut versions of the patched maps so that I can get the captions for the “Shoot him in the face!” scene to show up.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone. It’s been a long time. How have you been? I’ve been really busy being dead… Just kidding. I’m fine.</p>
<p>I’ve got some good news: After one year since bringing the first version of the Closed Captions Update, I’ve finally fixed an issue with the grd01_idle_physicstorocketscience lines! These lines are for the following dialogue in the end of the Power Up chapter: “Man… Theoretical physics. And now rocket science. Good thing one of us was hitting the books while the other one was chasing tail. Or… ya know… just playing computer games.”</p>
<p>After almost 5 months of no updates,</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">Closed Captions Update v1.28 is finally here!</span>[/SIZE]</p>

            <p>Sometime ago, Dadster once told me that people would be less likely to download every update due to small updates with big file downloads. With this in mind, I came up with a solution to prevent having to download the same patched maps over and over again for each update.</p>
<p>Two of the versions of my mod (Stock and Surface Tension Uncut versions) are now the bases of the captions update mod. You need to download that and one of the caption updates for one of the versions of the bases. If you any mods installed (or more than one if you’re using the STU Base version) however, don’t worry. You will have the option to download a captions updates specific to the mods you have installed.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that 4 versions of the caption updates that have Hazard Course mentioned don’t have any links to them. The reason is because the Hazard Course mod is not out yet. When that mod is out, I’ll release the other updates.</p>
<p>Edit: I just realized that I need to put in small captions updates for stock and STU version like the others. Will remedy this very soon.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Fixed. My post is edited for the small change I made to this format.</p>

            <p>I have decided to put the patched version of the OaR Uncut’s c2a2c and a separate graphs folder in all versions of the mod. Because of this, the STU/OaR version &amp; STU, OAR and Uplink version of the mod have been removed. The OP and the readme files will be updated due to this change.</p>
<p>Edit: The four versions of the mod are ready.</p>

            <p>[COLOR=‘Red’]<span class="bbcode-b">Closed Captions Update v1.24 has been released!</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>Thanks to Entspy, I managed to get the Launchpad and HECU VOX captions for the On the Rail Uncut versions of the mod to show up.</p>
<p>Edit: I also updated what each version includes and installation instructions in the OP. Will update the readme soon.</p>
