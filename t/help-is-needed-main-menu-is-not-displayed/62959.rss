    <description>Help is needed!!! Main menu is not displayed. 
After starting the game, I get to the main menu screen, but the menu lines themselves are not visible (but it is audible when I visit them). Of course, they are not clickable, and when you try to start the game just stops working.
How to fix it?
The cache checked - everything is intact. System requirements are minimal.
I did not install mods.</description>
