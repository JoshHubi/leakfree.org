socialism - what is wrong with it? Why would it not be good in America? What
makes capitalism better?
[/quote]
Socialism breeds laziness. Why should I work if someone else will do it for
me? 
 
Why, indeed? Because eventually you reach the point where more people are
NOT working than those who are, and eventually it becomes apparent that
those who ARE working don&#39;t have enough hours in the day to support those
who aren&#39;t working. 
 
Perhaps the best way of making an objective comparison between Socialism and
Capitalism is to look at which countries employ which system. OK, so which
countries are leaders of the free world, and which ones are second-rate?</description>

            <p>If the blue dude was holding the gun for capitalism it would be more accurate, at least.<br>
And the blue dude would be holding a second bag of money while handing the first one over under socialism, while the red dude would be handing both bags over under capitalism.<br>
That would still be pretty fucking stupid though.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, MysticJ, but I don’t understand what you would consider a “desire to work” then.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s exactly it – there is no such thing as “desire to work”. A desire to work would mean that no matter how hard or easy, repetitive or changing, short or long, work you’re told to perform, you’d feel positive, satisfying emotions.</p>
<p>But that’s not it, right? You probably like to work the way you do, but it’s not because of the work itself but because of the results – be it money, appraisal, creation, feeling of accomplishment…</p>

            <p>Eater: The problem with that position is that absolutely no one is a “success” all by themselves. It is impossible. Many thousands of people helped in ways unimaginable. Beginning at birth (and even BEFORE birth) with government helping to regulate health procedures, all the way up to shipping and receiving and contract law in big business. Throughout one’s entire life, the big evil <span class="bbcode-i">SOCIALIST!</span> government that can’t do anything right, helping them every step of the way.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it is my not-so-humble opinion that only those that take themselves wholly “off-the-grid” and become a hermit can call themselves an “individualist”.</p>

            <p>Personally I’m sort of a centreist, I don’t really agree with socialism or capitalism. People who actively earn their fortune should be allowed to keep it but people who earn millions just through inheritence or something similar should be taxed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So my desire to work doesn’t exist?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just because you call something one way doesn’t make it that way. Way too many people say “I love you” when in fact their feelings are closer to “I fancy you”. Similarly, I suspect that what you call “a desire to work” is not actually “a desire to work”. Maybe you are addicted to the chemical reactions in your body associated with certain phases of your work, such as when you “solve something” or “are appraised for your performance”. But “desire to work”? As in “I desire to exhaust my energy reserves”?</p>
<p>Please try to read again what I wrote before – evolution/invention are driven by attempts to make life easier. And we are able to temporarily work really hard in order to achieve something that we consider important, but the most prevalent reason why we consider something important is that it makes our lives easier, such as by acquiring a social status that will provide us with ever-present protection by others, or acquiring a suitable life partner who will support us should we get into trouble or be injured or ill…</p>
<p>Even creative workers (artists) are most probably not driven by “desire to work”, but by desire to experience again the pleasant feelings associated with the completion of a piece of art. Somewhere deep within, they hope that if they work really hard, they will reach a position where money or “girlz” will no longer be an issue…</p>

            <p>But this isn’t limited to government.  If you didn’t get paid, for example, and you worked for a two-person company, you would get paid right away.  In a 100,000±person company (like the one I work for), if you didn’t get paid, it’d be anywhere between 3-5 business days to 2 weeks to get your pay.</p>
<p>There’s a reason that passports take a long time and it has nothing to do with the speed and efficiency of our government.   The necessity for passports to visit Canada and return, however…</p>

            <p>Actually, at a certain age you are able to mail in the Passport form, meaning you don’t have to directly deal with the any officials, and speeding up the process. My point is that if you ever have to directly deal with the government in a non-routine issue (i.e. having to actually set up a passport meeting) they become even slower, and the more government does the more they will have to deal with non-routine issues.</p>

<p>Yes, they can do it right. But they can’t do it fast. I got my passport, but it took over a month.</p>

<p>Since the dawn of man, people have worked to provide for themselves, their family, their tribe, whatever.  Whether it’s going out to kill a buffalo to provide food or whether it’s weaving a basket to hold fruit.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, from the dawn of man, people tried to provide for themselves and those who depend on them with as little effort as possible. That’s why they moved to caves, which provide shelter, instead of trying to survive in the open plains. That’s why they later invented “stick and stone”, then later bronzework and silverwork and ironwork, why wheel was invented, why they domesticated animals. The urge to make life easier is the power source behind all human inventions. It is this urge to make life easier that lead to today’s society. Even in the 20th century, we saw many inventions, which make life so much easier and comfortable – be it the “Iron”, Microwave oven, remote control, escalator, cars…</p>
<p>But there is no such thing as “desire to work” or “wanting to work”.</p>

<p>The key issue with any Socialized anything here in the US (I don’t know about Europe, its a different situation), is that our government is legendarily inefficient. Want to get a pass port as a minor? Go wait outside the post office for three hours before they tell you to come back six hours later. Or wait for an appointment. For at least 2 weeks.<br>
It just doesn’t work here.</p>

<p>Thats why Medicare/Medicaid are so unpopular, and Senior Citizens are queuing up for miles to buy back into privatized Health Care, right?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It just occurred to me that a society which pays its employees according to their service’s essentiality is likely to fare better in a disaster scenario.</p>
<p>Let’s take some bogus scenario, zombies for instance. A man who works at a water treatment facility and gets paid 20k a year… he’s going to look out his window, see some zombies, and say <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">“Fuck that shit, I’m calling in sick today.”</span></span> Whereas, if his essential job paid more substantially, he might think <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">“I’d like to keep my job for when this all blows over…it’s not terribly stressful and it pays pretty well. Honey, fetch me the cricket bat. I’m going to work.”</span></span></p>
<p>So, as people working at marketing firms stay inside since creating a commercial for <span class="bbcode-i">Zombie-Off</span>™ doesn’t pay very well, the real necessary jobs remain more stable, and the food, water, and electricity sectors continue to churn a little more than they would if they paid less.</p>
<p>Janitors are still unessential though. Which is fine, since they make for pretty skilled zombie-hunters.</p>
<p>Has anyone done a zombie-flick within a prison setting? That might be interesting…</p>
