    <description>Yo. So I was playing with my friend, and then I accidentally changed primary fire key to tab. When I changed it back, I wanted to change the showstats key back too. To my suprise, there was no option to do so in key menu. Desperated, I decided to just change keys to default settings. And then I realised that this didn&#39;t do anything, because my keys bindings stayed as it was. Those are some strange bugs. Repair it please, if you find some time.</description>

            <p>I know about that, and thank you for trying to help, but my problem is that there is no such an option in the main menu.</p>
<p>Still, thanks for attention</p>

            <p>Go to SteamApps\common\Black Mesa\bms\cfg<br>
Open config.cfg with a text editor, I prefer Notepad++</p>
<p>Look for +showscores. Change whatever you have in the “” to “TAB”:<br>
Yeah I understand you probably want the devs to patch a fix, but they will probably not as all their focus is on xen (and if they patched anything without including xen, they’d probably get a backlash for it).</p>
