            <p>Well, let’s be honest, Crytek had/have always their engine to rely on, the games themselves were never that innovative or revolutionary (except maybe the NanoSuit and the semi-open World in Crysis 1). But the Sandbox Editor is excellent for mapping and modding, the engine is really capable, so I’m wondering why so few Studios actually use them… Well, Ladies and Gents, High Tech from Germany (well, in the first days, I presume Crytek develops in other countries, outsourcing these days, sheesh…) !</p>
<p>Only one thing I have to bitch about was how the cardboxes in the weather simulation didn’t move… I guess that’s because they were textures or static objects and no physic objects, but it would look more realistic this way. Things like wind stirred dust or something along those line would be a nice touch too… still pretty impressive Engine.</p>
<p>Regarding Source: The Animation (Not only the facial animation) is still today among the best. But let’s face it, it’s totally outdated by todays standard. But it impressed me what Developers can still get out of Source, see Titanfall for that matter…</p>

<p>Blasphemy around these parts, I know, but I was never all that impressed with the way Source looked. It presents itself well enough for what it has been used in, but it never grabbed my eye like some other technologies have. For the most part, it always seemed rather bland to me.</p>
<p>Cryengine’s new presentation looks beautiful. I wonder how it will really look in game.</p>

<p>Source still has some of the best facial animations in the industry when used right. I wasn’t around for when it came out (not literally, but I wasn’t a computer game player then) but I’ve seen the reveal demo and it seemed to get a strong reaction from the audience. I like Cryengine too when used right (which was really only in Far Cry and Crysis, Crysis 2 had shitty filters over it but it still looked nice) but it’s not used anywhere near as much as UE3 is, which makes me sad.</p>

            <p>It looks nice, but I’m just hoping it comes shipped with no nanosuit in the engine.<br>
Getting tired of removing it when creating mods.If they still stick to the free license, and NDA stuff its time for me to get a new PC.</p>

            <p>Those indeed are very nice graphics, especially the weather scene, looks VERY realistic, if Source 2 is to be anything like that, I will be pleased, but I’m doubtful.</p>
