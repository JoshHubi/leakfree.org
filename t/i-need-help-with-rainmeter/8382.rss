    <title>I need help with Rainmeter!!!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-need-help-with-rainmeter/8382</link>
    <description>So today I decided to download Rainmeter, and I ran into a bit of a problem. I already tried Reddit and asked around to my friends, and I&#39;ve still had no luck. So I decided that I might as well ask here.
Theres no major issue to be seen, really. I just start up Rainmeter, and it works perfectly fine. But then, after about a minute or so, I go to use it, and it stops responding. No error, it just fails.
I&#39;ve tried Rainmeter 2.2 and 2.1, and I&#39;m running Windows 7, 32-bit.
I could really, really use some help. Thanks!</description>

<p>Ah, right, sorry. I did, in fact, go to the forums there for help. But the verification e-mail for a new account is taking quite a while to go through. So still, any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
