<p>Yeah, Max Payne had awesome quotes, you aren’t supposed to take everything literally. The whole vibe the narration sent of gave me goosebumps. Jdowny, you didn’t really need to explain, but i guess to clear things up, it helped.</p>

<p>Aye, maybe. It wasn’t really directed at everyone else, because they seemed to understand it. It was just Phil. Every man to his own though. Also, I love how everyone still refers to me as JDowny.</p>

            <p>“Here at the enrichment center we believe: If at first you don’t succeed. You fail.” - Portal</p>
<p>“My life for Auir! I-I-I mean; Ner zhul…” - Warcraft 3<br>
“This is not Warcraft commander!” / “I KNOW IT’S NOT 3D!” - Startcraft B/W</p>
<p>“That was left handed” / “I got a present for you!” - C&amp;C 1 (1 hit KO a troop / C4 a building) Both with the GDI commando XD</p>
<p>Pretty much everything from The House of the Dead series, most notably:<br>
“He’s in the collesium, at the <span class="bbcode-u">EAST</span> side of the city!”<br>
“Heh. Heh. Heh. Dogs of the AMS…Tiiiime theymadeamove.”<br>
"Thank you for rescuing me :3 " It’s more funny to watch a guy say that, a bloody zombie would be raping them with mouldy cocks and trying to gouge their eyes out, you kill it and they have the sweetest manners and the calmest attitude you can find in a person.<br>
From OverKill: “So what’s your plan, agent Genius?” (The character practically hates the agent G and is constantly shouting at him and swearing, and takes the piss out of no-one knowing what agent “G” stands for)</p>
<p>“Gordon! Step away from the beam!” XD XD XD</p>

            <p>Not meaning to double post, but the Max Payne arguement thing, I honestly think the noir style and how cheesy everything was diologe wise made it 4x better to have fun with. Made me feel like those old narrating private eyes.</p>

            <p>Yeah, Max Payne had awesome quotes, you aren’t supposed to take everything literally. The whole vibe the narration sent of gave me goosebumps. Jdowny, you didn’t really need to explain, but i guess to clear things up, it helped.</p>
<p>“Max Payne will continue his journey through the night”</p>
<p>Ah man…</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Woah, sorry for the bump. And all I did was rant.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Labyrinths, minotaurs, ferrymen and rivers in Hades,…oh my. Labyrinths and Hades have nothing to do with each other of course, aside from the trivial fact that they are both drawn randomly from Greek mythology. This one is even more confused by the fact that Charon was the <span class="bbcode-i">name</span> of the ferryman, not the name of the ferry.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You clearly have no appreciation or understanding for that sort of writing. Besides being very tongue in cheek in places, a lot of the metaphors do work. A lot of the humour in that game was very subtle, but you can be sure that it was there. A game as dark as Max Payne needed that humour.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>the trivial fact that they are both drawn randomly from Greek mythology</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re trying to make it seem more inconsequential than it is. They aren’t drawn randomly from Greek mythology, nor is that trivial. I can’t really see anything wrong with that specific quote, unless you really wish to take <span class="bbcode-i">everything</span> literally and seriously. The dockyard was like a labyrinth. In Greek mythology, the labyrinth housed the Minotaur. He says that no Minotaur lurks at the centre, but it is implied that the skipper of the Charon was waiting in his stead. The Charon is the name of the cargo ship, as well as the name of the ferryman who ferries people to Hades (see comparison of skipper to the ferryman of Styx). Hades, Charon and the Minotaur are all elements of Greek mythology, thus you have your connection and the metaphor comes full circle. MP is also filled with elements of mythology and connections with the devil and the underworld, so the theme of Greek mythology and its underworld is highly pertinent and beneficial. If you can’t understand that or did understand that but weren’t capable of extending your thought capabilities beyond the literal, then it’s clearly not a style that you will enjoy.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Hint: a simile should help illustrate your ideas to the reader: no-one knows what a point-blank shot to the face feels like, so using it to explain how the feeling hit you doesn’t really help.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But surely you can imagine it? You don’t need to understand how <span class="bbcode-i">everything</span> feels in order to fully appreciate a similie. I’ve never been shot, but I can imagine that it would be damn painful to say the least. I’ve never been shot with a diamond bullet right through the forehead either, but it worked for Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now and no one complained. There are many things that I haven’t experienced, but that doesn’t lessen my appreciation of similies.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>What? Walk-in fridges are <span class="bbcode-i">literally</span> cold. Guns are not. So was it literally cold or not?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Guns are metal. Metal is usually cold. It’s a simple connection. Admittedly this isn’t one of the best similies - it’s overdramatic, tongue-in-cheek and almost trying too hard, but it’s far more over the top to try and describe Max Payne’s writing as a lesson in how ‘not to write.’ If that’s how you feel, I definitely wouldn’t read Raymond Chandler or ever watch Apocalypse Now or any film noir or indeed any good film with a good script and narration.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, but that really grated me. If I was cruel, I’d push the point too far by pointing out that grating is a metaphor and then describe the connection in an over-simplified manner, but I won’t. Sorry Phil, bad day.</p>
<p>Here are some awesome ones instead:</p>
<p>[b]- Collecting evidence had gotten old a few hundred bullets back. I was already so far past the point-of-no-return I couldn’t remember what it had looked like when I had passed it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sure thing, Jim. Me and the boys been talking, and everyone’s real sorry. They’ll never do it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn’t like the way the show started, but they had given me the best seat in the house, front row center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I felt like the chair I had broken to get free.[/b]</p>
