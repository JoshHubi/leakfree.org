    <title>GPU and PSU question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gpu-and-psu-question/5222</link>
    <description>Some time within the next six months I am going to get a new GPU.  My current build is running integrated graphics and believe it or not ran playable enough to last me about a year, but I just can&#39;t stand it anymore.  

I&#39;m not sure what kind of budget I am going to have.  I don&#39;t know a lot about Power Supplies but I do know that they are very important (not the kinda thing you always want to go cheap on).  Here is my issue,  my PC currently has only 300 watt power supply.  Well I am pretty sure its got enough leeway to sustain a Mobo powered graphics card, I am wondering at what budget would I get better performance out of buying both a PSU and a GPU over just a Mobo powered GPU?

Here are my specs

Really what I am looking for here is best performance boost over budget.  I&#39;m not sure exactly what kind of budget I will have but I highly doubt I am going to be able to spend more then $150 and even that much is unlikely.  

(I&#39;m not really looking to OC [that is even if I can with an HP] so don&#39;t take that as a factor, I don&#39;t have the money for better cooling  :stuck_out_tongue: )</description>

            <p>I should clarify, the GPU is the more inportant part.  I’m trying to ask should I buy just a Graphics card or a graphics card and a power supply.  Its kinda hard to phrase it right.  I guess a good example would be, would it be better to buy a 60$ GPU and a 60$ PSU (or a 80$ and 40$ or whatever) or be limited to cards that have low power supply requirements and just get a Graphics card.  The part I am most concerned about is the GPU not the PSU.  But going on newegg a lot of them req at least like 400 watt power supply and I know over doing you PSU can have bad effects.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I am making this clear <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

            <p>Modular power supplies are much more expensive though… If your case is large enough you shouldn’t have problems finding a place to tuck the cables in. But if you find a modular PSU that fits your budget, go for it.</p>
<p>Edit: By the way, I don’t claim to provide expert advice, this is just my opinion  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> .</p>

            <p>Depends what kind of gaming you want to do with it, but my machine has a Radeon 4670 GPU, and it runs most games fine. And this card can cost you about 80$ maybe. And I think you wouldn’t even need to upgrade your power supply with it. My machine currently runs on a 250W power supply (I had upgraded to a 400W in the past, but it died, so I put the old original back in) and it works fine.<br>
Overall, you can get a very decent GPU for about 100$. And you can probably get a power supply of ~400-600W for 50-60$. Look around for deals… <a href="http://newegg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">newegg.com</a> sometimes has deals that can save you 30-40%, check often for the Shell Shocker thing (new deal every 12 hours). I bought my whole new PC from there, mostly with shell shocker deals  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  (I’m going to Purolator after work to pick up my last parts, and I should be able to build it tonight, yay!)</p>

            <p>A 600W PSU should be enough. Buy something mid-range, not too cheap nor too expensive.</p>
<p>Edit: make sure it provides all the connections you need and at least a couple of connectors for graphic cards.</p>
