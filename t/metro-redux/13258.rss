            <p>Own both versions and have played through both. Metro redux is a big change from the original all the features of LL used to good effect. Great buy for $12.00</p>

<p>A REDUX release to improve things, and it’s missing a major visual feature that was IN the original… Absolutely, incredibly sad.</p>
<p>“August 28, 2014 - Metro Redux – First Update Adds Volumetric Lights Exclusively To The PC Version”</p>
<p>“… the recently released Metro: Redux was lacking almost all volumetric lights that were present in the original version of Metro 2033. Today, 4A Games and Deep Silver released a 1.2GB patch for the PC version of Metro: Redux that brings a number of them back to the game.”</p>
<p>“… though there are still places in which volumetric lights have not been added/used.”, simply ludicrous.</p>

            <p>I played through Last Light again recently and forgot how much I loved the series, so when I found out about this, I preordered it. $25 is a small price to pay for two awesome games that have better optimization (at least 2033 does, for sure, I haven’t played LL Redux yet). I’m enjoying 2033 a lot more than I did before, especially because I usually get a constant 60 fps unless shit gets REALLY busy on screen. It’s not as atmospheric, in certain ways, sure, but it by no means makes it a bad game. The gunplay is LL level, as in WAY better than in the original 2033, plus being able to buy attachments and customize your weapons like in LL is a welcome addition, imo. Better than having to randomly happen upon a weapon with an extended barrel or a silencer.</p>
<p>Also if you don’t want to get the Last Light Redux because you don’t want to rebuy a game you’ve only had for a year, you <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> just buy 2033 redux, if you’re on PC.</p>

<p>…Isn’t that intentional? Hence why the game has a flashlight and night vision goggles?</p>

            <p>I’ve really been enjoying Redux. I played Last Light first originally and found 2033 to be a lot less polished when I did play it. There were times where you couldn’t really see much of anything and the stealth game play suffered pretty badly from it also it ran worse than last light for me. 2033 redux has fixed this and overall feels really polished compared to what it was. You can also still launch the original games from steam if you buy Redux.</p>

<p>Holy shit</p>
<p>I mean I know this sort of thing is usually subjective</p>
<p>but light is a real thing</p>
<p>and Redux’s is more accurate</p>
<p>not only is 2033’s original lighting worse</p>

            <p>Well, guys, I have seen the game-play video of the Metro 2033 Redux, and was disappointed by the visual side of the " upgraded version". Lighting did not look any better, and the models like in the Metro Last Light just look in that title to me too toy-sh, worse than the ones in the Metro 2033 (I have played the game from start to finish several times, and like it’s visual side more than that of Metro Last Light). The game was released not that long ago, and I wonder what you guys think of it.</p>

            <p>If you ask me, the Redux seems to add too many colors.<br>
The atmosphere in the original have a different vibe to it than the well lit and colorful Redux version.<br>
I will probably prefer to play the original at horrible framerate rather than this. But I do like that they’ve removed all that dust and fog. Though, I would have liked if they left some of it.</p>
<p>Is it just me or do some of the new NPC models look bad? Can you honestly call the changes showed at 0.48 as an upgrade?</p>
<p>And no, I haven’t played last light.</p>

            <p>we’ll just have to see how much they enhanced the graphics and performance in both games, by the look of those screenies of 2033, they basically ported over alot of Last Light assets (those reich soldiers look more distinct and less like generic stalker soldiers that are seen everywhere)</p>
<p>i have reason to believe they will even make the game harder as they divided the LL and 2033 playstyles into “Spartan” and “Survival” modes<br>
maybe Survival Ranger Hardcore mode will be downright hardest ever</p>
<p>hope to see more screenshot comparisons</p>

<p>Metro Last Light is almost exactly 1 year old, and I need to buy it again because the version I have isn’t optimized very well? Seems a bit odd…I can see paying for 2033, but I’ve only owned LL for about 4 months, because I didn’t buy it at release. Wish I woulda known this was in the works, or else I would have just waited.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is how I see it too.</p>
<p>I mean I’ve had them both less than a year and haven’t played either (Have a backlog of games to complete…), but if what I’ve seen and heard about 2033 is true, I’d be happy to repurchase a heavily graphically updated, optimised and overall improved version.<br>
Last Light though? Paying for that is a push. I haven’t owned it for very long either.</p>
<p>I do personally wish the 50% off was a ‘forever’ kind of deal, rather than just pre-purchases for owners of the original copies, but I guess people would say that’s me being cheap or something.</p>

            <p>50% off to existing owners of the games on Steam.</p>
<p>The cynic in me says that’s still a bit expensive for re-buying games I already have but on the other hand these guys deserve all the money they ask for.</p>

            <p>I own 2033 and LL and still haven’t played them, I should get on to that…</p>
<p>It is really nice to update/improve past games, especially good ones. Stuff like Black Mesa or the HL2 update thing on Facepunch really capture my interest.</p>
