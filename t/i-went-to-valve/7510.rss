    <title>I Went to Valve!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-went-to-valve/7510</link>
    <description>For this high school dealy, I had to check out a prospective job. I live in the Seattle area, and obviously any excuse to get into the Valve offices is a good excuse, so I called &#39;em up. I got a tour of the offices.
They didn&#39;t make me sign anything, so I guess I&#39;m allowed to tell anyone I want about the stuff I saw? There&#39;s no such thing as an implied NDA, is there? They never even said, like, &quot;Now don&#39;t tell anyone about this!&quot; So whatever.

The point is... And the reason I&#39;m posting this in the Half-Life Series forum... They were in the middle of remodeling when I visited the office, and there was a [i]lot[/i] of concept art just kind of... spread around. In, like, big stacks and piles. Most of it was for Dota 2, and there was a little bit for some weird Team Fortress 2 stuff that I didn&#39;t understand because I don&#39;t really play Team Fortress 2 (and one big ol&#39; picture that JUST had the word MAGICKA on it, but I dunno what that means), but there were also four or five that I&#39;m reasonably certain were Ep3/HL3 concept art.

There were a couple other ones like the one we&#39;ve already seen, with the sort of jagged metal edges, but they were darker, with a blue tint instead of a green one, and were kind of... more cramped. Like they were of smaller areas? These ones were pretty nondescript and I was kind of being rushed through those parts of the office.

The one that really caught my eye, though, was a wide-shot picture of the ocean with a ship floating in it. I mean, it obviously wasn&#39;t TF2 or Dota, so I&#39;m pretty sure it was the Borealis, but what circumstance would put the Borealis back in the water?

I guess concept art isn&#39;t really that concrete of a source, plus the fact that you&#39;re hearing it from a teenager on the internet. And clearly my recollection really isn&#39;t all that helpful. But it&#39;s nice to know that the next Half Life game is being actively worked on!</description>

            <p>Well, going back to the OP, I’m glad you got to accomplish something like this. I can’t  imagine how nervous you would’ve been! I personally would have never thought of actually requesting a visit to Valve HQ, it’s amazing they actually agreed.</p>
<p>Did you happen to see the 1:1 TF2 sentry they have? I’ve seen videos, they’re pretty cool  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Obviously the Borealis would be floating in the water. And yeah…it would be pretty much accidental. If the ship was floating…it may be an existing picture that valve has already created. (The scientists standing next to the floating Borealis) Or it would be floating in Lake Michigan or Erie. They may have attempted to teleport it to the assisted jaunt center in Cleveland and failed.</p>

<p>Well, considering the thing suposedly teleported from the drydock to the middle of the Antarctic I’m not under the impression it’s the most predictable of teleporters.</p>
<p>What if it were teleported to the middle of the ocean, sank and whilst that happens the teleporter turns on to the combine home world. FLOOD!</p>
<p>That would either be so cool or so damn retarded I can’t make up my mind.</p>

            <p>the reason episode 3 isn’t out or announced yet is because, well, ITS NOT DONE. if the game was done valve would’ve told us something. maybe they are developing a new engine, multiplayer, or maybe HL3. remember if it is taking this long valve thinks it isn’t good enough to release. and thats that until its done. same with black mesa <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Well they have diffrent floors for different games, and when I went there for a tour they said they were building another floor.

            <p>Stargazing belly-floppers eroticized me while i walked by slowly, despite my having springs.<br>
Suddenly, several radishes burst through holding their roots, screaming<br>

<p>If you were going to teleport it at all, I doubt you would teleport it to the ocean. Why not teleport immediately to a certain rebel base.</p>
<p>I doubt it would leave the ice at all, if it’s even still frozen in ice. It would just be used or blown-up on the spot.</p>
