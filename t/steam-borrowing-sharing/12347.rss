            <p>Sweet I really hope this is true, I would love to be able to trade and share digital games. It’s one of the only things that digital games have ever really lacked. Plus it could actually help cut down piracy, or at least the perception of it. It’s so often said, “I only pirate to try games, and I buy the ones I like”. Well if your friend has it, now you could try it without risking piracy! And who knows, Valve could even set up some kind of system to lend you games for free directly from them for a limited time, giving you another way to demo the game.</p>
<p>And it would be absolutely AMAZING if you could actually trade games for steam wallet money or something. It’s so well known how many people buy games on a whim on Steam sales that it’s become a joke. How great would it be to turn shelved impulse buy games into credit to buy games you really want? Course that doesn’t seem to be implied at all and it’s more of wishful thinking based on some comments in that thread, but still…that would be great. <em>sighs</em></p>
