    <title>Underwater Textures</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/underwater-textures/11663</link>
    <description>Lets just get this out of the way first. I am well aware that I can fix this bug by switching to DirectX 9+. I am [b]unable[/b] to run DirectX9+ on my current computer for more than a minute or two without crashing the graphics card.
Now for the issue. I am currently stuck on Residue Processing at the first underwater section. Underwater, my screen becomes filled with 2 black and 2 purple squares because it fails to load a texture. I can not see where to go at all. Is there a way to disable/ remove said texture, or am I boned?
Computer specs. (Not that it matters too much in this case):
HP G42 Notebook PC
Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit
8GB RAM
AMD Turion II P520 Dual-Core Processor, 2300 Mhz, 2 Core, 2 Logical Processor
AMD M880G with ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250 Integrated Graphics Card</description>

            <p>I’m quite sure there’s no way to fix that besides DirectX 9+. Sorry.</p>
