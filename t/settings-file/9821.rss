    <description>I have a post in general Help and support but I felt I should have posted in this thread instead. My original thread:

[url]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=492647#post492647[/url]

I installed the game last night, to the correct default directory, loaded the game and went to change my resolution to the highest I could. Foolishly I think I set it to high and my game crashed. It continues to crash when I try to start the game. I can see the window appear briefly then disappear again. 

I have tried to reinstall the application and restart my system to no avail. I have a feeling there is a settings file installed somewhere that might let me change the resolution manually but i cant find it. I have also tried -window as a launch option.

Thank you.</description>

            <p>You could also remove -window and replace it with -autoconfig, which should set everything to there default system values.</p>

            <p>Try the launch options “+mat_forcehardwaresync 0 -dxlevel 90” (without quotes).</p>
<p>Also what are your system specs? (CPU, GPU, OS)</p>
