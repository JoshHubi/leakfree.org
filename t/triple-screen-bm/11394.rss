    <title>Triple screen BM</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/triple-screen-bm/11394</link>
    <description>Hi all, just registered and firstly I&#39;d like to say what a truly awesome job you guys have done here. The game feels like Half Life. So often with these updates the game no longer feels the same but this really does. The level of detail is amazing. 

I dont know whether you have tried to run this with triple screen but just FYI my setup of three 23in monitors runs BM perfectly fine with only a slight glitch where the edge of the walls can clip through but this is also present in HL &amp; HL2.</description>

            <p>Try changing your Field-Of-View, using this command:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">fov</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">fov &lt;VALUE&gt;</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> Replace  with any (valid) value, between 55 and 115.</p>

<p>You may want to experiment with it a little, to find which setting fits best.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
