    <title>Moa Tse Tung</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/moa-tse-tung/3991</link>
    <description>I am just going through a biography on Mao Tse Tung. 

I admit I know little about him, but am getting there. What I do not understand, is how someone as vicious as he was, could possible have made it to power. Yes, he used propaganda, but still... He was known liar, careless murderer and only interested in Moa, not his country - Or at least, it seems that way.

Moscow played a huge role in communism taking hold in China.

So, I suppose I am not so much debating per say, because I am an unarmed opponent in this case. What I am after, are some perspectives on Moa, and perhaps a discussion concerning Communism in general. From what I can tell of it, it is an inherently brutal form of government, but could it work as intended?

Any thoughts folks?</description>

            <p>The only Mao I like is the card game.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The card game Mao is a game where you can only know the rules through the powers of observation and trial-and-error.  The playing rules, however, are always kept secret.</p>

<p>EDIT* Sorry Bigfan, I retract my former comments. I get you now</p>

<p>Oh, I am learning about him as I go, but am baffled how these sorts of people are able to gain that kind of power. There were several times where his life was in danger, but he always seemed to escape. He lied and killed his way to top of the stack and was obviously, unconventional. Not thinking like the rest of the pack helped him for sure - I suppose it is the cost that OTHERS paid for his success that amazes me. Surely humanity being the motivator is best?</p>

            <p>I’m sure you can find out how Mao got to power and what happened when he did.  He used propaganda such as going after the elites who were oppressing them from afar.  In turn, he became the oppressor.</p>
<p>Any pure economic system, be it communism, socialism, capitalism or corporatism works well on paper, but not in practice.  We need a mixture of all.  No one in power in the United States is advocating anything close to either communism or socialism (though that’s certainly not stopping those that use propaganda such as going after the elites who say they are being oppressed from afar).</p>
