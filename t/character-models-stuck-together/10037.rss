    <title>Character models stuck together</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/character-models-stuck-together/10037</link>
    <description>In the last map in Office Complex my two guards got stuck together. It started after I got through the cooler room, and went back to get the two plus one scientist. I managed to separate them though. I just told one of them to wait and had the other one follow me. After I got some space between them, I just told the first one to follow again. And then we all had a very productive day.
