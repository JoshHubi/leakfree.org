<p>Nah.  I’ve seen movies ranging from Passion of the Christ (:facepalm <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> , the Watchmen (:|), the Evil Dead “trilogy” ( <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ), Dead Alive ( <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ), Blair Witch Project (:pffft <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> , and thousands of other movies.</p>
<p>Again, District 9 is the only movie that was the only movie that actually made me ill.</p>
<p>Or maybe it was the movie theater food.</p>

            <p>Excellent movie and I will almost certainly buy the DVD. I don’t see why there’s so much dislike for the shaky cam. This movie’s camera was nowhere near as bad as the Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield and it amazes me how many people get motionsick from movies.</p>
<p>The CGI was amazing for such a small budget and the action was awesome. The thing I found strange was that the aliens (especially Christopher) were way more likable than the humans. When they had Christopher on the ground and were about to shoot him I was on the edge of my seat screaming “No, don’t do it!” . If they make a sequel there’s no question that I’ll go see it.</p>

            <p>I watched this at home and didn’t get sick. Maybe you just had some bad snack at the theatre. Or the huge screen amasses you.</p>
<p>Well… yes I realise this thread is old, but if people still want to talk about it why not?<br>
It’s not like any of the other threads in Raminator’s Ladies club is more important.</p>

            <p>Ram, we know what it does and how that functions, but we dont know why.<br>
We dont know why things are pulled in. Sure general relativity, but why does it do that?</p>
<p>One theory is gravitrons, particles that would cause it. Gravity isnt fully explained.</p>

            <p>Also the exoskeleton had a gravity gun like thing, but that concept isn’t new either. Star wars did it before Half-Life 2 and probably some other books/movies too which I don’t know about.</p>
<p>That has been mankinds dream for a long time to be able to cheat gravity. It’s one of the forces that hasn’t been completely explained yet either.</p>

            <p>yeah, the aliens were similar to Vortigonts in HL2 they also had arms coming out of the stomach region.</p>
<p>Then again I’m not saying the movie is inspired by Half-Life as that is most likely not true. It’s is more correct to say that all sci-fi draws inspiration from each other and you find certain concepts in every sci-fi movie. This is just limitation of human imagination. It’s hard to come up with something brand new that doesn’t look or feel similar to something else. The only way to truly get something original is to find alien lifeforms for real, but we have not done that yet so we can’t know for certain what it looks like.</p>
<p>District 9 was a bit slow moving, and I kinda hated the protagonist for being such a pussy and weak person. He could have stood up for himself a bit more. He had a management role after all. I would certainly never have hired him like that.</p>
<p>Effects were nice, and the exoskeleton/mech thing was how it was. Sure they could have made it seem more real, but what is real? Is that making the machinery look more like what humans would have created? this was alien tech after all. You could say the same about the alien weaponry.</p>
<p>bad spelling I know.</p>

            <p>When it comes to biology, I really think there’s more Dr. Who reference than Half-Life reference.</p>
<p><a href="https://img402.imageshack.us/img402/8720/oodpa468x693.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></a></p>
<p>Then again, you could say the same drew inspiration from illithids. But Oodkind were cut off and enslaved in a similar fashion, so there may be more of a relationship than one would think.</p>

            <p>D9 seems cool and at last, mankind seems to be the bad guys.<br>
HL2 reference ? Aliens general morphology similar to vorts, nothing else.</p>

            <p>On the robot topic, shouldn’t it be considered a mech, as it has a human pilot?</p>
