Apple is apparently ramping up its battle to prevent iPhone and iPod owners from jailbreaking their devices.

The company has applied for a patent, titled &quot;Systems and Methods for Identifying Unauthorized Users of an Electronic Device,&quot; that covers a series of security measures to automatically protect devices from thieves and other &quot;unauthorized users.&quot; 

The application, which was filed in February 2009 and published Thursday, describes measures to identify &quot;particular activities that may indicate suspicious behavior,&quot; so that &quot;safety measures&quot; can be taken to restrict the device&#39;s functions. Those activities include the &quot;hacking, jailbreaking, unlocking, or removal of a SIM card,&quot; according to the application.

<p>Yes, the <a href="https://www.htc.com/nl/product/desire/overview.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HTC Desire</a>.  It runs Android 2.2, has a 1ghz processor, 3.7" AMOLED touch screen (800x480 pixels), 576 MB RAM memory, 4 GB internal SD card, wireless network support, bluetooth support, a five megapixel camera… the list goes on.</p>
<p>Rumor has it there’s also a buffed up version of the HTC Desire coming out in october, the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/8301-19736_1-20010704-251.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HTC Desire HD</a>. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>The HTC Droid Incredible is technically a lot like the HTC Desire, exclusive to Verizon Wireless customers.  Enabling a smartphone as a wireless router is a feature of Android 2.2, it is supported by every device running Android 2.2 I think.  The HTC Desire supports it as well.</p>

<p>I dislike smart phones so I don’t know too many details. I like my cell phones to do 2 things send/receive texts and send/receive calls anything more is just overkill I like having my music not on my phone, and on a device without speakers built-in becuase i know no-one else wants to hear my music, kids with iphones/itouchs don’t seem to know that. makes me wanna break every iphone/itouch ever.</p>

<p>Oh i agree, i no way do i do it to get at Apple. I respect Apple. My iPhone is jailbroken however, because its an old 1st gen, with an orange sim card, it has to be jailbroken to work. I also have loaded on some custom firmware to mimic the features of IOS4, such as multitasking. I don’t do it for pirating. My phone actually doesn’t really have my apps on it, i’m not big on apps or games.</p>

</aside>
<p>A little bit offtopic, but that’s a very strange thing to say.  The quantity of people your survey only serves to fine-tune the results of the survey.  What’s much more important is how the people participating in your survey reflect all the iPhone/iPod owners.</p>
<p>If you find 100 people who are a perfect reflection of all the iPhone/iPod owners, your survey will conclude the same as the survey that interviews all of them, with a 1% error margin.  That said, of course there are no details provided about <span class="bbcode-i">how</span> the survey came together, so there is no way to know if the numbers are correct.</p>
<p>If you Google for recent surveys about the subject, you’ll find one says ‘more than 8%’, another one says ‘close to 10%’… I guess the truth is somewhere along those lines.</p>

<p>As a big fan of <a href="https://www.eff.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">digital freedom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">open source software</a>, I cannot for the life of me understand why people would want a smartphone (read: computer), where you are not in control of what you do with it.  It’s a bit like owning and living in the house of your dreams, but not being able to decide which friends you invite for dinner. Or like buying a TV, and then the salesman tells you “Oh, by the way - you can’t watch SyFy because I don’t like it”.</p>

<p>First, i doubt  every single ipod/iphone user took part in this survey.</p>
<p>Second, WHAT? Jailbreaking isn’t all about free apps. (That’s just for the people who can’t afford two dollar games) Its about multi-tasking, looks, tweaking, and so much more. Of course, i respect your opinion, but would just like to offer to take a look at jailbroken devices. They’re really cool, and much more handy then stock devices.</p>

            <p>I don’t see how/why apple would go this far to prevent jail breaking devices (with the exception of stolen apps, and such).</p>
<p>The way i see it, this is helping sales(:<br>
…still… I don’t have on doubt in my mind that the new Ipod’s would be safely jailbroken by the enod the the first week that they come out d:</p>
<p>and i lol’d so hard at your comment tycho XD</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and not to mention, apple already steals idea’s from the features these jailbroken apps have to offer, in the stupidest, so they should be praising the apps a little the way i see it.</p>

<p>In some embodiments, an unauthorized user can be detected by comparing the identity of the current user to the identities of authorized users of the electronic device. For example, a photograph of the current user can be taken, a recording of the current user’s voice can be recorded, the heartbeat of the current user can be recorded, or any combination of the above. The photograph, recording, or heartbeat can be compared, respectively, to a photograph, recording, or heartbeat of authorized users of the electronic device to determine whether they match. If they do not match, the current user can be detected as an unauthorized user.</p>

<p>According to a 2009 <a href="https://www.ipodrepublic.com/ipod-review/jailbroken-iphone-or-ipod-touch/2009/05/14/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">survey</a> by the New York Times, only 6.7% of the devices are jailbroken.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t give a fuck about it. I enjoy my stock iPod Touch and the free/paid apps I have. Don’t see a reason to jailbreak it. And no “just to spite Apple” isn’t a reason.</p>

<p>Apple is apparently ramping up its battle to prevent iPhone and iPod owners from jailbreaking their devices.</p>
<p>The company has applied for a patent, titled “Systems and Methods for Identifying Unauthorized Users of an Electronic Device,” that covers a series of security measures to automatically protect devices from thieves and other “unauthorized users.”</p>
<p>The application, which was filed in February 2009 and published Thursday, describes measures to identify “particular activities that may indicate suspicious behavior,” so that “safety measures” can be taken to restrict the device’s functions. Those activities include the “hacking, jailbreaking, unlocking, or removal of a SIM card,” according to the application.</p>
