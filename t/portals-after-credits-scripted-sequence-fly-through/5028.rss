    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portals-after-credits-scripted-sequence-fly-through/5028</link>
    <description>Does anyone know a good well explained step by step guide on how to make your own little fly through? Or does anyone here know how to do so? Because I thought that was a really awesome flythrough, and I doubt that using this advanced player view_control will have the same effect as the scripted_sequence Valve had used. Any help would be highly appreciated.</description>

<p>Well, the point FOR this introduction is to give a short moment before playability for a verse of the poem “There will come soft rains” by Sara Teasdale. Right now im in the works of a short, maybe 7 labs in total, Portal mod that was inspired by actually not the poem, but the short story. If you have yet to read it, I would suggest so, it’s a awesome short story, and you should see the similarity between it and Portal. So yeah, it WILL be a short AMATEUR intro.</p>

<p>amazing what difference that a single apostrophe can make. He’s asking if anyone knows how to script a mod so that it takes over control of the camera and has it fly through a set path like what valve did at the end of portal where the camera went down the long winding corridor to a room with a cake in it, after the credits were over.</p>

            <p>Yup, that was real time. The Episode Two teaser video in Ep1’s postcredits was a .bink file, as was the recap at the beginning of ep2. Weirdly the engine had to reload after the bink file plays. I think it’s a coding limitation.</p>

<p>What I meant was basically what I think the above guy said. The player_view control is given an animation to follow around the area from outside of the engine.</p>

            <p>The way Valve did both the portal fly-through and the HL2 post Alyx wakeup is a prop_dynamic with the model set to “blackout.mdl.” Valve got this effect by using the entity in conjunction with a point_viewcontrol. The episode one Dog retrieval scene is a separate version of the entity. The wakeup and dog retrieval were designed to stop where the player initially regains control. I’m pretty sure the wakeup animation is obsolete as of the Episode Two SDK however, so don’t count on using it unless you can somehow port the old version of the entity back into the SDK.</p>

            <p>Thanks, and I guess I will stick to what I am currently working with, if anytime in the future someone does come across a tutorial for it, or if anyone who knows how they did it, would still be great. I will be adding the mod onto ModDB here soon, I dont want to get on there empty handed.</p>

            <p>IF you use view_control, make sure you do it GOOD, and by that I mean make it as well-planned and well-executed as the professional ones.  Also, make it SHORT because obviously you won’t even come close to living up to the professionals, so you may as well minimize the suffering of whoever is playing your map.</p>
<p>Moral of the story:  Amateur scripted intros are NEVER good.</p>

            <p>Thanks Jeff, ill give it a look, though im sure it is also the view_control. I have yet to even finish up testing with it, but I was curious as how Valve had done it at the end of Portal, and saw that it was completely different than the way I was expecting it to be done.</p>

<p>amazing what difference that a single apostrophe can make. He’s asking if anyone knows how to script a mod so that it takes over control of the camera and has it fly through a set path like what valve did at the end of portal where the camera went down the long winding corridor to a room with a cake in it, after the credits were over.</p>

            <p>Does anyone know a good well explained step by step guide on how to make your own little fly through? Or does anyone here know how to do so? Because I thought that was a really awesome flythrough, and I doubt that using this advanced player view_control will have the same effect as the scripted_sequence Valve had used. Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>
