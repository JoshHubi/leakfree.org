    <title>My computer turns off</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-computer-turns-off/11743</link>
    <description>I would love to get a screen shot, but the game is just not cooperating. 

I just downloaded the game yesterday. I am running windows 7. I have an intell iii. I have set my affinity to run on all 4 processors as I have read on this forum.

Anyhoo, the first 3 times I ran this game, It froze on the train ride on the first bend. On the 4th time, I made it all the way to Barney opening the door. He opened the big door for me, I walked into the main area where Barney is at the computer having troubles. And then, my laptop turned off. Just powered right off.

I did it again, this time, the guard commented on the no pony tail, he went to open the door and my computer turned off again.

Any idea what&#39;s wrong? I&#39;ll try to get a screen shot and some system info...but there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary game wise, there&#39;s no warning, no stuttering or slow down, it just turns off. As in, I have to hit the power, boot, log in to windows etc.

I&#39;ll be thankful for any help. I&#39;m a huge HL fan and I&#39;ve been very excited for this mod for years.

Cheers,
-Sean</description>

            <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Apparently, I needed a second coffee.  My lap top was turning off because it was overheating.  I’m well aware of that, but never even thought to think about that this morning  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">   Anyhoo, a can of spray air and a cooling pad for my lap top later and I’m fighting head crabs and vorgons.</p>
