            <p>Welp, I think I know where this bullshit came from.  I’m a member of the social news/democratic news site Reddit, and they had a series of BM-related posts recently in their Gaming forum.  In fact, it was a pic from an older media release.  It appears that this got oversimplified and posted into “news”.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9k1g9/awesome_tiein_from_the_black_mesa_source_mod_to/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here’s that</a> posting on Reddit.</p>

<p>It’s not that big of deal… Atleast you corrected your mistake. Plus it’s not like you had a condescending tone towards the mod or what you thought they might be doing, you were just reporting what you thought it might be. You sound as excited about the mod as the rest of us.</p>

<p>…but its the little details like this and the high-level of work that’s going into it that makes it just as good as anything Valve could have made themselves.</p>

            <p>It’s a fair assumption to make, but the idea behind the inclusion of them is that the heelsprings appear to be common technology within the Half-Life universe, used by Chell in Portal, featured on the legs of the Combine Assassin which was eventually cut from Half-Life 2 and Eli sporting a similar looking contraption as a replacement for his leg. Even in reality we have a similar device that has been adopted as an extreme sport akin to skating, rollerblading etc.<br>

<p>This is the trouble with internet news sites, and most news reporting in general the last few years. No one tries to verify their story by contacting the people involved anymore. If they had simply emailed you, or stopped by the forums for a quick search, they could have squashed the rumor right in their article. But instead they went for sock and posted the initial rumor as if it were fact just to get views on their site without any care for the facts of the matter.</p>

<p>I checked everywhere but the forums here and I kind of wish I had now.</p>
<p>I’m now going to read this forum from start to finish before I dare post anything about this mod on my site.</p>

            <p>At least the bloke apologized.  For that I am happy to cease making fun of it.   Anyone got a rope to help pull him out of the steaming pile?</p>

            <p>Update to their article!</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>[Update] I just wanted to say that this was just a theory that looked sound to me so I reposted it here.    It now looks like this theory is completely and utterly wrong and that I am some kind of idiot for believing in it.</p>
<p>Because of my mistake there is already a campaign running at Black Mesa HQ for me to <span class="bbcode-b">’simmer in my own crapola’</span>.  I can only hope that otheres will learn from my mistakes and ask the Black Mesa guys first before posting.</p>
<p>I am truly sorry.</p>
<p>[/Update]</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>HAHAHAHA you tell em’ Catz !   I didn’t realize that we were organizing a campaign, though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> . That was a quick update, Catz posted only 2 hours ago… Is the article writer a frequent forum lurker or cockroach on the forums, or did someone write him a nasty letter?</p>
<p>In any case he seems to have read this page once already, if you are still reading, or to anyone else lurking on the forums, Please read the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=24" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Faqs</a> Stickied to the top of the cafeteria page. It will answer a lot of questions and make your life a whole lot easier…</p>

I say let the article stand without a response from the fanbase or the developers.  They didnt come here to check their facts first, so let them simmer in their own crapola.</p>
