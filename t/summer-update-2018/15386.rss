[b][u]Summer Sale[/u][/b]
Hope everyone is having a great summer. Black Mesa is now on sale for 60% off! It’s a GREAT time to pick up the game at a discounted price  :wink:  

[url=&#39;https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/&#39;][img]https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8672783/2e37aea759e0823e7002ee6664946e92ef072b2a.jpg[/img][/url]

[b][u]Xen[/u][/b]
There has been lots of progress on Xen. We have started external playtesting. The first two chapters, &quot;Xen&quot; and &quot;Gonarch&#39;s Lair&quot;, clock in around two hours. For reference, all five chapters of Xen in HL1 can be completed in approximately one hour! We are really excited to show our work to everyone, but we also want to save the majority of Xen as a surprise.

Here is a brief breakdown of our current progress in each chapter:

[u]Xen - [i]Final Polish[/i][/u]
We have locked the majority of the Xen levels. Most of the design and art is completed, and we are polishing one or two rough edges in the design.

[u]Gonarch’s Lair - [i]Art[/i][/u]
As you can see, we have a good amount of art completed for Gonarch. We are doing some last minute design revisions to get the gameplay tight and consistent throughout the chapter, and then we can drop in our already created art. As you might guess, this chapter is very heavy on code and animation. The first map is locked, the second map is finishing its main art pass, and the final map is undergoing some design iterations, with some art already implemented.

[u]Interloper - [i]Final Gameplay[/i][/u]
This chapter has gone through a hefty number of positive and ambitious design revisions since we started it. We are really happy with the direction and iterations that have gone in, for all five maps. They are very close to gameplay complete, and are playable start to finish. We are currently finishing the modular art pieces, trimming some of the chapter’s “fat”, and polishing the last of the rough design edges to produce a streamlined and action-packed conclusion to Xen’s main story.

As Interloper is a significant departure from the rest of Xen, our intention is to get Xen and Gonarch’s Lair completed through the final polish stages first, before shifting the entire team onto Interloper at once, to finish this chapter up in one quick fell swoop.

[u]Nihilanth - [i]Gameplay/Art[/i][/u]
The art for this level is completed. Without giving too much more away, we have a really exciting evolution for this chapter, and we are starting the final push to get this chapter completely coded, scripted, and animated.

[u]Endgame - [i]Final Polish[/i][/u]
This chapter is locked. There are some dependency assets and some polish we have to implement once the rest of the game is complete, but other than that, it is ready to go.

[b][u]Multiplayer Playdate - 6-30-18[/u][/b]
The Black Mesa devs are getting together for a play date on on Saturday June 30th at 12:00 PM EST (midday). We are looking forward to filling some servers, blowing off some steam, and having a good time.
[img=&#39;https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8672783/09dd2ea30fc563bd3b9a2cd6c308e50030c03a68.jpg&#39;,none,600][/img]

[b][u]Celebrating 20 Years of Half-Life[/u][/b]
Oh cool, so it’s already JUNE. Time flies when you are [s]grinding toward a deadline[/s] having fun. As many of you are probably already aware, Half-Life will be [b]TWENTY[/b] this November. We obviously plan on doing some BIG THINGS to celebrate the game that inspired us and became such a huge part of all our lives.

One of the events planned is Black Mesa (Crowbar Collective) having a booth at Syracuse’s [url=&#39;https://retrogamecon.com/&#39;]Retro Game Con[/url] November 3rd and 4th. Stop by if you are in the area and chat with us. I went last year as a guest and had a great time (and got some sweet video game themed magnets too). More info on this event to come.

We are also considering doing a dev marathon stream of Black Mesa, Half-Life 2, Episode 1, and Episode 2. Would anyone be interested in watching us do that? We would have to figure out the logistics, as we are all not in one place, but that is something that sounds like a good time to us.

There are some other big ideas we would really like to do, but can’t talk about just yet. If you have any ideas, please let us know!</description>

            <p>frustration caused by countless delays of xen might have caused an effect of frustration in some users, which causes quarels, and that only makes me dislike this forum more. IMHO, you guys wouldn’t argue if expressing these frustrations weren’t considered a toxicity by some.</p>
<p>Also, why do we even have a dislike option here? Just to make people angry, and hate each other?</p>

<p>So, I should ignore the years long forum internet tradition of calling out folks and their easily predictable responses. As in the last bunches of replies. Their dislikes are  as predictable as republican hate mongering.</p>

<p>1: No, It is highly relevant as you are the only person here mentioning banning me. So maybe laying off the mini-modding.<br>
2: maybe consider the fact that as of me writing this, you are the only person who is so angry at me replying that you post full of grammatical and spelling errors. Let me suggest meditation and yoga to clear your mind and calm you, thus lessening your anger at random internet denizens with fake names<br>
3: If you do not swallow it, hook line and sinker, can it truly be bait?</p>
