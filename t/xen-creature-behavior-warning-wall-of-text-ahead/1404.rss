    <title>Xen Creature behavior (warning, wall of text ahead)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xen-creature-behavior-warning-wall-of-text-ahead/1404</link>
    <description>One thing I&#39;m abit curious about, is the relationship between the different species which was mostly ignored in the original half lfie 1 (this is just about the the barnacles, headcrabs, bullsquids and houndeyes).

as we all know a certain part of Xen forces only contained wild animals, they all seemed like happy friends in half life 1 (apart from bullsquids being loners and attacking their relatives aswell as hunting headcrabs).

In Half Life 2 however it was clearly shown that their are extremely agressive towards each other (like barnacles eating headcrabs, which they havent done in Half life 1)

If you take into acccount, that all these 4 species (as named above) are carnivors, some additonal things would happen:


1.) as seen in Half Life 2 Headcrabs don&#39;t fear to attack larger animals (antlions), so i find it safe to assume that they would attack species of the same size during the black mesa incident aswell (like houndeyes for example)

2.) barnacles eat pretty much everything they can get their tongue on, and considering they can eat a human they should also be able to attack other species of the same size.

3.) The relationship between bullsquids and houndeyes seems also unclear to me, I&#39;m pretty shure a bullsquid would not fear to attack them

if you wondering why I&#39;m asking this, certain gamepaly scenes scenes during Half Life 1 would change quite alot if the creatures start attackign each other (would be pretty cool and fun though)

An easy example would be a room filled with headcrabs and barnacles, while in Half Life 1 it would be tricky to doge both headcrabs and barnacles, the barnacles would kill most of the Headcrabs in Half Life 2 for you.


So I would like to ask, how much thoughts and interpretations have you put into ecological system of Xen, especially the food chain?
Will you change certain situations to make the game more realistic from the additonal informations you could gather from Half Life 2 ?</description>

            <p>How may the headcrab behaviour from Half-Life 2 accommodate headcrab-predators that did not exist there? If it is used without adjustment, headcrabs would remain oblivious to bullsquids, which looks ridiculous. (Bullsquids are fairly <span class="bbcode-i">obvious</span> creatures.)</p>
<p>The facility would be much more lively with the simple goal of avoiding bullsquids, would it not? It wouldn’t give headcrabs any real chance for escape… but the simple fact the prey is moving will make sure that the scene flows much more naturally. Another few minutes of coding could make the doomed crab creatures jump fruitlessly every once in a while, heightening the illusion of a prey’s futile struggle.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t you agree this is worth taking an interest in adjusting?</p>

            <p>So it’s a wishy-washy mish-mash of things that would be better discussed elsewhere, or not at all since the headcrab behaviour from HL2 is going to be used.</p>

<p>The thread should be a discussion about creature behaviour in the mod: what we should expect, and why we should expect it. We discuss this to find out more about Black Mesa’s plans, and to point out how/why those plans may be improved.</p>
<p>It can’t be restricted to purely the Suggestion Box <span class="bbcode-i">or</span> the Got A Question thread, since any reply from a developer will affect the suggestion-like feedback.

            <p>I think headcrabs normally eat those little xen-spores that grow in certain places. The sizeable spores we saw were simply the ones that grew too big too quickly to be consumed by a headcrab. According to Kleiner, headcrabs can extract what they need from plant matter like watermelons.</p>
<p>As for taking control? Perhaps there <span class="bbcode-i">used</span> to be a more vulnerable species, perhaps one that enabled headcrabs to develop fully into gonarchs, but it got wiped out. (So after killing one of the last gonarchs, we hear “Done, what have you done…”)</p>
<p>The headcrabs had probably become too numerous, causing that host extinction, because there weren’t enough bullsquids (who graciously evolved headless) to keep the headcrab population in check. The bullsquids had been hunted down by intelligent species because they were also a threat, like bears were reduced because they can threaten people.</p>
<p>A[/size]S FOR THE original post, I would like to see headcrabs either try to <span class="bbcode-i">defend</span> themselves from the superior predator bullsquids, or try to <span class="bbcode-i">flee ineffectively</span> from them.

<p>This thread is about Xen creatures and their behavior. And I think that show did have a lot of similarities. I know perfectly well that it has nothing to do with either Black Mesa or Half-Life. If you can’t bring up stuff like that in this thread then why does this thread even exist? It’s about discussion around a subject and a bit of brain storming.</p>

            <p>I always wondered about the headcrab/vort thing - theres one major thing against the little buggers trying to couple with vortigaunts, and thats the likely scenario that each vort is a little like an electric eel, insomuch as it has a natural electric current circulating about its body, thus if a headcrab did try any funny business, BAM! Fried head-humper.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>There is an alternative to what headcrabs fed on while on Xen - have a wander about there and see if you can spot anything other than the Gonarch that looks vaguely headcrab-like.<br>
Considering HL is a science fiction story, I’d imagine theres a nice science fictiony explanation there somewhere (they do seem to be a fairly basic sort of organism, so they’d be latching onto pretty much anything organic that didn’t try and fight back - I would think that they probably gurgled “surprise” so as to distract humans when they wound up in Black Mesa, thus neatly getting around any resistance.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>

            <p>Well I knew the Combine didn’t bring them there. I was just answering his “even then, why?” question. I think that Headcrabs lived off of the healing springs. Latching onto things was a part-time job.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The Combine had nothing to do with the headcrabs on Xen.  They weaponize them on Earth, but that’s different.  They are opportunistic, so when they saw the headcrabs had infested Earth during the Portal Storms, they took advantage of the situation.  The headcrabs, I believe, were brought to Xen by the Nihilanth and Controllers for food, or perhaps to be used as a type of guard dog, in case the Vorts ever tried to escape and break free of their psychic prison.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the next point: the headcrabs probably fed on the Vorts, as they were the only humanoid creature in Xen <span class="bbcode-i">the could have fed on</span>.  I doubt very much the headcrabs attacked Gargs, Grunts, or especially the Controllers (they fucking FLY).</p>
<p>Anyway, since the topic has drifted away from BM, should this be moved to the HL section?</p>

<p>Ever watch some zombies movies? Mainly Resident Evil. The basis of it was that the military were attempting to create bio-warfare weapontry. And they succeeded except they unleashed it upon theirselves. If it were to be used on the enemy, they would simply take care of themselves. Same principle with using headcrabs to take out the opposing side (Rebels/citizens).</p>

<li>
<p>Because you’re acting like a child.  You posted a link to a site and pictures that NO ONE appreciated in your other thread, hoping to gain some newfound respect by linking your interest in HL to everyone else.  But I can vouch for the fact that everything we have to do is not connected to HL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You just posted a link.  Even if the creatures in that dreadful show HAD looked like Xen creatures (see 3), you didn’t bother to say why this similarity was important to the topic at hand.  In neither post did you say anything.  Just a link and pictures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately, none of the creatures look remotely like Xen creatures, and instead are the product of unoriginal minds with little creativity.  The only (far-fetched) exception is that plant shit.  And yet it’s still pretty different.  The only thing going for it is “hurr it has pointy things that stab stab wheres my glue hurr”.</p>

            <p>Why so crazy Winged One?</p>
<p>I posted the pics because they show similar creatures to those found on Xen. And one plant/tree is exactly (or VERY) like the one from Xen. Namely the butcher tree.</p>

<p>Is that true? I’m not a Half-Life historian or anything, but didn’t they get the samples for the experiment (in the beginning of the game, that Gordon is a part of) from Xen?</p>

What then did headcrabs eat before?</p>
<p>I see 2 options here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Headcrabs were put there externally by the combine and were not native. But, even then, why? How do they stay alive? What do they eat?</li>
<li>Headcrabs attach themselves to something other than humans in Xen. Bullsquids? no. Houndeyes? nah. The hornet dudes? Maybe. Vortigaunts? Booyah!<br>
I realize it wont happen though.</li>
