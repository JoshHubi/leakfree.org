    <title>Recommend me PS3 games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/recommend-me-ps3-games/4858</link>
    <description>I bought a PS3 along with the Uncharted games (brilliant games). Recomend me some games for it, but only PS3 or console exclusive games. Games that are also on PC don&#39;t count, unless they play a lot better on console.

            <p>Like I said, I will only play FPS games on the PS3 that are either PS3 exclusive or console exclusive. If it’s out for PC, I will get the PC version instead.</p>

            <p>The PS3 version doesn’t use AA, the graphics are noticably worse. Look up Gamespots’ comparison. I did play it on a HDTV, and I will have you know I am not biased, in fact I only got into PC gaming about a year ago, that is when I got my PC copy of Fallout 3 and enjoyed it quite a bit more than the PS3 version.</p>
<p>I doubt you will find anyone that agrees with you that PS3 is easier navigation, RTS games, tycoon games, all that are much easier to control on PC.</p>

<p>Thats my point you are stating as a fact that these games arent as good on the PS3, when you just cant say that, graphics vastly superior? There exactly the same they didnt change the graphics engine just to change platform. You played it on a HD TV right? It is also exactly the same for both platforms its not easier on the PC to use the menu if anything its easier as each button on the PS3 is assaigned to something while on the PC you have to click everything with the mouse which you have to travel for while the PS3 button does it in an instant? It can work either way  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . Beside thats such a minimal effect that most people wont care  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . I have completed both version too and i am sorry but the framerate is exactly the same and neither have had any bugs or crashes, actually my PC version crashed once…i am not a fan of any platform or console and play everything (literally everything) so you can always trust me as i can give suggestion which arent biast is any way and always give in my own ‘personal opinion’ (for future reference). I try to look at the positives of a game, if a game is fun, why not play it?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Thankyou for saying in your opinion. It makes me happy  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also as a note <a href="http://play.com" rel="nofollow noopener">play.com</a> is a good games site but i sometimes managed to find cheaper games on amazon. They normally managed to get a work around and theres one thats cheaper than the rest.</p>

            <p>No I am not referring to the keyboard and mouse thing, though I could easily do so, as it easier to go through the menus on the PC, not to mention controlling. Secondly the graphics are vastly superior. Then the mods of course, while a valid reason, are not the only reason. Then the framerate is much better on the PC. This is coming from someone who has completed both versions, with around one hundred hours on each. Mercenaries 2 is personal choice, but it is glitchy and unappealing in my opinion. Also, seeing as Maxey ruled out games that play worse on console…</p>

</aside>
<p>i am sorry but i think this post is to do with personal preference. If you listened to my post i said that Mercenaries 2 was only good with your friends in co-op. And i enjoyed, obviously not after youve completed it but theres hardly any games that are fun when your completed it. Secondly Infamous does get repetitive, after you’ve completed it…but it is a very good game i went through it all entertained all the way through i even went through it again to do the evil side. And as for fallout 3 and new vagas being better on PC…no…well yes, ‘personally’ the PC version recks it with all the addons you can get from unofficial creators but other than that all the official created content for fallout is avaliable on any platform. Also are you refering to the fact that its easier on keyboard and mouse? Because that argument is void because it doesnt matter who you are you can be just as good with a PS3 controller as you are with a mouse, it just takes practise, besides the whole point of that game is to use the VATS system, which either a PC or PS3 gamer would still use. It’s not that difficult anyway. Just thought i would say this so he doesnt cross them off the list because some people dont relise that there way isnt always the best for everyone else.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Agreed with a lot of the exclusives so far,<br>
If you’re looking for a combination shooter/stragety, Valkyria Chronicles is pretty fun, with a WW2 esque storyline<br>
Also, checkout Wipeout HD, and the Fury add-on, it’s also a great game</p>
<p>Also something useful, even though most PS3’s (virtually all) cannot play PS2 games anymore, try old PS1 games if you can find them, most will still work, I didn’t have to buy the Crash games on the PSN or the Spyro games, along with the numbered FF’s.  So try that out, because that’s a good way to play some good old games and save money as well.<br>
Finally, try Fat Princess</p>

            <p>Is really annoying trying to think what games i ahve for my ps3 and my minds gone blank…hate that. Erm ones which havnt been mentioned are Mercenaries 2 (only really good in online co-op) but you may like singleplayer. I ahd fun in co-op. Definately Infamous. Also Infamous 2 coming out. Oh actually rather than getting LBP1 i think you should get LBP 2 since its coming out very soon. Also Fallout 3 and the new fallout new vagas thats coming out soon. oo also Motorstorm, out of most racing games on ps3 its actually the only one i enjoyed. Braid is a good puzzle game. oo also Burnout Paradise. It kept me entertained for a while  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> . erm, ugh theres more but i dont ahve access to my games atm, stupid brain… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I’ve heard that Darksiders can be a great game if you’re willing to overlook how it’s just about completely derivative of every other good console game out there. The same thing is true for 3DDot Hero.</p>
<p>You should also make sure to keep your eyes peeled for any news of Ico/Shadows of the Colossus coming to the PS3 the way GoW1+2 did, and also look out for The Last Guardian by the same developers. Just about everything else I can think of has been suggested already, unless you’re willing to talk about downloadable stuff like Braid(available on PC, but unless you’ve got a USB controller to play it with, then you NEED to play it properly with a controller), Echochrome1&amp;2, FlOw (the PC version is free, but I’m fairly sure the PS3 version has more features or levels or something), and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver(PSOne) is worth picking up if you haven’t played it before.</p>

            <p>Oh wait. Sorry about that. I got mixed up, I got Prologue free with my Playstation and traded it in. At any rate, their will probably be a demo closer to the main game release.</p>

<p>Is there a GT5 Prologue demo? I’m not too much into racing games but I’d like to check it out.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its called Gran Turismo HD. That was the first demo I ever downloaded back when PSN was soo new back in late '06 I think. It might of been replaced by a newer demo in some shitty NASCAR course where your only car is a 370Z and zero driving aids. Just look it up in the PS3 games area, search by letter, then that should show up!<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Why was Demon’s Souls only suggested twice? It’s easily the best PS3 exclusive (if you’re into that sort of game, of course.)</p>
<p>Anyway, Demon’s Souls, Heavy Rain, The R&amp;C games, Resistance 1&amp;2, MGS4(If you’ve played the first three, otherwise this will be a clusterfuck of WHAT JUST HAPPENED and WHO IS THIS).</p>
