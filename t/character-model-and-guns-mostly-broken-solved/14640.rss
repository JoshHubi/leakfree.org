    <title>Character Model and guns Mostly Broken- Solved</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/character-model-and-guns-mostly-broken-solved/14640</link>
    <description>Hi I was combating the AI disabled issue which seemed to happen after i swapped computers over the steam cloud. Anyway I asked a friend and he said to try cl_showfps 1  and promptly that broke everything.  As you can see from the attached screenshots everything is just broken and weird. It is slightly more playable than when the AI was brain dead but it is equally unsatisfying. I have no idea how to fix this I have wasted the last two hours troubleshooting from deleting and reinstalling restarting the game changing computers and nothing. Even if I start a new game it doesn&#39;t go away, I am not even completely sure if this is an actual error or just some weird source thing. I just made it to blast pits ending and I really do not want to restart but I will if necessary. I really just want to know how to fix this as this is driving me crazy. I could not figure out how to wipe my cloud data so I decided coming here might be a better place to check first anyway. Thank you for any help you can provide.

            <p>Well that did work I have to restart the game but that’s fine its a great game and I knew that while going in, I do have a save in my Dropbox from right before this all started while it was still working on my laptop and I was attempting to figure out that AI disabled thing,  I am kind of wary to try that though. Do I need to close this out or something or will the mods just take care of it, this is my first time actually resorting to forums myself to solve something I couldn’t find.</p>

            <p>It wasn’t exactly random it was just to try and identify surroundings details, but I have tried restarting at least 10 times and it is across  both of my computers new game or no. I haven’t even looked at mods for this yet as it was my first play through and everything was going great until that happened I honestly never even thought of that as this essentially became a paid mod so good to be its own thing, like the Stanley parable. I have verified my game cache 5+ times on both computers and I just deleted everything associated with the game turned off the cloud and am currently attempting a reinstall. Thanks for attempting to help, I guess I may of come across as inexperienced with steam problems with my gross lack of understanding of console commands but  Everything you listed above has already been attempted numerous times, that is why I came to the internet for help, because four hours of trying to figure this out alone seemed like it was already too long, especially since this game is practically in early access still. If this reinstall doesn’t work though I will let you know.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">Your AI disabled glitch was caused by broken saves that can happen after game patches and updates.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Before you start typing random things into the console it’s a good idea to understand what they are. cl_showfps 1 just displays the frames per second, it would not have fixed your problem but should not have made anything worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Here is a good starting point of things to try.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1. Restart your computer. Both Windows 8 and 10 have a hybrid hibernation file that will corrupt over time and the only way to clear it is by restarting. Shutting down the pc and turning it back on does not clear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2. A lot of mods are broken with the latest update. Properly unsubscribe, uninstall and remove any mods you have installed.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Additionally, if you are experiencing issues with missing models or textures in-game, you have a legacy error with mods. If you have subscribed to any mods since launch and are experiencing these issues please do the following steps to fix the issue.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bbcode-b">1. Unsubscribe from all Black Mesa mods<br>
</span></li>
<li><span class="bbcode-b">2. Go to ***\SteamApps\workshop\content\362890 (where *** is the location to where your steam games may be)<br>
</span></li>
<li><span class="bbcode-b">3. Delete all folders within this folder<br>
</span></li>
<li>
<span class="bbcode-b">4. Launch Black Mesa, and you should be good to go.<br>
</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Once you do this, you should be able to re-subscribe to any and all mods that you want.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">3. Verify your Game Cache. here is a link explaining how.<a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4. A saved game could be corrupt. Go to New Game and restart an unlocked chapter. Updates may corrupt and break save files. If you’re experience any issues with old loads, please restart the game at the start of that chapter. You can do that by clicking “New Game” on the main menu, and picking the latest chapter you were on. </span></p>

            <p>Yes I have, I have cleared as much As I could to the point of deleting the game and reinstalling with it of deleting the folder itself might work though So I will try that.</p>

            <p>Yes, but as far as I can tell the damage has been done, and I cannot figure out how to clear out the cloud. I found the steam file folder and followed an online guide but it did not revert to a fresh download.</p>

            <p>Hmm, well thanks for responding but that was definitely not it I even tried a new game with it to no avail although I did notice the shadows are definitely a problem too, seeing as how no matter the weapon it continued showing the stun crossbow shadow, so it probably goes deeper.<br>

            <p>Okay based on lack of response I decided that the screenshots I posted might not look that bad so I went back in and figured out a way to show just how bad the issue is. Please help I really hope it is something simple and I am just being stupid or something because trying to play like this just isn’t fun. This is what happens when I die by bullets. Please help.<br>

Even if I start a new game it doesn’t go away, I am not even completely sure if this is an actual error or just some weird source thing. I just made it to blast pits ending and I really do not want to restart but I will if necessary. I really just want to know how to fix this as this is driving me crazy. I could not figure out how to wipe my cloud data so I decided coming here might be a better place to check first anyway. Thank you for any help you can provide.<br>
