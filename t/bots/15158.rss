    <title>Bots?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bots/15158</link>
    <description>So I decided to play some multiplayer. To my suprise, there was one server with bots included. When I joined, it was filled with bots, but there were almost no functioning. They kinda were, but they were just walking slowly, with almost no shooting. I got kicked from that server, sadly  :frowning:  (propably because I called them &quot;stupid fuckers&quot;, I apologise for that).

I didn&#39;t even know this game supports bots.

What was that supposed to be?</description>

            <p>Yeah, the bots are just stock Source bots, whose functionality we implemented to allow us to test network stuff locally. They were never intended to actually be used for anything else. As the users speculated above, they’re probably being used to artificially inflate player counts to attract players.</p>

<p>All source games support bots, however their basic AI is just to stand still or mimic a player’s movement.<br>
So they were probably only in the server to seed the server, so people would join it instead of a different server.</p>

<p>^ This.</p>
<p>Plus, if memory doesn’t fail me, Chon said that the bots were added for some tests they did, or something similar.</p>
