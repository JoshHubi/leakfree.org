    <title>Flashlight crashes game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/flashlight-crashes-game/14844</link>
    <description>I reinstalled Black Mesa after a long while of having it (uninstalled it before to free up a bit of disk space) and when I tried using my flashlight in-game for the first time, as it was[/size] [b]very [/size][/b]dark in the area I was in, and it crashed my game. I relaunched the game and tried again; same conclusion. I even tried changing the flashlight button from its default &quot;F&quot; to something random like &quot;X&quot;, and that made no difference. Is anyone else having this same issue? Any ideas on how to fix it? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.[/size]</description>
