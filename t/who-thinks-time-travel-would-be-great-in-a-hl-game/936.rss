            <p>well idk…we have our cloning technology these days so I’m sure the Combine would either already have it or adopt it and perfect it and left 1 specimen of our kind,either dead or alive and use the DNA to clone humans.but i’m sure the combine doesn’t want us anymore as weapons as one single human who had performed one basic course of weaponry,combat and such defeated,killed,destroyed most of the transhuman-army BY HIMSELF.but if Breen didn’t surrender us we would still have resisted and the combine would have been forced to kill us.<br>
but back to topic:I still don’t think timetravel is a good feature in half life</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technically speaking, everyone is time-traveling into the future at same basic speed.  It takes approximately 86,400 seconds to time-travel to one day in the future.   Other forms of time travel, however, such as those seen in stories (instananeously such as “Back to the Future” or gradual such as “Time Machine”), however, require other methods.  In fact, all you need to do is to move very fast and you can time-travel into the future at a greater speed than your (virtually) stationary counterparts (if you can get moving so fast that you’re approaching the speed of light, if you return, you can find that, while not much time has passed for you, a great amount of time has passed for your point of origin – “Flight of the Navigator”).</p>
<p>Backwards time travel (into the past), though, has its problems.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Indeed.<br>
For backwards time travel, we’d have to be travelling faster than the speed of light, which, as far as we know, is impossible.</p>
<p>I personally wouldn’t like time travel in a HL game as it’s just not… right.</p>

<p>Austin: Wait a tick. Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, presumably, I could go back and visit my frozen self. But, if I’m still frozen in 1967, how could I have been un-thawed in the '90s and traveled back to…Oh, no, I’ve gone cross-eyed.<br>
Basil: I suggest you don’t worry about those things and just enjoy yourself…That goes for you all, too.<br>
Austin: Yes.</p>

            <p>Ding! Achievement Unlocked - “Wanna be like Youtube”</p>
<p>You have all successfully recreated the unparalleled stupidity of a youtube comment system.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes, a FPS game where you go back in time and have to fight dinosaurs, aliens and various cybernetic monstrosities like a robotic T-rex with laser beams would be incredibly awesome. That game exists already. Turok says; “Hi.” Gordon Freeman says; “Leave me the hell alone so I can goddamn finish HL2:e3.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only have they pretty well shown that T-rex isn’t likely to scavenge any more than a lion or any other predatory hunter animal, but that recent fossil evidence points towards the T-rex actually being a pack hunter. The type of science pointing towards T-rex being a scavenger is much the same type of science that reasoned that because the Apatosaurus was so large, it wouldn’t be able to support its own weight outside of water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The equations upon which the time dilation effect are calculated use the SPEED(not velocity) of light SQUARED.<br>
As you approach the speed of light, the time dilation effect would occur in such a way that you would experience less time that those people who traveled at a standard rate. In essence, for every 1 year you experienced, everyone else might experience 10. Theoretically, you have traveled forward in time, but one would be hard pressed to find any difference between this and just being put in suspended animation for 9 years.<br>
Now, the reasons that you can’t travel BACKWARDS through time are shown by the two words that I put in all caps; SPEED and SQUARED. First of all, in order to travel FORWARDS in time, you have to travel at a faster speed, such that you approach that of light. Setting aside for a moment that you actually could get the energy needed to accomplish that, while still surviving the forces of acceleration involved, that also would mean that in order to travel BACKWARDS through time, you would need to travel at a NEGATIVE SPEED. Stand perfectly still, your speed is zero, move in any direction, your speed is now greater than zero. TRAVELING BACKWARDS IS NOT A NEGATIVE SPEED. THERE IS NO SPEED LESS THAN ZERO.<br>
On top of that, when you actually move the equation around in order to do a calculate time dilation, you wind up with the majority of the equation under a huge SQUARE ROOT function. Even if you did, by some inane destruction of the laws of physics, manage to travel in a negative speed, you would still end up with the equation taking the Square root of a negative number. A negative number multiplied by a negative number is still POSITIVE, so there is no such thing as a square root that results in a real negative number. You instead end up with results that math terms “imaginary numbers” so for an incredibly poetic twist, traveling backwards in time is only possible in our IMAGINATION.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ahhh… it feels so much better to get that out of my system. Now if you all will excuse me, I need to go clean the stupid off of my boots.</p>
