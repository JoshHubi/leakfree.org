    <description>So I&#39;m making a CS:GO map and I&#39;ve completed everything, including the namesh, but the stupid bots always get stuck on prop_door_rotating entities. I&#39;ve looked at valve&#39;s .bsps and navmeshs without noticing any particular difference that would cause my bots to get stuck when there&#39;s don&#39;t. The primary way they get stuck is they open the door and then try to close it before walking through causing them to get stuck. The other way it happens is they open the door fully, and for inexplicable reasons decide to endlessly unload bullets into the door. In the second case this will often happen with all 5 bots at once sitting there shooting over and over at a fully open door.

^Note, bots will get stuck on both the inside and the outside of the door in this manner
