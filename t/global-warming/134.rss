    <description>I haven&#39;t really researched much into it. But is it true that natural disasters seem to be at an upward trend?

Also, polar bears is one of the world&#39;s oldest animals. But this time, they could really become extinct! ( [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTeQSZC9CP8[/url] )

What is your views on Global Warming?</description>

<p>“That’s about it”? Why do you think it’s called global (!) warming? It affects the entire globe, not just a few regions. It doesn’t just affect the sea level, it’ll cause floods, droughts, losses in crop, changes to the seasons, makes animal migration harder etc. The polar areas and sea level rise are just in the spotlight.<br>
This is a huge issue that needs to be dealt with. Just like any other to-be disaster. Like the before mentioned rainforests.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m quite confused here.</p>
<p>It seems like a lot of ignorant people are yelling that everyone else is ignorant for no other reason than the climate changes once in a while.</p>
<p>And also people are saying that forests do more harm than good, and that algae are the things that give us all oxygen. Now - please correct me if I’m wrong, and I’ll stand down - both algae and trees take up oxygen. They also give out oxygen that they haven’t used.</p>
<p>So that’s that out of the way.</p>
<p>Humanity has is undoubtedly partly responsible for climate change: the amount of carbon we produce isn’t as much as volcanoes etc, but we produce it continually. It does add up, and it does have an effect, namely raising the temperature of the planet: it’s rudimentary science, and I’ll explain if asked.</p>
<p>The temperature raise has an effect all over, as it effects whether systems and the general climate.</p>
<p>You can’t leave it to the grandchildren, because we are already feeling some effects now. For example, when I’m 80 (2070-ish), it’s fairly likely that the transatlantic current will stop flowing causing Britain to have similar weather to Russia.</p>
<p>EDIT: Alcator, I hope you were joking when you posted, because that was just sickening.</p>

<p>Yes. You clearly need to do some more research on that.</p>
<p>Algae is the word you’re looking for here.</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that young, growing forest uses up heaps more oxygen than the rainforest as it now stands.</p>

<p>How would you like it if people started saying that if a comet crashed on wherever you live?</p>
<p>If I’m not mistaken, <span class="bbcode-i">algae</span> produce the most net oxygen. The rainforest sucks most of what it puts out up again at night. Which isn’t to say we’re still losing a very valuable part of the planet of course.</p>

</aside>
<p>Very very true, it really doesn’t. Nature and ecosystems don’t need our help in fixing themselves.  However, I’m more concerned with how we’re going to fair.  I really wish all those people proclaiming about how bad our animals or oceans and what have you are going to suffer and just be honest that all we’re really worried about, and should be, is <span class="bbcode-i">US</span> and how we’re going to be effected by the changes.</p>
<p>If we aren’t a part of nature as they say, we need to provide protect for our own (read: our species) rather than worrying about animals that aren’t particularly greatly important to our ecosystem services (read: species and ecosystems that are not of great importance to our survival).</p>
<p>Of course, how to determine what is or is not important to us is the difficulty…</p>

<p>It’s the same as saying ‘I have cancer at 24, but most people end up with cancer when they are in their 90s so its perfectly natural.’</p>
<p>Except instead of “24” its “200 years after the Industrial Revolution” and instead of “in their 90s” its “every* few million years.”</p>
