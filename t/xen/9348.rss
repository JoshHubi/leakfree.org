    <description>Xen is going to be separate so what do the people think it will have? 


I know from the wiki that Xen was going to be the second half of the campaign for hl1, but for some unknown reason it was spliced to a small section of what it was going to be. The main thing that was removed was a uprising of the vorts lead by the player, remnants of this planned feature can be found in locations on xen in one area there are 2 guards watching a group of vorts working, the vorts in this location are none hostile to the player. (this information comes from the wiki)

what do you guys think might appear in xen sense it isn&#39;t coming with the main mod?</description>

            <p>Wait, is Ram serious about cutting down the Xen section of Anomalous Materials?  This seems to further the idea that the BM team was pressured to release something quickly.</p>
<p>…what if this whole Xen split is just Ram trying to save fifty dollars?  :0</p>

<p>I’m really unsure as to what to expect from Xen.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes. I did not care for Xen at all and I will admit to being one of the bums who just noclipped some parts completely. It was just too frustrating at times. I really had a desire to just skip it all.</p>
<p>So I agree. Devs, take your sweet time and make this the best it can be. “If you give a mouse a cookie” kind of applies here (give us BM:Earthbound and we’ll want the rest soon enough). But seriously, I’ve been waiting on this thing for a while and I’ll be just happy with 3/4’s of the game versus 0/4’s.</p>

<p>That being said, I’m glad that the BM development team has delayed its release (as I do not care much about it) and rather utilized further time in order to produce the best possible result and I hope it will be somewhat the opposite of what HL1 had to offer.<br>
I do realize that I’m likely to be the only one with this opinion, but what I’ve always liked was the HL2 episode 2 design of the antlion caves.<br>
These were also a bit surreal and immersive, yet they provided enough consistency to keep you moving.<br>
In fact, it’s exactly the kind of thing I’d go for in a source remake of HL1, simply for the fact that this is exactly what valve showed us as an example of what the aliens can come up with if left on their own.</p>

<p>It would be fun not having xen ending abruptly after killing nihilanth. But instead seeing Gordon not being attacked by vorts anymore. Rather them turning back to their role as "game keepers"in the borderworld. Then seeing HECU storm the place and help fighting them off until vorts/aliens have to retreat temporarily. Then snip enter gman - end blabla. Next wake up on train to city 17.<br>
There shouldn’t be any references to the combine, as they only flood the borderworld a little after the nihilanth is killed…</p>

<p>Though highly improbable, this would be actually very cool. It would also be cool if black Mesas xen would be aligned to valve’s new concept.</p>

<p>I’m just happy we will have seen a glimpse of their “drastically different direction” for Xen by this Friday. We travel very briefly to Xen during the Resonance Cascade, after all. I hope it is an interesting vista.</p>
<p>However, they might’ve not wanted to spoil their interpretation of Xen so soon. Since the “Xen” part of the mod is months away (or maybe a few years away, god forbid), whatever we get in the first release might be an even more limited view of Xen than the little there was in the original Half-Life.</p>
<p>Dunno, both scenarios make sense: the mod is bigger and more epic, so they might’ve gone that route with the initial glimpse or Xen; an sprawling vista with strange buildings and creatures far away, similar to the Xen scenes you get with G-Man in the ending scene, after being teleported away from Nihilanth’s chamber.</p>
<p>Or… they might’ve made it even more of a tease, with just a teensy little glimpse of what’s to come.</p>

<p>Oh  fuck, the Antlions.<br>
That thought has never crossed My Mind.</p>

It would actually be pretty cool if, when you arrive on the alien planet, you could see a few HECU, maybe even an apache, fighting their way desperately inside Xen, and then getting killed by the alien. This would be a nice way to say that it’s over for them, you’re not gonna have to fight them anymore, their story is closed.</p>
<p>And for the skybox design, you’re right, I love this one<br>
