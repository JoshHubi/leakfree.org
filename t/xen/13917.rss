    <title>Xen?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xen/13917</link>
    <description>I was wondering if Xen will be released for the free version. The dev team said that they will not stop supporting the free version of the game, and I was wondering if that meant that they will release Xen for free as well. I am sorry if this question is repetitive, but I cant find anything to help me. Thank you for your time.</description>

            <p>The free version is going to remain as-is (except for some bug fixes).  You will need the retail version for Xen (when itâ€™s done), multiplayer, and so forth.</p>
