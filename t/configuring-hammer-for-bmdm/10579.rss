    <title>Configuring Hammer for BMDM</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/configuring-hammer-for-bmdm/10579</link>
    <description>I have made many many maps for mods, and this part is always the hardest lol. That is besides leaks and well hammer frustrations in general. Is there anybody that knows how to configure hammer for BMDM ? For some reason I think that it should run under sdk 2007 yet I find it impossible to get anything to load under 2007 and have had this problem before with another mod. Currently I am loading it under sdk 2009. In other words 2007 will not let me set anything up because it does not see any games that use it.

ahh i hope this helps lol basically the same thing here just change for black mesa as needed ... and btw i am the creator of Emp_slaughtered for this mod  :stuck_out_tongue:  [url]https://wiki.empiresmod.com/index.php?title=Configuring_Hammer_for_Empires[/url]

quick blurb to also help more.... easy fix try copping the gameconfig.txt file from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\[your name]\sourcesdk\bin\source2009\bin
to
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\[your name]\sourcesdk\bin\source2007\bin
that let me access source sdk to set it up for black mesa [ also the (x86) is for 64bit os you might not have that</description>
