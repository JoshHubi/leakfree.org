    <description>Now, I know that I&#39;m probably missing something here, but has there ever been a official reason for the NDA with Valve? It just gets more frustrating by the day when all kinds information has to be held back from BM for no other reason than what in all honesty looks like a pointless phantom contract... again, I know that there is probably something on the legal side of things that I am missing, but still...  :frowning:</description>

            <p>Asking why they’re under a NDA defeats the purpose of the NDA as it would disclose something they’re not supposed to disclose. I don’t see why this is such a difficult concept for you to grasp.</p>
<p>Seriously, there’s <span class="bbcode-i">obviously </span>a reason they’re under NDA, Valve didn’t become worth 3 billion by making retarded legal decisions. And chances are they can’t tell you because that’s kinda what a NDA does, so quit asking. It’s standard for any project that’s been Greenlit, be it mod or indie game.</p>
<p>You’re acting as if the devs aren’t allowed to tell you anything because of it, but you’re wrong, this is how the devs have been for years. Not telling you stuff is of their own accord. They just aren’t the talkative bunch. I think a dev has stated that the NDA only applies to release related info.</p>

<p>Er… how? How is asking why the BM devs cant talk about some of their own game’s development not because they don’t want to, but because they are forced to keep silent for… whatever reason counter intuitive? Whats worth Valve not wanting disclosed in BM? It just seems to have no benefit whatsoever,  and considering that BM is a free fanmade product (and a awesome one that I and many others support at that) it makes even less sense why just putting the game on Steam would cause this… still, I’m probably a dum dummy who doesn’t know anything about this <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
