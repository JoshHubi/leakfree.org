    <title>Gravity - QPhysics - VPhysics - oh my</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gravity-qphysics-vphysics-oh-my/2920</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had an idea for a game in my head for years... A large part of this game requires localized gravity for each player and or vehicle.

[url=&#39;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Gravity&#39;]From what i can tell[/url] Vphysics is for the entire scene while Qphysics is reserved for players/NPC.
Also stated in the wiki is that [url=&#39;https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/QPhysics#QPhysics&#39;]&quot;Vehicles and flying NPCs do use VPhysics...&quot;[/url]

So does this mean that all Vehicles and flying NPCs must use the same gravity? Or am I reading that wrong.</description>

            <p>I have no idea. From what I know of Source and the SDK Vphysics controls everything and yes they do share gravity but the weight of the props/npcs changes it. You may be able to use a brush entity I’ve forgotten the name of (trigger_gravity/func_gravity) I’ve never played around with them BUT you might be able to edit the flags to change what it affects so the player/props have lower gravity whereas it would use a different entity for other things.</p>
