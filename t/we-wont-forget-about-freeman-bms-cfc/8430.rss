It&#39;s time to show your love for Half-Life and Black Mesa Source! Less than one hour left before the &quot;we won&#39;t forget about Freeman&quot; event, join the group in the link below and when 11:00 PM GMT (in 41 minutes) dongs, restart your good old HL, and give this group some level so that we can (maybe) have better communication between us and the dev&#39;s of this mod!

I&#39;ll post another final statement for the CFC in 24 hours, with I hope, a screenshot of how long people played together HL during this evening/night, go on fans!</description>

            <p>I shouldn’t have called it “call for communication”, but “do you need a hand to better communicate with your fans and news websites?” <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

            <p>OKAY, OKAY, it’s over, the BMS CFC is considered dead, so you can “un-ghost” my posts and delete this topic if you want,</p>
<p>I won’t “troll” or what ever you call that, any more… Many signs are indicating a soon to be release, so I guess I can wait patiently…</p>
<p>But, still : 254 members <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

            <p>WTF? Why my topic is unreadable? I’ve checked the site “unlogged”, and I don’t see it…</p>
<p>Is it some obscure thing to shut my mouth?? Don’t play that “game” with me, it’s really unnerving.</p>

            <p>Massive failure -_-</p>
<p>However, we’re on 160!!</p>
<p>Here is the message :</p>
<p>The lack of communication between Black Mesa Source team and the moddb community has been a frustrating experience, ever since the failure of the 2009 deadline, and their subsequent isolation from moddb, but also with their very sporadic news on their wikia, or on their official forums.<br>
Fans of the Half-Life series have waited years for a word on when the mod will be finally released, while it is known that there are more near the end of development, we don’t have any substantial new images, new files, or real new videos… (I don’t count that recent Abrahms + gibs explosion on a test map).</p>
<p>So, Instead of focusing efforts in a negative and disrespectful way, we have decided to gain BMS team’s attention by delivering a basic message:</p>
<p>Your giant running fanbase, who EACH YEAR vote you in top upcoming mods on moddb, even WITHOUT ANY NEWS, would like better communication.</p>
<p>Waiting patiently for over six years is a painfully task, especially when other teams, focused on other sequels and remakes, I will name them all : Opposing Force 2, Operation Black Mesa, Guard Duty, Decay Source. They all give us information. They all face sometimes trolls or raging guys saying they are lazy, bad, too slow, criticizing every new media released… BUT their teams faced it, they faced the part of “fanbase” which is composed of stupid trolls, because they know the greatest part of their fans are mainly silent but still following and enjoying silently every media release… And they’re happy with it</p>
