    <title>Aquaria</title>

    <description>You heard me obsess about it in group chat, and now...[/SIZE]
With my main computer dead for now, I&#39;ve been obsessively playing this indie title for a looong time now.
[url=&#39;https://store.steampowered.com/app/24420/&#39;]Aquaria[/SIZE]
[img]https://www.product-reviews.net/wp-content/userimages/2007/06/aquaria-editor-game-editing-tools-for-mac-being-released.jpg[/img][/url]
from the Store page:
Aquaria is an award-winning action-adventure game set in a massive underwater world teeming with life and filled with ancient secrets. Join Naija, a lone underwater adventurer, as she travels from hidden caves shrouded in darkness, to beautiful, sunlit oases in search of her past. She&#39;ll uncover hidden treasures, explore uncharted waters, and do battle with massive underwater beasts to learn the truth about her family and reveal the secret of Aquaria.

Normally when I think &#39;indie&#39;, I expect something fairly short but with a unique artstyle that makes me glad I supported them.
Aquaria, on the other hand, felt like it cut no corners whatsoever. Most players report a total playtime of around 20 hours, and new experiences all along the way. It&#39;s an expansive adventure game like Metroid or Castlevania, through and through, encompassing many different environments: The dark and forbidding depths of the sea, the sunny Veil (surface of the water), ruins of ancient civilizations, etc. It even has numerous side-quests and extra powerups/collectables you can get all over the place. Finally, it&#39;s one of the last remaining games I can think of that actually has a whole succession of challenging, thrill-inducing boss fights. (consulting a random FAQ, it totals 19 bosses; many of which are actually optional)
If you&#39;re not sure, at least give it a try from the [url=https://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/demo.html]demo[/url]

And finally, if you got the Humble Indie Bundle but never bothered downloading this one....then for GOD&#39;S SAKE, man, don&#39;t let it go to waste!

PS. To anyone who just looks at the metacritic reviews, here is a quote from the guy who did the one 70 that offset the score.
[quote=eurogamer reviewer]
I tried to sound upbeat and happy with it, because I certainly was, so score-bickerers should focus on the words. Also the comment on the price is clearly open to interpretation - people who disagree would probably think and score higher. And you&#39;re right - such a very pretty and atmospheric game, and so warming after about 48 billion men-with-guns games. I&#39;m sitting here playing UT3 on PS3 at the moment and I would certainly rather be playing Aquaria! Why aren&#39;t more games about magical underwater fairy things?

            <p>Was really enjoying it until I had to start doing moves with mouse gestures. NO! WHY!? Mouse gestures are horrible and I can’t do them at all so the game is unplayable for me. Please tell me I’m being dumb and I can bind keys to them.</p>
<p>Also, no one mentioned Maxey’s awesome Big Lebowski reference that won the argument instantly.</p>

            <p>I love Aquaria. The whole plot is amazing, and the ambient music is… soothing…</p>
<p>I feel I must contribute to this thread so: Black Bob, all your points are invalid, get off the internet.</p>

            <p>A few tips for anyone playing it:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are keyboard shortcuts for all Naija’s forms; from the 1 key, going upwards as you discover them. (1, 2, 3)</li>
<li>Two parts of the game require you to “spin” (a puzzle involving gears, and the very last form you get) I don’t think they adequately covered how to do this ingame, so; Basically, hold the mouse down and move it quickly in a circle around Naija.</li>

<p>Clearly, the latter is better because it’s newer and more modern.</p>

            <p>Well, I do like similar adventure games, and the artwork seems beautiful, but I have a thing against underwater themed stuff. :fffuuu:</p>
<p>If it were something like Heart of Darkness, or even newer ones like Braid, I’d probably try it… Though I have the demo sitting in my download folder anyways.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know why I’m acknowledging the argument, but…sigh. I want you to at least understand why everyone thinks you’re being a twat. So here goes.</p>
<p>OBJECTION!<br>
Your entire argument rests on the faulty assumption that 2D is ‘better’ than 3D. It retains a number of artstyles that cannot exist in 3D. Anything done as an airbrush, painted, or otherwise done by hand can’t be translated into 3D without a lot of handwork and multiple team members (who may not all have the same idea of what it should look like). Even then, you cannot be sure that it will look as good as the 2D product.<br>
Also, you get more attention to specifically what’s needed for an individual image.<br>

I like the second one better.<br>
Furthermore, I don’t know if you noticed but not every man, woman, and child on Earth owns a GeForce 7 million. 3D is often unnecessarily taxing on system resources, putting in such dumb limits as “only X enemies onscreen before there’s a slowdown”.<br>
Additionally, it increases development time for a result that is not NECESSARILY better. This first part is obvious; I can draw a person in <a href="http://Paint.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">Paint.NET</a> in about one minute, whereas making a 3D textured person model would take up several hours of my time (partially because I am not good at modelling, but even a good modeller would take 15 minutes getting it set up) And again, the result is not necessarily improved because after all that effort it just means it can be viewed from multiple angles. The “wow” of “it’s in 3D!” wore off sometime in 2000.<br>
Finally, the gameplay mechanics can sometimes only work well in 2D. They tried making a 3D Metal Slug; something obviously within their capabilities since they did; and it utterly failed. The 3rd dimension ruined the ability to dodge bullets with as much precision, and made battlefields infinitely more complex. All Metal Slug games afterwards remain 2D bullet-twitch shooters, and are assuredly more difficult than Contra.</p>
<p>There. I’m done. If you don’t like a 2D game, get out of the 2D game thread.</p>

            <p>I don’t know why I’m acknowledging the argument, but…sigh. I want you to at least understand why everyone thinks you’re being a twat. So here goes.</p>
<p>OBJECTION!<br>
Your entire argument rests on the faulty assumption that 2D is ‘better’ than 3D. It retains a number of artstyles that cannot exist in 3D. Anything done as an airbrush, painted, or otherwise done by hand can’t be translated into 3D without a lot of handwork and multiple team members (who may not all have the same idea of what it should look like). Even then, you cannot be sure that it will look as good as the 2D product.<br>
Also, you get more attention to specifically what’s needed for an individual image.<br>

I like the second one better.<br>

            <p>Well black bob I’m here to throw a spanner in to your clockwork brain with one word, Sonic.</p>
<p>Sonic the hedgehog was one of the best 2D games of all time, so good in fact that you can still find people playing his original games on IPHONE’s.<br>
BUT Every time they have tried to bring him in to 3D it has failed miserably, so much so the next game there making is going back to 2D.</p>
<p>Aquaria IS using high tech and powerful graphics because it uses sprites, animation techniques and realistic phisics that would of been Far to complex for a game that came out during the time that 2d was the only thing around.</p>
<p>Using your train of thinking motion controllers are the currently the biggest new thing so all other control methods should be never used again, go on then what are you waiting for? Throw out your mouse and keyboard and start using just a wiimote though bluetooth to control your computer, its the latest technology so it MUST be superior to EVERYTHING that came before it.</p>

 Black Bob:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t mean to say that a 2D game can’t be fun. What i’m trying to say is that 2D games are of a time that has passed and should not be created anymore. A developer who creates 2D games is just taking it easy and spending less effort and money on old technology to make a game which he then tries to sell.</p>
<p>Imagine the following scenario: Let’s say that 10 years ago Ice cream caused cancer. However, with the advancing tecnology people found ways to create ice cream that <span class="bbcode-i">doesn’t</span> cause cancer. Skip ten years ahead and everyone is eating the ice cream that doesn’t cause cancer. Suddenly, some jerk decides to create the old ice cream that was cancerous. That’d be stupid, right? You wouldn’t buy it, right?</p>
<p>This also counts for 2D. Sure, 2D games don’t cause cancer, but you’re still buying something that’s old instead of something that’s better. Let’s look at Street Fighter 4 again. The first street fighter was in 2d, and so is the 4th. There have been no advancements in that; the developers have been lazy and did not feel like improving their game because enough people bought it already. However, the fact that they’re still trying to push 2d in a time where it simply <span class="bbcode-i">doesn’t belong</span> is stupid and results in a very low quality game. This has been proven for street fighter 4 (It shrivels away in comparison to games like Tekken 6 and Soul Calibur 4) and will also be the same for this Aquaria game.</p>
<p>I’m just stating simple facts…</p>

<p>And this:<br>

is in black and white, therefore it must be inferior to this:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
which is in color.</p>
<p>And look at this:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
Those hacks! Color movies were standard when this was made, how could they be so cheap?</p>
<p>And just look at how this old 2d animation…<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/9/944e41cf78c198569cdb721ce0713eab0e9b2217.jpeg" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/944e41cf78c198569cdb721ce0713eab0e9b2217" title=""><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/944e41cf78c198569cdb721ce0713eab0e9b2217_2_690x377.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="l9YkuWnSgMT0gfMfvpmG4tSciyP" width="690" height="377" srcset="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/944e41cf78c198569cdb721ce0713eab0e9b2217_2_690x377.jpeg, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/944e41cf78c198569cdb721ce0713eab0e9b2217_2_1035x565.jpeg 1.5x, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/9/944e41cf78c198569cdb721ce0713eab0e9b2217.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/944e41cf78c198569cdb721ce0713eab0e9b2217_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1280×700 438 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>Clearly gets blown out of the water by the incredible visuals of this masterpiece:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>and just look how this horribly outdated 2d game:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
was instantly made better when Sega chose to upgrade it to 3d:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/8/811ad77adb585849224dc2baa18bdbcfc7018b56.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="iq76jkPxeABPlfEB0e9FMCICkMm" width="626" height="399"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b9491c6ba162562498646a2fd5b366574adf3f5d.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="qr6Yf52a3iZ9hd52YMDAlzCWO0B" width="448" height="297"></p>
<p>It’s an ART STYLE, you tard. As long as it supports the gameplay and mood of the story, then it doesn’t matter WHICH artstyle is used. 3d animation DOESN’T make everything better, therefor making the claim that using a 2d artstyle is cheap, lazy, or not as effective, even in the most broadest generalization possible, is utterly stupid.</p>
