    <title>Helicopter encounter broken?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/helicopter-encounter-broken/11507</link>
    <description>When I first got the Rocket Launcher, I had a hell of a time shooting down the helicopter that appears right afterwards. Several times I shot all of my rockets (about 8 or so) at it, AND used the Tau laser, and it refused to die.

On the final try, I ended up hiding in the rocket launcher room, and when I poked my head back outside, the helicopter was facing to the side, shooting off into the distance. I proceeded to unload everything I had (rockets and lasers), only to cause the copter to start smoking and spinning in place. I wandered around for a while after that, and eventually found one last rocket I had missed, and FINALLY this one initiated the scripted crash.

Sorry I don&#39;t have screenshots, but I didn&#39;t think of taking any at the time, and have no idea what caused it to turn sideways, as it only did that once.</description>

            <p>Even replenishing with rockets, I must have unloaded fifteen plus my tau ammunition at it before dying and it only got to flaming smoke. Didn’t crash.</p>

            <p>Are you playing on hard difficulty? I played on normal and it took about 8 hits with rockets to take it down. When I finally did it (after like 5 tries), I noticed that there is a box nearby (where you got the launcher) with infinite rocket launcher ammo. You can use it with the E key, just like in Half-Life 2.</p>
<p>I also noticed that when NPC’s do some of their scripted sequences, it is impossible to do damage to them, but I doubt that this applies to the helicopter at that point.</p>
