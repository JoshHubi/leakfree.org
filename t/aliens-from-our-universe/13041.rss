    <title>Aliens From Our Universe</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/aliens-from-our-universe/13041</link>
    <description>I know Half Life consists of extradimensional beings but we never find out if extraterrestrial life exists.  It seems at one point the Greys - aliens in real-life lore responsible for abductions, etc. - were cut from the games so I&#39;m rather curious if aliens from other worlds in our universe were ever to be included.</description>

            <p>Fuck the ending, the journey was pure awesomeness.</p>
<p>Also, I find Extended Cut ending just fine.</p>

            <p>Sorry for my snappy response, I seem to be pretty negative around here lately.</p>
<p>The alien in the backpack looks like it could be a variation on the alien controller, rather than being intended as a “grey”.</p>
<p>On the one hand I’d say it’s unlikely that there’s no extraterrestrial life from within the dimension in HL, as it’s basically the same world as ours at that point, and it’s unlikely that we’re the only living beings in the universe.<br>
On the other hand, after the whole combine mess, you’d expect other worlds/planets to be affected by the combine too, and so you’d expect to see some of them maybe.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, I can see why that never was finalized.  Plus, it seems to comedic like you said and similar to that Grey-looking thing in the Men In Black movie.  As for the Men In Black, in the urban legend sense who were thought, as one example, to threaten people who reported UFOs, we all know what famous Half-Life character is inspired off that.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>“Extraterrestrial” is defined as “not from Earth”.  The borderworld is not Earth so the creatures that teleport from there are extraterrestrial by definition.</p>
<p>As for “the greys”, they’re a certain kind of alien life and I don’t think they were ever considered for the Half Life universe.  We already have two fully fledged alien kingdoms (the Xenians and the Combine); I don’t think they need to add “the greys” in.  Why not Wookiees or Klingon Targs?  I think what we have now is sufficient.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Some people use the word ‘extradimensional’ to refer to beings from other universes and ‘extraterrestrial’ to refer to beings from other worlds in our universe.  As for Wookies and Targs, those were created as works of fiction and belong to specific companies/writers as opposed to Greys which are more “mythological” for lack of a better term.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the Greys were ever truly considered but apparently were at least briefly thought of.  There’s a sketch with the Valve logo here: <a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Hole_Gun" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Hole_Gun</a> that shows the Grey (or as the article refers to it, Roswell-like alien) in the backpack that supposedly was to maintain the gun.</p>
<p>My apologies if I confused anyone or didn’t make it clear regarding what I meant.</p>

<p>Yeah I know… Real life mythology (or whatever) would have been a better word.</p>
<p>Sorry about the Grey thing.  I guess they were once linked with the Black Hole Gun and were found in a backpack in the Alien Grunt.  That was kind of a bizarre idea.</p>
