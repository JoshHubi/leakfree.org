            <p>I’d post my ideas, but me being Ramirezoid I’d probably try to make them at some point and I don’t have anything trademarked yet.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of really bad comics and erotic fiction on FurAffinity that would have great film adaptations if I altered them enough.</p>
<p>One is about this rabbit guy that has a party in a haunted house, and he runs into this demon that wants to eat his genitals, so he beats it up and forces it to eat its own. The demon then reappears and castrates the rabbit guy and brainwashes him.<br>
The rabbit guy goes back to the party and castrates everyone attending, and then he and the demon leave the house and embark on a mission to castrate the entire planet.</p>
<p>Change the furries into people and the demon into some disgruntled teen rebel, and make it take place in France, in a cyberpunk future where Pepsi is sold in cartons, and you’ve got a fantastic film.</p>
