    <title>Could not load library client.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/could-not-load-library-client/9534</link>
    <description>Not sure if this error is exclusive to black mesa, but still I could really use some help.

So whenever I launch the game, it closes and gives me that error.

I have source sdk base 2007, re validated it twice, reinstalled, I reinstalled black mesa twice, countless restarts on steam and countless computer restarts. Nothing.

I managed to get the &quot;could not load library client&quot; error away a few times but then it just crashed during loading.

Also, I can play other source games just fine. I tested out HL2 Episode Two and Grey.</description>

<p>So the question is, has anyone with an Athlon XP actually run this?<br>
Lots of conflicting reports here.</p>

</aside>
<p>No it won’t. It looks like your CPU does not support SSE2 instructions. The Source Engine is heavily dependent on SSE2 operations, specifically for math calculations. As far as I know, we can’t fix this problem without recompiling the entire Source Engine (requires a license which we don’t have).</p>

            <p>I’m getting this error and followed this tip.  The game never even showed up in Steam after I restarted it.  Still getting the error.  Is there any way to play this mod?  Thanks.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">!PLEASE READ!</span></span></p>
<p>How to fix “Could not load library client.” -&gt;</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">If you’re having trouble with the “Could not load library client.” error, here’s a potential fix:</span></p>
<p>[i]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li> Go to “C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS” (this location may vary, for detailed instructions, see Note 3).<br>
</li>
<li> Open “gameinfo.txt”.<br>
</li>
<li> Scroll down to “FileSystem”.<br>
</li>
<li> Change “SteamAppId 218” to “SteamAppId 215” (without “”).<br>
</li>
<li> Save and close the file.<br>
</li>
<li> Exit and restart Steam.<br>
</li>
<li> Once Steam has restarted, there should be a “Black Mesa” entry in the library (All Games).<br>
</li>
<li> Click “Play”.<br>
</li>
<li> If it launches without any error, enjoy! If the error still persists: Exit Steam and proceed to the next step.<br>
</li>
<li> Go to “C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS”, again.<br>
</li>
<li> Open “gameinfo.txt”.<br>
</li>
<li> Scroll down to “FileSystem”.<br>
</li>
<li> Change “SteamAppId 215” to “SteamAppId 218”.<br>
</li>
<li> Save and close the file.<br>
</li>
<li> Exit (if you haven’t already), restart Steam and play the game afterwards by clicking “Play” in the library (All Games).</li>

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span></span> This one did work for me, fortunately, but please remember, this may or may not work for you and I guarantee for nothing, thank you!</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Note 2:</span></span> Simply restarting Steam after installing the game could help, too. If I were able to recreate the scenario again, I’d try to see if restarting is a possibility, but since I can’t: Feel free to drop some feedback!</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Note 3:</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Windows Vista / Windows 7:</span> To find the mod’s location, simply type “<span class="bbcode-u">BMS</span>” or “<span class="bbcode-u">sourcemods</span>” (without “”) in your startmenu’s searchfield and open the corresponding folder.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Windows XP:</span> To find the mod’s location on a Windows XP system, open your startmenu and start the “<span class="bbcode-i">Search</span>” program, then select “<span class="bbcode-i">All files and folders</span>”, type “<span class="bbcode-u">BMS</span>” or “<span class="bbcode-u">sourcemods</span>” (without “”) in the top searchfield and hit ENTER or just click “Search” and open one of the folders.</p>

<p>None of these worked for me however when trying to ‘Play’ the 2007 SDK I got the same error i.e. “Could not load library client”. Tried to repair the Steam service but still no go so removed and re-added the SDK still didn’t work however a SDK update then installed and then the game worked fine. Seems to be an issue with the SDK.</p>
<p>Enjoying the Mod very much. Thanks to the team for the awesome effort!</p>

<p>Well I don’t think the game itself is a problem but before you do further steps save your gamesave files. I didn’t bother to check that before…<br>
Rather launch the Steam, then from menu launch source SDK. Then under Utilities double-click “refresh SDK content” and after that “reset game configurations”. I’m sure that will save you ton’s of time and traffic <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Hopefuly it will work for others too.</p>

<p>Try and see if you can start Source SDK Base 2007, I could not do this and received the same error Black Mesa gave me.</p>

            <p>I installed the game without any problems and played it quite some time but yesterday it simply wouldn’t start. The error was exactly the same as the topic is named so I decided to check for solution. Here’s what I did and it worked.</p>
<p>Well I don’t think the game itself is a problem but before you do further steps save your gamesave files. I didn’t bother to check that before…<br>
Rather launch the Steam, then from menu launch source SDK. Then under Utilities double-click “refresh SDK content” and after that “reset game configurations”. I’m sure that will save you ton’s of time and traffic <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Hopefuly it will work for others too.</p>

            <p>Wouldn’t it be possible to put black mesa in another file and load it using a batch file? I don’t have any experience coding, but I know that it’s possible to run games like Minecraft with extra memory using batch files.</p>

            <p>After playing about two thirds of the game, I was given this message too. My solution was to find the Black Mesa Setup in my documents and re-install the game. My save data was still on it and it worked.</p>

            <p>I agree.  It was a beefy download, but there is zero indication that anything further is being done.</p>

            <p>When I load up BM, the mod starts for a seconds with the Loading… on the lower right followed by the game crashing and an error dialog that says “Engine Error - Could not load library client” on the screen. If I try again, I don’t even get the Loading… screen and it crashes immediately.</p>
<p>I have tried other Source engines like CS: Source with no problem. I have tried other HL2 mods and they boot fine. I have reinstalled Source SDK 2007 multiple times from scratch and even had it as the only thing installed. I even removed it completely and had BM install it when I tried to play the game. Heck, I even booted up the SDK directly and it loaded fine. Did the stress video test and everything. Still crashes.</p>
<p>I’ve verified integrity of game cache. I went into the command line and did the Steam repair. I’ve removed registry entries even close to the name BMS before reinstalling the mod. Crashes.</p>
<p>I have re-downloaded the BM mod from the torrent, file mirrors, and even Desura. The files are verified and pass the MD5 tests. I really don’t know what is causing these issues and I am curious if others are having the same.</p>
