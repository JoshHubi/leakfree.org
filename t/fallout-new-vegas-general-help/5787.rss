    <title>Fallout: New Vegas general help</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fallout-new-vegas-general-help/5787</link>
    <description>so I bought new vegas, and let me just say, it&#39;s an awesome game(: Well anyways, I&#39;ve been encountering a couple problems while playing (well, not really problems, but questions) and I was hoping you guys could help me out,so here they are.

1.if I have two of the same weapon, and say one is in mid condition,and the other is in terrible condition, which one should I repair to get a gun with best condition?

2. what quests, or where can I find the most money,that is still weak level friendly?

3.which companions are you guys finding to be the best to carry around?

4. how can I unlock ingrediants d:?

Also, please don&#39;t give out too many spoilers!

Thanks(:</description>

            <p>Not sure if this is the proper thread, but anyways.</p>
<p>As I usually do, I first torrented NV to see how it runs on my old rig, and wether it’s worth the $. Needless to say, I was convinced enough to buy it, but…</p>
<p>The biggest issue with the real thing is steam. I’ve read numerous complaints about modding difficulties with steam, that aren’t present if I just buy the boxed version. But then steam also provides constant minipatches until a final comes out, which depending on the addressed bugs can be a big bonus.</p>
<p>So which one you suggest getting? Are those small hotfixes important enough, or as with any game company, they just fix minor nuances while the gamebraking stuff is still there?</p>
<p>Or how messy is getting mods working properly with the steam version? Having a handful of custom mods already and even more downloaded, wouldn’t want to just get rid of them.</p>

            <p>ED-E is pretty nice to carry around for his perk, you will see enemies on your compass long before you can actually shoot them. can also target those damned nightkin.<br>
Veronica also seems to be incredibly powerful with her power fist, but I will probably replace her when I find someone else. though having a personal walking workbench is always nice</p>

<p>I think they both work out the same, but I usually repair the higher quality one.</p>

<li>
<p>Well, everything really scales with your level in FONV so its not a huge difference for levels, but (depending on where you are) you should go to Primm first, and after that head to the NCR Prison and massacre or help the Powder Gangers. And to find money, take every single detour possible. If I see a building, I go into it. I do every single quest I get and look in the misc tab for hints at other small quests you can do. There are also many infinite money glitches on youtube already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use ED-E and the woman you find before you reach Vegas, I don’t remember her name, lol. But ED-E is in Primm and you can repair him with 65 repair or 55 science/35 repair in order to use him as a companion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And I have a question of my own, in the Repconn Missile factory where you save or kill the ghouls (Jason Bright and friends), there’s a terminal in the Administrator’s Office and it mentions a safe and gives you a code for it. I spent about 1 hour walking through that entire building searching for the safe, but I couldn’t find it. Anyone know where it is? The note was something like “We converted that old generator room into storage, here’s the combo for the safe, 54312436243”.</p>
<p>And just to ask, who are you with? NCR, Caesar’s, or House? I’m currently debating between Caesar’s or the NCR.</p>

<p>I killed mister house on my first playthrough and took over new vegas, now I’m trying hardcore mode and I’m siding with the NCR.</p>

<p>Well, everything really scales with your level in FONV so its not a huge difference for levels, but (depending on where you are) you should go to Primm first, and after that head to the NCR Prison and massacre or help the Powder Gangers. And to find money, take every single detour possible. If I see a building, I go into it. I do every single quest I get and look in the misc tab for hints at other small quests you can do. There are also many infinite money glitches on youtube already.</p>

<p>I use ED-E and the woman you find before you reach Vegas, I don’t remember her name, lol. But ED-E is in Primm and you can repair him with 65 repair or 55 science/35 repair in order to use him as a companion.</p>

<p>What?</p>

</ol>
<p>And I have a question of my own, in the Repconn Missile factory where you save or kill the ghouls (Jason Bright and friends), there’s a terminal in the Administrator’s Office and it mentions a safe and gives you a code for it. I spent about 1 hour walking through that entire building searching for the safe, but I couldn’t find it. Anyone know where it is? The note was something like “We converted that old generator room into storage, here’s the combo for the safe, 54312436243”.</p>
<p>And just to ask, who are you with? NCR, Caesar’s, or House? I’m currently debating between Caesar’s or the NCR.</p>
