    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/speed-runs/10803</link>
    <description>hello every one, so any speed runs as of yet?
i did a speed run 30 mins ago, finished in 3:01:15(very bad time)
but thats bcoz it is a first speed run and i f.. up on alot of places and not all shorcuts figured out.
developer did a speed run in like 2:27:00 but he f.. up alot 2, but when iwatched him do the run, i did some improvments, it was harder for me also i didint rimember exat monster/soldiers spots.

if any one ask yes i finished the game on hard, nothing so hard if u use brains and are atleast experenced in this kind of fps(competitive back ground of my helps alot).


half-life 1 - speed run record 51:24 on hard(i know u can do alot alot faster record is 29 :s omthing but i always always f up on some places and stuff.)

so im here to ask any speed runs from u guys? share times.</description>

            <p>I did one in 2:44 (not including tram or loads)… not sure exactly what OBE counted, but that was just my 2nd time through. There was MUCH room for improvement. I started out really well but then became much slower during the second half. I started to forget things and get lost a bit. I still haven’t quite figured out the crazy maze that is Lambda Core. :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>That’s what speedruns are about! Get a game that lasts ten hours and finish it in one, exploiting everything you can. I can’t wait to see a good speedrun of BM.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I’ll try one myself as I finish the first playthrough, TAS run, even if I’m not good enough to speedrun.</p>
