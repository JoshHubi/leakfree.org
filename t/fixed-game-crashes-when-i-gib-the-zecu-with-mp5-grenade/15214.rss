    <title>(FIXED) Game crashes when i gib the ZECU with MP5 grenade</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixed-game-crashes-when-i-gib-the-zecu-with-mp5-grenade/15214</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m suffering a little crash from Steam version, When i gib the Zombie Grunt (or Z.E.C.U as you prefer) with the MP5 grenade launcher, the game crashes without error message.

It&#39;s frustrating because people don&#39;t save the game and it have to start the same place again. Well, that&#39;s it. Thanks and sorry my bad english, I had to use Google Translate.

Here is my specs:
Intel Celeron B800 1.5 GHz
6,00 GB RAM
250 GB HDD
Windows 7 Ultimate x64
Intel HD Graphics

EDIT: It looks like it was fixed by restarting the computer, My bad.</description>

            <p>Well, it’s understandable because it’s a laptop, not a PC. But anyway thanks to all for the help.</p>
<p>EDIT:  This only happen on my custom map, but in other maps doesn’t crash.</p>

            <p>It appears your system doesn’t meet the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/" data-bbcode="true">minimum system requirements</a> for running the game.<br>
The minimum needed is a 2.4 Dual Core Processor and a DEDICATED VIDEO CARD that has at least 1GB of memory on board.</p>

            <p>I have all the settings in low. And gibs in other NPCs works perfectly. Also i’ve gib the Zombie Grunt with many weapons and it doesn’t crash, Only with the MP5.</p>
<p>That’s weird, because i have many modern games on my integrated graphics and works perfectly.</p>

            <p>Try lowering your resolution and all of the advanced graphics settings to see if you can make it by that particular spot.</p>
<p>Integrated graphics are below the minimum recommended specs for the game.</p>
