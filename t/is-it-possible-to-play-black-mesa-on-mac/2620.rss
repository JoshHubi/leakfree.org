            <p>I guess the first question to answer is, can you figure out a way to play half life 2 on your mac? If the answer is yes, then the assumption is yes you can also play black mesa.   amirite?</p>

            <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I also use a Mac (MacBook Pro 15") because I’m a video editor!  I had the same question.  Here’s my answer:</p>
<p>You can either download a nifty little program called Crossover Games for Mac OSX, which will allow you to play any game on Steam (including mods).  It costs about 60$ or you can download the trial and find a serial crack online.  However running this program slows your processor ALOT because it tricks the computer into thinking its running Mac OSX and Windows simultaneously.</p>
<p>OR you can dual-boot your Mac with Boot Camp if you have a copy of Windows lying around, but in order to do this you must have an Intel-Based Mac and I recommend you have either Leopard or Snow Leopard as Boot Camp comes packaged with it in the Applications folder.</p>
<p>The more recent models all have GREAT specs for gaming despite the popular belief that Macs suck for games (NOT true guys, just the Mac OS does  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ).</p>
<p>I myself could run HL2 on my Intel Core Duo 2006 MacBook Pro with everything on High and Episode Two with everything on High but shadows, HDR, and particles on Medium.  Textures and Shaders could both be turned up to Very High.  It looked great, although the Superportal was missing the Bloom Effect at the top so it looked kind of crappy.</p>
<p>So basically, if you have the money I’d recommend you buy Windows and using Boot Camp dual boot your Mac.  Hope this helped!</p>

<p>Not really though, it’s just the OS, not the hardware.<br>
Also, you can get HL2 to run on OSX, so I’m sure there’s a way to get mods running as well, but it probably breaks the EULA of steam or something, so we can’t talk about it here.</p>
<p>Long story short, yes you can, but you have to use bootcamp.</p>

<p>hello, i m a new member and come from vienna (austria) and my name is ( what a surprise): franzl <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I really was impressed, when i heard about this black mesa mod, they are working on  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  great and wonderful idea! bringing hl 1 to the 21th century just is a great idea, but will this mod be compatible with a mac- based system?</p>

<p>Not unless you have a bootcamp partition or a pc emulator, not sure what the performace would be like on a emulator-type software though.</p>
<p>Why are you trying to game on a Mac anyway o0?</p>
