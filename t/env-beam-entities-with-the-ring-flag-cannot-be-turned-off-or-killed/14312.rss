    <title>env_beam entities with the &quot;Ring&quot; flag cannot be turned off or killed.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/env-beam-entities-with-the-ring-flag-cannot-be-turned-off-or-killed/14312</link>
    <description>Example of such: center_rotating_beam_ring2, center_rotating_beam_ring3, and center_rotating_beam_ring4 on the map c3a2h.

I&#39;ve been making a shutdown sequence for the lambda teleporter as part of a project of mine, and I noticed that no matter what I did the ring beams would not go away. So after trying a few other things I decided to turn off the &quot;Ring&quot; flag, which of course solved the problem.</description>

<p>I’ve been making a shutdown sequence for the lambda teleporter as part of a project of mine, and I noticed that no matter what I did the ring beams would not go away. So after trying a few other things I decided to turn off the “Ring” flag, which of course solved the problem.</p>
