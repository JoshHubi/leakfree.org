    <title>Game visual freezes after short gameplay ~1-2 minutes - sounds and gameplay seem to run fine</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-visual-freezes-after-short-gameplay-1-2-minutes-sounds-and-gameplay-seem-to-run-fine/15316</link>
    <description>I&#39;m on the public beta branch. Everytime I load any mission, the game runs a few moments and then stops at some point.
The screen freezes while sounds and gameplay seem to run fine. I can still run and shoot and hear everything but the visuals froze.</description>
