    <title>are chumtoads related to race x?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/are-chumtoads-related-to-race-x/3423</link>
    <description>just as the title says

i think they are not a xen creature but rather belong to race x.
now you may think: how can he even think that, chumtoads are the xen&#39;s prime foodsource. and you are right here the ecosystem DOES depend on these toads
but they have multiple similarities with race x
[b]1st: their single eye.[/b]
nearly all xen creatures have multiple eyes without a iris(excluding the houndeye&#39;s compound eye) where the chumtoud&#39;s eye is more similair to the shocktrooper&#39;s single eye with a iris
[b]2nd: the purple energy[/b]
chumtouds can be seen teleporting away in half life blue shift with a purple coloured energy. this is also the colour of the race x teleportation (its either that or their teleporters are chumtoad powered)

what do you think</description>

            <p>Xen is a borderworld-nothing is native to xen.<br>
Therefore, the chumtoads don’t have to be from the Vortigaunt’s homeworld to be on xen, nor the homeworld of anything else we’ve seen in the HL games.</p>

<p>Can you really consider the chumtoad as canon since it was never officially featured in the original game?  I know that’s not exactly the point of this thread, but you might as well consider all of the other critters that weren’t used but also included in the game files.</p>
<p>Ignoring this point and assuming they are canon, I’d say that chumtoads are creatures from Xen.  Why not?  Because of some differences?  Just look at the huge variety of animals on earth; why wouldn’t Xen have a huge variety as well?</p>

</aside>
<p>I got it in PDF, anyway as valve has said, none of the creatures you find in xen are from there originally, it’s a border world, a place in between worlds. Most of the creatures there were trying to escape from the combine.</p>

            <p>IMO since the chumtoad was originally made by valve, it can be considered canon and race-x is not canon, therefore chumtoad is not race-x, even though it was featured in blue shift as an easter egg.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think you’re putting way too much thought into this. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Seriously though - nice theory!  But I don’t think it’s correct.  Chumtoads also appear in the game files of Half-Life itself.  When Half-Life was released Race-X hadn’t been “invented” yet.  Race-X first appeared in the Gearbox expansion “Half-Life Opposing Force”, which came out later.</p>
<p>There’s more information on the Chumtoads in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Half-Life-2-Raising-David-Hodgson/dp/0761543643" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the book “Raising the bar”</a>.  I believe it says that Chumtoads were initially designed to be some kind of weapon like the Snarks, but were dropped somewhere in the development cycle of Half-Life.  I can recommend reading the book. It gives lots of information on the thought-process behind and development of the Half-Life &amp; Half-Life 2 games. It’s a good read if you are a fan of the series. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Update:</span>  The Combine Overwiki also has some <a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Chumtoad" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">information on the Chumtoads</a>.  Interesting part is that apparently, at one point, the Chumtoads were even designed to have six eyes. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>2 similarities is not conclusive evidence, snarks also only have 1 eye, their teleport energy is shaped differently to race x and perhaps most importantly, race x was designed by gearbox but the chumtoad was designed by valve. Also you can see chumtoads on xen in blue shift but race x doesn’t come from xen.</p>
