<p>Since it’ so much, I can’t see them doing it in the first 2-3 years from now on.</p>
<p>I bet they will have plans to prevent most mistakes they could make.</p>

            <p>Har har. I realize I go into depth about them sometimes but I like a ton of other games. At some point I will have to take a picture of my collection. 300+ games across 10 platforms.</p>

<p>It’s the content you generate for said game. There’s a whole new legal end of it if they do this. It looks good in theory, but I wonder how they’re going to manage, cleanse the stupid shit, and keep the copyright down to a minimum.</p>
<p>It’s in the future, prolly far off. Just wait and see the revised ToU.</p>

            <p>I don’t know how MUCH though.  Thing is, based on the interview and the DICE conference both of which I watched. It sounds like you can mark up the price of the game to your discretion, the thing is if you mark it up too high you are competing with other stores.  Your store would probably have to be pretty good and popular to make enough money to be worth the effort.  I imagine the people who would be most inclined to be successful at this are already existing members of the video game media.  From game jurnalizts to popular youtubers.</p>

<p>Hopefully there’ll still be a distinction between officially-vetted games and user-submitted ones. I don’t want to have to start filtering by rating when looking for games on steam.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They also talked about opening up the storefront and allowing only for “stores” selected by people.  <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Yahtzee Croshaw</a> was an example of someone who might put together a store. And it’d be games Yahtzee approved of, so basically you’d go into Yahtzee’s store and you’d look through the games he has and approves of and he would have a dictated mark up from the default steam price for the items in his store.  He’d get a percent of that back for whatever you bought as a compensation for his service to the community in gathering an interesting and useful storefront.  So you wouldn’t need a system or approval process. Your community would approve everything.  Shitty flash games wouldn’t find their way on to many stores for this reason.  Publishers would probably run stores and individual indie devs would probably too.  I doubt this would be a problem.</p>

            <p>A good idea is create an “Comunity Games” bar whith all the user created games with direct downloads to Steam, but also have the greenlight buttons with Like/Unlike, Bugs, Comments, and when a game have lots of unlike or a button like “Repetitive” or “The same flash crap” or “OriginalGameDoNotSteal” the game will be deleted innmediatly, also i hope they still in the need of pay, a bit less ($20 -$50) so you can avoid fake games and episodes 3 everiwhere.</p>
<p>Sorry for the english</p>

            <p>I don’t want Steam to become like youtube, where everything is dictated by the algorithms that try to predict what a user likes, and we end up with people buying games just because of their popularity (they end up being recommended to more and people because the search algorithm has too many positive variables) A perfect example of this on youtube is gangnam style.</p>

<p>The difference between a shitty game from an actual publisher and 70,000 shitty flash games is pretty significant, though.</p>
<p>I’m sure they know that this will be an issue and will address it in some way.</p>

            <p>To quote the first comment:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I’m curious how this shift would affect the perception of steam. I like steam in significant part because it is somewhat curated. I’m curious how they can ensure a good quality bar if it becomes as open as it sounds.</p>

<p>This is practically what my first thought was. It somehow feels like it will be too “open”.</p>
