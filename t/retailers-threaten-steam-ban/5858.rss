    <title>Retailers Threaten Steam Ban</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/retailers-threaten-steam-ban/5858</link>
    <description>Intresting little nugget of new [url=https://www.mcvuk.com/news/41746/Retail-threatens-Steam-ban]here.[/url] Apparently some retailers just realized that Steam is killing them and are not stocking Steam integrated game. Its an interesting little issue, not really because of the retailers reactions (they don&#39;t seem to have noticed retail pc gaming is long dead), but the question of a Steam monopoly, not unlike iTunes. I&#39;m fine with this, at least as of now, as Valve has a sterling record of caring about the fans, but should one company have so much power?</description>

<p>Ban? Don’t ban steam! It’s my only source of original pc games here in this damned country! I used to just play campaigns and not play multiplayer at all because I can’t go online because it’s FAKE! I don’t want to go back. I’ve just started to enjoy the community!</p>
<p>Just don’t ban steam. The retailers must think of some other way instead of “killing” their “boss rival”.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You always kill the boss, in order to win the game.</p>
<p>Also, how much did you actually read? They don’t want the games they sell to install Steam onto users computers. Basically they don’t wanna give free advertising to their biggest rival.</p>

            <p>See here is the thing, while you guys might not like the DRM and internet connection it doesn’t really matter.  Most people now have the internet.  Also most people are willing to look at the services steam provides vs the harm from drm and still consider it a bonus.</p>
<p>In fact Hakkuze the only one of your arguments that has any meaning to it is the processor and memory taken up but even that is kind of a meager amount for today’s computers and again most people don’t have an issue with it.  As far as your other arguments go offline mode is supported, auto update can be turned off and I have never had an issue with steam friends displaying incorrect info the most I’ve gotten was it being unstable and me going into offline on friends without meaning to.</p>
<p>Honestly people who dislike steam are the minority consumer and business rarely gives a fuck about the minority consumer.</p>

            <p>Well, considering the competition thing, think about Windows vs OSX. When game developers make their games steam-exclusive and use steamworks, it’s about the equivalent of software developers making their programs only for Windows - even when they could potentially work fine on a mac. (I mean software, not just games - I understand OS X doesn’t have DirectX etc)</p>

            <p>More recent games let you play without the CD as long as there is some other sort of check. COD4, for instance, removes the need for a CD if you’re playing a patched version of multiplayer.</p>
<p>And gugamilare, you are making the misconception in the first place that we want it to be all CDs. I probably couldn’t count on two hands the number of sites that have sold games over the web, rather than through physical copy. Many of them have less DRM than Steam does.</p>

            <p>Do you think having to put a CD on your drive every time you want to play a game is cool? And, of course, pray that the CD is not scratched, missing or something? Not being allowed to (legally) install the same game on more than one machine?</p>
<p>Steam allows you to play on offline mode, although from time to time you need to connect to authenticate. I really don’t see how that is bad. It is much better than all other DRM systems I know.</p>

</aside>
<p>Sorry, but Steam is not convenient in any way besides simply <span class="bbcode-i">buying </span>a game.  Forcing people to have an internent connection to play singleplayer games because they can’t “authenticate” without it is a joke.  Being unable to install and run a game without Steam is a joke.  Steam game auto-updates can be a pain when they break other games/mods without warning and cannot be undone.  Steam’s Friend system is a complete joke.  People can be displayed as in-game when they are offline, or they can be displayed as offline when in-game.  The fact that games like Just Cause 2 work exculsively with Steam is terrible because Steam, even minimized, eats processor power and memory.  If I could ditch it, I would.</p>

</aside>
<p>Here is the thing I don’t think retail has much impact on digital sales.  Most people are aware that often you can find cheaper digital versions now a days.  Not only that but retailers can’t provide the services that steam can.  With or without the case there is no competition.  For example, if there was a retail verison with case that I couldn’t connect to steam and a steam version without case that cost the same I KNOW I’d get the steam version.</p>
<p>Steam provides community features, networking, management and other things like the in game overlay that retailers simply can’t provide.  The only thing that could stop steam now is another digital distribution system.  Who stands a chance, not anyone right now.  Hopefully MS will get their shit together on Windows Live or Xfire will explode into a huge thing or Direct to Drive will provide better services or something.</p>

            <p>Tbh, Retailers can go stick a Large Porcupine up their collective arses, arrogant twats… but i digress.</p>
<p>Tbh i Agree With the point that Steam re-vived the Pc games market when Retialers gave up.</p>
<p>They all sound like toddlers wanting the toy you just packed away because they didnt want it.</p>
<p>And i think valve do an amazing job, and steam is awesome… though there is only 1 MAJOR bug with steam and valve is general…</p>

            <p>Something I just thought of: Firstly, it would be nice if the Valve Complete Pack existed as a physical collection. Second, it would be really nice if said collection came packaged in a Supply Crate.</p>

            <p>The only reason I’d ever buy a game retail is if it’s a game that install to Steam. That way I’ll be able to install faster than my internet connection would.</p>
<p>But I don’t really care, Steam is unstoppable, so they’re wasting the effort.</p>

            <p>I only buy a PC-DVD if i want the case/collectors anyway. this would in no way adhere console’s either (orange box etc.)</p>

<p>“Some of the biggest PC games – such as Call of Duty and Fallout – use Steam. [COLOR=‘Red’]But retailers are concerned that selling games with the tech built-in pushes users towards only buying games via Valve going forward.”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>First come, first served, retail would have no problem, why do they?, because we as customers go to steam, they can’t change a thing about that.</p>
<p>Besides, it’s not like steam isn’t known these days. it’s just as bad/wrong as asking not to stock xbox/ps3 games because they use there network. I’ve come to acknowledge Steam as the PC’s version of this platform/game network.</p>

            <p>It would be funny if they removed console games because the pc version is on steam, but then they would be committing suicide.</p>

<p>Steam certainly is a good place for buying those smaller or older games (midweek madness and shit), but the big ones from the HL- and Portal-series I will still buy packaged.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I disagree, I find old games I played in shops, Cesar III etc, but then again everyone played different games.</p>

<p>I bought TF2 from Best Buy for $10 and I was considering CS:S which came with DoD:S so, some of Valves games at least are a better deal in the store.</p>

<p>I lol at the smileys in the middle of the games.</p>
