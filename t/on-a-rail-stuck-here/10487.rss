            <p>not sure if this old thread is a good place to post this… I got my tram to the turntable elevator, but for some reason it hasn’t triggered it to go up.   the train is at the bottom and is deactivated, I can’t make it go forward anymore.   I’ve gone up the ladder and taken out all of the sentries but now I seem to be stuck.</p>
<p>I don’t think I have any earlier saves.   I’ve actually never seen a menu option to load a particular save!   Is there a console command or did I miss something?</p>

            <p>I am at the beginning of the rail section. When I speak to the guard who tells me to go launch the rocket. I walked into his office to check for goodies, and, well, I can’t get out. He stands next to the door and blocks the exit. I can’t push him out of the way and walk past him. The only thing that works is shooting him, which just feels, you know, wrong.</p>
<p>So, I’ll shoot him for now, but his positioning is a glitch that should be addressed in a future release.</p>

<p>Maybe … if you jump from the tram, the tram stops automatically (standard option), maybe the tram stands not exactly on the end of the elevator to activate him?</p>

<p>Sounds like you’re at the puzzle where you have to raise the rocket for launch. In order to do this you have to clear out each level of HECU and push a button on the console…so look for a ladder…and get cracking.</p>
<p>If this isn’t where you are let us know where you are with a screenshot.</p>

<p>Have you tried reloading from the previous save yet?</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s a puzzle. The control panel to lower the bridge is disabled. The water is electrified. Clearly, you must restore power to the panel, and more than likely that involves de-electrifying the water somehow. If you stop and think a moment, you should eventually come to the conclusion that, “well if the panel has no power and the water is electrified, that means the power must be getting routed the wrong way and into the water instead of the panel, no?”</p>
<p>When puzzles like this happen in the Half-Life games, usually your best bet is to ask yourself, “What is electrifying the water? Are there any wires leading from the water? If so, where do the wires lead? Can I shut it off in any way?”</p>
<p>Anyway, that belongs in the “On a Rail” thread, not the “Power Up” thread.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hey guys, I have a posivble glitch/problem. Im on the part of the level after you raise the bridge and the security door. After this there is a turn table thing that you have to raise your train with, but after I go up there I cant seem to find a switch or button to raise it. So, I countinue down the tracks untill the game says “loading”, and then I deside to turn back and head to the turn table and what do you know, the turn table had lifted up but the train is no loger on the turn table! I then went back down the ladder to find headlight/taillights from the train floating in the air. So now I have no train…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>I can’t lower the bridge. I’ve turned off the power so that I can get to the sockets on the little balcony and I assumed I’d be able to “use” them to switch the plug to the adjacent socket, but I can’t seem to do that. Am I missing something, or is it a bug?</p>

            <p>I can’t lower the bridge. I’ve turned off the power so that I can get to the sockets on the little balcony and I assumed I’d be able to “use” them to switch the plug to the adjacent socket, but I can’t seem to do that. Am I missing something, or is it a bug?</p>
<p>Edit: Never mind, I found the solution!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I’m just blind.</p>

            <p>you need to go to the end of the hall that stems from the switch that lowers the bridge, there is a ladder there, climb it and go exploring for the button that opens the door, be careful of surprise bull squid around a particular corner  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I solved the puzzle that lowers the bridge.  However, when my tram gets to the end of the bridge, it’s stopped by a red blast door, and I can’t figure out how to open it.  Help, please?</p>

            <p>Go back to the road that you crossed to get to the launch pad.  If you look left (facing away from the pad) there will be a newly opened tunnel door.</p>

            <p>I have completed on a rail and launched the rocket.  The security doors to the launch area open, making it easier to get out, then what?  I cannot find where to go!</p>
