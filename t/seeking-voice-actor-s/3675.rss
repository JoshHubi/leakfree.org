    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/seeking-voice-actor-s/3675</link>
    <description>Hello, as you may know, I am doing my own solo project on a game called Jedi Academy. It&#39;s a sequel to Jedi Knight, and what I&#39;m doing is bringing the old game back up to a more modern engine, with my own artistic direction of what would make more sense. Sort of the Jedi Knight version of BM, heh. 

Here is what I have made so far:
[url=https://forums.massassi.net/vb3/showthread.php?t=53704]Part 1[/url]
[url=https://forums.massassi.net/vb3/showthread.php?t=55819]Part 2[/url]

Anyways, what I am looking for is anyone who would be willing to do voice acting for me. I need someone who can sound similar to Kyle Katarn from Jedi Knight. Anyone else, like his pilot Jan and civilians, would be welcome but not necessary. 

[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdEthjXZg_Y]Here[/url] is a cutscene from the original game, with Kyle&#39;s voice. All the other cutscenes from the game are in the related videos section.

Thank you for your time.  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>If you make a website I’ll bookmark it and keep in touch but I can’t offer much more than knowledge at the moment.  I’d be happy to help filter through auditions, help coach, and give tips for low budget recording.  I’ve dabbled in voice acting but I’m primarily a singer and audio engineer.</p>
<p>@ Schizophriend: Yeah when my vocal teacher first had me do that years and years ago I was thinking, “the hell is this??”</p>

<p>It sounds like you’re not using your head voice at all, you need at least some reverberation in your sinuses.  You don’t need much for Kyle’s voice but make sure you can hear some slight modulation if you plug your nose while impersonating.  Another reason you’re not getting as rich a sound is you’re focusing on putting in fake gruffness in your throat rather than just dropping your voice and pulling back on the volume.  Try lowering your adam’s apple (what happens when you yawn), flatten your tongue and pull back your lower jaw when speaking (proper air flow), and relax.  This should give you a deeper richer tone.</p>
<p>Remember to relax your neck and throat and let the shape you’re holding do the work.  Forcing a low tone out will sound fake.  If you have trouble getting that gruffness (for example on “88” where your tongue comes up and restricts air flow) try pushing out your stomach the entire time while both inhaling and speaking.  This pushes your other organs out of the way so your diaphragm can work more easily.  Hopefully this action will help you keep a low volume (as to maintain the gruffness) but also be strong enough to be understood clearly.</p>
<p>Sorry if that’s not much help.  The voice is a hard thing to control.  I find realistically lower your speaking pitch is one of the hardest things to do convincingly.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve tried out a bunch of vocal stuff before, but I never tried that. I tried it today a little bit and it definitely felt a little weird at first, but I got a tone out of my voice I’ve never heard before. haha.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the help everyone. And Flubly, I really liked your critique there, I could use somebody with your experience. You put into words what I couldn’t because you actually know what you’re talking about, haha.

            <p>I said it in the original post, I need someone who can accurately portray Kyle Katarn, as shown in that video. And the release date is extremely undecided, as I am only close to complete two levels, and halfway through one. I might just release a 4-5 level demo or something, and see what goes from there.</p>

            <p>Hello, as you may know, I am doing my own solo project on a game called Jedi Academy. It’s a sequel to Jedi Knight, and what I’m doing is bringing the old game back up to a more modern engine, with my own artistic direction of what would make more sense. Sort of the Jedi Knight version of BM, heh.</p>
<p>Here is what I have made so far:<br>
<a href="https://forums.massassi.net/vb3/showthread.php?t=53704" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Part 1</a><br>
<a href="https://forums.massassi.net/vb3/showthread.php?t=55819" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Part 2</a></p>
<p>Anyways, what I am looking for is anyone who would be willing to do voice acting for me. I need someone who can sound similar to Kyle Katarn from Jedi Knight. Anyone else, like his pilot Jan and civilians, would be welcome but not necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdEthjXZg_Y" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here</a> is a cutscene from the original game, with Kyle’s voice. All the other cutscenes from the game are in the related videos section.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
