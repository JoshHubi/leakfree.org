    <title>memory card (Ink format problem)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/memory-card-ink-format-problem/12760</link>
    <description>yeah I know you will say search google, but if I didn&#39;t do that already I wouldn&#39;t bother asking here (in hopes of finding someone who had the [b]EXACT[/b] problem).

here&#39;s what I did according to many solutions? I have found...

- plugged the memory card.
- shown hidden\protected files.
- I made backup files for the exact folders on my computer.
- tried to delete the INK folders.
- I tried the CMD commands [b]attrib -h -r -s /s /d g:\*.* [/b]
- I tried the Reg fix.
- I tried Anitvirus scan
- I formatted the Card many times.


BUT they&#39;re not deleted at all ! they just keep coming back again the moment I delete them. please if someone had a past experience with this I need help with it.</description>

            <p>You can try to reformat your memory card, sometimes the USB doesn’t work, and we just need to reformat it, then we can use it. But after the formatting, the data in your USB will gone. So, I suggest you <a href="https://www.todo-backup.com/backup-resource/clone-raid.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">clone your USB</a> to another hard disk first, them format it.</p>

            <p>sounds like one of 2 things, either the partition table on your USB card is read only (happens when the USB key has too many dead sectors and is in safe mode, only intended for backup purposes) or you have the USB-key trojan horse on your computer, it tries to infect any flash drive that is plugged in, clean your PC from viruses properly and then try again</p>

            <p>The issue is probably in your registry. Do a system restore to a time previous to you ever having this issue and see if it still occurs.</p>

            <p>I think they’re actually .lnk files you’re referring to, as in LNK but lowercase. Which is a shortcut link. Not sure why formatting the card wouldn’t work though.</p>
