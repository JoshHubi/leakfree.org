    <description>Okay, so everything with my computer is working except the internet connection. It connects perfectly fine and says its connection is excellent but it&#39;s still going really slow. For example I was trying to download Firefox and it was going ~7 KB/s. It&#39;s a Linksys G wireless card.

Edit: Speed test says I should be getting about 3Mb/s download...</description>

            <p>My network is secured. It was a fresh install and the only programs I’ve downloaded are Steam and Firefox. Windows installed 42 updates before I set it up in my room.</p>

            <p>Is your wireless network secured? Did you check if someone was stealing your interwebz?<br>
You can usually see the connected machines in your router’s settings.<br>
And did you make sure no other applications are using bandwidth? Like a torrent client running in background, windows downloading a lot of updates, or something like that?</p>

            <p>Well, the packets look good. I’m getting hundreds of thousands of packets per second for the most part. Sometimes the download speeds are really good and other times they’re not. I just moved my entire Steam folder from my laptop to my desktop so I have most of the games on there already.</p>

<p>Here’s the link on how to run a router instead of a wireless card. <a href="https://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Installation" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">DD-WRT wiki.</a> I’d suggest any one of the linksys wrt54 routers. It’ll be a really long complex tutorial, but if you follow it word for word you’ll get it right on your first try, I did. Really, it’s a massive improvement over wireless cards. No drivers, no connecting to networks, no shitty 3rd party connection utilities, and best of all you can connect multiple electronics to it.</p>

            <p>wireless fucking sucks… had to struggle with it for five years</p>
<p>bought a router with 4 gigabit ports, plugged every pc in the house and goodbye signal problems and packet loss</p>
<p>also having a shared HDD with 1gbit transfer speed = epic win</p>
<p>oh and is your card using the 802.11n protocol? i never got to use it but i’ve heard it’s a lot better than the shitty stuff before it (my current router is compatible but my old wireless card isn’t, and i sure as hell won’t spend money on another one :hmph <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I say ditch the wireless card. I’ve gone through two wireless cards with nothing but trouble. Currently I have a router configured to work like a wireless card. It was a bitch to set up, but now that it’s installed my internet is faster than ever and it’s as easy to use as plugging in your ethernet cable. Also, if you have an xbox or other wired electronics you can plug them into the router as well. I bought a Linksys wrt54g for around 30 dollars. If you’re interested, I can link you the tutorial for setting it up.</p>

            <p>I am a fucking retard who just got it to work after updating the drivers. Sorry for wasting your time.</p>
<p>Edit: It was going fast for a minute or 2 and then started going slow again <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> .</p>
<p>Edit 2: But it’s going fast downloading games from Steam. I don’t understand :’( .</p>
<p>Summary: My download rate using a browser is shit while I can download fine from Steam.</p>
