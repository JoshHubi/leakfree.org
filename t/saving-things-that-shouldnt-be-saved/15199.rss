    <description>I like how the BM team has made it so you can save many of the hazard show scientists, but it still makes me sad that there are a few that have no reactions what so ever.


example the turret demonstration scientist

he has no reaction, no news or anything just sits there spewing the can not talk lines. what makes it funny is if a head crab even brushes him he will die so you would think there should be dialog or something.


here is a suggestion


Scientist: t-thanks for the save, something is wrong with our security system. (looks at his arm) I Was in the main security office when the gun activated th-the rest didn&#39;t make it out.


If guard is there


Guard: I knew that installing automatic turrets was a bad idea. 


yeah I suck at dialog ideas.


the base idea will be the scientist tell you the guns have gone haywire and that he is wounded. follow up will have him making excuses for not going forward like there being to many things in the way.





Another one that you can save that probibly should not be saved is the scientist who runs into the mine and if you blow the mine then the turrets. if you manage to destroy all hazards he will stay in the room and mess with the grunt dialog for that room causing them to open fire and kill him anyway. 



this one is pretty standard though and makes sense though personally think there should be dialog if he is alive and in that location when the military arrives.</description>

            <p>I agree; not only that the scientists you save should have some sort of reaction but that more should be savable in the first place. There are several (like one in the hallway in Unforeseen Consequences being menaced by Houndeyes, or the one the zombie throws out the window at the very end of Office Complex) that Black Mesa either made impossible to save or removed entirely.</p>
<p>As a side note, I actually managed to save at least one of the scientists in Office Complex who get pulled into the vent (by shooting him in the leg!) but was unable to reliably repeat this.</p>
