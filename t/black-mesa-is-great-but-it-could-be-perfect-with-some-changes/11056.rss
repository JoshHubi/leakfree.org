    <title>Black Mesa is great! But it could be perfect with some changes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-is-great-but-it-could-be-perfect-with-some-changes/11056</link>
    <description>Hi! Here are all the criticisms I&#39;ve seen of Black Mesa after it&#39;s release. Keep in mind, I&#39;m not saying Black Mesa is bad - just that it has some issues that prevent it from being 100%.

1. Lots of bugs
Obviously, I&#39;m sure the team is aware of this one.

2. Soldiers are way too difficult
While the team may think they&#39;re alright, I have yet to meet someone who thinks they&#39;re at the right level of balance. One issue is their reaction time is nearly instantaneous - one user reports that they start firing [i]before they turn around![/i] If nothing else, this and their accuracy need to changed.

3. Crouch-jumping shouldn&#39;t be required for EVERYTHING
The team may want to keep crouch jumping in, but right now it is required for jumping over ANY surface. To new FPS players, crouch jumping is extremely difficult - so perhaps there should be an &quot;auto crouch-jump&quot; option in the menus?

4. Ichysaurs are too easy
They can be killed with two crossbow bolts, and I believe one clip from a pistol. They&#39;re not nearly as scary as they were in Half Life.

5. Tentacles seem weird
It&#39;s impossible to sneak past them, and grenades seem to distract them only momentarily. 

Anyone got any others?</description>

            <p>First of all, I think the grenades in the mp5 are a bit hard to “control”. Second of all, I think the reload time for it should be slightly shorter, and also maybe nerf the soldiers. The mp5 would become more effective against them.<br>
Yeah, bringing up soldiers - I think they “spot” you too easy but on some occasions, say there were two HECU’s beside each other. I headshoted one with the magnum, and the second one didn’t even turn around. So yeah, I think the soldiers should be a bit more balanced, though still a tough enemy.</p>

<p>I don’t mind the sea monsters being made much easier. They were scary for me the first time, maybe the second, but after that they simply became a pain. Your weapons don’t work underwater except the crossbow, and that’s inaccurate at a distance. The pistol works, but it’s not very powerful. Plus, you’re fighting underwater, which means limited mobility and a limited air supply.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That doesn’t count for shit if you can kill them easily though. Plus the water is no longer as murky as it was in hl 1, to make the challenging you have to up their health and fill the water with some dirt and sand clouds.</p>

            <p>So… Why are people complaining about the final fight in Questionable Ethics? I did that entire chapter in one life after taking damage for being an idiot and not killing the Houndeyes at the start immediately. The finale of that chapter is a beautiful example of the kind of tactics a real military squad would use to corner an opponent who’s proven exceedingly dangerous, namely: cut him off from friendlies, send in a flanking ground-force and have soldiers rappel in from above, ready to fire, if they tank it then send in another flanking force from the far side and make sure to have the arresting soldiers up top be ready to open fire as soon as the target pops out into their line of sight.</p>
<p>Beautifully executed and just difficult enough to make it worrying, but not so much so that it got frustrating. I didn’t even die -once- and walked out with about 70 or so health and 20 or so armour before I used the charging stations in the same room. I even managed to arrange a badass motif moment as the scientists and security guard came up from the door as Gordon reloaded the crossbow. It was perfect, and really made the dialouge from the scientists/security guard fit, especially after the frantic action just before and the difficulty thereof. It also further cements the reasoning behind the reactions of the Resistance in Half-Life 2 being so pleased/amazed/ecstatic for at least some of the scientists/security guards to have seen Gordon Freeman completely obliterate amazing odds without taking much damage from it.</p>
<p>I figure I should include a bit of synopsis of how I got past this section so simply. So! Coming in from the door after the scientists let me in, I immediately used the Shotgun’s alt-fire to kill the two rappelling soldiers, then booked it over to the crates to the right-side rear of the desk for the two ammo dumps from the soldiers that you can kill in that room. Then, sprinted to the exit door by the charging stations. I used the minor unidirectional cover there to get an easier bead on the soldiers who enter from the left side (from the door you come into that room from) and killed them with the MP5 and a shot from it’s alt. Then I killed the others across the room with the MP5 from the same spot. To finish I ran back to the center of the room to cover behind one of the two big pillars, readied a shot, then stepped out from the side and killed the two up top with a quick pair of shots from the crossbow, I even missed the first shot. Finally, I moved back to stand at the top of the entrance ramp, reloading the crossbow as the door finished rising. In come the scientists to see a bloodstained, reloading, scowling Gordon Freeman with lifeless Marine Grunt corpses littering the floor around the room.</p>

            <p>That’s not an argument, that’s a fact. If HL1 was better than BM is, then there wouldn’t be any point in the remake and you could consider it a failure. I’m currently replaying HL1, other than having some areas that were cut with BM intact, I’m yet to see anything better about it. It’s flaws show just now, I’m playing on Hard and I’m yet to die, not to mention I have Python with full ammo most of the time (36!!! quite unbalanced) most of your posts are very against this mod.<br>
Of course it’s not flawless, but it’s the only remake around, so either get used to it or play HL1 still.</p>

            <p>I do apologize for being ignorant of the facts surrounding Surface Tension. I would remark that this mod did take a rather long time to be completed and so one was inclined to forget to check up on it. It didn’t seem to be very productive to keep up on the latest gossip when it yielded the same “We have always gone for a when it’s done approach…” for six years. Not a complaint, mind you, but explanation.</p>
<p>That said, I still stand by my concern that BMS’s editing of HL1 maps may have undermined the tension that was at the heart of HL1. A lot of places that I am fairly sure were full of enemies in HL1 are disturbingly empty in BMS. A lot of those simple but deadly puzzles/traps also seem to have been replaced or removed. I am fairly sure one did a lot more jumping and pushing crates around to reach hard spots in HL1 than they do in BMS.</p>

            <p>Never surprises me when somebody complains about something without knowing what the fuck they are talking about.</p>
<p>Regarding Surface Tension, it is stated in probably 50 places on these forums that a team member left and they had to shorten that particular chapter.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/genericplayerx">@GenericPlayerX</a> Don’t think this as a full version game just yet, I imagine things will look a bit different (including Surface Tension) when the patched version releases.</p>

            <p>My only complaint with the mod is that sometimes, the edits that have been made to the original HL1 maps have gone too far. I understand the argument that some parts were “tedious” and I definitely agree that the damned waiting for the big yellow robot on the tram-ride at the start is just pointless.</p>
<p>However,  it is another thing to cut down one of the best maps of the game, Surface Tension, by 25% or more. I can kinda forgive the deleting the tentacle monsters from the desert before the minefield, but harder to understand why the helicopter was cut from that area as well. It was fun dodging helicopter fire from rock to rock, while headcrabs and tentacle monsters threatened. It was tense and fun. Now, that whole part of the map is fairly quiet and except for a brief shootout with marines, not very lethal.</p>
<p>And eliminating the entire map between the Auto Repair Shop where the grunts shoot the air ducts and the Gargantua chases you through the Parking Garage is a huge loss to the game IMHO. I loved using the big gun to blast a hole into the warehouse, then running and gunning through said warehouse as a Bradley Fighting Vehicle busts in the wall and aliens teleport in all over. I loved dropping through the ruined building as alien grunts and headcrabs continually surprise. I loved high-jumping onto a roof to drop into a pipe where a firebomb is dumped in your face. It was most satisfying to lead the rescued security guard to that door and watch him keypad you into your meeting with Gargantua. I cannot imagine how any of that could be considered “tedious.”</p>
<p>In simple terms, a lot of the maps that have been heavily edited feel a lot less intense and threatening than they were in HL1. I don’t feel rushed or afraid of being hurt. It is one thing to joke “it’s quiet, too quiet…” and another to have it literally be too quiet.</p>
<p>{Edit}</p>
<p>I partially revise my comments above by noting that someone has attempted to fix the Surface Tension map and I hope the fix works. Nevertheless, Surface Tension is not the only map with the problem I described so this post is still valid, excluding the Surface Tension part.</p>

<p>It’s just not very realistic or fair. I’d imagine that the enemy soldiers in general still have some sort of self-preservation and that they would probably throw grenades to flush you out rather than run at you from point blank range and start firing in your face while taking a million bullets themselves.</p>
<p>This is why I suggested them running from cover to cover trying to advance on your position. Yes they are out to kill you and rush you down, but they also don’t want to die either, so they shouldn’t just run up to you until they have a line of sight and then stop and start firing.</p>
<p>There are other mpre realistic ways to make AI challenging, but the way they behave now is quite farfetched</p>

<p>Thank you very much. Hey, that should considered at some sort of bugfix, since people complaining about the HECU reaction time being too fast.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I’m at Surface Tension in Black Mesa, and I do have to say, incredible job developers. Having never played Half Life 1, this was a great way to start it off for me.</p>
<p>There honestly has only been one thing that has been bugging me, and it’s the AI, especially the enemies’ (the allies’ AI doesn’t need to be that complicated, although when my ally decided to open fire on 6+ soldiers instead of waiting for me to take the first shot, I was pretty ticked).</p>
<p>I’m playing on Hard (like I do with every FPS), and it seems like the AI can be brokenly unfair at times. They seem to have no waypointing, and I noticed the general trend of the enemies spotting you from a mile away, standing in place and then shooting you with almost pinpoint accuracy, never bothering to take cover except for the occasional reload. It gets REALLY frustrating when there are numerous enemies, because if you try to hide or camp them out, they all run towards you until you are in their line of fire and then they just stand there and open fire. This gets to be pretty aggravating when playing on hard and enemies don’t die as easily, because while you are hiding in a corner, they all run in front of you and fire at you, while you can’t kill them fast enough before you die or need to reload (resulting in a death). Every time you move out of their line of sight, they approach you until they can start firing again.<br>
After this, it turns into constant backpedaling to prevent them from appearing 2 feet in front of you to fire at point blank range. Because of this trend where the AI must constantly have line of sight with you, it feels like I never get a chance to reload or switch weapons without them chasing me down.</p>
<p>My suggestion is instead of bee-lining to the player if the AI doesn’t have a direct line of sight, maybe have the enemy move from cover to cover, then pop out to fire and pop back in to reload.</p>

            <p>Certainly an improvement. By not hearing him like he is right up in your fucking grill -  mere inches away - it feels much less retarded and way less amateurish… obnoxiousness levels have been diminished tenfold. I still think the tiniest bit of reverb/echo could go a long way. You are never in a room with those a-holes that has carpeted walls and full of soft sofas etc… they only seem to appear in places that would produce at subtle echo - at a minimum. Cutting the volume by 50-70% across the board would be a great idea as well – as I mentioned above… imho of course.</p>
<p>Alas, I will be sticking with my muted BM nonetheless… I love it too much now to have anything but… now I just hope I get a chance to play again in near future… too much f-ing work.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
