    <title>Patch 0.0.2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/patch-0-0-2/14082</link>
    <description>The new patch is released! Introducing Black Mesa [b]0.0.2![/b]

This is a much larger patch than the last one. We hope that this patch has resolved most of the serious performance issues and stuttering in multiplayer. See the full changelog below:
[quote]
[u][b]PROGRAMMING CHANGES[/b][/u][/size]

* Performance fixes: Dynamic lights removed from muzzle flashes and explosions. These were causing stuttering and performance issues in MP, which should now be fixed. Dynamic light options removed from menu as they no longer do anything.
* Loading screens: Our flashy loading screen system now works properly for MP on secured servers (the majority of servers). Previously they only worked on unsecured and listen servers. Also made some updates to the loading screens&#39; appearance to make them a bit nicer.
* Spawn system: Fixed all players penetrating each other to death over a single spawn point during round resets.
* Chat box exploit: Fixed a recently discovered bug which affects all Source games and allows players to execute commands on all players using the chat box, potentially crashing the server.
* Tripmine hitbox: Doubled the size of the Tripmine hitbox to make it easier to shoot.

* Added visible glow to silo door button to indicate it is usable if the scientist is killed.


[b]Blast Pit[/b]

[u]Map A (bm_c1a4a)[/u]

* RPG in the river is now above the water, so it can be seen by players.
[/*:m][/list:u]

* Fixed some of the pipe corner props so they are properly made of metal, insead of plastic.

<p>They said it dynamic light was removed due to performance issues. And they will return to it (to fix it). And I hope they’ll really do this. (Someone correct me if I’m wrong)</p>

<p>This seems to be a framerate issue… either if its too high or too low. We will be addressing it.</p>

            <p>Not sure if I should leave feedback here or not, figured I would since it’s patch specific.</p>
<p>The crowbar is really unforgiving right now in single player. Trying to kill a zombie is insanely hard. Before it’s range was too long, now it feels too short. Maybe a happy medium is needed?</p>

<p>Okay, thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>I’m now trying to send overlays via r_screenoverlay, but it looks like the game itself is consistenly sending overlays which overwrite my overlays. Why is that so? Can’t we use custom overlays on our servers?</p>

            <p>I can definitely echo the performance issues. I don’t have too much in the way of framerate hiccups, but there’s a lot of “lag stutter” going on. Usually my ping is between 50 and 100, but it feels way higher than that.</p>
<p>I think this is a big part of why the Gluon gun seems so unbalanced. It ends up feeling like the damn thing is completely unavoidable. Not fun.</p>
<p>EDIT: I see your dislike there, person-who-I-won’t-point-out. No, I’m not saying “Nerf the Gluon gun, it’s OP,” I’m saying that I think the performance issues in MP are part of why some people are finding it hard to deal with. Even if that <span class="bbcode-i">isn’t</span> the case, that doesn’t change the fact that the performance bugs in MP are definitely not fun to deal with.</p>

<p>Nope,  it is not server related (you can see it keeps 64upd rate constant in net_graph 1), i can also post some net_graph 4 screens if you would like, or you could come test it yourself any time you wish, you will find it behaves exemplary.</p>
<p>The issue happens on official servers as well, it happens everywhere and on any map when the player count is high.</p>

<p>As i’ve mentioned earlier in this post and in another post previous to this patch being released; this game runs Very bad when a lot of players are online, i (and everyone else i know that has black mesa, no single exception) suffer from extremely low fps, constant stutter and constant freezes.</p>
<p>I’ve took a screenshot of CPU + GPU usage while playing so you can see the hardware is not even close to being maxed out, please consider having game performance optimizations as a top priority.</p>

<p>agree with the above<br>
unbearable lags occur depending on how many players are on the server<br>
also the lags seem pretty random, not directly related to open/narrow/crowded areas, it’s just very choppy everywhere and reconnecting usually fixes the issue for a short period of time<br>
i7 4790k, GTX980, 16gb ram, Win 8.1 x64<br>
will report back with detailed screenshots of hardware load if need be, don’t have any monitoring utility handy (my graphics card’s fan won’t speed up while gaming so…)</p>
