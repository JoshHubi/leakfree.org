<p>I wouldn’t worry about the things these guys have posted too much Striker. They obviously don’t have clue what a short film is or that it was done on a budget of (was it) $1200 or $1800, it has been a while since i read the notes. I guess most kids think that all fims should be done with a multi-million pound budget and last close to 2 hours and have the latest and best actors involved.</p>
<p>This is a bunch of students showcasing thier talents as film makers, with a budget most kids get as pocket money in a year (and some kids in less than a year).</p>
<p>Personaly i think they did a great job, glad to see they actually won at the Film Festival.</p>
<p>Also i would like to know how it is changing the story of Half-Life, it is focused on what happens to Adrian Shepherd after the war, it does not have Gordon Freeman in it at all. What? you think the the world just stops, just because Gordon is not around? Oh yes wait, or course the whole game revolves around Gordon, so in your eyes it must just stop because he’s not around (sigh). It changes nothing.</p>
<p>Seriously, sometimes you guys just need to step back and think about what it is your complaining about before you actualy type anything.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I didn’t like it because I think it has boring narrative, monotonous action, and an underwhelming setup. That has nothing to do with budget or acting talent.</p>

            <p>for me, I think he isn’t vey young to do the paper of Shepherd but it would had been cool see him with his H.E.C.U. Uniform instead of rebel robes.</p>

            <p>Well I don;t think he looks too young, I think he doesn’t really seem like the Marine type and look at the guns Adrian carried, they are pretty heavy and would need a very strong person to lug around. Even if he just used one of the weapons just walking with it that far would make you need to be strong.</p>

<p>Oh and from the trailer it doesn’t look real great but I’ll still watch it to see how it is. Trailers often don’t accurately reflect the movie they advertise.</p>
