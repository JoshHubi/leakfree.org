    <title>Empty map = noisy PC fan?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/empty-map-noisy-pc-fan/15113</link>
    <description>I can play Black Mesa without any problems on the highest settings and my system surpass the system requirements.
But after playing aound a bit with the hammer editor and testing a map ingame, I noticed that my pc fan starts  to spin very loud. I just created a small empty room with nothing inside. Also modifying the graphics settings changed nothing.
Is this a normal behavior?

I&#39;ve tested the map in other source games like Half-Life 2 and there this issue doesn&#39;t occur.</description>

I’d say that something on the map is causing your GPU to heat up quickly, so it has to spin it’s fans faster to keep cool.<br>
I don’t know Hammer at all, but try to make the same thing from scratch. And keep track of what you’ve done to make the map.<br>
Find the source of the problem.</p>
