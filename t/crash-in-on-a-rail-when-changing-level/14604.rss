    <title>Crash in &quot;On a Rail&quot; when changing level</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-in-on-a-rail-when-changing-level/14604</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, whenever I board the yellow tram in the &quot;On the Rail&quot; level to finish that level, my game crashes shortly after the &quot;loading&quot; message for the new level appears. I tried many tips on the forum (e.g., driving slower, letting the tram drive while not being on it, etc.), but none of this works. I also got to the end of the level using noclipping and tried to change the level from there, which also resulted in a crash. Also, checking the integrity of the installed files did not help either. Can you please help me? Thanks.</description>

            <p>Thank you for your help. Loading older save games did not work either. I just loaded the next map then and it worked.</p>

            <p>It might be your save game.It happened to another user as well.<br>
Every object (barrel, coffee mug, crate, etc.) that you can move is spawned when a map is loaded.<br>
So naturally some objects can spawn incorrectly, causing a crash.</p>
<p>Simply try either:</p>
<ol>
<li>loading a save game before the last one.If failure again, load one before that one.</li>
<li>If you have no more saves to load, start the chapter again.</li>
<li>You can try loading the map in the console command, but that is for last resort.</li>
</ol>
<p>To use the 3rd option:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Option’s menu, go to Controls, then click Advanced.Then check the Console box.</li>
<li>Open the console command menu by clicking the cedilla key (its above the Tab and below the Esc key)</li>
<li>Then write down for example “load bm_c1a0a” to load a map. <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/16538-A-map-of-BM-s-Black-Mesa-Research-Facility/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-u">Thread for all the maps in BM.</span></a>
</li>
</ol>
