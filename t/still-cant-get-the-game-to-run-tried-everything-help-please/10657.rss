<p>So after downloading from the torrent you should have a folder that looks like this<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/9/1/91249d06e92502ad4d7c061bc5f6d4c5999b0013.png" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/91249d06e92502ad4d7c061bc5f6d4c5999b0013" title=""><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/9/1/91249d06e92502ad4d7c061bc5f6d4c5999b0013_2_690x165.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="kHZFYweQiv67DuzOyKnyU2A6wfx" width="690" height="165" srcset="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/9/1/91249d06e92502ad4d7c061bc5f6d4c5999b0013_2_690x165.png, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/9/1/91249d06e92502ad4d7c061bc5f6d4c5999b0013.png 1.5x, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/9/1/91249d06e92502ad4d7c061bc5f6d4c5999b0013.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/3X/9/1/91249d06e92502ad4d7c061bc5f6d4c5999b0013_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">691×166 26.1 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>Double-click the exe file. If you say it doesn’t let you, at least tell us what error it gives.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s completely up to Valve to prepare it for Steam distribution. It could be next week, it could be next month, who knows.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you want to play now, re-download the torrent and run the executable. That’s it. Restart Steam and download the SDK Base 2007 and it will be right there in your library.</p>
<p>If you encounter any issues again (which, you really shouldn’t… the non-steam install process literally consists of double clicking the installer and hitting next :facepalm <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  just throw a screenshot up here and I’m sure everyone will gladly offer more concrete advice.</p>

<p>After you download it from the torrent, all you should have to do is run BlackMesa-Setup.exe.  No moving files or anything like that, since with the torrent BlackMesa.7z and BlackMesa-Setup.exe will already be in the same folder.  The installer should take care of the rest.</p>

</aside>
<p>I already deleted the files awile ago because I gave up after days of trying every link. The torrent one was the most recent one I tried and that didnt work either. What I did was I downloaded both of the files. Then after both of them wouldnt open I tried moving them to the same folder. I managed to get some of the files opened like the loading screen or the pictures of the zombies/ Black mesa logo or whatever but those dont matter. I tried moving the Tracker file but that didnt work then I realized that the Setup file was supposed to open that for me. So I moved the Setup file to the same folder and I managed to open it somehow and I tried to install it. So while it was installing it comes up with an error message saying “could not find file” like last time. So Im gonna just wait for steam. But I cant wait much longer though because Im dying to play this game. Everyday I check on steam to see if its available to download and theres nothing there. :’(</p>

            <p>I tried every single download link and tried everything and nothing worked so I hope this game comes to steam like towmorrow or a couple days because I wanna play this game so bad and if its on steam then there wont be any downloading/installation issues. This game needs to get on steam ASAP!</p>
