    <title>Importing HL2 Weapon Skins and models into Black Mesa?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/importing-hl2-weapon-skins-and-models-into-black-mesa/11474</link>
    <description>I thought It could be beneficial to explore this topic with people far more knowlageable than myself.

Basically there are alot of skins available for Half Life 2 models that I would perhaps like to use in Black Mesa.

But there are issues with porting over models and their animations apparently because of.

1, The field of view is completely different

2. The Hands model is rigged differently

3. The Physics are server side (That&#39;s why grenades don&#39;t act like they do in Half Life 2)

Now seeing as the Magnum and crow bar are using the same model from Half Life 2 then surely it is possible to port over the weapon models? and use either originals or re-skins

Also is it possible to port over the hands model from Half life 2 out of curiosity and will this work with the current animations that are in place in Black mesa such as the glock idle animation and the crossbow animations.

Basically I just want to know how it can be done or if it can be done... There is a lot of good skins out there already available and would be a shame to lose these as a resource for re-skining weapons or reverting to Half life 2 defaults.

can you force physics client side via a cvar and see what effect this has on the game?

anyone know about this stuff?</description>

<p>Well sorry but I didnt find BMS hands that are all clumzy and bloated looking any better than hl2.</p>
<p>I think that work that Valve did with hands and weapon models and their anims. is in many times still better than what can be seen in other newer games, in sence of feeling.</p>
<p>Unrealistic? yes agreed: mp7 with semi automatic 20mm greandelauncher visualised as another 4.6×30mm barrel Is nonsence (Valve should have kept OICW) and yes Spas-12 has no 2 barrels, lower “tube” is oviously magazine. Crossbow cocks it self automaticly and etc.</p>
<p>Yes it is lowpoly and maybe lowres, in comparsion with BMS, but shiny texures and ton of polygons never ever in any game compensated for, blank noninteresting feeling of anims, or anathomical disproportions.</p>
<p>BMS did inovate, but not the same in all departements, it has Ultra quality sounds and awsome shaders, and high ploly models,and bazilion x bazilion texture resolution,  but animations and some leveldesign are far back behind that AAA quality, therefor getting back to HL2 stuff is not nesecerly a bad thing.</p>
<p>I for example totally dont understand that ironsight tiral on 357 or their head bob, or angeling of view during strafing, or so detailed chargers on blank walls. Those things are un-needed inovations, which with several others, are driving BMS feel away from hl2 to entirly stand alone feeling. It doesnt feel like it belongs to hl family. its more like SIN source - in meaning of something cool but not half-life anymore</p>

            <p>i think that the shotgun animation from HL2 felt better than the one of BM,the same with the crowbar,  Though the models port seems unnecesary.</p>

            <p>Can you post us the files to that Shotgun? Either that or someone takes the BMS Shotgun and remodels it with the stock folded, I just prefer a folded stock, I think it’s awesome!<br>
I would love a remodeled or reskinned BMS Crossbow too but I can’t find one anywhere, any ideas where to look fellas? I found this forum while searching for a new skin on the web.</p>

            <p>I have this now too in BMS so check he previous post.</p>
<p>It looks like HL2 at 54 but it’s not right for BMS if you catch my drift</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>*</p>
<p>The Camera needs dropping down and bringing forward on the HL2 Decomiled model and then recompiling In my opinion to make this work like the BMS models.</p>
<p>It’s all about the hand size… The Camera is not close enough or low enough to the V_hands in the rigged animation</p>
<p>So the camera needs bringing forward and down and apply the FOV “54” in the  script after the recompiled HL2 crowbar model applying the BMS Textures or Alpha texture overlay skin</p>
<p>OK I think that an 8 bit alpha needs applying to the normal vtf skins to make them work as in BMS on the normal tagged VTF but I am not sure on this</p>
<p>Can this be done in studio compiler texture in VTF edit.</p>
<p>Or the straight swap might work too as it is the same .mdl in this case</p>
<p>The shotgun material will need 8 bit alpha applying in VTF edit?</p>
<p>*** 2nd Update***</p>
<p>It’s not the 8 bit alpha in the normal material vtf</p>
<p>Ok I think I found it!</p>
<p>$detail=effects/models/model_blood_red.vtf<br>
$detail scale=5<br>
$detailblend factor=0.0<br>
$detailblendmode=0</p>
<p>proxies - ModelDetailFx</p>
<p>This needs to be added for the detail effects string on all VMT’s not VTF’s</p>

<p><em>edit</em></p>
<p>To get this looking more Black Mesa and less half life 2 I think the HL2 model needs de-compiling and then re-compiling with a different camera position</p>
<p>This might also need checking out what the decompiled BMS crowbar Camera position is at</p>
<p>If it is the same then it is a fov value only</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT (03:21 PM):</span></p>
<p>The blood seems to be specified in the .vmt file(s), I’ll try adding the section from a default BMS vmt to the imported one, then report back with the results (as usual).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT (03:02 PM):</span></p>
<p>I was going to edit the image and add a marker to it, but I am pretty sure you’ll spot it on your own:</p>

<p>Looking at the ‘<span class="bbcode-i">Mini-Crowbar</span>’ - changing the fov value in the script file could “fix” things, at least temporarily.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’d make a video about the (apparently) working animations, if my connection wasn’t going to choke 'n puke as soon as its workload reached a certain point, causing the entire connection to drop down to a minimum down- and up-rate…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>so if you change the FOV does this fix the crowbar in the script for size or does it act weird?</p>

<p>Could you specify “fix” in a little more detail?</p>
<p>If by “fix” you mean the HEV suit’s arms, then no - not really, they’re still cut off at a certain point (screenshot coming in a little while).</p>
<hr>
<p>As for the animations, they seem to be working properly - could just be me imagining things, though.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>so if you change the FOV does this fix the crowbar in the script for size or does it act weird?</p>
<p><em><strong>Updated</strong></em>*</p>
<p>Ok no if you change the field of view to 54 it looks normal but you lose the blood from the crow bar.</p>
<p>Is this part of the texture? Like a feature set of the texture?</p>
<p>As it is the same model I wonder if only changing the materials to the BMS ones will enable the blood back on the crowbar model?</p>
<p>I have lost these files can you try this one out?</p>
<p>Also I assume the shotgun you put in no longer has blood on it I wonder if this an alpha skin on top or something?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What is weird about this is it rigs the hand to the mini crowbar because it is the same model so I gues if you specify a custom fov then does the hand grow in size also?</p>
<p>I cannot understand why It did not work for me is there any other files apart from Model and the materials forgetting the sound that i need to import over?</p>
<p>Thanks alot for all this help Jen I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Changing over the .Phy file does not seem to have any unusual effects I think it does make physics a bit more resposive but I have edited my config so going to revert back to defaults and give another try now</p>
<p>*** UPDATE ***</p>
<p>Replacing the .phy of the headcrab from HL2 puts it’s physics back client side</p>
<p>So probably safe to assume that this is the same for the world model grenade so making some headway here</p>

<p>(It’s probably handled in a hardcoded way and thus takes its instructions from one of the .dll files [client.dll or server.dll would be my bet, I could be wrong, though])</p>

<p>Ok, so I managed to get the HL2 crowbar into BMS, including HL2’s animations, although it looks a bit weird (in terms of surface properties - it looks like some sort of plastic).</p>
<p>Adjusting the fov via the script file did work, as well.</p>

<p>Was it a straight copy for the shotgun or did you have to decompile and recompile adjusting this?</p>
<p>As for the Crowbar seems like the issue is with the way the hands are rigged… Texture problems might be to do with DX level or HDR / reflective surface perhasps? missing the hdri environment As for the hands sounds like it would need to be rigged to the animation.</p>

            <p>Ok, so I managed to get the HL2 crowbar into BMS, including HL2’s animations, although it looks a bit weird (in terms of surface properties - it looks like some sort of plastic).</p>
<p>Adjusting the fov via the script file did work, as well.</p>
<p>I’ll take a look at the .vmt files and see if I can somehow change the overall ‘<span class="bbcode-i">plastically</span>’ looking textures.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT (08 : 35 AM):</span> Imported the shotgun (SPAS-12) model you posted into BMS, including it’s materials and sounds - it seems to be working, but the muzzle-flash is missing, unfortunately.</p>
<p>If you want to try it yourself, don’t forget to rename the sound files (.wav) to the corresponding files BMS uses (based on hearing), before copy and pasting or moving them into BMS’ folder.</p>
<p>Listen to them first, then rename them, if they ‘<span class="bbcode-i">match</span>’.</p>
<hr>
<p>Also, would you mind telling what exactly you are trying to accomplish by changing the physic’s properties (are you trying to use HL2’s physics, etc.)?</p>

            <p>Do you know anything about Changing the physics properties of npc_headcrab and grenade_phy</p>
<p>Basically they are now server side where as in HL2 they were client side… Is there a command that can change this in the scripts for grenades and headcrab classic?</p>
<p>I assume the same scaling settings have been applied to npc’s also? or can it be a straihjt swap on this to change the physics info?</p>
<p>Some suggestions of models to use</p>
<p>Crowbar original</p>
<p>shotgun by lamarr<br>
<a href="https://gamebanana.com/hl2ep2/skins/47835" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gamebanana.com/hl2ep2/skins/47835</a></p>
<p>Grenade by Kaskad MKII Grenade</p>
<p>Or even swap out the MP5 for the M4 or import the AR2 with a M4 Skin</p>
<p>Obviously getting there permission first if a pack could be made</p>

<p>Basically there has to be a formula to porting over the weapons from HL2 to Black Mesa but I think the Model needs decompiling from HL2 then recompiled under Black Mesa Settings?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, I tried de- and re-compiling it both either way (using StudioCompiler), but neither seemed to work…</p>
<p>(The viewmodels are completely invisible.)</p>
<p>Maybe I am doing something wrong here?</p>
<p>It could have something to do with the way the .qc file’s set up.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ll try it again, while paying attention to what I actually do, then report back with the results.</p>
