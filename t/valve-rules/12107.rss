    <title>Valve Rules!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/valve-rules/12107</link>
    <description>The Title says it all. I made a similar thread a few years back when valve released steam for OSX. Now they have done it again for linux. They are taking gaming where few companies have dared to tread and trying to keep gaming open. Although I am still waiting for the next HL installment, the steam release is another great step for gaming and yet another reason why valve rules.

            <p>Eh I don’t think its that Valve rules so much as so many other companies with money to throw around suck.  Valve is a privately owned company so it doesn’t have the problems that will prevent EA or Activision from ever being great companies in that as a stock driven company they are more concerned with pleasing shareholders than customers which is a backwards ass way of doing business.</p>
<p>Valve does this and profits from it in many ways as a business.  Buzz / advertizing from hype and gaming news doing this.  Wider audience to sell games to. Lastly not having to worry about Microsoft moving toward a closed platform fucking them over.  Its just while Valve wins you also win.</p>

            <p>What’s a Valve rule?</p>
<p>I’m actually not very Linux-competent, but I’m assuming this is pretty big.</p>
