<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony</a><br>
“Irony (from the Ancient Greek εἰρωνεία eirōneía, meaning hypocrisy, deception, or feigned ignorance) is a situation, literary technique, or rhetorical device, in which there is an incongruity or discordance that goes strikingly beyond the most simple and evident meaning of words or actions. Verbal and situational irony is often intentionally used as emphasis in an assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, irony used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes may involve the emphasis of one’s meaning by deliberate use of language that states the direct opposite of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.”</p>

<p>Oh internets… I think this whole forum (and 99% of forums, minus the last part) boils down to “I’M RIGHT, I HAVE A BIGGER INTERNET PENIS, YOU’RE WRONG. Oh, and HL is kewl”</p>
<p>…actually make that 99% of the internets that is not porn…</p>

<p>You’re also forgetting that Valve would be nothing without, say, numerous other FPS producers. Perhaps id Software, 3D Realms and some others would remind you of classic FPS games like Wolf3D, Doom and Duke Nukem 3D before Half-Life. Sure HL was highly superior with advanced storytelling and simply amazing scripted events, but you must go back to the basics if you truly love FPS games.</p>
