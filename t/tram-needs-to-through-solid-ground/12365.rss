    <description>Hi,

Found a little &#39;bug&#39;, I don&#39;t know if the devs gonna fix this...

![](upload://6I6PuuEmauXO02up6hgyYXrei26.jpeg)

So the tram grips around the bar, but at this point, the &#39;arm&#39; of the arm goes through the solid ground (metal bridge)

Maybe, change it in a bridge sliding together when tram has passed....</description>

            <p>You noticed that but not the fact that half the tram levitates when it gets to an angled track?</p>

<p>Pretty much, or even seeing it for that long to make it worth making any adjustments to the map.</p>
