    <title>Crysis load screen crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crysis-load-screen-crash/2427</link>
    <description>I bought Crysis, and played through half the game before I had an error. The game crashed when it was saving, and I had to exit out. From that moment on when ever I go to Singplayer&gt;load (game) on the in game menu the game crashes on the load menu. After some research I found a forum that discussed the problem and diagnosed it as a corrupted saved file. The person recommended going to the saved games folder,making a copy of it (to back it up incase things go wrong) and then remove the suspected saved game file. Theres only one problem. The folder directory is different for the steam version of the game. There is no &quot;saved games&quot; file. So I was hoping someone might know the either the file type or the location of the saved games folder.</description>

            <p>Yeah, you were right. I feel like a retard now. I didn’t know that there was a file for crysis outside of the steam directory. I did a search for the file name and it came up. I found the save files and deleted the corrupted one and now everything works just fine. Thanks!</p>

            <p>There has to be saved games. It would either be in (user)\My Documents\My Games\Crysis, or it would be in Steam\Steamapps\common.</p>
<p>Do a search for “SaveGames” and check the path of the search results.</p>
