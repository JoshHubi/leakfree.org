    <title>[FIX] Certain Preferences Not Being Saved</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fix-certain-preferences-not-being-saved/10832</link>
    <description>To my knowledge these are the only three that don&#39;t save.
Just put the ones you want turned off/changed at the end of your autoexec.cfg file.

[code]sk_allow_autoaim &quot;0&quot; //Autoaim Off
sv_train_stop_owner_falloff &quot;0&quot; //Train Failsafe Off
rollangle &quot;1.5&quot; //View Roll. Min is &quot;0&quot;, max is &quot;3.5&quot;. [B]Edit: See Below[/B]
[/code]

Hope that helps.

[b]Edit:[/b] Upon further investigation, it appears that rollangle will reset to 3.5 even after setting it in the autoexec.cfg file. But, if you open options on game start and click apply, it will automatically set it to the value you set in the config file.
The only method I have found [i](that works for me)[/i] is to keep it in your cfg file and force-start the game with the console enabled by using the launch option &quot;-console&quot;.
However, this will start the game with the console open. If you don&#39;t want the console to open when you start the game, just put &quot;hideconsole&quot; anywhere in your autoexec.cfg file.

[b]Edit 2:[/b] If you are having problems, Jenova19 posted a solution that worked for him by setting autoexec.cfg to read only. This method didn&#39;t work for me with viewroll but you are welcome to try it.</description>

<p>Hmm, that’s really strange.</p>
<p>I just tested the method I posted as an “EDIT:” and it definitely works (with autoexec set to Read-Only)…</p>
<p>Have you tried it, yet?</p>

<p>I’m not having that problem. I don’t see why it wouldn’t set them. If you enter them in the console at the main menu it will change them as well.</p>
<p>The variables are set to “0” and are at the bottom of your autoexec.cfg file?</p>
