    <title>The mystery of the model &quot;props_am\checkpointdesk.mdl&quot; - erased from existence?</title>

So, in my map there is a desk using model [b]&quot;props_am\checkpointdesk.mdl&quot;[/b].

If anyone&#39;s wondering, it&#39;s the desk with blue battry on it, bottom right. This picture is from the old version of the map, taken circa late 2015.

I was shocked to find that Hammer was unable to find this model this morning.

At first, I assumed they (developers) changed the model name. Sadly, I looked around the model viewer for quite a long time, primarily props_am folder. Alas, no trace of model could be found in the model viewer.

It&#39;s not like I changed the model name recently either; [b]my old VMF file from April 3rd 2016 still point toward this model[/b]. This VMF is from before the Surface Tension update. (pic below)

The bms_models_dir.vpk also do not contain said model. (pic below)

The recent Surface Tension patch notes do not mention the removal of this model. I had assumed the model was removed from the game without mention. I mean, such things happen. However, things got more interesting when I decided to roll back to old version of Black Mesa (and get the model file out).

This models VPK file is one from 2015, pre-December Update (CU2, if I remember correctly). [b]Surprisingly, there still is no trace of this model.[/b] What&#39;s going on?

I am quite baffled. How is it possible the model is not in 2015 version of the game, if I indeed had played the game and could see the model well back then?

I&#39;m not computer expert - I&#39;m just a humble mathematician. If anyone can shed a light on this problem, please help me solve this mystery. Computers are weird. Maybe I&#39;m missing something. Maybe answer is very childish-ly easy. But I really do not get what might be the problem.

[b]P.S.[/b] Yeah, I could just use another model for the desk. But the mystery&#39;s been holding me off from the work. Beside, as a level designer you know how much it is painful to change structure of the room after it&#39;s been settled down.</description>

<p>Do you know if it appeared anywhere in a canon map, and/or do you have a better picture of it? I get the feeling I’ve seen this prop before, but have nothing concrete.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I had that feeling too, unfortunately, the props you see in AM are different from what I’m looking for. You can see that the model I use is straight I shaped. There isn’t such desk used in AM. The model name “checkpointdesk.mdl” extremely implies it’s used in a checkpoint room of some sort, but the checkpoint room use brush based desk. I were able to find the model and the texture for this desk, however. So that’s good.</p>

<p>The plot thickens…</p>
<p>I looked in my backup of the v0.2.1 files, and the prop <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> there.</p>
<p>Maybe Steam didn’t download the files properly when you rolled back to the cu2 update. Have you tried verifying the game cache?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So I re-downloaded the file again… and you are right. It really was in the models VPK this time! I’m not sure what happened when I rolled back the first time. Maybe I really should have checked it twice.</p>
<p>The mystery still remain, however. Because like I said, this model did not disappear for Surface Tension update. It disappeared the morning I posted this article. I don’t remember any updates that day.</p>
<p>Ah, who cares. I got the model back and that’s whats important. Thanks man!</p>
