    <title>Config file not working? Setting max fps.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/config-file-not-working-setting-max-fps/10176</link>
    <description>Hi. I got a problem with my pc: it needs a limited amount of frames per second to work with. 300 fps make my pc crash with BSOD. In some other games i solved this by enabling vsync or setting a fps max. The problem is : config file modification did nothing for me and when i try to set max fps ingame it says: cant set fps_max when connected.

I dont want to play with vsync on: it has a negative effect on mouse movement and aim.

How do i set fps max?</description>
