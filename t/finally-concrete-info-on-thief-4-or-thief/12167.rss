            <p>I’m talking about compared to other modern games though, and i said “aside from” if i were to compare to the previous games - as in I’m not comparing it because it’s pretty obvious it falls short to the previous titles in pretty much every respect except graphical fidelity.</p>

<p>if I were to compare it directly to the previous three thief games, I haven’t really seen anything that’s <span class="bbcode-i">bad</span> about it, except maybe the plot (which is a big disappointment for <span class="bbcode-i">me</span>, but not other people)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The movement is extremely limited with things like jumping, leaning, and rope arrows being contextual and I’ve seen places where a jump script was not implemented so I couldn’t cross a 5 foot gap. Besides the hub (and even in the hub to an extent) the levels are pretty linear. The decent idea of giving you body awareness doesn’t work in practice very well and just feels clunky. The AI is iffy. The sound system is worse than Thief 1 and 2. This is all gameplay related.</p>

            <p>I actually kind of enjoyed Duke Nukem Forever in some parts coming back to it after my intense hatred for it died down.</p>
<p>Though most of what I liked were the 1 or 2 decent levels in the sea of shit.</p>
<p>This game seems not as polished and more flawed than other releases, but aside from if I were to compare it directly to the previous three thief games, I haven’t really seen anything that’s <span class="bbcode-i">bad</span> about it, except maybe the plot (which is a big disappointment for <span class="bbcode-i">me</span>, but not other people)</p>

            <p>You have to draw a line somewhere. If there were people saying that they liked that ET game for the Atari or Big Rigs Over the Road Racing, would you be so quick to say that their tastes are just “different”? I’m not saying that Thiaf is as bad as those games because I know at least BROtRR was legitimately broken but I think it’s the same idea. Video games cannot be rated objectively in general I feel. Unless a game is completely broken you’re going to be able to use that excuse of “well they just like different things” to excuse whatever faults the game has. Similarly, while Thiaf is not a broken game I wouldn’t say (though it is pretty buggy and can sometimes feel unfinished) it does have legitimate problems that people besides me recognize, and generally these faults are found in many modern AAA games. I don’t think waving legitimate issues away with “well it’s just different, not bad” solves much of anything or is a good thing to do.</p>

            <p>Please, understand. He’s just trying to say that, as a Thief game, it completely fails to capture the elements of the original games that made them great, and it also sort of fails on its own as a game about being a thief because of below average mechanics.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean people can’t have fun with the game as it is.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure there were some people who had tons of fun playing Daikatana or Duke Nukem Forever…</p>

            <p>Not really. The game is just poorly made. I don’t like the accusations that because I don’t like a mediocre game that fails to be anything more than another linear cinematic experience type game that it’s my fault and not the devs’. I admitted that I’m having more fun than I expected but the game is poorly made in more ways than one and even not comparing it to the other Thief games it just isn’t anything more than average, at the very best. Comparing it to the series it’s harping on, it fails to even live up to the game that everyone considered the downfall of the series in the first place.</p>

<p>So it kinda has Deus Ex: Invisible War syndrome? Decent game but horrible sequel?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s a much worse game than Invisible War. Invisible War had tons of issues, but there was a core of a fun game beneath it all that made it still worth playing. Thief doesn’t have that at all. Even the stealth systems are sub-par, and I figured they would at least get that one thing right. There are moments of fun interspersed throughout, even a few sections I would venture to call “good,” but we’re talking about a 25-30 game if you bother to do the sidequests, and I probably enjoyed 2-3 hours of it all told. It’s that bad. If the city hub weren’t so poorly laid out and tedious to navigate and if the stealth worked better (instead of just being a crapshoot. Will they see me? I don’t know! I can’t tell!) then I could probably recommend it with some caveats, like the frustrating, pointless contextual movement system or the awful writing and voice acting.</p>
<p>But as it stands, I can safely say “Steam sale only.”</p>

            <p>Well I now officially hate this game. Or EM in that respect. Once again the end users are little less than paying beta testers. After a lost night of trying to get the game to work without considerable stuttering, I gave up, not even being able to get past the Tutorial. It doesn’t even run perceptively on the lowest ass settings. Loading a game leads to utter game crash. Who on earth decided there would be no demos before release anymore?</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’ve actually heard really good things about this game’s options menu, which isn’t something you can often say.</p>

            <p>Besides a linear level design and the missing influence of different floors (carpet, stone, metal) you can always fix your thief experience with the custom options (turning off focus, hud, etc. Completely).</p>

            <p>The game has a lot of issues and I’d say it deserves the scores it’s getting but it is possible to play it stealthily and considering there aren’t very many stealth games coming out these days it’s kind of fun. I can’t get over how poorly they did the sound though. I can’t count how many times I’ve heard a guard have the same sound clip played from his mouth twice at the same time. And I entirely turned off the music because it doesn’t fit the game.</p>
<p>It’s a really good looking game though and the cutscenes look cool at 60 fps.</p>
<p>I’d say it’s the same thing as what happened with Hitman Absolution but I think Absolution retained more of the feel of its original games than Thiaf does.</p>

            <p>I’ve read reviews and watched Let’s Plays and I still think it’s pretty bad.</p>

            <p>So many people were expecting it to be so bad that they simply think it’s true. A lot of people, I would imagine, aren’t even bothering to check the reviews.</p>
