    <title>Team Fortress 2 Drastic FPS loss</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/team-fortress-2-drastic-fps-loss/4840</link>
    <description>About a week ago, I was playing Team Fortress 2 at an average of 25-30 FPS smooth across the board. Today I noticed a 10 FPS hit with settings being high, to even being low. No gain, just loss all over. Now I&#39;m running it after a few tweaks and it&#39;s even lower now, down to 15 with no action on the screen to 5 or so with battle going on. I have no idea what&#39;s going on with it. Curious as to thoughts to what else could be hindering my performance.</description>

            <p>I’ll take temps later.</p>
<p>I have a 10" exterior house fan blowing directly into the PC [removed the side panel].</p>
<p>I have orange box, of which FPS hasn’t been tested since my problem. [iFail]</p>
<p>And the fans and heat sinks are clean as a whistle. The exterior fan keeps the dust off pretty well.</p>

            <p>It might also be useful if everyone knew your CPU temperature. My advice is to download this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.piriform.com/speccy" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.piriform.com/speccy</a></p>
<p>The program, Speccy, shows both the detailed specs for your hardware and the temperatures for them as well. Have the program running when playing a video game, then alt-tab and tell us the temperatures.</p>
<p>If worst comes to worst, you might want to buy a fan or some thermal paste for your heatsinks. They don’t cost much, so don’t worry.</p>
<p>Also, do you have any other games to test your FPS on?</p>
<p>Edit: Ah, right, you should also clean the built-in fans for your GPU and CPU. That should also help with temperatures and performance, hopefully.</p>

            <p>So here it is.</p>
<p>CPU: AMD Something [Single Core] 2.08GHz [Don’t know temps]<br>
GPU: nVidia GeForce 6200 256mb [OCed to core:444 - memory:443 underload 60c]<br>
Memory: 2Gbs DDR [unsure of frequency or timings]</p>
<p>I’m running a Compaq S6300NX with an extra gig of ram in it with the 6200. Everything else is stock and the PSU was replaced with a 850w when I tried to use an ATI card.</p>
<p>Edit: No anti-virus running besides standard built in for windows.</p>

            <p>I’ve found my TF2 performance drop from a playable fps, probably ~30, when I first played it many moons ago, to now barely scraping 4 fps. I think temperatures may be responsible…</p>
<p>What’re your specs and temps? Give us the usual.</p>

            <p>I doubt this is related but I’ll say it anyway. Videocards have a 2D and 3D mode, when the GPU is idle it switches to the 2D mode (like when you’re internetting) it will automatically lower voltages and clockfrequencies to save power etc. Sometimes when you alt-tab out of your game the graphics card switches to 2D mode but it doesn’t go back to 3D when you go back into the game resulting in a massive drop in FPS. If this happens try installing a newer or older driver (had it happening several times in certain games on a GTX285).</p>

            <p>My FPS has been getting worse in TF2 each update as they pack more crap into the game. I used to be able to get a stable 100+, now it jumps between 20 and 80 all the time.</p>
