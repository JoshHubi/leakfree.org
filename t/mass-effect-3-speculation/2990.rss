    <title>Mass Effect 3 - Speculation</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mass-effect-3-speculation/2990</link>
    <description>[COLOR=&#39;Cyan&#39;]Caution, this thread will contain ME2 spoilers.

Typically what draws me to most games is their visuals, and their plot lines, and the Mass Effect franchise is doing very well in both areas. In my opinion, one of the best things about this game is the manner in which Bioware reveals interesting information, while simultaneously raising new questions that i really want answers to. 

By way of example:
1. It&#39;s been awhile, but i believe in ME1 the Prothean computer said that it did not know what became of the scientists that went to the Citadel. I want  to know what happened to them.
2. If you allowed the Rachni queen to live in ME1, you get a message from her in ME2, but you are not told where to find her, and there are no missions that i know of involving them, but it is implied that you will see them again.
3. In ME2, you can meet up with Liara T&#39;soni, but she&#39;s too busy chasing after the shadow broker to join your crew. Will you be able to help her, and recruit her in ME3?

There are many more avenues i would like to explore. Bioware has set the groundwork for a ridiculous amount of possible plot elements in the next installment of Mass Effect, and I&#39;m excited to see how they pull it all together.

Here&#39;s my personal speculation on what will happen in ME3. In my playthroughs, i felt that alot of emphasis was put on the fleets of the various civilizations you encounter, such as the Quarian fleet, and the Geth, and, of course, the Alliance/Council fleet. Also, if you saved the Rachni queen in ME1, the message you get from her in ME2 implies that the Rachni will help you some way against the Reapers later.

That, along with the final scene of ME2 showing alot of Reaper ships seemingly on the move, leads me to believe that Bioware is gearing up for some sort of massively epic ship battle, which would be a fitting climax to the story. If that is the case, then many of the missions will probably involve finding ways to convince civilizations/governments that the reaper threat is real, and that they should focus their efforts against them. For example, the council, who don&#39;t want to believe in the Reapers at all, or the Quarians, who want to go to war against the Geth. 

There are many many other small details that i&#39;m curious about, but i&#39;ve written enough for now.

[i]For the purpose of discussion, what direction do you think Mass Effect 3 will take, and what would you like to see?[/i]</description>

            <p>I want to crouch whenever I damn feel like it, because it’s supposed to reduce recoil upon firing, and lowering my profile on the enemy, also increasing stealth.</p>

            <p>@ Savant: Mapping everything to the space bar works great.  You never need to use any of those commands at the same time anyway.  You can’t run while you’re up against cover and you can’t run through cover.  The natural progression is that when you run into cover, you take cover.</p>
<p>The space bar mapping works great.  Why would you want a bunch of random keys for things that can more easily be done with one?</p>
<p>Also in case you missed it (concerning the Protheans) SPOILER - kind of, this is the ME3 thread after all:<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]The Collectors are the Protheans (ME2).  Also the Protheans got most of their advanced technology from the Reapers (just like current civilizations have.  (ME1)</p>

            <p>Yeah, I remember finding something on my second playthrough (with my first char from ME1)… something about an interest in Dark Matter.  It was before you get introduced to Haestrom’s sun’s problem.  Like… really early.  Don’t remember if it was the codex or the woman from Noveria…</p>

<p>I think there was some reference in the codex to that. I don’t have time to check right now, but if you look up Reapers, i believe it says something about some civilizations believing they consume stars. I could be wrong though.</p>

<p>Yeah, but put your fingers on WASD and look at your keyboard. Besides WASD, only about 6 are comfortable to use while resting on WASD. In any case, it always felt good to me.</p>

            <p>I’d say that, because I recall that somebody said “it’s more likely that the Shadow Broker refers to a group of sorts” and I also remember hearing somewhere (I think it was in the encyclopedia in the game) “There is speculation that the Illusive Man is a council rather than a single person.”</p>
<p>We (the player) know that is false, and that the Illusive Man is in fact one man, so maybe the rumor that the Shadow Council is a group is also missplanted speculation by the Illusive Man.</p>
<p>Then again, why would the Illusive Man ever sell secrets to aliens, he’s all gung-ho-human-kind.</p>

            <p>I expect ME3 to end the trilogy the way it should. ME1 and ME2 had great storylines no doubt about it. Most of all i like interaction options bettwen characters. Mentioned before, if you let legion lose or grunt, keeping the collector base or not, reprogramming the heretics and all the other stuff will eventually pay of in ME3 i think. I hope to see some new media or details about it soon.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yeah, the changes from ME1 to ME2 were really minor.  An e-mail here, a new NPC there to talk to, maybe a small five minute “quest” that added/subtracted nothing new, etc. etc…</p>
<p>But with Mass Effect 2…  the mass amounts of ways you could end the game, keep/destroy Collector base, activate Legion or don’t, open Grunt’s pod, or leave it closed…  (Never left grunt’s pod closed, so I don’t know if it is forced upon you eventually, nor did I ever leave Legion deactivated, so I don’t know if THAT is forced upon you eventually either).</p>
<p>And the choices from ME1 to ME3 (specifically love and who you saved [cuz if you were male, and chose not to save whatsherface even though you were in love, that’d be yet ANOTHER way for it to go through.])…  had a lover, let them die, had a lover, let them live, have a lover (Asari), so she never died, had no lover, saved Kaiden, had no lover, Saved Ashley…  Those alone are going to be major changes.  Cuz I assume the person you saved is going to play a larger part in ME3, but even if it’s not big, all those possibilities equals a lot of line recording, regardless.</p>

            <p>I really wonder what the difference will be in ME3 if you save the Collector base as opposed to blow it up. The other decisions have all seemed relatively minor compared to that one. And now, with all the possible variances from ME1 and ME2 in the way they can be played, it seems like Bioware is setting themselves up for a massive project in ME3. However, maybe that’s not really true. After all, in the end, while importing your choices from ME1 make you <span class="bbcode-i">feel</span> like you’re in the universe you shaped in ME2, game-wise not that much actually needed to be changed to do that. For example: The council doesn’t believe you about the Reapers either way. Just change a few lines, add a little scene of talking to the Council if you saved them and bam you’re done. Maybe Bioware will find a similar way to minimize the work of displaying the outcomes of the Collector base decision as well.</p>

<p>I hope the illusive man gets what’s coming to him too, but i’m not so sure he deserves to get killed or beat down or anything. Certainly he’s got an ego, and can be somewhat dishonest, but his decision to bring back Shepard, and support him on his missions is exactly what had to be done, as nobody else seems to be capable of accomplishing what Shepard can. Of course, that’s the way Bioware designed the game, but, personally, i’m going to withhold judgement on “TIM” until they reveal more information.</p>
<p>Either way, i hope that potential conflicts with the Illusive Man don’t overshadow the fight with the reapers. And no more giant terminators please.</p>

            <p>I don’t want vorcha.  They’re basically bepedal semi-sentient creatures with only the most basic of instinct.  I don’t want Batarians cuz I hate them.  I’m racist against Batarians.  All the other Aliens, I love them.  And I don’t mind the Volus, but I HATE the Batarians and vorcha.</p>

<p>I hope we get to see Turian homeworld. And the Salarian’s, although I get the idea that given the pristine…ness of their world (as stated by the Administrator of Noveria in ME1), they don’t let visitors on-world that often. But for Shepard, I should think they’d make an exception.</p>
<p>Considering that Turian space borders ours (humanity’s) space, I wonder why we HAVEN’T had any interaction with their world in the games.</p>

<p>That is a good point. I was a little surprised that i couldn’t visit earth either. If you helped that Samesh Batia (i think that was his name) guy get his wife’s body back in ME1, you’ll get a message from him saying he started a restaraunt on Earth. I wanted to visit it dammit lol.</p>
<p>It’s possible they may add some of these places as DLC for ME2 though, like the normandy crash site.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking of an interesting way (imo) to convince the council to help against the reapers. Say you find irrefutable evidence for the council of the extent and severity of the reaper threat. You could now have two choices. The paragon choice could be to give the information directly to the council, and letting them deal with it. The renegade choice could be giving the information to the media, who will spread it around to everyone, likely inciting panic, but preventing the politicians from hiding it from the public. Either way, the council/alliance won’t have any choice but to act. I’m not sure what the neutral choice could be though.</p>
<p>On another note, i wonder what the deal is with Reapers and insects? I mean you’ve got the Keepers, which are very insect like, the Protheans were modified to be insect like creatures, and then the Rachni queen’s message says she thinks the reapers were behind the Rachni Wars.</p>
