    <description>I was encountering an issue with fullbright being active in my game, and I found a solution here on the forums by entering &quot;mat_hdr_level 2&quot; and &quot;mat_fullbright 0&quot;, which did fix my problem. But immediately after fixing the lighting, my game crashes. I&#39;m stumped.</description>

<p>I bet bkdale86 or one of the other developers will know the fix but in the meantime please post your system specs and what mods you have installed.<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>I have no mods installed, but I’m running on a Windows 10  laptop with an Intel i3 2350 and 6GB of ram. I’m also running basic Intel HD Graphics 3000.</p>

<p>If you are running the game on a laptop with a dedicated GPU and switchable graphics, make sure the game is running on the dedicated GPU (type [tt]mat_info[/tt] in the console to see which GPU the game is running on).</p>
<p>Otherwise, try disabling CSM (Cascade Shadow Map) by setting “Shadow Detail” to medium. Or type [tt]cl_csm_enable 0[/tt] and [tt]cl_depth_enabled 0[/tt] in the console.</p>

</aside>
<p>For the GPU, I explained above. I had managed to get a save with fullbright the last time I played, so I checked and saw that the shadow detail is already medium, and the commands already had the value of 0. I’m assuming this means that CSM is off, however whenever I boot up this non-fullbright save, after 5 seconds it crashes, without fail.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit: </span>I just started a new game and everything is working perfectly now. Idk what changed exactly or what the exact fix was, but it’s working fine.</p>
