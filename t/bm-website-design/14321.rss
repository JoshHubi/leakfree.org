    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m just wondering, how did you (the devs) make the current BM website? The design is really nice, smooth animations and parallax scrolling put a wonderful bow on top. I&#39;m looking around for a template for my own use, but I can&#39;t find any web design services that provide that nice of a design, and my last resort is of course just coding the site myself... but I&#39;d rather not. Was it a service or did you folks make it yourself?

And to anyone else in the community, if you have your own website, what service did you use and why?

Thanks!</description>
