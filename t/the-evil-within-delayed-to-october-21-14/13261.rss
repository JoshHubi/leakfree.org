            <p>It’s an ok game. Don’t go out of your way to spend full price on it. Borrow it if you can or get it on sale or pre-owned or whatever.</p>
<p>I think the only current gen game that’s been released on console that I would recommend to anyone and everyone is The Last of Us, and that was just a remake x’D I hope they start releasing some really great games on this gen, cause right now they’re ok games but still run of the mill like most games recently have been.</p>

            <p>Going by that final trailer the games looks like a mix of the action sequences from Resident Evil and the stealth of The Last of Us.</p>
<p>It looks decent but nothing groundbreaking.</p>

            <p>To be quiet frank I never thought it was going to be the second coming of survival horror.  Action and horror to me, don’t work together.  Every time you give me tools to fight back in a game, I win because I am better than the joe who the game is balanced around.  So the action scenes so far lack tension at times and just aren’t conducive to horror. The prolog was great and made me think the game would go back and forth between defenseless horror ala amnesia and tense action like RE4 but its been much more of the latter.  Except its 10 years later and I am much better at video games.  I haven’t yet finished it and am currently hoping for another or maybe two sequences without weapons but I doubt it.  The action and stealth system is competent but the story is too dream like to feel of consequence it takes away from the sense of tension.</p>
<p>Its a good genre game so far, but don’t expect it to invoke strong feelings of terror or fear.  Just be sometimes tense, sometimes unsettling or creepy.</p>

            <p>I haven’t really payed much attention to this after I saw the trailer. Something about mutant stuff like you see in silent hill/killing floor/(outlast?)/(Resident Evil?) and the like, I’ve never found interesting or that scary. Now, I’ve never played any such games due to my aforementioned disinterest. Are they actually scary? Or is it something that kinda has to give you the creeps first?</p>

            <p>The concept of the game looks cool, some of the people involved are good signs, though there’s a lot of games coming out this holiday so I don’t know if I’ll get it.</p>

<p>The Evil Within to be played at 30fps and to utilize an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 for all platforms,”</p>

<p>This is honestly a retarded idea.</p>

            <p>Can’t say I’m happy about that decision but at least I hope the workarounds don’t break the game. Still, I won’t mind too much playing it at the default framerate if that’s how it has to be.</p>

            <p>It’s also locked at whatever crazy aspect ratio they’re using. There’s apparently going to be console/ini commands to remove the aspect ratio and framerate lock but the fact that they’re there at all is retarded. And we don’t know if anything will screw up if they’re removed.</p>

            <p>Monolith is not exactly unfamiliar with PC development. All their games have always been quite well optimized, so if they say that 6GB are necessary for these ultra quality textures, there must be a good reason for that.</p>
<p>At some point, requirements like those must become commonplace. I mean, I remember when I thought that 2GB of RAM was kinda overkill for games and now 8GB is the standard.</p>
