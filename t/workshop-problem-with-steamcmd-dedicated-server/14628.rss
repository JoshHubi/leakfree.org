    <title>Workshop problem with SteamCMD (Dedicated Server)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/workshop-problem-with-steamcmd-dedicated-server/14628</link>
    <description>Hi!
I encountered a problem with SteamCMD and it&#39;s [b]workshop_download_item[/b] feature.
I get this error when I&#39;m trying to download a Workshop item for Black Mesa:

[tt]Update workshop job for app 362890 canceled: Failed to request decryption key for depot 362890 (Access Denied) (Missing decryption key)[/tt]

I think that this happens because Black Mesa Dedicated Server is on Steam as another product and not as a tool for Black Mesa.   :wink:  
The only way to use Workshop addons is to install them manually.</description>
