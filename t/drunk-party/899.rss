    <title>Drunk Party</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/drunk-party/899</link>
    <description>I was just at a friend&#39;s party last night where everybody but me and my brother got completely dunk.

One guy stood on a quad and tried to do a back flip off of it, he made a full flip and then kept going so he landed flat on his back. He also got on a dirt bike and started it up but my other drunk friend tackled him and pulled him away in an arm lock before he could hit the gas. He put on my friend&#39;s sister&#39;s girly tanktop too. He was walking around drunk acting tough and acting like a wannabe gangster while wearing a really girly tanktop.  :smiley: 

Another friend drunk dialed a girl I really like because he is going out with her sister and wanted to talk with her. It was midnight so he got the voicemail but he was so drunk he thought it was still ringing. We talked to my friend for about 2 minutes telling him how drunk he was before realising that the entire conversation was being left on the girl&#39;s voicemail. I don&#39;t know if I should be cracking up or really pissed off.

My brother brought a camera and was filming most of it, he got this of him slapping my drunk friend, but he wasn&#39;t filming when the guy did the flip. &gt; :frowning:

<p>I think most anime porn is about rape fantasies (at least from what I have seen myself and been told by others who have seen more) - which is really sick and disgusting to me. But there are some anime series’ that are quite funny and a bit erotic at the same time, like “Manga Love Story”. It’s a shame, though, that this series is intended as sexual education for grown-ups and shows so many things solely based on male sex fantasies, without taking female needs into consideration at all. Only what man wishes for women to be their needs. Still fun to watch, though.<br>
However, it grants a glimpse at a huge problem with sexuality that’s obviously part of the Japanese culture.</p>

            <p>shit man, cool it. sorry for offending you. If I thought that I was sounding high and mighty I would have shut the fuck up.

I was stating my opinion. here, have my horse.<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
