    <title>Ask an Indian!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ask-an-indian/7750</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been really inactive for a year or two now, not really posting anywhere except for the DA thread. So I just thought i should do something that would add to the community experience, do my bit, you know. 

So here I am, I&#39;m an Indian citizen (not the native american red indian btw) :wink:  and I&#39;m ready to answer your questions and clear any doubts you may have on India and its culture, history etc. 

I&#39;m doing this because lately there has been an Indian influence on international(especially American) pop culture and most of it gives people the wrong idea about India and it&#39;s people. 

One more thing, I&#39;m currently undergoing a bachelor&#39;s degree in engineering so i&#39;m busy(like everyone) and i have limited access to the web every day, so please cut me some slack when it comes to the speed with which i answer questions. Keeping these factors in mind, i will do my best to post at least once a day.

So anyway, lets get on with this. I hope everyone can keep it civil, because we are all very civilised people here.  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>The accents you posted are very bad or at the very best very stereotypical. I have regular contact with people in India because of the work I do, and the accents vary a lot, even within regions. I mostly talk to people from Delhi, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh or Tamil Nadu… not that I am able to instantly recognize from what region my converstational partner comes though, far from it.</p>
<p>A new question: Is it just me, or are Indian people very impatient on the phone? Or just very anxious when dealing with serious situations or if they need help?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m glad you understood how bad the accents i posted were, which was the point. And it’s nice to know that your work has you talking to real Indian people. So as you may have noticed, a real Indian speaks very differently from what is usually shown and even then it differs form region to region as you said.</p>
<p>And well, I really can’t answer your new question since I am an Indian myself and won’t be able to look at our phone talking ways from an outsider’s perspective. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Although I guess you are right in some way, I can’t say much since the behavior would be almost imperceptible to me since everyone including me would talk like that. Get it?</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">@ Asharil-</span> Good question, that’s one thing I’ve been waiting for someone to ask. The thing is that all Indians portrayed in American sitcoms and movies are South Indians and they all have the same dam unrealistically stupid accent. You must have seen many people on Youtube mimic the way an ‘Indian’ speaks for example&gt;&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWVIObGHxzs" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWVIObGHxzs</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmcThFmdEk&amp;feature=related" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rmcThFmdEk&amp;feature=related</a></p>
<p>The girl’s accent is so bad that she sounds more like a Russian than anything.</p>
<p>Both these accents are nothing like the way ANY Indian would speak, ever, even by mistake. So it really pisses me off to see those stereotypical Indians in those shows and films.</p>
<p>Secondly, quite a few North, East, West Indians are a whole lot different looking than the typical South Indian. I mean, they’re a lot fairer; not a much as white people, but there’s still a noticeable difference. So all those ‘brown skin’ jokes that guy Russel Peters makes are not really applicable to all of us.</p>
<p>Sadly, most of the world doesn’t know what the real general Indian looks or talks like and it never will. Now about ‘The Big Bang Theory’, I have only seen a few minutes of some random episode where I saw that Indian guy a few times and well, it’s just sad.</p>
<p>Ok, so about the video game industry. There really isn’t some big industry of our own or anything out here, all games launched internationally are launched here too and those are what we play. And about Indians being represented in games, it really isn’t that big a deal and I’ve never thought about it so can’t say much right now.<br>
There is one Indian made game that I know about though&gt; <a href="https://mtvdesi.com/2010/10/26/indian-video-game-el-shaddai-pwns-other-newcomers/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://mtvdesi.com/2010/10/26/indian-video-game-el-shaddai-pwns-other-newcomers/</a><br>
Check it out, I can’t tell you much about it since I haven’t played it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><a class="mention" href="/u/shadi">@Shadi</a>-</span> oh, got it.</p>

            <p>Damn, you are a person from India. Not a native American.</p>
<p>And here I was looking to just post “How?” as a clever play on the stereotypical greeting and posting it in the form of a question.</p>
<p>Ah well.</p>
<p>Something serious then:</p>
<p>How do you feel about the portrayal of Indian people/culture in Western media (e.g.Raj Koothrappali in the Big Bang Theory)?<br>
Do you think the Indian culture is rather underrepresented in the video-game industry?<br>
-And-<br>
Does India have its own video game industry and would you be able to provide example of games?</p>

<p>What is your opinion of Jawaharlal Nehru? Did you learn of him in school, is he held in good regard?</p>

<p>Firstly, I’m sorry for not answering for so long, i’ve just been really unwell this past week.</p>
<p>Anyway, Jawaharlal Nehru was instrumental in helping India gain its freedom and he was the first Indian Prime Minister, so yeah, he’s pretty much respected all over. Nobody’s really had anything against him in India. And yes, we learnt about him in school.</p>

<p>What kind of meat Indian can’t eat?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, India has many religions and each of them have their own teachings on what can and cannot be eaten. To elaborate, Hindus are not supposed to eat meat at all actually and the cow is sacred to them, Muslims can eat any meat except for pork(if i’m wrong please correct me Shadi), Parsis can also eat any kind of meat(once again I’m not 100% sure), but the Jains(those who follow Jainism) are not allowed to eat any kind of meat or even animal products like milk and eggs.</p>

<p>Hey, I’m glad I could help.<br>
I think you may have misunderstood one thing. The difference between an urban and rural place is not that people won’t be able to communicate, it’s just that the rural people won’t be that fluent in English compared to their urban counterparts. Actually the vast majority of them won’t know more than a few words, and for the older generations one can’t even say that much.<br>
So the point is that within the same state, since everyone speaks the same language, the rural and urban people can easily communicate with each other.</p>
<p>And about our ancestry. It’s a mixture of the Aryans, Dravidians and a lot of others like the Mughals. So the differences are unavoidable.</p>
