            <p>Beyond Good and Evil 2.<br>
Beyond Good and Evil HD.<br>
Portal 2.<br>
Duke Nukem Forever.<br>
Deus Ex Human Revolution.<br>
Black Mesa.<br>
Half-Life Episode 3. ( Fingers crossed )</p>
<p>I’m keeping an eye on…</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat.<br>
Brink.<br>
Rage.</p>
<p>These are the only ones I can think of that aren’t a guarantee.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m keeping my wish list extremely small this year.<br>
I bought shit tons of games last year and I only ever think to myself “This was worth it” for about 1 in 20.</p>
<p>So I’m keeping it much shorter and full of games that could only fail if development suddenly changed hands to an Evangelical choir.</p>
<p>I’ve either got to much shit to do or to much shit I’m supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>Dota2 was actually already announced. Icefrog said before the statement of Gabe, that there will be an announcement, about his project.So, no surprise actually.</p>

</aside>
<p>Him saying there’s going to be an announcement is a hell of a lot different from “Valve is making DoTa 2.” The surprises should not be measured in how surprising they actually are, but in how big of an announcement they are.</p>

<p>Nope. The item shop for Team Fortress 2 was the first of the 3 big surprises. It was a “surprise” - no one expected it.</p>
<p>Portal 2 for PS3 was before Gabe even made this statement, about the surprises. 2 are still left. Dota2 isn’t also part of the 3 surprises, cause the name was already registered, so it wasn’t a surprise in anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>DoTa 2 was definitely one of the surprises. It just got leaked. Doesn’t mean it wasn’t one of the surprises. You’re defining Valve’s surprises as anything that surprises you. That’s not how it works.</p>

<p>Left? I thought DoTa and Portal 2 coming to the ps3 were our surprises so far.</p>

            <p>I think there’s going to be lot of exciting stuff this year. It’ll make up for a lot of the shit we got late '10. I’m hoping, but not at all strongly, that the next CoD will actually live up to it’s reputation. And I’m hoping, very tentatively, that we’ll have blackmesa some mid this year or at the very least late this year.</p>
<p>Deadspace 2 looks pretty exciting. AC Brotherhood looks like it’ll be amazing, just like AC2. It’ll be fun to see DNF FINALLY released, regardless of whether or not it actually turns out to be a good game. DoTa 2 is a pretty unique genre I’ve never tried before and it’s made by Valve so it’ll have to to be good. And then Portal 2, which I’ll have tons of fun with. And if I’m not mistaken, Valve still has one surprise left for us, which I"m hoping to be something EP3 related.</p>

            <p>Hell of pissing shit mothers. Well, at least it’s being worked on. I still live in mortal fear of the morning I wake up to find that it’s been cancelled. Again.</p>

<p>Aliens: Colonial Marines- I have been waiting for this game for-fucking-ever. I really hope they do it justice.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m also really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it’s still a long ways off. I picked up this months EGM because there was an interview with Randy Pitchford, and in it he said that Sega jumped the gun and announced the game before a single line of code had been written, so it’s actually probably not coming until 2012.</p>
