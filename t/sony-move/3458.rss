    <description>Just though I&#39;d make a general thread about the most ridiculous looking piece of tech to come out in a while. Post your thoughts about why it will or why it won&#39;t fail, its usefulness to gaming, and how much of an idiot the guy that said it was better than a keyboard and mouse was.
Personally I think it will work for some things but shooters will remain best controlled with a controller.</description>

<p>Respectfully, I disagree. The PS3 is hardly superior to the Wii in every way; the Wii actually tried to innovate with the new generation of consoles, the PS3 dropped its “boomerang” controller design in favour of <span class="bbcode-i">exactly the same controller</span> they had for the last generation of consoles, except for the six axis ‘motion’ controller which does <span class="bbcode-i">absolutely nothing</span>, and was nothing but a last minute attempt to copy the motion controlling ideas of the Wii.</p>
<p>The Wii can most definitely holds its own against the PS3, if not on a graphical/technological level, then certainly at a fun-ness level. While a lot of the Wii games are targeted towards a younger audience, that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re any less fun for others. Wii Sports has provided massive amounts of enjoyment for me, my brother, my sister and all our friends. Super Smash Brothers Brawl is awesome, Mario Kart is much more fun than GT can ever be, Trauma Centre is brilliant, and there’s a plethora of other examples for Wii games that are excellent. There’s also Homebrew, which means that my Wii forms the centre of a lot of my home theatre system.</p>
<p>Now, that’s not saying that the PS3 doesn’t have advantages. Its got some good IPs that are unique to the platform like FF (except they released the latest one for the 360 as well?), GT (except no split screen multiplayer?), MGS, Heavy Rain and LBP, to name a few. But despite the amazing graphical capabilities of the platform, the ‘battle’ between the PS3 and the Wii can’t be just ‘won’ on that level; the question comes down to enjoyability and fun, and I think you’ll find they’re equal competitors.</p>
<p>As for the Sony ‘Move’, its a blatant rip off of the Wiimote, to the extent that they’re not even trying to hide it any more. It doesn’t advance the industry any more than it just confirms that the Wii’s move was the correct one. I anticipate a wave of slightly graphically enhanced versions of Wii games.</p>

<p>God damn, not only are you a raging mac fanboy, but a nintendo fanboy as well?</p>
<p>Wii’s target casual gamers, so unless your 10 or having a party with a bunch of hot chicks, PS3/xbox360/pc&gt;wii. Casual games aside, you only have about 10 new and old decent games to choose from and the controls aren’t that great. And before you say “but u haven’t evun played a wi!!!1!!111!” My uncle has one and I have played it on a lot of different games including a few of the casual ones. The ps3 dildo wand isn’t at all appealing to me as an fps fanboy, but the system (not necessarily the controller) is a hell of a lot better than the wii. And I’m guessing they’ll release a lot of casual games for the ps3 when it comes out.</p>

<p>Secondly, I realize that was probably  a rash thing of me to say, but while the Wii was bringing a fresh perspective to videogaming, the technology is far from new. Accelerometers have been used in more ingenious ways than that. I’ll go as far as to say that Nintendo did to the Wii what Apple does with most of its products: convince users that its what they need, even if they don’t.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I definitely agree that accelerometers were hardly new. But it was mainly because of the marketing/implementation of the product that made it so successful and revolutionary; by convincing everyone that it was the new direction the market should take (as opposed to ‘staying the course’ with the conservative PS3/Xbox 360 take), they made the Wii into the revolutionary console it was. Now everyone else is playing catchup, while the Wii pats itself on the shoulder for a job well done.</p>

<p>At least it ridicules the Wii for not having 1:1 motion control like they led us to believe, and Natal for having this stupid controller-less thingie.</p>
<p>But apart from the ad, I’m sure Sony will fall flat on its face too :meh:</p>

            <p>First of all, glad you “respectfully” disagree. We could use some more respect on BMS forums.</p>
<p>Secondly, I realize that was probably  a rash thing of me to say, but while the Wii was bringing a fresh perspective to videogaming, the technology is far from new. Accelerometers have been used in more ingenious ways than that. I’ll go as far as to say that Nintendo did to the Wii what Apple does with most of its products: convince users that its what they need, even if they don’t.</p>
<p>And I’m fine with Sony having this introduced. While it deff is a rip-off, its not like all games are going to be made with this controller. Its just another option, further broadening the scope of game genres the PS3 can encompass.</p>

</aside>
<p>Respectfully, I disagree. The PS3 is hardly superior to the Wii in every way; the Wii actually tried to innovate with the new generation of consoles, the PS3 dropped its “boomerang” controller design in favour of <span class="bbcode-i">exactly the same controller</span> they had for the last generation of consoles, except for the six axis ‘motion’ controller which does <span class="bbcode-i">absolutely nothing</span>, and was nothing but a last minute attempt to copy the motion controlling ideas of the Wii.</p>
<p>The Wii can most definitely holds its own against the PS3, if not on a graphical/technological level, then certainly at a fun-ness level. While a lot of the Wii games are targeted towards a younger audience, that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re any less fun for others. Wii Sports has provided massive amounts of enjoyment for me, my brother, my sister and all our friends. Super Smash Brothers Brawl is awesome, Mario Kart is much more fun than GT can ever be, Trauma Centre is brilliant, and there’s a plethora of other examples for Wii games that are excellent. There’s also Homebrew, which means that my Wii forms the centre of a lot of my home theatre system.</p>
<p>Now, that’s not saying that the PS3 doesn’t have advantages. Its got some good IPs that are unique to the platform like FF (except they released the latest one for the 360 as well?), GT (except no split screen multiplayer?), MGS, Heavy Rain and LBP, to name a few. But despite the amazing graphical capabilities of the platform, the ‘battle’ between the PS3 and the Wii can’t be just ‘won’ on that level; the question comes down to enjoyability and fun, and I think you’ll find they’re equal competitors.</p>
<p>As for the Sony ‘Move’, its a blatant rip off of the Wiimote, to the extent that they’re not even trying to hide it any more. It doesn’t advance the industry any more than it just confirms that the Wii’s move was the correct one. I anticipate a wave of slightly graphically enhanced versions of Wii games.</p>

            <p>I think Natal is going to go farther, honestly. For the casual gamer this is aimed at, no controllers beats 2 controllers any day.</p>
<p>But as with any new tech, show me the games and then we’ll talk.</p>

<p>I was thinking within’ consoles. There really is no question that the Keyboard+Mouse will be superior, despite one of their sales people saying it is better in… wait for it… modeling, mapping and movie editing.</p>

            <p>Just though I’d make a general thread about the most ridiculous looking piece of tech to come out in a while. Post your thoughts about why it will or why it won’t fail, its usefulness to gaming, and how much of an idiot the guy that said it was better than a keyboard and mouse was.<br>
Personally I think it will work for some things but shooters will remain best controlled with a controller.</p>
