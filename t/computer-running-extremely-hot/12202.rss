    <title>Computer Running Extremely Hot</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-running-extremely-hot/12202</link>
    <description>I apologize in advance if this has been posted somewhere before, and if someone could point me in the right direction, that would be wonderful. 

Anyway, I was running Black Mesa on a Dell Inspiron N7110. My specs are:

Windows 7 64
i7 2.2GHZ Quad Core
Nvidia GeForce GT 525M

I can run almost any game on high settings and not have a problem, however when running Black Mesa, the computer gets extremely hot - I mean, I almost can&#39;t touch it. I haven&#39;t even gotten past the intro on the tram because I was afraid I would damage my components. 

Could anyone shed some light on this issue? 

Thanks again</description>

            <p>^ I don’t think any of those would fit very well on a laptop.</p>
<p>And to the OP, you should’ve bought a gaming laptop not a cute customizable laptop for girls.</p>
<p>Seriously though, it’s probably because it’s a Dell.</p>
