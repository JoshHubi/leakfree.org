    <description>Hello!!

Im new here, but been lurking about reading posts and following Black Mesa from the very start. Some of the topics here are really fun to read, really great community, so thought I should sign up  :slight_smile: 

Recently I read a post about what age you were when you played Half Life (not number 2). I was really surprised how young people were, and that was when they said it was number 2 they played. Think most were too young to have played original Half Life upon release?? :|

Now I was about 16 when I played Half Life and it blew me away with amazement. I remember comparing it to Unreal. Ever since I have never stopped playing Half Life, in fact just completed it again last weekend!

Anyway, with all that out the way, my point for posting was to ask what people thought about Half Life 2 if they were able to play Half Life 1 first?

I dont know if I am the only one on the boat here, but I really really did not like Half Life 2 at all (at first). The engine was great, graphics good, loads of action etc BUT I did not think it was anything like Half Life and was really disappointed. 

I now like the game much more now, as I think I may have been such a Half Life fanatic that I got upset when they changed the formula. My mind just didn&#39;t want to except the way number 2 took the story/action. 

It was years until I played Half Life 2 again, just to see if I would like it any more and suddenly I loved it......really strange! :meh:

However, I expect if you were the other way around and the first Half Life game you played was two, then I expect number 1 was radically different. What did you think?

I think I just loved Black Mesa so much, even though it could not be in number two as it got nuked in Opposing Force.:&#39;(

Though I do like number 2, I think my favorite is still number 1 and thats why I cant wait for Black Mesa! In a way that will be more like Half Life 2 for me. :smiley: 

Anyway, sorry for long post.....think I got carried away.

So what are your thoughts with 1 and 2 story/action/location??</description>

            <p>I played half life 2 first, and i was so fucking impressed. I then went to the first half life, but couldn’t get myself to play it, i didn’t like the graphichs. I then went back to half life about a year after, and i loved it. Weird. But well, amazing games, no doubt about that. I must say that for me, hl2 wins, because of the storyline and the different enviroments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I played HL1 when it first came out and was excited to hear about part 2 coming out so that I could see the continuing adventures of Gordon Freeman.  When I first booted up HL2 and saw the G-Man’s face filling the screen, I giggled like a little girl.  Then he said “So, wake up, Mr. Freeman.  Wake up and…smell the ashes.”  I was like D:  This is gonna be awesome!</p>
<p>Then I was introduced to the police state that is City 17 and was I was like “WTF”?  It was almost completely unrecognizable as a Half-Life game.  It was beautiful, yes.  The graphics, the sound, but I was like…what happened?  Then I met Barney and I began giggling again and started to understand that it was some time later and I was thinking “What happened?”</p>
<p>As I played the game, I became aware of what happened over the last decade or more years after I destroyed Nihilanth and accepted the G-Man’s offer.  I enjoyed the airboat sequence getting to Black Mesa East (I giggled again, loving the references to Half Life 1) and finally understood what happened when I looked at the corkboard in Eli’s lab.</p>
<p>Then I went from “WTF, this isn’t Half Life” to “OMG, this is Half Life on steroids!”  Then I wanted more.  Then through the episodes (fucking Strider battle at the end of Ep2!) and, now, dammit, I want Episode 3 and Half Life 3!</p>

            <p>Freeman’s Mind got me into Half Life in the first place, though I played HL2 first. I thought it was awesome, though it was one of the first PC games I ever played, and it challenged me. (the only other PC games I ever played were the Star Wars Jedi Knight series, The Sims 2, and Roller Coaster Tycoon 3) so this was a nice change.</p>
<p>I eventually played HL and thought it was cool, the biggest reason being I got to see stuff from FM and explore on my own. Without FM, I probably wouldn’t have liked HL AS much. I’d still think it was good and keep playing it.</p>

            <p>Personally, I like HL1 much better than HL2. Both are great, but HL1 just had this feeling of “trying to get out” which is hard to create for a game. HL2 had more a feeling of “Lets save the world” which I didn’t like nearly as much.</p>
<p>And Hl1’s weaponry was cooler because there was much more, and they packed a hell of a punch. I really hated much of HL2’s weaponry, minus the grav gun, 357, and Crossbow.</p>

            <p>I actually liked Episode One the best out of HL’s main series. The mix of gameplay and puzzle solving elements was easily at it’s best. The flashlight mechanics in Lowlife made Alyx even more indispensable, as you had to work as a team to survive. It was also quite inventive in that most of the Episode was best balanced towards playing with the Gravity Gun- getting the achievement for “The One Free Bullet” was actually surprisingly easy (And fun, unlike “Little Rocket Man”).</p>
<p>Episode Two was still amazing, but Episode One was just so much fun, and it emphasized the urban combat of the later chapters of HL2 with an intensity and urgency that kept things moving forward. On the whole, Ep1 was just an insanely well polished shooter.</p>

            <p>When i first played HL1 and the expansion packs the sounds alone were enough to scare the shit out of me.</p>
<p>For example, at the start of the blast pit chapter there’s a bullsquid attacking a headcrab that it can’t actually hit, i thought it was some alien digging through the walls.<br>
The ambient sounds you hear at some points really set the tone that not all areas in the facility were occupied at the time, and that stuff was breaking down.</p>
<p>HL2 then was shockingly good, but due to the game taking so long to download i had to wait up to 10 minutes to load another level, so i remember what those loading points look like very well. The airboat and coast levels were great, before HL2 i never had such freedom of game, and it was the highest quality game i ever played up until then, and i think it still is the best game i’ve played up until now.</p>
<p>As for making levels, the first time i used Hammer, one day felt like a week, having such a slow internet connection that i couldn’t be distracted meant that i could basically focus entirely on experimenting. That was still the most fun i ever had making a level, discovering new things all the time. The 15 minute compile times were offsetting that a bit though.</p>
<p>All in all, Half-life changed my life, i’m now going to college doing computer sciences because i want to learn to program and get into the industry.</p>

            <p>This is tough for me to answer, because the first Half-Life I played was the PlayStation 2 port. It was okay, but I wouldn’t play it too often, and got bored with it. When I first loaded Half-Life up on the PC nearly a year later, I was blown away by all the game-play changes going from console to computer. Then I loaded up Half-Life 2, it was laggy as hell on the PC I had at the time, so it was difficult to really enjoy. Then I bought a PC meant for gaming and loaded it up, it was so fresh, so enjoyable; Truly worthy of the fact that I had to buy it twice <em>Let’s not get into that</em>.</p>

            <p>I played HL1 when it first came out and was excited to hear about part 2 coming out so that I could see the continuing adventures of Gordon Freeman.  When I first booted up HL2 and saw the G-Man’s face filling the screen, I giggled like a little girl.  Then he said “So, wake up, Mr. Freeman.  Wake up and…smell the ashes.”  I was like D:  This is gonna be awesome!</p>
<p>Then I was introduced to the police state that is City 17 and was I was like “WTF”?  It was almost completely unrecognizable as a Half-Life game.  It was beautiful, yes.  The graphics, the sound, but I was like…what happened?  Then I met Barney and I began giggling again and started to understand that it was some time later and I was thinking “What happened?”</p>
<p>As I played the game, I became aware of what happened over the last decade or more years after I destroyed Nihilanth and accepted the G-Man’s offer.  I enjoyed the airboat sequence getting to Black Mesa East (I giggled again, loving the references to Half Life 1) and finally understood what happened when I looked at the corkboard in Eli’s lab.</p>
<p>Then I went from “WTF, this isn’t Half Life” to “OMG, this is Half Life on steroids!”  Then I wanted more.  Then through the episodes (fucking Strider battle at the end of Ep2!) and, now, dammit, I want Episode 3 and Half Life 3!</p>

            <p>Half Life is my all time favorite game.  Ep.2 was great and I enjoyed every minute of game play.  But I was pissed when the game ended.  I thought I was going to fly a helicopter.  I know it was just an “episode”, but I was disappointed with all the long cut scenes and less game play than I expected.  Nevertheless, I still love it with Episode 2 being my favoriate.</p>

            <p>I only recently started gaming, rather late in life, because of <a href="https://xkcd.com/606/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this damn cartoon</a>. I played portal &gt; half-life &gt; half-life 2 in that order.</p>
<p>Half-life 2 wins for me: I was completely blown away. People are saying “atmosphere” and that’s exactly right, but the way that was so carefully put together to convey the feeling of being hounded through this colonised city - nothing’s come close since. Just been replaying it, and realising e.g. how important the female `voice of the combine’ is to that feel.</p>
<p>That’s partly why I felt the follow-on episodes dropped off a little: it didn’t all come together so perfectly to create a world with depths you could almost but not quite see.</p>
