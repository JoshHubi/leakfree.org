    <description>Hi,

the mortar control doesn&#39;t work every time. Especially after loading a savegame on that map I cannot see the crosshair on the screen where the airstrike should be triggered.

I needed to load the autosave in the vent, that falls down and run down all the way to have a working crosshair on screen.

As stated in another thread the performance is a little low on that map.</description>
