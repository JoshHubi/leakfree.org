    <title>Stutter, beep, crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stutter-beep-crash/10142</link>
    <description>First I&#39;ll say the conversion&#39;s fantastic. You folks really understand what made the original great, and even how to improve on what hindered it.

But, my game starts stuttering at random. Sometimes I play for 15 minutes before it happens, sometimes an hour. Then, soon, any keystroke gets a &quot;beep.&quot; Then before long it crashes to desktop. 

[url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12513&#39;]As requested[/url], I&#39;ve attached the minidump. I couldn&#39;t get a proper screenshot of the showbudget panel, but there were clearly spikes in SOUND and SWAP CACHE whenever it started stuttering.

I tried the [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12660&#39;]suggested fix for multi-core processors[/url]. It didn&#39;t fix the problem, though loading screens are dramatically quicker now  :slight_smile: 

System: i7, Mobility Radeon 5800 series, 8G RAM. Graphics are at the recommended settings (no AA, no vsync - even though my rig usually has no trouble with either).

Any ideas would be great. Cheers.
