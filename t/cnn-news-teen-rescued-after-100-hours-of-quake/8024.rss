    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cnn-news-teen-rescued-after-100-hours-of-quake/8024</link>
    <description>Just saw this on my RSS, now, how many of you thought this was about quake the game and never stopped to think that it could be a teen trapped in rubble after an earthquake?

Personally I though it was just some addicted kid to Quake the game lol...

Teen almost had a Heart Strogg lol</description>
