    <title>icudt42.dll Error on Starting TF2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/icudt42-dll-error-on-starting-tf2/11965</link>
    <description>I loaded up TF2 today, and it spit out a CEF Initialization Error. Apparently it couldn&#39;t load icudt42.dll. I googled it, and apparently it&#39;s a Unicode info driver from IBM. Perhaps a little foolishly, I went and deleted the .dll in question, hoping Steam would make me a new one. Now, it just quits to desktop on loading. Steam is verifying the game files in the background as I write this, in some hope to salvage what is obviously an important file. What do you think could be causing this?</description>

            <p>Unfortunately, I decided to do a complete reinstall before reading your post, thereby wasting 3 hours. Oops. Also unfortunately, I still get the crash to desktop or a “This game is unavailable” error.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks to the power of the Recycle Bin, I restored the .dlls in question, and it works again. Thanks anyway for helping, CPU.</p>
