    <title>Location of Crosshair File(s)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/location-of-crosshair-file-s/14667</link>
    <description>Does anyone know which VPK contains the file (or files) for the weapon crosshairs, and what the name/format is?  I had an idea that at least one of the crosshair files was a .ttf, but I couldn&#39;t find anything based off that.</description>
