    <title>npc follow console commands?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/npc-follow-console-commands/5635</link>
    <description>So yeah, I dunno if this is the right section to post it... I was going to post it to half-life series by error first... But nevermind. I&#39;ve been playing hl2,ep1 and Ep2 again to revive some of it&#39;s... moments. I just downloaded some good maps to also test and I thinked on spawning a vortigaunt and make him follow me around. My surprise: I don&#39;t know any command to make an npc follow the player. Like what alyx/barney/dog or the vort in the mine of ep2 did. I&#39;ve been searching and I did not find anything. So then I remembered the forum wich gave me some answers to some of my early questions about hl2 (or corrections) and this what I ask: Anyone knows anyform to make the NPCs follow you like barney or alyx did in hl2/Ep2?</description>

<p>Yeah, but I don’t have Gmod. Or not the steam version of it… (cause my parents don’t let me pay a shit if isn’t in a non-digital game shop.) So I can’t do a sh*t with it. That’s the cause I used GCF Scape and my console to put hl2 maps in ep2 and play some city 17 levels spawning hunters and zombines.</p>

<p>Yeah, I’ve been picking through those, too… haven’t had any luck yet.</p>

<p>Still, a scripted sequence would only follow a single path. It won’t stop for you or be all the time behind you and stopping when you do. That isn’t the same as following you like what the vort did in ep2 and the rebels and alyx did in all hl2 games. There are nodes wich allow the NPC to move around but still it follows you through that nodes.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s what I was thinking.  I don’t know enough about how the AI’s work to get any further though.  Been looking for a really good tutorial, but so far no luck and most of what I’ve learned about the console has been trial and error.</p>

            <p>I knew already the part of the citizens following me. And I checked all ent_fire (name) console commands of the vort. In ep2 Ent_fire !picker (aiming at a vort) Dispel is the best that I have never seen.</p>

            <p>Point your crosshair at the npc you have spawned, then in the console enter:</p>
<p>ent_setname !picker rebel</p>
<p>I haven’t gotten around to figuring out how to make them interact, talk, etc, but they will follow you around, take orders and shoot enemies (assuming you spawn them equipped with a weapon… I haven’t played with the vort yet, just citizens).</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Hmm… well, I’ve spawned a vort, and he/she/it/shclee will green-lightning attack any enemy within range… but can’t make he/she/it/shclee a companion that follows me around.  Anyone know how to do this?</p>
