    <title>A model with no collision?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-model-with-no-collision/9540</link>
    <description>It happened just after I acquired a crowbar.
I checked it multiple times, I can go into it just as if I was using noclip. What&#39;s even more strange, if I look away from it for a few seconds, it disappears (last picture).

Also... is this tie supposed to look like that?
