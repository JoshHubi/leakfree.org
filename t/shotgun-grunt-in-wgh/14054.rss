    <title>Shotgun Grunt in WGH</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shotgun-grunt-in-wgh/14054</link>
    <description>Just throwing it out there as a question, how come it was decided to add this guy by the surface elevator? I mean the obvious explanation was to give the player a new weapon to use on the next part of the level. But I kinda thought (and I assumed most others I think the same way) that the shotgun in the security booth at the end of the level was a bit of a reward for the player apon completing the it.  Is this so was he just placed there by accident? Either way im fine on the decision but I couldn&#39;t help but ask. :thumbup:</description>

            <p>I think it’s fine. You hardly get any ammo for it anyway, and by the time you actually get to it at the end of the level, it’s no longer as useful as it would have been had it been introduced earlier.</p>

            <p>I always thought it was a cheap tease to keep the shotgun away from you for the whole chapter when it would have been more fun to use it through the chapter instead.</p>

            <p>Agreed, I don’t fully understand the implementation of him. I’d prefer to receive the shotgun as a reward at the end of the chapter, like something you’d been working towards</p>
