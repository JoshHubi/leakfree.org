    <description>I know I&#39;ll stay, but who&#39;ll be leaving us?

That goes for the mods and devs, too.  Will you abandon us, Ram?</description>

            <p>Well, they clearly have <span class="bbcode-i">some</span> sense of humor.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, most forums these days just plain suck. Tons of trolls, and either there are too many people for anyone to really take notice of the other posters, or there are too few people such that you have to wait 2 weeks for something interesting to get posted. This place, on the other hand, has got it just right… sort of. Actually, you’re all nuts.</p>

            <p>You’d think that. Since L4D2 came out, I’ve had to play at 1700 ping for fairly sustained periods. 400 is absolute joy, trust me.</p>

<p>I played some L4D2 with some mates in the US recently and we were on good dedi servers and they were only getting 350-400 ping and actually not missing much. Their scores were right up with mine and I was on a ping of like 25.</p>
