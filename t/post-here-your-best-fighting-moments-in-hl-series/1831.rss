    <description>So:
there was this scene (I don&#39;t remember the level). Gordon is on a elevator, but, because of an explosion somewhere, the machine stops, creating some sort of a small ladder. Gordon kills soldiers and enters is some sort of bunker that gets it&#39;s entrance closed by debris.
That was only to try to let you remember the scene I was talking.
So, I don&#39;t know how, but I managed to kill 4 or 5 soldiers, one of them getting killed with a final crowbar attack, and arrived at this &quot;bunker&quot; entrance, climbed down the stairs and I DON&#39;T GOT ANY DAMAGE!!!</description>

<p>It’s not a joke, I wouldn’t joke about that. Besides, that poem is a generic poem used to honour all fallen soldiers (as in your team of unbeatable soldiers)</p>
<p>Ergo, not an ANZAC joke</p>

<p>They went with songs to the battle, they were young.<br>
Straight of limb, true of eyes, steady and aglow.<br>
They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted,<br>
They fell with their faces to the foe.<br>

Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.<br>
At the going down of the sun and in the morning,<br>
We will remember them.</p>

            <p>In ep2, during the ambush at the house where two hunters attack you. Was getting owned by them thinking “wtf they aren’t dying!” Then one of them ram me, sending me flying into a corner. I was about to give up but then noticed the dead cop beside me, he had the ar2 alt fire ammo. I picked it up and shot it at blank range. It hit the first hunter in the head that was running towards me and it went right down, hard. then the energy ball rebounded off it, against the wall, then against the second hunter that was firing flechettes at me. It hit the hunter in the face and sent it crashing into another room. I was like in awe for a few seconds, then regretted not being able to record that on video.</p>

            <p>The thing that I hated the most but felt great to accomplish was the Combine ambush in Nova Prospekt where all you had were three turret guns and your regular arsenal.  They just kept coming and it took Alyx forever and a day to get to you.</p>
<p>I was like, GODDAMMIT!  STOP KNOCKING OVER MY TURRETS!  &gt; <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>But it was still awesome and my heart was pounding afterwards.  I wanted to kill Alyx right then in there.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>The hopper mines only last half a wave for me unless I just place them on the ramp down to the vort, which works well for the final wave if you just fall back to the elevator shaft</p>

            <p>I was fighting some Combine Soldiers with my Vort buddy, and I managed to set of a chain reaction with my Mp7 grenades that destroyed 3 APCs, squashed all the normal soldiers, and killed an elite just as he was about to launch his altfire orb.<br>
Wait, ingame?<br>
Uh… I dunno. Probably something involving a squad of hgrunts.</p>

            <p>Hmm…<br>
I have no idea. Maybe getting squashed by a crashing gunship.</p>

            <p>The entire Breach sequence in Ep2, where the combine infiltrates the rocket facility. On hard mode, i executed a very efficient, almost graceful counter-attack using the gravity gun primarily, while taking minimal damage.</p>

            <p>I loved the part in the Lambda core, where you’re going to turn on one of the flood tanks (or… whatever those things are called… generators?) and AGrunts pretty much fill the room with all the catwalks in it.</p>
<p>Had to do some strategic hopping to get out of that one. :freeman:</p>

            <p>My favorite moment was one or the various times I went to the dam. I used the Tau Cannon to blow up the Helicopter just as it was over the water. The Icthyosaur was apparently at just the right place to get gibbed by the helicopter as it fell into the water. Happy times  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
