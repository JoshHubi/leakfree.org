    <title>First song of 2010 - &quot;Nihilist&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/first-song-of-2010-nihilist/2898</link>
    <description>...and it&#39;s noisy.

I haven’t felt all that inspired this year so far, but I got “California Dreaming” stuck in my head earlier today, which lead to me having, “The Sound of Silence” stuck in my head as well. Loop 20x Great.

So, I started writing a slow pop folk piano ballad to get it out of my system. I got the melody down and gasp ran out of ideas…so I doubled the speed, changed the piano to a synth, removed the tempo swing, added some Turrican bass and suddenly all was clear.

I KNEW WHAT HAD TOBE DONE.

What I ended up with is a sort of Chiptunes + Film Score + Rock kind of sound. Dunno really. I don’t like to get too crazy over genrefication.

Anyways, check it out:

<p>Um, that’s what the Show Off forum is for, strangely enough. It’d be nice if at least ONE of your posts didn’t insult another member.</p>
<p>EDIT: And so I’m not a hypocrite… I really enjoyed this. It’s not something I’d normally listen to, the only dance stuff I listen to is trance but this was good, as Guzzi above the piano break was a nice breather before the brutal D &amp; B / Garage drums kick in later on towards the end.</p>

            <p>I think the beginning doesn’t sound too bad. But what would be pretty cool is if after the song gets going is if you let off the synth a little and went with a more “authentic” instrument sound. (If that makes any sense) I really enjoyed the “strings” sound in the song.</p>
<p>There are points in the song that remind of Link to the past on regular Nintendo. But for the most part isn’t bad at all. I like the mellow piano break about 3/4 way through the song (from a listeners point of view it give them a chance to “breath” I guess you could say).</p>
<p>All I can say is don’t leave the song the way it is. As a fellow musician/singer song writer tweaking and refining on a song helps build skills and improves whatever song you’re working on.   Keep at it</p>
<pre><code>I'd show you one song I had been working on with someone I only had known for a few weeks but I don't know how to link music like you did. (Collaboration is an awesome tool as well.)</code></pre>

            <p>okay if you want to go “hey this isn’t that positive, I don’t need to take a look at why it provided a negative reaction” then go ahead</p>

            <p>That’s really cool. The intro sounds like something out of my old gameboy games. But the rest sounds pretty good, I don’t know how much time you spent on it but a little more tweaks and you could make it sound pro.</p>

            <p>…and it’s noisy.</p>
<p>I haven’t felt all that inspired this year so far, but I got “California Dreaming” stuck in my head earlier today, which lead to me having, “The Sound of Silence” stuck in my head as well. Loop 20x Great.</p>
<p>So, I started writing a slow pop folk piano ballad to get it out of my system. I got the melody down and gasp ran out of ideas…so I doubled the speed, changed the piano to a synth, removed the tempo swing, added some Turrican bass and suddenly all was clear.</p>
<p>I KNEW WHAT HAD TOBE DONE.</p>
<p>What I ended up with is a sort of Chiptunes + Film Score + Rock kind of sound. Dunno really. I don’t like to get too crazy over genrefication.</p>
<p>Anyways, check it out:</p>
