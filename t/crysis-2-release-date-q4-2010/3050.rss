    <title>Crysis 2 - release date Q4 2010</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crysis-2-release-date-q4-2010/3050</link>
    <description>Gamereactor - Cevat Yerli Q&amp;A

We picked up a copy of the Finnish Gamereactor magazine and made a list of all of the relevant stuff from the featured interview:

- You play as Jake &#39;Nomad&#39; Dunn.
- Compared to Crysis there will be more freedom, larger gameplay areas and more tactical warfare.
- Nanosuit 2 will give players more freedom in how to tackle situations in the battlefield.
- The different aspects of nanosuit 2 are designed to further encourage experimental and fit-for-your-own-style usage of nanosuit&#39;s features.
- Cevat thinks that the weakest parts of Crysis were 1) the story, which lacked originality and details 2) the on-rails gameplay style in the end and 3) that there were no console versions.
- Compared to the majority of console games, the console gamers will see Crysis 2&#39;s freedom and openness as a new and interesting gameplay style.
- The player has again the freedom of choosing what weapons to use and how to use them, or how to take advantage of the environment.
- Crysis 2 will again feature the familiar &quot;Veni Vidi Vici&quot; (I came, I saw, I conquered) gameplay style.
- In Crysis 2 Crytek will, of course, try to surpass the previous Crysis games in graphical splendour and technical features.
- Setting the events of Crysis 2 to New York City was a result of a long thought process; Crytek did not choose New York City because of &quot;console limitations&quot;.
- With three previous games set in the jungle Crytek decidedly wanted to avoid making a fourth &quot;jungle game&quot;.
- New York as the setting was chosen in the early stages of development; Crytek wanted to see Nomad in a metropol and make the area as a huge sandbox for the player.
- Compared to jungle, urban environment offers more opportunities for gameplay based on vertical differences and the player will have more freedom to choose how to progress and plan out attacks.
- Player will be able to, for example, jump between floors and buildings, and roll down along a crater wall.
- Cevat did not want to share details on Crysis 2 multiplayer... yet.
- The transition from one nanosuit ability to another will be &quot;softened&quot; in Crysis 2: for a short while before speed changes to power, the player will have both abilities in his possession.
- In the battle against the aliens, New York City will offer plenty of architecture that the player can destroy, protect, climb on and take advantage of.
- Fighting against the alien invasion will be &quot;catastrophically beautiful&quot;.
- Crytek have tried to actively avoid of using dark dystopian colors and tones that have been plaguing many games these days.
- Details on the story will not be revealed until summer.

            <p>Here’s a legit gameplay video that GT just got today or yesterday, however it was originally on GT TV which really detracts from the gameplay itself.  However, some nice person made an excellent compiliation of the fresh vids so:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvtn-01R-6M" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvtn-01R-6M</a></p>

            <p>I am quite curious as to how good the sequel will be, judging from the new trailer it looks quite good. In my opinion I thought Crysis 1 was a great game</p>

            <p>The first one was, meh…entertaining, it was fun to throw chinese guys into the ocean, get eaten by sharks, etc<br>
This one seems better since there are aliens from the beginning and not like half of the game as the first one, which is when it got interesting</p>
<p>So, who knows, this prototype in first person may be good =P (I’m tired of new york as being the entire world =P)</p>

            <p>Like how the first crysis was “open world”?</p>
<p>And when they say that they mean one side of the road is a sheer drop and the other side is a steep cliff face?</p>

<p>I felt like trollan, so yes bscly BM forums.</p>
<p>So I really wonder how they’re going to do “open world” in this game, or if it’s just a gimmick they’re using. Most games don’t do open world well…</p>

            <p>The aliens and a private military company called Crynet Systems are fighting over what’s left of New York City. Cevat has mentioned Crysis 2 will have a much deeper storyline than the first game. It’s a bit like Half-Life, in the first game you see how the shit starts and in the second you play in the aftermath.</p>
<p>From the new trailer it seems pretty obvious this game is NOTHING like the first, no longer being in the jungle is going to be a huge difference obviously. I’m really looking forward to this.</p>

            <p>I just found an article on game informer that is much more descriptive and telling than the IGN one. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/crysis_2/b/xbox360/archive/2010/04/09/crysis-2-first-look.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gameinformer.com/games/crysis_2/b/xbox360/archive/2010/04/09/crysis-2-first-look.aspx</a></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/moonpooman">@Moonpooman</a>  yes but one would assume that they would have a more coordinated attack on closer targets and work their way out rather than spreading all over the globe and attacking instantly. It also would make zero point to do a coordinated evac. The government wouldn’t have the resources to evac every major city, and then comes the problem of where they would evac to. And if every major city was attacked at the same time then why would Nomad/psycho/prophet head to NYC of all places after having just been in the pacific. Seems like they would move to defend the nearest fall back point that everyone is evacing to rather than out and about in an evacuated city on the other side of the continent. I can understand they wanted the game’s setting to be in New York, it just doesn’t make any geographical sense with what little information we have been given.</p>

<p>Anyone else notice they changed what the alien grunts look like quite a bit? It looks like they changed the entire color palate associated with the aliens. The alien grunts are now mostly black with red eyes instead of black with icy blues, teals and purples. They also seemed to be hanging out near the dark black shell of the buildings with the red fire on the inside and around them. These ones also look like they can stand up on two legs like people if they want to, yet still crawl most of the time like the xenomorphs from aliens.</p>

<p>I’m still waiting to hear how they plan to justify the aliens attacking New York instead of somewhere on the west coast considering that it’s closer. The only thing I can think of is that help arrived from off world for the aliens and a second ship landed in the Atlantic, but that leaves me to wonder about the fate of the aliens on the west coast. Their numbers where were immense, they definitely posed a threat by themselves.</p>

</aside>
<p>i think they just added another type of alien, for variation, and wanted to show it off to see what the response would be.</p>
<p>“Why New York?”<br>
Did you happen to look up at the sky during the last level of crysis 1? The whole sky was filled of those flying octopus-thingies. It literally looked like the entire mountain had turned into them. It looked like it was enough to attack every major city in the world.</p>
<p>Also, is anyone else wondering why they flew back into the the fozen zone of the Island? With temperature below -200 Celsius? Wouldn’t that freeze that scientist/archeolog/whatever they brought with them? Instantly?</p>

<p>The old suit looked much better, this one looks like a gorilla. Not only in third person but the first person model takes up like 1/4 of the screen:</p>

</aside>
<p>I know, I thought the exact same thing! It looks like someone peeled back the flesh on the gorilla, painted it black and all while adding a silver thong to cover up its oversized junk. Oh well, its not called a FPS for nothing, we’ll probably never see ourselves that much to care.</p>
<p>I think the reason why his gun and arms take up a 1/4 of the screen is because he is looking up. Play almost any 3rd person shooter and when you look up you see more of your gun and arms, and when you look down you see less of your gun and arms.</p>
