    <title>[SINGLEPLAYER] Walk not working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/singleplayer-walk-not-working/13927</link>
    <description>The ability to bind walk has been added to the official Steam version of Black Mesa; the original mod didn&#39;t allow that option.

[b]However, walking doesn&#39;t seem to work.[/b]  No matter which key it&#39;s bound to, it simply has no affect on my speed (I&#39;ve tested both pressing it as a toggle, and holding it down like as it works in most other Source engine games).

I tested this for singleplayer.</description>
