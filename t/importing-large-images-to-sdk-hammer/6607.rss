    <title>Importing large images to SDK Hammer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/importing-large-images-to-sdk-hammer/6607</link>
    <description>I assume some of you are experienced mappers with the Source SDK, so you might be able to answer this..  How can I import a large image file, such as a blueprint, into SDK Hammer to model from?  I have an ongoing arch project, and I&#39;d like to model the project within a game engine with an imported blueprint to reference from.  Any ideas?

It sounds like regular textures and materials would distort the blueprint.</description>

            <p>how big is the texture anyways?</p>
<p>For a start, download vtfedit. install that.<br>
Open up your blueprint in vtfedit.</p>
<p>I personally use,<br>
normal format : BGR888<br>
alpha format : BGR888<br>
Texture type : Animated texture.</p>
<p>The max image resolution as far as im aware is about 4096x4096 which you might use if you were importing a highly detailed model texture. For your use, i think 2048x2048 is the very limit i would go for a mere blueprint. It would have to be a pretty bloody detailed blueprint if it was gonna be that big.</p>
<p>Make a folder in your textures folder called whatever you want.  Save your blueprint in that.</p>
<p>Now click tools - create vmt file.</p>
<p>click on options and select what surface you want it to be (dont matter since nobody will walk on it or shoot it ever)</p>
<p>Click create and save it in the folder you made. (the same one as the blueprint you saved)</p>
<p>Your done. Open hammer and slap it on a brush.</p>
<p>Edit: wtfs a .skp file?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the answers guys…I actually managed to import a blueprint into Sketchup, with a plugin that can export Sketchup files into .vmt to open in Hammer.  Worked pretty well when I used a test model.  However…I can’t seem to open one of the Sketchup-made .vmt files in Hammer.</p>
<p>I’d really appreciate it if someone would like to take a look at the file (the .skp or the .vmt) and check what’s wrong.</p>

            <p>Short answer: you can’t.<br>
Long answer: (as above) Split your blueprint up into 1024x1024 sections, convert each section to a usable texture, then stick that texture onto a 1024x1024 brush and work form there.</p>

            <p>hammer is not blender, but you could put a bunch of 2d brushes separated into 1024x1024 textures I guess</p>
